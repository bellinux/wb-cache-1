5|$|Heathens {{commonly}} adopt a cosmology {{based on}} that found in Norse mythology. As part of this framework, humanity's world—known as Midgard—is regarded as just one of nine realms, {{all of which are}} part of a cosmological world tree called Yggdrasil. Different types of being are believed to inhabit these different realms; for instance, humans live on Midgard, while dwarves live on another realm, elves on another, giants on another, and the divinities on two further realms. Most practitioners believe that this is a poetic or symbolic description of the cosmos, with the different levels representing higher realms beyond the material plane of existence. The world tree is also interpreted by some in the community as an icon for ecological and social engagement. Some Heathens, such as the psychologist Brian Bates, have adopted an <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> cosmology rooted in analytical psychology, thereby interpreting the nine worlds and their inhabitants as maps of the human mind.|$|E

25|$|Often these {{conditional}} distributions include parameters {{which are}} unknown {{and must be}} estimated from data, sometimes using the maximum likelihood approach. Direct maximization of the likelihood (or of the posterior probability) is often complex when there are unobserved variables. A classical <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> problem is the expectation-maximization algorithm which alternates computing expected values of the unobserved variables conditional on observed data, with maximizing the complete likelihood (or posterior) assuming that previously computed expected values are correct. Under mild regularity conditions this process converges on maximum likelihood (or maximum posterior) values for parameters.|$|E
25|$|Folie et déraison {{received}} a mixed reception in France and in foreign journals focusing on French affairs. Although it was critically acclaimed by Maurice Blanchot, Michel Serres, Roland Barthes, Gaston Bachelard, and Fernand Braudel, {{it was largely}} ignored by the leftist press, much to Foucault's disappointment. It was notably criticised for advocating metaphysics by young philosopher Jacques Derrida in a March 1963 lecture at the University of Paris. Responding with a vicious retort, Foucault criticised Derrida's interpretation of René Descartes. The two remained bitter rivals until reconciling in 1981. In the English-speaking world, the work became a significant influence on the anti-psychiatry movement during the 1960s; Foucault took a mixed <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> associating {{with a number of}} anti-psychiatrists but arguing that most of them misunderstood his work.|$|E

25|$|Luke's {{understanding}} of Jesus – his Christology – {{is central to}} his theology. One <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> is through the titles Luke gives to Jesus: these include, {{but are not limited}} to, Christ (Messiah), Lord, Son of God, and Son of Man. Another is by reading Luke in the context of similar Greco-Roman divine saviour figures (Roman emperors are an example), references which would have made clear to Luke's readers that Jesus was the greatest of all saviours. A third is to approach Luke through his use of the Old Testament, those passages from Jewish scripture which he cites to establish that Jesus is the promised Messiah. While much of this is familiar, much also is missing: for example, Luke makes no clear reference to Christ's pre-existence or to the Christian's union with Christ, and makes relatively little reference to the concept of atonement: perhaps he felt no need to mention these ideas, or disagreed with them, or possibly he was simply unaware of them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{examines}} {{a simulation}} of the Beer Distribution Game {{and a number}} of optimisation <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> game. This well known game was developed at MIT in the 1960 s and has been widely used to educate graduate students and business managers on the dynamics of supply chains. This game offers a complex simulation environment involving multidimensional constrained parameters. In this research we have examined a traditional genetic algorithm <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> optimising <b>this</b> game, while also for the first time examining a particle swarm optimisation approach. Optimisation is used to determine the best ordering policies across an entire supply chain. This paper will present experimental results for four com-plex customer demand patterns. We will examine the efficacy of our optimisation approaches and analyse the implications of the results on the Beer Distribution Game. Our experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of both genetic algorithm and particle swarm <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> complex problem. We will outline a direct comparison of these results, and present a series of conclusions relating to the Beer Distribution Game. I...|$|R

500|$|Stelmach's <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> deteriorating fiscal situation, part of {{a global}} recession, was to invest heavily in {{infrastructure}} {{in an effort to}} stimulate the economy and take advantage of low construction costs. [...] He went as far as to advocate borrowing for capital construction, a departure from the Klein government's notoriously anti-debt approach. [...] However, his government was also one of only two in Canada (the other being Saskatchewan's) to cut overall spending in the 2009–2010 budget. This approach drew the ire of Liberal leader David Swann, who supported increased government spending for economic stimulus purposes, but drew support from some economists and was defended by Evans on the basis that capital spending was at twice the per capital level of the Canadian average.|$|E

[...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic gave the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote, [...] "There were bits and pieces of each story that worked in 'Pool Party,' but neither Robert's stroll through parties never had, nor Erin's endeavor to make Andy jealous, came together to make completely funny or interesting tales." [...] The Huffington Post wrote that, [...] "Once , the plot bits were so loose it might have been difficult for casual fans to follow it all." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, Pool Party' was one of those episodes where you can tell the writers didn't know what else to do....

[...] Many reviews were critical of the continued Erin-Andy romance taking center-stage. McNutt wrote, [...] "I still really do not care about Andy and Erin as a relationship.
