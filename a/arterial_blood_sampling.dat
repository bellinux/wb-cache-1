40|$|A {{blood culture}} {{technique}} that utilized small <b>arterial</b> <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> or peripheral capillary blood was tested in beagle dogs and pig-tailed macaque monkeys. A bolus of 2. 0 × 107 Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) was injected intravenously into five animals of each species. <b>Blood</b> <b>samples</b> were taken before injection of the organisms and 10, 15, 20, 30, 60, and 120 min after injection. <b>Arterial</b> <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> (2. 0 and 0. 2 ml) and peripheral capillary samples (0. 14 ml) were taken at each sampling time.

30|$|The {{tidal volume}} {{was reduced to}} 2 / 3 of the initial settings. After 1  h and every 15  min thereafter, <b>arterial</b> <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> were drawn.

Hypercapnia was considered stable if three consecutive <b>arterial</b> <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> had a pH in the desired range and if the PaCO 2 varied less than 3 % in those measurements.
