40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an automated method for {{the synthesis of}} multiple-input-change (MIC) <b>asynchronous</b> state <b>machines.</b> <b>Asynchronous</b> state <b>machine</b> design is subtle since, unlike synchronous synthesis, logic must be implemented without hazards, and state codes must be chosen carefully to avoid critical races. We formulate and solve an optimal hazard-free and critical race-free encoding problem for a class of MIC <b>asynchronous</b> state <b>machines</b> called burst-mode. Analogous to a paradigm successfully used for the optimal encoding of synchronous machines, the problem is formulated as an input encoding problem. Implementations are targeted to sum-of-product realizations. We {{believe this is the}} first general method for the optimal encoding of hazard-free MIC <b>asynchronous</b> state <b>machines</b> under a generalized fundamental mode of operation. Results indicate that improved solutions are produced, ranging up to 17 % improvement. ...|$|R

50|$|For {{quite some}} time, {{asynchronous}} motors with distributed winding {{account for the}} major share of electric motors across the globe. In automobile construction, in particular {{in the area of}} electric mobility, the <b>asynchronous</b> <b>machine</b> with distributed winding can excellently be deployed. It is due to the long history of the asynchronous motor, that this manufacturing process, the insertion technique, is widely applied. In contrast to concentrated winding, not every tooth pole is winded in the case of distributed winding; instead, coils are introduced to the stator slots covering multiple tooth poles. Because of the fact that, due to its tendon-like position of the coils, the already introduced winding covers the stator slots that need to be equipped with coils, it is often necessary to insert a complete phase winding during the same time.Coil insertion machines insert prefabricated groups of coils into the stators of electric motors. The coil groups are frequently manufactured with flyer winding machines and put onto the insertion tool with a transfer instrument. In small-batch manufacturing, the coil groups are relocated manually from the winding masks to the insertion tool using transfer instruments. Subsequently, it is by using the insertion tool that the coil groups are inserted into the previously attached stator whose slots have been insulated with e.g. insulation paper. When diagonally winding the coil into the slot of the stator, the coil's internal width must be larger than the stator's height which leads to the formation of the large winding head that is characteristic for the insertion technique.|$|E

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{experimental and}} analytical {{determination of the}} <b>asynchronous</b> <b>machine</b> equivalent-circuit parameters with application of the reference data. Transient processes investigation of the asynchronous machines necessitates the equivalent circuit parameters (resistance impedance, inductances and coefficient of the stator-rotor contours mutual inductance) that help form the transitory-process mathematical simulation model. The reference books do not provide those parameters; they instead give the rated ones (active power, voltage, slide, coefficient of performance and capacity coefficient) {{as well as the}} ratio of starting and nominal currents and torques.

The paper presents experimental and analytical determinations of the <b>asynchronous</b> <b>machine</b> equivalent-circuit parameters: the experimental one {{based on the results of}} two measurements and the analytical one where the problem boils down to solving a system of nonlineal algebraic equations.

40|$|<b>Asynchronous</b> <b>machines</b> (induction machines) {{are widely}} used in the industry. A high trustiness is {{required}} since an interruption of the operation due to a voltage dip can result in both economical losses and safety problems. An example is the security system in {{a nuclear power plant}} that includes a high number of <b>asynchronous</b> <b>machines</b> which are driving important pumps and fans. It is therefore of high interest to know how these machines respond to irregular voltages. This master thesis deals with the dynamical response of <b>asynchronous</b> <b>machines</b> exposed to voltage dips. This is done by simulations in Simulink using the fifth order Park model. To verify the results, simulations of a 4 kW machine has been compared with measurements on a laboratory set-up. Both simulations and measurements are based on disturbance profiles compiled by OKG, the owner of Oskarshamn nuclear power plant. The results from the simulations agree well with the measurements. It is shown that the speed of the machine is decreased when it is exposed to a decreased voltage. When the voltage recovers the machine draws a higher current from the source due to the magnetization and the acceleration. The magnitude of the current depends on the duration of the dip and on the magnitude of the remaining voltage. Lightly loaded machines are less affected by voltage dips, under- and over-voltages. This is something that is taken into account by OKG when dimensioning. The aim is to load the machine to a level where the stator current is at rated level when the voltage level is at 85 percent of rated. It means that the machines simulated in this project withstand most of the Disturbance Profiles...|$|R

40|$|The article {{continues}} the aviation electro mechanics drive-generating aggregate structure research and aims {{to form the}} recommendations for getting the best possible combination of operating performance of such aggregate. Using the motoring of <b>asynchronous</b> <b>machine</b> on the first stage and the circulation of active-power related {{to it in the}} aggregate con- tour require synchronous generator over motoring in proportion to the required shaft speed rotation of the generator. Due to the difficulty to provide the required value of <b>asynchronous</b> <b>machine</b> moment, when starting it with AC or DC, one should give preference to the asynchronous brake (in this case the necessity for the source of direct-current is eliminated and the scheme realization of the mode is simplified). The development of differential asynchronously-synchronous drive- generating aggregate with three generator stages of <b>asynchronous</b> <b>machine</b> allows decreasing the value of synchronous generator electromagnetic power, to provide the high average value of aggregate performance efficiency. Applied to mod- ern turbo-engines which continuous work is only possible at certain fixed rotation speed, the number of generator aggregate operational stages and operation modes of <b>asynchronous</b> <b>machine</b> need to be chosen in order to provide the best possible indexes exactly at these speeds, assuming the relatively large values of losses at brief transient operational modes of aircraft engine.
