The surface force at x=L is a combined cycle load, {{defined as the}} sum of two sines of frequencies F and F/ξ. For this case of study, the assumption (26) is verified, since the two loading frequencies are F= 0.05 Hz and F/ξ = 500 Hz (cyclic loads with respective <b>amplitudes</b> 1 <b>kN</b> and 0.25 kN) and the material considered is a typical steel (E= 200 GPa and ρ = 7, 800 kg m^- 3). Moreover, the damping ratio c_K is equal to 10 ^- 5, hence verifying assumption (27).|$|R

40|$|Starting from {{a recent}} model where the ¯ <b>KN</b> <b>amplitudes</b> are {{evaluated}} from the chiral Lagrangians using a coupled channel unitary method, we evaluate here the scattering length for K − deuteron scattering. We find that the double scattering contribution is very large compared to the impulse approximation and that the charge exchange contribution of this rescattering is {{as large as the}} sequential K − scattering on the two nucleons. Higher order rescattering corrections are evaluated using coupled channels Faddeev equations with K − and ¯ K 0. The higher order corrections involving intermediate pions and hyperons are found negligible. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{imaginary}} helicity non-flip omega exchange <b>amplitudes</b> in <b>KN</b> and NN scattering {{are determined}} versus t and s from data on elastic {{differential cross section}} differences. The omega -universality prediction Im omega /sub N/(t) = 3 Im omega /sub K/(t), {{is found to be}} satisfied for 0 <or= mod t mod <or= 0. 5, indicating that the absorptive cuts as small t preserve universality. The impact parameter distributions of the omega amplitudes show: (i) a peripheral peak centred around b approximately= 1 fm, with Delta b approximately =+or- 0. 5 fm in KN and Delta b approximately=+or- 0. 75 fm in NN; (ii) a sizeable negative contribution at small b, more negative in NN than in KN, (iii) a smaller tail of negative contributions around b approximately= 2 fm. Strong absorption of the omega -pole imaginary amplitude with lambda values around two is needed to reproduced this structure. A new version of the absorption model suggested by pi N amplitude analysis, is confirmed by the results. (20 refs) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the premise}} of {{mechanics}} model and the kinetic equation, the numerical simulation model of pile-soil system has been established with MATLAB, and the numerical analytic solution of kinetic equation has been got by fourth-order Runge-Kutta. And the relationship curves between the pile-soil interface’s friction and time, displacement, acceleration and velocity of the pile have been mainly studied when the exciting <b>amplitude</b> is 100 <b>kN,</b> 200 kN respectively. With the work, the exciting amplitude will be obtained. In this way, the friction of the pile-soil can be decreased and work efficiency can be improved; besides this paper can also provide a further theoretical basis of pile pressing machine's dynamic optimization...|$|R
40|$|High {{statistics}} {{data for}} the reactions K*p- K*n+n at 13 GeV have been ob-tained in a spectrometer experiment performed at SLAC, For each reaction, a t-dependent parametrization of the production amplitudes provides information on both the Kn mass dependence of the production mechanisms and on Klr scat-tering. Knowledge of the t-dependence then allows a calculation of the Kx par-tial wave <b>amplitudes</b> for <b>Kn</b> masses from 007 to 1. 9 GeV. Besides the leading Jp = l-, 2 +, and 3 - resonances at MKr = D 896, 1. 433, and 1, 78 GeV, there is evidence {{in two of the}} four possible partial wave solutions for a broad P-wave resonant-like structure in the region of 1700 MeV. The K+r+ reaction is dom-inated by S-wave scattering with a total cross section of 5. 2 mb. The I = &S-wave magnitude rises slowly and smoothly to a maximum near 1400 MeV, but then decreases rapidly between 1400 and 1600 MeV. This structure may pos-sibly be associated with an S-wave resonance near 1500 MeV, Both the I = &S-wave below 1400 MeV and the I = 3 / 2 S-wave are well described by an effective range parametrization...|$|R
40|$|We {{calculate}} KN {{elastic scattering}} phase shifts at Born order in a quark interchange model with one-gluon exchange and linear scalar confinement. We find that quark-gluon forces are insufficient {{to explain the}} experimentally large spin-orbit interaction, especially evident in the P-waves. DN scattering amplitudes are simply related to the <b>KN</b> <b>amplitudes,</b> the only new parameter being the charm quark mass, and phase shifts for DN scattering are calculated. No DN bound states are found. Phase shifts for K*N elastic scattering are calculated, and the formalism developed may be easily generalized to the scattering of hadrons of arbitrary spins. Inelasticities in KN scattering are large experimentally, and {{as a first step}} toward including the inelastic contribution to the elastic scattering phase shifts we compute the KN → K*N scattering amplitudes. Finally, we develop the model for J/ y - nucleon scattering and calculate cross sections for the reactions J/ y → D 0 S + c, D 0 L + c, and D - * S ++ c. </math...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the results of}} experiments to demonstrate {{the use of a}} mini- trampoline as a structural vibration exciter. The exciter comes in two sections, the first is the human power source that provides vertical reciprocating motion and inertial mass, and the second is the trampoline membrane that is spring-tensioned. A human vibration exciter is thus established {{with the use of the}} mini-trampoline that can be used to determine floor structural stiffness values and frequency response functions amplitudes at the excitation frequency and its higher harmonics. The mini-trampoline static properties such as spring and membrane stiffness were determined from load-deflection tests and the dynamic properties such as natural reciprocating frequency and transmitted force were obtained using accelerometer and force transducers. The frequency range of the mini-trampoline can be varied between 2 to 2. 6 Hz by employing people of various weights and through the use of different diameter discs on top of the membrane. The important point is that a vertical harmonic force of about 1 <b>kN</b> <b>amplitude</b> can be obtained at 2 Hz for testing of floors, foot bridges and roofs. This testing system is easily portable and measurements of force and response can be measured consecutively using only one accelerometer. Results of tests for stiffness and natural frequencies of a sample foot- bridge are presented...|$|R
40|$|The K-matrix {{formalism}} for the {{low energy}} KN interaction is reviewed. By using the N/D method to compute the scattering matrix for left hand singularities chosen to approximate the physical singularities of the <b>KN</b> and ΣΤ <b>amplitudes</b> {{the nature of the}} energy dependence of the inverse K-matrix elements are investigated. From this it is concluded that an effective range parameterisation should be a good approximation to the inverse K-matrix elements and that the off diagonal elements of the effective range matrix may not, ά priori, be neglected. The application of dispersion relations to the prediction of the strange particle coupling constants is discussed. A once subtracted sum rule is introduced which reduces the discrepancy in the prediction of the coupling constants due to the use of different low energy parameterisations for the <b>KN</b> <b>amplitude.</b> The resultant prediction of the coupling constants is incompatible with the SU(3) predictions. A new S-wave zero range fit to the low energy KN data is performed. A good fit is obtained which improves on previous analyses over the low energy KN region. The values of the coupling constants predicted by the standard dispersion relation using this parameterisation are again incompatible with the SU(3) predictions. Finally the effect of the non-negligible P waves in the isospin one channel are investigated using a constant scattering length parameterisation for these waves in the analysis of the low energy KN data...|$|R
