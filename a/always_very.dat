5|$|The red-billed chough's loud, ringing chee-ow call is {{clearer and}} {{louder than the}} similar {{vocalisation}} of the jackdaw, and <b>always</b> <b>very</b> {{different from that of}} its yellow-billed congener, which has rippling preep and whistled sweeeooo calls. Small subspecies of the red-billed chough have higher frequency calls than larger races, as predicted by the inverse relationship between body size and frequency.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is {{inclined}} only about 5.145° to the ecliptic and the Sun is <b>always</b> <b>very</b> near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun and Moon, but only when the Moon is near an ascending or descending node {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. The ecliptic is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the Moon crossed it.|$|E
5|$|In May 2001, Narayan was hospitalised. A {{few hours}} before {{he was to be}} put on a ventilator, he was {{planning}} on writing his next novel, a story about a grandfather. As he was <b>always</b> <b>very</b> selective about his choice of notebooks, he asked N. Ram to get him one. However, Narayan did not get better and never started the novel. He died on 13 May 2001, in Chennai at the age of 94.|$|E

25|$|During {{the summer}} rains {{are common in}} the late afternoon. Temperatures at this time are <b>always</b> <b>very</b> high. In the winter the arrival of polar air masses that drop and cause frost. In {{this time of year}} the {{relative}} humidity is too low, and causes discomfort to the population.|$|E
25|$|While Gryce {{was a very}} {{accomplished}} saxophonist, clarinetist, and flautist {{his playing}} tended to be less innovative than his writing. As a saxophonist he was <b>always</b> <b>very</b> much influenced by Charlie Parker, who he had always idolized and became friends with in the mid-fifties. Contemporaries recall that Parker would sometimes borrow Gryce's horn.|$|E
25|$|Hecker was <b>always</b> <b>very</b> much a {{favourite}} {{with all}} the German democrats. The song ("Heckerlied") and the hat named after him (a broad slouch hat with a feather) became famous as the symbols of the middle-classes in revolt. In America he won great esteem, not only on political grounds but also for his personal qualities.|$|E

25|$|In another {{variation}} of the rounded bow fibula, the bow became fat and swollen-looking. In many of these Leech Bow, or Sanguisaga, fibulae the catch plate became large and triangular. Another variant, the Certossa type, had a small square or ribbon cross-section bow and a short bilateral spring (possibly the first use of a bilateral spring). Certossa fibulae are almost <b>always</b> <b>very</b> small.|$|E
25|$|The {{bread is}} almost <b>always</b> <b>very</b> low in fat, its content {{comparable}} to most other varieties of bread. It contains no added oils or fats. Additional flavourings, other than salt, can include barley malt syrup. It {{is rich in}} whole grain and dietary fiber and contains little or no sugar, and is thus considered by many Danes as a healthy alternative to whiter types of bread.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{spectral}} designations {{were based}} on inferences of an asteroid's composition. However, the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not <b>always</b> <b>very</b> good, {{and a variety of}} classifications are in use. This has led to significant confusion. Although asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials, there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of similar materials.|$|E

25|$|Eltham High Street {{lies on the}} A210, the {{original}} A20 London to Maidstone road. But the A20 has now been diverted southwards, passing through Mottingham, {{and it is a}} dual carriageway that connects to the M20 motorway in Kent. Similarly, to the north, the dual carriageway A2 has replaced the Rochester Road section, which was <b>always</b> <b>very</b> congested (the old road had dangerous readings of lead pollution, close to schools, before the advent of lead-free petrol).|$|E
25|$|Each Sunday {{evening the}} {{basilica}} holds Solemn Vespers {{and a special}} service during Advent, known as Lessons and Carols. Stations of the Cross is celebrated each Friday during the season of Lent. At other times throughout the year, the basilica hosts special liturgies of all kinds. The Paschal Triduum is celebrated every Easter and it lasts from Holy Thursday with {{the celebration of the}} Last Supper until Easter Sunday with Vespers. These celebrations are very popular among students and local inhabitants, and Easter liturgies are <b>always</b> <b>very</b> crowded.|$|E
25|$|A {{sedimentary}} rock formed on land has a continental sedimentary environment. Examples of continental environments are lagoons, lakes, swamps, floodplains and alluvial fans. In the quiet water of swamps, lakes and lagoons, fine sediment is deposited, mingled with organic material from dead plants and animals. In rivers, {{the energy of}} the water is much greater and can transport heavier clastic material. Besides transport by water, sediment can in continental environments also be transported by wind or glaciers. Sediment transported by wind is called aeolian and is <b>always</b> <b>very</b> well sorted, while sediment transported by a glacier is called glacial till and is characterized by very poor sorting.|$|E

25|$|The myth's {{results can}} only be {{replicated}} by expanding some parameters of the myth by a realistic and reasonable margin. This {{may have been due}} to facts of the myth having been altered slightly over time by it being told and re-told {{by the time it was}} tested by the MythBusters. Also, certain materials may have had to be substituted for others in some cases as a matter of necessity during the course of the myth being tested, but the new materials are almost <b>always</b> <b>very</b> similar to the materials specified and usually are readily available, so as to prevent it from being prohibitively costly or impractical.|$|E
25|$|Relative {{humidity}} is <b>always</b> <b>very</b> high, {{particularly in}} the mornings. High humidity produces brief morning fog in the early summer and a usually persistent low cloud deck during the winter (generally developing in May and persisting into late November or even early December). The predominantly onshore flow makes the Lima area one of the cloudiest among the entire Peruvian coast. Lima has only 1284 hours of sunshine a year, 28.6 hours in July and 184 hours in April, which is exceptionally little for the latitude. Winter cloudiness prompts locals to seek for sunshine in Andean valleys located at elevations generally above 500 meters above sea level.|$|E
25|$|The tourism trade {{continues}} to be {{a major part of the}} local economy with Scarborough being the second most-visited destination in England by British holidaymakers. While weekend and mid-week-break trade are tending to replace the traditional week-long family holiday, the beaches and attractions are <b>always</b> <b>very</b> busy throughout summer, a marked contrast to the quieter winter months when Scarborough is often seen as a peaceful bolt-hole from cities such as Leeds and Bradford. Confidence in the hospitality industry is high, evidenced by major refits in recent years, often targeted at a higher-spending clientele. Significant amongst these is the Grand, Scarborough's biggest hotel, which overlooks the South Bay, and also the Palm Court Hotel.|$|E
