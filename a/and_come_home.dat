25|$|For the 2009 season, Menard {{moved over}} to the No. 98 Ford Fusion {{operated}} by Yates Racing. Menard showed limited improvement in 2009, running in the top 10 many times, only to later have problems. For example, he crashed at Las Vegas Motor Speedway while running very well, and {{was involved in a}} wreck with only 40 laps to go, while running 7th. These issues lead to the team being in danger of falling out of the top 35 in points standings for much of the year. Menard's best finishes included two 13th-place finishes in the Aarons 499 at Talladega Superspeedway as well as the Samsung 500 at Texas Motor Speedway, and a 15th-place finish in the Southern 500. At the second Dover race, Menard started 10th and ran in the top 10 for most of the day, only to find his car tighten up {{near the end of the}} race <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> 19th. At the end of the 2009 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, Menard was the only driver to not score a top 10 finish who ran all of the races. Menard ended up finishing 31st in the final point standings.|$|E

He set career highs with 222 hits, 136 runs, 580 at-bats, and 52 stolen bases. Speaker's stolen base tally was a team record until Tommy Harper stole 54 bases in 1973. He batted [...]383 and his [...]567 {{slugging}} percentage was the highest of his dead-ball days. [...] Speaker set a major league single-season record with three hitting streaks of twenty or more games (30, 23, and 22). He also became the first major leaguer to hit 50 doubles and steal 50 bases in the same season. In August, Speaker's mother unsuccessfully attempted to convince him to quit baseball <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>home.</b> In Fenway Park's first game, Speaker drove in the winning run in the 11th inning, giving Boston the 7–6 win.|$|E

2500|$|Craig Sheffer portrays Keith Scott, Dan's older, kinder, under-achieving brother. Sheffer {{said that}} {{characters}} like Keith {{are not the}} most enjoyable to play. [...] "Keith is a very simple character. I actually prefer more of a challenge. He wasn't a hugely interesting character. But {{he was a good}} guy and he was just a really genuine human being with good intentions", commented Sheffer. [...] "And that's a nice thing to play <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> {{at the end of the}} day. You don't bring too much with you. We had some good scenes within the framework of a simple character, so there was some of that stuff to play, but also a lot of cheesy stuff." [...] After Dan chose Deb rather than Karen, Keith helped Karen to raise Lucas and fell in love with her, but they only get together in season three. He had a recurring drinking problem and rivalry with his brother.|$|E
