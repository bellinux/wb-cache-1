The dog drags Ron through a tunnel under the Whomping Willow into the Shrieking Shack. Harry and Hermione follow, {{and there is a}} brief standoff when they find Ron with Sirius Black, who has transformed from the dog. Lupin enters, and they explain the situation to Harry and his friends: Lupin is a werewolf, which led to his friends James Potter, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew becoming animagi. Lupin explains that Scabbers is Pettigrew in his animal form; he has been hiding from Black, whom he had framed for the murders of Harry's parents and the thirteen Muggles.|$|E

[...] He also stated that he used to spar in the boxing gym after football training without his manager's knowledge, saying [...] "A few times at Sheffield United, Neil Warnock would drag me in and say ‘I hear you’ve been boxing’.

500|$|On October 11, 2011, several {{publications}} {{announced that}} Gaga was seen {{during the filming}} of the video in Snug Harbor Cultural Center. She was wearing a custom-made double zip lambskin jumpsuit by New York City designer, Asher Levine which was said {{to go along with}} the video's [...] "grungy" [...] and [...] "bloody" [...] theme and with the [...] "nod to New York downtown refinement." [...] Dancers and extras were spotted dressed in multiple looks: some as ballerinas and others in leopard print while Gaga's mother was also seen on stage. Later, other photos of the filming were published on several websites and they showed Gaga with blue lipstick and a leather romper with several male dancers, in a long-sleeve red dress with padded shoulders, a big satellite dish and <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>black</b> hat. Footage of the video was posted online on October 14, 2011. Gaga is seen dancing on the roof of a car as she sings the bridge from the song. She then slides down the car and begins running around the hood as the chorus starts. She's dressed in black, with a blond bob wig and black heels while rain is visible in the background, but she appears unfazed by the weather. During an interview with NDTV on October 31, Gaga revealed that she directed the video. She also worked with the director of photography Darius Khondji and art director Gideon Ponte.|$|E
2500|$|Storyboard artists Simon Duric said [...] "The {{security}} on the film was a challenge. That script was locked in a safe. Most of the time on a film you can sit at your desk {{with a copy of}} the script next to you. On this, you couldn’t. That’s fine but it was tricky in places. We had people flying drones over Pinewood studios trying to take photographs. It was nuts. If a prop was being moved we had to have them covered in <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>black</b> sheet.

2500|$|Following the {{box office}} under-performance of the 1985 Paramount/Amblin film Young Sherlock Holmes, Eisner decided to rename Basil of Baker Street into The Great Mouse Detective feeling the name [...] "Basil" [...] was [...] "too English". The re-titling of the film proved to be unpopular with the filmmakers so much that {{animator}} Ed Gombert wrote a satirical interoffice memo, allegedly by studio executive Peter Schneider, which gave preceding Disney films generic titles such as Seven Little Men Help a Girl, The Wonderful Elephant Who Could Really Fly, The Little Deer Who Grew Up, The Girl with the See-through Shoes, Two Dogs Fall in Love, Puppies Taken Away, and A Boy, a Bear and <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Black</b> Cat.

2500|$|The Reverend Octavius Pickard-Cambridge was {{the first}} to {{describe}} the Sydney funnel-web spider, from a female specimen housed in the British Museum in 1877. Establishing the genus Atrax, he named it Atrax robustus. The species name is derived from the Latin robustus [...] "strong/sturdy/mature". Some years later, William Joseph Rainbow described a male Sydney funnel-web as a new species—Euctimena tibialis—from a spider he found under a log in Turramurra, and another from Mosman. He coined the scientific name from the Ancient Greek euktimenos [...] "well built" [...] and Latin tibialis [...] "of the tibia", having noted its prominent tibial spur. In the same paper, he described a female Sydney funnel web as yet another species—Poikilomorpha montana—from a specimen collected from Jamison Valley and Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains. Its species name was derived from poikilomorphia [...] "variety of form" [...] referring to the eyes of different sizes, and montana [...] "of the mountains". In February 1927, a young boy died after being bitten on the hand after playing with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>black</b> spider on the laundry steps of his home in the Sydney suburb of Thornleigh. He fell gravely ill and perished later that evening. Public interest in spiders surged and the police brought the dead spider to the Australian Museum, which Anthony Musgrave [...] identified as Euctimena tibialis. He examined a series of male and female spiders collected around Sydney, and concluded that Euctimena tibialis was the male Atrax robustus due to anatomical similarities and after some males and females had been collected from the same locations.|$|E

Albini's touring schedule with Shellac {{did not allow}} time for the band to rehearse a full set, so they instead played a short set of four songs: [...] "Cables", [...] "Dead Billy", [...] "Pigeon Kill", and [...] "Racer-X". Albini explained that the performance was [...] "not about Big Black wanting to get back together or even an audience wanting to see Big Black, it's that ... to not honor Touch and Go would be an insult by way of damning with faint praise", describing the label as [...] " [...] just a benchmark for how a record label should behave, but how people should behave." [...] During the performance he stated that [...] "You can tell [...] not something we had a burning desire to do, but we did it because we love Touch and Go [...] we love Corey Rusk [...] When history talks about rock music it {{has a tendency to}} skip from the Sex Pistols to Nirvana, [...] something started in the 1980s and you're seeing the evidence of it all around you", remarking that the label was [...] "the best thing to happen to music in my lifetime, and we did this to say thanks". Though the band has been approached by promoters about doing other reunion shows, Albini has stated flatly [...] "that is definitely not going to happen." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{creation}} of the Uddeler- and Bleeke Lake(s): This myth concerns a battle that allegedly took place between Donar the God of Thunder with the winter giants and the [...] "Midgaardslang" [...] (a giant snake monster) who strategically align against him. The giants throw hail down, while the snake climbs into a tall oak tree and blows poison into the air. Donar attacks, riding through the air on [...] "his billy-goat wagon", the sky blazes and the earth trembles because of his [...] "never missing thunderhammer." [...] Donar strikes the snake on his head with such force on the head {{that not only was}} the monster crushed, the mighty thunderhammer went seven miles deep into the earth. The snake dies. However, in the attack the snake's poison scorches and stuns Donar. Donar crashes down, with his [...] "steerless goats" [...] and wagon onto the Donderberg (meaning Donar's hill or [...] "Thunder-hill") in Dieren. Then the earth sank into the sea, the seagod blew a horn and <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>black</b> ship came to collect Donar's body. When the floodwaters receded, two lakes mark the spot that are [...] "as deep as the world, the Uddelermeer or [...] "Lake of Uddel" [...] (Uttiloch), and the Godenmeer (God's lake)..." [...] Later the legend continues that Thor's hammer surfaced from the depths. The grave of Migdaardsnake became overgrown with the forest nearby, until in 1222 a bright flame shot out of the pool and the ghost of the snake wriggled up and fled north. The forest was burned and a moor near the lake remains where the forest once was.|$|E
