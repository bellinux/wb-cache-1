40|$|Abstract. Existing bank-card payment systems, such as EMV, {{have two}} serious vulnerabilities: the user {{does not have}} a {{trustworthy}} interface, and the protocols are vulnerable {{in a number of ways}} to man-in-themiddle attacks. Moving to RFID payments may, on the one hand, let bank customers use their mobile phones to make payments, which will go a fair way towards fixing the interface problem; on the other hand, protocol vulnerabilities may become worse. By 2011 the NFC vendors hope there will be 500, 000, 000 NFC-enabled mobile phones in the world. If these devices can act as cards or terminals, can be programmed by their users, and can communicate with each other, then they will provide a platform for deploying all manner of protocol attacks. Designing the security protocols to mitigate such attacks may be difficult. First, it will include most of the hot topics of IT policy over the last ten years (from key escrow through DRM to platform trust and <b>accessory</b> <b>control)</b> as subproblems. Second, the incentives may lead the many players to try to dump the liability on each other, leading to overall system security that is equivalent to the weakest link rather than to sum-of-efforts and is thus suboptimal. ...|$|E

O exercício produz calor e com o aumento da temperatura muscular o processo termorregulador fará com que a temperatura da superfície {{corporal}} se modifique mesmo em natação. O objetivo deste estudo foi analisar as variações da temperatura cutânea de nadadores durante esforços incrementais. Participaram voluntariamente 12 nadadores (8 mas/ 4 fem), com experiências nacionais e internacionais, média de idade de 15, 7 anos e índice médioFINA de 562 pontos. Após 15 m de aquecimento, os atletasforam submetidos a dez repetições de 100 metros na técnica do nado crawl, divididos em quatro cargas incrementais com base no cálculo do percentual individual de melhor desempenho. Após o aquecimento e repetições, os sujeitos secos, foramtermografados com um termógrafo digital (ThermaCAM® E 320 Flir). As temperaturas cutâneas médias foram determinadas em diferentes áreas corporais de interesse, localizadas nos braços, antebraços e tronco, nas porções anterior e posterior, em modelo baseado no proposto por Zaidi et al. (2007). Como medida de controle acessória foi coletada amostras de sangue para determinação da concentração de lactato sanguíneo. As variações de temperaturas das diferentes regiões foram analisadas em cada incremento de velocidade, pelo teste da ANOVA Oneway (Tukey). Verificou-se a ocorrência de diferenças estatisticamente significantes (p Abstract : The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze variations in skin temperature during incremental swim test. The exercise produces heat and the muscle temperature increase and skin temperature will be modified by thermoregulatory process, even in swimming. Voluntarily participated in the study 12 experienced swimmers (8 male/ 4 female), with a mean age of 15. 7 years and average index of 562 FINA points. The athletes were submitted at incremental effort set (3 x 3 x 100 + 1 x 100) in front crawl technique, based on the percentage of individual best performance. As an <b>accessory</b> <b>control</b> measure blood samples were collected for determination of the blood lactate concentration. The thermography was taken after warm up and in programed repetitions by a digital thermal imager camera (ThermaCAM® E 320 Flir). Was determined the average skin temperatures in different body areas of interest located in the following regions: arms, forearms and torso, both the anterior and posterior view, on a model based on Zaidi et al. (2007) propose. The temperature variations of the different regions were analyzed for each speed increment. Similarly, the thermal asymmetries have been checked against the effort of each load and the respective athlete laterality. After analyzing the results, using the test Oneway ANOVA (Tukey), there was the occurrence of statistically significant differences (p < 0. 01) between the studied regions. The application of the t test also showed a significant difference (p = 0. 009) between the both sides of the pectoral region. From these results it was concluded that higher temperatures were set related to intermediate load at 80 % speed, suggesting the input of the thermoregulatory mechanism...|$|E
