5|$|At {{the maiden}} voyage of the Springfield monorail, Lanley {{arranges}} for a well-attended opening ceremony, which will divert the town's attention while he escapes {{on a plane}} to Tahiti. The whole town turns out, and Leonard Nimoy is the guest of honor. The monorail departs just before Marge and Cobb arrive. Although it runs normally at the start, the controls soon malfunction and immediately begins to over-speed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>track,</b> leaving Homer, Bart, and the passengers in danger, as the monorail's electricity cannot be shut off due to it being solar powered.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{terrorist}} attacks in Paris on the Friday evening of the race weekend, Formula One decided to honour the victims with all drivers wearing black armbands during the parade lap on race day as well as the French tricolore being displayed on the truck that took the drivers <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> French driver Romain Grosjean had already worn an armband with the flag of his country during Saturday's sessions. However, a long planned minute of silence for the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims was upheld and plans to dedicate the salute to the Paris attacks discarded.|$|E
5|$|Next, {{the train}} passes through two {{consecutive}} horseshoe turns, {{first to the}} right and then to the left. As the name suggests, Horseshoe turns are highly banked horseshoe-shaped turns which feature track entering from roughly the same direction as where it exits. As the train exits the second horseshoe, it swoops down and begins a 270-degree helix to the right, which leads into the ride's second inversion, an inline twist. The inline twist sees riders perform a full rotation <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>track,</b> starting from a position where they are facing downward. After completing the twist, the train reaches the brake run and a final right-hand turn that leads back into the station.|$|E

5|$|The {{meeting at}} Aintree had been beset by {{problems}} before the race. Fifteen animal rights protesters invaded the course near the first fence (as had also {{happened at the}} 1991 Grand National) resulting in a delayed start. A first false start was caused by several riders becoming tangled in the starting tape. Starter Keith Brown, who was officiating his last National before retirement, waved his red recall flag and a second official, Ken Evans, who was situated 100 yards further down the track, in turn signalled to the leading runners to turn around. At the second attempt, the tape became tangled again — {{around the neck of}} jockey Richard Dunwoody — and Brown called another false start. However, this time his recall flag did not unfurl as he waved it. As a result, 30 of the 39 riders set off <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>track,</b> oblivious to the recall.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} league {{championship}} in 1899, Villa's record-breaking average crowd of 21,000 allowed {{the club to}} invest in a two-stage ground improvement programme. The first stage extended the terrace covering on the Trinity Road side at the cost of £887; the second cost £1,300 and involved re-laying all terracing <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> to remedy a design flaw that caused poor sightlines {{for the majority of the}} crowd. In 1911, Villa bought the freehold of the ground for £8,250, the office buildings in the old aquarium and car park area for £1,500 and the carriage drive and bowling green for £2,000. This was the first stage in plans drawn up by Villa director Frederick Rinder that saw the capacity of Villa Park increased to 104,000. In June 1914, another phase of enhancements began at Villa Park to compete with improvements at other grounds around the country, including Everton's Goodison Park, where a new two-tiered stand had just been completed. The first stage of improvements saw the cycling track removed, new banking at the Holte Hotel End (Holte End), and a re-profiling of all the terracing to bring it closer to the newly squared-off pitch. Rinder turned to the renowned architect Archibald Leitch to design a new Villa Park. Their joint plans included large banked end stands at the Holte and Witton ends and the incorporation of the original Victorian Lower Grounds buildings, including the aquarium and the newly acquired bowling greens. The outbreak of the First World War severely hampered design and construction efforts.|$|E

However, it disappointed the team by only managing fifth {{place on the}} Power Board (currently 16th), an unexpectedly low position ultimately attributed to the car's kerb weight of , {{more than any of}} the four faster cars. In Series 15 Episode 5 however, the Stig took the 1,200 PS Super Sport version <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> in 1:16.8, thus setting a new lap record.|$|E

25|$|There {{are some}} {{additional}} maintenance {{costs associated with}} the electrical equipment <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>track,</b> such as power sub-stations and the catenary wire itself, but, if there is sufficient traffic, the reduced track and especially the lower engine maintenance and running costs exceed the costs of this maintenance significantly.|$|E

25|$|Born in Vinnytsia, Krevsun grew up <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> as {{her family}} was heavily {{involved}} in sports; her mother Militina Moskvina was an 800m runner while her father, Yuriy Gurtovenko, was a talented shooter. Initially starting out as a 10 kilometres athlete, she switched to the 800m in 1997. The family lived in poverty, affecting her athletics career, but she was invited to attend the Donetsk Sport College in 1998 and met Serhiy Krevsun, an amateur boxer, whom she would later marry.|$|E
25|$|During {{construction}} of a level crossing at Smørstein on 17 August 1918 the area <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> started experiencing a series of landslides. Within a few days the earthwork under the tracks had slid away. NSB hired a steamship to freight passengers and cargo past the effected area, {{and part of the}} traffic was freighted across the fjord from Horten to Moss. A temporary line was built close to the mountain, while construction took place of a temporary solution, the Smørstein Tunnel. The temporary line opened on 28 October 1918 and the new segment with a tunnel on 25 May 1921.|$|E

50|$|Methods {{to reduce}} the number of rail-related suicides include CCTV {{surveillance}} of stretches where suicides frequently occur, often with direct links to the local police or surveillance companies.

Trees and bushes are cut down <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> in order to increase driver visibility.|$|R
