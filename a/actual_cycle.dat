[...] This is due to 30 mm titanium intake valves, modified camshafts and 48 mm throttle bodies. For 2009 MV Agusta crossed the F4 1000R 312 with the 1,078cc F4CC to make the F4 1078RR 312 that made [...] Then in 2010 they released the final year for the 312 the limited edition F4 1078 RR 312 Edizione finale. The [...] "312" [...] in the name refers to the bike's claimed top speed of 312 km/h (193.868 mph). Italy's Motociclismo magazine verified MV Agusta's claim, achieving a top speed of 193.24 mph at the Nardò Ring. Though reviewed by multiple other sources there is no source outside of Italy to even come close to this speed. Only the Italian manufacture and this one Italian magazine have stated this speed as <b>actual.</b> <b>Cycle</b> World when referencing the speed just state alleged speed. Sport Rider did a in depth review with the F4 1000R 312 and the brother the $120,000 1,078cc F4CC; at the eight-mile oval at the Honda Proving Center of California with perfect conditions with cool temperatures and no wind, they did a number of runs and experimented with body positioning for aerodynamics and were only able to achieve a top speed of 185.4 mph. They also stated that {{to make up for the}} 8 mph shortfall a significant horsepower increase was needed. The 1,078cc F4CC that has more horsepower 14 hp more, @ 12,500 rpm (rear wheel) was only able to achieve a 189.1 mph top speed.|$|E

40|$|A Vuilleumier (VM) cycle {{heat pump}} is a closed gas cycle driven by heat energy. It {{has the highest}} {{performance}} among all known heat driven technologies. In this paper, two thermodynamic analyses, including energy and exergy analysis, are carried out to evaluate {{the application of a}} VM cycle heat pump for waste heat utilization. For a prototype VM cycle heat pump, equations for theoretical and actual cycles are established. Under the given conditions, the exergy efficiency for the theoretical cycle is 0. 23 compared to 0. 15 for the <b>actual</b> <b>cycle.</b> This is due to losses taking place in the <b>actual</b> <b>cycle.</b> Reheat losses and flow friction losses account for almost 83 % of the total losses. Investigation of the effect of heat source temperature, cycle pressure and speed on the exergy efficiency indicate that the low temperature waste heat is a suitable heat source for a VM cycle heat pump. The selected cycle pressure should be higher than 100 MPa, and 200 – 300 rpm is the optimum speed...|$|E
40|$|The memory {{hierarchy}} {{is often a}} critical component of an embedded system. An embedded system’s {{memory hierarchy}} can have dramatic impact on the overall cost, performance, and power consumption of the system. Consequently, designers spend considerable time evaluating potential memory system designs. Unfortunately, the range of options in the memory hierarchy (e. g., number, size, and type of caches, on-chip SRAM, DRAM, EPROM, etc.) makes thorough exploration of the design space using typical simulation techniques infeasible. This paper describes a fast, accurate technique to estimate an application’s average memory latency on a set of memory hierarchies. The technique is fast—two orders of magnitude faster than a full simulation. It is also accurate—extensive measurements show that 70 % of the estimates were within 1 percentage point of the <b>actual</b> <b>cycle</b> count while over 99 % of all estimates were within 10 percentage points of the <b>actual</b> <b>cycle</b> count. This fast, accurate technique provides the embedded system designer the ability to more fully explore the design space of potential memory hierarchies and select the one that best meets the system’s design requirements...|$|E

Using acoustical transducers and related instrumentation that set low limits (0-50,000 Hz with roll-off) causes errors. The low roll-off during measurement of actual frequency of acoustic cycles results in miscalculation due to <b>actual</b> hydraulic <b>cycles</b> in the possible ranges of 1-1000 MHz or higher.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the {{predictive}} capability of three methods of truck cycle time estimation in open-pit mining: computer simulation, artificial neural networks (NNs), and multiple regressions (MRs). The aim is to determine the best method. The most common method currently used is computer simulation. Design/methodology/approach – Truck cycle times at a large open pit mine are estimated using computer simulation, artificial NNs, and MRs. The estimated cycle times by each method are in turn compared to the <b>actual</b> <b>cycle</b> times recorded by a computerized mine monitoring system at the same mine. The errors associated with each method relative to the <b>actual</b> <b>cycle</b> times are documented and form the basis for comparing the three methods. Findings – The paper clearly indicates that computer simulation methods used in predicting truck cycle times in open-pit mining underestimate and overestimate the results for short and long hauls, respectively. It appears that both NN and regression models are superior in their predictive abilities compared to computer simulations. Research limitations/implications – The cycle time prediction models developed apply to a specific mine site and one has to be careful not to directly apply these models to other operations. Practical implications – The paper describes the implementation of regression and NN modelling. An opportunity exists for mines to utilise the large volumes of data generated to predict truck haulage cycle times more accurately and hence, improve the quality of mine planning. Originality/value – The paper addresses an area of need in the mining industry. Accurate prediction of cycle times is critical to mine planners as it impacts on production targets and hence, the budgets. Emmanuel K. Chanda, Steven Gardine...|$|E
40|$|Although we have {{reliable}} data {{of solar}} polar fields {{only from the}} mid- 1970 s, {{it seems that the}} polar field at a minimum is well correlated with the next cycle, but the strength of the cycle is not correlated with the polar field produced at its end. We explain this by suggesting that the Babcock–Leighton mechanism of poloidal field generation from tilted active regions involves randomness, whereas the other aspects of the dynamo process are more ordered. To model <b>actual</b> <b>cycles,</b> we have to 'correct' our theoretical dynamo model by 'feeding' information about the polar field at the minima. Following this process, we find that our model fits the observed sunspot numbers of cycles 21 – 23 reasonably well and predicts that cycle 24 will be the weakest in a century...|$|R

30|$|This method detects and fixes cycle slip on a satellite-wise, {{real-time}} basis. The cycle slip {{detection and}} fix for each satellite is completely independent {{and does not}} rely on the information of any other satellites. The success of this method heavily relies {{on the use of}} the ionospheric physical property: TECR not exceeding the specified TECR threshold. Taking advantage of this property, cycle slip detection and fix is still successful even if all the GNSS satellites of a given epoch simultaneously experience arbitrarily large SIPE and any kind of cycle slips in the carrier phase data. The only disadvantage of the current method is that the parameter SIPEmax needs to be specified in advance before <b>actual</b> <b>cycle</b> slip detection and fix. Thus a sufficiently large value has to be defined to prepare for the worst situation. This might unnecessarily increase computational burden.|$|E

Agglomerated multigrid convergence rates are presented using a range of two- and three-dimensional randomly perturbed unstructured grids for simple geometries with isotropic and highly stretched grids. Two agglomeration techniques are used within an overall topology-preserving agglomeration framework.

Multigrid with a Galerkin coarse-grid discretization using piecewise-constant prolongation and a heuristic correction factor is slower and also grid-dependent.
