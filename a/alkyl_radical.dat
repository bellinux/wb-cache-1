40|$|The novel profluorescent nitroxide, 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethyldibenzo[e,g]isoindolin- 2 -yloxyl (TMDBIO) was {{investigated}} as a probe {{for the formation}} of polymer <b>alkyl</b> <b>radicals</b> during the thermo-oxidative degradation of unstabilised polypropylene. TMDBIO possesses a very low fluorescence quantum yield due to quenching by the nitroxide group; however, when the free-radical moiety is removed by reaction with <b>alkyl</b> <b>radicals</b> (to give an alkoxyainine), strong fluorescence is observed. Using spectrofluorimetry, the reaction of the nitroxide with polymer <b>alkyl</b> <b>radicals</b> during oxidation has been monitored. Significantly, the trapping of polymer <b>alkyl</b> <b>radicals</b> during the "induction period" at 120 degrees C is observed, when {{it is not possible to}} detect changes in the polymer using either chemiluminescence or infrared spectroscopy. This highlights the sensitivity of this method and represents the direct observation of free-radical generation in polypropylene in the "induction period". TMDBIO also successfully stabilises polypropylene under thermo-oxidative conditions, which is consistent with its action as a radical trap. At elevated temperatures (150 degrees C), at the end of the "induction period" when the polymer is extensively degraded, the fluorescence decreases, due to secondary oxidation of the TMDBIO.
