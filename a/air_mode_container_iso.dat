50|$|As a consequence, {{swap bodies}} {{do not have}} upper corner fittings, are not stackable, and must be lifted by the bottom frame, unlike the more {{widespread}} shipping <b>containers</b> (<b>ISO</b> <b>containers).</b> This makes them unsuitable for ship-based overseas transportation. Because they are not stackable and are lifted by the bottom corners, they require special handling when transported by rail. Due to security concerns, {{an increasing number of}} swap bodies have a hard surface instead of curtains and tarpaulins.|$|R
25|$|An {{intermodal}} container {{is a large}} standardized shipping container, designed and built for intermodal freight transport, meaning these containers can be used across different modes of transport – from ship to rail to truck – without unloading and reloading their cargo. Intermodal containers are primarily used to store and transport materials and products efficiently and securely in the global containerized intermodal freight transport system, but smaller numbers are in regional use as well. These containers are known under a number of names, such as simply container, cargo or freight <b>container,</b> <b>ISO</b> <b>container,</b> shipping, sea or ocean container, container van or (Conex) box, sea or c can.|$|R

2500|$|Containerization is {{a system}} of {{intermodal}} freight transport using intermodal containers (also called shipping <b>containers</b> and <b>ISO</b> <b>containers).</b> The containers have standardized dimensions.

The handling system is completely mechanized so that all handling is done with cranes [...] and special forklift trucks. [...] All containers are numbered and tracked using computerized systems.|$|R
