5|$|It is Christmas, and Christine {{is having}} dinner with Marion, Ernie, Fung, Bobby and Adam. Christine unwraps her present to find an album of photos from her life. She says that she feels as if her life is {{flashing}} before her eyes, and then realises what is happening. Christine sits in <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>wreck</b> as emergency services attempt to free her. On the front seat & window screen, there are broken eggs from a shopping bag and the Stranger is explaining to the police that {{he stepped into the}} road causing the crash, and, though he could free Jack he could not reach Christine. At the dinner table, Jack enters dressed as a Nativity angel. Marion says it is time for Christine to move on. Christine says a final goodbye.|$|E
25|$|Governor Jon Corzine {{was nearly}} killed in <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>wreck</b> on the Garden State Parkway in Galloway Township in 2007, {{as he was}} {{traveling}} to a meeting between a Rutgers sports team and radio personality Don Imus. Imus had infamously called the Rutgers University women's basketball team nappy-headed hos, leading to his firing by two communications networks. Imus met with the team at Drumthwacket to apologize, and Governor Corzine attempted to arrive at that meeting from Atlantic City, reaching speeds of at least 91mph (146km/h), without wearing a seatbelt. His chauffeur, a New Jersey State Police officer, {{lost control of the}} vehicle, seriously injuring the Governor and leading to a new period of acting governorship by Richard Codey while Corzine recuperated.|$|E
25|$|From {{one of his}} {{experiments}} emerged the Cyber Series – artificial humanoids possessing superhuman {{strength and}} agility. But something was amiss: The 5000 original Cybers, engineered {{to be the perfect}} servants, mimicked human emotions too closely, displaying free will of their own. When they disobey orders from Reichter, he orders all of the Cyber Series to be destroyed. After Cyber-29 died falling from a cliff, Reichter transfers his brain into the body of a panther and names him Data-7. Cyber-6 was the only true Cyber to survive the massacre, escaping {{with the help of a}} black slave who hid her away in a fishing village. When Reichter interrogates to kill the slave, Cybersix arrives at the city of Meridiana, where she battles Reichter and his minions, and disguises herself as fellow teacher Adrian Seidelman after the real one is killed in <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>wreck.</b>|$|E

5000|$|... 2016: The {{race was}} started 20 minutes early {{due to the}} threat of rain in the area. After a 50 lap opening green flag run, the race itself was marred by eight crashes, {{including}} four Big Ones. Of the 40 cars in the field, only seven cars finished without damage. These included a wreck on lap 96 that saw Chris Buescher flip over three times on the back straightaway, <b>a</b> 17 <b>car</b> <b>wreck</b> in turn 1 on lap 162, and <b>a</b> 12 <b>car</b> <b>wreck</b> on lap 180 saw Matt Kenseth flip over on the back straightaway and strike the inside wall, before turning back upright.

25|$|Fully {{aware of}} the dangers of his condition, Vysotsky made several {{attempts}} to cure himself of his addiction. He underwent an experimental (and ultimately discredited) blood purification procedure offered by a leading drug rehabilitation specialist in Moscow. He also went to an isolated retreat in France with his wife Marina in the spring of 1980 as a way of forcefully depriving himself of any access to drugs. After these attempts failed, Vysotsky returned to Moscow to find his life in an increasingly stressful state of disarray. He had been a defendant in two criminal trials, one for <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>wreck</b> he had caused some months earlier, and one for an alleged conspiracy to sell unauthorized concert tickets (he eventually received a suspended sentence and a probation in the first case, and the charges in the second were dismissed, although several of his co-defendants were found guilty). He also unsuccessfully fought the film studio authorities for the rights to direct a movie called The Green Phaeton. Relations with his wife Marina were deteriorating, and he was torn between his loyalty to her and his love for his mistress Oksana Afanasyeva. He had also developed a severe inflammation in one of his legs, making his concert performances extremely challenging.|$|E

500|$|Wanderone {{was known}} for ostentation, self-aggrandizement, tall tales, fast-talk, and {{entertaining}} banter. He was even publicly recognized by famed boaster Muhammad Ali as better at boasting. His critical biographer, R.A. Dyer, documents that Wanderone completely fabricated a [...] "here-by-fate" [...] tale about <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>wreck</b> which brought the player to Little Egypt; it was a tale that Wanderone encouraged to spread and further embellished in his autobiography, to lend an air of the mystical to his public persona. He made false claims about beating Willie Mosconi so frequently that Mosconi filed a slander lawsuit, to little avail.|$|E
500|$|Writer Mary D. Dutta {{believed}} that OLTL, {{in order to}} [...] "assuage the moral qualms associated with a sympathetic rapist", added [...] "mitigating reasons for Todd's sexual abuse of Marty"; namely, that he was raped {{at the age of}} fourteen by his adoptive father, Peter Manning, though {{whether or not he was}} raped is disputed. Dutta feels that the gang rape storyline invokes many of the rape myths that have appeared in literature since the 18th century, which includes [...] "only bad girls get raped," [...] "women ask for it," [...] and [...] "women 'cry rape' only when they've been jilted or have something to cover up". Dutta also includes the myth of the [...] "reformed rake", or [...] "the rapist redeemed by the woman who loves him, not uncommonly the same woman he raped", which [...] "deny or reduce perceived injury, or... blame the victims for their own victimization". Dutta states, [...] "Todd's redemption begins with his rescue of Marty and two children from <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>wreck</b> and ends with the discovery that he is the rightful heir to a huge fortune." ...|$|E
2500|$|Todd {{eventually}} {{tries to}} rape Marty again but fails; his attack is thwarted by Marty's close friend (Luna Moody). The writers had the scuffle {{between the two}} leave Todd with a scar gracing {{the right side of}} his face, which served to signify his past misdeeds. They soon started to redeem him, first with the introduction of character Rebecca Lewis. His [...] "true redemption" [...] begins with his rescue of Marty and two children from <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>wreck,</b> and ends with the discovery that he is the rightful heir to a fortune left by his deceased biological father.|$|E

She reclaims the shares of Fusion she gave to Babe Carey, a former foe of Kendall's, and eventually forces {{her out of the}} company. Babe had secured an important music deal with Zarf, and Greenlee is forced to rehire her, much to the delight of Ryan's new wife Annie Lavery and their friends Di Henry, Amanda Dillon and Kendall herself, who lauded Babe's achievements at Fusion in Grennlee's absence. Going against the rest of the women at Fusion, she supports Ava Benton as the [...] "face of Fusion", and under her return profits skyrocket. She also learns that Kendall's new husband Zach Slater was responsible for a power outage the left her eggs not viable for implantation, and decides to sue for custody of the resulting child, Spike.

2500|$|The varsity {{football}} {{program at the}} University of Arizona began in 1899, though the Wildcats nickname was not adopted until later. Stuart Forbes became the first head coach of Arizona football history and the team compiled a 1–1–1 record. From 1900 to 1901, William W. Skinner served as head football coach at the University of Arizona. While there, he also studied geology. He guided Arizona to 3–1 and 4–1 records, respectively. On November 7, 1914, the team traveled {{to the west coast}} to play Occidental, then one of the reigning gridiron powers in California. Occidental won 14–0. Arizona later received the name [...] "Wildcats" [...] after a Los Angeles Times correspondent, Bill Henry, wrote that [...] "The Arizona men showed the fight of wildcats". Pop McKale was a very successful high school coach in the Tucson area when he was hired at UA. In 1921, Drop-kicker/receiver Harold [...] "Nosey" [...] McClellan led the nation in scoring with 124 points. Wildcats finished the regular season 7–1, and were invited to UA's first bowl game, the East-West Christmas Classic in San Diego, to play powerhouse Centre College of Kentucky; Arizona lost the game 38–0. The Wildcats did not compete in football in 1918 due to World War I. On October 18, 1926, UA quarterback and student body president John [...] "Button" [...] Salmon died from injuries sustained in <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>wreck.</b> His final words, spoken to coach [...] "Pop" [...] McKale, were: [...] "Tell them.....tell the team to Bear Down."

They won their first game against Caltech with a shutout score of 25–0. McKale retired after sixteen seasons at Arizona.

30|$|A {{high level}} of {{employer}} organization and strong unions, especially in manufacturing, combined with pattern bargaining allowed Germany in the 1970 s and 1980 s to emulate {{the high degree of}} wage bargaining coordination found in Scandinavia during these years. With IG Metall as pacesetter, “other industries settled wage increases within 1 percent of the engineering agreement.” (Jacobi et al. 1992 : 248).“This model has survived the turbulence of German reunification and declining rates of organization in manufacturing, both on the employers’ and unions’ side. Still, IG Metall is very powerful and acts as the pace-setter, for instance in the initial phase of the recession when it negotiated a ‘shorter working hours’ schedule and, in direct contact with the government, <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>wrecking</b> subsidy scheme.|$|R
