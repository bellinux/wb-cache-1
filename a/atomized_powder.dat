It added reduced iron powder and <b>atomized</b> <b>powder</b> manufacturing in 1978, then segregation-free iron powder in 1989. In 1989, it entered into a limit partnership with United States steel company Armco. The company was renamed AK Steel Holding in 1993 when it became publicly traded. In 2000, the price war resulting from the so-called Ghosn Shock impacted the business performance of steel manufacturers such as Kawasaki Steel. During the resulting credit crisis, NKK and Kawasaki Steel decided to merge their businesses in April 2001. This merger was completed in September 2002, forming JFE Holdings.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the rheological properties of SS 316 L water atomized MIM feedstock. Coarse and fine SS 316 L water <b>atomized</b> <b>powder</b> {{is mixed with}} a composite binder consisting of PMMA and PEG to form a homogenous paste, termed as feedstock. The feedstock is loaded with SS 316 L water <b>atomized</b> <b>powder</b> ranging 62 v/o, 62. 5 v/o, 63 v/o, 63. 5 v/o and 64 v/o. However, due to the morphology of the water <b>atomized</b> <b>powder</b> which is not spherical compared to the gas atomized ones, fine powder feedstock is unable to produce any significant rheological result due to the powder loading being more than 63. 5 v/o. Results show that the fine powder feedstock demonstrates a higher viscosity if compared to the coarse powder feedstock. It can be established that binder separations are {{likely to occur in}} the coarse powder feedstock, especially, at high temperatures.

40|$|Abstract. High {{chromium}} {{cast iron}} alloys {{are widely used}} to produce wear resistant components. However, formation of the large carbides restricts their applied range for the components by traditional solidification techniques. The gas atomization is an effective approach to refine their structures, improve their properties and extend their application field. Based {{on the study of}} structure evolution of <b>atomized</b> <b>powders</b> of Fe- 25 Cr- 3. 9 C alloy, this paper investigated the structure evolution of the <b>atomized</b> <b>powders</b> of Fe- 25 Cr- 3. 9 C alloy with addition of Ni and B elements. It is found that addition of Ni and B elements make more primary lath-shaped phase be formed. As particle size decrease, width of the primary lath-shaped phase gradually decreases, and the structures are all composed of lath-shaped phase in the small powders with diameter less than 38 µm.

40|$|A {{series of}} 420 {{stainless}} steel samples produced using the M-flex system (a powder-based 3 D printer) {{were used to}} study the systematic evolution {{of the changes in}} porosity and pore size behavior after sintering. Powders produced from gas atomization and water atomization have been used to prepare green coupons. The major goals of this work were to; 1) study the optimum sintering processing parameters in terms of temperature and holding time to access the level of densification, 2) develop {{a better understanding of the}} relationship between powder characteristics, density, porosity and sintering parameters, 3) investigate the sintering behavior of powders of the same chemical composition but different particle size and distribution. The microstructural characterization for both gas- and water-atomized powder has been done with the aid of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and fractal dimension analysis. Different sintering conditions, i. e. temperature and holding time, were examined. The coupon samples were encapsulated in a vacuum quartz tube to avoid oxidation. Shrinkage is measured after sintering, based on which density and porosity are calculated for each sample. Optical Microscope (OM) has been used to observe the microstructure change in the central part of each sample. The powder characterization results point out that water <b>atomized</b> <b>powder</b> has a more irregular and complex shape compared to gas <b>atomized</b> <b>powder.</b> Thus it is predicted to have better sintering behavior. The sintering results show that water <b>atomized</b> <b>powder</b> is easier to sinter and can get lower porosity at the same sintering condition compared to the gas <b>atomized</b> <b>powder.</b> However, full densification was not observed under the experimental conditions used in this study.

The microstructure of a wide size range of <b>atomized</b> <b>powders</b> invariably revealed cellular and dendritic morphology.

The <b>atomized</b> <b>powder</b> contained a large volume fraction of intermetallic phases located predominantly in continuous layers separating cells or dendrites {{in the interior of}} individual powder particles.

High energy milling destroyed most intermetallic particles and enriched the matrix by solute atoms. The high deformation energy introduced into the powder during milling enhanced microhardness up to 220 HV.

The nanostructured powder was produced by cryomilling an <b>atomized</b> <b>powder,</b> using a ball-to-powder ratio of 30 : 1 for 8 h; it has a mean grain size of 19 ± 2 nm and shows quite a high thermal stability, as shown by a DSC investigation. The influence of temperature, particle size, pressure on the densification and sintering mechanisms {{as well as that of}} heating rate and holding time on the structural evolution has been investigated. Particle rearrangement, local deformation, bulk deformation and sintering are the SPS mechanisms occurring successively during the sintering process of the atomized copper.

Based on product’s final requirements, optional secondary operations are performed. PM components for automotive application are experiencing a growth coupled with new challenges.   PM´s capability for producing complex net shaped components with desired properties has enabled it to be an alternative to other traditional manufacturing processes. Average U. S. made vehicle in 2010 contained an estimated 41. 6 pounds of PM parts and in Europe, the average per vehicle PM parts in 2010 is estimated 18. 5 pounds [3].   New design goals set by OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) demands for complex shaped components with high mechanical properties. Stupendous developments are done in the field of PM component manufacturing and PM raw material manufacturing, endeavoring to cater the technical and economic needs set by OEMs. Based on the application, unique powder characteristics are demanded which are in turn associated with the quality of powders produced.  Powder production for conventional PM application encompasses reduction or atomization followed by annealing. Reduced powders are called sponge iron powders, used for low density (density of PM component) application and <b>atomized</b> <b>powders</b> are used for relatively high density application.

These studies involved LaNi{sub 5 } substituted alloys which were prepared using conventional cast and crush alloying techniques. While valuable {{to the understanding of}} metal hydride effects, the previous work nearly ignored the potential for alternative direct powder production methods, like high pressure gas atomization (HPGA).

Concurrently, development of a gas atomization nozzle that is more efficient than all current designs is needed to increase the yield of ultrafine AB{sub 5 } alloy powder for further processing advantage. Gas atomization processing of the AB{sub 5 } alloys was demonstrated to be effective in producing ultrafine spherical powders that were resilient to hydrogen cycling for the benefit of improving corrosion resistance in battery application. These ultrafine powders benefited from the rapid solidification process by having refined solute segregation in the microstructure of the gas <b>atomized</b> <b>powders</b> which enabled a rapid anneal treatment of the powders.
