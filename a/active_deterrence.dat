40|$|UK {{aerodromes}} suffer consistently wet {{conditions that}} often result in standing water on airfield grassland or {{a requirement for}} water run-off and containment facilities. Such areas routinely present an attraction to hazardous birds including ducks, geese, waders and swans. Where possible, such features are eliminated from the aerodrome environment {{at the design stage}} or through the implementation of additional drainage. Practicalities and expense, however, can limit these options. This paper discusses the types of design features that are used to reduce the attraction of a wetland site to birds, and reports on the effectiveness of wiring, netting and bird balls as control systems for existing sites. Wire spacing needed to be reduced to 0. 7 m intervals before a significant reduction in total bird numbers was achieved. 20 m spacing, however, was effective against swans. Netting, or wire spacing at less than 0. 3 m was required to exclude all hazardous birds. Bird balls excluded all species but were not suitable for all sites. Continuous <b>active</b> <b>deterrence</b> patrols were successful at preventing the use of, but not investigation of, saturated wetland sites that developed during heavy rains on some airfields...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} America's strategic {{policy for}} the Indian Ocean area from 1970 to 1980 and assesses the efficacy of its contribution to the US security objectives there of upholding friendly, primarily Persian Gulf states' security and stability, maintaining access to oil, ensuring the safety of shipping and limiting Soviet influence. Minor intermittent naval display succeeded in balancing the Soviet naval presence, {{the main purpose of}} American policy until 1979, because that presence was too small to exercise significant influence. The littoral states, however, were ambivalent: they wanted the US to balance the USSR but feared a potential super-power naval arms race. Naval display failed as part of America's indirect threat in 1973 - 74 to retaliate against friendly Gulf Arab states if they continued the oil embargo caused by the October 1973 Middle East war. America modified its strategic policy when Gulf security became more precarious after the Iranian revolution in early 1979. It intensified its naval display and began to approximate a land force presence in South-West Asia in order to show greater concern for its interests, to reassure friends about its reliability as a security actor and to enhance the political and military balance against the Soviets. The US emphasized more direct and <b>active</b> <b>deterrence</b> against a potential Soviet or Iraqi attack and preparation for intervention, if necessary, within a friendly Gulf state in order to protect access to oil. America's modified policy gave some reassurance to friendly Gulf states that shipping would be safe, that, available in the background and if requested in a crisis, its armed forces would help them to cope with likely external threats and that the US was more determined to counter the USSR. But America was also perceived to be a political and potential interventionist danger to friendly countries and to be of uncertain reliability in the event of "worst case" Soviet or Iraqi aggression because its immediately available combat capability was weak. The US armed forces were unnecessary and virtually inappropriate for helping friendly regimes to maintain domestic stability or for preserving access to oil. America's strategic policy was of little relevance for limiting the USSR's improvement of its political and strategic position in South-West Asia in the late 1970 s, and more direct and active US deterrence reinforced marginally at most the Soviet intention not to attack into the Persian Gulf...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{show how}} bird {{behaviour}} {{can be used to}} guide best practice bird management plans for landfill sites. Bird hazards at landfill sites represent {{one of the most significant}} yet predominantly controllable off-airfield concerns for flight safety. ICAO standards provide airport operators with the opportunity to attempt to eliminate such hazards from the environment surrounding their aerodrome. Bird numbers were recorded at five landfill sites with <b>active</b> integrated <b>deterrence</b> regimes in place and at a landfill site with bird exclusion netting. Both netting and integrated strategies delivered highly effective levels of control although breakdown frequencies and amounts varied. Behavioural observations of birds showed that active systems can be significantly improved by ensuring dawn to dusk, seven day a week deterrence is implemented and that netting systems can be improved by ensuring adequate maintenance and back-up control is specified within management plans. Irregular failures in control do not generally result in birds utilising a site. Nevertheless, failures should be rectified immediately if birds are noted around a site or within 3 hours if not. Gulls required only 20 minutes of cumulative foraging time on a landfill site to meet their daily energy requirements. Spo...|$|R
40|$|We {{presented}} {{subjects with}} pairs of hypothetical scenarios. The action in each scenario harmed {{some people in}} order to aid others. In {{one member of the}} pair, the harm was {{a direct result of the}} action. In the other member, it was an indirect byproduct. Subjects preferred the indirect harm to the direct harm. This result could not be fully explained in terms of di#erences in judgments about which option was more active, more intentional, more likely to cause harm, or more subject to the disapproval of others. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for a new bias in judgment, a tendency to favor indirectly harmful options over directly harmful alternatives, irrespective of the associated outcomes, intentions, or self-presentational concerns. We speculate that this bias could originate from the use of a typical but somewhat unreliable property of harmful acts, their directness, as a cue to moral evaluation. We discuss the implications of the bias for a range of social issues, including the distinction between passive and <b>active</b> euthanasia, legal <b>deterrence,</b> and the rhetoric of a#rmative action...|$|R

KEY WORDS: tragic moral choices; omission bias; direct vs. indirect harm; Kant. Judgments about decisions often favor options that lead to worse consequences than the alternatives. In the endowment effect, people are unwilling to give up their endowment for what they would otherwise prefer to it (Kahneman et al., 1990). In omission bias, people are unwilling to bring about a preferred outcome through harmful action, when the alternative involves omission that is even more harmful (Ritov and Baron, 1990; Spranca et al., 1991). Many preference reversals show that some means of eliciting choices must lead to nonoptimal outcomes, that is, outcomes that the decision maker herself would find less desirable than the available alternatives (e. g., Hsee et al., 1999) ...|$|R
