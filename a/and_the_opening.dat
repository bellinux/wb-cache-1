They include score music composed by Shinkichi Mitsumune, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> theme and the two ending themes.|$|E
5|$|Residential {{development}} {{had been}} gradually spreading westward from Belgravia since the 1840s, but {{the area around}} the station site was mainly in horticultural use as market gardens when the new line was constructed. The planning of the line encouraged the local land owners, including Lord Kensington, to extend Cromwell Road westwards <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of Gloucester Road station, stimulated rapid residential development in the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|The geology of {{the borough}} is unremarkable; the bedrock is mainly {{composed}} of sand with patches of clay {{to the east}} and west, and superficial deposits (drift) of sand and gravel cover the entire area.

Two {{days before the}} first service, the Metropolitan Board of Works was {{replaced}} by the London County Council (LCC), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> ceremony was conducted by Lord Rosebery instead of the expected Bazalgette. The sister vessel, Duncan was introduced on 20 April.|$|E

5|$|Buchanan County brought ASL to Grundy {{in order}} to revitalize a town {{that had been in}} a steady {{economic}} decline since the town's Flood of 1977. ASL has brought a positive economic impact on its home town, including spurring construction of rental homes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of additional businesses in the area. ASL has become a success story for the concept of higher education as an economic development tool. The school has brought in $12 million per year to the local economy. ASL's economic success spurred the conception and implementation of the Appalachian College of Pharmacy (formerly University of Appalachia College of Pharmacy), which was founded in 2003 and opened its doors in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Cold Fear was {{met with}} mixed reviews, with many critics {{comparing}} it unfavorably to Resident Evil 4. Although critics were generally impressed with the environments <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> scenes, they found the game too short and felt it {{failed to live up}} to its promising beginning. The game was a commercial failure; by February 2006, it had sold only 70,000 units across all three platforms in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Fakih {{was made}} the Minister of Religious Affairs in the Wilopo Cabinet and sworn in on 3 April 1952, {{which led to}} him and his family moving to the capital at Jakarta. He began to work on {{reforming}} the ministry, including formalising its mission statement: to provide religious teachers, promote interfaith relations, and to establish the dates of religious holidays. He worked on internal structure, including formalising the ministry's leadership hierarchy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of the provincial and regional branches. The ministry also continued its promotion of religious education and was tasked with handling the numerous Indonesian pilgrims who went on the hajj. The Wilopo Cabinet collapsed on 30 July 1953, following an immigration and land dispute in Medan. Fakih was replaced by Masjkur.|$|E
5|$|From 1800 to 1847, Banagher {{enjoyed a}} period of {{prosperity}} unequalled in its history. Corn growing had long {{been one of the}} chief agricultural activities of the district <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of the Grand Canal {{at the end of the}} 18th century gave easy access to Dublin and Limerick and brought cheap and efficient water transport to the district. Banagher became the outlet for the grain raised in a wide area round the town, and the Banagher corn market on Fridays was one of the largest of its kind in Ireland.|$|E
30|$|The {{analysis}} {{indicates that}} the critical load is sensitive to the circumferential size of <b>the</b> <b>opening.</b> <b>The</b> function (critical load-circumferential size of <b>the</b> <b>opening)</b> is linear for large <b>openings</b> <b>and</b> independent of <b>the</b> geometrical imperfections of the shell. However, for small openings, {{it is necessary to}} take into account the coupling between the initial geometrical imperfections <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>openings.</b>|$|R

5|$|Hopes {{that the}} ballet {{would be ready}} in May were dashed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> night was {{postponed}} several times. Grisi was absent {{for a few days}} and her return was delayed to protect her health. Lighting, trapdoors, and scene changes needed further rehearsals. Cuts were made in Grisi's role to spare the dancer's health. Instead of returning to her tomb {{at the end of the}} ballet, it was decided that she would be placed on a bed of flowers and sink slowly into the earth. This touch preserved the romantic mood of the Act II finale.|$|E
5|$|III. Scherzo: Allegro vivace con delicatezza – Trio. The {{first part}} of the scherzo proper cadences not in the tonic or dominant, but in the subdominant. The second, B part, {{continues}} to modulate by ascending fourths, until it reaches the key of D-flat major. In this key, a new theme is presented, emphasizing the local subdominant (G-flat major, a further fourth upward) – first in the major mode, then in the minor, with an enharmonic shift to F-sharp minor. This harmonic excursion eventually leads, through A major and a B diminished triad, back to the tonic <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> section. The trio is in binary form and in B-flat minor, the first presentation of the tonic minor in the sonata.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, {{the celebration}} of 200 years since {{the arrival of the}} First Fleet was {{organised}} on a large scale, with many significant events taking place in all major cities. Over 2.5million people attended the event in Sydney. These included street parties, concerts, including performances on the steps and forecourt of the Sydney Opera House and at many other public venues, art and literary competitions, historic re-enactments, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of the Powerhouse Museum at its new location. A re-enactment of the arrival of the First Fleet took place in Sydney Harbour, with ships that had sailed from Portsmouth a year earlier taking part.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, {{the station}} had 27,004 entries, making the station among the system's least-used. This {{amounted}} to only 52 boardings per weekday in 2009, representing a 71.6 percent decrease from the station's 1990 ridership. In 2010, there were 29,644 recorded entries, and in 2011, there were 54,183 entries. Since {{the station was}} closed through 2012, there were no boardings, but after full-time service was restored to the station in 2013, there was a significantly higher ridership, with 213,601 recorded entries in 2013 and 630,644 entries in 2014. The increase in ridership at the station and the nearby Aqueduct–North Conduit Avenue station since 2010 {{has been attributed to}} the end of off-track betting at the racetrack in 2010, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of the casino in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{the concept}} of the First World came about as a result of World War II, so did the European Union. In 1951 the {{beginnings}} of the EU were founded with the creation of European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). From the beginning of its inception, countries in the EU were judged by many standards, including economic ones. This is where the relation between globalization, the EU, and First World countries arises. Especially during the 1990s when the EU focused on economic policies such as the creation and circulation of the Euro, the creation of the European Monetary Institute, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of the European Central Bank.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Exile, {{replacing}} the Blades of Athena used in previous installments <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> moments of this game. The weapon {{is a pair}} of blades that are attached to chains wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms, which can be swung in a number of maneuvers. During the game, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Claws of Hades, the Nemean Cestus, and the Nemesis Whip—with other combat options. The Nemean Cestus, a pair of gauntlets, and the Nemesis Whip, which is similar to the Blades of Exile, are required to advance in parts of the game; for example, the Nemean Cestus is needed to break through objects composed of onyx.|$|E

5|$|Located at the {{junction}} of two earlier tube railway schemes, the station was opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP). The station entrances and below ground circulation were largely reconstructed for the introduction of escalators <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of Central line platforms in 1933, making the station the only interchange between the lines. Before 1994, Holborn was the northern terminus of the short and little-frequented Piccadilly line branch to Aldwych and two platforms originally used for this service are disused. One of the disused platforms {{has been used for}} location filming when a London Underground station platform is needed.|$|E
5|$|The Daruvar Agreement (Croatian, Serbian: Daruvarski sporazum) was a {{document}} negotiated by Croatian and Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) local {{authorities in the}} United Nations Protected Area (UNPA) for the SAO Western Slavonia, also known as Sector West on 18 February 1993, during the Croatian War of Independence. The agreement provided {{for the improvement of}} water and electrical power supply, the return of refugees to their homes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of transport routes spanning Sector West and connecting Croatian Army-controlled areas near towns of Nova Gradiška and Novska. It also provided a framework for the further improvement of living conditions of the population both in the Croatian- and RSK-controlled portions of Sector West. The agreement was named after Daruvar, the site of its signing.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the fire could not be {{determined}} with certainty. One possibility is that a fire smouldered in the furniture store Inden under the hotel, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of the elevator shaft in the morning provided an inflow of oxygen, causing the fire to spread. There is also a theory that the fire was set by burglars who tried to cover their tracks; however, {{there was no evidence}} of a burglary.|$|E
