5|$|Three {{positions}} {{are specific to}} the field goal and PAT (point-after-touchdown) unit: the placekicker (K or PK), holder (H) and long snapper (LS). The long snapper's job is to snap the football to the holder, who will catch and position it for the placekicker. There is not usually <b>a</b> <b>holder</b> on kickoffs, because the ball is kicked off of a tee; however, <b>a</b> <b>holder</b> {{may be used in}} certain situations, such as if wind is preventing the ball from remaining upright on the tee. The player on the receiving team who catches the ball is known as the kickoff returner (KR).|$|E

50|$|Diazed fuses DII {{uses the}} same E27 thread as {{standard}} 230 V lamps, but have a longer body and cannot be screwed into <b>a</b> lamp <b>holder</b> (socket). <b>A</b> lamp base is too short to contact the bottom terminal of <b>a</b> fuse <b>holder.</b> However it's possible (but not useful) to screw <b>a</b> DII fuse <b>holder</b> without <b>a</b> fuse in <b>an</b> E27 lamp <b>holder.</b>|$|R
50|$|All continuous-combustion {{jet engines}} require <b>a</b> flame <b>holder.</b> <b>A</b> flame <b>holder</b> creates <b>a</b> {{low-speed}} eddy {{in the engine}} to prevent the flame from being blown out.

5|$|Firearm {{owners are}} allowed to {{practice}} only at licensed shooting ranges and may otherwise use the firearm only in case of self-defense, or when permitted by other laws (e.g. hunting).

A person without a gun license has to be supervised (if younger than 18, then by a person at least 21 years old who has been <b>a</b> <b>holder</b> of a gun license for at least 3 years).|$|E
5|$|From 2004 until 2007, Asashōryū was sumo's sole yokozuna, and {{was criticized}} at {{times by the}} media and the Japan Sumo Association for not {{upholding}} the standards of behaviour expected of <b>a</b> <b>holder</b> of such a prestigious rank. He became the first yokozuna in history to be suspended from competition in August 2007 when he participated in a charity soccer match in his home country despite having withdrawn from a regional sumo tour claiming injury. After a career filled with a multitude of other controversies, {{both on and off the}} dohyō, his career was cut short when he retired from sumo in February 2010 after allegations that he assaulted a man outside a Tokyo nightclub.|$|E
5|$|On a kickoff, {{the ball}} is placed at the 35-yard line of the kicking team in {{professional}} and college play and at the 40-yard line in high school play. The ball may be drop-kicked or place-kicked. If a place kick is chosen, the ball can {{be placed on the}} ground or on a tee, and <b>a</b> <b>holder</b> may be used in either case. On a safety kick, the kicking team kicks the ball from their own 20-yard line. They can punt, drop-kick or place-kick the ball, but a tee may not be used in professional play. Any member of the receiving team may catch or advance the ball, and the ball may be recovered by the kicking team once it has gone at least ten yards and has touched the ground or has been touched by any member of the receiving team.|$|E
50|$|By 22 February 1530, Berthelet {{held the}} office of King's Printer under Henry VIII. <b>As</b> <b>holder</b> of that post he {{received}} an annuity of £4. Berthelet remained in the position until Henry's death. <b>As</b> <b>holder,</b> he printed the king's statutes and proclamations, and also such important works as The Bishops' Book and The King's Book.

50|$|The same {{consideration}} {{does not}} necessarily apply to <b>a</b> foreign <b>holder</b> of <b>a</b> government bond, since <b>a</b> foreign <b>holder</b> also requires compensation for potential foreign exchange movements {{in addition to the}} compensation required by <b>a</b> domestic <b>holder.</b> Since the risk free rate should theoretically exclude any risk, default or otherwise, this implies that the yields on foreign owned government debt cannot be used as the basis for calculating the risk free rate.|$|R
