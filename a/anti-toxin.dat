You will all be intensely interested in this. I {{was put on the}} track by accident. I had a typhoid case and a tetanus case {{side by side in the}} hospital: a beadle and a city missionary. Think of what that meant for them, poor fellows! Can a beadle be dignified with typhoid? Can a missionary be eloquent with lockjaw? No. NO. Well, I got some typhoid <b>anti-toxin</b> from Ridgeon and a tube of Muldooley's anti-tetanus serum. But the missionary jerked all my things off the table in one of his paroxysms; and in replacing them I put Ridgeon's tube where Muldooley's ought to have been. The consequence was that I inoculated the typhoid case for tetanus and the tetanus case for typhoid. [The doctors look greatly concerned. B. B., undamped, smiles triumphantly]. Well, they recovered.

I asked myself why didnt the missionary die of typhoid on top of tetanus, and the beadle of tetanus on top of typhoid? Theres a problem for you, Ridgeon. Think, Sir Patrick. Reflect, Blenkinsop. Look at it without prejudice, Walpole. What is the real work of the <b>anti-toxin?</b> Simply to stimulate the phagocytes. Very well. But so long as you stimulate the phagocytes, what does it matter which particular sort of serum you use for the purpose? Haha! Eh? Do you see? Do you grasp it? Ever since that Ive used all sorts of anti-toxins absolutely indiscriminately, with perfectly satisfactory results. I inoculated the little prince with your stuff, Ridgeon, because I wanted to give you a lift; but two years ago I tried the experiment of treating a scarlet fever case with a sample of hydrophobia serum from the Pasteur Institute, and it answered capitally. It stimulated the phagocytes; and the phagocytes did the rest. That is why Sir Patrick's father found that inoculation cured all fevers. It stimulated the phagocytes.

40|$|SummaryThis study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the rate of Clostridium botulinum contamination in some traditional Iranian food products (cheese, kashk and salted fish) and evaluate {{the efficacy of the}} mouse bioassay method in detection of C. botulinum toxins in these foods. A total of 131 samples (57 cheese, 11 kashk and 63 salted fish) were collected and examined {{to determine the}} rate of contamination by C. botulinum. Standard monovalent <b>anti-toxins</b> were used to determine the types of toxin. C. botulinum bacteria were detected in 4. 58 % of the examined samples (1. 52 % of cheese and 3. 06 % of salted fish samples). While no contamination was detected in the kashk samples, C. botulinum types A and E were found to be dominant in cheese and salted fish samples, respectively. These results indicate—some traditional Iranian foods may be contaminated with different types of C. botulinum, and the consumption of these products, either raw or cooked, may contribute to food-borne intoxications...|$|R
40|$|Until {{late in the}} British Raj (1857 - 1948), {{the colonial}} {{authorities}} envisaged the drug problem on the sub-continent as one of control of the illicit trade in narcotics. By the inter-war period the Government of India began to become aware that there were problems within the medicinal market. Having previously prided themselves that any medicinal drug sold by officials or given free to the poor during epidemics was as pure as science could make it, individual physicians, pharmacologists and politicians would bring to the government’s attention {{the problem of the}} adulteration of the official drugs. Using the example of quinine, this paper examines why, despite increasing evidence of the “quinine fraud,” government at both central and provincial level was slow to respond to the problem. For the provincial Chemical Examiners who were entrusted with analysing the quality of medicinal drugs, this was only one of their many tasks, and often regarded as the least important. However, India simply followed an international trend. The League of Nations Health Section preferred to set standards for biological products such as sera and <b>anti-toxins,</b> the products of newer scientific medicine, rather than for older alkaloid products such as quinine. Authorities in India, therefore, were left to attempt to create standards for medicinal products which would permit the prosecution of the crime of adulteration when it was still a controversial issue for international authorities...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHow do governments {{contribute}} to the pharmaceuticalization of society? Whilst the pivotal role of industry is extensively documented, this article shows that governments too are accelerating, intensifying and opening up new trajectories of pharmaceuticalization in society. Governments are becoming more deeply invested in pharmaceuticals because their national security strategies now aspire to defend populations against health-based threats like bioterrorism and pandemics. To counter those threats, governments are acquiring and stockpiling a panoply of ‘medical countermeasures’ such as antivirals, next-generation vaccines, antibiotics and <b>anti-toxins.</b> More than that, governments are actively incentivizing the development of many new medical countermeasures – principally by marshaling the state's unique powers to introduce exceptional measures {{in the name of}} protecting national security. At least five extraordinary policy interventions have been introduced by governments with the aim of stimulating the commercial development of novel medical countermeasures: (1) allocating earmarked public funds, (2) granting comprehensive legal protections to pharmaceutical companies against injury compensation claims, (3) introducing bespoke pathways for regulatory approval, (4) instantiating extraordinary emergency use procedures allowing for the use of unapproved medicines, and (5) designing innovative logistical distribution systems for mass drug administration outside of clinical settings. Those combined efforts, the article argues, are spawning a new, government-led and quite exceptional medical countermeasure regime operating beyond the conventional boundaries of pharmaceutical development and regulation. In the first comprehensive analysis of the pharmaceuticalization dynamics at play in national security policy, this article unearths the detailed array of policy interventions through which governments too are becoming more deeply imbricated in the pharmaceuticalization of society...|$|R

40|$|Human alpha-defensins are {{cationic}} peptides with potent antitoxic, antimicrobial and chemotactic {{activities in}} the innate and adaptive immunity. Bacillus anthracis produces a lethal factor [LF], which is a potent toxin, capable of cell lysis. The molecular mechanism of the inhibition of LF by human alpha-defensins and the bacterial strain selectivity are not fully understood. Also, the pore-formation model that relates the cationic property to the antibacterial activity of human alpha-defensins cannot fully explain the bacterial strain selectivity. The aims of this dissertation were: a) to elucidate the molecular determinants {{and the nature of}} the inhibition of LF by two well-studied alpha-defensins, human neutrophil peptide 1 [HNP 1] and human defensin 5 [HD 5], and b) to explore the mechanism of bactericidal activities of HNP 1 and HD 5 against Staphylococcus aureus [S. aureus]. We hypothesized that: a) the nature of the contact residues within these peptides influences the inhibitory activity against LF and the antibacterial effect against S. aureus, and b) the quaternary structures of HNP 1 and HD 5 are crucial to the inhibition of LF and their antibacterial effect against S. aureus. We used alanine-scan mutagenesis of HNP 1 and HD 5 followed by functional assays to identify residues that contributed to LF inhibition and bactericidal activity against S. aureus. The results identified that tryptophane 26 [Trp 26] in HNP 1 and leucine 29 [Leu 29] in HD 5 were the essential residues for the inhibition of LF and the bactericidal activity against S. aureus. Also, the results demonstrated that the hydrophobicity of HNP 1 and HD 5 as well as the dimerization and/or oligomerization were prerequisite to the LF inhibition and bactericidal activity against S. aureus. We concluded that Trp 26 and Leu 29 in HNP 1 and HD 5, respectively, as well as the hydrophobicity and self-association were the molecular determinants for LF inhibition and the bactericidal activity against S. aureus. The HNP 1 and HD 5 analogs are potentially useful tools for future studies towards the development of new <b>anti-toxins.</b> Finally, the data can potentially lead researchers to the discovery of unknown biological activities of alpha-defensins...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) causes flaccid paralysis by a multi-step mechanism. Following its binding to specific receptors at peripheral cholinergic nerve endings, BoNT/A is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Subsequently its zinc-dependent catalytic domain translocates into the neuroplasm where it cleaves a vesicle-docking protein, SNAP- 25, to block neurally evoked cholinergic neurotransmission. We tested the hypothesis that mathematical models having a minimal number of reactions and reactants can simulate published data concerning the onset of paralysis of skeletal muscles induced by BoNT/A at the isolated rat neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and in other systems. Experimental data from several laboratories were simulated with two different models that were represented by sets of coupled, first-order differential equations. In this study, the 3 -step sequential model developed by Simpson (J Pharmacol Exp Ther 212 : 16 – 21, 1980) was used to estimate upper limits of the times during which <b>anti-toxins</b> and other impermeable inhibitors of BoNT/A can exert an effect. The experimentally determined binding reaction rate was verified to be consistent with published estimates for the rate constants for BoNT/A binding to and dissociating from its receptors. Because this 3 -step model was not designed to reproduce temporal changes in paralysis with different toxin concentrations, a new BoNT/A species and rate (kS) were added {{at the beginning of the}} reaction sequence to create a 4 -step scheme. This unbound initial species is transformed at a rate determined by kS to a free species that is capable of binding. By systematically adjusting the values of kS, the 4 -step model simulated the rapid decline in NMJ function (kS ≥ 0. 01), the less rapid onset of paralysis in mice following i. m. injections (kS = 0. 001), and the slow onset of the therapeutic effects of BoNT/A (kS <  0. 001) in man. This minimal modeling approach was not only verified by simulating experimental results, it helped to quantitatively define the time available for an inhibitor to have some effect (tinhib) and the relation between this time and the rate of paralysis onset. The 4 -step model predicted that as the rate of paralysis becomes slower, the estimated upper limits of (tinhib) for impermeable inhibitors become longer. More generally, this modeling approach may be useful in studying the kinetics of other toxins or viruses that invade host cells by similar mechanisms, e. g., receptor-mediated endocytosis...|$|R
40|$|Anthrax toxin {{receptor}} (ATR) is a cell surface receptor {{that has}} been recently recognized as having a homology to Tumor endothelial marker 8 and human capillary morphogenesis protein 2. Both these proteins {{have been found to}} have an extracellular von Willebrand factor type A domain (VWA), also called integrin inserted (I) domain. VWA/I domain of the anthrax toxin receptor is located between AAs 44 and 216 of the extracellular domain of the receptor. Protective antigen (PA) is the binding moiety of the anthrax toxin and has been proved to precisely bind to the VWA/I domain of the toxin receptor. VWA domain/ I domain of ATR is highly related to VWA/I domain of the integrins and matrilins. Integrins and matrilins are adhesion molecules with non-covalently associated alpha and beta subunits that mediate cell-cell, cell-extracellular matrix, and cell-pathogen interactions. In order to understand the molecular interaction of PA to extracellular VWA/I domain of integrins/ATR, in silico docking of PA was done to the VWA / I domain of the α- 2 integrin. This VWA/I domain is the most extensively studied domain and also is a homolog of VWA/I domain of anthrax toxin receptor. Understanding the molecular interactions between VWA/I domain and protective antigen of the anthrax toxin is crucial for designing novel therapeutics targeted to block the binding of the toxin to its cell surface receptor. BiGGER soft docking algorithm was used for predicting the interactions between anthrax toxin PA and VWA/I domain of the integrins. Results were visualized using Chemera 2. 0 interface. VEGA open GL 1. 4. 3 software was used for importing the PDB files for anthrax protective antigen (PDB ID: 1 ACC) and VWA/I (PDB ID: 1 AOX) domain of α- 2 integrin. Global scoring functions for the first 10 docking solutions were in the range of 10. 43 to 6. 5. In the present study the top ranking solution has been discussed. Results show that PA domain 4 AAs from I 603 to T 716 were involved in binding to the VWA/I AAs V 193 -T 199 and Q 215 -R 243. Also, domain 2 amino acids of PA from L 271 to L 450 were also observed {{to be involved in the}} interaction with VWA domain of the integrin. MIDAS site AAs D 151, D 153, S 155, T 221 and D 254 were in close vicinity of the target: probe interface. Lysine at 679 position of PA was observed to be at the key position in interaction with the VWA domain. PA residues from K 679 to 684 were found to be in making the close contact with the target (< 2. 2 Å distance). Chemical character of the amino acids at the target: probe recognition site comprised mainly of hydrophobic non-polar amino acids. The amino acids of domain 2 of protective antigen were also observed in contact with the VWA/I domain of the integrin. Domain 2 amino acids are mainly involved in the transportation of the toxin across the membrane. In the present study the binding of PA to the VWA/I integrin domain mainly involved domain 4 and domain 2 of the protective antigen in a predominantly hydrophobic, nonpolar environment. AAs K 679 -K 684 of the PA have been speculated to play a significant role in binding to the VWA/I domain of the receptor. The present study contributes towards making a framework for future rational design of anti-receptors/ <b>anti-toxins...</b>|$|R
