40|$|The {{relationship}} between humanitarian aid and peace prospects, {{and the differences}} between this {{in the case of}} <b>a</b> proxy <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> and <b>a</b> non-proxy <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> is that in <b>a</b> proxy <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> there is <b>a</b> greater need for a specific case approach because proxy <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> are much more complicated. In <b>a</b> non-proxy <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> <b>a</b> peaceful situation has to been agreed on on the local level and humanitarian aid could contribute to peace prospects, in <b>a</b> proxy <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> humanitarian aid affects peace prospects to a lesser degree because of the multi-layered nature of this type of conflict where on all layers of the proxy <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> peace has to be agreed on. Moreover, aid providers, donors, and other (foreign) involved actors have more influence on <b>a</b> proxy <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> than in <b>a</b> non-proxy <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> and therefore humanitarian aid could adversely affect peace prospects...|$|R

5|$|Béla's {{relationship}} with his oldest son and heir, Stephen, became tense in the early 1260s, because the elderly king favored his daughter Anna and his youngest child, Béla, Duke of Slavonia.
