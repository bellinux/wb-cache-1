5|$|The {{ability to}} rapidly {{reproduce}} HeLa cells {{in a laboratory}} setting has led to many important breakthroughs in biomedical research. For example, by 1954, Jonas Salk was using HeLa cells in his research to develop the polio vaccine. To test his new vaccine, the cells were mass-produced in the first-ever cell production factory. Additionally, Chester M. Southam, a leading virologist, injected HeLa cells into cancer patients, prison inmates, and healthy individuals in order to observe if cancer could be transmitted {{as well as to}} examine if one could become immune to cancer by developing <b>an</b> <b>acquired</b> immune response.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimate}} a multilogit {{model for}} the probabilities that <b>a</b> firm will <b>acquire</b> or become <b>a</b> target in different M&A categories, which are defined according {{to the location of}} <b>an</b> <b>acquiring</b> firm with respect to a target. We find that certain firm characteristics of <b>an</b> <b>acquiring</b> firm regarded as indicative of having a high capability of monitoring a target - or internalising the potential synergies of M&A - increase the probability of distant M&As at the expense of close M&As. Factors which ease the monitoring of the target firm's value increase the probability that such a firm becomes a target located far from <b>an</b> <b>acquiring</b> firm.

25|$|Concerning {{immunological}} adaptation, it {{was discovered}} that wild common ostriches have a pronounced non specific immunity defense, with blood content reflecting high values of lysosome, and phagocyte cells in medium. This is in contrast to domesticated ostriches, who in captivity develop high concentration of immunoglobulin antibodies in their circulation, indicating <b>an</b> <b>acquired</b> immunological response. It is suggested that this immunological adaptability may allow this species to have a high success rate of survival in variable environmental settings.|$|E

Both patient classes have been shown to display slightly better improvements when using the Wii game or Wii balance board than when engaging in regular therapeutic methodologies.
