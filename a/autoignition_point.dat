The {{temperature}} {{inside the}} cylinder of a methanol-fuelled single-cylinder Ricardo E 6 research engine running under knocking conditions, {{is measured by}} means of Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS), and the pressure is measured with a pressure transducer. In order to obviate any errors arising from deficiencies in the spectral scaling laws which are commonly used to represent nitrogen Q-branch spectra at high pressure, a purely experimental technique is employed to derive temperatures from CARS spectra by cross-correlation with a reference library of spectra recorded in an accurately calibrated high-pressure high-temperature optical cell. The temperature and pressure profiles obtained from the engine running under knocking conditions, are then used as input data for chemical kinetic modelling of end-gas autoignition. Five published mechanisms (Grotheer et al 1992, Grotheer and Kelm 1989, Norton and Dryer 1989, Dove and Warnatz 1983,. and Esser and Warnatz 1987) {{are used in the}} autoignition study, and the results for the different mechanisms are compared. A good qualitative understanding of the mechanism underlying end-gas autoignition in the engine is obtained, although the calculated <b>autoignition</b> <b>points</b> occur slightly earlier than the observed point. A sensitivity analysis of the methanol autoignition system is undertaken, and the importance of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and the hydroperoxyl chemistry is demonstrated. The discrepancies between the predicted results of the different mechanisms is shown to be caused by a small number of sensitive reactions for which there are conflicting data. Finally, a linear mode analysis from the geometric qualitative theory of differential equations is performed on the non-linear chemical rate equations. The equilibrium points in the generalised phase space of the non-linear chemical system are shown to be defined in terms of three regions. The equilibrium points are unstable improper nodes in the first region (T 1170 K) ...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the mixture preparation and combustion characteristics of a direct injection gasoline (G-DI) engine operating in both spark ignition (SI) and controlled-auto ignition with spark assistance (SA-CAl) is presented. The air motion, fuel distribution and combustion performance in the engine are described by the application of advanced Laser-based experimental methods and high-speed data acquisition. Determining the correct operation of the engine for spark ignition and compression ignition formed {{an important part of}} the research study. The series of experimental studies were conducted on a Ricardo Hydra singlecylinder research engine modified for optical access through the top 20 mm section of the cylinder bore, as well as via a 45 Ã‚Â° mirror and flat window inserted in the crown of the Bowditch piston arrangement. The cylinder head used was based on the Ricardo Flagship concept engine with reverse tumble geometry. Two different interchangeable camshaft sets permitted both high and low valve lift configurations to be utilised. Spark ignition (SI) and controlled-auto ignition with spark assistance (SA-CAl) were achieved in the test programme. Laser-induced fluorescence (L 1 F), combined with simultaneous flame imaging and Particle Image Velocity (PIV) enabled qualitative in-cylinder fuel concentration measurement during fired operation and quantitative motored air motion characteristics to be determined. Simultaneous acquisition of pressure-based data during the fired studies provided a record of the in-cylinder, intake and exhaust manifold pressures. The addition of K-type thermocouples provided additional temperature information in the engine. The results attained using the above techniques showed that rates of heat release in the SA-CAl combustion mode were considerably slower than those observed in a parallel SI combustion study. This suggested that a key indicator of controlled-auto ignition (CAl) was not present in this study; it is widely considered that CAl heat release rates are of the order of those encountered in SI, when considering 4 stroke operation. This result implied that flame-front propagation was the governing mechanism of fuel oxidisation in the SA-CAl mode. However, the results of the PIV studies in the SA-CAl mode suggested that the turbulence intensity was too low to support flame-front propagation in spark-initiated combustion. High-speed photography (HSP) applied in addition to the previously mentioned techniques showed that a hybrid mode of combustion exists in the SA-CAl reaction where flame front propagation could be seen to develop alongside individual sites of autoignition within the cylinder, albeit at a considerably lower rate. Images of fuel distribution in the combustion chamber acquired from the previous studies were correlated to pressure-based combustion stability data. A statistical analysis was conducted of both the SI and SA-CAl sets of data in order to determine cyclic variability within the in-cylinder fuel concentration. The results indicated higher than expected cycle-to-cycle and in-cycle variations in fuel distribution for an early injection, homogeneous charge, combustion mode when compared to those based upon the coefficient of variation in the measured indicated mean effective pressure. The L 1 F data. from the SA-CAl studies was found to be of far lower intensity, suggesting that the presence of high levels of exhaust residuals acted to attenuate the fluorescence signal. These findings were of particular importance to the application of the L 1 F technique in this manner. From the findings of the experimental techniques applied it was possible to determine from the mode of combustion encountered, SA-CAl, that a hybrid mode of fuel oxidation was occurring. It was clear that flame-front propagation was taking place, albeit at a far slower rate than in the corresponding Sl mode, as both high EGR rates and lower turbulence intensity was found to attenuate flame propagation, with further heat release occurring through diffusion burning and numerous <b>autoignition</b> <b>points</b> throughout the cylinder through the thermal energy supplied from the resident internal EGR.

40|$|Abstract—In this study, we {{developed}} a model to predict the temperature and the pressure variation in an internal combustion engine operated in HCCI (Homogeneous charge compression ignition) mode. HCCI operation begins from aspirating of homogeneous charge mixture through intake valve like SI (Spark ignition) engine and the premixed charge is compressed until temperature and pressure of mixture reach <b>autoignition</b> <b>point</b> like diesel engine. Combustion phase was described by double-Wiebe function. The single zone model coupled with an double-Wiebe function were performed to simulated pressure and temperature between the period of IVC (Inlet valve close) and EVO (Exhaust valve open). Mixture gas properties were implemented using STANJAN and transfer the results to main model. The model has considered the engine geometry and enables varying in fuelling, equivalence ratio, manifold temperature and pressure. The results were compared with the experiment and showed good correlation with respect to combustion phasing, pressure rise, peak pressure and temperature. This model could be adapted and use to control start of combustion for HCCI engine. Keywords—Double-Wiebe function, HCCI, Ignition enhancer, Single zone model...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{performance}} and emission characteristics of a hydrous methanol fuelled homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine using the air preheater assisted controlled auto-ignition method. The HCCI engine {{has the ability to}} ignite all kinds of engine fuels irrespective of their octane and cetane number and it has a great potential to reduce NOx and smoke emissions. In this study, a regular diesel engine has been modified to work as an HCCI engine. Hydrous methanol with 15 % water is used in this HCCI engine and its performance and emission characteristics are investigated and analyzed. The intake air is preheated by a heater located on the suction side of the engine. The heater helps to raise the temperature of the air which in turn raises the temperature of the fuel-air mixture up to its <b>autoignition</b> <b>point.</b> The temperature of the preheated air is decided upon the load conditions. The experiments are conducted with hydrous methanol as engine fuel to determine the operating limit, heat release rate and exhaust emissions at different load conditions. The investigation reveals that the hydrous methanol operation reduces NO and smoke significantly more than the direct injection CI engine. Thus, hydrous methanol with 15 % water operates well in an HCCI engine without any additional operational problems...|$|E
