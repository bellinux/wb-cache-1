5|$|Muslim {{countries}} that retain or adopt Sharia usually determine which {{parts of the}} Sharia are enforceable and codify (and thereby modernize) them. Unlike other Muslim countries, Saudi Arabia regards uncodified Sharia in its entirety as {{the law of the}} land and does not interfere with it. It is, therefore, unique not only when compared to Western systems, but also in comparison to other Muslim countries, and according to one source is the closest system in the modern world to the form of Sharia <b>adopted</b> <b>at</b> the advent of Islam.|$|E
5|$|The {{emblem of}} the Order was {{designed}} by Past Supreme Knight James T. Mullen and <b>adopted</b> <b>at</b> the second Supreme Council meeting on May 12, 1883. Shields used by medieval knights served as the inspiration. The emblem consists of a shield mounted on a Formée cross, which is an artistic representation of the cross of Christ. This represents the Catholic identity of the Order.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{hardware}} {{structure of}} a liquid level detection system for lead-acid battery was briefly introduced. The system <b>adopts</b> <b>AT</b> 89 C 51 MCU as host module, combined with display storage, extended storage and the watch dog technology. The slave module <b>adopts</b> <b>AT</b> 89 C 2051 MCU, which driver the linear CCD to realize non-contact measurement in acidic and corrosive conditions. The infrared transmission module uses RS- 232 serial-to-infrared technology to realize wireless data delivery. The damage due to sensor corrosion could be avoided in this system. Compared with other similar equipments, this system has the advantages of simple structure, small volume, low cost, high measure precision and convenient maintenance...|$|R
5|$|A more {{detailed}} procedure <b>adopted</b> <b>at</b> the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was as follows: the initial mixture of actinides is processed with ion exchange using lithium chloride reagent, then precipitated as hydroxides, filtered and dissolved in nitric acid. It is then treated with high-pressure elution from cation exchange resins, and the berkelium phase is oxidized and extracted {{using one of}} the procedures described above. Reduction of the thus-obtained berkelium(IV) to the +3 oxidation state yields a solution, which is nearly free from other actinides (but contains cerium). Berkelium and cerium are then separated with another round of ion-exchange treatment.|$|E
5|$|All kanyas lack {{mothers in}} their life. Ahalya, Tara, Mandodari, Sita and Draupadi have supernatural births, while Kunti is <b>adopted</b> <b>at</b> birth and {{separated}} from a mother. Though all of kanyas {{are described as}} mothers, except Kunti, no kanya's motherhood is emphasized in their tales. Another common element {{is the theme of}} loss in their legends. Ahalya is cursed and abandoned by her family. Tara loses her husband, Draupadi her sons and Mandodari her husband, sons and kin in war. Each of them suffers a tragedy and used by men, but battles on with life and society. They are considered by Mr Pradip Bhattacharya as victims of patriarchal myth-making, however orthodox Hindus usually oppose such theoretical speculation and consider such speculation distorting the message. A free-spirited Ahalya is punished for her adultery. Druapadi, who challenges and mocks even her husbands, has her dignity repeatedly violated by men.|$|E
5|$|Allowing the enpassant capture, {{together}} {{with the introduction of}} the two-square first move for pawns, {{was one of the last}} major rule changes in European chess, and occurred between 1200 and 1600. Other relatively recent rule changes were castling, the unlimited range for queens and bishops (Spanish master Ruy López de Segura gives the rule in his 1561 book Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del axedrez) and a change to the rules on pawn promotion. In most places the en passant rule was <b>adopted</b> <b>at</b> the same time as allowing the pawn to move two squares on its first move, but it was not universally accepted until the Italian rules were changed in 1880.|$|E

Raised in a family where she was the second of three children, she spent her {{childhood}} in Northamptonshire and Bath. Her father was an engineer who later became a lecturer at Bath College, and her mother a biology teacher.

Although she was keen to follow a career in broadcasting, careers advisors at school steered her towards teaching instead.|$|E
5|$|Liliʻuokalani {{was born}} on September 2, 1838, in Honolulu, {{on the island of}} Oʻahu. While her natural parents were Analea Keohokālole and Caesar Kapaʻakea, she was hānai (informally <b>adopted)</b> <b>at</b> birth by Abner Pākī and Laura Kōnia and raised with their {{daughter}} Bernice Pauahi Bishop. Baptized as a Christian and educated at the Royal School, she and her siblings and cousins were proclaimed eligible for the throne by King Kamehameha III. She was married to American-born John Owen Dominis, who later became the Governor of Oʻahu. The couple had no biological children but adopted several. After the accession of her brother David Kalākaua to the throne in 1874, she and her siblings were given Western style titles of Prince and Princess. In 1877, after her younger brother Leleiohoku II's death, she was proclaimed as heir apparent to the throne. During the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria, she represented her brother as an official envoy to the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Pakistan {{has several}} {{official}} national symbols including a historic document, a flag, an emblem, an anthem, a memorial tower {{as well as}} several national heroes. The symbols were <b>adopted</b> <b>at</b> various stages in the existence of Pakistan and there are various rules and regulations governing their definition or use. The oldest symbol is the Lahore Resolution, adopted by the All India Muslim League on 23 March 1940, and which presented the official demand {{for the creation of a}} separate country for the Muslims of India. The Minar-e-Pakistan memorial tower which was built in 1968 on the site where the Lahore Resolution was passed. The national flag was adopted just before independence was achieved on 14 August 1947. The national anthem and the state emblem were each adopted in 1954. There are also several other symbols including the national animal, bird, flower and tree.|$|E

5|$|The Arab Ba'ath Party's first {{congress}} {{was held in}} Damascus in 1947. Aflaq took the pre-eminent position of Amid, sometimes translated as 'doyen' or as 'leader'; and was elected to a four-member executive committee. Under the constitution <b>adopted</b> <b>at</b> the congress, this made him effective leader of the party, with sweeping powers within the organisation; al-Bitar was elected Secretary General of the National Command. Zaki al-Arsuzi, {{the leader of the}} Arab Ba'ath, was not given any position, or membership in the party. Aflaq as Amid was responsible for ideological affairs and became the party's mentor, while al-Bitar controlled the party's day-to-day management. The merger would prove problematic, several members of the al-Arsuzi-led Ba'ath Party were more left-leaning, and would become, later in Aflaq's tenure as leader, highly critical of his leadership.|$|E
5|$|The NS-10 {{displaced}} the Auratone 5C Sound Cube as the nearfield monitor {{of choice}} in the 1980s and was recognised {{for its ability to}} reveal shortcomings in recordings. It probably first reached American shores through a recording engineer's visit to Japan. The engineer, likely to have been Greg Ladanyi, monitored a recording session through the speaker in a Japanese studio and brought a pair back on his return to the US. Ladanyi then began using the speakers in a Los Angeles studio. Other engineers heard the NS-10 {{for the first time and}} were impressed by its sound. Its use spread to New York where the NS-10 was <b>adopted</b> <b>at</b> The Power Station and other studios.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the irreversible {{adoption of a}} technology whose returns are uncertain, {{when there is an}} advantage to being the first adopter, but a network advantage to adopting when others also adopt. There are two main results. First, conditional on adoption being sequential, the follower <b>adopts</b> <b>at</b> the incorrect point, compared with the cooperative solution. The leader <b>adopts</b> <b>at</b> the cooperative point when there is no preemption, and too early if there is preemption. Secondly, there is insufficient simultaneous adoption in equilibrium. The paper examines how these inefficiencies vary as the degree of uncertainty and network effects change. Interesting interactions between the various factors are found. For example, the analysis raises the interesting possibility that the introduction of a small amount of uncertainty can cause the first mover to adopt the technology earlier. ...|$|R
