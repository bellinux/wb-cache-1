5|$|The {{intermetallic}} compounds of the alkali metals with the heavier group 13 elements (aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium), such as NaTl, are poor conductors or semiconductors, unlike the normal alloys with the preceding elements, {{implying that the}} alkali metal involved has lost an electron to the Zintl anions involved. Nevertheless, while the elements in group 14 and beyond tend to form discrete <b>anionic</b> clusters, group 13 elements tend to form polymeric ions with the alkali metal cations located between the giant ionic lattice. For example, NaTl consists of a polymeric anion (—Tl−—)n with a covalent diamond cubic structure with Na+ ions located between the <b>anionic</b> lattice. The larger alkali metals cannot fit similarly into an <b>anionic</b> lattice and tend to force the heavier group 13 elements to form <b>anionic</b> clusters.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} boranes are diborane B2H6 {{and two of}} its pyrolysis products, pentaborane B5H9 and decaborane B10H14. A large number of <b>anionic</b> boron hydrides are known, e.g. 2−.|$|E
5|$|The uranium {{fraction}} diagrams in {{the presence}} of carbonate illustrate this further: when the pH of a uranium(VI) solution increases, the uranium is converted to a hydrated uranium oxide hydroxide and at high pHs it becomes an <b>anionic</b> hydroxide complex.|$|E
5|$|It {{has some}} {{properties}} that are {{unusual for a}} metal; taken together, these are sometimes used as a basis to classify aluminium as a metalloid. Its crystalline structure shows some evidence of directional bonding. Aluminium bonds covalently in most compounds. The oxide Al2O3 is amphoteric, and a conditional glass-former. Aluminium can form <b>anionic</b> aluminates, such behaviour being considered nonmetallic in character.|$|E
5|$|Many {{types of}} ylides can be {{prepared}} with various functional groups both on the <b>anionic</b> carbon center and on the sulfur. The substitution pattern can influence the ease of preparation for the reagents (typically from the sulfonium halide, e.g. trimethylsulfonium iodide) and overall reaction rate in various ways. The general format for the reagent is shown on the right.|$|E
5|$|Organolithium {{compounds}} {{are widely}} used {{in the production of}} polymer and fine-chemicals. In the polymer industry, which is the dominant consumer of these reagents, alkyl lithium compounds are catalysts/initiators. in <b>anionic</b> polymerization of unfunctionalized olefins. For the production of fine chemicals, organolithium compounds function as strong bases and as reagents for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Organolithium compounds are prepared from lithium metal and alkyl halides.|$|E
5|$|The three {{fluorides}} {{of chlorine}} form {{a subset of}} the interhalogen compounds, all of which are diamagnetic. Some cationic and <b>anionic</b> derivatives are known, such as , , , and Cl2F+. Some pseudohalides of chlorine are also known, such as cyanogen chloride (ClCN, linear), chlorine cyanate (ClNCO), chlorine thiocyanate (ClSCN, unlike its oxygen counterpart), and chlorine azide (ClN3).|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{oxychloride}} (BiOCl, {{see figure}} at right) and bismuth oxynitrate (BiONO3) stoichiometrically appear as simple <b>anionic</b> salts of the bismuthyl(III) cation (BiO+) which commonly occurs in aqueous bismuth compounds. However, {{in the case}} of BiOCl, the salt crystal forms in a structure of alternating plates of Bi, O, and Cl atoms, with each oxygen coordinating with four bismuth atoms in the adjacent plane. This mineral compound is used as a pigment and cosmetic (see below).|$|E
5|$|Some of astatine's {{reported}} {{properties are}} nonmetallic. It has the narrow liquid range ordinarily associated with nonmetals (mp 302°C; bp 337°C). Batsanov gives a calculated band gap energy for astatine of 0.7eV; {{this is consistent}} with nonmetals (in physics) having separated valence and conduction bands and thereby being either semiconductors or insulators. The chemistry of astatine in aqueous solution is mainly characterised by the formation of various <b>anionic</b> species. Most of its known compounds resemble those of iodine, which is a halogen and a nonmetal. Such compounds include astatides (XAt), astatates (XAtO3), and monovalent interhalogen compounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} form {{complete}} series of compounds with all usually encountered anions, which well illustrate group trends. These compounds {{can be described}} as involving the alkali metals losing electrons to acceptor species and forming monopositive ions. This description is most accurate for alkali halides and becomes less and less accurate as cationic and <b>anionic</b> charge increase, and as the anion becomes larger and more polarisable. For instance, ionic bonding gives way to metallic bonding along the series NaCl, Na2O, Na2S, Na3P, Na3As, Na3Sb, Na3Bi, Na.|$|E
5|$|The {{interactions}} of carbonate anions with uranium(VI) cause the Pourbaix diagram to change greatly when the medium is changed from {{water to a}} carbonate containing solution. While {{the vast majority of}} carbonates are insoluble in water (students are often taught that all carbonates other than those of alkali metals are insoluble in water), uranium carbonates are often soluble in water. This is because a U(VI) cation is able to bind two terminal oxides and three or more carbonates to form <b>anionic</b> complexes.|$|E
5|$|The {{nonmetallic}} {{character of}} selenium {{is shown by}} its brittleness and the low electrical conductivity (~10−9 to 10−12S•cm−1) of its highly purified form. This is comparable to or {{less than that of}} bromine (7.95S•cm−1), a nonmetal. Selenium has the electronic band structure of a semiconductor and retains its semiconducting properties in liquid form. It has a relatively high electronegativity (2.55 revised Pauling scale). Its reaction chemistry is mainly that of its nonmetallic <b>anionic</b> forms Se2−, SeO and SeO.|$|E
5|$|Iron is {{the first}} of the {{transition}} metals that cannot reach its group oxidation state of +8, although its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium can, with ruthenium having more difficulty than osmium. Ruthenium exhibits an aqueous cationic chemistry in its low oxidation states similar to that of iron, but osmium does not, favoring high oxidation states in which it forms <b>anionic</b> complexes. In fact, in this second half of the 3d transition series, vertical similarities down the groups compete with the horizontal similarities of iron with its neighbors cobalt and nickel in the periodic table, which are also ferromagnetic at room temperature and share similar chemistry. As such, iron, cobalt, and nickel are sometimes grouped together as the iron triad.|$|E
5|$|Morpholinos are {{synthetic}} {{molecules that}} {{are the product of}} a redesign of natural nucleic acid structure. Usually 25 bases in length, they bind to complementary sequences of RNA or single-stranded DNA by standard nucleic acid base-pairing. In terms of structure, the difference between Morpholinos and DNA is that, while Morpholinos have standard nucleic acid bases, those bases are bound to morpholine rings linked through phosphorodiamidate groups instead of phosphates. The figure compares the structures of the two strands depicted there, one of RNA and the other of a Morpholino. Replacement of <b>anionic</b> phosphates with the uncharged phosphorodiamidate groups eliminates ionization in the usual physiological pH range, so Morpholinos in organisms or cells are uncharged molecules. The entire backbone of a Morpholino is made from these modified subunits.|$|E
5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. Many {{of them have been}} estimated based on the element's position on the periodic table as a heavier analog of iodine, {{and a member of the}} halogens (the group of elements including fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). Astatine is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a semiconductor or possibly a metal; it probably has a higher melting point than that of iodine. Chemically, several <b>anionic</b> species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine. It also shows some metallic behavior, including being able to form a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution (unlike the lighter halogens).|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of arsenic is predominately nonmetallic. Whether or not arsenic forms a cation is unclear. Its many metal alloys are mostly brittle. It shows fewer tendencies to <b>anionic</b> behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by {{the formation of}} oxyanions. Arsenic generally forms compounds {{in which it has}} an oxidation state of +3 or +5. The halides, and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples. In the trivalent state, arsenic shows some incipient metallic properties. The halides are hydrolysed by water but these reactions, particularly those of the chloride, are reversible {{with the addition of a}} hydrohalic acid. The oxide is acidic but, as noted below, (weakly) amphoteric. The higher, less stable, pentavalent state has strongly acidic (nonmetallic) properties. Compared to phosphorus, the stronger metallic character of arsenic is indicated by the formation of oxoacid salts such as AsPO4, As2(SO4)3 and arsenic acetate As(CH3COO)3. The oxide As2O3 is polymeric, amphoteric, and a glass former. Arsenic has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see organoarsenic chemistry).|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of fermium {{has only been}} studied in solution using tracer techniques, and no solid compounds have been prepared. Under normal conditions, fermium exists in solution as the Fm3+ ion, which has a hydration number of 16.9 and an acid dissociation constant of 1.6 (pKa= 3.8). Fm3+ forms complexes {{with a wide variety}} of organic ligands with hard donor atoms such as oxygen, and these complexes are usually more stable than those of the preceding actinides. It also forms <b>anionic</b> complexes with ligands such as chloride or nitrate and, again, these complexes appear to be more stable than those formed by einsteinium or californium. It is believed that the bonding in the complexes of the later actinides is mostly ionic in character: the Fm3+ ion is expected to be smaller than the preceding An3+ ions because of the higher effective nuclear charge of fermium, and hence fermium would be expected to form shorter and stronger metal–ligand bonds.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of silicon is generally nonmetallic (covalent) in nature. It {{is not known}} to form a cation. Silicon can form alloys with metals such as iron and copper. It shows fewer tendencies to <b>anionic</b> behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. The high strength of the silicon-oxygen bond dominates the chemical behaviour of silicon. Polymeric silicates, built up by tetrahedral SiO4 units sharing their oxygen atoms, are the most abundant and important compounds of silicon. The polymeric borates, comprising linked trigonal and tetrahedral BO3 or BO4 units, are built on similar structural principles. The oxide SiO2 is polymeric in structure, weakly acidic, and a glass former. Traditional organometallic chemistry includes the carbon compounds of silicon (see organosilicon).|$|E

25|$|An MBAS assay {{indicates}} <b>anionic</b> surfactants {{in water}} with a bluing reaction.|$|E
25|$|The second {{route is}} {{ring-opening}} polymerization of laurolactam at 260-300˚C. Ring opening {{can be carried}} out by cationic or <b>anionic</b> initiators, although cationic initiators have not been used commercially due to the product being less stable and oxidized relatively quickly in comparison to those produced by activated <b>anionic</b> polymerization (monomer casting). Ring-opening polymerization is the preferred route for commercial production.|$|E
25|$|Two {{is added}} for every halide or other <b>anionic</b> ligand which binds {{to the metal}} through a sigma bond.|$|E
25|$|The MBAS assay cannot {{distinguish}} between specific surfactants, however. Some examples of <b>anionic</b> surfactants are carboxylates, phosphates, sulfates, and sulfonates.|$|E
25|$|One {{is added}} for every halide or other <b>anionic</b> ligand which binds {{to the central}} atom through a sigma bond.|$|E
25|$|A color {{reaction}} in an acidified, aqueous methylene blue solution containing chloroform can detect <b>anionic</b> surfactants {{in a water}} sample. Such a test is known as an MBAS assay (methylene blue active substances assay).|$|E
25|$|Many hormones, toxins, inhibitors, or {{antimicrobial}} peptides interact {{specifically with}} transmembrane protein complexes. They can also accumulate at the lipid bilayer surface, prior to binding their protein targets. Such polypeptide ligands are often positively charged and interact electrostatically with <b>anionic</b> membranes.|$|E
25|$|Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB)(C45H44N3NaO7S2; mW: 825.97) is {{the most}} popular protein stain. It is an <b>anionic</b> dye, which non-specifically binds to proteins. The {{structure}} of CBB is predominantly non-polar, and it is usually used in methanolic solution acidified with acetic acid. Proteins in the gel are fixed by acetic acid and simultaneously stained. The excess dye incorporated into the gel can be removed by destaining with the same solution without the dye. The proteins are detected as blue bands on a clear background. As SDS is also <b>anionic,</b> it may interfere with staining process. Therefore, large volume of staining solution is recommended, at least ten times the volume of the gel.|$|E
25|$|Attaching ionic ligands to {{nanoparticles}} allows {{control over}} enzyme activity. An example of enzyme inhibition {{is given by}} binding of a-chymotrypsin (ChT), an enzyme with a largely cationic active site. When a-chymotrypsin is incubated with <b>anionic</b> (negatively charged) nanoparticles, ChT activity is inhibited as <b>anionic</b> nanoparticles bind to the active site. Enzyme activity can be restored {{by the addition of}} cationic surfactants. Alkyl surfactants form a bilayer around ChT, whereas thiol and alcohol surfactants alter the surface of ChT such that interactions with nanoparticles are interrupted. Though formation of a protein-nanoparticle complex can inhibit enzyme activity, studies show that it can also stabilize protein structure, and significantly protect the protein from denaturization.|$|E
25|$|A unique {{feature of}} this temple is the bejeweled image of Lord Nataraja as the main deity. It depicts Lord Shiva as the master of Koothu-Bharata Natyam {{and is one of}} the few temples where Lord Shiva is {{represented}} by an anthropomorphic murthi rather than the classic, <b>anionic</b> Lingam.|$|E
25|$|Chemically, {{they are}} characterised—to varying degrees—by {{covalent}} bonding tendencies, acid-base amphoterism {{and the formation}} of <b>anionic</b> species such as aluminates, stannates, and bismuthates (in the case of aluminium, tin, and bismuth, respectively). They can also form Zintl phases (half-metallic compounds formed between highly electropositive metals and moderately electronegative metals or metalloids).|$|E
25|$|Rayner-Canham and Overton use {{the term}} {{chemically}} weak metals {{to refer to the}} metals close to the metal-nonmetal borderline. These metals behave chemically more like the metalloids, particularly with respect to <b>anionic</b> species formation. The nine chemically weak metals identified by them are beryllium, aluminium, zinc, gallium, tin, lead, antimony, bismuth, and polonium.|$|E
25|$|Diol {{catalysts}} {{are thought}} to engage substrate with a single hydrogen bond, with the other hydroxyl participating in an internal hydrogen bond. These {{are some of the}} earliest hydrogen bond catalysts investigated. They are most commonly used in stabilizing partial <b>anionic</b> charge in transition states, for example coordinating to aldehyde dienophiles in hetero-Diels-Alder reactions.|$|E
25|$|In another {{application}} DOM {{is applied}} in placing a bulky tert-butyl group in an ortho position (scheme 4). The lithiation is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution {{and the subsequent}} reaction to the sulfoxide an electrophilic aromatic substitution. In the final step tert-butyllithium acts as a nucleophile in another nucleophilic aromatic substitution through an <b>anionic</b> intermediate.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the first}} studies on the cation-π {{interaction}} involved looking at the interactions of charged, nitrogenous molecules in cyclophane host-guest chemistry. It was found that even when <b>anionic</b> solubilizing groups were appended to aromatic host capsules, cationic guests preferred to associate with the π-system in many cases. The type of host shown to the right was also able to catalyze N-alkylation reactions to form cationic products.|$|E
25|$|Many useful organic {{reactions}} {{involve the}} formation of tetrahedral intermediates through nucleophilic attack of functional groups such as aldehydes, amides or imines. In these cases, catalysis with hydrogen bond donors is an attractive strategy since the <b>anionic</b> tetrahedral intermediates are better hydrogen bond acceptors than the starting compound. This means that relative to the initial catalyst-substrate complex, the transition state, bearing more negative charge, is stabilized.|$|E
25|$|This {{limitation}} can {{be overcome}} by polymerizing directly on the surface. This process {{is referred to as}} grafting from, or surface-initiated polymerization (SIP). As the name suggests, the initiator molecules must be immobilized on the solid surface. Like other polymerization methods, SIP can be tailored to follow radical, <b>anionic,</b> or cationic mechanisms and can be controlled utilizing reversible addition transfer polymerization (RAFT), atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), or nitroxide-mediated techniques.|$|E
