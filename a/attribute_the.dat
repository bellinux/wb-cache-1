30|$|Mapper: The “mapper” tag {{is used to}} {{describe}} the mapping relationship between attributes of elements. There are usually two <b>attributes</b> in <b>the</b> “mapper” tag, the key and value <b>attributes.</b> <b>The</b> value <b>attribute</b> describes <b>the</b> target <b>attribute</b> in <b>the</b> customized model and <b>the</b> key <b>attribute</b> describes <b>the</b> target <b>attribute</b> in Cloud resource runtime models. The element, which <b>the</b> <b>attributes</b> belong to, is defined in the outer “helper” tag.|$|R
5|$|Ramarayaningar was {{regarded}} as an advocate of democracy and a staunch supporter of empowerment of the depressed classes. Historians generally <b>attribute</b> <b>the</b> decline of the Justice Party in the mid-1930s {{to the absence of}} charismatic leaders in the Justice Party following his death.|$|E
5|$|Thirdly, the teleological {{explanation}} of adaptation is uncomfortable {{because it seems}} to require backward causation, in which existing traits are explained by future outcomes; {{because it seems to}} <b>attribute</b> <b>the</b> action of a conscious mind when none is assumed to be present in an organism; and because, as a result, adaptation looks impossible to test empirically.|$|E
5|$|Events of {{the later}} years of the reign showed that Constantinople itself was not safe from barbarian incursions from the north, and even the {{relatively}} benevolent historian Menander Protector {{felt the need to}} <b>attribute</b> <b>the</b> Emperor's failure to protect the capital to the weakness of his body in his old age. In his efforts to renew the Roman Empire, Justinian dangerously stretched its resources while failing {{to take into account the}} changed realities of 6th-century Europe.|$|E

5|$|On 10 May 2016, an {{explosion}} near Damascus International Airport killed top military commander Mustafa Badreddine. Lebanese media sources <b>attributed</b> <b>the</b> attack to an Israeli airstrike. Hezbollah <b>attributed</b> <b>the</b> attack to Syrian opposition.|$|R
5|$|In {{the long}} term, however, the British backed Iraq and {{rejected}} an international {{inquiry into the}} killings, fearing that this may provoke further massacres against Christians. They also did not insist on punishing the offenders, who were now seen as heroes by Iraqis. The official British stance was to defend the Iraqi government for its perseverance and patience {{in dealing with the}} crisis and to <b>attribute</b> <b>the</b> massacres to rogue army units. A report on the battle of Dirabun blames the Assyrians, defends the actions of the Iraqi Army, and commends Sidqi as a good officer.|$|E
5|$|Jerusalem is {{recognized}} as a sacred site in Islam. Though the Quran does not mention Jerusalem by name, it has been understood by Islamic scholars since the earliest times that many passages in the Quran refer to Jerusalem. Jerusalem is also mentioned {{many times in the}} hadith. Some academics <b>attribute</b> <b>the</b> holiness of Jerusalem to the rise and expansion of a certain type of literary genre, known as al-Fadhail or history of cities. The Fadhail of Jerusalem inspired Muslims, especially during the Umayyad period, to embellish the sanctity of the city beyond its status in the holy texts. Others point to the political motives of the Umayyad dynasty which led to the sanctification of Jerusalem in Islam.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} thus generally <b>attribute</b> <b>the</b> numbers {{given in}} the ancient sources to the result of miscalculations or exaggerations {{on the part of}} the victors, or disinformation by the Persians in the run up to the war. The topic has been hotly debated but the modern consensus revolves around the figure of 300,000500,000. Nevertheless, whatever the real numbers were, it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea, and also that much of the army died of starvation and disease, never returning to Asia.|$|E

5|$|Panzer Dragoon Sagas battles {{take place}} while flying on the dragon. They mix {{real-time}} and turn-based elements, with three action gauges that charge in real time. When a gauge fills, the player {{can make a}} move, such as attacking or using an item such as a shield or poison cure. Waiting for multiple gauges to charge facilitates more options, such as making multiple moves in quick succession, but this gives the enemy more opportunity to attack. The speed at which the gauges charge is governed by the dragon's agility attribute; if this {{is higher than the}} enemy's agility <b>attribute,</b> <b>the</b> player can make moves more frequently than the enemy, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire are {{adjoining}} historical {{counties in}} SW Wales. Different tales {{have been told}} of the corgi's origin: some believe that the two modern breeds evolved from a shared ancestry, while others <b>attribute</b> <b>the</b> import of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi to Flemish weavers starting around the 10th century. Further theories {{on the origin of}} the Pembroke variety suggest that they may have originated from central European herding breeds from the area around modern Germany. Depending on the time period when these dogs were imported to Wales, they could have been either the extinct Deutsches Brachen, or the Dachshund breed.|$|E
5|$|Some {{aspects of}} the mysteries of Isis and of other mystery cults, {{particularly}} their connection with the afterlife, resemble important elements of Christianity. The {{question of whether the}} mysteries influenced Christianity is controversial and the evidence is unclear; some scholars today <b>attribute</b> <b>the</b> similarities to a shared cultural background rather than direct influence. In contrast, Apuleius's account has had direct effects in modern times. Through his description of them, the mysteries of Isis have influenced many works of fiction and modern fraternal organizations, as well as a widespread, though false, belief that the ancient Egyptians themselves had an elaborate system of mystery initiations.|$|E

5|$|The Late Woodland era is {{generally}} considered to have begun about 600 AD and lasted until the arrival of Europeans in Indiana. It {{was a period of}} rapid cultural change. One of the new developments—which has yet to be explained—was the introduction of masonry, shown by the construction of large, stone forts, many of which overlook the Ohio River. Romantic legend used to <b>attribute</b> <b>the</b> forts to Welsh Indians who supposedly arrived centuries before Christopher Columbus reached the Caribbean. Archaeologists and other scholars have found no evidence for that theory and believe that the cultural development was engendered by the Mississippian culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{actions of}} Graham and Macdonnell {{continue}} {{to be remembered as}} an iconic moment in the battle of Waterloo. In 1915, cigarette manufacturers W.D. & H.O. Wills portrayed Graham and Macdonnell on one of the cigarette cards printed to commemorate the centenary of Waterloo. Since then, many authors of fiction concerning Waterloo have recreated the events at the gate, and even if they include their own fictional heroes they <b>attribute</b> <b>the</b> closing of the gate to Macdonnell and Graham.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} is resolved {{in a manner}} simultaneously elegant and eccentric, in an almost exuberant and free syntax. The canonical orders are absent, and the collection is conceived as an imaginative blend of quasi-archaeological redeployment. For this reason, critics do not <b>attribute</b> <b>the</b> project to Cairano, which remains a formidable invention that is highly representative of antiquarian culture of the time. Surely Cairano's, however, is the hand that produced the sculptures along with anthropomorphic figures, dolphins and fantastic creatures, the artist already experimented with these in the Loggia; and once again, the artist inserted small Caesars, both on the portal {{as well as the}} overpass, which achieve the poetic zenith of some of his portraiture of old.|$|E

The EC delegation's failure to respond to Jović's departure before the plenary meeting and the EC foreign ministers' declaration of 10 July indicating the EC would withdraw from mediation if the Brioni Agreement was not implemented only encouraged Serbia which, unlike Slovenia, Croatia, or the Yugoslav federation, had nothing to lose if the EC pulled out. In the end, the EC took credit for a rapid resolution of the armed conflict in Slovenia without realising that its diplomatic efforts {{had little to do with}} the situation on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the project}} was closely tied to the other two games, and Sneak Kings {{development}} was directly led by Burger King. The game started as a tile-based puzzle game, but quickly became a Spy vs Spy-style caper until Burger King made design choices that removed conventional hazards and competition elements in favor of a stealth game with no human opponents. Sneak King did not win critical acclaim and its reviews often reflected its unusual design elements, but the project was a financial success and resulted in millions of units being sold. Collectively, the games ranked amongst the top 10 best selling games of 2006. Burger King's Russell Klein would <b>attribute</b> <b>the</b> three game project as being {{the driving force behind the}} company's 40% quarterly sales increase.|$|E
5|$|Drawloom: The {{earliest}} confirmed drawloom fabrics {{come from}} the State of Chu and date c. 400 BC. Most scholars <b>attribute</b> <b>the</b> invention of the drawloom to the ancient Chinese, although some speculate an independent invention from ancient Syria since drawloom fabrics found in Dura-Europas are thought to date before 256 AD. Dieter Kuhn states that an analysis of texts and textiles from the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) proves that the figured fabrics of that era were also crafted {{with the use of}} a drawloom. The drawloom was certainly known in Persia by the 6th century AD. Eric Broudy asserts there is virtually no evidence of its use in Europe until the 17th century, while the button drawloom was allegedly invented by Jean le Calabrais in the 15th century. Mary Carolyn Beaudry disagrees, stating that it was used in the medieval Italian silk industry.|$|E
