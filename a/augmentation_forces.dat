50|$|As {{part of the}} {{fall-out}} {{from the}} aborted Panamanian elections, the Army sent a package of <b>augmentation</b> <b>forces</b> to Panama (Operation NIMROD DANCER)- which included a mechanized battalion from the 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized), based at Fort Polk, Louisiana; this battalion {{was attached to the}} Brigade, forming Task Force Bayonet. Later in the fall of 1989, the Brigade instituted an intensive training program to prepare for combat operations, which seemed increasingly likely after the failure of the second coup, in October. In December 1989, two years of diplomatic tension between Panama and the United States came to a head. In a speech to a gathering of his supporters, General Manuel Noriega - the head of the PDF and de facto dictator of Panama - declared that a state of war existed between the United States and Panama. This might well have been dismissed as simply more of his defiant, anti-US rhetoric, were it not for two events that followed within a matter of hours. A U.S. Marine officer was shot and killed at a PDF checkpoint, and then a U.S. Navy officer and his wife in the following car were arrested, taken to the Commandancia and beaten and abused for several hours. In light of this series of events, President George Bush ordered the invasion of Panama, codenamed Operation Just Cause, to protect American lives and property, and to permit the inauguration of the winners of the previous summer's elections.|$|E
50|$|On December 1, 1950 due {{to concern}} of a Soviet threat to Western Europe during the Korean War, Seventh Army was {{activated}} {{as a field}} army in Europe (Ca. 4 years earlier, in March 1947, U.S. European Command EUCOM had designated that all EUCOM combat forces were to convert to “Occupation duties”). Seventh Army absorbed the two main Occupation Duty forces then in Germany, namely the 1st Infantry Division and the United States Constabulary (Note: By middle 1948 limited combat training had been restored in EUCOM). In December, 1950 President Truman’s declared National Emergency due to the Korean War included a 4 division augmentation of U.S. Forces in Europe, including the NG 28th and 43rd infantry divisions. In May 1951 the 4th Infantry Division arrived in United States Army Europe (USAREUR) in Germany, and on August 3, 1951, V Corps was reactivated and assigned to the Seventh Army in USAREUR. In July the 2d Armored Division arrived in Germany, and on August 25, 1951 the 4th Infantry Division (HQ: Frankfurt) and 2d Armored Division (HQ: Bad Kreuznach) were assigned as V Corps divisions. In November 1951 VII Corps {{was assigned to the}} Seventh Army, and the long serving U.S. Zone of Occupation division, the 1st Infantry Division (HQ: Wuerzburg), plus the newly arrived 28th Infantry Division and 43d Infantry Division, were assigned as its divisions. The Constabulary was inactivated upon the arrival of the four U.S. division <b>augmentation</b> <b>forces</b> to Germany. V Corps was assigned to the northern area of the U.S. Occupation Zone of Germany (which included the Fulda Gap), and the VII Corps was assigned to the southern area of the U.S. Zone (one of the National Guard divisions was stationed in the Munich area, and the other was between Munich and Stuttgart). Note: Several years later the newly forming West German Army displaced the GDP positions of some of the U.S. units stationed in the far southern area of West Germany. As a consequence, the U.S. units' GDP positions were moved further north, as was the U.S. VII Corps' wartime southern boundary line (even though the U.S. units remained in their original kasernes). This shifting action likely coincided with the same time frame as the Summer and Fall conversion of all Seventh Army units to the ROAD format.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} work {{on early}} detection of space launch vehicle failures {{that could lead to}} loss of control during ascent. The particular focus is on the Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) comprising First Stage of the Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV). Some of the most important failure modes leading to loss of vehicle control are caused by hot gases ejected from the SRM combustion chamber through a case breach, through a joint between SRM segments, through a nozzle joint, or through an igniter seal. These hot gases create lateral thrust augmentation, with the resulting tilting moment possibly leading to loss of control. By using Thrust Vector Control (TVC) gimballing of the main nozzle, the flight control system tries to counter any attitude disturbance, which could mask the moment augmentation till it overwhelms the TVC and the control authority is lost. The approach proposed and demonstrated in a medium-fidelity simulation of the rocket dynamics employs continuous model-based multivariable estimation and monitoring of the <b>augmentation</b> <b>forces</b> and moments for {{early detection of}} the failure. The computations are performed in two stages. First, a 6 -degree-of-freedom model of vehicle dynamics is used to compute the predicted vehicle accelerations.

40|$|This paper reports {{technical}} {{design of a}} novel experimental test facility, using haptic-enabled teleoperation of robotic manipulators, for live transmission line maintenance. The goal is to study and develop appropriate techniques in repair overhead power transmission lines by allowing linemen to wirelessly guide a remote manipulator, installed on a crane bucket, to execute dexterous maintenance tasks, such as twisting a tie wire around a cable. Challenges and solutions for developing such a system are outlined. The test facility consists of a PHANToM Desktop haptic device (master site), an industrial hydraulic manipulator (slave site) mounted atop a Stewart platform, and {{a wireless communication channel}} connecting the master and slave sites. The teleoperated system is tested under different force feedback schemes, while the base is excited and the communication channel is delayed and/or lossy to emulate realistic network behaviors. The force feedback schemes are: virtual fixture, <b>augmentation</b> <b>force</b> and augmented virtual fixture. Performance of each scheme is evaluated under three measures: task completion time, number of failed trials and displacement of the slave manipulator end-effector.

40|$|Activation of {{skeletal}} muscle twice {{in quick succession}} results in nonlinear force summation (i. e. doublet potentiation). The force contributed by a second activation is typically of augmented amplitude, longer in duration and generated at a greater rate. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine force summation in a muscle attached to a compliant tendon, where considerable internal shortening occurs during a fixed-end contraction. The triceps surae of 21 (Experiment 1) and nine (Experiment 2) young adults were maximally activated with doublet stimulation of different interstimulus intervals (ISIs) (5 - 100 ms) at several muscle lengths. Ultrasound images acquired from lateral gastrocnemius and soleus muscles allowed quantification of dynamic fascicle behavior. Force summation was muscle length-dependent. <b>Force</b> <b>augmentation</b> was limited to a short muscle length. Lateral gastrocnemius and soleus fascicles underwent large amounts of active shortening and achieved high velocities in response to doublet stimulation, dynamics unfavorable for force production. Summation amplitude and the sensitivity of summation to ISI were dramatically depressed in the triceps surae after comparison to muscles with less fixed-end compliance. We propose that the internal shortening permitted by high series compliance limited <b>force</b> <b>augmentation</b> by offsetting and/or interfering with activation and cross-bridge processes driving augmentation. High series compliance may also reduce the sensitivity of the summated response to ISI, an assertion supported by predictions from a Hill-type muscle model. These muscles may exhibit greater <b>force</b> <b>augmentation</b> during more accustomed stretch-shorten tasks (i. e. hopping), where the compliance of the Achilles tendon actually enables near-isometric fascicle behaviour...|$|R

Accordingly, the core strategic purpose of the Coast Guard Reserve is to maintain the competencies to perform three prioritized functions:(1) Maritime Homeland Security;(2) Domestic and expeditionary support to National Defense; and, (3) Domestic, natural or man-made, disaster response and recovery.Foremost, the Coast Guard Reserve must be ready for call-up at any time to provide surge capacity during such contingencies. Training, including normal drill periods and two-week annual active duty, will focus on building and honing the skills and knowledge required for these mobilization duties.Secondly, by virtue of full integration into shore-based units, reservists are available as an <b>augmentation</b> <b>force</b> for the continuum of traditional Coast Guard missions. Their employment in day-to-day operations should be structured to complement mobilization readiness requirements.Every commander, commanding officer, officer-in-charge and program manager of units where reservists are permanently or temporarily assigned is expected to provide leadership and oversight to keep those reservists trained and accessible for mobilization.
