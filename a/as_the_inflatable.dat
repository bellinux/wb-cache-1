40|$|A new {{procedure}} for generating smooth uniformly clustered three-dimensional structured elliptic grids is presented here which formulates three-dimensional boundary constraints by extending the two-dimensional counterpart 1 {{presented by the}} author earlier. This fully automatic procedure obviates the need for manual specification of decay parameters over the six bounding surfaces of a given volume grid. The procedure has been demonstrated here for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) geometries such as aeroshell and canopy, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>inflatable</b> aerodynamic decelerator (IAD) geometry. The new procedure also enables generation of single-zone grids for such geometries because the automatic boundary constraints permit the decay parameters to evolve {{as part of the}} solution to the elliptic grid system of equations. These decay parameters are no longer just constants, as specified in the conventional approach, but functions of generalized coordinate variables over a given bounding surface. Since these decay functions vary over...|$|E

Hiro declines an offer from Alistair Krei, CEO of Krei Tech, to market the microbots, and Callaghan accepts him into the school. When a fire breaks out among the exhibits, Tadashi rushes in to save Callaghan, but the building explodes moments later, apparently killing both Tadashi and Callaghan.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>inflatable</b> aeroshell design {{looks much}} like the aeroshell or blunt body design. <b>The</b> <b>inflatable</b> aeroshell is often {{referred}} to as a hybrid system, with a rigid nosepiece and an inflated, attached decelerator to increase the drag area. Just prior to entering <b>the</b> atmosphere, <b>the</b> <b>inflatable</b> aeroshell extends from a rigid nose-cap and provides a larger surface area to slow the spacecraft down. Made of thin-film material and reinforced with a ceramic cloth, <b>the</b> <b>inflatable</b> aeroshell design could offer many of the same advantages and functionality as trailing ballute designs. While not <b>as</b> large <b>as</b> <b>the</b> trailing ballute, <b>the</b> <b>inflatable</b> aeroshell is roughly three times larger than the rigid aeroshell system and performs the aerocapture maneuver higher in the atmosphere, reducing heating loads. Because <b>the</b> system is <b>inflatable,</b> <b>the</b> spacecraft is not enclosed during launch and cruise, which allows more flexibility during spacecraft design and operations.|$|R

40|$|A small-scale, {{instrumented}} research {{aircraft was}} flown {{to investigate the}} night characteristics of innersole wings. Ground tests measured the static structural characteristics of the wing at different inflation pressures, and these results compared favorably with analytical predictions. A research-quality instrumentation system was assembled, largely from commercial off-the-shelf components, and installed in the aircraft. Initial flight operations were conducted with a conventional rigid wing having the same dimensions <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>inflatable</b> wing. Subsequent flights were conducted with the inflatable wing. Research maneuvers were executed to identify the trim, aerodynamic performance, and longitudinal stability and control characteristics of the vehicle in its different wing configurations. For the angle-of-attack range spanned in this flight program, measured flight data demonstrated that the rigid wing was an effective simulator of the lift-generating capability of the inflatable wing. In-flight inflation of the wing was demonstrated in three flight operations, and measured flight data illustrated the dynamic characteristics during wing inflation and transition to controlled lifting flight. Wing inflation was rapid and the vehicle dynamics during inflation and transition were benign. The resulting angles of attack and of sideslip ere small, and the dynamic response was limited to roll and heave motions...|$|E
40|$|Provision {{of clean}} {{drinking}} water to poor can prevent {{a large number}} of deaths and illnesses amongst children around the world. In 2010, about 0. 75 million child deaths were caused due to diarrhea, and a further 22. 5 million years of life were lost due to ill-health, disability or early death caused by unimproved water and inadequate sanitation around the world. Most of these people live in regions with limited or no electricity, and abundance of sunshine and salt water or unclean water. Solar thermal distillation using solar stills is the most potent way of cleaning the salt water in the absence of electricity. Several products, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>inflatable</b> stills for life rafts, water-cone and water pyramid have been demonstrated for the purification of salt water. None of these is specifically targeting a single family. We found that simple ways of natural cooling improve the production considerably. Moreover, dripping from cleaned water from the condensing area reduced the production. A simple rule could be formulated that provides an estimate of the maximum length before dripping starts. With this a more clever design of the collection of clean water allows stills of larger scale that still produce efficiently. The work of this thesis we aim at a plastic based solar stills capable of providing at least 2. 5 liters/day of drinking water, an amount put forward by the UNICEF. The results are being used by Dr Ten B. V. {{for the development of a}} simple and replicable mass manufacturing process for plastic based stills. Future projects for the use of solar stills are under consideration with several governments and organizations like UNHC...|$|E
30|$|Each tibial plateau was {{fractured}} on {{both the}} medial and lateral sides. For comparison, all tibias underwent reduction of either the medial or lateral plateau with the balloon, and a conventional tamp was used on the contralateral side. For the conventional method, a small cortical window was made and a metal tamp was used to manually elevate the depression. With the balloon method, a working cannula was inserted parallel to the joint line in the metaphyseal bone. A trocar was passed to {{the midpoint of the}} tibia and withdrawn, leaving a path for balloon passage. The balloon was then inserted through the cannula and inflated, subsequently elevating the fracture. Ballon used was the Kyphon/Medtronic, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA. This device is known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inflatable</b> Bone Tamp (IBT). The IBT is designed to compress cancellous bone and/or move cortical bone as it inflates. It comprises three biocompatible parts: a proximal luer fitting, a central catheter, and a distal inflatable tip with radiopaque markers. Balloon inflation is achieved using an external inflation syringe filled with radiopaque dye. Fine-cut micro-computed tomography (CT) scans were performed on all intact specimens, following fracture, and again after being reduced. CT data ere used to quantify the fracture volume and displacement and the amount of restored normal anatomy. Data were used to judge restoration efficacy of the normal anatomy and to compare balloon efficacy to conventional methods. The same technique was used to create die-punch fractures of the distal radius. The height of the weight drop was altered to create different degrees of depression for comparison. Only the balloon technique was used to reduce distal radius fractures. The same CT scan protocol was used on all distal radius fractures to evaluate reduction efficacy.|$|E

40|$|NASA's human spaceflight {{program is}} focused on {{developing}} technologies to expand the reaches of human exploration and science activities beyond low earth orbit. A critical aspect of living in space or on planetary surfaces is habitation, which provides a safe and comfortable space in which humans can live and work. NASA is seeking out the best option for habitation by exploring several different concepts through the Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU) project. The purpose of this HDU {{is to develop a}} fully autonomous habitation system that enables human exploration of space. One critical feature of the HDU project that helps to accomplish its mission of autonomy is the instrumentation system that monitors key subsystems operating within a Habitat configuration. The following paper will discuss previous instrumentation systems used in analog habitat concepts and how the current instrumentation system being implemented on the HDU 1 -PEM, or pressurized excursion module, is building upon the lessons learned of those previous systems. Additionally, this paper will discuss the benefits and the limitations of implementing a wireless sensor network (WSN) as the basis for data transport in the instrumentation system. Finally, this paper will address the experiences and lessons learned with integration, testing prior to deployment, and field testing at the JSC rock yard. NASA is developing the HDU 1 -PEM as a step towards a fully autonomous habitation system that enables human exploration of space. To accomplish this purpose, the HDU project is focusing on development, integration, testing, and evaluation of habitation systems. The HDU will be used as a technology pull, testbed, and integration environment in which to advance NASA's understanding of alternative mission architectures, requirements, and operations concepts definition and validation. This project is a multi-year effort. In 2010, the HDU 1 -PEM will be in a pressurized excursion module configuration, and in 2011 the module will be reconfigured for a pressurized core module configuration. Each year the HDU configurations will undergo testing at NASA's Desert Research and Technology Studies (D-RaTS) in Arizona [1]. As part of this project, a modular instrumentation system is developed to meet the monitoring needs of the HDU subsystems and to integrate with the current command and data handling infrastructure that has been developed for the project. The main objective {{of this study is to}} provide for the monitoring needs of the HDU. The requirements necessary to meet this objective are developed by working with the subsystem managers of the HDU to understand their monitoring needs. Additionally, the instrumentation system design leverages knowledge and lessons learned from previous studies, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>inflatable</b> habitat health monitoring system that was deployed in Antarctica [2], the integrated health monitoring system developed for NASA's Microhab [3], and the JSC Lunar Habitat Wireless Testbed to demonstrate a "standardsbased" approach to a wireless instrumentation system [4]. The HDU also requires flexibility in reconfiguration options, and it is necessary to demonstrate and evaluate a modular approach to an instrumentation system. Thus, the instrumentation system is designed in two parts: the primary system employs a standard WSN configuration, and the secondary system employs a wired USB hub. The WSN design provides for reconfiguration or replacement of sensors due to malfunctions or upgrades by using a wireless node that accepts ten instrument inputs and wirelessly transmits the data to the command and data handling system. The USB hub is necessary for those instruments that operate using a wired USB connection, although the design attempts to limit the amount of sensors that need to be wired connections...|$|E

During the launch, the unpressurized Dragon Trunk will rapidly change from ground level atmospheric pressure to the vacuum of space. Since <b>the</b> <b>inflatable</b> habitat is tightly folded during launch with multiple layers of bladder, Kevlar fabric sections, and micro-meteoroid shielding, {{it was not possible}} to analyze or simulate how the residual air pockets would behave during the launch. If <b>the</b> <b>inflatable</b> habitat does not vent adequately and expands, it could rupture the payload bay of the launch vehicle. A launch depressurization test was chosen <b>as</b> <b>the</b> best way to qualify <b>the</b> <b>inflatable</b> habitat.
