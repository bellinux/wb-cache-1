40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of the apical {{apparatus and}} lateral ascus wall is compared in Leotia lubrica and five species currently {{placed in the}} Geoglossaceae. The lateral ascus wall consists of two layers, of which the inner one increases in thickness in the apical apparatus. Considerable differences in substructure of both layers are described. On the basis of general morphology of the apical apparatus, structure and PA-TCH-SP reactivity of the apical thickening and annulus, and occurrence of an <b>annular</b> <b>protrusion</b> four main categories are distinguished. A reactive annulus is demonstrated in the apical apparatus of all species, including L. lubrica. The species studied are arranged as follows: Category 1 a. Geoglossum nigritum and G. cookeianum; 1 b. Trichoglossum hirsutum; 2. Leotia lubrica; 3. Microglossum viride; 4. Mitrula paludosa. Most fundamental is considered {{the position of the}} annulus in the apical thickening, either fully (category 1) or partly (2 — 4) occupying the apical thickening, either associated with an <b>annular</b> <b>protrusion</b> (3, 4) or not (1, 2). The data on the ultrastructure of the ascus apical apparatus and lateral wall, and mode of dehiscence indicate that L. lubrica takes an isolated position, distant from the other Leotioideae (including Ombrophiloideae) and the Geoglossaceae. Geoglossum, Trichoglossum, and Microglossum can best be maintained as separate genera in the family Geoglossaceae. The ultrastructural data of M. paludosa indicate closer affinity with Sclerotiniaceae than with Geoglossaceae...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of the ascus apical apparatus {{is compared}} in 19 {{species of the}} Hymenoscyphoideae, currently placed in seven genera. The ascus wall consists of an outer layer of two strata, and an inner layer of also two, and in one species of three strata. At the apex only the inner layer increases in thickness. On {{the basis of the}} general morphology and PA-TCH-SP reactivity pattern of the apex five main groups are recognized. A further division into subgroups is also outlined. The most important diagnostic features used in the analysis are the relative development and the reactivity pattern of the apical thickening, the occurrence of an <b>annular</b> <b>protrusion,</b> the structure and the reactivity pattern of the annulus, and the apex maturation pattern. In addition to the electron micrographs diagrammatic schemes are given to illustrate the author’s interpretation. The species studied are thus arranged as follows: Group 1 a. Hymenoscyphus caudatus, H. fructigenus, H. salicellus, H. salicinus, and Bisporella pallescens; 1 b. H. imberbis and Phaeohelotium subcarneum; 1 c. H. consobrinus, H. repandus, and Crocicreas pallidum; 1 d. Discinella boudieri; Group 2 a. H. herbarum; 2 b. Pezizella gemmarum; 2 c. Chlorociboria aeruginascens and Pezizella alniella; 2 d. Crocicreas cyathoideum [var. cyathoideum]; Group 3. Bisporella sulfurina; Group 4. Cudoniella clavus var. grandis; Group 5. Cudoniella acicularis. Most fundamental are considered firstly the position of the annulus in the apical thickening, either partly (groups 1, 2, 4, 5) or fully (3) occupying the thickening, either associated (2, 4, 5) or not associated with an <b>annular</b> <b>protrusion</b> (1), and secondly the dehiscence mechanism, either an eversion of the annulus over an angle of about 90 ° (1, 2, 3 ?, 4) or a twostep mechanism (5) previously undescribed in Leotiales. The absence of an amyloid reaction in the apex, which is a diagnostic feature in Cudoniella acicularis and C. clavus var. grandis, is based on two fundamentally different structures in these species. The apex in the last mentioned fungus closely resembles that in Ombrophila violacea, while the apex in C. acicularis is unique in general morphology and dehiscence mechanism. The ultrastructural data of the apical apparatus are found to correlate with characters of excipulum anatomy, especially in the genera Hymenoscyphus and Bisporella. Their importance in segregating more natural genera from large ill-defined genera like Hymenoscyphus or Pezizella is discussed...|$|E
