5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{political}} <b>affiliation</b> in the Senate {{in the most}} recent era is distinct in several key respects from what has been the case historically. Since November 4, 2015, there has been no government caucus in the Senate because the Senate Liberal Caucus is not affiliated with the governing Liberal Party of Canada. On December 6, 2016, {{for the first time in}} Canadian history the number of senators without a partisan <b>affiliation</b> exceeded that of the largest caucus of senators with a partisan <b>affiliation.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{refusal to}} grant <b>affiliation</b> caused a bitter row to ensue that showed little sign of being resolved. Despite {{not having the}} support of the {{governing}} body, the new league continued their plans regardless. No <b>affiliation</b> would have meant that the clubs would have problems attaining work permits for their signings and finding officials to referee their matches. The row also threatened the future of the Nottingham Panthers, as the National Ice Centre were reluctant to allow a team from an unaffiliated league hire their arena. The issue was resolved in August 2003 when the Panthers and the NIC announced an icetime agreement. The EIHL finally agreed <b>affiliation</b> in August 2003, with only weeks to go before the beginning of the new season.|$|E

40|$|The strong {{corporate}} <b>affiliations</b> in Japan {{have been}} cited {{as one of the}} major impediments to making the fundamental changes necessary to escape the economic malaise that has afflicted the Japanese economy over the past decade. While Japanese corporate <b>affiliations</b> during good economic times were heralded as an effective way to increase credit availability and reduce agency costs, during difficult economic circumstances these same <b>affiliations</b> may impede needed economic restructuring, insofar as they insulate firms from the market discipline that otherwise would be imposed by creditors. This paper shows that corporate <b>affiliations</b> have contributed to significant misallocations of credit, since troubled borrowers with strong corporate <b>affiliations</b> with their lenders are more likely to obtain additional credit than their healthier brethren. In contrast, lenders that are not affiliated with the firm are much less likely to extend additional credit as firms become more troubled...|$|R

40|$|Executives are `affiliated' if they {{previously}} worked for their companies' audit firms. I find most <b>affiliations</b> (71. 3 %) occur when auditors become employees of audit clients ('employment affiliations'), but <b>affiliations</b> also arise when companies hire executives' former CPA firms ('alma mater affiliations'). Affiliated companies are {{significantly more likely}} than unaffiliated companies to receive clean audit opinions-this finding holds for both employment and alma mater <b>affiliations.</b> Executive turnover is significantly lower for affiliated executives than for unaffiliated executives following the issuance of clean audit opinions-this suggests companies perceive <b>affiliations</b> are more valuable after they receive clean audit opinions. © 2004 Elsevier B.
