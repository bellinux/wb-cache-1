50|$|Straightening {{abnormal}} twists {{of the leg}} bones, i.e. femur (termed femoral <b>anteversion</b> or antetorsion) and tibia (tibial torsion). This is {{a secondary}} complication caused by the spastic muscles generating abnormal forces on the bones, and often results in intoeing (pigeon-toed gait). The surgery is called derotation osteotomy, in which the bone is broken (cut) and then set in the correct alignment.|$|E
50|$|Planning of {{the neck}} design on the Unique stem is {{computerized}} with digital templates, and the surgeon can access all data regarding his patients on the Internet. In that way the surgeon can himself/herself make the necessary adjustments of rotation point, <b>anteversion,</b> medial offset etc. from his/her own computer - it be at the office or at home, and when the surgeon is satisfied with the design it will be manufactured.|$|E
50|$|While {{the lifting}} methods can induce a flexing of the spine, this rolling method can be {{hazardous}} for several reasons: {{the risk of}} a torsion of the spine when rolling, the risk when sliding the casualty on the mattress, the risk of <b>anteversion</b> of the hips (and thus of flexing of the spine) due to the weight of the legs when lifting the mattress to slide the board.|$|E
5000|$|Rarely, {{a sharply}} tilted uterus {{is due to}} a disease such as endometriosis, an {{infection}} or prior surgery. Although this may make it more challenging for the sperm to reach the egg, conception can still occur. [...] A tipped uterus will usually right itself during the 10th to 12th week of pregnancy. Rarely (1 in 3000 to 8000 pregnancies) a tipped uterus will cause painful and difficult urination, and can cause severe urinary retention. Treatment for this condition (called [...] "incarcerated uterus") includes manual <b>anteversion</b> of the uterus, and usually requires intermittent or continuous catheter drainage of the bladder until the problem is rectified or spontaneously resolves by the natural enlargement of the uterus, which brings it out of the tipped position. In addition to manual <b>anteversion</b> and bladder drainage, treatment of urinary retention due to retroverted uterus can require the use of a pessary, or even surgery, but often is as simple as having the pregnant mother sleep on her stomach for a day or two, to allow the retroverted uterus to move forward.|$|E
50|$|Some hip muscles also act {{on either}} the knee joint or on {{vertebral}} joints. Additionally, because the area of origin and insertion {{of many of these}} muscles are very extensive, these muscles are often involved in several very different movements. In the hip joint, lateral and medial rotation occur along the axis of the limb; extension (also called dorsiflexion or retroversion) and flexion (anteflexion or <b>anteversion)</b> occur along a transverse axis; and abduction and adduction occur about a sagittal axis.|$|E
50|$|Pigeon toe (also {{known as}} {{metatarsus}} varus, metatarsus adductus, in-toe gait, intoeing or false clubfoot) {{is a condition}} which causes the toes to point inward when walking. It is most common in infants and children under two years of age and, when {{not the result of}} simple muscle weakness, normally arises from underlying conditions, such as a twisted shin bone or an excessive <b>anteversion</b> (femoral head is more than 15° from the angle of torsion) resulting in the twisting of the thigh bone when the front part of a person's foot is turned in.|$|E
5000|$|The human leg, in {{the general}} meaning, is the entire lower limb of the human body, {{including}} the foot, thigh and even the hip or gluteal region. However, the definition in human anatomy refers only to {{the section of the}} lower limb extending from the knee to the ankle, also known as the crus. [...] Legs are used for standing, and all forms of locomotion including recreational such as dancing, and constitute a significant portion of a person's mass. Female legs generally have greater hip <b>anteversion</b> and tibiofemoral angles, but shorter femur and tibial lengths than those in males.|$|E
50|$|All {{three parts}} {{described}} above pull the scapula forward around the thorax, which {{is essential for}} <b>anteversion</b> of the arm. As such, the muscle is an antagonist to the rhomboids. However, when the inferior and superior parts act together, they keep the scapula pressed against the thorax together with the rhomboids and therefore these parts also act as synergists to the rhomboids. The inferior part can pull {{the lower end of}} the scapula laterally and forward and thus rotates the scapula to make elevation of the arm possible. Additionally, all three parts can lift the ribs when the shoulder girdle is fixed, and thus assist in respiration.|$|E
5000|$|The uterus is in {{the middle}} of the pelvic cavity in frontal plane (due to ligamentum latum uteri). The fundus does not surpass the linea terminalis, while the vaginal part of the cervix does not extend below interspinal line. The uterus is mobile and moves posteriorly under the {{pressure}} of a full bladder, or anteriorly under the pressure of a full rectum. If both are full, it moves upwards. Increased intraabdominal pressure pushes it downwards. The mobility is conferred to it by musculo-fibrous apparatus that consists of suspensory and sustentacular part. Under normal circumstances the suspensory part keeps the uterus in anteflexion and <b>anteversion</b> (in 90% of women) and keeps it [...] "floating" [...] in the pelvis. The meaning of these terms are described below:pelvic diaphragm in the back and the smaller urogenital diaphragm in the front.|$|E
40|$|Combined cup {{and stem}} <b>anteversion</b> in THA based on femoral <b>anteversion</b> has been {{suggested}} as a method to compensate for abnormal femoral <b>anteversion.</b> We investigated the combined <b>anteversion</b> technique using computer navigation. In 47 THAs, the surgeon first estimated the femoral broach <b>anteversion</b> and validated the position by computer navigation. The broach was then measured with navigation. The navigation screen was blocked while the surgeon estimated the <b>anteversion</b> of the broach. This provided two estimates of stem <b>anteversion.</b> The navigated stem <b>anteversion</b> was validated by postoperative CT scans. All cups were implanted using navigation alone. We determined precision (the reproducibility) and bias (how close the average test number is to the true value) of the stem position. Comparing the surgeon estimate to navigation <b>anteversion,</b> the precision of the surgeon was 16. 8 ° and bias was 0. 2 °; comparing the navigation of the stem to postoperative CT <b>anteversion,</b> the precision was 4. 8 ° and bias was 0. 2 °, meaning navigation is accurate. Combined <b>anteversion</b> by postoperative CT scan was 37. 6 ° ±  7 ° (standard deviation) (range, 19 °– 50 °). The combined <b>anteversion</b> with computer navigation was within the safe zone of 25 ° to 50 ° for 45 of 47 (96 %) hips. Femoral stem <b>anteversion</b> had a wide variability...|$|E
40|$|Several studies {{support the}} concept that, for optimum {{range of motion}} in THA, the {{combined}} femoral and acetabular <b>anteversion</b> should be some constant or fall within some “safe zone. ” When using a cementless femoral component, the surgeon has little control of the <b>anteversion</b> of the component since it is dictated by native femoral <b>anteversion.</b> Given this constraint, we asked whether the surgeon should use the native <b>anteversion</b> of the acetabulum as a target for implant position in THA. Forty-six patients scheduled for primary THA underwent CT scanning and preoperative planning using a computer workstation. The native acetabular <b>anteversion</b> and the native femoral <b>anteversion</b> were measured. Prosthetic femoral <b>anteversion</b> was measured on the workstation by three-dimensional templating of a straight-stemmed tapered implant. The mean of {{the sum of the}} native acetabular <b>anteversion</b> and native femoral <b>anteversion</b> was 28. 9 °; however, 17 % varied by 10 ° to 15 ° and 11 % by more than 15 °. The mean of native femoral <b>anteversion</b> and prosthetic femoral <b>anteversion</b> was 13. 8 ° (range, − 6. 1 °– 32. 7 °) and 22. 5 ° (range, 1 °– 39 °), respectively.

40|$|Background: Excessive <b>anteversion</b> or {{retroversion}} of femoral component {{may cause}} arthroplasty to become unstable. Method: In this study, we calculated the <b>anteversion</b> {{angle of the}} femoral neck in thirty non operated (control) hips on both sides by biplanar roentgenography and using the average angle obtained as standard, compared the <b>anteversion</b> angle of the femoral component in thirty patients (both males and females) who had undergone total hip arthroplasty (cemented or uncemented) through anterior and posterior approaches. Results: The average femoral <b>anteversion</b> angle in hips that had undergone total hip replacement through the posterior approach was 18. 18 degrees which closely paralleled that of the controls which was 16. 31 degrees suggesting that the operating surgeon had a better control over femoral neck <b>anteversion</b> through the posterior approach than the anterior approach in which the average <b>anteversion</b> angle was 9. 3607 degrees.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{recommended}} range of <b>anteversion</b> {{of the components}} in total hip arthroplasty (THA) is between 10 and 30 °, but the intraoperative estimation of these versions may be inadequate. HypothesisThe components <b>anteversion</b> in primary cementless THA using straight stem and hemispherical cup is {{not significantly different from}} the native <b>anteversion</b> of the hip joint. ObjectivesTo evaluate in a prospective manner the range of <b>anteversion</b> currently achieved in cementless THA. Patients and methodsFive senior surgeons operated 91 patients with primary cementless THA. We used a straight press fit stem and a hemispherical press fit cup. We aimed to obtain femoral <b>anteversion</b> of 10 to 30 °, acetabular <b>anteversion</b> of 10 to 30 ° and a global combined <b>anteversion</b> of 25 to 55 °. Cup position was checked with an impactor-positioner, and stem position was determined with the knee flexed 90 °. In all cases we used elevated liners and 28 mm diameter ceramic heads. At 3 months postoperatively the component versions were measured using a General Electric LightSpeed Pro 16 (Milwaukee, Wi, USA) with the patient in supine position. ResultsFemoral component measurements ranged from 17 ° of retroversion to 60 ° of <b>anteversion</b> with a mean of 23. 0 ± 11. 8 °. Similarly, acetabular component version ranged from 28 ° of retroversion to 46 ° of <b>anteversion</b> with a mean of 18. 5 ± 13. 7 °. There were no correlations to the native femoral and acetabular versions. Only 55 hips (60. 4 %) were within the accepted range of 25 to 55 ° of combined <b>anteversion,</b> but none of the cases dislocated during a follow-up of 2 years. ConclusionIn cementless THA with our operative technique, the intraoperative estimation of femoral and acetabular <b>anteversion,</b> in many cases, resulted to be inadequate in relation to the intended range of 10 to 30 ° of <b>anteversion.</b> Level of evidenceLevel III, prospective diagnostic...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: {{the present}} {{feasibility}} {{study examined the}} use of an ultrasound-based navigation system (UNS) for reliability of measurement the positions of both the femoral and acetabular components, a prerequisite to adjust the combined <b>anteversion</b> with sufficient accuracy when using a femur-first approach in total hip arthroplasty. Method: using a UNS, five investigators performed five measurements of the posterior femoral condyles and the anterior pelvic planes (APP) of two cadavers with different body mass index. Deviations in stem and acetabular <b>anteversion</b> resulting from varying acquisition of the respective landmarks were determined relative to the reference measures of <b>anteversion</b> determined in the same cadavers from computed tomography (CT) scans. Here, both a freehand and guided ultrasound measurement methods were used to acquire the posterior femoral condyles. Femoral and acetabular <b>anteversion</b> values were added in order to estimate the combined <b>anteversion</b> of the reconstructed hip. Results: using an UNS, variations in the freehand technique for the acquisition of the posterior femoral condyles resulted in a mean error in the <b>anteversion</b> of the femoral component of - 1. 5 degrees (SD 3. 4 degrees; - 10. 8 degrees to 7. 0 degrees) while the mean error was - 0. 9 degrees (SD 3. 1 degrees; - 7. 3 degrees to 10. 2 degrees) when the UNS provided additional support to standardize the orientation of the UNS probe. In all cases, UNS navigation enabled to achieve combined <b>anteversion</b> values that fell within a clinically acceptable error range of less than +/- 12. 5 degrees compared to the CT measures. Conclusion: our investigations suggest that the <b>anteversion</b> of stem and cup can be measured with accuracy sufficient enough to utilize the concept of combined <b>anteversion</b> using UNS. Hence, the advantage of utilizing UNS's in a femur-first approach is the ability to intraoperatively compensate for deviations from the targeted <b>anteversion</b> of the stem (which is often difficult to control) by adjusting the acetabular <b>anteversion</b> in the final step of the implantation. In doing so, the placement of the components follows the concept of combined <b>anteversion.</b> Avoiding extreme <b>anteversion</b> values of combined <b>anteversion</b> could be an important step towards reducing post-operative complications following total hip arthroplasty (THA...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} femoral neck <b>anteversion</b> on bone mineral density (BMD) and {{geometry}} {{as measured by}} dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was assessed using 64 right proximal femora from 36 male and 28 female cadavers. The <b>anteversion</b> angle was measured on computed tomography (CT) images, and DXA measurements were made both in the neutral position (i. e, at 0 degree <b>anteversion,</b> femoral neck axis parallel to the table) and in the simulated anteverted position (i. e., femoral shaft axis parallel to the table, greater and lesser trochanters {{in contact with the}} table, and femoral neck free). The mean <b>anteversion</b> angle measured by CT was 19. 3 degrees (range 6 degrees- 38 degrees). <b>Anteversion</b> was associated with a significant elevation in femoral neck BMD of + 2. 8 % (range - 5. 3 %-(+) 9. 8 %) (p < 0. 05), and the femoral neck BMD increased with increasing <b>anteversion</b> (p < 0. 01). Trochanteric BMD was less affected by <b>anteversion,</b> with an average increase of only 0. 2 % (range - 5 %- 5. 9 %) (p = n. s.) in the anteverted position, but there was a significant positive association between the change in trochanteric BMD and the <b>anteversion</b> angle (p < 0. 01). <b>Anteversion</b> produced a mean reduction of - 2. 4 % (range - 7. 6 %-(+) 4. 3 %) (p < 0. 001) in apparent femoral neck axis length, while femoral neck width remained generally unaffected. These data confirm that femoral BMD as measured by DXA is affected by femoral <b>anteversion</b> with a lesser magnitude than previously reported. The use of trochanteric BMD may minimize the influence of <b>anteversion.</b> While the mean changes in BMD and neck axis length attributable to <b>anteversion</b> are modest, the considerable interindividual variability in the magnitude of the effects demonstrates that other factors, such as, the complex geometry of femoral neck modifies the effect of <b>anteversion</b> on BMD measurements. The error in BMD introduced femoral <b>anteversion</b> may represent a significant confounding influence in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Careful repositioning of the foot and leg is essential in monitoring changes in BMD longitudinally. Knowledge of the effects of femoral <b>anteversion</b> may assist in understanding the relation of femoral BMD and neck axis length to hip fracture. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|Although {{the angle}} {{measurements}} may not appear large, when related to femoral neck <b>anteversion</b> angle, whose average was 20.4 ° in our cases, they are significant.

40|$|The {{measurements}} of the angle of <b>anteversion</b> of the femoral neck by ultrasound scanning is described.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The adverse {{consequences}} of impingement, dislocation, and implant wear have stimulated increasing interest in accurate component orientation in {{total hip arthroplasty}} and hip resurfacing. The aims {{of the present study}} were to define femoral and acetabular orientation in a cohort of patients with primary hip osteoarthritis and to determine whether the orientation of their native hip joints corresponded with established recommendations for implantation of prosthetic components. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated a consecutive series of 131 preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans of patients with primary end-stage hip osteoarthritis (fifty-seven male and seventy-four female patients; mean age, sixty years). Patients were positioned according to a standardized protocol. Accounting for pelvic tilt, three-dimensional acetabular orientation was determined in the anatomical reference frame. Moreover, three-dimensional femoral version was measured. Differences in native anatomy between male and female patients were assessed with use of nonparametric tests. Native anatomy was evaluated with reference to the "safe zone" as described by Lewinnek et al. and to a "safe" combined <b>anteversion</b> of 20 ° to 40 °. RESULTS: In the entire cohort, the mean femoral <b>anteversion</b> was 13 ° and the mean acetabular <b>anteversion</b> was 19 °. No significant differences in femoral, acetabular, or combined (femoral and acetabular) <b>anteversion</b> were observed between male and female patients. The mean acetabular inclination was 62 °. There {{was no significant difference in}} acetabular inclination between female and male patients. We did not observe a correlation among acetabular inclination, acetabular <b>anteversion,</b> and femoral <b>anteversion.</b> Ninety-five percent (125) of the native acetabula were classified as being within the safe <b>anteversion</b> zone, whereas only 15 % (nineteen) were classified as being within the safe inclination zone. Combined <b>anteversion</b> was within the safe limits in 63 % (eighty-three) of the patients. However, only 8 % (ten) of the cases in the present cohort met the criteria of both "safe zone" definitions (that of Lewinnek et al. and combined <b>anteversion).</b> CONCLUSIONS: Acetabular <b>anteversion</b> of the osteoarthritic hip as defined by the native acetabular rim typically matches the recommended component "targets" for cup insertion. There was no specific relationship among native acetabular inclination, acetabular <b>anteversion,</b> and femoral <b>anteversion.</b> Neither native acetabular inclination nor native combined <b>anteversion</b> appears to be related to current implant insertion targets.
