40|$|Abstract—Besides their {{intended}} use in radionavigation, {{global positioning system}} (GPS) satellite signals provide convenient radio beacons for ionospheric studies. Among other propagation phe-nomena, the ionosphere affects GPS signal propagation through amplitude scintillations that develop after radio waves propagate through ionospheric electron density irregularities. This paper out-lines the design, testing, and operation of a specialized GPS re-ceiver to monitor L-band amplitude scintillations: the Cornell scin-tillation <b>monitor.</b> The Cornell <b>scintillation</b> <b>monitor</b> consists of a commercial GPS receiver development kit with its software modi-fied to log signal strength from up to 12 channels at a high data rate (50 samples/s). Other features of the receiver include the optional assignment of a channel to monitor the receiver noise level {{in the absence of}} signal tracking and the means to synchronize measure-ments between nearby independent receivers to perform drift mea-surements and correlation studies. The Cornell scintillation mon-itor provides characterization of the operational L-band scintilla-tion environment and additionally permits study of the multipath environment of a static antenna. GPS <b>scintillation</b> <b>monitors</b> can provide information about the state of ionospheric irregularities for pure research purposes as well. Here their strength {{lies in the fact that}} they are inexpensive and compact and therefore can be readily proliferated. Even a single <b>scintillation</b> <b>monitor</b> can supple-ment radar spatial coverage of irregularities in a limited way be-cause it monitors several satellite lines of sight simultaneously.

The traditional method of <b>monitoring</b> and mitigating <b>scintillation</b> is to transform commercial GPS receiver with modified hardware and embedded software. To better facilitate advance development GPS receiver under different condition, GPS software scintillation receiver is designed in this paper. The hardware scheme of high-speed GPS signal acquisition system is first discussed and implemented with FPGA and DSP architecture. Then, we describe receiver software processing algorithm, particularly the portion involving the scintillation signal acquisition and tracking, ionospheric scintillation index extracting and <b>scintillation</b> <b>monitoring.</b> The performance of software receiver is demonstrated under scintillation conditions. Relevant results show that software-receiver based approach can avoid weak signal loss and extract effectively ionospheric scintillation parameter compared with the traditional extracting method.

40|$|Strong ionospheric {{electron}} content gradients {{may lead}} to fast and unpredictable fluctuations in the phase and amplitude of the signals from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). This phenomenon, known as ionospheric scintillation, is capable of deteriorating the tracking performance of a GNSS receiver, leading to increased phase and Doppler errors, cycle slips and also to complete losses of signal lock. In order to mitigate scintillation effects at receiver level, the robustness of the carrier tracking loop, the receiver weakest link under scintillation, must be enhanced. Kalman Filter (KF) based tracking algorithms are particularly suitable {{to cope with the}} variable working conditions imposed by scintillation. However, the effectiveness of this tracking approach strongly depends on the accuracy of the assumed dynamic model, which can quickly become inaccurate under randomly variable situations. This study first shows how inaccurate dynamic models can lead to a KF suboptimum solution or divergence, when both strong phase and amplitude scintillation are present. Then, to overcome this issue, it proposes two self-tuning KF based carrier tracking algorithms, which self-tune their dynamic models by exploiting the knowledge about scintillation that can be achieved through <b>scintillation</b> <b>monitoring.</b> The algorithms have been assessed with live equatorial data affected by strong scintillation.

30|$|The ionospheric scintillation-induced error {{depends on}} the {{transfer}} function of the particular architecture of the receiver utilised. Hence, different receivers may respond differently to the same ionospheric scintillation event, particularly in the strong scintillation regime where nonlinearity appears.

The receiver-dependent response allows tuning of the receivers parameters, in order to maximise the tracking {{in the presence of}} ionospheric scintillation, similarly to what is done in ground-based GPS <b>scintillation</b> <b>monitors</b> (van Dierendonck et al. 1993). In the particular case of Swarm, the tracking bandwidths have been widened in an attempt to increase the robustness against scintillation.
