The authors detail the inverse problem and its general eigen-function and introduce an optimization method to obtain boundary conditions by known geometries in a discrete domain and the lowest propagating frequencies and their corresponding attenuations.

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{analytical model}} is presented for calculating the longitudinal acoustic modes of idealized "dump-type" ramjet engines. The model contains the matching required {{to place an}} oscillating flame sheet {{in the interior of}} a combustion chamber with mean flow. The linear coupling of the acoustic and entropy waves at the inlet shock, flame sheet, and exit nozzle along with <b>acoustic</b> <b>admittances</b> at the inlet and exit are combined to determine the stability of the system as well as the acoustic modes. Since the acoustic and entropy waves travel at different velocities, the geometry is a critical factor in determining stability. Typical values of the admittances will produce damped solutions when the entropy is neglected, but, as the ratio of the entropy to acoustic fluctuations is increased, the coupling can either feed acoustic energy into or out of different modes independently.

The technique {{is based on a}} standard laboratory de-watering apparatus coupled with a standard acoustic impedance tube. The dependence of the surface admittance on the degree of water saturation is investigated for two samples of sand with widely different flow resistivities. It is shown that a relatively small change (e. g., from 0 % to 11 % by volume) in the degree of water saturation can result in a much larger change (e. g., twofold) in the <b>acoustic</b> surface <b>admittance.</b> An empirical relationship is found between the peaks observed in the real part of admittance spectra for the low flow resistivity sand and the degree of water saturation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative experimental approach for simultaneous {{measurements of the}} suction head, volumetric water content, and the <b>acoustic</b> <b>admittance</b> of unsaturated sands. Samples of unsaturated sands are tested under controlled laboratory conditions. Several types of uniform sand {{with a wide range}} of particle sizes are investigated. The reported experiments are based on a standard Buchner funnel setup and a standard acoustic impedance tube. It is a novel, nondestructive, and noninvasive technique that relates the key geotechnical parameters of sands such as volumetric water content, density, and grain-size distribution to the <b>acoustic</b> <b>admittance</b> and attenuation. The results show a very sensitive dependence of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>admittance</b> on the volumetric water content controlled by the value of suction head applied. Analysis of the obtained data demonstrates that the relationship between the volumetric water content and the real part of the surface admittance in the frequency range of 400 – 1, 200 Hz can be represented using a logarithmic equation. It is found that the coefficients in the proposed equation are directly related to the uniformity coefficient and the <b>acoustic</b> <b>admittance</b> of the dry sample, which can easily be measured or predicted for a broad range of sands. A validation exercise is conducted to examine the accuracy of the proposed equation using a sand sample with markedly different properties. The results of the validation exercise demonstrate that the proposed relations can be used to determine very accurately the volumetric water content within the porous specimen from the acoustical data. The error in the acoustically measured volumetric water content is found to be ± 2. 0 % over the full range of volumetric water contents (0 ≤θ≤n, where n is the sample porosity) ...|$|E

Participants were 170 healthy neonates (96 boys and 74 girls) aged between 1 and 6 days (mean = 3. 26 days, SD = 0. 92). Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), and 226 Hz and 1000 Hz probe tone tympanograms {{were obtained from the}} participants using a Madsen Capella OAE/middle ear analyser.

40|$|The sand cat, {{one species}} of the cat family, is found only in deserts and has unusually large ear canals and middle-ear air cavities. Recent work has shown that sand cat ears absorb {{acoustic}} power at low frequencies (< 1 kHz) better than those of domestic cats (Huang et al. 2002). In this thesis, we test this hypothesis by comparing <b>acoustic</b> input- <b>admittance,</b> which determines <b>acoustic</b> power absorption, and thresholds of auditory- brainstem responses. In a zoo, measurements were made in 37 ears of 23 anesthetized specimens, including sand cats and five other felid species.

40|$|Current methodologies for characterizing tympanic {{membrane}} (TM) motion are usually limited to either average <b>acoustic</b> estimates (<b>admittance</b> or reflectance) or single-point mobility measurements, {{neither of which}} suffices to characterize the detailed mechanical response of the TM to sound. Furthermore, while acoustic and single-point measurements may aid in diagnosing some middle-ear disorders, they are not always useful. Measurements of {{the motion of the}} entire TM surface can provide more information than these other techniques and may be superior for diagnosing pathology. We present advances in our development of a new compact optoelectronic holographic otoscope (OEHO) system for full field-of-view characterization of nanometer-scale sound-induced displacements of the TM surface at video rates. The OEHO system consists of a fiber optic subsystem, a compact otoscope head, and a high-speed image processing computer with advanced software for recording and processing holographic images coupled to a computer-controlled sound-stimulation and recording system. A prototype OEHO system is in use in a medical research environment to address basic science questions regarding TM function. The prototype provides real-time observation of sound-induced TM displacement patterns over a broad frequency range.

Research completed at the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, College of Health ProfessionsTympanometry is a physiological measurement of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>admittance</b> in sound transmission through the ear canal and middle ear and has been widely used in audiology as an objective and non-invasive means to determine {{the function of the}} middle ear system. A graphic display of the measurement is called a tympanogram. Characteristics of tympanograms have been quantified with several measures, e. g., peak compensated static <b>acoustic</b> <b>admittance</b> (Ytm) and equivalent ear canal volume (Vec). In the past decades, numerous investigations confirmed the effect of several middle-ear pathologies on tympanometric measures. However, little effort has been made to specifically explore the effect of negative middle-ear pressure. The objective {{of the present study was}} to present the outcomes of two tympanometric measures (Ytm and Vec) in human ears with negative middle ear pressure. Data was obtained from 77 patients' records (96 ears) at the Wichita State University Speech-Language-Hearing Clinic. Results demonstrate that substantial overlap exists in both Ytm and Vec measures of tympanometry between the ears with negative middle ear pressures and those with normal pressure in previous studies. These measures are unlikely useful to serve as an index in the diagnosis of negative middle ear pressure in humans. The present study also suggests that both Ytm and Vec tend to decrease with decreasing negative middle ear pressure...|$|E

With this model, strong gas phase resonance has been found in certain cases at the characteristic gas-phase frequencies, but the peaking of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>admittance</b> is in the direction favoring the damping of pressure waves.

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{analytical model}} is presented for calculating the longitudinal acoustic modes of idealized "dump-type" ramjet engines. The geometry considered is the coaxial flow type with {{the inlet flow}} opening to the combustor at a simple dump plane. Since the frequencies are very low, the dominant modes are the one-dimensional longitudinal modes and allow the predictions to be extended to more complicated geometries (such as side dump combustors) with good success. A plane flame has been studied and incorporated into the combustor model where the flame is allowed to move or oscillate in the combustor. This provides three mechanisms of interaction at the flame sheet: change in mean temperature in the combustor, energy conversion at the sheet due to upstream fluctuations, and fluctuating heat release. A supersonic inlet upstream contains a shock wave in its diffuser section while the downstream exit is terminated by a choked nozzle. The linear coupling of the acoustic and entropy waves at the inlet shock, flame sheet, and exit nozzle along with <b>acoustic</b> <b>admittances</b> at the inlet and exit are combined to determine {{the stability of the}} system as well as the acoustic modes. Since the acoustic and entropy waves travel at different velocities, the geometry is a critical factor in determining stability. Typical values of the admittances will produce damped solutions when the entropy is neglected, but, as the ratio of the entropy to acoustic fluctuations is increased, the coupling can either feed acoustic energy into or out of different modes independently. This transfer of energy has a destabilizing or stabilizing effect on the acoustic modes of the system depending on the relative phases between the acoustic and entropy waves. In the linear case, the entropy and acoustics are decoupled in the flow field. All linear coupling occurs at the boundary conditions. For cases where the entropy fluctuations are of the same order of magnitude as the pressure oscillations and the coupling is of comparable order, the linear stability of the acoustic field is strongly dependent upon the entropy fluctuations. The linear acoustics are predominantly governed by the boundary conditions; thus it is imperative that the entire system of inlet, combustor, and exit be considered together to determine the characteristic eigenvalues (resonant frequencies) and eigenfunctions (mode shapes). In addition, there are two modes of acoustic pressure oscillations: the classical acoustic mode and the entropy-induced mode of pressure oscillation. The nonlinear case treats the quadratic nonlinear fluid mechanic interactions in the coupling of two acoustic modes. The result is that the nonlinear acoustic-entropy interactions are much smaller than the acoustic-acoustic interactions for this case. Hence, the nonlinear acoustic field is influenced by the nonuniform entropy only by its dependence upon the linear solution which can be strongly dependent upon the entropy. The energy in the acoustics of this model is controlled by the energy loss (gain) at the boundaries balanced with the energy gain (loss) at the flame front. Acoustic energy is typically lost at both the inlet and exit, but fluctuating entropy waves convecting with the mean flow velocity that impinge upon a choked nozzle generate acoustic waves that can, under the proper conditions, feed acoustic energy into the system. In addition, the Rayleigh condition for driving the system with a fluctuating heat release can also contribute to the stability of the system. The plane flame mechanism also contributes to the acoustic energy from the interaction of entropy and acoustic waves at a flame sheet. This allows a systematic study of the influence of entropy-acoustic wave interactions on the linear stability and modes of this combustor system...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} method {{for the analysis}} of longitudinal-mode liquid rocket combustion instability has been developed based on the unsteady, quasi-one-dimensional Euler equations where the combustion process source terms were introduced through the incorporation of a two-zone, linearized representation: (1) A two-parameter collapsed combustion zone at the injector face, and (2) a two-parameter distributed combustion zone based on a Lagrangian treatment of the propellant spray. The unsteady Euler equations in inhomogeneous form retain full hyperbolicity and are integrated implicitly in time using second-order, high-resolution, characteristic-based, flux-differencing spatial discretization with Roe-averaging of the Jacobian matrix. This method was initially validated against an analytical solution for nonreacting, isentropic duct <b>acoustics</b> with specified <b>admittances</b> at the inflow and outflow boundaries. For small amplitude perturbations, numerical predictions for the amplification coefficient and oscillation period were found to compare favorably with predictions from linearized small-disturbance theory as long as the grid exceeded a critical density (100 nodes/wavelength). The numerical methodology was then exercised on a generic combustor configuration using both collapsed and distributed combustion zone models with a short nozzle admittance approximation for the outflow boundary. In these cases, the response parameters were varied to determine stability limits defining resonant coupling onset...|$|R

Objective: To characterize acoustic immittance measures of infants from 0 to 3 {{months of age}} using multifrequency tympanometry in a prospective study. Method: 54 infants from 0 to 3 months of age were evaluated. The inclusion criteria included absence of respiratory infections during the evaluation, presence of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions, and absence of risk indicators for hearing loss. The subjects were evaluated by an audiologic interview, a visual inspection of the ear canal, and measures of acoustic immittance at the frequencies of 226 Hz, 678 Hz, and 1, 000 Hz.

Results: The results indicated {{the presence of an}} occlusion effect (2. 88 % at 226 Hz, 4. 81 % at 678 Hz and 3. 85 % at 1, 000 Hz), predominance of a tympanometric curve with a single peak (65. 35 % at 226 Hz, 81. 82 % at 678 Hz, and 77. 00 % at 1, 000 Hz), and tympanometric peak pressure ranging from - 155 to 180 daPa. Further, the equivalent ear canal volume increased with the frequency of the probe (0. 64 mL at 226 Hz, 1. 63 mho at 678 Hz, and 2. 59 mmho at 1, 000 Hz) and the peak compensated static <b>acoustic</b> <b>admittance</b> values increased with an increase in frequency (0. 51 mL at 226 Hz, 0. 55 mmho at 678 Hz and 1. 20 mmho at 1, 000 Hz). 93. 06 % of the tympanograms were classified as normal at 226 Hz, 81. 82 % at 678 Hz, and 77. 00 % at 1, 000 Hz, respectively.

No significant age or gender effects were found for tympanometric peak pressure. Peak Ytm measures, however, decreased with age in the left ear only across all age groups and were consistently higher for men than for women. After allowing for hearing loss, the effect of age on ASR thresholds was inconsistent. An increase in ASR thresholds with age was observed at selected frequencies but only when measured contralaterally, and these changes were not clinically significant. Overall, our findings suggest that current normative data for peak Ytm is too restricted for application in the older population, but there is insufficient evidence to warrant alternative normative data for the ASR threshold range in this same population. 13 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The Helmholtz {{equation}} is solved within a three-dimensional rectangular duct with a nonlocal radiation boundary condition at the duct exit plane. This condition accurately models the <b>acoustic</b> <b>admittance</b> at an arbitrarily-located computational boundary plane. A linear {{system of equations}} is constructed with second-order central differences for the Helmholtz operator and second-order backward differences for both local admittance conditions and the gradient term in the nonlocal radiation boundary condition. The resulting matrix {{equation is}} large, sparse, and non-Hermitian. The size {{and structure of the}} matrix makes direct solution techniques impractical; as a result, a nonstationary iterative technique is used for its solution. The theory behind the nonstationary technique is reviewed, and numerical results are presented for radiation from both a point source and a planar acoustic source. The solutions with the nonlocal boundary conditions are invariant to the location of the computational boundary, and the same nonlocal conditions are valid for all solutions. The nonlocal conditions thus provide a means of minimizing the size of three-dimensional computational domains...|$|E
40|$|To {{describe}} the acoustic instabilities in the combustion chambers of laterally burning solid propellant rockets {{the interaction of}} the mean flow with the acoustic waves is analysed, using multiple scale techniques, for realistic cases in which the combustion chamber is slender and the nozzle area is small compared with the cross-sectional area of the chamber. Associated with the longitudinal acoustic oscillations we find vorticity and entropy waves, with a wavelength typically small compared with the radius of the chamber, penetrating deeply into the chamber. We obtain a set of differential equations to calculate the radial and axial dependence of the amplitude of these waves. The boundary conditions are provided by the <b>acoustic</b> <b>admittance</b> of the propellant surface, given by an existing analysis of the thin gas-phase reaction layer adjacent to the solid-gas interface, and of the nozzle, accounting here for the possible effect of the vorticity and entropy waves. The equations are integrated in closed form and the results provide the growth rate of the disturbances, which we use to determine the conditions for instability of the longitudinal oscillations...|$|E
