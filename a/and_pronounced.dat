40|$|The tribal name Abenaki {{is adapted}} from the {{original}} Wôbanakiak, a noun that combines the morphemes for dawn or white light (wôban), and land (-aki) with an animate plural ending to indicate the people who dwell in that place (-ak).

5|$|The Tendaguru {{ecosystem}} primarily {{consisted of}} three types of environment: shallow, lagoon-like marine environments, tidal flats and low coastal environments; and vegetated inland environments. The marine environment existed above the fair weather wave base and behind siliciclastic and ooid barriers. It appeared to have had little change in salinity levels and experienced tides and storms. The coastal environments consisted of brackish coastal lakes, ponds and pools. These environments had little vegetation and were probably visited by herbivorous dinosaurs mostly during droughts. The well vegetated inlands were dominated by conifers. Overall, the Late Jurassic Tendaguru climate was subtropical to tropical with seasonal rains <b>and</b> <b>pronounced</b> dry periods. During the Early Cretaceous, the Tendaguru became more humid. The Tendaguru Beds {{are similar to the}} Morrison Formation of North America except in its marine interbeds.|$|E
