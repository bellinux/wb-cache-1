40|$|The {{specific}} {{interaction of}} blastocyst-derived {{human chorionic gonadotropin}} (hCG) and endometrial LH/hCG-R constitutes a fundamental component of the molecular dialogue at the materno-fetal interface. From our observations and studies from other groups, hCG was indeed shown to {{play a significant role}} in implantation and tolerance of the embryo, decidual differentiation and remodeling, as well as in placentation. The profile pattern of LH/hCG-R expression by endometrial epithelium correlates with the theoretical timing of the implantation window. Studies are currently being conducted in <b>assisted</b> <b>medical</b> <b>procreation</b> and in an animal model of implantation to establish the index of LH/hCG-R expression as a new biomarker of uterine receptivity for embryo implantation.

40|$|Abstract Background Externalization of {{phosphatidylserine}} (EPS) {{occurs in}} apoptotic-like spermatozoa {{and could be}} used to remove them from sperm preparations to enhance sperm quality for <b>assisted</b> <b>medical</b> <b>procreation.</b> We first characterized EPS in sperms from infertile patients in terms of frequency of EPS spermatozoa as well as localization of phosphatidylserine (PS) on spermatozoa. Subsequently, we determined the impact of depleting EPS spermatozoa on sperm quality. Methods EPS were visualized by fluorescently-labeled annexin V binding assay. Double staining with annexin V and Hoechst differentiates apoptotic from necrotic spermatozoa. We used magnetic-activated cell sorting using annexin V-conjugated microbeads (MACS-ANMB) technique to remove EPS spermatozoa from sperm prepared by density gradient centrifugation (DGC). The impact of this technique on sperm quality was evaluated by measuring progressive motility, viability, and the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by Rhodamine 123. Results Mean percentages of EPS spermatozoa were 14 % in DGC sperm. Four subpopulations of spermatozoa were identified: 70 % alive, 3 % early apoptotic, 16 % necrotic and 11 % late apoptotic or necrotic. PS were localized on head and/or midpiece or on the whole spermatozoa. MACS efficiently eliminates EPS spermatozoa. MACS combined with DGC allows a mean reduction of 70 % in EPS and of 60 % in MMP-disrupted spermatozoa with a mean increase of 50 % in sperm survival at 24 h. Conclusion Human ejaculates contain EPS spermatozoa which can mostly be eliminated by DGC plus MACS resulting in improved sperm long term viability, motility and MMP integrity. EPS may be used as an indicator of sperm quality and removal of EPS spermatozoa may enhance fertility potential in <b>assisted</b> <b>medical</b> <b>procreation.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|In several {{longitudinal}} studies, co-parental interactions {{have been}} formerly observed during the pregnancy, demonstrating how these interactive dynamics can predict {{the quality of}} family interactions {{with the presence of}} the baby. Cooperation between the parents during the first year after childbirth is the most predictive factor of the best future adjustment of the baby during the school age and social and affective development. In the last years, research focused on such interactive dynamics recognisable during the process of transition to parenthood; nevertheless, these studies pointed out features regarding a particular type of family defined as “traditional”, formed by a mother, a father and their biological children. Thanks {{to the development of the}} medicine concerning the <b>medical</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>procreation,</b> nowadays parenthood is accessible by gay and lesbian couples as well; gay and lesbian parenting is becoming a reality increasingly relevant also in Italy. Couple satisfaction, co-parental interactions and intuitive parental competences have been evaluated among a sample formed by 45 stable heterosexual, gay and lesbian couples without a child that want to become parents in the future. We used the systemic approach by the prenatal Lausanne Trilogue Play, a semi-naturalistic role-play: this tool involves in a cooperative task the two “parents” and a doll, which represents the child-to-be. Couple satisfaction has been evaluated with the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS Spanier, 1976). Preliminary data suggest that there are no differences between the three groups regarding co-parental intuitive competences and that a higher cohesion between the couple involves a better cooperation between the partners...|$|R
