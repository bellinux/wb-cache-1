5|$|In the 1960s, Noam Chomsky {{formulated}} the generative {{theory of}} language. According to this theory, {{the most basic}} form of language {{is a set of}} syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.|$|E

During {{the third}} meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke felt {{something}} like a spider's web on his face, and Shine told him she had a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world. Icke {{had been sent to}} heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> go wherever we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilized by having oil taken from the seabed.|$|E
25|$|As {{the range}} of {{permissible}} transformations becomes broader, {{the range of}} objects one is able to distinguish as preserved by {{the application of the}} transformations becomes narrower. Similarity transformations are fairly narrow (they preserve the relative distance between points) and thus <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> distinguish relatively many things (e.g., equilateral triangles from non-equilateral triangles). Continuous transformations (which can intuitively be thought of as transformations which allow non-uniform stretching, compression, bending, and twisting, but no ripping or glueing) <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> distinguish a polygon from an annulus (ring with a hole in the centre), but do not <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> distinguish two polygons from each other.|$|E

Long-term memory <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{store information}} over prolonged periods (days, weeks, years). We {{do not yet know}} the practical limit of long-term memory capacity. Short-term memory <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> store information over short time scales (seconds or minutes).|$|R

Lobate ejecta blankets (pictured left) and central pit craters are common on Mars but uncommon on the Moon, which may indicate the presence of near-surface volatiles (ice and water) on Mars.

Kurzweil further buttresses his argument by discussing current bio-engineering advances. Kurzweil suggests somatic gene therapy; after synthetic viruses with specific genetic information, the next step would be to apply this technology to gene therapy, replacing human DNA with synthesized genes.|$|E
