30|$|Offered {{by most of}} the <b>artists</b> <b>colour</b> makers {{since the}} early 1820 ’s, copper arsenic green pigments, more {{especially}} Emerald, were widely employed by many 19 th century painters, e.g. Manet, Van Gogh, Renoir, Monet and Cézanne. Progressively abandoned since {{the very beginning of the}} 20 th century because of their high toxicity, copper arsenic compounds are no longer available as artistic green pigments. In the light of this fact, overpaints containing Emerald had been most probably executed before the painting entry in the MRBAB collection in 1923.|$|R

50|$|The most {{important}} of these arguments was the sixth, that Jesus expanded the law but did not replace it. A number of others used analogy to explain this notion. Chrysostom used the analogy of a race saying that Jesus had added extra distance for the Christians to run, but the beginning remained the same. Theophylact of Bulgaria used the image of an <b>artist</b> <b>colouring</b> in an outline, and St. Thomas Aquinas saw it as how a tree still contains the seed. This view became the accepted Roman Catholic position, but was challenged in the Protestant reformation. Leading Protestants such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli rejected the idea Jesus had added to the Law. Rather they argued that Jesus only illustrated the true Law that had always existed, but had been badly understood by the Pharisees and other Jewish leaders. The Anabaptists took the opposite view and felt the Jesus had greatly reformed the Law and felt that Old Testament precepts could only be justified if they had been reaffirmed by Jesus.|$|R

30|$|The {{remarkable}} {{story of}} the Flora Graeca, {{one of the most}} magnificent printed books of the eighteenth century and the work of its artist, Ferdinand Bauer, has been well documented [1 – 4]. However, the methods and materials Bauer utilised in order to reproduce colour with astonishing accuracy in the 966 paintings of plants and 293 paintings of animals he produced for the endeavour during the period 1788 – 1794 has not been scrutinised. In particular, Bauer’s palette and his use of a complex numerical colour code system used for both the Flora Graeca and the lesser known and unpublished Fauna Graeca have not been extensively discussed. This study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of non-destructive, in situ methods to identify pigments used in Bauer’s watercolour paintings and gain insight into how the artist worked in the field. Part of a larger research project at the Bodleian Library, the study was instrumental in unravelling the <b>artist’s</b> <b>colour</b> code and understanding how his palette evolved over time by comparing pigments from 125 paintings from the Flora and Fauna Graeca with those identified in both an early painted colour chart [1, 2, 5] and in a number of later paintings [6].|$|R
