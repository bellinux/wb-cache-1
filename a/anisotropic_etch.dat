50|$|A {{combination}} of parallel plate and {{inductively coupled plasma}} RIE is possible. In this system, the ICP is employed as a high density source of ions which increases the etch rate, whereas a separate RF bias {{is applied to the}} substrate (silicon wafer) to create directional electric fields near the substrate to achieve more <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etch</b> profiles.|$|E
5000|$|Deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE) is {{a highly}} <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etch</b> process used to create deep penetration, steep-sided holes and {{trenches}} in wafers/substrates, typically with high aspect ratios [...] It was developed for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), which require these features, but {{is also used to}} excavate trenches for high-density capacitors for DRAM and more recently for creating through silicon vias (TSVs) in advanced 3D wafer level packaging technology [...]|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the large}} voltage difference, the {{positive}} ions tend to drift toward the wafer platter, where they collide with the samples to be etched. The ions react chemically with the materials {{on the surface of}} the samples, but can also knock off (sputter) some material by transferring some of their kinetic energy. Due to the mostly vertical delivery of reactive ions, reactive-ion etching can produce very <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etch</b> profiles, which contrast with the typically isotropic profiles of wet chemical etching.|$|E
50|$|Some etches {{undercut}} the masking layer and form cavities with sloping sidewalls. The distance of undercutting is called bias. Etchants with large bias are called isotropic, because they erode the substrate equally in all directions. Modern processes greatly prefer <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etches,</b> because they produce sharp, well-controlled features.|$|R
40|$|Simulations and {{experiments}} on {{three kinds of}} Si tip fabrication techniques had been done, which are <b>Anisotropic</b> Dry <b>Etching</b> (ADE), <b>Anisotropic</b> Wet <b>Etching</b> (AWE) and AWE combining with bonding. The simulation {{results showed that the}} parameters applied in the ADE and AWE should be controlled much more precisely than AWE combining with bonding to get expected tips. The experiments prove that the parameters of fabricating silicon tip by ADE and AWE have little tolerance. The conclusions on AWE combining with bonding drew from simulations are verified in the detail experiments. From the simulations and experiments, excellent reliability and controllability are witnessed in AWE combining with bonding and a tip with top diameter within 23. 44 nm had been achieved...|$|R

50|$|In {{industrial}} processes, such as etching steps, isotropic {{means that}} the process proceeds at the same rate, regardless of direction. Simple chemical reaction and removal of a substrate by an acid, a solvent or a reactive gas is often very close to isotropic. Conversely, anisotropic {{means that the}} attack rate of the substrate is higher in a certain direction. <b>Anisotropic</b> <b>etch</b> processes, where vertical etch-rate is high, but lateral etch-rate is very small are essential processes in microfabrication of integrated circuits and MEMS devices.|$|E
50|$|Once the ink {{has been}} applied to the {{substrate}} the SAM layer acts as a resist to common wet etching techniques allowing for the creation of high resolution patterning. The patterned SAMs layer is a step in a series of steps to create complex microstructures. For example, applying the SAM layer on top of gold and etching creates microstructures of gold. After this step etched areas of gold exposes the substrate which can further be etched using traditional <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etch</b> techniques. Because of the microcontact printing technique no traditional photolithography is needed to accomplish these steps.|$|E

Using this procedure the influence of an applied potential has been investigated in terms of microscopic properties. Model parameter trends show a good correlation with chemical/electrochemical reaction mechanism and mono- and dihydride terminated steps reactivity difference. Results also indicate a minimum in (111) terrace roughening which results in a peak in anisotropic ratio at the non-OCP applied potential of - 1250 mV vs OCP...|$|E
40|$|The {{strength}} properties of a micromechanical acceleration sensor for airbag application fabricated from single crystalline silicon {{were analyzed using}} fracture mechanical concepts. The investigations revealed that {{the strength of the}} suspended seismic mass depends on local stress concentrations, either on the <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etched</b> notch or on the passivation pattern {{on the surface of the}} suspension. Different fracture concepts had to be applied for the strength analysis of both cases. The experimental results were found to agree very well with the theoretical prediction. It can be concluded that the strength of the sensor is high enough to ensure its reliability during application. In general, appropriate fracture mechanical concepts have a great potential to consider the strength and reliability properties of micromechanical components during the layout and design stage which contributes to reducing the development efforts...|$|R

Here we demonstrate the production of near-atomically perfect Si blazed substrates with an ultra-high groove density (10, 000 l/mm) together with the measured and theoretical performance of an Al/Zr multilayer coating on the grating. A 1 st order absolute efficiency of 13 percent and 24. 6 percent was achieved at incidence angles of 11 o and 36 o respectively. Cross-sectional TEM shows the effect of smoothing caused by the surface mobility of deposited atoms and we correlate this effect with a reduction in peak diffraction efficiency.

50|$|Bulk {{micromachining}} {{starts with}} a silicon wafer or other substrates which is selectively etched, using photolithography to transfer a pattern from a mask to the surface. Like surface micromachining, bulk micromachining can be performed with wet or dry etches, although the most common etch in silicon is the <b>anisotropic</b> wet <b>etch.</b> This etch {{takes advantage of the}} fact that silicon has a crystal structure, which means its atoms are all arranged periodically in lines and planes.
