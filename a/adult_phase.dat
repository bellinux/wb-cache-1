5|$|Spotted hyenas may {{contract}} brucellosis, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. They {{are vulnerable}} to Trypanosoma congolense, which is contracted by consuming already infected herbivores, rather than through direct infection from tsetse flies. It is known that adult spotted hyenas in the Serengeti have antibodies against rabies, canine herpes, canine brucella, canine parvovirus, feline calici, leptospirosis, bovine brucella, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. During the canine distemper outbreak of 1993–94, molecular studies indicated that the viruses isolated from hyenas and lions were {{more closely related to}} each other than to the closest canine distemper virus in dogs. Evidence of canine distemper in spotted hyenas has also been recorded in the Masai Mara. Exposure to rabies does not cause clinical symptoms or affect individual survival or longevity. Analyses of several hyena saliva samples showed that the species is unlikely to be a rabies vector, thus indicating that the species catches the disease from other animals rather than from intraspecifics. The microfilaria of Dipetalonema dracuneuloides have been recorded in spotted hyenas in northern Kenya. The species is known to carry at least three cestode species of the genus Taenia, none of which are harmful to humans. It also carries protozoan parasites of the genus Hepatozoon in the Serengeti, Kenya and South Africa. Spotted hyenas may act as hosts in the life-cycles of various parasites which start life in herbivores; Taenia hyaenae and T. olnogojinae occur in hyenas in their <b>adult</b> <b>phase.</b> Trichinella spiralis are found as cysts in hyena muscles.|$|E

25|$|Infected {{individuals}} release Schistosoma {{eggs into}} water via their fecal material or urine. After larvae hatch from these eggs, the larvae infect {{a very specific}} type of freshwater snail. These larvae undergo {{the next phase of}} their lifecycle in these snails, spending their time reproducing and developing. Once this step has been completed, the parasite leaves the snail and enters the water column. The parasite can live in the water for only 48 hours without a human host. Once a host has been found, the worm enters its blood vessels. For several weeks, the worm will remain in the vessels, continuing its development into its <b>adult</b> <b>phase.</b> When maturity is reached, mating occurs and eggs are produced. Eggs enter the bladder/intestine and are excreted through urine and feces and the process repeats. If the eggs do not get excreted, they can become engrained in the body tissues and cause a variety of problems such as immune reactions and organ damage.|$|E

25|$|The lovebug {{has been}} {{recorded}} to have two flights that occur each {{year in which the}} lovebug will have a total lifespan of about 4–9 months depending on flight season. The first flight occurs during the months of April and May and the second flight occurs in August and September. The flights generally last about 4–5 weeks each time. Female lovebugs can lay as many as 100-350 eggs and will regularly lay these eggs around decaying material on the top layer of ground soil. Lovebug eggs generally hatch after 2–4 days depending flight season. Once the eggs have hatched, the larvae will start feeding on the decaying material around them such as decaying plants on the soil and other decaying organic material and will live and remain in the soil until they develop to the pupa stage. During the warmer months the lovebug larva will remain in the larvae phase for approximately 120 days and approximately 240 days during the cooler months. Lovebugs typically stay in the pupa stage about 7–9 days before reaching the <b>adult</b> <b>phase</b> in which they can start reproducing. Once adults, lovebugs are ready to mate and will start copulating to begin reproducing. Adult male love bugs will emerge first from the pupal stage and will hover around until female lovebugs emerge. Mating between love bugs takes place immediately after emergence of the adult females. Male lovebugs will copulate with a female and will remain paired up until the female has been fully fertilized. Copulation takes place for 2–3 days before the female detaches and lays her eggs and dies. Adult females have been recorded to live up to seven days while adult males may live up to two to five days but on average lovebugs will live three to four days. However, Thornhill (1976c) recorded recapture data that showed males lived longer in the field than females.|$|E
500|$|Horner {{thought he}} had found the {{mechanism}} driving this evolution, elaborating on ideas he had developed even before he had investigated Landslide Butte. The animals were living on a narrow strip on the east-coast of Laramidia, bordering the Western Interior Seaway and constrained in the west by the [...] high proto-Rocky Mountains. During the Bearpaw Transgression sea levels were rising, steadily reducing the width of their coastal habitat from about [...] This led to stronger selection pressures, the severest for Achelousaurus that lived during the phase that the coastal strip was at its narrowest. The lower number of individuals that the smaller habitat could have sustained constituted a population bottleneck, making rapid evolution possible. Increased sexual selection would have induced changes in the sexual ornamentation such as spikes, horns and bosses. A reduced environmental stress by lower sea levels on the other hand, would be typified by adaptive radiation. That sexual selection had indeed been the main mechanism would be proven by the fact that young individuals of all three populations were very similar: they all had two frill spikes, a small nasal horn pointing to the front, and orbital horns in the form of slightly elevated knobs. Only in the <b>adult</b> <b>phase</b> did they begin to differ. According to Horner, this also showed that the populations were very closely related.|$|E

2500|$|The moth – the <b>adult</b> <b>phase</b> of the {{lifecycle}} – is {{not capable}} of functional flight, {{in contrast to the}} wild B. mandarina and other Bombyx species, whose males fly to meet females and for evasion from predators. Some may emerge with the ability to lift off and stay airborne, but sustained flight cannot be achieved. This is because their bodies are too big and heavy for their small wings. However, some silkmoths can still fly. Silkmoths have a wingspan of [...] and a white, hairy body. Females are about two to three times bulkier than males (for they are carrying many eggs), but are similarly colored. Adult Bombycidae have reduced mouth parts and do not feed, though a human caretaker can feed them.|$|E
2500|$|Mosquito {{habits of}} oviposition, {{the ways in}} which they lay their eggs, vary {{considerably}} between species, and the morphologies of the eggs vary accordingly. The simplest procedure is that followed by many species of Anopheles; like many other gracile species of aquatic insects, females just fly over the water, bobbing up and down to the water surface and dropping eggs more or less singly. The bobbing behavior occurs among some other aquatic insects as well, for example mayflies and dragonflies; it is sometimes called [...] "dapping". The eggs of Anopheles species are roughly cigar-shaped and have floats down their sides. Females of many common species can lay 100–200 eggs during the course of the <b>adult</b> <b>phase</b> of their lifecycles. Even with high egg and intergenerational mortality, over a period of several weeks, a single successful breeding pair can create a population of thousands.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Acetabularia {{acetabulum}} {{is a giant}} unicellular green alga whose {{size and}} complex life cycle make it an attractive model for understanding morphogenesis and subcellular compartmentalization. The life cycle of this marine unicell is composed of several developmental <b>phases.</b> Juvenile and <b>adult</b> <b>phases</b> are temporally sequential but physiologically and morphologically distinct. To identify genes specific to juvenile and <b>adult</b> <b>phases,</b> we created two subtracted cDNA libraries, one adult-specific and one juvenile-specific, and analyzed 941 randomly chosen ESTs from them. Results Clustering analysis suggests virtually no overlap between the two libraries. Preliminary expression data also suggests that we were successful at isolating transcripts differentially expressed between the two developmental phases and that many transcripts are specific to one phase or the other. Comparison of our EST sequences against publicly available sequence databases indicates that ESTs from the adult and the juvenile libraries partition into different functional classes. Three conserved sequence elements were common to several of the ESTs and were also found within the genomic sequence of the carbonic anhydrase 1 gene from A. acetabulum. To date, these conserved elements are specific to A. acetabulum. Conclusions Our data provide strong evidence that <b>adult</b> and juvenile <b>phases</b> in A. acetabulum vary significantly in gene expression. We discuss their possible roles in cell growth and morphogenesis {{as well as in}} phase change. We also discuss the potential role of the conserved elements found within the EST sequences in post-transcriptional regulation, particularly mRNA localization and/or stability. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{well-established}} {{association between}} stress and depression is explored in a lifespan context {{in relation to}} adverse childhood experience. A new retrospective interview instrument, the <b>Adult</b> Life <b>Phase</b> Interview (ALPHI) examined the number of chronic stressors (or `adversities') experienced over the adult life course in relation to chronic or recurrent clinical depression. The role of such lifetime adversity in mediating the relationship between childhood neglect/abuse and adult disorder was examined. Method: The ALPHI uses an investigator-based, contextual approach suited to retrospective and time-linked enquiries. Reliability of the instrument {{was found to be}} satisfactory. Its association with both lifetime clinical depression and childhood neglect or abuse was examined in a community series of 198 women, consisting of 99 sister pairs, where one-half of the series was selected for having had adverse childhood experience and the other for comparison. Results: Adult adversity, both at settled/fixed times and at times of major life change, was significantly higher among those with prior childhood neglect or abuse. Both a high adult adversity score and childhood neglect or abuse were related to chronic or recurrent episodes of clinical depression, with logistic regression indicating both indices contributed independently to disorder. The same results held when controls were made for sister status, given possible familial bias in experience, and for age, since women under age 25 had fewer <b>adult</b> <b>phases</b> and less adversity. Conclusions: Characteristics of <b>adult</b> life <b>phases</b> and change-points are described and the relevance of the measure for intensive survey work seeking to investigate relationships between lifespan experience and depression is discussed...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the safety, tolerability, and effects of AMG 145 on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in healthy and hypercholesterolemic subjects on statin therapy. BackgroundProprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK 9) down-regulates surface expression of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R), increasing serum LDL-C. AMG 145, a fully human monoclonal antibody to PCSK 9, prevents PCSK 9 /LDL-R interaction, restoring LDL-R recycling. MethodsHealthy <b>adults</b> (<b>phase</b> 1 a) were randomized to 1 dose of AMG 145 : 7, 21, 70, 210, or 420 mg SC; 21 or 420 mg IV; or matching placebo. Hypercholesterolemic <b>adults</b> (<b>phase</b> 1 b) receiving low- to moderate-dose statins were randomized to multiple SC doses of AMG 145 : 14 or 35 mg once weekly (QW) × 6, 140 or 280 mg every 2 weeks (Q 2 W) × 3, 420 mg every 4 weeks × 2, or matching placebo. Eleven subjects receiving high-dose statins and 6 subjects with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia were randomized to SC AMG 145 140 mg or placebo Q 2 W × 3. ResultsIn the trials (AMG 145 n = 85, placebo n = 28), AMG 145 reduced LDL-C up to 64 % (p < 0. 0001) versus placebo after 1 dose ≥ 21 mg and up to 81 % (p < 0. 001) with repeated doses ≥ 35 mg QW. No serious adverse events (AEs) occurred. Overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs was similar in AMG 145 versus placebo groups: 69 % versus 71 % (phase 1 a); 65 % versus 64 % (phase 1 b). ConclusionsIn phase 1 studies, AMG 145 significantly reduced serum LDL-C in healthy and hypercholesterolemic statin-treated subjects, including those with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or taking the highest doses of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, with an overall AE profile similar to placebo...|$|R
