Meissner won the bronze medal.|$|E
25|$|Some time later, Japp phones Poirot {{and tells}} him Winnie has been found about fifteen miles from Amiens. She is in a daze, has been doped {{according}} to the doctor who examined her, and is unable to remember much after setting off from her home town of Cranchester. She remembers nothing of meeting one of Miss Pope's staff, Miss Burshaw, in London before the trip to France. Despite the girl being found, Poirot speaks with Detective Inspector Hearn, who has been dealing with the case and is no nearer to solving the mystery of how the girl disappeared. The only {{other people in the}} carriage seemed clear of suspicion – two middle-aged spinsters, two French commercial travellers from Lyon, a young man called James Elliot and his flashy wife, and an <b>American</b> <b>lady</b> about whom very little is known. He is able to confirm that Winnie's shoes were found by the rail line which confirms Poirot's theory.|$|E
2500|$|Filipino women {{joined the}} rows and ranks of Filipino men golf-gamers in 1938. The first Filipino woman {{to compete in}} the field of golf {{dominated}} by European and <b>American</b> <b>lady</b> golfers was Dominga Capati during the 1938 Philippine Women's Open Golf Championship. Capati took some time-off as a laundrywoman to excel in golf. It was in Capati's honor that the Dominga Capati Memorial Tournament was held at the Wack Wack Golf and Country Club on March 19, 1968.|$|E

2500|$|Topsyturveydom (sometimes spelled Topsyturvydom or Topseyturveydom) is a one-act {{operetta}} by W. S. Gilbert {{with music}} by Alfred Cellier. Styled [...] "an entirely original musical extravaganza", {{it is based}} on one of Gilbert's Bab Ballads, [...] "My Dream". It opened on 21 March 1874 at the Criterion Theatre in London and ran until 17 April, for about 25 performances. This was the first work shown at the newly built Criterion, and it was played together with An <b>American</b> <b>Lady,</b> written and performed by Gilbert's friend, the dramatist and Fun magazine founder, Henry J. Byron. The musical score to Topsyturveydom does not survive, but amateur productions in recent decades have used newly composed scores or performed the work as a non-musical play.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, I dare say," [...] {{returned}} her uncle. [...] "You <b>American</b> <b>ladies</b> are so--up to snuff, as you say. But your aunt thought we'd better have her with us, in any case." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Your ivy is {{so beautifully}} soft and thick," [...] said the <b>American</b> <b>lady,</b> [...] "it seems to cover almost everything. It {{must be the}} most poetical thing in England." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But not,' said Merton, 'in the Scotch, {{which is}} yours; oh distant cousin of a marquis! Consequently by rich <b>American</b> <b>lady</b> pupils [...] "you are {{not one to}} be desired."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But your father? I {{have heard}} you speak with bitter regret of this affair of Lady Mary's, because it vexes him. Would your {{marriage}} with an <b>American</b> <b>lady</b> vex him less?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I confess," [...] said Professor Tallboys, [...] "that I am {{not sorry}} {{that such an}} {{occasion}} should occur of showing an <b>American</b> <b>lady's</b> domestic powers. I flatter myself they do not discredit her cause." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No?" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I {{thought all}} <b>American</b> <b>ladies</b> had been abroad"; {{and now he}} said, with easy {{recognition}} of her resolution not to help him out, [...] "I suppose you have your diploma from the Philadelphia school." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>American</b> <b>ladies</b> {{and gentlemen}} {{travelling}} in England, are amazed and delighted to find [...] "an American Novel" [...] welcomed with such warmth and enthusiasm, by the [...] "cultivated" [...] and [...] "influential," [...] {{in all parts}} of the Kingdom.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} been in England before," [...] said the <b>American</b> <b>lady,</b> [...] "yet it is so pretty that I feel as if I have been away from it for a long time." ...|$|E
60|$|On one {{occasion}} I accompanied an <b>American</b> <b>lady</b> to a German Opera House. The taking-off of hats in the German Schausspielhaus is obligatory, and again I would it were so in England. But the <b>American</b> <b>lady</b> {{is accustomed to}} disregard rules made by mere man. She explained to the doorkeeper {{that she was going}} to wear her hat. He, on his side, explained to her that she was not: they were both a bit short with one another. I took the opportunity to turn aside and buy a programme: the fewer people there are mixed up in an argument, I always think, the better.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Penelope Morse," [...] the Inspector continued. [...] "She {{is a young}} <b>American</b> <b>lady,</b> {{who lives}} with an invalid aunt in Park Lane, and who is taken {{everywhere}} by the Duchess of Devenham, another aunt, I believe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{assure you}} {{we are always}} {{discussing}} and differing," [...] said Percy Beaumont. [...] "She is awfully argumentative. <b>American</b> <b>ladies</b> certainly don't mind contradicting you. Upon my word I don't think I was ever treated so by a woman before. She's so devilish positive." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{confess that}} I {{did not see}} what the bother was, but I had not the courage to ask, for I had already {{conceived}} a wholesome dread {{of the mystery of}} an <b>American</b> <b>lady's</b> nerves. So I merely suggested, [...] "And that is the way that people usually manage?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{met them}} at Muriel Towers," [...] said Lady Clanmorne. [...] "I heard of you there: a most {{distinguished}} party. There was an <b>American</b> <b>lady</b> there, was there not? a charming person, who sang, and acted, and did {{all sorts of}} things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{may well}} say it, sir. Yet it is but the truth.

6000|$|... “I {{assure you}} we’re always {{discussing}} and differing,” Mr. Beaumont however asseverated. “She’s awfully argumentative. <b>American</b> <b>ladies</b> certainly don’t mind contradicting you flat. Upon my word I don’t think I was ever treated so {{by a woman}} before. We have ours ever so much more in hand. She’s so devilish positive.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am not so}} {{sure about}} it," [...] she said; [...] "the Almighty don't seem to 'ave made too many of that sort. Unless these <b>American</b> <b>ladies</b> that you speak of are going to start a factory of their own. I am afraid there is {{disappointment}} in store for them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I never know," [...] {{said the}} bishop, [...] "how {{to deal with}} these <b>American</b> <b>ladies.</b> I never can make out what they believe, or what they disbelieve. It is a sort of {{confusion}} between Mrs. Beecher Stowe and the Fifth Avenue congregation and--Barnum," [...] he added with a twinkling eye.|$|R
60|$|Lunch-time {{found the}} young couple attacking a steak and chips in an obscure hostelry with avidity.

6000|$|... "That {{could never}} be," [...] said Lady St. Jerome; [...] "though, {{if it could}} have been, a source of {{happiness}} to Lord St. Jerome and myself {{would not have been}} wanting. We greatly regard our kinsman, but, between ourselves," [...] added Lady St. Jerome in a low voice, [...] "it was supposed that he was attached to the <b>American</b> <b>lady</b> of whom you were speaking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I quite {{agree with}} a very clever countrywoman of mine,” the elder lady {{continued}} with charming ardour even if with imperfect relevancy. She smiled at the two gentlemen for a moment with terrible brightness, as if to toss at their feet—upon their native heath—the gauntlet of defiance. “For me {{there are only two}} social positions worth speaking of—that of an <b>American</b> <b>lady</b> and that of the Emperor of Russia.” ...|$|E
