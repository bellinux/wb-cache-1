The core play mechanics and story for all games remained mostly the same with some artistic changes in the remastered versions. For the remastering, both games have had a graphics overhaul to allow them to support modern 720p resolution on consoles, as well as run at locked 30 frames per second. Both games also feature an <b>alternate</b> <b>voice</b> dub, as well as PlayStation Network Trophies and Xbox 360 Achievements. Players have the option to switch between the original voice acting and the <b>alternate</b> <b>voice</b> acting for Silent Hill 2, while the re-dub is mandatory for Silent Hill 3 because it lacks the original voice acting.|$|E

50|$|Using {{these two}} {{gameplay}} styles, Puyo Puyo Tetris features five main game modes, {{each of which}} can be played with up to four players, both locally or online, or against computer opponents. With the exception of Swap and Fusion modes, each player can independently choose between Puyo and Tetris styles. Versus mode is a standard match in which players face off against each other with their chosen style. By performing chain combos in Puyo style or clearing lines in Tetris style, garbage is sent over to the player's opponents, which appears as Garbage Puyos in Puyo style and added lines in Tetris style. Players lose once their playing field is filled over the top. Party mode throws in power-ups that can give the player benefits or hinder opponents. The player who has the highest score {{at the end of a}} time limit wins, and players won't be eliminated from filling up the board in this mode. Swap mode has the players periodically alternate between Puyo and Tetris styles, each on its own board. Players lose when one of their board becomes completely filled. Fusion mode combines both Puyo and Tetris styles onto one board, with Tetrinimoes sinking below any Puyos when placed. Finally, Big Bang mode combines Fever mode from Puyo Puyo with Lucky Attack from Tetris. Depending on the style, players must quickly clear waves of pre-arranged Puyos or Tetris blocks, aiming to clear as many waves as possible within a time limit. After each time limit, players are dealt damage depending on how much slower they were against the leading player, with players eliminated if they run out of health. There is also an Adventure story campaign consisting of various battles against computer opponents, and six single-player Challenge modes; Endless Fever, Endless Puyo, Tiny Puyo, Sprint, Marathon, and Ultra. Playing through each mode earns credits that can be spent in an in-game shop to unlock different art styles for Puyos and Tetriminoes and <b>alternate</b> <b>voice</b> packs.|$|E

40|$|About the book: Ghosts in the Machine {{examines}} the complex relationships {{between gender and}} {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT). Written by women in four countries on three continents, it discusses the educational, social, artistic, and political implications of a feminine voice in the design of technology. The research presented here explores the «gendering of technology» and, in doing so, describes the Internet, computer games, computer-based design and construction environments, and digital art from a perspective that puts the social context in a key role. As the rate of technology design continues to grow, it is imperative that books such as this provide an <b>alternate</b> <b>voice</b> to the prevailing descriptions of technology use.

40|$|In many earlier {{investigations}} a recall advantage of auditory lists spoken {{in a single}} voice has been found over recall of lists spoken in two <b>alternating</b> <b>voices.</b> One explanation proposed is an organization strategy which makes recall of alternating-voice lists so difficult. The strategy implies sorting same-voice words into same-voice groups at encoding. Based on this proposition, {{it was assumed that}} voice-by-voice recall would be better than recall in order of presentation, as then the recall instruction and the organization of items in memory would be in concordance. The present experiment tested and was unable to support this hypothesis. However, an intriguing interaction between recall instruction and the sex of the participants was found, indicating that males perform worse in the voice-by-voice recall instruction than in serial recall while females’ performance did not differ between the two recall instructions. Implications of these results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Speech {{consists}} of <b>alternating</b> <b>voiced</b> and unvoiced sections. Voiced speech {{consists of}} multiple harmonics of some fundamental (F 0); unvoiced speech consists of silence, or filtered noise. Here, speech is wideband bandpass filtered into many bands (modelling the cochlea). Each filter output is rectified (modelling the organ of Corti hair cell action), and bandpass filtered by convolution with {{the difference between}} two causal Gaussian averaging functions. This detects and emphasises the amplitude modulation resulting from unresolved harmonics (and models the combined effect of the auditory nerve and certain cochlear nucleus cell types). This output is compressed, summed across the bands, then used to discover glottal pulses. The presence of glottal pulses signals voicing, and the time between glottal pulses is used to find F 0. Results show good performance, particularly on male speakers. The system is reasonably resistant to background noise. 1 Background ISSN 0968 - 0640 Speech sound [...] ...|$|R
