Unless the Chamber decides {{at the outset that}} an application is inadmissible or should be struck out, written observations are requested from the applicant and respondent Party, after which the Chamber deliberates and decides on a case. In addition to the written procedure, the Chamber may decide to schedule a public hearing for oral argument by the parties and submission of evidence by witnesses and experts. The Chamber may also invite written or oral <b>amicus</b> <b>curiae</b> <b>submissions.</b> If the Chamber finds a violation, it may, in its written decision on the merits, issue an order indicating the steps that the respondent Party must take to remedy the breach, including orders to cease and desist or grant monetary relief. At any stage of the proceedings, it may also order provisional measures or attempt to facilitate an amicable resolution based on respect for human rights.|$|E
50|$|In the movement's sole major case, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, it was {{represented}} by the Thomas More Law Center, which had been seeking a test-case on the issue {{for at least five}} years. However conflicting agendas resulted in the withdrawal of a number of Discovery Institute Fellows as expert witnesses, at the request of DI director Bruce Chapman, and mutual recriminations with the DI after the case was lost. The Alliance Defense Fund briefly represented the Foundation for Thought and Ethics in its unsuccessful motion to intervene in this case, and prepared amicus curiae briefs on behalf of the DI and FTE in it. It has also made <b>amicus</b> <b>curiae</b> <b>submissions</b> and offered to pay for litigation, in other (actual and potential) creationism-related cases. On a far smaller scale, Larry Caldwell and his wife operate under the name Quality Science Education for All, and have made a number of lawsuits in furtherance of the movement's anti-evolution agenda. In 2005 they brought at least three separate lawsuits to further the intelligent design movement's agenda. One was later abandoned, two were dismissed.|$|E

40|$|Today, {{more than}} ever, {{the role of}} investor-state {{mediation}} cannot be appraised without regard to mounting concerns raised against investor-state arbitration. Over the past three decades, investor-state arbitration has proliferated, only to face strong and escalating opposition stemming from characteristics inherent to investor-state arbitration involving investments in public service sectors, issues of public health, environmental regulation, and human rights. Moreover, investor-state cases often involve allegations of state misconduct, are costly, and taxpayers ultimately {{bear the burden of}} compensation payments. Investor-state arbitration has also been criticized for its lack of transparency. This final concern has given rise to a surge of transparency initiatives that have resulted in the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules and the Mauritius Convention that seek to guarantee the ‘transaprencization’ of investor-state arbitration by requiring document disclosure, open hearings and <b>amici</b> <b>curiae</b> <b>submissions.</b> Arguably, this wave of transparency may help alleviate some of the concerns against investor-state arbitration. At their inception both investor-state arbitration and investor-state mediation were confidential procedures. However, given recent developments, it is timely to examine whether investor-state mediation will be used not merely as a faster and cost-efficient pre-arbitration dispute resolution method, but also as a means of avoiding the transparency obligations associated with investor-state arbitration. This is particularly relevant in light of recent developments by UNCITRAL in drafting a multilateral convention on the enforcement of mediated settlements. This article addresses the prospects for transparency in investor-state mediation given the recent wave of transparency in investor-state arbitration...|$|R

40|$|Law plays a {{significant}} role in contemporary transatlantic relations outside of the bilateral context which, from the perspective of EU external relations law, might seem neither conventional nor apparent. Non-bilateral transatlantic relations increasingly deploy law as a communication tool between the two legal orders. For example, in 2011, the US intervened informally and anonymously in the formulation of EU legislation, while the US House of Representatives passed legislation to prohibit the impact of EU law upon the US legal order. Another example is constituted by EU <b>amicus</b> <b>curiae</b> <b>submissions</b> before the US Supreme Court in death penalty cases. The so-called Brussels effect is also the subject of recent scholarship, assessing the perceived spillover effect of EU regulatory standards onto US rules.

40|$|The Holy Grail of ICSID Arbitration {{is social}} justice. Amicus Curiae is the Grail Castle {{that holds the}} sacred chalice of ICSID’s salvation. This paper {{comments}} on both the procedural and substantive law of <b>amicus</b> <b>curiae</b> <b>submissions</b> in Investor-State arbitrations. Issues {{of human rights and}} public interest that arise in these disputes must be addressed through an increase of amicus submissions whilst still protecting provisions for confidentiality. Only by identifying matters that are highly relevant to the public interest that normally would not be addressed (either in the dispute or elsewhere) can amicus curiae be used. It is incumbent upon arbitration tribunals to allow these issues to be raised in connection to the dispute so that the procedural and substantive requirements to file leave for amicus curiae can be undertaken. The principle of amicus curiae serves as the foundation for social justice in ICSID arbitrations. 13 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{past several}} decades have {{witnessed}} a remarkable {{increase in the number}} of <b>amicus</b> <b>curiae</b> briefs filed at the U. S. Supreme Court. While scholars debate the effectiveness of <b>amicus</b> <b>curiae</b> briefs, they generally agree on the effectiveness of briefs filed by executive attorneys. A plethora of studies address the <b>amicus</b> <b>curiae</b> brief activity of the solicitor general, but relatively few examine state attorneys general. State attorneys general are the legal representatives of the states and have become increasingly successful as amici since the early 1980 s. I explore state attorney general <b>amicus</b> <b>curiae</b> brief activity and argue that existing theories of <b>amicus</b> <b>curiae</b> participation by the solicitor general and interest groups, are inadequate for state attorneys general because of the unique institutional context in which state attorneys general operate. State attorneys general, I argue, must balance political, legal, and administrative factors when filing <b>amicus</b> <b>curiae</b> briefs. I also recognizes that <b>amicus</b> <b>curiae</b> briefs are not a singular event and are instead a process in which actors make several decisions across a variety of contexts.

40|$|This book {{offers a}} {{systematic}} analysis {{of the interaction between}} international investment law, investment arbitration and human rights, including the role of national and international courts, investor-state arbitral tribunals and alternative jurisdictions, the risks of legal and jurisdictional fragmentation, the human rights dimensions of investment law and arbitration, and the relationships of substantive and procedural principles of justice to international investment law. Part I summarizes the main conclusions of the 24 book chapters and places them into the broader context of the principles of justice, global administrative law and multilevel constitutionalism that may be relevant for the administration of justice in international economic law and investor-state arbitration. Part II includes contributions clarifying the constitutional dimensions of transnational investment disputes and investor-state arbitration, as reflected in the increasing number of arbitral awards and <b>amicus</b> <b>curiae</b> <b>submissions</b> addressing human rights concerns. Part III addresses the need for principle-oriented ordering and the normative congruence of diverse national, regional and worldwide legal regimes, focusing on the pertinent dispute settlement practices and legal interpretation methods of regional economic courts and human rights courts, which increasingly interpret international economic law with due regard to human rights obligations of the governments concerned. Part IV includes twelve case studies on the potential human rights dimensions of specific protection standards (e. g. fair and equitable treatment, non-discrimination), applicable law (e. g. national and international human rights law, rules on corporate social accountability), procedural law issues (e. g. <b>amicus</b> <b>curiae</b> <b>submissions)</b> and specific fundamental rights (e. g. the protection of human health, access to water, and protection of the environment). These case studies discuss not only the still limited examples of human rights discourse in investor-state arbitral awards; they also probe the potential legal relevance of investor-state arbitration for the judicial recognition, interpretation and balancing of primary rules, such as of investment law and human rights law, {{in the light of the}} principles of justice as defined by national and international law.

40|$|The {{continuing}} {{debate over}} the use of amicus curiae briefs at the World Trade Organization (“WTO”) raises interesting questions about the influence of the U.

40|$|Submitting <b>amicus</b> <b>curiae</b> briefs is a mean {{by which}} {{non-governmental}} organisations (NGOs) can influence {{procedures in the}} WTO.

Non-State actors focused upon in this paper include non-Governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations and individual academics. An effective ICC is one that is able to undertake its work in an environment as immune as possible from politics and one in which the judiciary are exposed to a diversity of ideas and legal interpretation. The paper argues that non-State actors can {{play a significant role in}} international criminal prosecutions, in particular by gathering evidence and submitting amicus curiae briefs. The paper is divided into 4 sections. Section one sets the scene by undertaking a critique of NGOs within international law and the United Nations system. This section also describes, in Chapter 2, the process leading to the creation of a Statute for an International Criminal Court and then briefly inspects the Statute. Section 2 reviews the role non-State actors played in the creation of the Statute. Within this section Chapter 3 deals with the NGO Coalition for and ICC and Chapter 4 the contribution of the ICRC, an international organization. Section 3, consisting of Chapter 5, investigates the activities of non-State actors, in particular NGOs, at the ad hoc Tribunals in particular the gathering of evidence. Section 4 focuses upon the submission of amicus curiae briefs with Chapter 6 exploring this mechanism in domestic courts and at the International Court of Justice. Chapter 7 examines non-State actors' <b>amicus</b> <b>curiae</b> <b>submissions</b> at the ad hoc Tribunals.

40|$|In {{order to}} offer a {{comprehensive}} analysis of transparency and public participation in the WTO dispute settlement system, this memorandum first considers the current participatory practice throughout the various steps of the dispute settlement process. Secondly, {{the current state of}} the DSU negotiations is analyzed along with positions and arguments of relevant WTO Members. Finally, several recommendations for the next steps in the negotiations are presented, including suggested language for possible amendments to the current text of the DSU. The analysis of current practice reveals that the WTO dispute settlement system already allows for an important measure of transparency and public participation. Requests for consultations, panel establishment or appeal and final reports are published promptly on the WTO website. A number of hearings of panels and the Appellate Body are open to the public and NGOs have the possibility to submit amicus curiae briefs. The mostly informal efforts of the adjudicating bodies and WTO Secretariat through extensive DSU interpretation and transparency measures, respectively, thus have already led to some DSU review in practice. More formal changes of the DSU towards transparency and participation would require the political will of WTO Members to reach consensus on an amendment of the DSU in the ongoing review under the Doha mandate. The current state of the negotiations indicates that WTO Members are generally in favor of open hearings and public submissions but also try to include a prohibition of <b>amicus</b> <b>curiae</b> <b>submissions</b> into the DSU. Any recommendation for DSU review therefore has to consider whether it is necessary to amend the DSU or whether the current practice of WTO bodies is sufficient to create avenues for transparency and participation. While an amendment of the DSU has certainly more legitimacy as it includes all WTO Members and not only those that frequently use the dispute settlement system, a continuing DSU review in practice might be more realistic in light of the lengthy and difficult negotiation process...|$|E
