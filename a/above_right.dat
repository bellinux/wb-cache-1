5|$|Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) {{is shown}} {{as an example}} of an {{irreversible}} protease inhibitor in the figure <b>above</b> <b>right.</b> The enzyme hydrolyses the phosphorus–fluorine bond, but the phosphate residue remains bound to the serine in the active site, deactivating it. Similarly, DFP also reacts with the active site of acetylcholine esterase in the synapses of neurons, and consequently is a potent neurotoxin, with a lethal dose of less than 100mg.|$|E
5|$|A variant, {{in which}} the motif is {{enclosed}} within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Burlington seems to have assumed it was so, in using a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House <b>above</b> <b>right).</b> Modern scholarship attributes the drawing to Scamozzi. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of Tottenham Park in Savernake Forest for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it up in his designs for the Houses of Parliament, and it appears in Kent's executed designs for the north front of Holkham Hall.|$|E

25|$|The {{diagonal}} {{and vertical}} members form the truss web, and carry the shear stress.

25|$|In Chigorin–Schlechter, Ostend 1905, (diagram at <b>above</b> <b>right),</b> a {{game between}} two of the leading players of the day, an unusual {{combination}} of stalemate and zugzwang enabled the great Schlechter to rescue a desperate position. Schlechter, in extreme , played 44...Qc7+! Chigorin, thinking Schlechter had blundered, responded 45.Qb6+??, seemingly forcing the trade of queens. Schlechter's 45...Ka8!! forced an immediate draw: 46.Qxc7 is stalemate, and 46.Ka6 Qc8+! 47.Ka5 allows a draw with either 47...Qc7! (zugzwang), when White cannot make progress, or 47...Qc3+! 48.Ka6 Qc8+! with a perpetual check.|$|E
25|$|A truss can {{be thought}} of as a beam where the web {{consists}} of a series of separate members instead of a continuous plate. In the truss, the lower horizontal member (the bottom chord) and the upper horizontal member (the top chord) carry tension and compression, fulfilling the same function as the flanges of an I-beam. Which chord carries tension and which carries compression depends on the overall direction of bending. In the truss pictured <b>above</b> <b>right,</b> the bottom chord is in tension, and the top chord in compression.|$|E

25|$|The {{conifers}} are now {{accepted as}} comprising seven families, {{with a total}} of 65–70 genera and 600–630 species (696 accepted names). The seven most distinct families are linked in the box <b>above</b> <b>right</b> and phylogenetic diagram left. In other interpretations, the Cephalotaxaceae may be better included within the Taxaceae, and some authors additionally recognize Phyllocladaceae as distinct from Podocarpaceae (in which it is included here). The family Taxodiaceae is here included in family Cupressaceae, but was widely recognized in the past and can still be found in many field guides. A new classification and linear sequence based on molecular data can be found in an article by Christenhusz etal.|$|E
25|$|The burning {{sensation}} in muscles during hard exercise {{can be attributed}} to the release of hydrogen ions during the shift to glucose fermentation from glucose oxidation to carbon dioxide and water, when aerobic metabolism can no longer keep pace with the energy demands of the muscles. These hydrogen ions form a part of lactic acid. The body falls back on this less efficient but faster method of producing ATP under low oxygen conditions. This is thought to have been the primary means of energy production in earlier organisms before oxygen reached high concentrations in the atmosphere between 2000 and 2500 million years ago (see diagram <b>above</b> <b>right),</b> and thus would represent a more ancient form of energy production than the aerobic replenishment of NAD+ in cells.|$|E
25|$|The fish swim in a grid {{where the}} {{distance}} between them {{is the same as the}} jump length of their prey, as indicated in the animation <b>above</b> <b>right.</b> In the animation, juvenile herring hunt the copepods in this synchronised way. The copepods sense with their antennae the pressure wave of an approaching herring and react with a fast escape jump. The length of the jump is fairly constant. The fish align themselves in a grid with this characteristic jump length. A copepod can dart about 80 times before it tires. After a jump, it takes it 60 milliseconds to spread its antennae again, and this time delay becomes its undoing, as the almost endless stream of herring allows a herring to eventually snap the copepod. A single juvenile herring could never catch a large copepod.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the fort}} remains buried {{underneath}} the medieval Castle Keep. Few excavations have taken place {{and there is little}} to see due to the castle and surrounding city centre buildings being built over the fort's layout. However, the fort's praetorium, principia and two granaries are known to be in the environs of the castle, and their outlines can be seen marked out in stone adjacent to the castle keep. The remains of an original milecastle were found behind the Newcastle Arts Centre, just off the A186 Westgate Road. The precise line of Hadrian's Wall in the vicinity {{of the fort}} has not been found, so it is not known for example if the fort was attached to the Wall; the artist's impression <b>above</b> <b>right</b> shows a gap.|$|E
25|$|In {{late medieval}} times a {{population}} increase and {{an expansion of}} church building took place in Great Britain inevitably encroaching on the territories of existing mother churches or minsters. Demands for autonomy from outlying settlements made minster officials feel that their authority was waning, as were their revenues, so they instituted corpse roads connecting outlying locations and their mother churches (at the heart of parishes) that alone held burial rights. For some parishioners, this decision meant that corpses had to be transported long distances, sometimes through difficult terrain: usually a corpse had to be carried unless the departed was a wealthy individual. An example would be the funeral way that runs from Rydal to Ambleside in the Lake District where a coffin stone (illustrated <b>above</b> <b>right),</b> on which the coffin was placed while the parishioners rested, still exists. Many of the 'new' churches were eventually granted burial rights and corpse roads ceased {{to be used as}} such.|$|E
25|$|In plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and phototrophic and chemoautotrophic proteobacteria, {{the enzyme}} usually {{consists}} of two types of protein subunit, called the large chain (L, about 55,000 Da) and the small chain (S, about 13,000 Da). The large-chain gene (rbcL) is encoded by the chloroplast DNA in plants. There are typically several related small-chain genes in the nucleus of plant cells, and the small chains are imported to the stromal compartment of chloroplasts from the cytosol by crossing the outer chloroplast membrane. The enzymatically active substrate (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate) binding sites {{are located in the}} large chains that form dimers as shown in Figure 1 (<b>above,</b> <b>right)</b> in which amino acids from each large chain contribute to the binding sites. A total of eight large-chains (= 4 dimers) and eight small chains assemble into a larger complex of about 540,000 Da. In some proteobacteria and dinoflagellates, enzymes consisting of only large subunits have been found.|$|E
