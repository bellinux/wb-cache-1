5|$|While Rastignac desires {{wealth and}} social status, Goriot longs {{only for the}} love of his daughters: <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> that borders on idolatry. Because he {{represents}} bourgeois wealth acquired through trade– and not aristocratic primitive accumulation– his daughters are happy to take his money, but will see him only in private. Even as he is dying in extreme poverty, {{at the end of the}} book, he sells his few remaining possessions to provide for his daughters so that they might look splendid at a ball.|$|E

My heart is with that poor people whose cause in words I have tried to plead, and who now, ignorant and docile, are just in that formative state in which whoever seizes has them.|$|E

5|$|Tiberius's move thus {{seemed to}} be an interim solution: he would hold power only until his stepsons would come of age, and then be swept aside. The promiscuous, and very public, {{behavior}} of his unhappily married wife, Julia, may have also played a part. Indeed, Tacitus calls it Tiberius' intima causa, his innermost reason for departing for Rhodes, and seems to ascribe the entire move to a hatred of Julia and <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> for Vipsania. Tiberius had found himself married to a woman he loathed, who publicly humiliated him with nighttime escapades in the Forum, and forbidden to see the woman he had loved.|$|E
5|$|Heathen {{influences}} were {{apparent in}} forms of black metal from the 1990s, where lyrics and themes often expressed <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> for a pre-Christian Northern past; {{the mass media}} typically associated this music genre with Satanism. The Pagan metal genre—which emerged from the fragmentation of the extreme metal scene in Northern Europe during the early 1990s—came {{to play an important}} role in the North European Pagan scene. Many musicians involved in Viking metal were also practicing Heathens, with many metal bands embracing the heroic masculinity embodied in Norse mythological figures like Odin and Thor. From the mid-1990s, the Internet greatly aided the propagation of Heathenry in various parts of the world. That decade also saw the strong growth of racist Heathenry among those incarcerated within the U.S. prison system as a result of outreach programs established by various Heathen groups, a project begun in the 1980s. During this period, many Heathen groups also began to interact increasingly with other ethnic-oriented Pagan groups in Eastern Europe, such as Lithuanian Romuva, and many joined the World Congress of Ethnic Religions upon its formation in 1998.|$|E
5|$|The {{relation}} {{of church and}} state in Zwingli's mind is best represented in a statue by the Wasserkirche, where he stands with a Bible {{in one hand and a}} sword in the other. For him, the church and state are one under the sovereign rule of God. The development of the complex relationship between church and state in Zwingli's view can only be understood by examining the context of his life, the city of Zürich, and the wider Swiss Confederation. His earliest writings before he became a reformer, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), reveal a patriotic love of his land, <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> for liberty, and opposition to the mercenary service where young Swiss citizens were sent to fight in foreign wars for the financial benefit of the state government. His life as a parish priest and an army chaplain helped to develop his concern for morality and justice. He saw his ministry not limited to a private sphere, but to the people as a whole.|$|E

Community practices such as singing songs together (kirtan or bhajan), praising or ecstatically celebrating the presence of god together, usually inside temples, but sometimes in open public are part of varying Vaishnava practices.

He made his major label debut with Being There in 1992. It was produced by Ben Wisch, to create more stripped-down arrangements.

25|$|Muhyiddin Muhammad b. 'Ali Ibn 'Arabi (or Ibn al-'Arabi) AH 561- AH 638 (July 28, 1165 – November 10, 1240) is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most important Sufi masters, although he never founded any order (tariqa). His writings, especially al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya and Fusus al-hikam, have been studied within all the Sufi orders as the clearest expression of tawhid (Divine Unity), though because of their recondite nature they were often only given to initiates. Later those who followed his teaching became known as the school of wahdat al-wujud (the Oneness of Being). He himself considered his writings to have been divinely inspired. As he expressed the Way to one of his close disciples, his legacy is that 'you should never ever abandon your servant-hood (ʿubudiyya), and that there may never be in your soul <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> for any existing thing'.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{rigorous}} debate in Indian literature on relative merits of these theoretical spiritual practices. For example, Chandogyopanishad suggests {{that those who}} engage in ritualistic offerings to gods and priests will fail in their spiritual practice, while those who engage in tapas will succeed; Svetasvataropanishad suggests that a successful spiritual practice requires <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> for truth, but warns of becoming 'false ascetic' who go through the mechanics of spiritual practice without meditating {{on the nature of}} Self and universal Truths. In the practice of Hinduism, suggest modern era scholars such as Vivekananda, the choice between the paths is up to the individual and a person's proclivities. Other scholars suggest that these Hindu spiritual practices are not mutually exclusive, but overlapping. These four paths of spirituality are also known in Hinduism outside India, such as in Balinese Hinduism, where it is called Catur Marga (literally: four paths).|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from a few}} early attempts, Hebel's {{began his}} {{literary}} work {{near the end of}} the 18th century. After returning to Karlsruhe from a trip to Wiesental in 1799, he began to write Allemannische Gedichte, inspired by <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> for his home. (Allemannische is the spelling he used; normally it has just one [...] "l".) The 32 poems [...] "for friends of the rural way of life" [...] were written in Alemannic, the local dialect of Wiesental. Hebel could not find a Basel publisher willing to produce the book in Alemannic, and the collection was only published in 1803 by Philip Macklot in Karlsruhe, after Hebel and his friends managed to collect enough advance subscriptions. The first edition was published anonymously, possibly because Hebel was concerned about getting a rustic image.|$|E

Varietys Andrew Barker summarized [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as a [...] "slow-building, Broadway-style showstopper" [...] that [...] "moves effortlessly from busy, literate verses to <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> pre-chorus and a belted-to-the-rafters refrain", incorporating [...] "dramatic" [...] violins into its orchestration. Described as a [...] "big ballad", the song pairs Ashman's lyrics about pining for life on land with Menken’s [...] "soaring melody", beginning with a musical motif that resembles the sound of flowing water, described by D23 as [...] "tinkling piano keystrokes". Both the song's music and vocals swell with [...] "passion and longing".|$|E
500|$|Although Game of Thrones was {{dismissed}} by some critics before it began, its {{success has been}} credited {{with an increase in}} the popularity of fantasy themes. On the eve of the second season's premiere, a CNN.com blog post by Joel Williams read, [...] "After this weekend, you may be hard pressed to find someone who isn't a fan of some form of epic fantasy" [...] and cited Ian Bogost as saying that the series continues a trend of successful screen adaptations beginning with Peter Jackson's 2001 The Lord of the Rings film trilogy and the Harry Potter films establishing fantasy as a mass-market genre; they are [...] "gateway drugs to fantasy fan culture". Its success in the face of its genre was attributed by writers to <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> for escapism in popular culture, frequent female nudity and a skill in balancing lighthearted and serious topics (dragons and politics, for example) which provided it with a prestige enjoyed by conventional, top-tier drama series.|$|E
500|$|The burial {{customs of}} the ancient Romans were {{influenced}} by both of the first significant cultures whose territories they conquered as their state expanded, namely the Greeks of Magna Graecia and the Etruscans. [...] The original Roman custom was cremation, after which the burnt remains were kept in a pot, ash-chest or urn, often in a columbarium; pre-Roman burials around Rome often used hut-urns—little pottery houses. [...] From about the 2nd centuryCE, inhumation (burial of unburnt remains) in sarcophagi, often elaborately carved, became more fashionable for those who could afford it. [...] Greek-style medallion portrait sculptures on a stela, or small mausoleum for the rich, housing either an urn or sarcophagus, were often placed in a location such as a roadside, {{where it would be}} very visible to the living and perpetuate the memory of the dead. [...] Often a couple are shown, signifying <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> for reunion in the afterlife rather than a double burial (see married couple funerary reliefs).|$|E
