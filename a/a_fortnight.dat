Welensky dispatched the Royal Rhodesian Air Force (RRAF) to assist in their evacuation, but was prevented by the British government from entering the Congo itself. Refugees fled by foot to Ndola in Northern Rhodesia, where RRAF planes picked them up and flew them to camps in Salisbury. More than 6,000 people were evacuated by the RRAF.|$|E
5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>fortnight,</b> Kumar met Balachander in Chennai {{and watched}} Uyarndha Manithan {{again for a}} second time to study his character.

5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} castle was 'tending to ruin', and {{following}} his {{victory in the}} English Civil War Oliver Cromwell decreed its destruction in 1655, a process which was completed within <b>a</b> <b>fortnight.</b> The castle had stood on the main route from Bristol to London, and following its destruction a commercial avenue opened along Castle Street from the mediaeval city towards Old Market. The demolition of Lawford's Gate at {{the eastern end of}} Old Market Street extended this into West Street, creating an uninterrupted route into the bustling heart of Bristol.|$|E
5|$|Earlier travels had exposed Géricault {{to victims}} of {{insanity}} and plague, and while researching the Méduse his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied the faces of dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for <b>a</b> <b>fortnight</b> drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.|$|E

Migrating birds and wintering birds often form large flocks, often {{in the company of}} Redwings.|$|E

However {{the battalion}} did not take part in direct combat, and during this time {{a number of the}} its non commissioned officers were allowed to apply for commissions in British Army units.|$|E
5|$|Operation Chronicle, the {{landings}} at Kiriwina and Woodlark Islands, was the VII Amphibious Force's first operation, presented {{no great}} difficulty as the islands {{were known to}} be unoccupied. However half the assault troops experienced seasickness, problems were encountered with clearing the sand bar at the entrance to Guasopa Harbor, and Barbey's decision to land at night and withdraw before dawn in order to avoid encountering Japanese aircraft highlighted the inexperience of his crews and deficiencies in their training. Unloading activities on the coral-fringed Kiriwina dragged on for <b>a</b> <b>fortnight.</b>|$|E
