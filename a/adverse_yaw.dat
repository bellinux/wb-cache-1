5|$|In air combat, the Phantom's {{greatest}} advantage was its thrust, which {{permitted a}} skilled pilot to {{engage and disengage}} from the fight at will. As a massive fighter aircraft designed to fire radar-guided missiles from beyond visual range, it lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents and was subject to <b>adverse</b> <b>yaw</b> during hard maneuvering. Although thus subject to irrecoverable spins during aileron rolls, pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy to fly {{on the edge of}} its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with leading edge slats on the wing, greatly improving high angle of attack maneuverability at the expense of top speed.|$|E
5|$|The patent {{illustrates}} a non-powered flying machine—namely, the 1902 glider. The patent's importance {{lies in its}} claim {{of a new and}} useful method of controlling a flying machine, powered or not. The technique of wing-warping is described, but the patent explicitly states that other methods instead of wing-warping could be used for adjusting the outer portions of a machine's wings to different angles on the right and left sides to achieve lateral (roll) control. The concept of varying the angle presented to the air near the wingtips, by any suitable method, is central to the patent. The patent also describes the steerable rear vertical rudder and its innovative use in combination with wing-warping, enabling the airplane to make a coordinated turn, a technique that prevents hazardous <b>adverse</b> <b>yaw,</b> the problem Wilbur had when trying to turn the 1901 glider. Finally, the patent describes the forward elevator, used for ascending and descending.|$|E

40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} {{investigation}} {{has been made}} in the Langley Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at Mach numbers (M) from 1. 6 to 4. 5 to define the control effectiveness of a lifting-body configuration (HL- 20) in the supersonic speed range. The lifting body is being considered as a possible future crewed spacecraft. The configuration has a low aspect ratio body with a flat undersurface. Three fins, a small centerline fin and two outboard tip fins set at dihedral angles (Γ) of 50 °, are mounted on the aft body. The control surfaces consist of elevons on the outboard fins and four body flaps, two on the upper and two on the lower aft body. An all movable center fin was used for yaw control. Tests were made with elevons and body flaps deflected to ± 30 ° and the center fin deflected to 5 °. Almost full negative body flap deflection was required to trim the HL- 20 (moment reference center at 0. 54 -percent body length from nose) to positive values of lift in the M range from approximately 1. 6 to 2. 5. Elevons were about twice as effective as body flaps. The elevons were effective as a roll control, but because of Γ, they produced about as much <b>adverse</b> <b>yawing</b> moment as favorable rolling moment. The body flaps produced less rolling moment and much less <b>adverse</b> <b>yawing</b> moment than the elevons. The yaw effectiveness of the all movable center fin was essentially constant over the angle of attack range at each M. The value of yawing moment, however, was small.

25|$|Its {{design was}} based on the {{previous}} Rs.III, differing primarily in having a narrower hull fitted with sponsons and stressed skin structure, with some minor tidying of the design. It was a braced parasol monoplane with the fuselage mounted on the wing above both engine nacelles and hull. The four engines were mounted in push-pull pairs in nacelles large enough to allow in flight access — a requirement of the original Riesenflugzeug giant aircraft type specification by IdFlieg in 1915 — between the hull and the wing, and staggered to allow propeller disks to overlap slightly so as to reduce <b>adverse</b> <b>yaw</b> when an engine was not running.|$|E
25|$|During takeoff, {{both the}} ailerons and flaps are lowered, {{which is a}} {{relatively}} uncommon design approach but results in substantially elevated STOL performance. The flaps can be deployed to an extreme range, extending out at full to a 58 degree position; the flight manual notes that the full setting is recommended only for performing emergency landings. In the skies, the Beaver {{is relatively easy to}} handle, having been described as possessing light and comfortable controls; however, effective application of the rudder is necessitated in order to counteract <b>adverse</b> <b>yaw.</b> It should be flown with a relatively nose-low pitch attitude to maintain airspeed.

The investigation included determination of the rolling and yawing characteristics of the airplane in abrupt aileron rolls with the slotted flap at various settings ranging from 0 degree to about 40 degrees. The results showed that the effectiveness of the ailerons was greatly reduced at flap deflections greater than about 20 degrees.

The first Badger flew on 4 February 1919 but crashed on this first flight with fuel supply problems. It was rebuilt with a larger rudder and delivered to the Air Board eleven days later. The second, Jupiter-engined Badger, flew on 24 May but was re-engined with a Dragonfly and was purchased by the Air Board in September. It had full armament and a fixed, rounded fin, introduced {{to cope with the}} heavier Jupiter engine. The Badger proved to have a lateral stability problem, an <b>adverse</b> <b>yaw</b> effect caused by aileron drag, and because of this, the third machine was not accepted by the Air Board.

25|$|A rudder is {{a primary}} control surface used to steer a ship, boat, submarine, hovercraft, aircraft, or other {{conveyance}} that moves through a fluid medium (generally air or water). On an aircraft the rudder is used primarily to counter <b>adverse</b> <b>yaw</b> and p-factor and is not the primary control used to turn the airplane. A rudder operates by redirecting the fluid past the hull (watercraft) or fuselage, thus imparting a turning or yawing motion to the craft. In basic form, a rudder is a flat plane or sheet of material attached with hinges to the craft's stern, tail, or after end. Often rudders are shaped so as to minimize hydrodynamic or aerodynamic drag. On simple watercraft, a tiller—essentially, a stick or pole acting as a lever arm—may {{be attached to the}} top of the rudder to allow it to be turned by a helmsman. In larger vessels, cables, pushrods, or hydraulics may be used to link rudders to steering wheels. In typical aircraft, the rudder is operated by pedals via mechanical linkages or hydraulics.|$|E

40|$|A 0. 0196 -scale {{model of}} the HL- 20 lifting-body, one of several {{configurations}} proposed for future crewed spacecraft, was tested in the Langley 31 -Inch Mach 10 Tunnel. The purpose of the tests {{was to determine the}} effectiveness of fin-mounted elevons, a lower surface flush-mounted body flap, and a flush-mounted yaw controller at hypersonic speeds. The nominal angle-of-attack range, representative of hypersonic entry, was 2 deg to 41 deg, the sideslip angles were 0 deg, 2 deg, and - 2 deg, and the test Reynolds number was 1. 06 x 10 E 6 based on model reference length. The aerodynamic, longitudinal, and lateral control effectiveness along with surface oil flow visualizations are presented and discussed. The configuration was longitudinally and laterally stable at the nominal center of gravity. The primary longitudinal control, the fin-mounted elevons, could not trim the model to the desired entry angle of attack of 30 deg.

40|$|The {{circular}} body configuration is {{a generic}} single- or multi-stage reusable Earth-to-orbit transport. A thick clipped-delta wing {{is the major}} lifting surface. For directional control, three different vertical fin arrangements were investigated: a conventional aft-mounted center fin, wingtip fins, and a nose-mounted fin. The tests were conducted in the Langley Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel. The configuration is longitudinally stable about the estimated center of gravity of 0. 72 body length up to a Mach number of about 3. 0. Above Mach 3. 0, the model is longitudinally unstable at low angles of attack but has a stable secondary trim point at angles of attack above 30 deg. The model has sufficient pitch control authority with elevator and body flap to produce stable trim over the test range. The model with the center fin is directionally stable at low angles of attack up to a Mach number of 3. 90. The rudder-like surfaces on the tip fins and the all-movable nose fin are designed as active controls to produce artificial directional stability and are effective in producing yawing moment.

500|$|Orville {{apparently}} visualized {{that the}} fixed rudder resisted {{the effect of}} corrective wing-warping when attempting to level off from a turn. He wrote in his diary that {{on the night of}} October 2, [...] "I studied out a new vertical rudder". The brothers then decided to make the rear rudder movable to solve the problem. They hinged the rudder and connected it to the pilot's warping [...] "cradle", so a single movement by the pilot simultaneously controlled wing-warping and rudder deflection. Tests while gliding proved that the trailing edge of the rudder should be turned away from whichever end of the wings had more drag (and lift) due to warping. The opposing pressure produced by turning the rudder enabled corrective wing-warping to reliably restore level flight after a turn or a wind disturbance. Furthermore, when the glider banked into a turn, rudder pressure overcame the effect of differential drag and pointed the nose of the aircraft {{in the direction of the}} turn, eliminating <b>adverse</b> <b>yaw.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Nowhere in {{the patent}} {{is there a}} {{description}} of mounting the ailerons on the trailing edges of the airplane's wings, where they would have induced <b>adverse</b> <b>yaw,</b> but only [...] "...on arms projecting from the vessel laterally".

2500|$|In practice, both aileron and {{rudder control}} input are used {{together}} to turn an aircraft, the ailerons imparting roll, the rudder imparting yaw, and also compensating for a phenomenon called <b>adverse</b> <b>yaw.</b> A rudder alone will turn a conventional fixed-wing aircraft, {{but much more}} slowly than if ailerons are also used in conjunction. [...] Use of rudder and ailerons together produces co-ordinated turns, in which the longitudinal axis of the aircraft {{is in line with}} the arc of the turn, neither slipping (under-ruddered), nor skidding (over-ruddered). Improperly ruddered turns at low speed can precipitate a spin which can be dangerous at low altitudes.|$|E

40|$|Vortex {{asymmetry}} on axisymmetric pointed forebodies at high {{angles of}} incidence results in side forces and <b>adverse</b> <b>yawing</b> moments even in symmetric flight. An experimental investigation {{has been carried}} out at low speeds to study the effectiveness of axial nose blowing against the oncoming flow for side force control on two slender cones. Tests were made on the 8 and 12 deg cone models with (circular) jet flow over a Reynolds number range of 0. 4 × 10 ^ 6 to 5. 4 × 10 ^ 6. Jet-to-freestream velocity ratio was varied up to 2. 0, and the blowing diameter was varied as well. Force measurements were carried over the incidence range of 0 to 45 deg, and limited surface pressure distributions were obtained on the 12 deg cone model. The results explicitly show the effectiveness of nose blowing for side force control over a wide range of Reynolds numbers, and minimum side force was reached around a jet velocity ratio of 1. 0. An important result is that the side force reduction correlates with jet velocity ratio in the range of parameters studied. Broad similarities in the trend of side force reduction with the nose blowing and the nose bluntness suggest that the interaction of axial jet with freestream flow results, possibly, in what we may call "fluid dynamic blunting"...|$|R
40|$|Discussed {{here are}} a series of {{systematic}} tests being conducted to compare different lateral control devices with particular reference to their effectiveness at high angles of attack. The present tests were made with six different forms of floating tip ailerons of symmetrical section. The tests showed the effect of the various ailerons on the general performance characteristics of the wing, and on the lateral controllability and stability characteristics. In addition, the hinge moments were measured for the most interesting cases. The results are compared with those for a rectangular wing with ordinary ailerons and also with those for a rectangular wing having full-chord floating tip ailerons. Practically all the floating tip ailerons gave satisfactory rolling moments at all angles of attack {{and at the same time}} gave no <b>adverse</b> <b>yawing</b> moments of appreciable magnitude. The general performance characteristics with the floating tip ailerons, however, were relatively poor, especially the rate of climb. None of the floating tip ailerons entirely eliminated the auto rotational moments at angles of attack above the stall, but all of them gave lower moments than a plain wing. Some of the floating ailerons fluttered if given sufficiently large deflection, but this could have been eliminated by moving the hinge axis of the ailerons forward. Considering all points including hinge moments, the floating tip ailerons on the wing with 5 : 1 taper are probably the best of those which were tested...|$|R

2500|$|The Konsul was a wood framed {{aircraft}} with a high, cantilever, single spar wing with stressed 3-ply covering {{from the}} spar to {{the leading edge}} and fabric covered aft. It was built in three parts, an 8m (26ft3in) inner section with a box spar and outer panels with an I-section one. The wing had a thick and strongly cambered profile, using the then new Göttingen 535 airfoil with its high lift to drag ratio that attracted many pre-World War II sailplane designers. The long wings had constant chord except for tapered tips, where the wing decreased in thickness. There was no dihedral. [...] Half span, large area ailerons had angled hinges attached to the spar at its tip and, in the early flight tests, projected well beyond the fixed wing tip.

50|$|The ailerons {{primarily}} control roll. Whenever lift is increased, {{induced drag}} is also increased. When the stick is moved left {{to roll the}} aircraft to the left, the right aileron is lowered which increases lift on the right wing and therefore increases induced drag on the right wing. Using ailerons causes <b>adverse</b> <b>yaw,</b> meaning {{the nose of the}} aircraft yaws in a direction opposite to the aileron application. When moving the stick to the left to bank the wings, <b>adverse</b> <b>yaw</b> moves the nose of the aircraft to the right. <b>Adverse</b> <b>yaw</b> is more pronounced for light aircraft with long wings, such as gliders.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of flight tests made to determine the effect of slots and flaps on the lateral control of a low-wing monoplane. Maximum angular accelerations in roll and yaw produced by sudden application of the ailerons and maximum accelerations in yaw produced by sudden application of the rudder during gliding flight were recorded for the following wing arrangements: (a) no auxiliary device; (b) full-span slots; (c) plain flaps; (d) flaps and full-span slots; (e) wing-tip slots. Rolling- and yawing-moment coefficients were derived from the accelerations. The full span slots and the flaps each had about the same influence on the aileron rolling moments. At values of the lift coefficient obtainable with the plain wing, the effect of these devices was negligible. At the higher lift coefficients obtainable with these devices, the rolling-moment coefficients increased slightly but, despite this increase, the aileron effectiveness progressively decreased with increasing lift coefficient, owing to the corresponding reduction in air speed. In the range covered by the tests, the effectiveness of the controls was appreciably reduced by the wing-tip slots. The <b>adverse</b> <b>yawing</b> moment of the ailerons experienced at the large lift coefficients obtained with the flaps was appreciably less than at similar lift coefficients obtained with either full-span or wing-tip slots. The yawing moments produced by the rudder were only slightly affected by the use of the auxiliary devices. The airplane was found to be laterally unstable with all combinations tested. Because of the angular velocities acquired in the time taken to deflect the ailerons the rolling moments recorded in flight were only about two thirds the values that would have been obtained with the wing restrained as in wind-tunnel tests...|$|R

Several hypothetical assumptions of piloting procedure, each of which is considered to represent a component of the actual procedure, are studied.

50|$|At such low speeds, {{aircraft}} {{flight control}} surfaces begin to lose their effectiveness. Ailerons, in particular, are susceptible. The rudder remains the most efficient flight surface and the <b>adverse</b> effect of <b>yaw</b> which alters bank angle is useful for altering {{the direction of the}} aircraft without the need for aileron inputs. If the ailerons are used excessively it is probable that one wing will stall (due to the increased angle of attack of the wing with the downward aileron) and send the aircraft into a spin. In modern aircraft, flight envelope protection in the aircraft flight control system prevents a pilot from controlling their aircraft into doing this.|$|R

40|$|The blended-wing-body (BWB) {{configuration}} {{appears as}} a promising contender {{for the next generation}} of large transport aircraft. The idea of blending the wing with the fuselage and eliminating the tail is not new, it has long been known that tailless aircraft can suffer from stability and control problems that must be addressed early in the design. This thesis is concerned with identifying and then evaluating the flight dynamics, stability, flight controls and handling qualities of a generic BWB large transport aircraft concept. Longitudinal and lateral-directional static and dynamic stability analysis using aerodynamic data representative of different BWB configurations enabled a better understanding of the BWB aircraft characteristics and identification of the mechanisms that influence its behaviour. The static stability studies revealed that there is limited control power both for the longitudinal and lateral-directional motion. The solution for the longitudinal problem is to limit the static margins to small values around the neutral point, and even to use negative static margins. However, for the directional control problem the solution is to investigate alternative ways of generating directional control power. Additional investigation uncovered dynamic instability due to the low and negative longitudinal and directional static stability. Furthermore, <b>adverse</b> roll and <b>yaw</b> responses were found to aileron inputs. The implementation of a pitch rate command/attitude hold flight control system (FCS) improved the longitudinal basic BWB characteristics to satisfactory levels, or Level 1, flying and handling qualities (FHQ). Although the lateral-directional command and stability FCS also improved the BWB flying and handling qualities it was demonstrated that Level 1 was not achieved for all flight conditions due to limited directional control power. The possibility to use the conventional FHQs criteria and requirements for FCS design and FHQs assessment on BWB configurations was also investigated. Hence, a limited set of simulation trials were undertaken using an augmented BWB configuration. The longitudinal Bandwidth/Phase delay/Gibson dropback criteria, as suggested by the military standards, together with the Generic Control Anticipation Parameter (GCAP) proved possible to use to assess flying and handling qualities of BWB aircraft. For the lateral-directional motion the MIL-F- 8785 C criteria were used. Although it is possible to assess the FHQ of BWB configuartions using these criteria, more research is recommended specifically on the lateral-directional FHQs criteria and requirements of highly augmented large transport aircraft.
