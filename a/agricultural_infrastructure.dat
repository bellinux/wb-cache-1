5|$|Twenty-fourhours {{after the}} passage of the hurricane, workers had {{restored}} power to 70% of the affected residents in Sinaloa, and by six days after the storm, electrical service was completely restored. The damage to the federal highway between Culiacán and Los Mochis along the coastal region of Sinaloa was restored about 48hours {{after the passage}} of the hurricane. The rehabilitation of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>infrastructure</b> began immediately, and most of the drainage networks were repaired by about two weeks after the hurricane. About half of the damaged railways were repaired by about a month after the storm. The total cost for reconstruction and aid amounted to about $18.5million (1998USD, 175million 1998MXN, $23.3million 2007USD), about 94% from federal funds and the rest from state funding.

40|$|The {{study has}} {{estimated}} {{the extent of}} investment made in promotion of marketing infrastructure {{in the country and}} growth in public and private investments. It has also examined state-wise spread of private and public investments in <b>agricultural</b> marketing <b>infrastructure,</b> its composition and share and has investigated whether private investment induces pubic investment or vice versa. Of the total investment of Rs 157652. 30 lakh made for the development of <b>agricultural</b> marketing <b>infrastructure,</b> Madhya Pradesh has accounted for the maximum (36 %) share, followed by Tamil Nadu (18 %) and Andhra Pradesh (13. 5 %). West Bengal has accounted for the lowest share. The analysis has indicated that there is a strong complementarity between private and public investments and as soon as private investment comes, public investment also starts pouring in. On investigating whether public investment is dependent on private investment or vice versa, the study has revealed that private investment induces public investment. The study has further indicated that in <b>agricultural</b> marketing <b>infrastructure,</b> private investment has taken a lead, which is a welcome change because private investment is more efficiently used as compared to public investment. To give further fillip to private investment in <b>agricultural</b> marketing <b>infrastructure,</b> the study has provided certain suggestions. Marketing,...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} use data from China between 1929 and 1933 and {{provides}} new empirical evidence to {{the debate over the}} impact of land ownership and land-renting systems on agricultural productivity. Design/methodology/approach – The authors estimate the OLS regression to determine the relationship between land ownership (and land-renting systems) and farmers' productivity. Findings – The findings suggest that land ownership was not a major factor in determining farmers' productivity; instead, <b>agricultural</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and institutions had the greatest influence on agricultural productivity. Furthermore, different renting systems generated different impacts on farmers' behavior: sharecropping reduced farmers' productivity while fixed rental contracts had no significant impact on farmers' productivity. Practical implications – This paper has two important policy implications for developing countries. First, agricultural policy that aims to raise agricultural productivity should focus more on improving <b>agricultural</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and institutions than on blindly supporting land privatization. Second, policymakers should promote fixed rental contracts over share contracts because fixed rental contracts were shown to have a smaller adverse impact on farmers' incentives. Originality/value – This paper uses data from China and provides new evidence on the relative importance of land ownership and agricultural infrastructures/institutions in agricultural production. China is a country with a long agricultural history and a long-standing well-developed tenancy system. The case of China may therefore provide answers to policymakers in other developing countries.

25|$|Operation Barga (and West Bengal's land {{reforms in}} general) {{have been criticized}} for their small scope and {{inability}} to solve all the major problems. This criticism has been mainly due to policies not accounting for the high landmass-population ratio in Bengal (the highest in the country), the small and highly segregated land holding patterns and failure of the Government to develop agri-industrial markets for farm produce. These failures, critics contend, have distributed poverty rather than creating prosperity. They point out that in spite of these measures, Bengal’s <b>agricultural</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and financial situation is no better than in most other states.|$|E
500|$|TNI strategists {{implemented}} {{a strategy of}} attrition against the Falintil beginning in September 1977. This was accomplished by rendering the central regions of East Timor unable to sustain human life through napalm attacks, chemical warfare and destruction of crops. This was {{to be done in}} order to force the population to surrender into the custody of Indonesian forces and deprive the Falintil of food and population. Catholic officials in East Timor called this strategy an [...] "encirclement and annihilation" [...] campaign. 35,000 ABRI troops surrounded areas of Fretilin support and killed of men, women, and children. Air and naval bombardments were followed by ground troops, who destroyed villages and <b>agricultural</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> Thousands of people may have been killed during this period. In early 1978, the entire civilian population of Arsaibai village, near the Indonesian border, was killed for supporting Fretilin after being bombarded and starved. The success of the 'encirclement and annihilation' campaign led to the 'final cleansing campaign', in which children and men would be forced to hold hands and march in front of Indonesian units searching for Fretilin members. When Fretilin members were found, the members would be forced to surrender or to fire on their own people.|$|E

Transient impact events, despite their brevity, can have significant long-term impact on society, particularly if they occur {{in the context of}} ongoing, protracted environmental change. Major climate events can affect human activities in critical conjunctures that shape particular trajectories of social development. Here we report variable human responses to major environmental events in the Andes with a particular emphasis on the period from anno Domini 500 – 1500 on the desert north coast of Perú. We show that preindustrial agrarian societies implemented distinct forms of anticipatory response to environmental change and uncertainty.

50|$|The {{process of}} Flurbereinigung was spurred heavily after the Second World War. In that {{time there was}} a great need for {{inexpensive}} agricultural products. At the same time the population in West Germany underwent a rapid increase caused by millions of refugees from the former eastern territories of Germany. The idea was first to restructure the land properties by amalgamating different fields under the same property that were formerly geographically dispersed, thus reducing labor and costs of cultivating those fields. As a second step, <b>agricultural</b> <b>infrastructures</b> like dirt roads and farming machinery were heavily improved. That process also included regulating streams and straightening country roads. As a result, the Flurbereinigung radically reshaped large areas of German agriculture, including the German wine industry. First taking shape in land consolidation legislation passed in the 1950s as part of an overhaul of the structuring of German agriculture, the Flurbereinigung would see many landscapes rearranged and physically reshaped, for example with respect to building access roads to make agriculture more effective.|$|R
