Colour vision appears to vary from species to species, for example being present in O. aegina but absent in O. vulgaris. Attached {{to the brain}} are two special organs called statocysts (sac-like structures containing a mineralised mass and sensitive hairs), that allow the octopus to sense the orientation of its body. They provide information on {{the position of the}} body relative to gravity and can detect <b>angular</b> <b>acceleration.</b> An autonomic response keeps the octopus's eyes oriented so that the pupil is always horizontal. Octopuses may also use the statocyst to hear sound. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz, and hears best at 600Hz.|$|E

25|$|The {{speed of}} {{rotation}} is given by the angular frequency (rad/s) or frequency (turn/s, turns per minute), or period (seconds, days, etc.). The time-rate of change of angular frequency is <b>angular</b> <b>acceleration</b> (rad/s²), This change is caused by torque.

25|$|The {{conservation}} of angular momentum explains the <b>angular</b> <b>acceleration</b> of an ice skater as she brings {{her arms and}} legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of the mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is the product of moment of inertia and angular velocity, if the angular momentum remains constant (is conserved), then the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater must increase.|$|E
25|$|They {{reported}} that the aircraft, flying in clouds, may have been thrown into an unusual attitude. This resulted in buffeting of the tailplane, causing the port tailplane to fail, and the aircraft entered a dive. The flutter effect on the starboard tailplane caused it to fail next. The aircraft was moving at high speed and reached a stalling attitude, causing the port wing to break away. The rapid <b>angular</b> <b>acceleration</b> caused the engine supports to break and the engine to fall away. Nine other causes were investigated but dismissed by the committee.|$|E
25|$|The iPhone 4 {{introduces}} a gyroscopic sensor that detects 3-axis <b>angular</b> <b>acceleration</b> around the X, Y and Z axes, enabling precise calculation of yaw, pitch, and roll. The gyroscope complements the accelerometer, a sensor {{that has been}} present since the original iPhone, which detects the device's acceleration, shake, vibration shock, or fall by detecting linear acceleration along one of three axes (X, Y and Z). The combined data from the accelerometer and the gyroscope provides detailed and precise information about the device's 6-axis movement in space. The 3 axes of the gyroscope combined with the 3 axes of the accelerometer enable the device to recognize approximately how far, fast, and in which direction it has moved in space.|$|E

25|$|Vectors are {{fundamental}} {{in the physical}} sciences. They {{can be used to}} represent any quantity that has magnitude, has direction, and which adheres to the rules of vector addition. An example is velocity, the magnitude of which is speed. For example, the velocity 5 meters per second upward could be represented by the vector (0,5) (in 2 dimensions with the positive y axis as 'up'). Another quantity represented by a vector is force, since it has a magnitude and direction and follows the rules of vector addition. Vectors also describe many other physical quantities, such as linear displacement, displacement, linear acceleration, <b>angular</b> <b>acceleration,</b> linear momentum, and angular momentum. Other physical vectors, such as the electric and magnetic field, are represented as a system of vectors at each point of a physical space; that is, a vector field. Examples of quantities that have magnitude and direction but fail to follow the rules of vector addition: Angular displacement and electric current. Consequently, these are not vectors.|$|E
25|$|In fact, {{the human}} body has seven sensory systems – not five. The sixth and seventh systems are the senses of motion located in the inner ear. The former signals the {{beginning}} and end of rotation and the latter signals body tilt relative to gravity as well as body translation. The seventh system no longer provides tilt information in weightlessness; however, it does continue to signal translation, so the afferent signals to the CNS are confusing. The experience of living and working in space alters the way the CNS interprets the otolith organ signals during linear acceleration. Although the perception is fairly accurate when subjects are exposed to <b>angular</b> <b>acceleration</b> in yaw in-flight, there are disturbances during angular rotation in pitch and roll, and during linear acceleration along the body transversal and longitudinal axes. Perception of body motion is also altered during the same motion immediately after landing. There is an adaptation to weightlessness in orbit that carries over to post-flight reactions to linear acceleration.|$|E

The resultant linear and <b>angular</b> <b>accelerations</b> in the coronal plane were significantly higher for an impact {{to the side of}} the head when compared with frontal impacts. Neck axial forces were recorded, ranging from 2. 1 to 3. 4 kN. Linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the correlation coefficients that characterised the relationships between dummy responses and impact and sled velocities.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{trajectory}} optimization for computing smooth collision free trajectories for nonholonomic curvature bounded vehicles among static and dynamic obstacles. One {{of the key}} novelties of our formulation is a hierarchal optimization routine which alternately operates {{in the space of}} <b>angular</b> <b>accelerations</b> and linear velocities. That is, the optimization has a two layer structure wherein <b>angular</b> <b>accelerations</b> are optimized keeping the linear velocities fixed and vice versa. If the vehicle/obstacles are modeled as circles than the velocity optimization layer can be shown to have the computationally efficient difference of convex structure commonly observed for linear systems. This leads to a less conservative approximation as compared to that obtained by approximating each polygon individually through its circumscribing circle. On the other hand, it leads to optimization problem with less number of constraints as compared to that obtained when approximating polygons as multiple overlapping circles. We use the proposed trajectory optimization as the basis for constructing a Model Predictive Control framework for navigating an autonomous car in complex scenarios like overtaking, lane changing and merging. Moreover, we also highlight the advantages provided by the alternating optimization routine. Specifically, we show it produces trajectories which have comparable arc lengths and smoothness as compared to those produced with joint simultaneous optimization in the space of <b>angular</b> <b>accelerations</b> and linear velocities. However, importantly, the alternating optimization provides some gain in computational time. Comment: 6 page...|$|R
