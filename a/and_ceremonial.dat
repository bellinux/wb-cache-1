40|$|We {{suggest a}} number of propositions related to the study and {{performance}} of organizational exit rites <b>and</b> <b>ceremonials</b> based on multi-disciplinary literature. Effective rites <b>and</b> <b>ceremonials</b> should incorporate all three phases of a rite of passage: rites of separation, transition rites, and rites of incorporation.

In addition, we examine {{a number of}} characteristics that affect the exiting and surviving employees including the formality of the ceremonial, degree of participation by stakeholders, and fulfillment of the exiting employee’s goals. Lastly, implications for management and future research are suggested...|$|R
