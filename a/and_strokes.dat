5|$|Aspirin's {{popularity}} declined {{after the}} development of acetaminophen/paracetamol in 1956 and ibuprofen in 1962. In the 1960s and 1970s, John Vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin's effects, while clinical trials and other studies from the 1960s to the 1980s established aspirin's efficacy as an anti-clotting agent that {{reduces the risk of}} clotting diseases. Aspirin sales revived considerably in the last decades of the twentieth century, and remain strong in the twenty-first with widespread use as a preventive treatment for heart attacks <b>and</b> <b>strokes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before mating, {{males and}} females may stridulate, or vibrate the objects they are on. In the Meloidae, the male climbs onto the dorsum of the female <b>and</b> <b>strokes</b> his {{antennae}} on her head, palps, and antennae. In Eupompha, the male draws his antennae along his longitudinal vertex. They may not mate at all {{if they do not}} perform the precopulatory ritual. This mating behaviour may be different amongst dispersed populations of the same species. For example, the mating of a Russian population of tansy beetle (Chysolina graminis) is preceded by an elaborate ritual involving the male tapping the female's eyes, pronotum and antennae with its antennae, which is not evident in the population of this species in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of using}} aspirin to prevent {{clotting}} diseases (such as heart attacks <b>and</b> <b>strokes)</b> was revived in the 1960s, when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that aspirin had an anti-adhesive effect on blood platelets (and unlike other potential antiplatelet drugs, aspirin had low toxicity). Medical Research Council haematologist John O'Brien picked up on Weiss's finding and, in 1963, began working with epidemiologist Peter Elwood on aspirin's anti-thrombosis drug potential. Elwood began a large-scale trial of aspirin as a preventive drug for heart attacks. Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide aspirin tablets, and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a double-blind controlled study—heart attack survivors were statistically {{more likely to suffer}} a second attack, greatly reducing the number of patients necessary to reliably detect whether aspirin had an effect on heart attacks. The study began in February 1971, though the researchers soon had to break the double-blinding when a study by American epidemiologist Hershel Jick suggested that aspirin prevented heart attacks but suggested that the heart attacks were more deadly. Jick had found that fewer aspirin-takers were admitted to his hospital for heart attacks than non-aspirin-takers, and one possible explanation was that aspirin caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital; Elwood's initial results ruled out that explanation. When the Elwood trial ended in 1973, it showed a modest but not statistically significant reduction in heart attacks among the group taking aspirin.|$|E

Besides diabetes, other factors that may also increase high blood pressure include obesity, insulin resistance and high cholesterol levels.

25|$|In ancient China, the Jiǎgǔwén {{characters}} {{carved on}} ox scapula and tortoise plastrons showed {{no indication of}} stroke order.

Although the brush-written stroke order is not discernible after carving, there exists some evidence {{that it was not}} entirely idiosyncratic: a few of the characters, often marginal administrative notations recording the provenance of the shells or bones, were not later recarved, and the stroke order of these characters tends to resemble traditional and modern stroke order. For those characters (the vast majority) which were later engraved into the hard surface using a knife, perhaps by a separate individual, there is evidence (from incompletely engraved pieces) that in at least some cases all the strokes running one way were carved, then the piece was turned, <b>and</b> <b>strokes</b> running another way were then carved.|$|E

The Ohio Plan to Prevent Heart Disease <b>and</b> <b>Stroke</b> 2008 – 2012, 2 nd Edition is the result of such a cooperative effort. Public and private organizations; professional associations and educational institutions; faith-based health services; and major medical facilities represented on the Ohio Heart Disease <b>and</b> <b>Stroke</b> Prevention Council combined their efforts to develop goals, objectives and activities that will reduce disability and death for Ohioans. Reducing the burden of heart disease <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> is no simple task.

The Ohio Plan to Prevent Heart Disease <b>and</b> <b>Stroke</b> 2008 – 2012, 2 nd Edition was developed to provide a blueprint to address heart disease <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> risk factors, disease burden and mortality rates.
