By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And there was a man taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them out. I was sitting up in the bleachers and jumped down — I was three-quarters of the way up. You jump down and it was all straw underneath. There was a young man, <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> <b>and</b> he had a pocketknife. And he slit the tent, took my arm and pulled me out.|$|E

Bushnell’s experience in the amusement park industry, {{as well as his}} fondness of The Walt Disney Company, was influential in the conceptualization of the Pizza Time Theatre concept. The first location opened in San Jose, California in 1977, and was labeled as the first family restaurant to integrate food, cheap animated entertainment, and an indoor arcade. In 1978, Bushnell purchased the Pizza Time Theatre concept from Atari's then-corporate parent, Warner Communications. Gene Landrum then resigned from Atari and was made President and Chief Operating Officer of Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre.|$|E

Around this time, an unknown McCartney original was recorded, {{with the help of}} engineer Geoff Emerick. The songs that McCartney would work on were voted upon democratically: McCartney comments, [...] "I pulled up some [...] from my memories, when I was <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>and</b> we had family sing-songs, which was the original inspiration for the whole idea, I said to Tom, 'Let's look at these ones.

Tony Iommi is the king of the heavy riff." [...] former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash said of the Paranoid album: [...] "There's just something about that whole record that, when you're <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>and</b> you're turned onto it, it's like a whole different world. It just opens up your mind to another dimension...Paranoid is the whole Sabbath experience; very indicative of what Sabbath meant at the time.

500|$|... "No Future" [...] {{was nearly}} {{cut from the}} record.

[...] "Home Is Such a Lonely Place" [...] is a ballad with [...] "clean arpeggiated finger-picking guitars with strings underneath it." [...] Its lyrics are themed around lost love; it emerged from an early-morning coffee meeting between Hoppus and Feldmann, who both imagined how lonely their homes would be when their children grow up and move away. [...] "Kings of the Weekend" [...] was also nearly moved off the final track listing, but kept because of its recognizable guitar riff. Feldmann described it as [...] "the party song. We've all had day jobs {{and we all know}} what it's like to have that day off to do what we want." [...] "Teenage Satellites" [...] is based around [...] "being <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>and</b> not knowing who you are, not having enough courage to say what you mean." [...] It was the last song recorded for the album, and it was at first written without a hook or melody in mind. [...] "Left Alone" [...] made the album cut because the band liked Skiba's vocal performance. [...] "Rabbit Hole" [...] was one of Hoppus' favorites, and revolves around [...] "standing your ground and not falling for people's nonsense." ...|$|E

500|$|On 18 February 1972 {{the state}} formed the Bangladesh Women's Rehabilitation Board, which was tasked with helping {{the victims of}} rape and {{to help with the}} {{adoption}} programme. Several international agencies took part in the adoption programme, such as Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity. The majority of the war babies were adopted in the Netherlands and Canada as the state wished to remove the reminders of Pakistan from the newly formed nation. However, not all women wanted their child taken, and some were forcibly removed and sent for adoption, a practice which was encouraged by Rahman, who said, [...] "I do not want those polluted blood in this country". While many women were glad for the abortion programme, as {{they did not have to}} bear a child conceived of rape, others had to go full term, filled with hatred towards the child they carried. Others, who had their children adopted out so as to return to [...] "mainstream life", would not look at their newborn as it was taken from them. In the 1990s many of these children returned to Bangladesh to search for their birth mothers. In 2008, D'Costa attempted to find those who had been adopted, however very few responded, one who did said [...] "I hated being <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> <b>and</b> I am angry at Bangladesh for not taking care of me when I needed it most.
