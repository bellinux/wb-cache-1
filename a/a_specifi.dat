40|$|Abstract: Elderly {{patients}} presenting cardiovascular, respiratory, or {{neurological disorders}} require <b>a</b> <b>specifi</b> c dental care approach, especially patients presenting Alzheimer’s disease.

In many situations, routine sedative prescriptions for dental care, such as benzodiazepine or antihistaminics, are not recommended for these patients. Nitrous oxide inhalation together with <b>a</b> <b>specifi</b> c behavioral threshold is currently the only sedative procedure adapted to cognitively-impaired elderly patients.
