5|$|Diocletian was in Antioch in {{the autumn}} of 302, when the next {{instance}} of persecution occurred. The deacon Romanus visited a court while preliminary sacrifices were taking place and interrupted the ceremonies, denouncing the act in a loud voice. He was arrested and sentenced to be set aflame, but Diocletian overruled the decision, and decided that Romanus should have his tongue removed instead. Romanus would be executed on November 18, 303. The boldness of this Christian displeased Diocletian, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the city and made for Nicomedia to spend the winter, accompanied by Galerius.|$|E
5|$|Doe {{was born}} in Reading, Berkshire. As a youth player, he played as a forward for AFC Newbury and Newbury and District Schools {{alongside}} Theo Walcott, before the duo signed for Swindon Town. They played together for four years. He said in one season, that his partnership with Walcott consisted of them scoring about 150 goals. During a tournament in Cardiff, Doe was converted into a centre-back. Doe was with Swindon Town {{from the age of}} 10, until he was deemed surplus to requirements by manager Paul Sturrock, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> in July 2007.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{retirement}} from baseball, Cooley moved to Dallas {{and began to}} work as a salesman. In his final years, he battled alcoholism, which partially contributed to his death from heat stroke in Dallas on August 9, 1937.

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1861, Maeser left the Lyceum and was offered a {{position}} at the Union Academy, established by Brigham Young. This academy was intended for students above elementary grades. Young appointed Maeser head of the school in February 1861. Maeser {{was concerned about the}} school systems meeting the needs and interests of its students, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the Union Academy to teach in other schools and seminaries, including the Twentieth Ward Seminary, which he founded in 1862.

5|$|Kyle Vogt, {{who played}} Peter, told the {{production}} {{team at the}} outset of filming that he only had a limited amount of time to dedicate to the project.

5|$|Although Arsenal {{was founded}} in 1886, {{it was not until}} 1897 that the club {{appointed}} a permanent manager in charge of first-team affairs, with Thomas Mitchell universally recognised as Arsenal's first professional manager. Mitchell joined Arsenal five months after resigning from Blackburn Rovers in October 1896. The Scotsman's time at Woolwich Arsenal was brief <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> his post barely a year into his contract, though he did manage to take the club from tenth to fifth in the league. Mitchell guided Arsenal through a respectable cup run which culminated in the first round proper. William Elcoat succeeded Mitchell as manager in April 1898, and set about reviving the squad with new additions. The changes did not have the desired effect; his team finished seventh in a league of 18 and were beaten 6–0 by Derby County in the FA Cup first round. He departed in February 1899, and like his predecessor only remained for a season.|$|E

5|$|Del Piero {{began his}} rise to {{professional}} football in 1981, {{in the ranks}} of San Vendemiano. In 1988, Del Piero was first spotted by scouts, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> home at the young age of 13 to play with the youth side of Padova. He joined the senior side during the 1991–92 season, at the age of 16, and at the age of 17, he made his début in Serie B against Messina, under manager Mauro Sandreani, on 15 March 1992, coming on as a substitute for Roberto Putelli. The following season, on 22 November 1992, he scored his first professional goal in a 5–0 victory over Ternana. In 1993, thanks to Giampiero Boniperti, Del Piero was bought by Juventus for five billion lire, with an overlap of 150million lire per season.|$|E
5|$|Despite these setbacks, {{the revolt}} spread further. The Ionians sent {{men to the}} Hellespont and Propontis, and {{captured}} Byzantium and the other nearby cities. They also persuaded the Carians to join the rebellion. Furthermore, seeing {{the spread of the}} rebellion, the kingdoms of Cyprus also revolted against Persian rule without any outside persuasion. For the next three years, the Persian army and navy were fully occupied with fighting the rebellions in Caria and Cyprus, and Ionia seems to have had an uneasy peace during these years. At the height of the Persian counter-offensive, Aristagoras, sensing the untenability of his position, decided to abandon his position as leader of Miletus, and of the revolt, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> Miletus. Herodotus, who evidently has a rather negative view of him, suggests that Aristagoras simply lost his nerve and fled.|$|E
5|$|During September and October of the 1999–2000 season, Boulding {{scored in}} four {{successive}} league games. However, {{he could only}} score another two goals {{during the rest of}} the campaign to once again record a tally of six goals. His last goal came only two minutes after he had come on as a substitute during Mansfield's penultimate game of the season against Scunthorpe United, which helped the team to their fourth successive home victory and a final league position of 13th. Boulding's two-year contract with Mansfield had finished <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> after playing 74appearances in all competitions for Mansfield, of which 41 were as a substitute. During his two seasons he scored 12goals, all in the league.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the third Four Quartets poem, The Dry Salvages, Eliot's health declined and he stayed in Shamley Green, Surrey while he recovered. During this time, Eliot started writing Little Gidding. The first draft was completed in July 1941 but he was dissatisfied with it. He believed the problems with the poem lay with his own inability to write, and that, precipitated by air raids on London, he had started the poem with too little preparation and had written it too quickly. After the first draft was written, he set the poem aside, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> in September to lecture throughout Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|He became {{active in}} an armed {{struggle}} against the Ottoman government and Kurdish irregulars in the late 1880s. Andranik joined the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktustyun) party and, along with other fedayi (militias), sought to defend the Armenian peasantry living in their ancestral homeland, an area known as Western (or Turkish) Armeniaat the time part of the Ottoman Empire. His revolutionary activities ceased <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the Ottoman Empire after the unsuccessful uprising in Sasun in 1904. In 1907, Andranik left Dashnaktustyun because he disapproved of its cooperation with the Young Turks, a party which years later perpetrated the Armenian Genocide. Between 1912 and 1913, together with Garegin Nzhdeh, Andranik led a few hundred Armenian volunteers within the Bulgarian army against the Ottomans during the First Balkan War.|$|E
5|$|He was {{inducted}} into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975. Russell, who had a difficult relationship with the media, did not attend either event. After retiring as a player, Russell had stints as head coach of the Seattle SuperSonics (1973 to 1977) and Sacramento Kings (1987 to 1988). His time as a non-player coach was lackluster; although he led the struggling SuperSonics into the playoffs {{for the first time in}} franchise history, Russell's defensive, team-oriented Celtics mindset did not mesh well with the team, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> in 1977 with a 162–166 record. Russell's stint with the Kings was considerably shorter, his last assignment ending when the Kings went 17–41 to begin the 1987–88 season.|$|E
