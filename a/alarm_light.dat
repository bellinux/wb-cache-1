5000|$|... "Walk Test" [...] is {{a method}} of testing many fire alarm devices that saves time and {{requires}} fewer technicians at the location. Using [...] "Walk Test", a technician can simply walk around the building and initiate any device he/she would like. Doing so will send {{a signal to the}} panel, which will pulse the NAC a certain amount of times to indicate the zone on which the device is wired to. Silent Walktest will only flash the <b>alarm</b> <b>light</b> on the panel, thus not sounding the signals.|$|E
5000|$|In larger PBXs the {{attendant}} console {{may also be}} used to perform certain administrative tasks. Smaller systems may have all programming of the phone system done from {{the attendant}} console. As the attendant typically knows more about the phone system than other users, the attendant console may be used to alert users to a problem with the phone system. As an example should a Definity ECS PBX have a problem, such as a hardware failure, it may activate an <b>alarm</b> <b>light</b> on the console so the attendant can call for repair.|$|E

50|$|On {{the evening}} of Friday, February 1, 2002, Danielle van Dam's mother Brenda and two girlfriends went out to a bar, Dad's, in Poway. Danielle's father Damon stayed at home to look after Danielle and her two brothers. Damon put Danielle to bed around 10:30 p.m., and she fell asleep. Damon also slept until his wife {{returned}} home at around 2:00 a.m. with four of her friends. Brenda noticed a light on the home’s security alarm system was flashing, and discovered that the side door to the garage was open. The six chatted for approximately half an hour then Brenda's friends went home. Damon and Brenda went to sleep believing that their daughter was sleeping in her room. About an hour later, Damon awoke and noticed that an <b>alarm</b> <b>light</b> was flashing. He found {{the sliding glass door}} leading to the back yard open, so he closed it. The next morning, Danielle was missing. The couple frantically searched their home, but could not find her. They called the police at 9:39 a.m.|$|E

40|$|In this report, the {{magnitude}} of the problem of rear-end collisions is described. The report also draws up a test framework based on a theoretical approach and a judgement of various recent provisions for improving the rear light configuration. These provisions include: regulation of light intensity; rear fog lights; braking-dependant lights; early-warning brake lights; lights activated by emergency stopping; and solutions reducing the wearing out of lamps. The test framework makes it possible to judge inventions on their necessity, functioning, and optical features. Adjustments to the rear light configuration during the last decennia involved addition of a component (third brake light, rear fog light). In this, existing functions were improved so that a gradual introduction could be applied (only new cars). As an adjustment often has consequences for the whole rear light configuration, it is concluded that `Europe' was justly reserved. Once good arguments for introducing a new function or component (necessitating) are presented, the complete renewal of the rear light configuration can be considered. Matters such as integration, standardisation, and adaptive regulation then become relevant. Recommendations are made for further adjustments to the rear light configuration. These adjustments are also aimed at improving the present functions, so that retrofit is unnecessary. These are: making two rear fog lights mandatory; voluntary regulation of <b>light</b> intensity; voluntary <b>alarm</b> <b>lights</b> for emergency stops; and voluntary <b>alarm</b> <b>lights</b> after an emergency stop...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} an autocorrelation function-based program of dynamic image recognition and automatic <b>alarm.</b> <b>Lighting</b> effect analysis, binarization {{of the dynamic}} image and other methods were used to enhance the image; a dynamic image autocorrelation function was established to determine the threshold of automatic alarm system; and using Matlab software a simulation experiment {{was conducted on the}} autocorrelation function. The experiment showed that the correlation function value is inversely proportional to the amount of change of the video surveillance image; the autocorrelation function value can be used to determine when to trigger the automatic alarm system. This dynamic image recognition program, characterized by strong stability and little impact from the outside, can be used for automatic alarm of monitoring system...|$|R

40|$|Passive {{infrared}} sensors have {{widespread use}} in many applications, including motion detectors for <b>alarms,</b> <b>lighting</b> systems and hand dryers. Combinations of multiple PIR sensors {{have also been}} used to {{count the number of}} humans passing through doorways. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of the PIR sensor as a tool for occupancy estimation inside of a monitored environment. Our approach shows how flexible nonparametric machine learning algorithms extract useful information about the occupancy from a single PIR sensor. The approach allows us to understand and make use of the motion patterns generated by people within the monitored environment. The proposed counting system uses information about those patterns to provide an accurate estimate of room occupancy which can be updated every 30 seconds. The system was successfully tested on data from more than 50 real office meetings consisting of at most 14 room occupants...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} limited study {{to date on the}} {{environmental}} impacts of crime prevention measures. We address this shortfall by estimating the carbon footprint associated with the most widely used burglary prevention measures: door locks, window locks, burglar <b>alarms,</b> <b>lighting</b> and CCTV cameras. We compare these footprints with a measure of their effectiveness, the security protection factor, allowing us to identify those measures that are both low-carbon and effective in preventing burglary. Window locks are found to be the most effective and low-carbon measure available individually. Combinations of window locks, door locks, external and indoor lightings are also shown to be effective and low-carbon. Burglar alarms and CCTV do not perform as strongly, with low security against burglary and higher carbon footprints. This information can be used to help inform more sustainable choices of burglary prevention within households as well as for crime prevention product design...|$|R
40|$|The Mobile Integrated Temporary Utility System (MITUS) {{integrates}} portable {{electrical power}} along with communications and emergency <b>alarm</b> and <b>lighting</b> capabilities to provide safe, centralized power to work areas {{that need to}} be de-energized for decommissioning work. MITUS consists of a portable unit substation; up to twenty portable kiosks that house the power receptacles, communications, and emergency <b>alarm</b> and <b>lighting</b> systems; and a central communications unit. This system makes sequential decommissioning efforts efficient and cost-effective by allowing the integrated system to remain intact while being moved to subsequent work sites. Use of the MITUS also eliminates the need to conduct zero-energy tests and implement associated lock-out/tag-out procedures at partially de-energized facilities. Since the MITUS is a designed system, it can be customized to accommodate unique facility conditions simply by varying kiosks and transformer configurations. The MITUS is an attractive alternate to the use of portable generators with stand-alone communications and emergency system. It is more cost-effective than upgrading or reconfiguring existing power distribution systems...|$|R
