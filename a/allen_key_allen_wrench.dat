50|$|The FCS {{system was}} {{designed}} by Brian A. Whitty in Elanora, Australia, and patented on November 7, 1995. It can be recognized by the 2 tabs on the fins which are designed {{to fit into a}} securing plug that attaches the fin to the board. The fin tabs are placed in slots which are set into the board by the use of a plug that fits flush with the underside of the board. They are secured into these plugs by the use of set screws which can be tightened down by a fin <b>key</b> or <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench.</b> The plug design and use of set screws enables the fin to be easily removed and installed for storage or travel.|$|R
2500|$|The {{manual system}} uses a screw {{that has a}} {{standard}} hex head or square head and is driven using an <b>allen</b> <b>key</b> or <b>wrench.</b> A manual knockout punch can handle holes from [...] The ratchet system has a custom ratcheting wrench that uses a ball screw to make the process faster and easier. This type of system has a mechanical advantage of approximately 220:1 and can punch holes up to [...] in diameter in 10 gauge mild steel. A hydraulic system is much bulkier and heavier than the other systems {{but it is the}} easiest to use and can make holes up to [...] in diameter. It is a two piece system where the dies are attached to the ram which is connected to the hydraulic unit via a flexible hose.|$|R
50|$|The {{manual system}} uses a screw {{that has a}} {{standard}} hex head or square head and is driven using an <b>allen</b> <b>key</b> or <b>wrench.</b> A manual knockout punch can handle holes from 0.5 to 1.25 in. The ratchet system has a custom ratcheting wrench that uses a ball screw to make the process faster and easier. This type of system has a mechanical advantage of approximately 220:1 and can punch holes up to 3 in in diameter in 10 gauge mild steel. A hydraulic system is much bulkier and heavier than the other systems {{but it is the}} easiest to use and can make holes up to 6 in in diameter. It is a two piece system where the dies are attached to the ram which is connected to the hydraulic unit via a flexible hose.|$|R
5000|$|Threadless stems can {{be changed}} with a single <b>allen</b> <b>wrench.</b> (Some quill stems also use a single <b>allen</b> <b>wrench.)</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Band members: Tracey Birnie (Vocals), Steve Ward (Drums) Craig Becconsall (Bass) David Rudder (Guitar) Ken Wells (<b>keys),</b> Phil <b>Allen</b> (<b>Keys)</b> Nick Buchanan (Drums). Big Game Hunters {{opened the}} Palladium and played 3 years straight, 4 nights a week.|$|R
50|$|Hex (or <b>Allen)</b> <b>keys</b> {{are used}} on the various hex bolts on the stem, top cap and handlebars.|$|R
5000|$|The {{truss rod}} tension is usually {{controlled}} using an adjustment bolt (a hex nut or <b>allen</b> <b>key).</b> Depending {{on the model}} of guitar, this bolt can be located: ...|$|R
50|$|Unlike Meccano (up until recently), {{the screws}} {{did not use}} a regular screwdriver, but an <b>allen</b> <b>key.</b> Sometimes the {{manufacturing}} tolerances were poor, and the screws were hard to use.|$|R
5000|$|On newer Fender-style {{electric}} guitars [...] - [...] {{behind the}} nut, uncovered and {{can usually be}} adjusted by a 1/8" [...] (3 mm) <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some models {{exported}} to UK were fitted with Kahler Traditional Series tremolos, stamped [...] "Made in the USA", and supplied with the American Precision Metal Works, Inc. set-up instructions and <b>Allen</b> <b>keys.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Yamaha Finger Clamp is {{a variety}} of Floyd Rose that have {{built-in}} levers, and thus when tuning, no <b>allen</b> <b>keys</b> are needed. Available on the RGX520DZ, RGX620DZ and CV820 Wes Borland signature model.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a small}} <b>allen</b> <b>key</b> {{adjustment}} for the strength of heel twist to release, so beginners can have it 'soft' and easy to get out, and then tighten it up as they progress.|$|R
5000|$|Regular <b>allen</b> <b>wrenches</b> {{can be used}} {{to adjust}} {{threadless}} headset bearings. By comparison, large, and relatively expensive, wrenches are required to adjust threaded headset bearings; their size generally precludes carrying them on the road.|$|R
5000|$|On {{acoustic}} guitars [...] - [...] {{inside the}} guitar body, accessible through the sound hole, {{or on the}} headstock. Martins use a 3/16" [...] (5 mm) <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench</b> and Gibson uses {{the same as for}} the Gibson electrics above.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, {{the company}} marketed a knock down {{version of its}} Viking chair at their SoHo store, packing the pieces in a single easy-to-carry white gift box with an orange ribbon, {{requiring}} only {{the use of an}} included <b>allen</b> <b>wrench</b> to assemble the piece.|$|R
40|$|Less space {{needed for}} {{installation}} and removal. Nut {{for use with}} short bolts torqued with <b>allen</b> <b>wrench.</b> In contrast with standard hexagonal nuts, new nut requires no external wrench clearance on installation surface. Nut has many uses in assemblies where space is limited, especially in automotive and aircraft industries...|$|R
50|$|TurtleBot 1 {{consists}} of an iRobot Create base, a 3000 mAh battery pack, a TurtleBot power board with gyro, a Kinect sensor, an Asus 1215N laptop with a dual core processor, and a hardware mounting kit attaching everything together and adding future sensors. Assembling the kit is quick and easy using a single <b>allen</b> <b>wrench</b> (included in the kit).|$|R
30|$|Hex <b>wrenches</b> and <b>Allen</b> <b>keys</b> are {{available}} in the supplied instrument sets for mounting half pins in Rancho cubes. In our experience, they are associated with a risk of breakage at the head–driver interface, causing difficulties should the fixator assembly need to be dismantled. The third part of the experiment showed that higher torques can be applied safely when using bolts.|$|R
5000|$|Another type is a locking nut. This nut—usually used in {{conjunction}} with a locking vibrato system such as a Floyd Rose or Kahler—clamps the strings against the nut. This improves tuning stability when using the vibrato bar. A drawback however, is that the locking nut must be loosened using an <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench</b> to tune outside the range of the fine tuners on the bridge (if present).|$|R
5000|$|... "El Duce" [...] was {{mentioned}} in the underground hit Fist Fun by Dr. Know in 1986. He was also {{mentioned in the}} Anthrax song [...] "I'm the Man". There's also a song about him by Kill <b>Allen</b> <b>Wrench</b> called El Duce Will Kick Your Ass. Hoke briefly appears in a backstage segment of the Self Destruct Tour portion of the Nine Inch Nails video compilation Closure.|$|R
50|$|The Chinese paigu (排鼓; pinyin: páigǔ; also spelled pai gu) {{is a set}} {{of three}} to seven tuned drums (in most {{instances}} five are used), traditionally made of wood with animal skin heads. It is played by beating the heads (and sometimes also the body) with sticks. Most drums are double-sided and turnable. Both sides have different tunings. Tuning is done through the use of <b>Allen</b> <b>keys.</b>|$|R

Additionally TurtleBot 2 comes with a fast charging dock that TurtleBot can autonomously dock with, enabling continuous operation.|$|R
50|$|Starting on November 2, 2010, Roland Hedley began {{interviewing}} President Bush for Fox News. The {{interview was}} {{in anticipation of}} the release of Bush's memoir, Decision Points, which was due to be released on November 9. At that point, the asterisk remained but nearly all of the Roman helmet was gone. All that remained was the crest holder (sans crest) which was so badly battered that it resembled an all-in-one assembly of <b>Allen</b> <b>wrenches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Though El Duce {{claimed that}} he knew who killed Kurt, {{he did not mention}} a name and offered no {{evidence}} to support his assertion. However, he mentioned speaking to someone called [...] "Allen" [...] (<b>Allen</b> <b>Wrench),</b> before quickly interjecting, [...] "I mean, my friend", then laughing, [...] "I'll let the FBI catch him." [...] Broomfield incidentally captured El Duce's final interview, as he died days later when he was struck by a train {{in the middle of the}} night.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout its history, Moots {{has been}} known for the {{innovative}} bicycle components they design and manufacture. In the 1980s, Eriksen design the company's [...] "Moots Mounts," [...] clamp-on cantilever posts which could be removed or repositioned using only an <b>allen</b> <b>wrench.</b> [...] Another innovation was an early version of what became known as [...] "bar ends" [...] in the 1990s. The product made by Moots clamped inside the brake levers and had large wooden balls at the ends.|$|R
50|$|For basic {{maintenance}} and repairs cyclists can carry a pump (or a CO2 cartridge), a puncture repair kit, a spare inner tube, and tire levers {{and a set of}} <b>allen</b> <b>keys.</b> Cycling can be more efficient and comfortable with special shoes, gloves, and shorts. In wet weather, riding can be more tolerable with waterproof clothes, such as cape, jacket, trousers (pants) and overshoes and high-visibility clothing is advisable to reduce the risk from motor vehicle users.|$|R
50|$|Most {{electric}} fretted string instruments have individually adjustable bridge saddles, adjustable with a {{screw driver}} or <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench.</b> Acoustic fretted instruments typically have either a floating bridge, {{held in place}} by string tension, or a fixed bridge, such as a pin bridge on an acoustic guitar. A luthier or technician adjusts a floating bridge simply by carefully changing its position until the intonation is correct. Adjusting intonation on a fixed bridge involves carefully shaping the bridge saddle with a file to alter the string's contact point.|$|R
5000|$|Screw-in insert nuts have an {{external}} thread and hex head and are screwed {{in with a}} Flat Blade Screwdriver or an <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench.</b> The screw-in insert nuts come in various sizes and take different screw sizes. For example, a [...] "1/4-20" [...] insert nut will take a 1/4-20 inch bolt. The pre-drilled hole must be as deep as {{the length of the}} insert nut plus any portion of the bolt that may be screwed past the end of the nut in the work piece.|$|R
50|$|The PF-9 uses {{many parts}} {{originally}} designed for Kel-Tec’s P-11 and P-3AT models, {{and is a}} compromise between those pistols. From the P-11, the PF-9 uses a slightly modified barrel, trigger, ejector, and front sight. The P-3AT parts used in the PF-9 include the extractor and various springs. The grip is available {{in a variety of}} colors, while the slide is available in blued, Parkerized, ceramic (Cerakote), and hard chromed finishes. The PF-9 is shipped with an extended magazine floorplate, an <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench</b> for adjusting the rear sight, and an owner's manual.|$|R
50|$|Iron sights {{used for}} hunting guns {{tend to be}} a compromise. They will be adjustable, but only with tools—generally either a small {{screwdriver}} or an <b>allen</b> <b>wrench.</b> They will be compact and heavily built, and designed to lock securely into position. Target sights, on the other hand, are much bulkier and easier to adjust. They generally have large knobs to control horizontal and vertical movement without tools, and often they are designed to be quickly and easily detachable from the gun so they can be stored separately in their own protective case.|$|R
5000|$|The IKEA {{effect has}} been {{described}} as follows: [...] "The price is low for IKEA products largely because they take labor out of the equation. With a Phillips screwdriver, an <b>Allen</b> <b>wrench</b> and rubber mallet, IKEA customers can very literally build an entire home's worth of furniture on a very tight budget. But what happens when they do?" [...] They [...] "fall in love with their IKEA creations. Even when there are parts missing and the items are incorrectly built, customers in the IKEA study still loved the fruits of their labors." ...|$|R
50|$|Another type of tremolo is the locking tremolo. These bridges {{have a sort}} of vise in each saddle which clamps {{the string}} into place (usually with an <b>Allen</b> <b>key).</b> The end of the string has a clamp, which holds the string in place, {{stopping}} it from slipping. It is especially useful for songs that require tapping or heavy/hard playing styles. Once set up for tuning stability, locking tremolos are very good. However, their fulcrum points offer extremely minute contact with the body, which may disturb sound transfer.|$|R
50|$|Adjustable Wheel Base on 12 mm Thru-Axle. This axle setup {{features}} on the DHExtreme-8, Europa DS (12 mm version), Europa FS, and Triton DH. The Wheelbase can be adjusted horizontally by 1 inch to effect {{the handling of the}} bike. The axle is tightened with a 9 m <b>allen</b> <b>key</b> and memory locked with two smaller horizontal allen bolts, creating a very stiff wheelbase. The disk-brake mount and derrailleur hanger make up either side of the moving section, and can therefore be replaced if damaged.|$|R
