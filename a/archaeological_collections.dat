They are currently in the National Archives of the United Kingdom, having previously formed part of the Public Record Office. The letters were published in Sussex <b>Archaeological</b> <b>Collections</b> volume 3 in 1850 and were edited by William Henry Blaauw.

2500|$|Since the 1970s, provincial {{legislation}} in Ontario has mandated that lands projected for development {{must first be}} assessed for evidence of cultural heritage, including archaeological sites. As a result, the number of archaeological sites identified and excavated in the province, {{and the amount of}} data and collections amassed, has grown steadily over the past several decades. Today, 80-90% of archaeological practice in Ontario is conducted as commercial-based fieldwork, undertaken on behalf of the public and private sector by cultural resource management (CRM) companies. The collection of archaeological artifacts from licensed excavations has exceeded storage capabilities in Ontario. Collections have remained largely inaccessible to researchers, students, and local and Descendant communities. This [...] "crisis" [...] in curation reflects broader trends in the management of <b>archaeological</b> <b>collections</b> internationally.|$|E

The work to expand the museum (which began in 2009) was completed in December 2013. The new layout of the museum consists of 35 rooms, spread over five floors: On the ground floor are <b>archaeological</b> <b>collections</b> which are continued on the fifth and fourth floors, then going back in time, down to the lower levels.

2500|$|Many {{churches in}} small villages around the South Downs were changed very little {{after they were}} built, and St Botolph's Church {{is an example of}} this. Minimal {{population}} growth over the centuries meant that enlargement was not needed; and the parishes tended to be poor, with little to spend on rebuilding or new architectural designs. [...] Therefore, the church retained its simple appearance until the 19th century, when a porch and bell-turret were added. At the same time, the frescoes were revealed again: first in 1862, when a section of whitewash was removed and one painting was found (although the work damaged it), and later in 1866, when the rest were uncovered. They are faded but clearly discernible. [...] Philip Mainwaring Johnston undertook some restoration of the frescoes around 1900 and wrote a study of them in the Sussex <b>Archaeological</b> <b>Collections</b> in 1901.|$|E

He began his degree in 1927, and during {{his first two years}} was enrolled on the history tripos. He attended lectures by economic historians like Michael Postan, which would influence his later archaeological approach to the economies of prehistoric societies. During these years he had continued his research into archaeology on an independent basis, producing articles on prehistoric stone tools that were published in the journals Sussex <b>Archaeological</b> <b>Collections</b> and the Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society of East Anglia.|$|E
