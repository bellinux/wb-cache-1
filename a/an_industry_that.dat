5|$|At {{the end of}} the 17th century {{large numbers}} of Huguenot weavers arrived in the East End, {{settling}} to service <b>an</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> grew up around the new estate at Spitalfields, where master weavers were based. They brought with them a tradition of 'reading clubs', where books were read, often in public houses. The authorities were suspicious of immigrants meeting and in some ways they were right to be as these grew into workers' associations and political organisations. Towards the middle of the 18th century the silk industry fell into a decline – partly due to the introduction of printed calico cloth – and riots ensued. These 'Spitalfield Riots' of 1769 were actually centred to the east and were put down with considerable force, culminating in two men being hanged in front of the Salmon and Ball public house at Bethnal Green. One was John Doyle (an Irish weaver), the other John Valline (of Huguenot descent).|$|E

25|$|From 1919 {{until the}} Repeal of Prohibition in 1933, many Italian-Americans {{struggled}} to keep their vineyards going.

25|$|P. M. Barber was {{the first}} person to come to Montgomery and {{establish}} <b>an</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> achieved any sustainable success. He opened a distillery in 1859 and later a planing mill in 1869 on the site of the distillery. Barber, along with his partners, A.B. Henderson, Jesse Rank, and Nathan Fowler, had so much success that they laid out a town around their mill in 1870. The town was further expanded by the success of Montgomery Machine Shops, which, starting in 1873 under the supervision of Levi Houston, built woodworking machinery that was sold to clients throughout the United States and Canada and as far away as Australia.|$|E
25|$|The comptometer, {{introduced}} in 1887, {{was the first}} machine to use a keyboard which consisted of columns of nine keys (from 1 to 9) for each digit. The Dalton adding machine, manufactured from 1902, {{was the first to}} have a 10 key keyboard. Electric motors were used on some mechanical calculators from 1901. In 1961, a comptometer type machine, the Anita mk7 from Sumlock comptometer Ltd., became the first desktop mechanical calculator to receive an all electronic calculator engine, creating the link in between these two industries and marking the beginning of its decline. The production of mechanical calculators came to a stop {{in the middle of the}} 1970s closing <b>an</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> had lasted for 120 years.|$|E
25|$|The rule {{of strict}} {{liability}} famously {{laid down by}} Blackburn J., in Rylands v. Fletcher, proved to be rather ineffective {{with the passage of}} time to counter the dangerous use of one’s property or <b>an</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> produced substances or wastes detrimental to public health. The pre-requirements essential for establishing a liability under the principle of strict liability viz., the non-natural use of land, use of a dangerous thing, and the element of escape provided substantial loopholes to the enterprises to escape liability under the Rylands v. Fletcher rule. Moreover, the exceptions provided within the rule (and restated by the Supreme Court of India in MC Mehta v. Union of India) afford ample opportunity to the commercial enterprises to escape liability.|$|E

25|$|A {{review of}} colonial defences in the 1870s saw a {{complete}} {{overhaul of the}} coastal defences of Hobart, and a new fortress called Kangaroo Battery was constructed between 1880 and 1888 just {{to the south of}} Bellerive. <b>An</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> flourished throughout Clarence Plains was fruit growing, and by the 1880s several prosperous orchards were located within the region. A rare attempt at commercial opportunism was the short-lived Bellerive-Sorell Railway (1892 until 1926) which had its terminus on a long jetty extending into the Bay on reclaimed land that now makes up part of the Bellerive Boardwalk. It was hoped that is could eventually be connected to the Tasmanian Main Line at Brighton, thus providing rail access to the south of Clarence Plains, Sorrell and the Tasman Peninsular, but engineering difficulties and economic problems led to its abandonment.|$|E

Yorath paid tribute to Rollason shortly after her death, saying she would be [...] "an icon for young girls {{who want to go}} into that field because she showed what could be done.

500|$|In a 2010 {{article for}} PopMatters, music writer Tyler Lewis said that neo soul has been {{received}} with much controversy: [...] "Given the way black {{music has been}} named by (usually) outsiders ever since the blues, {{the reaction to the}} name by artists who ostensibly fit into the 'neo-soul' category represents a wonderful example of black self-determination in <b>an</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> is still defiantly wedded to narrow definitions and images of black folks." [...] Jason Anderson of CBC News compares the etymology of neo soul to that of [...] "new wave" [...] and comments: [...] "As imperfect as the term may be, neo-soul is still an effective tag to describe the mix of chic modernity and time-honoured tradition that distinguished the genre's best examples.

500|$|During Greenfield's premiership, Alberta's major {{non-agricultural}} {{industry was}} coal mining, {{and the industry}} was not prospering. [...] Production was more than 50% greater than demand, and {{fewer than half of}} the province's mines were profitable. [...] The industry as a whole was earning a profit of less than one cent per ton of coal. [...] Miners' wages had more than doubled (in nominal terms) between 1909 and 1920 but had barely held their own against the wartime inflation. In the 1920s mine owners began to roll them back. [...] Besides the low wages, miners were unsatisfied with working conditions in <b>an</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> saw more than 3,300 workplace accidents per year. [...] The results had been labour militancy and violence. [...] A general strike in the industry in 1920 had seen strikers assault strikebreakers, throw them off their bicycles, and throw rocks through the windows of buses. [...] Police were used to aid the strikebreakers and had been sometimes attacked as well. One constable was partially paralyzed from the beating he received. [...] Provincial police commissioner W.C. Bryan was warned against inspecting one strike site in a note reading [...] "You spoilt the strike, and if you go...you will be killed."
