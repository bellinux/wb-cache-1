5|$|Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) {{is shown}} as <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{irreversible}} protease inhibitor {{in the figure}} above right. The enzyme hydrolyses the phosphorus–fluorine bond, but the phosphate residue remains bound to the serine in the active site, deactivating it. Similarly, DFP also reacts with the active site of acetylcholine esterase in the synapses of neurons, and consequently is a potent neurotoxin, with a lethal dose of less than 100mg.|$|E

Dr. Netz calculates that the pieces can be made into a square 17,152 ways. The number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation and reflection have been excluded.
