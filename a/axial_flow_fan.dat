50|$|A small <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> was {{constructed}} {{in the base of}} each silo. This was attached to perforated ducting, which sat {{on the floor of the}} silo. When in operation, the fan blew cool dry air, which was distributed via the ducting throughout the bin. This reduced the temperature of the maize within the structure to a level at which insect and mould development could not occur. A combination of drying and cooling using this method enabled the maize to be maintained in a sound and fresh condition for long periods. Cleaning equipment was located at each silo complex, while a drying plant was established at the Atherton silos to process maize with a moisture content exceeding 14 percent.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The present CFD {{analysis}} {{is aimed at}} studying the effect of tip injection on the performance and flow characteristics in the tip region of an <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> under distorted inflow condition. Inlet flow distortions are flow non-uniformities that cause a reduction in performance and operating flow ranges of <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fan.</b> CFD simulations were carried out for the following configurations: (a) 90 o circumferential extent steady total pressure distortion without tip injection and (b) 90 o circumferential extent steady total pressure distortion with tip injection. The configuration with six injectors, injector velocity of 60 m/s, 0 ° pitch angle, and injector skew angle of- 15 ° (in an orientation opp. osing the direction of rotor rotation) is used for tip injection study. Total pressure values have been noted down from Ansys CFX post at the exit of the axial fan, both in distorted and uniform regions (with and without tip injection case). The simulation results are analyzed to obtain axial fan performance parameters like the pressure rise coefficient, flow coefficient. The result of the present analysis shows that the tip injection increases the pressure rise by 4. 04 % in distorted inflow for pitch angle of 0 o and skew angle of- 15 o.

40|$|<b>Axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fans</b> {{are often}} the largest {{contributor}} to the noise emitted from commercial refrigerator systems. This has driven the demand for quieter, yet higher performance <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fans.</b> Turbulent fluid motion and aerodynamic forces interacting with the fan blades generate noise as the fan rotates. The aerodynamic noise emitted from a fan can be modelled {{with varying degrees of}} accuracy which are typically proportional to the computational cost. Application of a fan performance model to an optimisation algorithm can be used to develop new and higher performing fan blades. However, there is currently no rapid method to generate an optimal fan design of specified performance. The method developed in this project was experimentally validated and shown to be able to predict the flow rate accurately; however, the fan noise prediction was unsuccessful. Noise source identification showed that the dominant fan noise source was incident turbulence noise which was neglected in the aeroacoustic modelling and explains the poor noise prediction. Knowing the dominant noise source allows for future modelling to include all relevant physics which will allow for more accurate modelling that will increase the performance of <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fans</b> and reduce refrigeration noise. This study also showed that fans with aerofoil blade shapes have superior performance to fans with cambered plate blades, which are commonly used in commercial refrigerators. ii...|$|R

In the paper, the performance of the contra-rotating <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> is experimentally investigated. The study is focused on the fan performance, the shaft power and the match between the motor and fan efficiency at different blade angles. The results show that the blade angle 43 °/ 26 ° has the best aerodynamic performance. The first engine has a greater impact on the fan than the second one. The blade angle with the best aerodynamic performance does not necessarily correspond to the one with the best match between the motor and fan efficiency.

40|$|This work aims {{to study}} and analyze the {{behavior}} of flow in <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fan.</b> Numerical simulations were carried out based on Navier-stocke equations coupled with k – ε Turbulence model with standard wall function. These simulations were applied to <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> which consists of nine rotor blades and fifteen stator blades. These blades were designed by modified quasi-three dimensional design program code. In the present work, different flow phenomena which occur in <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> were presented and interpreted at different regions with special concern to the rotor exit and stator regions. In order to study the behavior and mechanism of these phenomena, different flow parameters (velocity components, pressure and turbulent intensity) were calculated at different regions and at different flow rate coefficients. It is found that high flow rate causes higher vortex flow than low flow rate, mainly due to existence of the adverse pressure and hence a reverse flow at high flow rate. This is clearly observed in the stator region which negatively affected by increasing the flow rate and the stator became inefficient. It has been also found that, high flow rate causes a vortex flow at stator pressure side while the lower flow rate causes a vortex flow at stator suction side. This study shows that decrease in flow rate causes wider range of wake and vortex at the rotor exit than that caused by the other cases of flow rate. Finally in order to validate the present simulation, the obtained results were compared with the available literature results and {{it was found that}} their physical behavior agree quite well...|$|E

The effect of injection applied have been studied (i) during recovery only, and (ii) during the entire period from unstalled flow to the end of recovery (hysteresis).

40|$|Abstract: This work aims {{to study}} and analyze the {{behavior}} of flow in an <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> using numerical simulation based on solving Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations coupled with a modified Spalart-Allaras turbulence model. In the present work, different flow phenomena occuring in an <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> were presented and interpreted at different design conditions and at different regions, with special concern to the rotor exit and stator regions. Large vortices and reverse flow at the stator suction side were observed under high loading conditions. These are mainly due to radial and centrifugal effects in the fluid due to a decreasing flow rate. To avoid this type of flow, the stator flow pattern has been modified using a new stator blade. This blade was designed by changing the stator stagger angle by 10 ̊ in the radial direction. This study indicates that the flow in the modified stator region behaves well and gives better performance than that obtained when using a baseline stator, especially under high loading conditions. This study also indicates that the stator stagger angle has {{a significant effect on}} modifying the fan performance...|$|E

The use of such closure was here considered as a remedial strategy in LES of high-Reynolds industrial flows, being able to tackle the otherwise insufficient resolution of turbulence spectrum.

The spectral decomposition method applied to the measured SPL spectra has been used to obtain the propagation function which has been compared with the scaled SPL at the blade passage harmonics.

25|$|An {{axial fan}} {{is a type}} of a {{compressor}} that increases the pressure of the air flowing through it. The blades of the <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fans</b> force air to move parallel to the shaft about which the blades rotate.
