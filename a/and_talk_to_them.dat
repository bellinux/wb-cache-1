5|$|Jack Donaghy, who is Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric, {{makes an}} {{appearance}} on the fictional CNBC show The Hot Box. During the appearance, Jack interacts with the show's host, Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks), with the two flirting during the broadcast. Avery and Jack share Republican viewpoints, and she asks him out for a drink after the show, which he accepts. They eventually embark {{on a number of}} both successful and unsuccessful dates. During one of those dates, Jack invites her to a TGS VIP party he has hastily staged, whereupon he enlists the help of Jon Bon Jovi—at the time NBC's real-life Artist in Residence—to come over <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> in an effort to impress the successful Avery. When Bon Jovi approaches them, though, Jack disregards him due to his own intriguing conversation with Avery, which impresses her even more. After the TGS party, the two go back to Jack's apartment and end up sleeping together.|$|E
25|$|He {{developed}} a reputation as being very friendly with children. He carried candy in his pockets for the street urchins in Mantua and Venice, and taught catechism to them. During papal audiences, he would gather children around him <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> about things that interested them. His weekly catechism lessons {{in the courtyard of}} San Damaso in the Vatican always included a special place for children, and his decision to require the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine in every parish was partly motivated by a desire to reclaim children from religious ignorance.|$|E
500|$|Obviously we knew {{people were}} going to totally sensationalize it. They're {{beautiful}} girls, the scene is hot—I'm not afraid to say that. There is a sexual energy between the girls which is kind of authentic, because I know when I was a teen-aged girl, the friendships that I had with other girls were almost romantic, they were so intense. I wanted to sleep at my friend's house every night, I wanted to wear her clothes, we would talk on the phone until our ears ached. I wanted to capture that heightened feeling you get as an adolescent that you don't really feel as a grownup. (laughs) You like [...] friends when you're a grownup, but you don't need to sleep in the same bed with them <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> on the phone until 5 a.m. every night.|$|E
60|$|I {{gathered}} <b>them</b> all in <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> all <b>and</b> severally, the payment, a merely nominal matter, being made, pro forma, in advance.|$|R

60|$|The {{fisherman}} {{became interested}} in the boys, and had Chet tell more about his missing parent. Then he went in search of some men who had business dealings with Tom Fetjen, <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> in Danish.|$|R
2500|$|Turkle also {{discusses}} {{the way our}} human identity is changing due to the fading boundary between humans and computers, and how people now have trouble distinguishing between humans and machines. [...] It used to be thought that humans were nothing like machines, because humans had feelings and machines did not. [...] However, as technology has improved, computers have {{become more and more}} human-like, and these boundaries had to be redrawn. [...] People now compare their own minds to machines, <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> freely without any shame or embarrassment. [...] Turkle questions our ethics in defining and differentiating between real life and simulated life.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2011, Minneapolis based {{record label}} Doomtree {{released}} {{an album of}} mash-ups between Fugazi and east coast veteran rap crew the Wu-Tang Clan. The album is titled 13 Chambers, group name Wugazi. However, Fugazi itself {{did not have any}} involvement with the release. Bassist Joe Lally was asked about his thoughts on the Wugazi release, and stated [...] "I think they could've found better Fugazi pieces to sample with Wu-Tang guys rapping on it. I mean, it’s enjoyable, and I do appreciate it for the fact that somebody enjoys our music enough to bring it into that. But, you know, I don’t know. I guess I should shut up, because I suppose I'm about to run into these people at the Fun Fun Fun Fest festival <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> But I’m afraid that is my opinion on it. It's like, get better samples of our stuff, do better work." ...|$|E
2500|$|... – In a {{press release}} from his office, Prime Minister Gordon Brown {{condemned}} the attacks in saying: [...] "I think I speak {{for the whole world}} – shock and outrage at the tragic destruction of innocent lives. I have already sent my sympathy and support to Prime Minister Singh of India and to say we will {{do everything we can to}} help the Indian government. Our first duty is towards British citizens caught up in this terror in Mumbai. The High Commissioner has come from Delhi to visit all those who are injured – he's visiting them now. It is too early to say any numbers for the numbers of people who are injured – we will give that during the course of the day – what I can assure you is we are doing everything within our power. We've set up a crisis centre in the foreign office where British citizens can phone in, just visit it <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> – they've had 800 calls already. And at the same time, we're in touch with many people who are caught up in the hotels and giving advice on what they can do. Our second responsibility is obviously to root out terrorism – to help the Indian government with their action – and that's why at the same time as giving support to the Indian prime minister, we're sending police emergency teams that are well versed in Indian terrorism and we will try to give what support we can through British police and security officials to the Indian government at this time". Foreign Secretary David Miliband also condemned the attacks, characterising them as [...] "an attack on all of us, not just India".|$|E

50|$|On another {{occasion}} Krishna, Balarama and Uddhava sent Akura to Hastinapura to gather news about Kunti and the Pandavas. Akura met Vasudev's sister Kunti {{and the king}} of Hastinapura, Dhritarashtra, <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> after which he returned to Dvaraka (Dashama Skandha, Bhagvata).|$|R
60|$|She {{went back}} <b>to</b> her friends <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> {{for a moment}} or two. Tavernake could hear Grier's protesting voice and Beatrice's light laugh. Evidently they were trying uselessly to persuade her to change her mind. Soon she came back to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jack, you {{had better}} be the {{spokesman}} for the crowd," [...] remarked Randy. [...] "You go ahead <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> and we'll stand back with our guns." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am here {{to speak}} to your people," [...] he said, [...] "and I will do so, if I have to stop in these lanes <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> one by one. You will pardon my {{reminding}} you, madam, that the days of feudalism are over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe you're {{thinking}} me a heartless flirt," [...] she protested. [...] "But I don't {{care if you}} are. I don't {{care what}} any one thinks of me. Just because one's interested and likes {{to be friends with}} men, <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as one talks to women, one's called a flirt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, haven't I, though?" [...] said Sir Hugo, provokingly. [...] "You {{are always}} looking tenderly at the women, <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> in a Jesuitical way. You are a {{dangerous}} young fellow--a kind of Lovelace who will make the Clarissas run after you instead of you running after them." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Kearney {{brought her}} {{daughter}} over <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> amiably. She {{wanted to be}} on good terms with them but, while she strove to be polite, her eyes followed Mr. Holohan in his limping and devious courses. As soon as she could she excused herself and went out after him.|$|R
30|$|In this course, when I first {{agreed to}} teach it, I went to who had taught the course before <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> about {{what should be}} in the course and what text was used. What they did was give me the word files with their course notes and I went through them and {{fine-tuned}} them.|$|R
6000|$|... "He may {{speak to}} you," [...] Saton continued. [...] "He takes curious fancies {{sometimes}} {{to address a}} perfect stranger, <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> intimately. Remember that though he lives in Switzerland, and has a German name, he is really an Englishman. Nothing annoys him more than to be spoken to in any other language." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was half}} an hour later when his {{companion}} rose. [...] "The time is slipping by," [...] she said. [...] "There is to be some singing, and {{one or two of the}} people we have met lately are coming round to-night. I must go in <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> These things are in a way one's duty. One has to do one's part." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{large and}} wealthy houses {{there was also}} a women's room, with a {{fireplace}} built low down in the middle, as in the hall, where the women used to sit with their handiwork all day.

60|$|They stood aside. A native {{opened a}} door for her and closed it behind her. They sat down and waited. One or two white men came <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> in undertones. Dr Macphail told them again what he knew of the tragedy. At last the door was quietly opened and Mrs Davidson came out. Silence fell upon them.|$|R
60|$|He did enter Doctor Hadley's office, {{although}} no sufferer from pyorrhea or appendicitis awaited him. Instead, {{he used the}} telephone for two calls: one {{to the president of}} the board of health; the other to the chief of police. Fortunately, he caught both at their offices, addressing them familiarly by their first names <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> most emphatically <b>and</b> confidentially.|$|R

60|$|We have {{to break}} away, back to the great unison of manhood in some passionate purpose. Now {{this is not like}} sex. Sex is always individual. A man has his own sex: nobody else's. And sexually he goes as a single individual; he can mingle only singly. So that to make sex a general affair is just a {{perversion}} and a lie. You can't get people <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> about their sex, {{as if it were a}} common interest.|$|E
6000|$|But {{though not}} soft or tender with his {{children}} he was very fond of them, {{and when he came}} home early in the evening he would get them round him <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> and sing old songs and ballads he had learnt in his young years--"Down in the Village," [...] "The Days of Queen Elizabeth," [...] "The Blacksmith," [...] "The Gown of Green," [...] "The Dawning of the Day," [...] and many others, which Caleb in the end got by heart and used to sing, too, when he was grown up.|$|E

50|$|Crown Heights Shomrim {{was founded}} in 1977. It {{expanded}} its operations following the 1991 Crown Heights riots. Members, driving repainted police cars, respond to armed robberies, burglaries, and assaults in progress, as well as automobile accidents and general assistance to residents.

50|$|Although {{early in}} the novel Dracula dons a mask of cordiality, he often flies into fits of rage when his plans are frustrated. When the three vampire women who live in his castle attempt to seduce Jonathan Harker, Dracula {{physically}} assaults one and ferociously berates them for their insubordination. He then relents <b>and</b> <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> more kindly, telling them that he does indeed love each of them.|$|R
6000|$|Kennicott telephoned that he {{was going}} into the country. Bjornstam had not {{finished}} his work at noon, and she invited him to have dinner with Bea in the kitchen. She wished that she were independent enough to dine with these her guests. She considered their friendliness, she sneered at [...] "social distinctions," [...] she raged at her own taboos--and she continued to regard them as retainers and herself as a lady. She sat in the dining-room and listened through the door to Bjornstam's booming and Bea's giggles. She was the more absurd to herself in that, after the rite of dining alone, she could go out to the kitchen, lean against the sink, <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

I do not know how strong their place is, but {{certainly}} Cossar will have made it strong. Before all this--before you came to me, I remember now--there was trouble brewing. There was an election--when all the little people settle things, by counting heads. It must be over now. There were threats against all our race--against all our race, that is, but you. I must see our Brothers. I must tell them all that has happened between us, and all that threatens now." ...|$|E

Built into the wall--and a little balcony. And there she will go and look out, when the mood takes her, and all round the city {{there will be a}} broad road and seats and great shady trees. And men will stroll up and down there when they feel the need of feminine company; when, for instance, they want to talk about their souls or their characters or any of the things that only women will stand....
