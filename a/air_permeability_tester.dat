40|$|The study {{evaluates the}} {{simultaneous}} use of aerogel and phase change material (PCM) {{on the face}} cloth of thermal liner in firefighter&# 039;s protective garment. Aerogel is commonly used to resist incoming heat flux {{in the field of}} high heat protection and to prevent the loss of body heat in the cold environment clothing. In high heat protection clothing, aerogel not only resists the incoming heat fluxes but also blocks the outbound body heat. As a result the wearer suffers from internal increase of body temperature. Previous studies identified the potential use of aerogel in firefighter&# 039;s protective clothing. However there was no clear approach to resolve the problem associated with body heat release. Current study focuses on the problem by applying PCM along with aerogel on fabric. The ambient-side of a thermal liner face cloth was coated with silica aerogel particles; meanwhile, the next to skin side was coated with PCM/aerogel composite powder. The new thermal liner revealed superior thermal protection and comfort. It extended the time to reach pain threshold and increased the pain alarm time. The Fourier transform infrared analysis of the aerogel/PCM composite powder showed the presence of PCM in nanoporous aerogel particles while the differential scanning calorimeter quantified the heat absorbing capacity of the new composite powder.

40|$|In this study, <b>air</b> <b>permeability</b> of {{woven fabrics}} is {{predicted}} from {{the parameters of}} weave structures. <b>Air</b> <b>permeability</b> is an important property of fabrics and has a decisive influence on the utilisation of fabric for some technical and clothing applications. There {{is no doubt that}} predetermination of the <b>air</b> <b>permeability</b> in woven fabric is vital, and modelling the ef-fective parameters shows the role of the factors as well as the prediction of the property. To promote the design of woven fabrics, we can define the crossing over firmness factor (CFF) and floating yarn factor (FYF) as the parameters of the weave structures for predicting <b>air</b> <b>permeability</b> values. All the parameters are related to <b>air</b> <b>permeability.</b> Multiple regression equations of <b>air</b> <b>permeability</b> are derived from those parameters of weave structures and the values predicted almost exactly agree with the values measured from the FAST system. Key words: <b>air</b> <b>permeability,</b> weave structure, woven fabric. Undoubtedly, predetermination of the <b>air</b> <b>permeability</b> in woven fabric is vital, and modelling the effective parameters shows the role of the factors as well as the pre-diction of the property. Therefore, many efforts have been made to model wo-ven fabric <b>air</b> <b>permeability.</b> The primary model to analyse fabric <b>air</b> <b>permeability</b> is given by Robertson [8]. He considered a wire mesh as a simplified model of a fabric and each pore space between the cross-over of the warp and weft to be a nozzle with an equal discharge coeffi-cient. His work was continued by Hoern-er [9], who used wire mesh for his model too, assumed that the wire mesh and a screen fabric both behave similarly under the same conditions and argues that the pressure drop is due to friction between the air and contact surface area of the me-dium, {{as well as to the}} speed of flow. Ac-tually he believed that the airflow through a fabric is similar to that through a tube, but with the effect of a greater aspect ra-tio. As a result his model was simple but not accurate enough.
