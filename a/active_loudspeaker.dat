40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method for automatically selecting the optimal in-situ acoustical frequency response of <b>active</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> within a discrete-valued set of responses offered by room response controls on <b>active</b> <b>loudspeakers.</b> The rationale {{of the room}} response controls for the <b>active</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> is explained. The frequency response, calculated from the acquired impulse response, is used as the input for the optimisation algorithm to select the most favourable combination of room response controls. The optimisation algorithm is described. The perform-ance of the algorithm is analysed and discussed. This algorithm has been implemented and is currently in active use by specialist loudspeaker system calibrators who set up and tune studios and listening rooms...|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "active speakers" [...] {{can also}} refer to an {{integrated}} [...] "active system" [...] in which passive loudspeakers are mated to an external system of multiple amplifiers fed by an active crossover.

5000|$|A speaker {{enclosure}} using a passive radiator (PR) usually contains an [...] "active loudspeaker" [...] (or main driver), and a passive radiator (also {{known as a}} [...] "drone cone").

5000|$|In a {{loudspeaker}} system incorporating passive diaphragms, the term 'active driver' {{refers to the}} loudspeaker driver with the voice coil, to distinguish it from the 'passive' diaphragms which have no voice coil. In loudspeaker systems that rely on resonant augmentation of {{the output of the}} active driver (these include bass-reflex systems, passive radiator systems, bandpass systems, and transmission-line systems), the resonant system absorbs the acoustic load from the <b>active</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> driver, decreasing the necessary cone excursion to achieve high output at low frequencies. However, it is advantageous to have {{a loudspeaker}} driver with a strong magnetic structure for high electrical damping of the driver cone. This supplies the maximum possible force to the loudspeaker cone and creates the maximum possible excitation of the resonant system.|$|E
50|$|A powered speaker usually weighs {{more than}} an {{equivalent}} passive speaker because the internal amplifier circuitry usually outweighs a speaker-level passive crossover. A loudspeaker associated with an integrated active system is even lighter because it has no internal crossover. A lightweight loudspeaker can be more easily carried and it {{is less of a}} load in rigging (flying). However, active speakers using lightweight Class-D amplifiers have narrowed the difference. Trucking for a sound system involves transporting all of the various components including amplifier racks, speaker cabling and loudspeaker enclosures. Overall shipping weight for an <b>active</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> system may be less than for a passive system because heavy passive speaker cable bundles are replaced by lighter AC cables and small diameter signal cables. Truck space and weight is reduced by eliminating amplifier racks.|$|E
50|$|A {{conventional}} loudspeaker is an {{electromechanical transducer}} that converts an electrical signal into sound. If locally powered, this {{can also be}} termed an <b>active</b> <b>loudspeaker,</b> meaning it contains an audio amplifier that can drive power to the speaker drivers. A network speaker implies the ability to drive audio to such a device from a network connection, usually over an Ethernet network or the Internet. In many cases this type of speaker also contains digital signal processing (DSP) to provide the audio crossover and other signal processing to provide frequency division and other tonal functions that exist in conventional speakers. Network speakers are also known as IP speakers. In many cases the IP speaker is created from an IP audio endpoint — a device as described above with the requisite network connection and ability to process audio packets, but without the actual physical speaker portion — that provides amplified audio to a conventional loudspeaker or unamplified audio (i.e. line-out) to an amplified speaker or system.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first years}} of the 21st century {{presented}} challenges. Genelec introduced the LSE-series of subwoofers and replaced most of the 2-way series with the new 8000 Series.

30|$|The {{recorded}} microphone {{signals are}} {{transformed into the}} frequency domain using the method presented by Chung [21]. This method rejects uncorrelated noise, e.g., turbulent flow noise, from the coherent sound pressure signals. Therefore, the sound pressure spectrum of one microphone is determined by calculating the cross-spectral densities between three signals, where one signal serves as a phase reference. In our case the phase reference signal is the source signal of the <b>active</b> <b>loudspeaker.</b> As a result we obtain a phase-correlated complex sound pressure spectrum for each microphone signal.|$|E

40|$|The {{perceived}} spatial {{spread of}} amplitude panned virtual sources {{is dependent on}} the number of loudspeakers that are used to produce them. When pair-wise or triplet-wise panning is applied, the number of <b>active</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> varies {{as a function of the}} panning direction. This may cause unwanted changes in spatial spread and coloration of a virtual source if it is moved in the sound stage. In this paper a method is presented to make the directional spread of amplitude panned virtual sources independent of their panning direction. This is accomplished by panning the sound signal to multiple directions near each other simultaneously. This forms a single virtual source with constant directional spread as a function of direction. 1...|$|R
