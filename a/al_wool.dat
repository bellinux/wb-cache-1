40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 To {{study the}} {{increase}} in the thermal conductivity of polymers embedded with conductive fillers, two fillers, BN particles and A 1 wool fibers, are blended with two different polymers in various volume percentage fractions. As such, the effect of filler type and volume fraction is observed on the thermal conductivity enhancement of the polymer composite. The thermal conductivity is shown to rise most dramatically with <b>Al</b> <b>wool</b> but reaches its greatest magnitude using BN particles. For these material combinations, {{the increase in}} volume fraction of conductive filler is observed to be more significant than polymer type in the enhancement of thermal conductivity. 2 ̆...|$|E

40|$|Effluent {{from the}} wool {{scouring}} industry {{is considered to}} be the most strongly polluting waste in the whole textile industry (Anderson & Wood, 1973). It typically contains 3, 000 to 21, 000 mg/l wool grease, 7, 000 to 15, 000 mg/l suint salts (salt produced by natural excretions) and 10, 000 to 30, 000 mg/l dirt (sand, vegetable matter and fibre). The biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the effluent can be as high as 40, 000 mg/l and 120, 000 mg/l respectively (Anderson & Wood, 1973; Cail et al., 1986; Christoe & Bateup, 1987; Genon et <b>al.,</b> 1986). Since <b>wool</b> grease can be recovered as a saleable by product (lanolin) a majority of scouring plants around the world use disc centrifuges to recover this valuable product (Chris toe & Bateup, 1987). However, only the best quality of grease (approximately 25 to 45...|$|R
