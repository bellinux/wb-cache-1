In particular, {{there is a}} need for “magnetic” and “acoustic” analogs of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) that can be used to sensitively observe gene expression using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound. We are developing genetic reporters for both of these modalities based on the unique biophysical properties of genetically encoded gas nanostructures known as gas vesicles (GVs). Expressed by <b>aquatic</b> <b>microorganism</b> as a means to control buoyancy, GVs are hollow protein-shelled nano-compartments that exclude water but are permeable to gas.

Xenon partitioning into GVs enables their detection using chemical exchange saturation transfer at sub-nanomolar reporter concentrations. In parallel, we have shown that GVs can be detected with high frequency ultrasound, their physical properties enabling linear, harmonic and collapse-mode imaging in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|Engineered {{nanomaterials}} (ENMs) are key {{drivers for}} the development of highly sophisticated new technologies. As all new attainments, the rapidly increasing used of ENMs raise concerns about their safety for the environment and humans. There is growing evidence showing that if engineered nanomaterials are released into the environment, {{there is a possibility that}} they could cause harm to <b>aquatic</b> <b>microorganisms.</b> Among the divers effects triggering their toxicity the ability of ENMs to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) capable of oxidizing biomolecules is currently considered a central mechanism of toxicity. Therefore, development of sensitive tools for quantification of the ROS generation and oxidative stress are highly sought. After briefly introducing ENMs-induced ROS generation and oxidative stress in the <b>aquatic</b> <b>microorganisms</b> (AMOs), this overview paper focuses on a new optical biosensor allowing sensitive and dynamic measurements of H[subscript 2]O[subscript 2] in real-time using multiscattering enhanced absorption spectroscopy. Its principle is based on sensitive absorption measurements of the heme protein cytochrome c whose absorption spectrum alters with the oxidation state of constituent ferrous Fe[superscript II] and ferric Fe[superscript III]. For biological applications cytochrome c was embedded in porous random media resulting in an extended optical path length through multiple scattering of light, which lowers the limit of detection to a few nM of H[subscript 2]O[subscript 2]. The sensor was also integrated in a microfluidic system containing micro-valves and sieves enabling more complex experimental conditions. To demonstrate its performance, abiotic absorption measurements of low concentrations of dye molecules and 10 nm gold particles were carried out achieving limits of detection in the low nM range. Other biologically relevant reactive oxygen species can be measured at sub-μM concentrations, which was shown for glucose and lactate through enzymatic reactions producing H[subscript 2]O[subscript 2]. In ecotoxicological investigations H[subscript 2]O[subscript 2]excreted by <b>aquatic</b> <b>microorganisms</b> exposed to various stressors were measured.

The main driver of toxicity was found to be the percentage of surface content of Ce 3 + sites: CNP 1 (58 %) and CNP 5 (40 %) were found to be toxic whereas CNP 2 (28 %), CNP 3 (36 %) and CNP 4 (26 %) were found to be non-toxic. The colloidal stability and redox chemistry of the most and least toxic CNPs, CNP 1 and CNP 2, respectively, were modified by incubation with iron and phosphate buffers. Blocking surface Ce 3 + sites of the most toxic CNP, CNP 1, with phosphate treatment reverted toxicity and stimulated growth. Colloidal destabilization with Fe treatment only increased toxicity of CNP 1.

Some bacterial pathogens have been previously found in extreme climates such as the Polar Circle area. Surprisingly, the investigation of fresh water from lakes north of the Polar Circle in Sweden revealed the presence of P. shigelloides. Non-agglutinating isolates were found which suggest the finding of new serovars. Molecular techniques showed that they were genotypically different. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed that P. shigelloides presents a natural resistance to b-lactams despite the geographical region from where they were isolated. Furthermore, some strains may carry genes for resistance to tetracyclines. A correct identification of bacteria is crucial to determine the adequate treatment and for epidemiological studies. P. shigelloides is not specified in many clinical laboratories; therefore, a PCR for specific detection of this bacterium was developed. Detection was successful for all the isolates tested despite their serovar, source of isolation or geographical origin. The primers did not amplify genetic material from close related bacteria. Various molecular techniques were evaluated for genotyping P. shigelloides of the same serovar. PFGE and RAPD showed the highest discriminatory skills detecting 22 and 21 genotypes, respectively, among 24 strains. Animal-human pairs from the same geographical area presented an equal genotype. This finding is the first molecular evidence of the possible role of P. shigelloides as a zoonotic agent.

40|$|Hybrid gas-liquid {{electrical}} discharge {{has been}} investigated {{in recent years as}} an innovative technology for contaminated water treatment. A high-voltage pulsed power supply is commonly needed for generation of electrical discharges. In previous study, we have evaluated the degradation efficiency of electrical discharges with alternating current (AC) power since it is generally cheaper than a pulsed one. An AC power supply with a fixed voltage of 13 kV and a fixed frequency of 60 Hz is therefore adopted in this study for inactivation of <b>aquatic</b> <b>microorganism.</b> The time courses of pH, conductivity and inactivation efficiency were determined in a hybrid gas-liquid reactor. The obtained results showed that the pH decreased from 6. 9 to 4 within 15 min of AC electrical discharges. By compared with a set of comparative experiment, the inactivation of E. coli is mainly contributed by electrical discharges but not by the low pH solution. On the other hand, buffer solutions (carbonate and phosphate) could reduce the inactivation efficiency due to consumption of chemically active species formed in electrical discharges. Previous study also found that the plasma-treated water has the residual inactivation ability to kill E. coli, and E. coli might own the environmental adaptation ability to electrical discharges. Either ultrasound or plasma discharge is capable of inactivation of microorganisms in liquid phase. A novel method by combining these two techniques or calls ultrasound-assisted plasmais proposed. Extensive experimental tests were carried out with two kinds of electrode layout (submerged and hybrid reactors), aeration or not, and two microorganisms E. coli and yeast. For a submerged reactor without aeration, the inactivation efficiency achieved with USaP (USaP) is not only greater than US or plasma, but also greater than the summation of US and plasma. In other words, a synergistic effect was observed. It is also noted that synergistic effect was neither observed in hybrid reactor nor in aeration cases. Synergism mechanism is speculatively in virtue of the bubbles generated by ultrasound which lead to easier plasma discharges in water. This study will continue previous research to change types of electrical discharges. The time courses of pH and inactivation efficiency need to be understood in ultrasound-assisted plasma. Whether E. coli own the environmental adaptation ability in ultrasound-assisted plasma will also present in this study. Extensive experimental tests will carried out with kinds of electrode layout, aeration with different gases or not, and three microorganisms. [[abstract]]非熱電漿技術在廢水處理的應用已被廣泛的研究應用於食品或液體的殺菌、大氣的殺菌及去除有害化學物質。在先前研究中，已發現以AC液相電漿進行殺菌實驗，結果刷對面的實驗結果比針對面的實驗具有較佳的殺菌效果，可能是刷狀電極在放電的過程中，觀察到電弧光(spark) 會跳動，可能因而使其殺菌效果較佳。AC液相電漿的放電過程，pH值均會下降，但是低pH值在電漿系統中的殺菌效能不大，但是低pH值有助於電漿系統中的殺菌效率的提升。AC液相電漿實驗也發現放電前後大腸桿菌似乎有突變的情形發生，而且可能造成環境適應力的上升。超音波輔助電漿的加成效應只發生在無曝氣的純液相系統，曝氣時則不會發生。加成效應並不會發生於氣-液混合式的反應器，無論有無曝氣都不會發生。 超音波輔助電漿可能是未來殺菌的新技術，相信此技術將可為廢污水及食物的殺菌效能帶來更大的提升。本研究將延續上述實驗，將先改變電極形式，先尋找出較佳超音波輔助電漿的殺菌效率，並探討不同pH值是否影響超音波輔助電漿殺菌效率。再者，超音波輔助電漿是否也會造成的突變，進而使環境適應力上升也將一併進行研究；再者，進行同時去除三種微生物的實驗(大腸桿菌、枯草桿菌及酵母菌) 以了解合併處理時，殺菌效率是否受影響...|$|E
2500|$|Secondary {{treatment}} is {{the portion of}} a sewage treatment sequence removing dissolved and colloidal compounds measured as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). [...] Secondary {{treatment is}} traditionally applied to the liquid portion of sewage after primary treatment has removed settleable solids and floating material. Secondary treatment is typically performed by indigenous, <b>aquatic</b> <b>microorganisms</b> in a managed aerobic habitat. Bacteria and protozoa consume biodegradable soluble organic contaminants (e.g. sugars, fats, and organic short-chain carbon molecules from human waste, food waste, soaps and detergent) while reproducing to form cells of biological solids. Biological oxidation processes are sensitive to temperature and, between 0°C and 40°C, the rate of biological reactions increase with temperature. Most surface aerated vessels operate at between 4°C and 32°C.|$|R
50|$|Most {{natural waters}} contain small {{quantities}} of organic compounds. <b>Aquatic</b> <b>microorganisms</b> {{have evolved to}} use some of these compounds as food. Microorganisms living in oxygenated waters use dissolved oxygen to oxidatively degrade the organic compounds, releasing energy which is used for growth and reproduction. Populations of these microorganisms tend to increase in proportion to the amount of food available. This microbial metabolism creates an oxygen demand proportional to the amount of organic compounds useful as food. Under some circumstances, microbial metabolism can consume dissolved oxygen faster than atmospheric oxygen can dissolve into the water or the autotrophic community (algae, cyanobacteria and macrophytes) can produce. Fish and aquatic insects may die when oxygen is depleted by microbial metabolism.|$|R
40|$|Protozoa feed on and {{regulate}} {{the abundance of}} most types of <b>aquatic</b> <b>microorganisms,</b> and they {{are an integral part}} of all aquatic microbial food webs. Being so small, aerobic protozoa thrive at low oxygen tensions, where they feed (largely unaffected by metazoan grazing) on the abundance of other microorganisms. In anaerobic environments, they are the only phagotrophic organisms, and they live in unique symbiotic consortia with methanogens, sulphate reducers and non-sulphur purple bacteria. The number of extant species of protozoa may be quite modest (the global number of ciliate species is estimated at 3000), and most of them probably have cosmopolitan distributions. This will undoubtedly make it easier to carry out further tasks, e. g. understanding the role of protozoan species diversity in the natural environment...|$|R
