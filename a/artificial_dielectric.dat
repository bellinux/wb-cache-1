Photonic crystals (PCs), two- or three-dimensionally periodic, <b>artificial,</b> and <b>dielectric</b> structures, {{have a specific}} forbidden band for electromagnetic waves, referred to as photonic bandgap (PBG). The PBG {{is analogous to the}} electronic bandgap in natural crystal structures with periodic atomic arrangement. A well-defined and embedded planar, line, or point defect within the PCs causes a break in its structural periodicity, and introduces a state in the PBG for light localization. It offers various applications in integrated optics and photonics including optical filters, sharp bending light guides and very low threshold lasers. Using nanofabrication processes, PCs of the 2 -D slab-type and 3 -D layer-by-layer structures have been investigated widely. Alternatively, simple and low-cost self-assembled PCs with full 3 -D PBG, inverse opals, have been suggested.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{modification}} of the antenna theory (AT) model of the lightning return stroke to include inductive load-ing is presented. The distributed inductive energy-storing elements {{are used in the}} modified AT model (designated as ATIL model, where IL stands for inductive loading) to control the propaga-tion speed of the upward traveling current wave without using an <b>artificial,</b> higher permittivity <b>dielectric</b> medium, as done in the original AT model. The variation of the propagation speed along the channel is also considered in the proposed model. As in the original AT model, resistive loading is used to account for the cur-rent attenuation with height. Numerical solution of the electric field integral equation in the time domain using the method of mo-ments with appropriate boundary conditions yields a time–space distribution of current along the lightning channel. This current distribution and the resultant electromagnetic fields for the ATIL model are compared with those predicted by other time-domain and frequency-domain electromagnetic models. The current dis-tribution predicted by the ATIL model exhibits features (such as current dispersion) that are more consistent with optical observa-tions of lightning compared to the predictions of the original AT model.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new version}} of an <b>artificial</b> <b>dielectric</b> substrate. The substrate is fabricated as a 2 D array of metallic posts separated from the top conductor by a thin dielectric slab. This structure can show a very high effective permittivity.

40|$|At {{a choice}} of slow-wave {{structure}} for application in accelerating technique the main attention is given first of all to its two characteristics: 1) opportunity of use of a partial type of structures in the wider range of energies and 2) the transformation efficiency of high-frequency energy, put to structure, into a kinetic energy of accelerated particles, that eventually leads to comparison of structures on shunt impedance. From this point of view, the waveguides loaded by dielectric disks have doubtless advantages before other traditionally used structures [1]. Really, the acceleration of particles in waveguide dielectric structures can be realized in a wide velocity band from β = 0, 1 up to 1, 0, that {{is especially important for}} acceleration of heavy charged particles. Here β = v/c-dimensionless velocity, v- velocity of a particle, c- velocity of light. Let us note, that the slow-wave structures of accelerators with the use of dielectrics were historically the first offered structures, however, necessity of a realization of particle acceleration through the vacuum channel, at which the redistribution of an energy stream occurs between the channel and dielectric medium, and absence of natural dielectric materials with necessary properties have to provide searching for and development of all-metal slow-wave structures. The use of <b>artificial</b> anisotropic <b>dielectric</b> mediums in the form of waveguides loaded by periodically placed dielectric disks allows more effectively to use energy, put to the waveguide, and a wide spectrum of different dielectrics. Thus, now, waveguide dielectric slow-wave structures are considered as one of perspective directions in accelerating technique. The earlier theoretical and experimental investigations show a fundamental opportunity of making non-regular waveguide dielectric structures with a varying phase velocity of a wave along an axes of an accelerating channel in the pi/ 2 - mode of the E 01 -wave. It became possible due to use of a condition of a longitudinal waveguide dielectric resonance (LWDR) [2], which is observed in the below cutoff waveguide with a dielectric load, when the single disk resonant frequency is made equal to the resonant frequency of disk system in the waveguid...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{photonic}} crystals, <b>artificial</b> materials whose <b>dielectric</b> properties can be tailored {{according to the}} stacking of its constituents, remains an attractive research area. In this article we have employed a transfer matrix treatment to study the propagation of light waves in Fibonacci quasiperiodic dieletric multilayers with graphene embedded. We calculated their dispersion and transmission spectra in order to investigate {{the effects of the}} graphene monolayers and quasiperiodic disorder on the system physical behavior. The quasiperiodic dieletric multilayer is composed of two building blocks, silicon dioxide (building block A = SiO 2) and titanium dioxide (building block B = TiO 2). Our numerical results show that the presence of graphene monolayers reduces the transmissivity on the whole range of frequency and induces a transmission gap in the low frequency region. Regarding the polarization of the light wave, we found that the transmission coefficient is higher for the transverse magnetic (TM) case than for the transverse electric (TE) one. We also conclude from our numerical results that the graphene induced photonic bandgaps (GIPBGs) do not depend on the polarization (TE or TM) of the light wave nor on the Fibonacci generation index n. Moreover, the GIPBGs are omnidirectional photonic band gaps, therefore light cannot propagate in this structures for frequencies lower than a certain value, whatever the incidence angle. Finally, a plot of the transmission spectra versus chemical potential shows that one can, in principle, adjust the width of the photonic band gap by tuning the chemical potential via a gate voltage.

40|$|Photonic {{structures}} are <b>artificial</b> materials whose <b>dielectric</b> constant is periodically-modulated in one, {{two or three}} dimensions. In a manner analogous {{to the creation of}} electronic bands, electromagnetic waves propagating in the structure are organized into photonic bands, which are separated by bandgaps where propagating states are forbidden. Spontaneous emission is suppressed for photons inside the photonic bandgap, offering novel approaches to creating high-efficiency light-emitting structures. The objective of this thesis is to assess a broad range of issues concerning the use of photonic structures in light-emitting devices based on GaAs. A comprehensive review was undertaken to identify the most suitable techniques for modelling, fabrication and experimental assessment of photonic structures in this context. The key results are: (1) The most appropriate method for calculating photonic band structure is the plane wave method, which was used with real-world values for the dielectric constant to identify appropriate dimensions for prototype structures. However the transfer matrix method is better for calculating the transmission and reflection coefficients, which are quantities that can be compared directly with experimental results. Software was written to extend this method to structures with hexagonal symmetry. (2) Electron beam lithography and electron cyclotron plasma etching were used to fabricate two-dimensional photonic structures in GaAs-based materials. Highly-uniform structures were produced over areas up to 200 #mu#m" 2, and with feature sizes down to 50 nm. This etching technique, which uses low energy ions, is particularly suited to device processing because it causes less etch damage. Other structures reported in the literature have used high-energy etch processes. (3) An experimental setup was developed to measure the transmission and reflection through a photonic structure etched into a waveguide. The technique, which uses a broadband light source to provide a wide spectral range, should allow the observation of both band edges on the same sample - this has not been achieved in any reported measurements.
