That it is a reasonable and proper thing to ask our statesmen and politicians: what is going to happen to the world? What sort of better social order are you making for? What sort of world order are you creating? Let them open their minds to us, let them put upon permanent record the significance of all their intrigues and manoeuvres. Then as they go on we can check their capacity and good faith. We can establish a control at last that will rule presidents and kings.|$|E

We dont really know whats right and whats wrong. We're all right as long as things go on the way they always did. We bring our {{children}} up {{just as we were}} brought up; and we go to church or chapel just as our parents did; and we say what everybody says; and it goes on all right until something out of the way happens: theres a family quarrel, or one of the children goes wrong, or a father takes to drink, or an aunt goes mad, or one of us finds ourselves doing something we never thought we'd want to do. And then you know what happens: complaints and quarrels and huff and offence and bad language and bad temper and regular bewilderment as if Satan possessed us all. We find out then that with all our respectability and piety, weve no real religion and no way of telling right from wrong. Weve nothing but our habits; and when theyre upset, where <b>are</b> <b>we?</b> <b>Just</b> like Peter in the storm trying to walk on the water and finding he couldnt.|$|E

5000|$|I’ve spent 25 years {{heading off}} alone into deserts, and jungles and tundra; I’ve {{been to the}} last remote corners of our planet. Back in the 16th and 17th centuries, {{in the age of}} discovery, men set out to find whole new worlds. The 18th and 19th centuries was the era of exploration, when adventurers went to exploit these discoveries. The last century though was the age of the traveller, when the world was safe enough for {{individuals}} to make their own way, to set off and record their personal impressions; as it happens the British particularly loved to do this…But why, and what does this say about us? Is it a legacy of the British Empire? Or perhaps being members of only a small off-shore nation we’ve learnt that we need to study the curious ways of foreigners in order to survive. Or <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> trying to escape what is, let’s face it, a very safe but overcrowded little island?

[...] In September 2007 during a speech on the Iraq war, Obama introduced Brzezinski as [...] "one of our most outstanding thinkers," [...] but some pro-Israel commentators questioned his criticism of the Israel lobby in the United States. In a September 2009 interview with The Daily Beast, Brzezinski replied to a question about how aggressive President Obama should be in insisting Israel not conduct an air strike on Iran, saying: [...] "We are not exactly impotent little babies. They have to fly over our airspace in Iraq. <b>Are</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> going to sit there and watch?" [...] This was interpreted by some supporters of Israel as supporting the downing of Israeli jets by the United States in order to prevent an attack on Iran. In 2011, Brzezinski supported the NATO intervention against the forces of Muammar Gaddafi in the Libyan Civil War, calling non-intervention [...] "morally dubious" [...] and [...] "politically questionable".|$|E
