40|$|The {{replacement}} of non-scheduled traffic by scheduled services {{is one of}} the main impacts that the liberalisation of the European Common Aviation Area has had on tourist airports. In the case of Faro, between 1996 and 2013, this shift led to both fewer routes served and reduced catchment areas in the source markets for tourists visiting the Algarve. The strategy pursued by Ryanair, the airport’s main carrier, focuses on connections that already channelled a greater volume of traffic when charter airlines dominated. Therefore, the impact of low-cost carriers on diversifying the number <b>of</b> <b>airports</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and source markets is limited. Moreover, using the spatial analysis functions of GIS software, we verified that the population linked to the theoretical catchment areas <b>of</b> <b>airports</b> with a non-stop flight to Faro in 2013 was smaller than that <b>of</b> the <b>airports</b> with such connections in 2000. The decision-making process involved in the policy incentives for introducing new routes could benefit greatly from this type of analysis...|$|R
5000|$|After the September 11 attacks, a call {{went out}} for all planes {{to return to their}} <b>airports</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> (or if they did not have enough fuel, to land in Canadian territory). While {{discussing}} the day's events with the Korean Air office, the pilot of Flight 85 included the letters [...] "HJK" [...] (the code for [...] "hijacked") in an airline text message. When the pilot sent his message, the text messaging service company, Aeronautical Radio, Incorporated (ARINC) noticed the [...] "HJK" [...] code. ARINC officials, worried that the South Korean pilots might be sending a coded message for help, notified North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). Taking no chances, NORAD scrambled F-15 jets from Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage to intercept the 747, with Alaska air traffic control (ATC) asking the pilots coded questions. Civil airline pilots are trained to answer these questions in a coded way if hijacked.|$|R

50|$|In airliners, cabin {{altitude}} during flight is kept {{above sea level}} {{in order to reduce}} stress on the pressurized part of the fuselage; this stress is proportional to the difference in pressure inside and outside the cabin. In a typical commercial passenger flight, the {{cabin altitude}} is programmed to rise gradually from the altitude of the <b>airport</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> to a regulatory maximum of 8000 ft. This cabin altitude is maintained while the aircraft is cruising at its maximum altitude and then reduced gradually during descent until the cabin pressure matches the ambient air pressure at the destination.|$|E
50|$|Minutes after {{departing from}} Haile Selassie I International Airport bound for Paris, when the {{aircraft}} was flying at some 29000 ft, seven {{members of the}} Eritrean Liberation Front stood up and tried {{to gain control of}} the plane. A hand grenade that was armed by one of the hijackers was rolled down the aisle by a passenger. The grenade exploded in the rear part of the fuselage, some 6 in off the plane's centreline, blowing a hole in the cabin floor and damaging or severing several controls of the aircraft, including those of throttle of two engines, of the rudder, and of the horizontal stabiliser. Despite this, the crew turned back the airplane to the <b>airport</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and managed to land it safely; it sustained minor damages that were repaired later.|$|E
