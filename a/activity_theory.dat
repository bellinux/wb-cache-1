25|$|<b>Activity</b> <b>theory,</b> in {{contrast}} to disengagement theory, implies that the more active elderly people are, {{the more likely they}} are to be satisfied with life. The view that elderly adults should maintain well-being by keeping active has had a considerable history and since 1972, this has come to be known as <b>activity</b> <b>theory.</b> However, this theory may be just as inappropriate as disengagement for some people as the current paradigm on the psychology of ageing is that both disengagement theory and <b>activity</b> <b>theory</b> may be optimal for certain people in old age, depending on both circumstances and personality traits of the individual concerned. There are also data which query whether, as <b>activity</b> <b>theory</b> implies, greater social activity is linked with well-being in adulthood.|$|E
25|$|<b>Activity</b> <b>theory</b> (AT): A Soviet {{psychological}} meta-theory, paradigm, or framework, {{with its}} roots in socio-cultural approach. Its founders were Alexei Nikolaevich Leontyev, and S. L. Rubinshtein (1889–1960). It {{became one of the}} major psychological approaches in the former USSR, being widely used in both theoretical and applied psychology, in areas such as the education, training, ergonomics, and work psychology.|$|E
25|$|<b>Activity</b> <b>theory</b> was {{developed}} and elaborated by Cavan, Havighurst, and Albrecht. According to this theory, older adults' self-concept depends on social interactions. In order for older adults to maintain morale in old age, substitutions must be made for lost roles. Examples of lost roles include retirement from a job or loss of a spouse.|$|E
40|$|Building upon Eck and Clarke’s (2003) {{ideas for}} {{explaining}} crimes {{in which there}} is no face-to-face contact between victims and offenders, the authors developed an adapted lifestyle–routine <b>activities</b> <b>theory.</b> Traditional conceptions of place-based environments depend on the convergence of victims and offenders in time and physical space to explain opportunities for victimization. With their proposed cyberlifestyle–routine <b>activities</b> <b>theory,</b> the authors moved beyond this conceptualization to explain opportunities for victimization in cyberspace environments where traditional conceptions of time and space are less relevant. Cyberlifestyle–routine <b>activities</b> <b>theory</b> was tested using a sample of 974 college students on a particular type of cybervictimization—cyberstalking. The study’s findings provide support for the adapted theoretical perspective. Specifically, variables measuring online exposure to risk, online proximity to motivated offenders, online guardianship, online target attractiveness, and online deviance were significant predictors of cyberstalking victimization.

25|$|In {{opposition}} to the Disengagement Theory the <b>Activity</b> <b>Theory</b> of old age argues that disengagement in old age occurs not by desire, but by the barriers to social engagement imposed by society. This theory has been faulted for not factoring in psychological changes that occur in old age as shown by reduced activity even when available. It has also been found that happiness in old age is not proportional to activity.|$|E
25|$|Continuity {{theory is}} the view that in ageing people are {{inclined}} to maintain, {{as much as they}} can, the same habits, personalities and styles of life that they have developed in earlier years. Continuity theory is Atchley's theory that individuals, in later life, make adaptations to enable them to gain a sense of continuity between {{the past and the present}} and the theory implies that this sense of continuity helps to contribute to well-being in later life. Disengagement theory, <b>activity</b> <b>theory</b> and continuity theory are social theories about ageing, though all may be products of their era rather than a valid, universal theory.|$|E
25|$|Activity is {{preferable}} to inactivity because it facilitates well-being on multiple levels. Because of improved general health and prosperity in the older population, remaining active is more feasible now than when this theory was first proposed by Havighurst nearly six decades ago. The <b>activity</b> <b>theory</b> is applicable for a stable, post-industrial society, which offers its older members many opportunities for meaningful participation.Weakness: Some aging persons cannot maintain a middle-aged lifestyle, due to functional limitations, lack of income, or lack {{of a desire to}} do so. Many older adults lack the resources to maintain active roles in society. On the flip side, some elders may insist on continuing activities in late life that pose a danger to themselves and others, such as driving at night with low visual acuity or doing maintenance work to the house while climbing with severely arthritic knees. In doing so, they are denying their limitations and engaging in unsafe behaviors.|$|E
40|$|Using {{a sample}} of online consumers, an {{examination}} of routine <b>activities</b> <b>theory</b> and {{the general theory of}} crime, specifically self-control, was conducted to assess the effect of cybercrime victimization from FBI, Hitman, ransomware, romance, vehicle, and real-estate scams, in addition to identity theft and credit/debit card fraud. Respondents were solicited by an online survey distribution tool in which 190 people were identified as frequent online shoppers who also use social networking websites. The results indicated that the routine activities and self-control frameworks are not indicators of cybercrime victimizations. Only one attribute from routine <b>activities</b> <b>theory,</b> exposure to motivated offender, was found to have a significant relationship with cybercrime victimization, but the effect was relatively minor. Additionally, demographic variables were assessed and were not found to have a significant relationship with victimization. The sole significant result, which coincides with theory, found that being exposed to a motivated offender increases the likelihood of being victimized. Although other components of routine <b>activities</b> <b>theory</b> and self-control theory were not significant, future research should continue to explore how online activities effect the probability of victimization. ...|$|R

This thesis aims to apply routine <b>activities</b> <b>theory</b> to examine the impact of football games on crime by focusing on how a change of football fans' routine activities can affect a change in crime at the aggregate level. Using a quasi experimental design, the study paired the 76 game days with the 76 comparable non-game days. Two analytical strategies were applied, including a binomial test and a t test. The results of the study suggest that football games have some impact on crime. On average, there are small increases in burglary and auto theft and a moderate increase in car prowl (theft of auto) on a game day...|$|R
2500|$|Routine <b>activity</b> <b>theory,</b> {{developed}} by Marcus Felson and Lawrence Cohen, draws upon control theories and explains crime {{in terms of}} crime opportunities that occur in everyday life. A crime opportunity requires that elements converge in time and place including (1) a motivated offender, (2) suitable target or victim, and (3) lack of a capable guardian. A guardian at a place, such as a street, could include security guards or even ordinary pedestrians who would witness the criminal act and possibly intervene or report it to police. Routine <b>activity</b> <b>theory</b> was expanded by John Eck, who added a fourth element of [...] "place manager" [...] such as rental property managers who can take nuisance abatement measures.|$|E

"Activity-based" [...] {{means that}} {{for people to}} learn, a real object has to be {{actually}} present; as Jacinta Correia puts it: [...] "{{to learn how to}} ride a bike, you need a bike to ride on". Thus, for a large group to learn how to manage a complex enterprise, it has to have a complex enterprise to manage. In the OW context, this means that a group averaging 150, many of whom often with lower levels of education, are actively engaged, for an entire month, in (a) productive or service provision enterprise(s). For all the apparent, e.g., on-the-job training and action learning parallels, the OW's defining features are not only the need for a cooperative large group and the creation of (a) complex, real enterprise(s), but, principally, the position of the trainer {{and the way in which}} training messages are communicated. In OW-learning, the trainer's role is merely subsidiary (known as [...] "scaffolding" [...] in <b>activity</b> <b>theory).</b> In other words, it is not the trainer/instructor, but [...] "the object that teaches".|$|E

This study aims to empirically assess cyber-harassment victimization in South Korea via Cyber-Routine <b>Activities</b> <b>Theory</b> (2008).

40|$|After briefly {{attempting}} to describe situated action and distributed cognition, we examine their {{contributions from the}} point of view of <b>activity</b> <b>theories</b> and more specifically based on the relations between the functioning and development of activity. We argue that situated action identifies a limit in cognitive psychology in seeking to bring the subject back into the situation and in reintegrating him/her socially. However, in situating the organization of action outside the subject, it is finally the characteristics of the situation that explain activity. This epistemological pendulum, already discussed by H.

40|$|While past {{research}} has suggested possible seasonal trends in crime rates, this study employs a novel methodology that directly models these changes and predicts them with explanatory variables. Using a nonlinear latent curve model, seasonal fluctuations in crime rates are modeled {{for a large}} number of communities in the U.

First, the empirical validity of RA theory is assessed by examining the pattern of multivariate findings for four key concepts (target attractiveness, guardianship, deviant lifestyles, and exposure to potential offenders). Next, the pattern of findings is examined to determine if they are invariant across time/space/place. Third, areas of conceptual ambiguity are highlighted by identifying variables categorized under more than one key concept. Finally, the theoretical implications, limitations of the current study, and areas for future research are discussed. ...|$|R
