40|$|AbstractInclusion {{control in}} LF-VD process for {{ultra-low}} oxygen alloyed structural steel is investigated. It is found that after <b>Al-deoxidation</b> during tapping process, with slag of high basicity, high Al 2 O 3 content and low oxidizing property, Al 2 O 3 inclusions, {{which are the}} product of <b>Al-deoxidation</b> could transform to MgO-Al 2 O 3 spinel, and later on to CaOMgO-Al 2 O 3 inclusions of lower melting point, which are inclined to be eliminated by floatation, thus total oxygen content would be lowered. On the other hand, residual inclusions in steel are mostly ultra-fine in size, and could be deformed slightly in hot-working process of steel, enhancing fatigue life of steel...|$|E

In {{order to}} improve fatigue life of wheel steel, secondary-refining process is done with <b>Al-deoxidation</b> and slag of high basicity, high Al 2 O 3 content and low {{oxidizing}} property. By slag-steel-inclusion interaction, harmful inclusions could be controlled well to be eliminated by floation, lowering T[O] content to 0. 0007 % in round billets, enhancing fatigue life of wheel steel. It is found that (Al 2 O 3) in slag is positive factor for decrease of T[O], while (CaO) /(Al 2 O 3), (SiO 2) in slag and [Al]s in molten steel is negative factor for it. As a result, by INSTRON fatigue testing machine, tested steel samples achieve ultra-high cycle of 10 8 above, realizing experimental purpose of improving fatigue life of wheel steel...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve fatigue life of wheel steel, secondary-refining process was done with <b>Al-deoxidation</b> and slag of high basicity, high Al 2 O 3 content and low {{oxidizing}} property. By morphology observation and composition analysis with FESEM, {{it is found that}} during LF-VD process, by slag-steel-inclusion interaction, Al 2 O 3 inclusions could transform to MgO-Al 2 O 3 spinel, and later on to CaO-MgO-Al 2 O 3 inclusions, which are inclined to be eliminated by floatation, lowering T[O] content to 0. 0007 %, enhancing fatigue life of wheel steel. By In-Situ observation with CONFOCAL laser scanning microscope, it is found that MnS precipitates during solidification process, which would core oxide inclusion to form MnS-oxide complex inclusion, contributing to fatigue life improvement of wheel steel. By INSTRON fatigue testing machine, it is found that by successful inclusion control, tested samples achieve ultra-high cycle of 10 8 above, realizing experimental purpose of improving fatigue life of wheel steel, boosting domestic production process of CRH high speed wheel steel. 1...|$|E
40|$|Two {{industrial}} {{studies and}} {{one set of}} lab scale trials have been done. In addition, a theoretical study has been done. The main {{focus has been on}} non metallic inclusion composition during the ladle refining operation in industrial steel production. Sampling has been done together with careful inclusion determination. The inclusion composition is related to different variables. In the industrial trials samples have been taken at different steps during the ladle refining period. Steel and slag composition as well as temperature and oxygen activity have been determined. The thesis is based on five supplements with different major objectives, all related to the inclusion composition. The equilibrium top slag-steel bulk and inclusions-steel bulk were investigated by comparison between calculated and measured oxygen activity values. The oxygen activity and relation to temperature has also been discussed as well as oxygen activity and temperature gradients. The effect of vacuum pressure on inclusion composition has been evaluated in a theoretical study as well as lab scale trials. The inclusion composition has been studied during the industrial ladle treatment process. The inclusion composition was related to top slag composition and other parameters during ladle treatment. The major findings in the thesis are the lack of equilibrium conditions with respect to top-slag and steel bulk before vacuum treatment. The inclusions {{have been found to be}} closer to equilibrium with the steel bulk. Al/Al 2 O 3 equilibrium has been found to control the oxygen activity after <b>Al-deoxidation.</b> Evaluation of inclusion composition during the ladle refining has revealed that the majority of the inclusions showed a continuous composition change throughout the ladle refining process, from high Al 2 O 3, via MgO-spinel to finally complex types rich in CaO and Al 2 O 3. The final inclusion composition after vacuum treatment was found to be close to the top slag composition. Vacuum pressure has been found to have a theoretical effect on inclusion composition at very low pressures. QC 2010071...|$|E
