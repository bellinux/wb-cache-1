40|$|Abstract: Many {{factors are}} {{involved}} in estimating total loss of yield potential. These include effects from defoliation, stand loss and plant bruising and environmental condition during the remainder of growing season. Therefore, to evaluate the influence of leaf defoliation on agronomical trials of corn (Zea mays (L.)), a factorial experiment (design:RCB), consisting of three growth stages of maize(vegetative, tasseling and flowering) and five levels of leaf defoliation (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 %) replicated three times in 2011 at <b>agricultural</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> of miandoab (West Azar. Iran). Results revealed that Plant height and ear height was significantly affected by leaf defoliation. Interaction of leaf defoliation×growth stages on seed depth, 1000 -grain weight and grain yield was significant. Seed depth decreased significantly by increasing leaf defoliation only in flowering stage (- 0. 03 mm/ 1 %D). Leaf defoliation diminished 1000 -grain weight and grain yield in all growth stages, thought slope of decreasing in flowering stage was more than others stages. Overall, research demonstrated that flowering stage is more sensitive to leaf defoliation than tasseling and vegetative stage in corn...|$|E

40|$|Extensive {{studies had}} been {{conducted}} to investigate the impacts of climate change on maize growth and yield in recent decades; however, the dynamics of crop husbandry in response and {{adaptation to climate change}} were not taken into account. Based on field observations spanning from 1981 to 2009 at 167 <b>agricultural</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> across China, we found that solar radiation and temperature over the observed maize growth period had decreasing trends during 1981 - 2009, and maize yields were positively correlated with these climate variables in major production regions. The decreasing trends in solar radiation and temperature during maize growth period were mainly ascribed to the adoption of late maturity cultivars with longer reproductive growth period (RGP). The adoption of late maturing cultivars with longer RGP contributed substantially to grain yield increase during the last three decades. The climate trends during maize growth period varied among different production areas. During 1981 - 2009, decreases in mean temperature, precipitation and solar radiation over maize growth period jointly reduced yield most by 13. 2 - 17. 3 % in southwestern China, by contrast in northwestern China increases in mean temperature, precipitation and solar radiation jointly increased yield most by 12. 9 - 14. 4 %. Our findings highlight that the adaptations of maize production system to climate change through shifts of sowing date and genotypes are underway and should be taken into accounted when evaluating climate change impacts.

40|$|The {{experiment}} observations at 120 <b>agricultural</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> spanning from 1981 to 2009 across China {{were used}} to accelerate understandings of the response of wheat growth and productivity to climate change in different climate zones, with panel regression models. We found climate during wheat growth period had changed significantly during 1981 - 2009, and the change had caused measurable impacts on wheat growth and yield {{in most of the}} zones. Wheat anthesis date and maturity date advanced significantly, and the lengths of growth period before anthesis and whole growth period were significantly shortened, however the length of reproductive growth period was significantly prolonged despite of the negative impacts of temperature increase. The increasing adoption of cultivars with longer reproductive growth period offset the negative impacts of climate change and increased yield. Changes in temperature, precipitation and solar radiation in the past three decades jointly increased wheat yield in northern China by 0. 9 - 12. 9 %, however reduced wheat yield in southern China by 1. 2 - 10. 2 %, with a large spatial difference. Our studies better represented crop system dynamics using detailed phenological records, consequently better accounted for adaptations such as shifts in sowing date and crop cultivars photo-thermal traits when quantifying climate impacts on wheat yield. Our findings suggest the response of wheat growth and yield to climate change is underway in China. The changes in crop system dynamics and cultivars traits have to be sufficiently taken into account to improve the prediction of climate impacts and to plan adaptations for future.

40|$|Heat stress {{impacts on}} crop growth and yield have been {{investigated}} by controlled-environment experiments, however {{little is known about}} the impacts under field conditions at large spatial and temporal scales, particularly in a setting with farmers' autonomous adaptations. Here, using detailed experiment Observations at 34 national <b>agricultural</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> spanning from 1981 to 2009 in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain (HHHP) of China, we investigated the changes in climate and heat stress during wheat reproductive growing period (from heading to maturity) and the impacts of climate change and heat stress on reproductive growing duration (RGD) and yield in a setting with farmers' autonomous adaptations. We found that RGD and growing degree days above 0 degrees C (GDD) from heading to maturity increased, which increased yield by similar to 14. 85 %, although heat stress had negative impacts on RGD and yield. During 1981 - 2009, high temperature (> 34 degrees C) degree days (HDD) increased in the northern part, however decreased in the middle and southern parts of HHHP due to advances in heading and maturity dates. Change in HDD, together with increase in GDD and decrease in solar radiation (SRD), jointly increased wheat yield in the northern and middle parts but reduced it in the southern part of HHHP. During the study period, increase in GDD and decrease in SRD had larger impacts on yield than change in HDD. However, with climate warming of 2 degrees C, damage of heat stress on yield may offset a large portion of the benefits from increases in RGD and GDD, and eventually result in net negative impacts on yield in the northern part of HHHP. Our study showed that shifts in cultivars and wheat production system dynamics in the past three decades reduced heat stress impacts in the HHHP. The insights into crop response and adaptation to climate change and climate extremes provide excellent evidences and basis for improving climate change impact study and designing adaptation measures for the future.

40|$|In this study, diurnal soil {{temperature}} fluctuation through a clay soil depth was estimated {{with respect to}} time using a measured data set in a cosinusoidal harmonic equation. Some soil thermal properties, such as amplitude, heat diffusivity, damping depth and retardation time were also determined at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 cm soil depth. The highest amplitude value 12. 31 �C was obtained at the soil surface. However, heat diffusivity, damping depth and retardation time increased at the deeper soil layers compared with the soil surface values. Estimated temperature values by the cosinusoidal harmonic equation fitted very well with the measured values. Estimated temperatures at 10 cm soil depth gave the significant correlations with measured data set by the <b>Agricultural</b> Faculty, <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Station</b> in Ondokuz Mayis University (0. 903 **) and measured temperatures at six times in a day by the researchers (0. 861 **).

40|$|Abstract. Automatic <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> is {{important}} for meteorological observation {{and the existence of}} outliers in the observational data is inevitable. The paper proposes outlier detection for observational data of automatic <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> based on least square support vector machine (LS-SVM). The method establishes the LS-SVM model for the meteorological factor and uses the model to evaluate the observational data. If the observational data deviate from the model, they would be seemed as outliers. The ground temperature data observed by two real automatic <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> are used in experiments. Experiments results verify that the proposed method realize outlier detection for observational data of automatic <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> effectively and ensures subsequent process and analysis of the meteorological data...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, five {{national}} <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> in Anhui province {{are taken}} as typical examples {{to explore the}} effects of local urbanization on their thermal environment by using Landsat data from 1990 to 2010. Satellite-based land use/land cover (LULC), land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are used to investigate the effects. The study shows that LULC around <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> changed significantly due to urban expansion. Fast urbanization is the main factor that affects the spatial-temporal distribution of thermal environment around <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations.</b> Moreover, the normalized LST and NDVI exhibit strong inverse correlations around <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations,</b> so the variability of LST can be monitored through evaluating the variability of NDVI. In addition, station-relocation {{plays an important role}} in improving representativeness of thermal environment. Notably, the environment representativeness was improved, but when using the data from the station to study climate change, the relocation-induced inhomogeneous data should be considered and adjusted. Consequently, controlling the scale and layout of the urban buildings and constructions around <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> is an effective method to ameliorate observational thermal environment and to improve regional representativeness of station observation. The present work provides observational evidences that high resolution Landsat images can be used to evaluate the thermal environment of <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R
