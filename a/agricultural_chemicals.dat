5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of South Asian {{river dolphins}} {{have been very}} adversely affected by human use of the river systems in the subcontinent. Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies' ranges. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and <b>agricultural</b> <b>chemicals</b> may have also contributed to population decline. Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed. Currently, three subpopulations of Indus river dolphins are considered capable of long-term survival if protected.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, {{scientists}} from the University of Maryland and the US Department of Agriculture found {{that a combination of}} pesticides has been contaminating the pollen bees use to feed their hives. When researchers collected pollen from hives on the east coast, they discovered that it was contaminated (on average) with 9 different fungicides and pesticides, although scientists found a blend of 21 different <b>agricultural</b> <b>chemicals</b> in one sample of pollen. Eight ag chemicals were identified to be associated with increased risk of infection by Nosema ceranae.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to those who see the FDA {{as a source of}} excessive regulation, other critics believe that the FDA does not regulate some products strictly enough.

25|$|Most of Tajikistan's {{environmental}} problems {{are related to}} the agricultural policies imposed on the country during the Soviet period. By 1991 heavy use of mineral fertilizers and <b>agricultural</b> <b>chemicals</b> was a major cause of pollution in the republic. Among those chemicals were DDT, banned by international convention, and several defoliants and herbicides. In addition to the damage they have done to the air, land, and water, the chemicals have contaminated the cottonseeds whose oil is used widely for cooking. Cotton farmers and their families are at particular risk from the overuse of <b>agricultural</b> <b>chemicals,</b> both from direct physical contact in the field and from the use of the branches of cotton plants at home for fuel. All of these toxic sources are believed to contribute to a high incidence of maternal and child mortality and birth defects. In 1994 the infant mortality rate was 43.2 per 1,000 births, the second highest rate among former Soviet republics. The rate in 1990 had been 40.0 infant deaths per 1,000 births.|$|E

25|$|Cotton {{requires}} particularly intense irrigation. In Tajikistan's cotton-growing regions, farms {{were established}} in large, semiarid tracts and in tracts reclaimed from the desert, but cotton's growing season is summer, when the region receives virtually no rainfall. The 50 percent increase in cotton cultivation mandated by Soviet and post-Soviet agricultural planners between 1964 and 1994 consequently overtaxed the regional water supply. Poorly designed irrigation networks led to massive runoff, which increased soil salinity and carried toxic <b>agricultural</b> <b>chemicals</b> downstream to other fields, the Aral Sea, and populated areas of the region.|$|E
25|$|Organic cotton is {{generally}} understood as cotton from plants not genetically modified {{and that is}} certified to be grown {{without the use of}} any synthetic <b>agricultural</b> <b>chemicals,</b> such as fertilizers or pesticides. Its production also promotes and enhances biodiversity and biological cycles. In the United States, organic cotton plantations are required to enforce the National Organic Program (NOP). This institution determines the allowed practices for pest control, growing, fertilizing, and handling of organic crops. As of 2007, 265,517 bales of organic cotton were produced in 24 countries, and worldwide production was growing at a rate of more than 50% per year.|$|E
25|$|Eli Lilly and Company {{grew into}} one of the largest {{pharmaceutical}} companies in the world. Under J.K.

In later years the company introduced innovations in antibiotics, such as Ceclor, and antidepressents, such as Prozac, and diversified into <b>agricultural</b> <b>chemicals,</b> animal-health products, and beauty products, among other product lines. According to Forbes, it ranked as the 243rd largest public company in the world in 2016, with sales of $20billion and a market value of $86billion (USD).|$|E

25|$|The PZL-126 Mrówka (ant) is a Polish {{agricultural}} aircraft first flown in 1990. It is a diminutive low-wing monoplane of conventional if stubby appearance with a T-tail, an enclosed cabin and fixed, tricycle undercarriage. Significant {{parts of the}} design were undertaken by students at the training college attached to the PZL plant at Okęcie {{under the direction of}} Andrzej Słocinski, with the whole project treated initially as a platform for design innovation. Initial design work was completed in 1982 and detail work the following year. Plans to fly a prototype by 1985 were delayed by revisions to the aircraft's equipment, although a mockup was displayed at an agricultural aviation exhibition at Olsztyn that August. Legislation to outlaw certain <b>agricultural</b> <b>chemicals</b> was under consideration in Poland in the late 1980s, spurring interest in biological agents as an alternative and making a tiny aircraft like the Mrówka feasible as a useful piece of agricultural equipment.|$|E
25|$|On December 11, 2015, DuPont {{announced}} that it would merge with the Dow Chemical Company, in an all-stock deal. The combined company, which will be known as DowDuPont, will have an estimated value of $130 billion, be equally held by the shareholders of both companies, and maintain their headquarters in Delaware and Michigan respectively. Within two years of the merger's closure, expected {{in the first quarter of}} 2017 and subject to regulatory approval, DowDuPont will be split into three separate public companies, focusing on the <b>agricultural</b> <b>chemicals,</b> materials science, and specialty product industries. Commentators have questioned the economic viability of this plan because, of the three companies, only the specialty products industry has prospects for high growth. The outlook on the profitability of the other two proposed companies has been questioned due to reduced crop prices and lower margins on plastics such as polyethylene. They have also noted that the deal is likely to face antitrust scrutiny in several countries. This eventually became the case, with two delays taking place due to regulatory approvals. The merger closed on August 31, 2017.|$|E
