5|$|Soon, Granville {{had a full}} {{orchestra}} at his disposal, so {{he convinced}} the management committee {{to allow him to}} give classical concerts on Fridays <b>and</b> <b>Sundays.</b> He then embarked on advanced concerts of new composers, as well as his own works.

5|$|Inmates were {{permitted}} {{out into the}} yard on Saturdays <b>and</b> <b>Sundays</b> and on holidays for a maximum of 5 hours. Inmates who worked seven days a week in the kitchen were rewarded with short yard breaks during the weekdays. Badly behaved prisoners were liable to having their yard access rights taken away from them on weekends. The prisoners of Alcatraz {{were permitted}} to play games such as baseball, softball and other sports at these times and intellectual games such as chess. Because of the small size of the yard and the diamond at the end of it, a section of the wall behind the first base had to be padded to cushion the impact of inmates overrunning it. Inmates were provided gloves, bats, and balls, but no sport uniforms. In 1938, there were four amateur teams, the Bees, Oaks, Oilers, and Seals, named after Minor League clubs, and four league teams named after Major League clubs, the Cardinals, Cubs, Giants, and Tigers. Many of the inmates used weekends in the yards to converse with each other and discuss crime, the only real opportunities they had during the week for a durable conversation.|$|E
