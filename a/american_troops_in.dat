5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, George Washington was interned by the then-neutral United States, until that country entered into the conflict in April 1917. George Washington was seized by the United States and taken over {{for use as a}} troop transport by the U.S. Navy. Commissioned as USS George Washington (ID-3018), she sailed with her first load of <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> December 1917.|$|E
5|$|U.S. forces also {{established}} an officer candidate {{school during the}} later part of the war, using instructors selected from the <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> the country. The school conducted two courses and graduated nearly 300 new officers. Just under twenty years later in 1964, the group still made up over 50% of the officer corps of the AFL.|$|E
5|$|The goal of American {{armed forces}} was to {{reinforce}} {{the remnants of the}} South Korean Army (ROK) in fighting back the North Korean invasion (but only in the southeastern part of South Korea, around the major seaport of Pusan) to prevent the complete collapse of the South Korean Army and of the South Korean Government. However, the American armed forces in the Orient had been decreasing steadily since the end of World War II, by mid-1950, there were no <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> South Korea, and the American force in Japan had dwindled drastically.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the player has to allocate a number of <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> order to establish a beachhead on one of the six beaches of the island. However, many of the beaches are scattered with land mines and may provide an initial disadvantage to the assault. Throughout the game, the player may call in air strikes and other assaults, however they are only available after the American forces are attacked or if the enemy retreats to an inaccessible location. At any time in the game, the player is also able to request troop reinforcements from the fleet. Furthermore, Japanese air forces may sink American battleships throughout the game, although the player will {{be given the opportunity to}} shoot them down. In addition, a Japanese submarine will sink American gunboats at random intervals, and cannot be destroyed in any way. There is no save function in the game.|$|E
5|$|Buried {{initially}} in {{an unmarked}} bomb crater in Salamaua, Newton's body was recovered and re-interred in Lae War Cemetery after Salamaua's capture by Allied troops in September 1943. In early 1944, the recently constructed No.4 Airfield in Nadzab was renamed Newton Field in his honour. For many years, {{the story of}} Newton's death was intertwined with that of an Australian commando, Sergeant Len Siffleet, who had also been captured in New Guinea. A famous photograph showing Siffleet about to be executed with a katana was discovered by <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> April 1944 and was thought to have depicted Newton in Salamaua. However, no photograph of the airman's execution is known to exist.|$|E
5|$|Several armies in the Second World War in Northern European {{countries}} preferred separate winter uniforms {{rather than}} oversuits. The Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, {{as well as}} white winter oversuits. Other German units fighting in Eastern Europe were at first poorly equipped for winter, having {{to make do with}} ordinary summer uniforms, but in the winter of 1942 to 1942 new white two-piece hooded oversuits with long mitten gauntlets started to arrive. <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> Europe in the winter of 1944 to 1945 improvised snow capes and helmet covers from white cloth such as bed linen.|$|E

5|$|After the Villa Expedition, Patton was {{detailed}} to Front Royal, Virginia, {{to oversee}} horse procurement for the Army, but Pershing intervened on his behalf. After the United States entered World War I, and Pershing was named {{commander of the}} American Expeditionary Force (AEF) on the Western Front, Patton requested to join his staff. Patton was promoted to captain on May 15, 1917 and left for Europe, among the 180 men of Pershing's advance party which departed May 28 and arrived in Liverpool, England, on June 8. Taken as Pershing's personal aide, Patton oversaw the training of <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> Paris until September, then moved to Chaumont and assigned as a post adjutant, commanding the headquarters company overseeing the base. Patton was dissatisfied with the post and began to {{take an interest in}} tanks, as Pershing sought to give him command of an infantry battalion. While in a hospital for jaundice, Patton met Colonel Fox Conner, who encouraged him to work with tanks instead of infantry.|$|E
5|$|At 07:50, Cota led {{the charge}} off of Dog Green, between WN-68 and WN-70, by forcing gaps in the wire with a Bangalore torpedo and wire cutters. Twenty minutes later, the 5th Rangers joined the advance, and blew more openings. The command party {{established}} themselves {{at the top of}} the bluff, and elements of G/116 and H/116 joined them, having earlier moved laterally along the beach, and now the narrow front had widened to the east. Before 09:00, small parties from F/116 and B/116 reached the crests just east of Dog White. The right flank of this penetration was covered by the survivors of the 2nd Rangers’ A and B companies, who had independently fought their way to the top between 08:00 and 08:30. They took WN-70 (already heavily damaged by naval shells), and joined the 5th Rangers for the move inland. By 09:00 more than 600 <b>American</b> <b>troops,</b> <b>in</b> groups ranging from company sized to just a few men, had reached the top of the bluff opposite Dog White and were advancing inland.|$|E
25|$|On April 21, 1914 an {{incident}} involving U.S. sailors in Tampico led President Woodrow Wilson to land <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> Veracruz, where they remained for six months. Mexico later responded by severing diplomatic relations.|$|E

25|$|Clifford, like McNamara, had to {{deal with}} {{frequent}} requests for additional troops from military commanders in Vietnam. When he became secretary, the authorized force in Vietnam was 525,000. Soon after moving into his Pentagon office, Clifford persuaded Johnson to deny General William Westmoreland's request for an additional 206,000 <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> Vietnam.|$|E

Byers was promoted to temporary Brigadier General on 31 October 1942.|$|E
25|$|The gun {{was taken}} back to Germany in August 1918 as Allied {{advances}} threatened its security. No guns were ever captured by the Allies. It is believed that {{near the end of}} the war they were completely destroyed by the Germans. One spare mounting was captured by <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>in</b> Bruyères-sur-Fère, near Château-Thierry, but the gun was never found; the construction plans seem to have been destroyed as well.|$|E

The Americans looted the town and burned the Parliament Buildings during the brief occupation.|$|E
25|$|On September 12, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff {{recommended}} {{the use of}} nuclear weapons against mainland China.

However, on December 2, 1954, the United States and the ROC agreed to the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, which did not apply to islands along the Chinese mainland.

25|$|No 13 ITW {{was formed}} in Torquay in June 1941 to train pilots, {{observers}} and navigators principally from the Commonwealth and Allied Air Forces.
