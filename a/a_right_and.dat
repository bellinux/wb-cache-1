5|$|The avian {{circulatory system}} {{is driven by}} a four-chambered, myogenic heart {{contained}} in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.|$|E

The Constitution also allows for the death penalty to be exercised for grave crimes, but only in accordance with national law. If citizens are arrested, they are granted due process of law and do not have to testify against themselves or their family members. Citizens are also given the right to vote, housing, compensation for their share of work, and have the ability to move wherever they wish inside Belarus, and have the right to protest against the government.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{respiratory}} tract {{is part of the}} respiratory system, and consists of the trachea and the structures below this including the lungs. The trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place where it splits (the carina) into <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> left bronchus. These supply air to the right and left lungs, splitting progressively into the secondary and tertiary bronchi for the lobes of the lungs, and into smaller and smaller bronchioles until they become the respiratory bronchioles. These in turn supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli, where the exchange of gases take place. Oxygen breathed in, diffuses through the walls of the alveoli into the enveloping capillaries and into the circulation, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the lungs to be breathed out.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the fourth}} week, two {{atrioventricular}} endocardial cushions appear. Initially the atrioventricular canal gives access to the primitive left ventricle, and is separated from arterial bulb by the edge of the ventricular bulb. In the fifth week, the posterior end terminates in the center part of the upper endocardial cushion. Because of this, blood can access both the left primitive ventricle and the right primitive ventricle. As the anterior and posterior pads project inwardly, they merge to form <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> left atrioventricular orifice.|$|E

According to these properties of <b>a</b> <b>right</b> fractional sum <b>and</b> <b>right</b> fractional difference operators, we studied an initial problem and a boundary value problem with two-point boundary conditions.

40|$|In the Andean {{region of}} Latin America {{over one million}} {{adolescent}} girls get pregnant every year. Adolescent pregnancy (AP) {{has been associated with}} adverse health and social outcomes, but it has also been favorably viewed as a pathway to adulthood. AP can also be conceptualized as a marker of inequity, since it disproportionately affects girls from the poorest households and those who {{have not been able to}} attend school. Using results from a study carried out in the Amazon Basin of Ecuador, this paper explores APs and adolescents' sexual and reproductive health from <b>a</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> gender approach. The paper points out the main features of <b>a</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> gender approach, and how it can be applied to explore APs. Afterward it describes the methodologies (quantitative and qualitative) and main results of the study, framing the findings within the <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> gender approach. Finally, some implications that could be generalizable to global research on APs are highlighted. The application of the <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> gender framework to explore APs contributes to a more integral view of the issue. The <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> gender framework stresses the importance of the interaction between rights-holders and duty-bearers on the realization of sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>rights,</b> <b>and</b> acknowledges the importance of gender-power relations on sexual <b>and</b> reproductive decisions. <b>A</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> gender approach could lead to more integral and constructive interventions, and it could also be useful when exploring other sexual and reproductive health matters...|$|R

25|$|Sachsenhausen was {{intended}} to set a standard for other concentration camps, both in its design and the treatment of prisoners. The camp perimeter is, approximately, an equilateral triangle with a semi circular roll call area centered on the main entrance gate in the boundary running northeast to southwest. Barrack huts lie beyond the roll call area, radiating from the gate. The layout {{was intended}} to allow the machine gun post in the entrance gate to dominate the camp but in practice {{it was necessary to}} add additional watchtowers to the perimeter. The standard barrack layout was to have a central washing area and a separate room with toilet bowls and <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> left wing for overcrowded sleeping rooms.|$|E

In the conviction that work is <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> a duty and that every form of occupation deserves respect, the brothers and sisters should commit themselves to collaborate so that all persons may have the possibility to work and so that working conditions may always be more humane. Leisure and recreation have their own value and are necessary for personal development. Secular Franciscans should maintain a balance between work and rest and should strive to make meaningful use of their leisure time.|$|E

25|$|Other {{terms are}} used to {{describe}} the lion's position in further detail. It should be noted that each coat of arms has <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> left (i.e. dexter and sinister) side - with respect to the person carrying the shield - so {{the left side of the}} shield as drawn on the page (thus the right side to the shield bearer) is called the dexter side. The lion's head is normally seen in agreement with the overall position, facing dexter (left) unless otherwise stated. If a lion's whole body is turned to face right, he is to sinister or contourné. If his whole body faces the viewer, he is affronté. If his head only faces the viewer he is guardant or gardant, and if he looks back over his shoulder he is regardant. These adjectives follow any other adjectives of position.|$|E
25|$|The Great Schism {{between the}} Western (Catholic) and Eastern (Orthodox) Christian Churches was sparked in 1054 by Pope Leo IX asserting {{authority}} over {{three of the}} seats in the Pentarchy, in Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria. Since the mid-8th century, the Byzantine Empire's borders had been shrinking in the face of Islamic expansion. Antioch had been wrested back into Byzantine control by 1045, but the resurgent power of the Roman successors in the West claimed <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> a duty for the lost seats in Asia and Africa. Pope Leo sparked a further dispute by defending the filioque clause in the Nicene Creed which the West had adopted customarily. The Orthodox today state that the XXVIIIth Canon of the Council of Chalcedon explicitly proclaimed the equality of the Bishops of Rome and Constantinople. The Orthodox also state that the Bishop of Rome has authority only over his own diocese and does not have any authority outside his diocese. There were other less significant catalysts for the Schism however, including variance over liturgy. The Schism of Roman Catholic and Orthodox followed centuries of estrangement between the Latin and Greek worlds.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of March 21–23, John Brown Baldwin of the Valley’s Augusta County made a Unionist speech, {{beginning}} with a defense of “African slavery, as it exists in Virginia, is <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> a good thing…” But {{he believed that the}} idea that the election of someone to the Presidency could justify secession “as a direct assault upon the fundamental principles of American liberty”. The three branches of government with their Constitutional checks and balances protect against “encroachment upon the liberties of the minority of the people or upon the rights of the States.” And even with the withdrawal of Southern delegations, the remaining Republican majority passed a Constitutional Amendment for ratification prohibiting the Federal Government to interfere with slavery in the states in any respect. “...the great masses of people, leaving out the politicians and fanatics of both sections, have this day an earnest yearning for each other, and for peace and Union with each other…” Baldwin sought a conference of border states to adopt the Peace Convention recommendations that he believed would cause the Confederate states to separately return to the Union.|$|E

500|$|After September 11, Bush {{announced}} a global War on Terror.

In his January 29, 2002 State of the Union Address, he asserted that an [...] "axis of evil" [...] consisting of North Korea, Iran, and Iraq was [...] "arming to threaten {{the peace of the}} world" [...] and [...] "pose a grave and growing danger". The Bush Administration asserted both <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> the intention to wage preemptive war, or preventive war.

500|$|In an {{interview}} book released in 1992, midway through his second term, Weizsäcker voiced a harsh {{critique of the}} leading political parties in Germany, claiming that they took {{a larger role in}} public life than was awarded to them by the constitution. He criticized the high number of career politicians (Berufspolitiker), who [...] "in general are neither expert nor dilettante, but generalists with particular knowledge only in political battle". The immediate reactions toward this interview were mixed. Prominent party politicians such as Rainer Barzel and Johannes Rau criticized the remarks, as did Minister of Labour Norbert Blüm, who asked the president to show more respect towards the work done by party members. Former chancellor Helmut Schmidt, on the other hand, conceded that Weizsäcker was [...] "essentially right". While comments from politicians were mainly negative, a public poll conducted by the Wickert-Institut in June 1992 showed that 87.4 per cent of the population agreed with the president. Political commentators generally interpreted the remarks as a hidden attack on the incumbent chancellor Helmut Kohl, since Weizsäcker's relationship with his former patron had cooled over the years. In a column for the German newspaper Der Spiegel, chief-editor Rudolf Augstein criticized the president for his attack, writing: [...] "You cannot have it both ways: on the one hand giving <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> seminal political incentive, {{but on the other hand}} insulting the governing class and its chief".|$|E
