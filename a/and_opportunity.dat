5|$|Humanity {{lives in}} the deepest reaches of {{explored}} space in a vast region known as The Frontier. It contains many well-known and inhabited star systems, but many more worlds remain uncharted. Most people will never travel this far away from normal civilization, but for pioneers, explorers, mercenaries, outlaws, and soldiers - the Frontier offers both adventure <b>and</b> <b>opportunity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Amtrak assumed {{control of}} almost all private sector {{intercity}} passenger rail service in the United States on May 1, 1971, with a mandate to reverse decades of decline. It retained approximately 184 of the 440 trains which had run the day before. To operate these trains, Amtrak inherited a fleet of 300 locomotives (electric and diesel) and 1190 passenger cars, most of which dated from the 1940s–1950s. These cars were aging, in need of maintenance, {{and in many cases}} incompatible with each other. The company recognized the need <b>and</b> <b>opportunity</b> to standardize on a single design.|$|E
5|$|Carr Hill {{performs}} {{poorly in}} comparison to the wider borough in terms of economic activity <b>and</b> <b>opportunity.</b> Some 42% of children in the ward live in poverty, the second-highest figure in Gateshead. The adult unemployment rate is 7%, compared to 5% borough-wide, the joint third-highest figure in Gateshead. Youth unemployment is 10%, also the joint third-highest in the borough. The income of residents is £24,000; £3,000 below the regional median. Carr Hill has only 70 VAT-registered businesses, compared to a borough average of 230. Only 2.6% of residents are self-employed, compared to 4.5% of the borough and 8.3% nationally. Overall, Carr Hill falls within the most deprived 20% of regions in England according to the Index of Multiple Deprivation in 2010.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three dimensional array of contemporary challenges <b>and</b> <b>opportunities</b> for language <b>and</b> literacy researchers and educators. The challenges <b>and</b> <b>opportunities</b> result from dynamic human migration, {{widespread use of}} mobile digital technology, {{and the development of}} the internet. Recent publications are discussed that exemplify the challenges <b>and</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Particular attention is given to spaces as local contexts for language and literacy learning. Focusing discussion upon the challenges <b>and</b> <b>opportunities</b> is one way of building knowledge about how people use modes of communication to develop, use, and learn language and literacies...|$|R

5|$|Ecosystems are {{regularly}} confronted with natural environmental variations and disturbances {{over time and}} geographic space. A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation. Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods, and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates, species assemblages, and biomass densities within an ecological community. These disturbances create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation <b>and</b> <b>opportunity.</b> Ecological resilience is a cornerstone theory in ecosystem management. Biodiversity fuels the resilience of ecosystems acting {{as a kind of}} regenerative insurance.|$|E
5|$|The craft guilds {{required}} {{relatively stable}} markets and a relative equality of income <b>and</b> <b>opportunity</b> amongst their members to function effectively. By the 14th century these conditions were increasingly uncommon. The first strains {{were seen in}} London, where the old guild system began to collapse – more trade was being conducted at a national level, making it hard for craftsmen to both manufacture goods and trade in them, and there were growing disparities in incomes between the richer and poorer craftsmen. As a result, under EdwardIII many guilds became companies or livery companies, chartered companies focusing on trade and finance, leaving the guild structures to represent {{the interests of the}} smaller, poorer manufacturers.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{returned}} to Australia for the 1947–48 season, keen {{to win a}} place on the 1948 tour to England. He was worried that having played as a professional in the Lancashire League would damage his chance of further Test cricket, {{but at the same time}} suggested that he had offers from other Lancashire League teams to fall back on should he not be picked. There was also concern that, with his wife now living in Scotland, he would breach the Australian rule that wives were not allowed to travel with Test cricketers. In fact, lack of form <b>and</b> <b>opportunity</b> were greater threats to Barnes's continued Test career. Arriving back with several state games having already been played, he failed to make runs for New South Wales and was not picked for the first two Tests against the Indian tourists, Bill Brown taking over as opener with Morris.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 Ian Davis, {{the head}} of the London, UK office, was elected to the {{position}} of managing director. Davis promised a return to the company’s core values, after a period in which the firm had expanded rapidly, which some McKinsey consultants felt was a departure from the company's heritage. Also in 2003, the firm established a headquarters for the Asia-Pacific region in Shanghai, China. By 2004, more than 60 percent of McKinsey's revenues were generated outside the U.S. The company started a Social Sector Office (SSO) in 2008, which is divided into three practices: Global Public Health, Economic Development <b>and</b> <b>Opportunity</b> Creation (EDHOC) and Philanthropy. McKinsey does much of its pro-bono work through the SSO, whereas a Business Technology Office (BTO), founded in 1997, provides consulting on technology strategy.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to taxonomic research, collections can provide information {{relevant to the}} study of variety of other ornithological questions, including comparative anatomy, ecology, behavior, disease, and conservation. Forensic ornithologists use collections to identify species involved in aircraft bird strikes, imported materials containing bird parts, and birds killed through various human activities, legal and illegal. In addition, collections are used by zooarchaeologists to identify bird bones at prehistoric human sites or species of origin for feathers used in human cultural artifacts. Collections also have been heavily used by artists, particularly for the production of plates for ornithological field guides. The close-up observation <b>and</b> <b>opportunity</b> for manipulation provided by preserved study skins makes them, together with field observations and photography, to be an important basis for painters of field guide plates of birds. Most bird species have several unique plumages that distinguish immature from adults, males from females, and breeders from non-breeders. Thus, many different specimens may be required to produce a thorough plate for identification of a given species. Accurate colour measurements using spectrometry are possible from specimens.|$|E

40|$|This paper reports {{business}} related challenges <b>and</b> <b>opportunities</b> for e-maintenance as {{an emerging}} customer value generating IT-enabled resource. The research study {{is concerned with}} the e- maintenance based on remote diagnostics in the vehicle industry. E-maintenance of vehicles is of great importance as e-maintenance technology has great potential to provide various state of the art maintenance related services for the vehicles. This emerging technology brings challenges <b>and</b> <b>opportunities</b> to generate value both for the companies and their customers. In this paper, we have presented several business related challenges <b>and</b> <b>opportunities</b> for e-maintenance. In the form of a set of propositions, the contribution {{of this paper is to}} conceptualize e-maintenance as an emerging customer value generating IT-enabled resource by showing challenges <b>and</b> <b>opportunities</b> related to it...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the individual military punishments, the army took further internal measures to {{lower the risk of}} another insurrection. According to Maurice Rives, 10,000 Vietnamese troops were given transfers to different zones. This meant that more than 80% of Tonkin's approximately 12,000 Tirailleurs Tonkinois were moved, a transfer of enormous proportions, indicating the extent of insecurity among French commanders towards Vietnamese troops, {{and the extent to which}} they were willing to go to make future Yen Bays impossible. One possible rationale for this measure was to break up any undiscovered VNQDĐ cells and to sever personal ties, within units and between soldiers and civilians in their local district. The mass transfer of soldiers also had the effect of creating a state of constant mobilisation, denying troops the time <b>and</b> <b>opportunity</b> for anti-colonial organisation.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} community maintained that Rajoelina's legitimacy was conditional to {{free and fair}} elections. A number of key international organizations in which Madagascar had been a member, including the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union, withheld recognition of Rajoelina's legitimacy throughout his tenure. The United States, Madagascar's largest bilateral donor and provider of humanitarian aid, also refused to acknowledge the Rajoelina administration. The United Nations responded to the power transfer by freezing 600 million euros in planned aid. The United States suspended Madagascar {{from the list of}} beneficiaries of the African Growth <b>and</b> <b>Opportunity</b> Act (AGOA), which had ensured preferential tariffs for the import of Malagasy textiles. This sanction resulted in the loss of over 50,000 jobs and dealt a severe blow to the textile sector, which had accounted for half of Madagascar's exports. Rajoelina initially sought to persuade former donors to recommence their support; when these efforts failed to yield results, he explored the possibility of foregoing the support of traditional partners through new or strengthened relations with such alternatives as Libya, China and Saudi Arabia but was again unable to secure the desired partnerships.|$|E
