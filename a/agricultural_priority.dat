30|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, the DLB has gone through several major changes that drive {{regional}} agricultural and pastoral land changes. First, the regional population has increased at a moderate rate similar to the global population trend. But some areas, especially around urban agglomerations in the East Asian part of the DLB, have increased more rapidly resulting in greater pressure on agricultural and pastoral lands (Qi et al. 2012, 2012; Kraemer et al. 2015). Second, there have been profound institutional shifts in the agricultural sector, primarily in post-Soviet Central Asia where the newly independent states have disparate natural resource endowments. To balance food security with commodities for export, these new nations have shifted their <b>agricultural</b> <b>priorities</b> (for example, replaced high water demanding cotton by wheat) that have altered regional water demands—resulting in agricultural abandonment in some locations and intensification in others (Wright et al. 2012; de Beurs et al. 2015; Kraemer et al. 2015).|$|R

The analysis used a weighted criteria (scoring) approach to generate a ranking of priorities by commodity and by research area. The study is only partly completed. Four objectives for the research system were identified and weighted.

It was concluded from an analysis of current research funding that, although existing funding was in general agreement with the priorities generated by this study, opportunities remain for adjusting resource allocations to agree more closely with these priorities.

40|$|AbstractIn a {{world that}} is {{developing}} fast, Africa's relative stagnation is a human tragedy that challenges the development profession. Although climate and geography, and their effect on local institutions, are not in Africa's favour, inappropriate policies (including neglect of agriculture) and weak institutions figure more prominently in the explanation of slow growth. Recent evidence, however, points to accelerated growth in many parts of Africa. Analysis of agriculture shows that adverse effects of nature can be handled effectively, that efforts to develop and apply technologies for intensification in a variety of farming systems are under way, but that sustained adoption by the mass of smallholders has not sufficiently taken place. For that to happen, a variety of time- and location-specific complementary actions — both public and private — are needed, based on a right mix of disciplinary knowledge.

While detailed regional {{accounts of the}} effects of extreme weather disasters exist, the global scale effects of droughts, floods and extreme temperature on crop production are yet to be quantified.

We show that droughts and extreme heat significantly reduced national cereal production by 9 – 10 %, whereas our analysis could not identify an effect from floods and extreme cold in the national data. Analysing the underlying processes, we find that production losses due to droughts were associated with a reduction in both harvested area and yields, whereas extreme heat mainly decreased cereal yields. Furthermore, the results highlight ~ 7 % greater production damage from more recent droughts and 8 – 11 % more damage in developed countries than in developing ones.

40|$|Based on agro-climatic conditions, the {{highland}} districts around Lake Victoria {{in western}} Kenya {{should be a}} food surplus area. In practice, they are heavily dependent on food imports, whilst national poverty surveys consistently show them to be amongst the poorest in the country. At the root of this problem are high population densities and, therefore, small land holdings, and limited access to markets. As a result of continuous cropping with very little investment in soil fertility replenishment, the soils have become severely depleted. Many poor households in these districts are now caught in a “maize-focused poverty trap”, whereby their first <b>agricultural</b> <b>priority</b> is to provide themselves with maize for home consumption, yet yields are low and returns are insufficient to support investment in either organic soil fertility enhancement technologies or inorganic fertilizers.

30|$|The low {{proportion}} of cultivated {{lands in the}} study area is most likely associated with the past robustness of the Borana social institution that prohibits cultivation in the rangelands (Angassa and Oba 2008 b). Additionally, the expansion of cultivation is a recent phenomenon in the Borana rangelands due to inappropriate development interventions and weakening of the local institution. Furthermore, the size of individual farm lands is small and less than a hectare. Such small fields are scattered in pattern and difficult to be detected by Landsat TM. Thus, such condition might also underestimate the total cover of cultivated areas in the present study. According to Coppock (1994), in the 1980 s, about 45  % of the pastoral households were involved in crop cultivation, while the average cultivated plot size per household was 0.29  ha. Angassa and Oba (2008 b) have indicated a more recent expansion of crop cultivation in the Borana rangelands with 80  % of the crop fields that were less than 20  years old. Although the total size of cultivated land area was relatively small, increased participation in crop cultivation has been observed since the last 16  years. This suggests that the Borana pastoral way of life is gradually shifting from more dependence on livestock keeping to crop cultivation in some locations. Pastoral communities are forced to involve in crop farming to meet their families’ food demand subsequent to repeated drought and massive loss of livestock, lack of land use policy, and government’s crop-focused <b>agricultural</b> <b>priority</b> via increased access to improved seed, fertilizer, and farm implements (Angassa and Oba 2008 b). The increase in cultivated land cover at the expense of grassland {{in the study area}} reflect that crop farming has undertaken mainly in bottomland areas where seasonally flooded rangelands and moisture conditions are favorable and dominated by vertisols. Bottomlands are key areas for calf grazing reserves for the dry season use (Coppock 1994). Generally, the loss of bottomland areas to crop farming may exacerbate the vulnerability of livestock especially calves to drought (Angassa and Oba 2007; Angassa 2011).|$|E
40|$|Plant {{development}} is highly plastic, allowing plants {{to adapt to}} constant changes in environmental conditions. An excellent example of developmental plasticity is shoot branching. The final architecture of the shoot system {{is determined by the}} integration of environmental cues such as light and nutrients with endogenous cues. In this thesis the effect of Nitrogen (N) availability on Arabidopsis shoot branching was used as a model to investigate plant developmental plasticity. In particular, natural variation in shoot branching response to N supply was investigated using a set of multi parent advanced generation inter cross (MAGIC) lines (Kover et al., 2009). Correlations between traits in a selected group of MAGIC lines revealed several interesting correlations, characterising two strategies for N response. One strategy involved flowering early, maintaining branch numbers of low N, and minimal shift in resource allocation to roots. This was associated with good seed yield and yield retention on low N. An alternative strategy involves late flowering, high branching on high N but low branching on low N, (i. e. high branching plasticity), and a substantial increase in root fraction on Low N. This was associated with high seed yields on high N, but poor yield retention on low N. The molecular basis for these different strategies are currently unknown, but it seems likely that plant hormones are involved. Analysis of bud activation on isolated nodal stem segments provided strong evidence that the regulation of branching by N availability requires strigolactone (SL), and that strigolactone acts by increasing the competition between buds. There was some evidence of strigolatone resistance in a low plasticity MAGIC line. Shoot system architecture is a key factor underlying crop yield, and yield stability under low N input is an <b>agricultural</b> <b>priority.</b> Therefore, in parallel the branching responses of a set of Brassica rapa lines to N limitation were determined. Results highlight many conserved features between Arabidopsis and Brassica, as well as some differences. These comparisons should aid breeding for shoot system architectures that can deliver improved yield under low N. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Equally, it should not be forgotten that agriculture is intended to satisfy food needs and that it accounts for a significant proportion of rural income. For all these reasons, agriculture is a key factor for eradicating poverty and undernourishment, the objective fixed by the first Millenium Development Goal.

This report presents an application of the Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) {{to the problem of}} identifying opportunities to enhance agriculture’s contribution to economic growth and poverty alleviation in the country. The PAM is a budget-based method that was applied to study the social and private profitability of six maize production systems and six rice production systems. The results indicate that all twelve of the systems contribute to national economic growth and private income generation among farmers, at least under the high cereals prices that prevailed in 2007. Maize systems show a higher rate of return (lower cost/benefit ratio) than rice systems. If prices returned to lower levels experienced in 2005, however, rice systems would be privately and socially unprofitable. Return to the still lower prices of 2002 would leave both the maize and rice systems unprofitable. The PAM was also used {{to assess the impact of}} alternative interventions for increasing profitability in the face of lower output prices. The results suggest that higher adoption of input technologies could make maize profitable under a very wide range of prices. However, fertilizer prices are not likely to be the constraining factor input adoption as the price of fertilizer has little impact on farm profitability given current levels of fertilizer use. Rather, further research is needed to determine how to promote improved maize production technology. For rice systems there appears to be room to enhance profitability through post-farm interventions to reduce processing losses and to improve the quality of locally grown rice. Rice systems would be profitable under very low output prices if Ghana achieved the processing conversion rates and milled rice quality found in other countries.

Results suggest that the state’s sealed-bid-offer auction, which determines the yearly conservation selections, is superior to benefit-targeting approaches frequently employed by conservation organizations, but is inferior to the optimization technique of binary linear programming that could have provided additional benefits to the state, such as 12, 000 additional acres worth an estimated $ 25 million. conservation optimization, farmland protection, analytic hierarchy process, binary linear programming, Environmental Economics and Policy, Land Economics/Use, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies,...|$|R
40|$|The rapid loss of {{biological}} diversity is a major global environmental problem. This dissertation analyzes the conservation of crop genetic diversity, a particularly important component of global biodiversity, within a framework of multi-scale linkages. It examines the impact of international institutions and regimes on national and local-level practices, {{and the implications of}} local-level practices on higher levels of social organization. To illustrate these linkages, the dissertation examines the case Turkey, the historic center of origin and modern center of diversity of several key crops, including wheat and barley. The dissertation analyzes the interplay between two different international frameworks: the biodiversity institution/regime represented by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), to which Turkey is a party, and the neoliberal economic institution/regime promoted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, whose prescriptions shape national agricultural policies through stabilization and structural adjustment programmes. ^ In line with the constructivist approach in international relations theory, the dissertation argues that the CBD has {{played a crucial role in}} providing the space and institutionalized channels for scientific input to be incorporated into the domestic policy-making process for the conservation {{of biological}} diversity. The diffusion of the policy innovations at the local level has been circumscribed significantly, however, by the <b>agricultural</b> <b>priorities</b> of the government which in turn were influenced strongly by the agricultural liberalization process directed by the IMF and assisted by the World Bank. Field research in two wheat-growing regions of Turkey reveals that the cultivation of modern and traditional varieties can co-exist, suggesting that there is no inherent contradiction between the conservation of crop genetic resources and the promotion of agricultural growth and productivity. This research also reveals the importance of social capital in the conservation of crop genetic diversity. The dissertation concludes that public agencies can play a critical role in the provision of mechanisms to ensure that conservation of crop genetic diversity will meet the needs of rural communities. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This {{paper has}} the {{objective}} of introducing a conceptual and methodological framework, as well as strategy for setting <b>agricultural</b> R&D <b>priorities</b> based on client demands, in a large public agricultural research organization in Brazil, Embrapa (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation). It {{is a result of}} a five year project aiming to develop strategy, conceptual framework and methodology for determining R&D client demands using technological demands prospective analysis in agricultural production chains (APC). Besides the strategy, conceptual framework and methodology development, the project also included results validation, training of key personnel and application of technological demands analysis in determining R&D demands in several Embrapa R&D centers. This paper also discusses results of some studies carried out on R&D demands determination and further applications of prospective analysis of production chains, in the environment of agricultural research as well as in planning of other development organizations.
