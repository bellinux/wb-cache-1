Six men entered the tent to have {{intercourse}} with the girl, after which they forced her onto her master's bed. Two men grabbed her hands, and two men her wrists. The angel of death put a rope <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> while two men pulled the rope, the old woman stabbed the girl between her ribs with a knife. Thereafter, the relatives of the dead chieftain arrived with a burning torch and set the ship aflame. It is said that the fire facilitates the voyage {{to the realm of}} the dead.|$|E

Additionally, she is described as having a third eye on her forehead and a jewel on her forehead, which is tied to a snake or a crown on the severed head. The crescent moon may also adorn her head. Chhinnamasta is depicted wearing a serpent as the sacred thread and a mundamala (garland of skulls or severed heads and bones), along with other various gold or pearl ornaments around her neck. Bangles and waist-belt ornaments may be also depicted. She may also wear a snake <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> serpentine earrings. Three streams of blood spring from her neck, one entering her own mouth, while the others are drunk by her female yogini companions, who flank her.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} Mixer {{had not been}} {{subjected}} to a sexual assault, the fact her tights had been lowered to expose her thighs and sanitary towel suggested a sexual motive behind the murder, and although the victim had not been beaten, stabbed or mutilated, her student status, the tying of a garment <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> the proximity of her abduction and murder led investigators to tentatively link her murder to those of Fleszar and Schell, despite lingering doubts she {{had been killed by}} the same perpetrator.|$|E

25|$|Ikeda drew inspirations from Kaibutsu-kun and has {{incorporated}} some references later {{into the}} first serialization of the Rosario + Vampire manga. In an interview at Lucca Comics 2012, Ikeda said he is {{a big fan of}} Tim Burton and was inspired by his works, including The Nightmare Before Christmas, and particularly Edward Scissorhands because the monster has a sensitive soul. He had also researched various monsters from encyclopedias and the Internet. He started with his passion for vampires, and the concept of a beautiful girl vampire with a crucifix <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> then created the school of monsters, Tsukune, and others afterwards. He credits the beautiful girls for the series' popularity and added the fighting elements.|$|E
25|$|Little {{physical}} evidence existed beyond eyewitness descriptions and forensic reports. Police had noted (and {{would continue to}} note) common denominators in the physical characteristics of the victims, {{and the manner in}} which they died: all of the victims had been brunette Caucasians; each (excluding Mixer) had been the recipient of extensive violence inflicted with a blunt and/or bladed instrument prior to her murder; each of the victims' bodies had been found within a 15-mile radius of Washtenaw County; and each victim (again excluding Mixer) had received knife wounds to the neck. Furthermore, each victim had been found with an item of clothing tied <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> each woman had been menstruating at the time of her death. These factors led police to publicly conclude the same perpetrator was responsible for at least three of the murders thus far committed.|$|E

It shows {{the women of the}} family adorning a young bride. The jewelry that the bride is supposed to wear at her wedding is taken from an old wooden chest that {{can be seen in the}} left-hand corner and is temporarily set against a copper tray beside her. Immediately next to the chest, a little girl holds another copper tray, which also contains several items of jewelry. Two elderly women attend to the bride. To the far right, young maidens fashion a garland of fresh flowers and joyfully whisper to one another. The room in which the women have gathered is sparsely furnished, with a low ceiling, well worn carpet and plain plastered walls. The bride wears traditional garb, with a gold necklace <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> delicately embroidered slippers on her feet. The artist's signature, Germanicized as P. Joanowitch, can be seen at the bottom right.|$|E

500|$|Madonna did {{not perform}} the song again until her Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008–09). She {{appeared}} on stage wearing a black Givenchy dress, with pink colored ribbons <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> black stockings on her legs and performed an acoustic, guitar-driven version of the song sitting on a stool. She was backed by 4 musicians who were dressed in gypsy clothes. As she performed the song, scenes from Evita played on the backdrop screens. The performance received positive feedback from critics with Ricardo Baca, from The Denver Post, writing that [...] "her courageous, late-set take on 'You Must Love Me' — from the filmed version of the Broadway musical Evita — was spot-on and gorgeous with its string accompaniment". On the Buenos Aires stop of the tour, after performing [...] "You Must Love Me", Madonna also sang [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] from the film. The performances of both songs in the city were recorded in the live CD-DVD titled, Sticky & Sweet Tour (2010). Singer Brooke White covered the song on the seventh season of American Idol. She marked Idol history that night when, after forgetting the lyrics to the song, she stopped after the first verse to start over from the beginning.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{performed}} [...] "Oh Father" [...] on her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour with [...] "Live to Tell", {{during the}} second segment of the show. As the performance of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] ended, Madonna, who {{was dressed in a}} clergyman's robe with a crucifix <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> a veil around her head, knelt on a church nave, while incense fumes wafted around her. She started singing [...] "Live to Tell" [...] from a confession bench, with Roman columns and a platform full of votive candles in the background. In the middle of the song, she started singing [...] "Oh Father" [...] while a dancer in a black frock played the role of a priest. The dancer, Carlton Wilborn, recalled that this performance required a lot of rehearsal time, since the dance portrayed Madonna as a woman trying to find her religion. He explained: [...] "One side knew she needed it, another side was resistant, and our dance represented that battle inside." [...] At the end of the performance, Wilborn pushed down Madonna's head before pulling her back up again, thus portraying his role as the priest, trying to wake up Madonna to the importance of religion. Two different performances were taped and released on video, the Blond Ambition – Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.|$|E

Her right arm and both legs were fractured, and there was a cut on her neck. She had been struck at least twelve times in the head. The autopsy of Ethan Anderson determined that the boy died because of the fire, though he also had skeletal fractures that could have been caused by events the day of the murders.|$|E

He would also install a baby monitor in the room, {{allowing him to}} listen from elsewhere in the house. The room included a private bar, and a red light outside the door warned when Rose {{was not to be}} disturbed. Rose carried the sole key to this room <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> Fred installed a separate doorbell to the household which Rose's clients were instructed to ring whenever they wished to engage in sex with her. Much of the money earned from Rose's prostitution was spent on home improvements.|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth's character, {{particularly}} {{her relationship}} to her captor, the Songbird, {{is based on}} his experience with a former female companion that Levine had; she had told Levine that her previous relationship was abusive, but she would otherwise [...] "make excuses for him , all the time" [...] and ultimately returned to him. Levine had altered this in Infinite, that while creating the abusive relation between Elizabeth and Songbird, Elizabeth desired to escape that, even if death was the only option; {{at one point in}} the game's preview material, Elizabeth is shown wrapping Booker's hands <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> convincing him to kill her while Songbird attempts to break into the building that they have secured themselves into. In response to discussions on Internet forums regarding the size and exposed nature of Elizabeth's breasts, Levine noted that part of their design for Elizabeth and her costume was to be able to recognize her from a distance given the open-space nature of the game and limited resolution. Levine stated that her costume is inspired by that of superheroes, using a simple color scheme that would help her to stand out in the colorful and complex landscapes.|$|E

2500|$|Manet {{embarked}} {{on the canvas}} after being challenged to give the Salon a nude painting to display. His uniquely frank depiction of a self-assured prostitute was accepted by the Paris Salon in 1865, where it created a scandal. According to Antonin Proust, [...] "only the precautions taken by the administration prevented the painting being punctured and torn" [...] by offended viewers. The painting was controversial partly because the nude is wearing some small items of clothing such as an orchid in her hair, a bracelet, a ribbon <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> mule slippers, all of which accentuated her nakedness, sexuality, and comfortable courtesan lifestyle. The orchid, upswept hair, black cat, and bouquet of flowers were all recognized symbols of sexuality at the time. This modern Venus' body is thin, counter to prevailing standards; the painting's lack of idealism rankled viewers. The painting's flatness, inspired by Japanese wood block art, serves to make the nude more human and less voluptuous. A fully dressed black servant is featured, exploiting the then-current theory that black people were hyper-sexed. That she is wearing the clothing of a servant to a courtesan here furthers the sexual tension of the piece.|$|E

The sculpture also acted as an architectural bracket, supporting a long sandstone beam that once ran above the yakshi's head. The Shalabhanjika Yakshi thus served two purposes: as a fertility symbol associated with the vitality of the fruit-bearing tree and as a structural element supporting the whole configuration of the gateway.|$|R

Arriving to help, they find the ship contains only one non-humanoid life form on the verge of dying. They transport the scorpion-like creature to Sickbay, and The Doctor begins to try to treat it. B'Elanna Torres, having learned of how the creature interacts with its ship, arrives to provide advice, but suddenly the creature leaps at her. It wraps itself <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> piercing <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> other vital organs, creating a physical and biochemical bond between them. The Doctor finds that attempting to pull the creature off will likely kill Torres, and seeks another solution. When he exhausts his own knowledge, he searches through the Voyager databanks and discovers information on the brilliant Cardassian exobiologist Crell Moset. The Doctor programs the holodeck to recreate Moset as to work out the solution for separating the creature from Torres together, and they develop a rapport with each other. Moset finds a method that they could separate the creature, likely killing it while leaving Torres alive, but the Doctor would rather save both patients.|$|R
