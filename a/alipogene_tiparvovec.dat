Such virus-derived vectors administered to humans elicit immune responses against the viral capsid protein and immune responses, especially cellular, mounted against the protein expressed from the administered gene have been linked to attenuated transgene expression and loss of efficacy. Therefore, a potential concern about the use of AAV-based vectors for gene-therapy is that they may induce humoral and cellular immune responses in the recipient that may impact on efficacy and safety. In this paper we review the current understanding of immune responses against AAV-based vectors and their impact on clinical efficacy and safety. In particular the immunogenicity findings from the clinical development of <b>alipogene</b> <b>tiparvovec</b> up to licensing in Europe will be discussed demonstrating that systemic and local immune responses induced by intramuscular injection of <b>alipogene</b> <b>tiparvovec</b> have no deleterious effects on clinical efficacy and safety.

The impact of such cellular immune responses on the clinical efficacy of <b>alipogene</b> <b>tiparvovec</b> (Glybera; AAV 1 -LPL(S 447 X); uniQure), a gene therapy consisting of intramuscular administration of a recombinant AAV 1 mediating muscle-directed expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), was investigated.

Systemic antibody and T cell responses against AAV 1 and LPL(S 447 X), as well as local cellular immune responses in the injected muscle, were investigated in five LPLD subjects. Long-term transgene expression was demonstrated despite a transient systemic cellular response and a stable humoral immune response against the AAV 1 capsid protein. Cellular infiltrates were found in four of the five subjects but were not associated with adverse clinical events or elevation of inflammation markers. Consistent herewith, CD 8 + T cells in the infiltrates lacked cytotoxic potential. Furthermore, FoxP 3 +/CD 4 + T cells were found in the infiltrates, suggesting that multiple mechanisms contribute to local tolerance.

40|$|Andrew E Libby, Hong Wang Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Diabetes, School of Medicine, University of Colorado at Denver, Aurora, CO, USA Abstract: Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is {{responsible}} for clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins from the blood. Deficiency or defects in this enzyme result in profound hypertriglyceridemia and susceptibility to chronic, life-threatening pancreatitis. Management of LPL deficiency has traditionally been restricted to palliative care and strategies {{to reduce the risk}} of pancreatitis, including severe dietary restrictions of fat. Recently, the European Commission approved the first gene therapy treatment in the West to treat this rare disease. <b>Alipogene</b> <b>tiparvovec</b> (Glybera®) was granted marketing authorization in November 2012 to treat LPL deficiency in a subset of patients that are at increased risk for pancreatitis. Designed as a one-time treatment, the drug uses adeno-associated virus (AAV 1) delivery of transgenic LPL to muscle in patients lacking functional enzyme. Although statistically significant reduction of serum triglycerides was initially observed in trial subjects, this effect was found to be transient, with triglyceride levels eventually rebounding to basal levels by 26 weeks in all participants. Nevertheless, despite the return of triglycerides to pretreatment levels, <b>alipogene</b> <b>tiparvovec</b> was found to have a long-term impact on postprandial chylomicron metabolism by lowering the fraction of triglyceride found in this subset of lipoproteins. Furthermore, the drug led to a clinically significant reduction in the incidence of pancreatitis in LPL-deficient patients. The regulatory approval of <b>alipogene</b> <b>tiparvovec</b> was a historic process and serves as an example of the challenges that future orphan drugs will face.

40|$|<b>Alipogene</b> <b>tiparvovec</b> (Glybera) is a {{gene therapy}} product {{approved}} in Europe under the "exceptional circumstances" pathway {{as a treatment}} for lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD), a rare genetic disease resulting in chylomicronemia and a concomitantly increased risk of acute and recurrent pancreatitis, with potentially lethal outcome. This retrospective study analyzed the frequency and severity of pancreatitis in 19 patients with LPLD up to 6 years after a single treatment with <b>alipogene</b> <b>tiparvovec.</b> An independent adjudication board of three pancreas experts, blinded to patient identification and to pre- or post-gene therapy period, performed a retrospective review of data extracted from the patients' medical records and categorized LPLD-related acute abdominal pain events requiring hospital visits and/or hospitalizations based on the adapted 2012 Atlanta diagnostic criteria for pancreatitis. Both entire disease time period data and data from an equal time period before and after gene therapy were analyzed. Events with available medical record information meeting the Atlanta diagnostic criteria were categorized as definite pancreatitis; events treated as pancreatitis but with variable levels of laboratory and imaging data were categorized as probable pancreatitis or acute abdominal pain events. A reduction of approximately 50 % was observed in all three categories of the adjudicated post-gene therapy events. Notably, no severe pancreatitis and only one intensive care unit admission was observed in the post-alipogene tiparvovec period. However, important inter- and intraindividual variations in the pre- and post-gene therapy incidence of events were observed. There was no relationship between the posttreatment incidence of events and the number of LPL gene copies injected, the administration of immunosuppressive regimen or the percent triglyceride decrease achieved at 12 weeks (primary end point in the prospective clinical studies). Although a causal relationship cannot be established and despite the limited number of individuals evaluated, results from this long-term analysis suggest that <b>alipogene</b> <b>tiparvovec</b> was associated with a lower frequency and severity of pancreatitis events, and a consequent overall reduction in health care resource use up to 6 years posttreatmen...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{potential}} of {{gene replacement therapy}} has been underscored by the market authorisation of <b>alipogene</b> <b>tiparvovec</b> (Glybera) and GSK 2696273 (Strimvelis) in the EU and recombinant adenovirus-p 53 (Gendicine) in China. Common to these systems {{is the use of}} attenuated viruses for “drug” delivery. Whilst viral delivery systems are being developed for siRNA, their application to antisense delivery remains problematic. Non-viral delivery remains experimental, with some notable successes. However, stability and the “PEG dilemma”, balancing toxicity and limited (often liver-tropic) PK-PD, with the membrane destabilising activity, necessary for nucleocytosolic access and transfection remain a problem. Areas Covered: Here we review the use of attenuated protein toxins as a delivery vehicle for nucleic acids, their relationship to the PEG-dilemma, and their biological properties with specific reference to their intracellular trafficking. Expert opinion: The possibility of using attenuated toxins as antisense and siRNA delivery systems has been demonstrated in vitro. Systems based upon attenuated anthrax toxin have been shown to have high activity (equivalent to nucleofection) and low toxicity whilst not requiring cationic “helpers” or condensing agents, divorcing these systems from the problems associated with the PEG dilemma.

Glybera was recommended for marketing authorization by the European Medicines Agency in 2012. The European Medicines Agency had only ever reviewed three marketing authorization applications for gene therapy medicinal products. Unlike {{in the case of}} Glybera, the applications of the first two products, Cerepro and Contusugene Ladenovec Gendux/Advexin, both of which were for cancer diseases, were withdrawn. In this report, we studied the European public assessment reports of the three gene therapy products. During the assessment process, Glybera was re-examined and reviewed for a fourth time. We therefore researched the re-examination procedure of the European Union regulatory process. Approximately 25 % of the new medicinal products initially given negative opinions from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use were ultimately approved after re-examination from 2009 to 2013. The indications of most medicines were changed during the re-examination procedure, and the products were later approved with a mode of approval. These results suggested that the re-examination system in the European Union contributed to the approval of both several new drugs and the first gene therapy product...|$|E
40|$|Purpose {{of review}} The present review {{summarizes}} the clinical development of adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) 1 -lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (S 447 X) gene therapy (<b>alipogene</b> <b>tiparvovec)</b> for lipoprotein lipase deficiency. Lipoprotein lipase deficiency {{is a rare}} inherited disease characterized by severe hypertriglyceridaemia, chylomicronaemia and risk of recurrent pancreatitis or other complications. AAV 1 -LPLS 447 X gene therapy {{is based on the}} rationale that by adding episomal copies of functional LPL genes into muscle cells lacking active LPL, metabolic function could be improved or restored. Recent findings AAV 1 -LPLS 447 X is a nonreplicating and nonintegrating AAV of serotype 1 designed to deliver and express the human LPL gene variant S 447 X. The clinical development programme for AAV 1 -LPLS 447 X consisted of two observational studies, three open-label interventional studies and one case note review analysis. Intramuscular administration of AAV 1 -LPLS 447 X was generally well tolerated and was associated with reduction in overall pancreatitis incidence and signs of clinical improvement up to 2 years after administration. Results of interventional studies suggest that markers of postprandial metabolism could be more accurate than fasting plasma triglyceride concentration to monitor the effect of AAV 1 -LPLS 447 X.

40|$|A good {{understanding}} of {{the natural history of}} rare genetic lipid disorders is a pre-requisite for successful patient management. Disease registries have been helpful in this regard. Lipoprotein Lipase Deficiency (LPLD) is a rare, autosomal-recessive lipid disorder characterized by severe hypertriglyceridemia and a very high risk for recurrent acute pancreatitis, however, only limited data are available on its natural course. <b>Alipogene</b> <b>tiparvovec</b> (Glybera (R)) is the first gene therapy to receive Marketing Authorization in the European Union; GENIALL (GENetherapy In the MAnagement of Lipoprotein Lipase Deficiency), a 15 -year registry focusing on LPLD was launched in 2014 as part of its Risk Management Plan. The aim of this publication is to introduce the GENIALL Registry within a structured literature review of registries in rare genetic lipid disorders. A total of 11 relevant initiatives/registries were identified (homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (hoFH) [n = 5]; LPLD [n = 1]; Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency [LALD, n = 1], detection of mutations in genetic lipid disorders [n = 4]). Besides one product registry in hoFH and the LALD registry, all other initiatives are local or country-specific. GENIALL is the first global prospective registry in LPLD that will collect physician and patient generated data on the natural course of LPLD, as well as long-term outcomes of gene therapy. Conclusion: There is a limited number of international initiatives focusing on the natural course of specific rare genetic lipid disorders. The GENIALL LPLD Registry could be the first step towards a future broader global initiative that collects data related to familial chylomicronemia syndrome and their underlying genetic causes.
