500|$|On October 13, 1951, the Leafs and the Chicago Black Hawks {{played an}} {{afternoon}} exhibition of hockey, {{prior to their}} regularly scheduled evening game, for Princess Elizabeth, the future Queen Elizabeth II, during her visit to Canada. It was captain Teeder Kennedy, representing the players, who greeted the Princess at the game. Kennedy {{said it was a}} thrilling moment and recalled thinking at the time, [...] "Here's <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>from</b> the little village of Humberstone, Ontario being presented to the Queen." [...] The 1951–52 season was dominated by Gordie Howe and the Red Wings as they finished the regular season in first and then swept third place Toronto {{in the first round of}} the playoffs and Montreal in second round without losing a single game.|$|E
500|$|Many {{people believe}} that Donen owed {{everything}} to Kelly, and Kelly biographer Clive Hirschhorn described Donen as having [...] "no particular identity or evident talent... and was just <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>from</b> the south who {{wanted to make it}} in show business." [...] Donen stated that he moved to Hollywood of his own accord; other sources state that he followed Kelly, who then helped him get his first job. Kelly would sometimes embarrass and patronize Donen in public, such as berating him {{for not being able to}} keep up with his dance steps during the rehearsals for Cover Girl. Donen has admitted that he did not consider himself to be a great performer. Despite Donen's growing resentment of Kelly, he was able to contain his feelings and professional attitude during their collaborations. Tensions between the two exploded on the set of It's Always Fair Weather. After Donen's recent hits Deep in My Heart and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers he did not want to make another film with Kelly. They fought on the set for the first time, with the now more confident Donen asserting himself. Donen almost quit the film, and his friendship with Kelly ended.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1989 NHL Entry Draft, William Houston of The Globe and Mail wrote, [...] "The best of {{the group}} is Soviet star winger Pavel Bure, a {{spectacular}} player with outstanding speed. He is compared to Vladimir Krutov and also the late Soviet superstar of the 1970s, Valeri Kharlamov." [...] NHL organizations were afraid he would not leave the Soviet Union {{to play in the}} NHL thus deterring teams from selecting him early, although scouts and analysts believed he could have been selected as high as the second round had he defected. Many analysts compared him to Valeri Khalarmov. Edmonton Oilers' scout Barry Fraser commented, [...] "From what I've seen of him, Bure can play on any team in the NHL right now... he's quick, real quick, small and very exciting. He may be the top player in this year's draft, but because he is from the Soviet Union, we don't analyze him the same way as <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>from</b> the West... I don't expect him to go really early because it is still too much of a gamble to hope he will defect." ...|$|E

500|$|Nine demos were {{recorded}} at The Mill studio in September 2003 by Paul McCartney and his touring band. A month later, in October, album sessions for Memory Almost Full began, and were produced by David Kahne and recorded at Abbey Road Studios. McCartney {{and the band}} recorded the songs [...] "You Tell Me", [...] "Only Mama Knows", [...] "Vintage Clothes", [...] "That Was Me", [...] "Feet in the Clouds", [...] "House of Wax", [...] "The End of the End", and [...] "Whole Life". However, the sessions were cut short and put on hiatus when McCartney started another album, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, with producer Nigel Godrich. In the website constructed for the album, McCartney stated: [...] "I actually started this album, Memory Almost Full, before my last album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, released September 2005. (...) When I was just finishing up everything concerned with Chaos and had just got the Grammy nominations (2006) I realised I had this album {{to go back to}} and finish off. So I got it out to listen to it again, wondering if I would enjoy it, but actually I really loved it. All I did at first was just listen to a couple of things and then I began to think, 'OK, I like that track– now, what is wrong with it?' And it might be something like a drum sound, so then I would re-drum and see where we would get to. (...) In places it's a very personal record {{and a lot of it}} is retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from being <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> <b>from</b> Liverpool and from summers gone. The album is evocative, emotional, rocking, but I can't really sum it up in one sentence".|$|E
2500|$|Unable to play {{high school}} hockey in {{southern}} California, Chelios wasn't recruited by any U.S. colleges. His only scholarship offer came from local San Diego-based United States International University, the only NCAA Division I hockey team {{west of the}} Rockies. But when Chelios arrived on campus as a freshman in 1979 he soon realized {{he was in the}} wrong environment, facing bigger players with considerably more junior hockey experience. He was eventually cut from the team and considered quitting hockey. Instead, he tried his luck in Canada, where he was twice cut by Junior B teams in Canada and hit a low point when he had to borrow money from strangers to get home to California one year. Chelios said, [...] "I wasn't any bigger or any better than the other guys, so they weren't going to take <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>from</b> the States when they could have a local guy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paxton {{decided to}} try some more {{elaborate}} recording techniques, including neo-chamber music with string sections, flutes, horns, piano, various session musicians, {{as well as his}} acoustic guitar and vocals, similar to what his labelmate Judy Collins and his friend Phil Ochs were experimenting with around this time. [...] Paxton finally broke into the album pop charts with The Things I Notice Now in the summer of 1969, and also charted with Tom Paxton 6 in the spring of the following year. [...] His song [...] "Whose Garden Was This", an environmentalist anthem written for the first Earth Day, was later recorded by John Denver and became the title track of Denver's 1970 album. [...] The diverse [...] "Baroque Folk" [...] experimentation on Paxton's recordings was basically short-lived though, and he tended to think that the music was becoming too overproduced and away from the more natural acoustic roots that he loved best. [...] Regarding this time, he said, [...] "the acoustic guitar has always been what I loved the most... I know I didn't have that rock mentality or anything. [...] I was still <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>from</b> a small town in Oklahoma. [...] And I just wanted to hear folk songs." [...] Paxton continued to sing and perform his songs on acoustic guitar at his live performances, and it wasn't too long before his albums would once again generally reflect his original traditional-sounding style.|$|E
