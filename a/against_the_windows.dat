5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} album, Room Service, significant portions of the album were produced while on tour. According to co-writer Jim Vallance modern technology and equipment made {{it a lot easier}} to record the album. Adams recorded the album while on tour, making use of the time between playing on stage and readying himself for the next gig. Vallance and Adams recorded the album normally while sitting backstage or in an hotel room with small devices which they usually carried along on tours, but especially during their off days. Adams, in an interview, mentioned that when recording a song, they needed to set up mattresses <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> and having microphones run through the toilet.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to his 1950s productions, several of Cartier's later works have also been regarded as influential. His 1962 production of Wuthering Heights was praised by Dennis Potter, then a television critic, who wrote in the Daily Herald newspaper that the production [...] "was like a thunderstorm on the flat, dreary plains of the week's television... The howl of the wind <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> the muted pain of Claire Bloom as the wretched Cathy, and the hunted misery of Keith Mitchell as Heathcliff, made this a more than adequate offering of a great work." [...] While Screenonline states that Lee Oswaldâ€”Assassin (1966) [...] "could be argued [...] of historical interest only", due to its basis in the flawed Warren Commission report, The Times praised it as being [...] "possibly the first drama-documentary".|$|E
2500|$|The Pavilion {{was opened}} at 3pm on Easter Monday, 4 April 1904. Thousands of spectators stood outside, and 300 invited persons {{squeezed}} {{into the little}} hall (now the vestibule). People pressed their faces <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> or stood in a [...] "dense mass" [...] on East Cliff, and the door was guarded by Mr Boorman the Town Beadle in [...] "sober uniform". The Pavilion was decorated with streamers, and flags including the Union Jack, the French Tricolour and the US Stars and Stripes. The Band of the Corps of the Royal Engineers was conducted by Lieutenant Summer in the bandstand on the roof. Inside the hall, flags were arranged around the walls and over Dence's memorial tablet awaiting the unveiling ceremony. The platform and its table were piled and surrounded with flowers. The band stopped, the audience stood, and the Council dignitaries processed onto the platform, headed by Chairman of the Council G. Farley JP, CC, with Mrs Dence on his arm, and guest of honour Thomas Dence who drew special applause. Proceedings were begun by a child, thus: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1905, {{during a}} {{procession}} {{to celebrate the}} visit of the Prince of Wales at Calcutta, Jatin decides to draw {{the attention of the}} future Emperor on the behaviour of HM's English officers. Not far from the royal coach, he singles out a cabriolet on a side-lane, with a group of English military men sitting on its roof, their booted legs dangling <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> seriously disturbing the livid faces of a few native ladies. [...] Stopping beside the cab, Jatin asks the fellows to leave the ladies alone. In response to their cheeky provocation, Jatin rushes up to the roof and fells them with pure Bengali slaps till they drop on the ground. The show is not innocent. Jatin is well aware that John Morley, the Secretary of State, receives regularly complaints about the English attitude towards Indian citizens, [...] "The use of rough language and pretty free use of whips and sticks, and brutalities of that sort..." [...] He will be further intimated that the Prince of Wales, [...] "on his return from the Indian tour had a long conversation with Morley [...] (...) He spoke of the ungracious bearing of Europeans to Indians." ...|$|E

60|$|A dash of rain <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> caused Rosey to {{lift her}} eyes from her book.|$|R
60|$|As if {{in reply}} a sudden {{gust of wind}} brought a volley of rain <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
60|$|With {{that final}} resolution, she rested her head <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{and waited for}} the ships to pass.|$|R
60|$|The wind howled dismally without, and {{the rain}} beat furiously <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> I crept toward him and seated myself on a low stool beside his chair.|$|E
60|$|While {{the boys}} had been at lunch the sky had darkened, and now the train rushed into a sudden heavy shower, the rain driving <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> of the car in sheets.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was quite}} well when I saw him this morning," [...] {{answered}} her brother, and they relapsed into silence, {{while the rain}} pattered <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> and the wind screamed amid {{the branches of the}} elms outside.|$|E

60|$|The {{thunder of}} the {{incoming}} waves seemed to fill the room. Even while they stood there a little shower of pebbles and spray were dashed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> Andrew looked anxiously across the estuary and tapped the barometer by his side.|$|E
6000|$|We only waited {{one minute}} with our noses glued <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> of the Trois Tigres, {{just long enough}} to see Legros extracting the leather case from the pocket of the blouse, {{just long enough to}} hear the police {{inspector}} saying peremptorily: ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the cottage}} big fires were burning, {{there were dozens}} of glasses on the table, and holly and {{mistletoe}} hanging up. The wedding party crowded in, and Tom Brangwen, becoming roisterous, poured out drinks. Everybody must drink. The bells were ringing away <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|E
60|$|I laid {{hands on}} Jimmy--the clamour above {{drowning}} speech and with Penfentenyou's aid, propped him <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> {{that he should}} see.|$|R
60|$|Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin's publichouse <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{of which}} two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.|$|R
60|$|Even as {{he spoke}} they heard the dull roar of the north wind booming across the wild empty places which lay between the Red Hall and the sea. A storm of raindrops was flung <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> <b>The</b> Princess shivered.|$|R
6000|$|They both drank their wine stolidly. The rain beat <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> sharply, {{but without}} the hollow echoes of {{the house on the}} hill. [...] "I must write to the old woman and Mamie, and say that you and me had a high old time on Christmas Eve." ...|$|E
60|$|Still {{that smell}} of hot coffee. Ever {{after it was}} {{associated}} in Armand's mind with this awful morning in the guard-house of the Rue Ste.

60|$|It was {{a gloomy}} Saturday morning. The {{trees in the}} Oaklawn grounds were tossing wildly in the gusts of wind, and sodden brown leaves were blown up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> of the library, where a score of girls {{were waiting for the}} {{principal}} to bring the mail in.|$|E
60|$|I was {{handing him}} the half-sovereign, when {{something}} came bobbing up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> and Mr. Bilder's face doubled its natural length with surprise.|$|R

60|$|SHE sat at <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{watching}} <b>the</b> evening {{invade the}} avenue. Her head was leaned <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> curtains {{and in her}} nostrils was the odour of dusty cretonne. She was tired.|$|R
60|$|But {{it was not}} this, {{but what}} she called common humanity, which {{prompted}} her, on hearing a heavy gust of rain <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> {{to go into the}} lower regions in quest of a messenger boy to order a brougham to take the guests {{home at the end of}} the evening.|$|E
60|$|The rain dashed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> The {{only other}} sound from outside was the clanging {{of the street}} cars. The girl's voice, frenzied, exhorting, almost hysterical, pealed out to the roof. At every pause, the little {{gathering}} {{of men and women}} groaned in sympathy. The man's frame was shaken with sobs.|$|E
60|$|The day wore away, {{and even}} through the {{twilight}} {{they could see the}} lone ivy leaf clinging to its stem against the wall.
