Philip Miles died in 1845, leaving Leigh Court to his eldest son, William Miles, for whom the Miles Baronetcy of Leigh Court, Somerset was created in 1859. In 1884 the second Baronet, Sir Sir Philip Miles, entertained the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII.|$|E

From this point, NY33 travels to the west and to the northeast while NY33A heads east. Less than <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> (0.4km) from its western terminus, NY33A meets Interstate490 (I-490) at exit2. In this area, I-490 straddles the border between Genesee County and Monroe County; thus, the westbound portion of the interchange is in Genesee County while the eastbound half is in Monroe County.|$|E
5|$|Coldrum Long Barrow is {{comparatively}} {{isolated from}} the other Medway Megaliths; in this it is unique, given that the other surviving examples are clustered into two groups. It is possible that another chambered tomb was located nearby; a razed, elongated earthen mound with an east–west orientation {{is located in a}} hollow {{at the foot of the}} downs just under <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> north of the Coldrum Stones. It may be that this represents the remnants of another such monument which has had its stones removed or buried. Several large sarsens south of the Coldrums might represent the remnants of a further such tomb, since destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The Russians had a {{numerical}} advantage {{but soon the}} tide swung as Drouet's Division, the 2nd of Bernadotte's I Corps, deployed on the flank of the action and allowed French cavalry to seek refuge behind their lines. The horse artillery of the Guard also inflicted heavy casualties on the Russian cavalry and fusiliers. The Russians broke and many died as they were pursued by the reinvigorated French cavalry for about <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile.</b> The casualties of the Russians in Pratzen included Kutuzov, who was severely wounded, and his son-in-law Ferdinand von Tiesenhausen who was killed.|$|E

5|$|Middlewich {{was founded}} by the Romans, who gave it the name Salinae because of its {{surrounding}} salt deposits. It {{became one of the}} major Roman sites for salt production, an activity that was centred on the township of Kinderton, about <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> north of the present-day parish church of St. Michael and All Angels. It has been suggested that pre-Roman salt production also occurred in the same area, but there is no supporting archaeological evidence. Whittaker's History of Manchester claims that the Iron Age Cornovii made Kinderton their capital, but {{it is more likely that}} the Cornovii inhabited Kinderton for its salt-making potential. There was once thought to have been a medieval castle at Kinderton, but that is now thought to have been unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Orme and La Fleche {{met again}} in the Gordon Stakes at Goodwood with two other opponents, Watercress and Royal Harry. Starting favourite, Orme had La Fleche in trouble with more than <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> still to run. He {{seemed to have the}} race won, but then veered left forcing Morny Cannon to pull him back and {{allowing}} La Fleche to draw level. However Orme pulled away again and won by a neck, with Watercress a further six lengths back in third. Orme's final race came in the Limekiln Stakes where he had to carry 10 stone. He finished second to Childwick, who was receiving 33 pounds. During the autumn Orme's legs had started to give him trouble and during the Limekiln a suspensory ligament gave way. This injury brought an end to his racing career, and he was retired to stud. Throughout his racing career he won a total of £32,528 in prize money.|$|E
5|$|Even by May 1943 Mark II ASV (Air-to-surface-vessel) {{was still}} being used. By then the German Metox {{receivers}} could detect the 1.5m radiations. A variable condenser was installed as an interim solution to reduce {{the strength of the}} signal. This gave U-boats the impression the aircraft was moving away from it. There was a radical change in 1943 with radar equipment when the ASV Mark III was becoming available. Based on RAF Bomber Command's H2S, it transmitted a much shorter wavelength of 9.1cm instead of 1.5m as with Mark Is and IIs and could not be detected by Metox receivers in U-boats. Instead of fixed aerials there was a rotary scanner, and thus the return signals gave a visual trace through 360 degrees on a CRT known as the Plan Position Indicator (PPI). The Mark II would only cover a forward arc, unlike the Mark III. The Mark III would indicate surface vessels via a dot on the screen while the coast would be given in the shape of an outline. Targets remained visible on the screen to within <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile.</b> The Mark III also suffered much less from 'sea return' obscuring targets at short range.|$|E
