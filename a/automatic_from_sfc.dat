40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundCombination {{therapy with}} an inhaled {{corticosteroid}} (ICS) and a long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA) {{in a single}} inhaler is the mainstay of asthma management and salmeterol/fluticasone combination (SFC) and fixed-dose formoterol/budesonide combination (FBC) are currently available in Japan; however, {{there is nothing to}} choose between the two. The {{purpose of this study was}} to clarify the effect of switching <b>from</b> <b>SFC</b> to FBC in patients with asthma not adequately controlled under the former treatment regimen. MethodsThis was a prospective, multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled longitudinal study in 87 adult patients with an Asthma Control Questionnaire, 5 -item version (ACQ 5) score of greater than 0. 75 under treatment with SFC 50 / 250 μg one inhalation twice daily (bid). SFC was switched to FBC 4. 5 / 160 μg two inhalations bid. Study outcomes included ACQ 5 score, peak expiratory flow (PEF), FEV 1, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) at the end of treatment period. ResultsEighty-three patients completed the study. ACQ 5 scores improved and exceeded the clinically meaningful difference after 12 weeks of treatment and well-controlled asthma (ACQ 5 score ≤ 0. 75) was attained in 37 (44. 6 %) patients. Minimum and maximum PEF and FEV 1 values improved significantly, but not FeNO values, after switching <b>from</b> <b>SFC</b> to FBC.

40|$|The Monthly TOA/Surface Averages (SRBAVG) product {{contains}} {{a month of}} space and time averaged Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) data for a single scanner instrument. The SRBAVG is also produced for combinations of scanner instruments. The monthly average regional flux is estimated using diurnal models and the 1 -degree regional fluxes at the hour of observation <b>from</b> the CERES <b>SFC</b> product. A second set of monthly average fluxes are estimated using concurrent diurnal information from geostationary satellites. These fluxes are given for both clear-sky and total-sky scenes and are spatially averaged from 1 -degree regions to 1 -degree zonal averages and a global average. For each region, the SRBAVG also contains hourly average fluxes for the month and an overall monthly average. The cloud properties <b>from</b> <b>SFC</b> are column averaged and are included on the SRBAVG.
