5|$|During the 19thcentury {{the estate}} was again {{affected}} by transport projects. In 1804 the Runcorn to Latchford Canal was opened, replacing the Mersey and Irwell Navigation; this {{cut off the}} northern part of the estate, making it only accessible by a bridge. The Grand Junction Railway was built across the estate in 1837, followed by the Warrington and Chester Railway, which opened in 1850; both of these lines affected the southeast part of the estate. In 1894, the Runcorn to Latchford Canal was replaced by the Manchester Ship Canal, and {{the northern part of}} the estate could only be accessed by a swing bridge. The Brooke family left the house in 1921, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> completely demolished in 1928. Rubble from the house was used in the foundations of a new chemical works. During the demolition, the undercroft was retained and roofed with a cap of concrete. In 1966 the current SirRichard Brooke gave Norton Priory in trust for the benefit of the public.|$|E
25|$|The ball used {{until the}} 1860s was leather around a pigs bladder <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> spherical. In 1862 rubber {{bladders}} were introduced and balls {{began to be}} manufactured with a more pronounced oval shape. In 1892 the RFU developed compulsory dimensions for {{the ball in the}} Laws of the Game for the first time. In the 1980s leather-encased balls, were replaced with balls encased in synthetic waterproof materials. In 1877 the number of players was reduced from 20 to 15 a side.|$|E
25|$|In total, 67 Jews and 9 Arabs were killed. Of the Jews killed, 59 {{died during}} the rioting and 8 more later succumbed to their wounds. They {{included}} a dozen women and three {{children under the age}} of five. Twenty-four of the victims were students from the Hebron yeshiva, seven of whom were American or Canadian. The bodies of 57 Jewish victims were buried in mass graves by Arabs, without regard to Jewish burial ritual. Most of the murdered Jews were of Ashkenazi descent, while 12 were Sephardi. 58 are thought to have been injured, including many women and children. One estimate put the figure at 49 seriously and 17 slightly wounded. A letter from the Jews of Hebron to the High Commissioner described cases of torture, mutilation and rape. Eighteen days after the massacre, the Jewish leadership requested that bodies be exhumed to ascertain whether deliberate mutilation had taken place. But after 20 bodies had been disinterred and reburied, it was decided to discontinue. The bodies had been exposed for two days before burial <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> impossible to ascertain whether or not they had been subject to mutilations after or during the massacre. No conclusions could therefore be made.|$|E

[...] Nelson's impressions were similar: [...] "It was the absolute misogyny of his crimes that stunned me," [...] she wrote, [...] "his manifest rage against women. He had no compassion at all ... he was totally engrossed in the details. His murders were his life's accomplishments." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{legend of}} the pig-faced woman was revived once more in 1865, in Sheridan Le Fanu's novel Uncle Silas. Uncle Silas {{tells the story of}} Maud Ruthyn, a wealthy heiress in her late teens who lives in a secluded house, whom a number of scheming men aim to marry to secure her money. The book {{includes}} a [...] "Bretagne ballad" [...] about the pig-faced woman, sung to Maud by her scheming governess Madame de la Rougierre as Rougierre leads her to a secret meeting with her cousin Dudley, who also has designs on her fortune. (No other record of the [...] "Bretagne ballad" [...] exists, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> certainly written by Le Fanu himself.) ...|$|E
500|$|On his {{way back}} from Rome Æthelwulf again stayed with King Charles the Bald, and may have joined him on a {{campaign}} against a Viking warband. On 1 October 856 Æthelwulf married Charles's daughter, Judith, aged 12 or 13, at Verberie. The marriage was considered extraordinary by contemporaries and by modern historians. Carolingian princesses rarely married and were usually sent to nunneries, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> unknown for them to marry foreigners. Judith was crowned queen and anointed by Hincmar, Archbishop of Rheims. Although empresses had been anointed before, {{this is the first}} definitely known anointing of a Carolingian queen. In addition West Saxon custom, described by Asser as [...] "perverse and detestable", was that the wife of a king of Wessex could not be called queen or sit on the throne with her husband– she was just the king's wife.|$|E

500|$|It {{is a very}} {{important}} film, Life, and Nothing More..., in that what was filmed was inspired by a journey I had made just three days after an earthquake. And I speak not only of the film itself but also of the experience of being in that place, where only three days before 50,000 people had died. For the survivors, {{it was as if they}} were reborn, having experienced death around them. The earthquake had happened at four or five in the morning, so in a sense everybody could have been dead <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> accidental that they hadn't died. So I didn't just see myself as a film director here, but also as an observer of people who had been condemned to death. So this was a very big influence on me, and the issue of life and death from then on does recur in my films[...]|$|E

2500|$|By Apprenticeship. This is now rare. In earlier days, someone {{wishing to}} enter such a trade would bind {{themselves}} apprentice to a Member of their chosen trade. As such, he {{was required to}} do precisely as he was instructed, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> a form of slavery - but the apprentice did learn his trade, and his Master was required to provide such training that, {{at the end of}} the apprenticeship (usually seven years) the apprentice would be sufficiently knowledgeable to become a Member - and he became a free man of the City of London - free of the obligations of apprenticeship.|$|E

2500|$|From 1968 onwards, Resnais's films {{no longer}} addressed, at least directly, big {{political}} {{issues in the}} way that a number of his previous ones had done, and his next project seemed to mark a change of direction. [...] Je t'aime, je t'aime (1968) drew upon the traditions of science-fiction for a story of a man sent back into his past, a theme which enabled Resnais again to present a narrative of fragmented time. Alain Resnais's scriptwriter on this film was the author Jacques Sternberg. The film was unlucky in its release (its planned screening at Cannes was cancelled amid the political events of May 1968), <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> five years before Resnais was able to direct another film.|$|E

[...] Since the contract insisted that the new notes be identical to the existing issue, the Dutch firm suggested that Marang take the job to Waterlow since they already had the plates <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> impossible to reproduce plates exactly. [...] On 4 December 1924, Marang approached Sir William Waterlow with a letter of introduction from the Joh. Enschedé company.

2500|$|Gordon Hall, {{also known}} as the Judge Samuel W. Dexter House, is a private house located at 8341 Island Lake Road in Dexter, Michigan. It was {{designated}} a Michigan State Historic Site in 1958 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. [...] The house is unique in Michigan for its balance, large scale, and massive hexastyle portico. [...] The structure is also significant as the dwelling of Judge Samuel W. Dexter, a pioneering Michigan resident and land baron who had a substantial impact on early development of Washtenaw County and other sections of the state. [...] The house was later owned by Dexter's granddaughter Katherine Dexter McCormick, a pioneering research scientist, suffragist, and philanthropist. [...] In its early days, Gordon Hall hosted at least two, and possibly three United States presidents, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> certainly a stop along the Underground Railroad.|$|E
2500|$|In the September 1, 1995, {{article for}} the Shambhala Sun, [...] "bell hooks talks to John Perry Barlow", Barlow {{reflects}} upon Cynthia Horner passing away: [...] "It {{seems to me that}} what we’re here to do is to learn about love in the presence of fear... You pass away from the moment into the infinite, where there are no moments and where there’s no time. Here in an embodied state, the body, like all physical things, participates in entropy and all the other artifacts of time. There’s a thin but nevertheless impermeable membrane between the chronological and the timeless that has become much more real to me since my lover died a year ago. Even though I feel her soul, the absence of her body feels like an enormous barrier. The absence of the spoken word, the absence of the sound of her voice, or the touch of her skin. All the things that only can be done by souls with bodies on them... But you know the only time that I feel in contact with her, really, is when her spirit temporarily borrows someone else’s body to dance. Like the moment that you and I were dancing up in your apartment a few months ago. And suddenly she was in you and I could feel her there. You quit dancing the way you danced and started dancing the way she danced. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> like a practical joke that she was playing in a way." ...|$|E
