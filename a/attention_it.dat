5|$|An unusual slapstick mix of film noir, black {{comedy and}} B-movie conventions, the film portrays bizarre {{situations}} involving a death row inmate. The film was a box-office flop, {{and has since}} fallen into obscurity outside of fans of Campbell and Raimi. Few critics reviewed the film, though the little amount of critical <b>attention</b> <b>it</b> received was mostly negative. Several elements of the film influenced later productions by Raimi, {{and the failure of}} Crimewave directly led to the inception of Evil Dead II (1987).

5|$|Considering {{the age and}} {{location}} of the Golubac Fortress, it is both large and well-preserved. Its placement {{at the head of}} the Iron Gate gorge allowed for easy control of river traffic. It was the last military outpost on that stretch of the Danube river, which caused it to frequently be part of the final line of defense between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, especially during the periods when Serbia was Ottoman-held. The importance of the fortress is further indicated by the <b>attention</b> <b>it</b> received from Sigismund and Murad II, rather than just fighting between locals and commanders of nearby cities. The Golubac Fortress was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by the Republic of Serbia.|$|E

The coffin, meanwhile, set off in the hearse for Liverpool. Although the funeral party changed horses only at remote and quiet coaching inns to avoid <b>attention,</b> <b>it</b> gathered followers as it progressed; by the time it reached Liverpool Town Hall late that evening, the hearse was followed by at least 10 carriages and more than 500 mourners on foot.|$|E

Nevertheless, she disliked the instant <b>attention</b> <b>it</b> drew whenever she arrived in a new place. In the fall of 1854, she added a dress a few inches longer, for occasional use. In 1855, she abandoned the dress altogether and was not involved in the formation of a National Dress Reform Association in February, 1856. Her resumption of long skirts drew the condemnation of such dress-reform leaders as Gerrit Smith and Lydia Sayer Hasbrouk, who accused her of sacrificing principle for the sake of pleasing a husband.|$|E

Bug! received positive reviews upon release; critics praised its graphics and colourful visual effects, however the game's music and voice acting were criticised.

5|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{voice of the}} curve-billed is an abrupt and brash whit-wheet, which sounds akin to a person whistling to get one's <b>attention.</b> <b>It</b> is usually uttered from high perches.

The curve-billed can utter songs consecutively two or three times, the length spanning from 2 to 15 seconds. Some phrases are nasal and buzzy; its large vocabulary enables it to conjure successive songs that are usually different from one another.|$|E

It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a pecking order can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives in a pack with other dogs.|$|E

Despite his wealth and {{extensive}} business travel, Gates usually flew coach in commercial aircraft until 1997, {{when he bought}} a private jet.

In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List.
