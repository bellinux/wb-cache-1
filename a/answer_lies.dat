25|$|Included in the Indexes, at one point, {{were many}} of the great works of Spanish literature. Also, a number of {{religious}} writers who are today considered saints by the Catholic Church saw their works appear in the Indexes. At first, this might seem counter-intuitive or even nonsensical—how were these Spanish authors published {{in the first place}} if their texts were then prohibited by the Inquisition and placed in the Index? The <b>answer</b> <b>lies</b> in the process of publication and censorship in Early Modern Spain. Books in Early Modern Spain faced prepublication licensing and approval (which could include modification) by both secular and religious authorities. However, once approved and published, the circulating text also faced the possibility of post-hoc censorship by being denounced to the Inquisition—sometimes decades later. Likewise, as Catholic theology evolved, once-prohibited texts might be removed from the Index.|$|E
25|$|How {{can this}} be {{rational}} for both investors? The <b>answer</b> <b>lies</b> {{in the fact that}} the investors do not have to invest the full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return is content to invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome by thinking that maybe tomorrow there will be new opportunities available to invest the remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. Max Value is also happy, because she has filled her capital budget straight away, and decides she can take the rest of the year off investing.|$|E

500|$|... "The Root of All Evil" [...] is {{the third}} part of Portnoy's Twelve-step Suite, a set of songs from various Dream Theater albums which {{describe}} his journey through Alcoholics Anonymous. The song contains parts six and seven of the suite: [...] "Ready" [...] and [...] "Remove". [...] "The <b>Answer</b> <b>Lies</b> Within" [...] and [...] "I Walk Beside You" [...] are the two shortest tracks on the album. Rudess regards them as radio-friendly songs which still maintain Dream Theater's style.|$|E
500|$|The {{band had}} {{previously}} written an orchestral-style {{piece in the}} form of [...] "Overture" [...] on Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, but recorded it using keyboards. The tracks [...] "The <b>Answer</b> <b>Lies</b> Within", [...] "Sacrificed Sons" [...] and [...] "Octavarium" [...] marked the first time Dream Theater worked with an orchestra, conducted by Jamshied Sharifi (who studied at Berklee College of Music {{at the same time as}} Portnoy, Petrucci and bassist John Myung). The orchestra was selected based on their sight reading ability, allowing all their parts to be recorded in a maximum of two takes, even though they had never seen or played the music before.|$|E
500|$|Octavarium was {{released}} on June 7, 2005. It was their final album with Atlantic Records, ending a contract which had lasted fourteen years. Although {{in recent years the}} band had been allowed creative freedom, they were dissatisfied by the lack of promotion the label offered them. Portnoy released a DVD entitled Drumavarium in 2005, containing footage of his drum performance from the Octavarium recording sessions. Rudess released a solo piano version of [...] "The <b>Answer</b> <b>Lies</b> Within" [...] on his 2009 album Notes on a Dream. [...] "Panic Attack" [...] is featured as a playable song in Rock Band 2, where it is listed as the hardest song for both bass and drums.|$|E

500|$|Kove's first {{ideas for}} The Danish Poet began {{when she went}} {{through a period of}} self-assessment; she wanted to write a story about what she {{described}} as when [...] "you reach a turning point or a milestone and you look back and you think 'how in the heck did I get here?' [...] And you realize that the <b>answer</b> <b>lies</b> somewhere in a complex web of all kinds of stuff, like genetic make-up, upbringing, coincidences, choices you made along the way, missed opportunities, [...] lucky breaks." [...] She felt that it was a natural choice to centre on a relationship between two people, [...] "because relationships, and especially the romantic ones, play a huge role in shaping our lives, and also, obviously, in creating new ones." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{starting}} {{to work on}} what would become Octavarium, Portnoy noted {{that it would be}} their eighth studio album and that they had recently released their fifth live album, Live at Budokan. This sequence mirrored the octave on a musical keyboard: each octave contains eight naturals and five accidentals. Portnoy suggested that they use that concept for the entire album. When writing, the band delegated each song a different key. Sound effects were placed between songs to connect them: for example, [...] "The Root of All Evil", written in F minor, and the following track, [...] "The <b>Answer</b> <b>Lies</b> Within", written in G minor, were connected by a sound effect in the key of F♯ minor. The album's lyrics and song titles featured references to this concept. Portnoy cited the titles [...] "The Root of all Evil" [...] (referring to the musical term [...] "root") and [...] "Octavarium" [...] ("the octave of the octave") as two examples of this.|$|E

That is, when can we geometrically cancel handles if this condition is true? The <b>answer</b> <b>lies</b> in carefully analyzing when the manifold remains simply-connected after removing the attaching and belt spheres in question, and finding an embedded disk using the Whitney trick. This analysis leads to the requirement that n {{must be at least}} 5. Moreover, during the proof one requires that the cobordism has no 0-,1-,n-, or (n+1)-handles which is obtained by the next technique.|$|E

2500|$|In 1964, Sedaka's {{career began}} a sharp decline, hastened by The Beatles' arrival {{on the radio}} and TV, {{and the rest of the}} {{so-called}} British Invasion. When describing the Beatles' effect on his career in the mid-1960s, Sedaka put it brusquely: [...] "The Beatles—not good!" [...] From 1964 to 1966, only three of his singles cracked the Hot 100: [...] "Sunny" [...] (No. 86, 1964), [...] "The World through a Tear" [...] (No. 76, 1965), and [...] "The Answer to My Prayer" [...] (No. 89, 1965). His other singles from this era—"The Closest Thing To Heaven", [...] "I Hope He Breaks Your Heart", [...] "Let The People Talk", [...] "The <b>Answer</b> <b>Lies</b> Within" [...] and [...] "We Can Make It If We Try"—all missed the Hot 100, the same fate since Sedaka's third U.S. single, and became commercial failures.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{pages of}} notes and commentaries {{describe}} in details various approaches to global strategies, and their limits. Such are Strategic ecosystem: beyond [...] "The Plan", Governance (a series of pages on {{reports from the}} Club of Rome, the Commission on Global Governance, and four others groups), Strategic denial: action inhibition, Post-crisis opportunities: range of strategies, and Post-crisis opportunities: strategies in chaos. A long series of pages explores how to [...] "move beyond the unimodal answer and recognize that because each form of action has both strengths and weaknesses, {{the key to a}} more effectively multimodal <b>answer</b> <b>lies</b> in finding how to interrelate the various unimodal answers so that they correct for each others weaknesses and counteract each others excesses.” But, it must also be asked, is integrated action of any type feasible at this time? The exploration begins with Strategic appropriateness: questionable answers, and finishes with Action implications: consensus, uncertainty and action formulation. Conditions for progress in strategy-making are more explicitly brought up in pages such as Strategic ecosystem: integrating constraint and opposition, and Post-crisis opportunities: in quest of radical coherence.|$|E

60|$|Another {{and more}} {{important}} result may be deduced from my observations. Eggs and seeds are highly serviceable {{as a means of}} dissemination, but we now know that fertile eggs can be produced without the aid of the male. There are also many other methods by which organisms can be propagated asexually. Why then have the two sexes been developed, and why do males exist which cannot themselves produce offspring? The <b>answer</b> <b>lies,</b> as I can hardly doubt, in the great good which is derived from the fusion of two somewhat differentiated individuals; and {{with the exception of the}} lowest organisms this is possible only by means of the sexual elements, these consisting of cells separated from the body, containing the germs of every part, and capable of being fused completely together.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Methuen's {{statement}} differs, {{as will be}} seen, very widely from Mr. Stead's; for Mr. Stead says Mafeking, and Mr. Methuen says {{north of}} Mafeking. There was a very great deal of fighting at Mafeking, and comparatively little north of Mafeking during that time, so that the difference is an essential one. To test Mr. Stead's assertion about Mafeking, I communicated with General Baden-Powell, the gentleman who is most qualified to speak as to what occurred there, and his <b>answer</b> <b>lies</b> before me: 'We had no expanding bullets in our supply at Mafeking, unless you call the ordinary Martini-Henry an expanding bullet. I would not have used them on humane principles, and moreover, an Army order had been issued {{against the use of}} dum-dum bullets in this campaign. On the other hand, explosive bullets are expressly forbidden in the Convention, and these the Boers used freely against us in Mafeking, especially on May 12.' ...|$|E
6000|$|This sort {{of thing}} {{is not to be}} defended in Browning any more than in Swinburne. But, on the other hand, it is not to be {{attributed}} in Swinburne to a momentary exaggeration, and in Browning to a vital æsthetic deficiency. In the case of Swinburne, we all feel that {{the question is not whether}} that particular preposterous couplet about lilies and roses redounds to the credit of the Swinburnian style, but whether it would be possible in any other style than the Swinburnian to have written the Hymn to Proserpine. In the same way, the essential issue about Browning as an artist is not whether he, in common with Byron, Wordsworth, Shelley, Tennyson, and Swinburne, sometimes wrote bad poetry, but whether in any other style except Browning's you could have achieved the precise artistic effect which is achieved by such incomparable lyrics as [...] "The Patriot" [...] or [...] "The Laboratory." [...] The answer must be in the negative, and in that <b>answer</b> <b>lies</b> the whole justification of Browning as an artist.|$|E

60|$|One other detail: On {{the left}} side of the skirt of the black dress was, as I thought at first, a shapeless bunch of white ribbon. Then, as I looked more intently or as the vision defined itself more clearly, I {{perceived}} what it was. It was the hand of a man, clenched and knotted in agony, which held on with a convulsive grasp to the fold of the dress. The rest of the crouching figure was a mere vague outline, but that strenuous hand shone clear on the dark background, with a sinister suggestion of tragedy in its frantic clutch. The man is frightened--horribly frightened. That I can clearly discern. What has terrified him so? Why does he grip the woman's dress? The <b>answer</b> <b>lies</b> amongst those moving figures in the background. They have brought danger both to him and to her. The interest of the thing fascinated me. I thought no more of its relation to my own nerves. I stared and stared as if in a theatre. But I could get no further. The mist thinned. There were tumultuous movements in which all the figures were vaguely concerned. Then the mirror was clear once more.|$|E

The <b>answer</b> <b>lies</b> around, written in all colors and motions, uttered in all tones of jubilee and wail, in thousand-figured, thousand-voiced, {{harmonious}} Nature: but where is the cunning eye and ear to whom that God-written Apocalypse will yield articulate meaning? We sit as in a boundless Phantasmagoria and Dream-grotto; boundless, for the faintest star, the remotest century, lies not even nearer the verge thereof: sounds and many-colored visions flit round our sense; but Him, the Unslumbering, whose work both Dream and Dreamer are, we see not; except in rare half-waking moments, suspect not. Creation, says one, lies before us, like a glorious Rainbow; but the Sun that made it lies behind us, hidden from us. Then, in that strange Dream, how we clutch at shadows {{as if they were}} substances; and sleep deepest while fancying ourselves most awake! Which of your Philosophical Systems is other than a dream-theorem; a net quotient, confidently given out, where divisor and dividend are both unknown? What are all your national Wars, with their Moscow Retreats, and sanguinary hate-filled Revolutions, but the Somnambulism of uneasy Sleepers?

60|$|But {{if that is}} so, {{you will}} ask, {{why is it that}} they have not made more {{impression}} upon the enemy's position? The <b>answer</b> <b>lies</b> in the strategical position of Italy, and it can be discussed without any technicalities. A child could understand it. The Alps form such a bar across the north that there are only two points where serious operations are possible. One is the Trentino Salient where Austria can always threaten and invade Italy. She lies in the mountains with the plains beneath her. She can always invade the plain, but the Italians cannot seriously invade the mountains, since the passes would only lead to other mountains beyond. Therefore their only possible policy is to hold the Austrians back. This they have most successfully done, and though the Austrians {{with the aid of a}} shattering heavy artillery have recently made some advance, it is perfectly certain that they can never really carry out any serious invasion. The Italians then have done all that could be done in this quarter. There remains the other front, the opening by the sea. Here the Italians had a chance to advance over a front of plain bounded by a river with hills beyond. They cleared the plain, they crossed the river, they fought a battle very like our own battle of the Aisne upon the slopes of the hills, taking 20,000 Austrian prisoners, and now they are faced by barbed wire, machine guns, cemented trenches, and every other device which has held them as it has held every one else. But remember what they have done for the common cause and be grateful for it. They have in a year occupied some forty Austrian divisions, and relieved our Russian allies to that very appreciable extent. They have killed or wounded a quarter of a million, taken 40,000, and drawn to themselves a large portion of the artillery. That is their record up to date. As to the future it is very easy to prophesy. They will continue to absorb large enemy armies. Neither side can advance far as matters stand. But if the Russians advance and Austria has to draw her men to the East, there will be a tiger spring for Trieste. If manhood can break the line, then I believe the Durandos will do it.|$|E
