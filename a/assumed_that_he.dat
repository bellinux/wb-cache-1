5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Æthelhard's family {{background}} or early life, however it is <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was a native of}} Mercia. He first appears in the historical record as abbot of a monastery at Louth, Lincolnshire before being named to the diocese of Winchester. He was consecrated Bishop of Winchester sometime after 759 and before 778.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{historian}} Rafał Jaworski {{states that}} the estimates {{of the size of}} Bolesław's army range between 2,000–5,000 Polish warriors, in addition to Thietmar's reported 1,000Pechenegs, 300German knights, and 500Hungarian mercenaries. Less is known about Yaroslav's army, but it is <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> managed to collect a force of similar size. It is also believed that he was aware of Bolesław's intentions and had time to make defensive preparations.|$|E
5|$|The {{family name}} of Harclay derives from Hartley in Westmorland. Though {{relatively}} {{little is known}} about his early years, Andrew Harclay was probably the eldest son of Sir Michael Harclay and Joan, daughter of the Yorkshire landowner William Fitzjohn. His younger brother was the theologian Henry Harclay, a Chancellor of the University of Oxford. Michael Harclay was a retainer of the Clifford family, and served as sheriff of Cumberland from 1285 to 1296. The first documented appearance of Andrew Harclay was at a Westmorland eyre in 1292, at which point it must be <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was at least twenty-one years old, and therefore born in the early 1270s.|$|E

5|$|The text of {{the short}} work was written by Georg Christian Lehms, for two arias and a {{connecting}} recitative. The topic is to resist sin, based on the Epistle of James. The text was published in a 1711 collection, dedicated to the Sunday Oculi. It is not known when Bach composed the work but is <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> performed {{it as part of}} his monthly cantata productions in 1714 on the seventh Sunday after Trinity, 15 July. The solo voice is accompanied by strings: two violin parts, two viola parts and continuo. The composition begins with a striking dissonant chord.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s Abd al-Rahman was a {{respected}} {{religious and political}} leader. In 1921 he held a meeting at his home where the attendees signed two documents that laid out the Mahdist objectives. These were for Sudan to be ruled by Britain rather than Egypt, and for Sudan to eventually achieve self-government. In the early 1920s, between 5,000 and 15,000 pilgrims were coming to Aba Island each year to celebrate Ramadan. Many of them identified Abd al-Rahman with Isa, the prophet Jesus, and <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would drive the Christian colonists out of Sudan. The British found that Abd al-Rahman was in correspondence with agents and leaders in Nigeria and Cameroon, predicting the eventual victory of the Mahdists over the Christians. They blamed him for unrest in these colonies. After pilgrims from West Africa held mass demonstrations on Aba Island in 1924, Abd al-Rahman was told {{to put a stop}} to the pilgrimages.|$|E
5|$|Davidson's family <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would follow}} {{his father in}} {{becoming}} a priest and he was brought up strictly. When he was six he began attending Banister Court School in Southampton, an establishment founded initially for the sons of Merchant Navy officers. In 1890 Harold was sent to live with two maiden aunts in Croydon while he attended the Whitgift School. Here he became an enthusiastic amateur actor, encouraged by his friendship with a fellow-pupil, Leon Quartermaine, who later won recognition {{on the stage and}} in films. In February 1894 the pair appeared together in a school production of the farce Sent to the Tower. Under his aunts' influence, Davidson became a part-time worker at Toynbee Hall, an East End charity founded by Samuel and Henrietta Barnett which attracted many volunteers from schools and universities. Because of these distractions he neglected his school work and failed to win a scholarship that would enable him to attend Oxford University and study for holy orders. In the face of his father's disapproval, he decided to pursue a career as a stage comedian.|$|E

5|$|Foliot {{accompanied}} Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, to a papal council at Reims in 1148. During {{his time}} {{there he was}} appointed to the Diocese of Hereford by Pope Eugene III. Despite a promise made in Reims not to recognise Stephen, Foliot on his return to England nevertheless swore fealty to the king, causing a temporary rift in his relationship with Henry of Anjou, Matilda's son, who eventually became King Henry II of England in 1154. When Theobald died in 1160, it was widely <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be replaced by Foliot, but King Henry nominated his Chancellor, Thomas Becket, instead. Foliot later claimed to have opposed this appointment, and supported Henry during the king's dispute with the new archbishop. Foliot was translated, or moved, to the Diocese of London in 1163, perhaps as consolation for not receiving Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{maintained}} {{peace with}} Scotland during his reign, {{where he was}} the feudal lord of Alexander II. Henry <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had the right to interfere in Scottish affairs and brought up the issue of his authority with the Scottish kings at key moments, but he lacked the inclination or the resources to do much more. Alexander had occupied parts of northern England during the First Barons' War but had been excommunicated and forced to retreat. Alexander married Henry's sister Joan in 1221, and after he and Henry signed the Treaty of York in 1237, Henry had a secure northern frontier. Henry knighted Alexander III before the young King married Henry's daughter Margaret in 1251 and, despite Alexander's refusal to give homage to Henry for Scotland, the two enjoyed a good relationship. Henry had Alexander and Margaret rescued from Edinburgh Castle when they were imprisoned there by a rebellious Scottish baron in 1255 and took additional measures to manage Alexander's government during the rest of his minority years.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Manning {{left the}} family in 1869 after selling most of the family's realty to his wife. There is no {{evidence}} that suggests that Isaac had any permanent relations with any members of the family again. Within four years James was remarried to her son Sylvester's father-in-law, Frank Perkins. The marriage lasted less than two years, after which time she reverted to her former married name. It was at this time that James became increasingly worried about her eternal welfare. She began to petition the First Presidency to be endowed and to be sealed, along with her children, to Walker Lewis, a prominent African-American Mormon Elder. Lewis, like Elijah Abel, had been ordained to the priesthood during Joseph Smith's lifetime, and James therefore <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be eligible for temple ordinances. However, her petitions were consistently ignored or refused.|$|E

5|$|On 3 November 1943, Brändle {{shot down}} two P-47 Thunderbolts fighters escorting a {{formation}} of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses {{on a mission}} targeting Wilhelmshaven. Later that day, {{he was killed in}} action west of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Following an attack by a group of Martin B-26 Marauders on Schiphol airfield, II. Gruppe scrambled to counter the attack. It is <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was shot down in his Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-6 (Werknummer 26058—factory number) by Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) fighters under the command of Wing Commander Lloyd Chadburn. His body was later washed ashore near Zandvoort on 30 December 1943 and was buried at the Heroes Cemetery in Amsterdam (field 74, grave 405) one day later. His remains were moved in January 1944 before they were reinterred for a last time on 2 December 1947, this time at the cemetery Ysselsteyn (block CW, row 1, grave 25).|$|E
5|$|The series follows Peter Kingdom, {{a small-town}} {{solicitor}} whose work revolves around cases {{brought by the}} eclectic and eccentric populace of Market Shipborough. The series retains a largely episodic format, where self-contained plots play out before the hour concludes, though a continuing storyline concerns the mysterious disappearance of Simon Kingdom, Peter's half-brother. The first episode reveals that he vanished at sea six months previously and that everybody who knew him (including Peter) <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> committed suicide. Each week there are further indications {{that he did not}} die, culminating in episode six when it is revealed that he had a relationship with a woman, and that she had become pregnant with his child after he had supposedly died. In the first series we are also introduced to Peter's half-sister, Beatrice, who slowly becomes an integral character in the series.|$|E
5|$|When Peng's grand-uncle died in 1911, Peng {{left home}} {{and worked at}} a coalmine in Xiangtan, where he pushed carts of coal for {{thirteen}} {{hours a day for}} a wage of nine yuan a month. In 1912, shortly after the founding of the Republic of China, the mine went bankrupt and the owners fled, cheating Peng out of half his annual wages. Peng returned home in 1912 and took a number of odd jobs. In 1913 Hunan suffered another drought, and Peng participated in a public demonstration that escalated into the seizure of a grain merchant's storehouse, and the redistribution of grain among the peasants. Village police issued a warrant for Peng's arrest, and he fled to northern Hunan, where he worked for two years as a construction laborer {{for the construction of a}} dam near Dongting Lake. When the dam was completed, in 1916, Peng <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was no longer in danger of being arrested and returned home, joining the army of a local Kuomintang-aligned warlord, Tang Xiangming.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of Piers Gaveston's early years; even his year of birth is unknown. He and Prince Edward of Caernarfon (born 25 April 1284) {{were said to be}} contemporaries (coetanei), so it can be <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was born in or around 1284. Though one chronicle claims he {{accompanied}} his father to England in 1297, the first reliable reference to him is from Gascony later that year, when he served in the company of Edward I. In 1300 he sailed to England with his father and his older brother, Arnaud-Guillaume de Marsan. It was at this time that he {{became a member of the}} household of the young Prince Edward – the future Edward II. The King was apparently impressed by Gaveston's conduct and martial skills, and wanted him to serve as a model for his son. In 1304, the King awarded Gaveston the wardship of Roger Mortimer of Wigmore, after the death of Roger's father, on the request of Edward, Prince of Wales. This put Gaveston in charge of Mortimer's possessions during the latter's minority, and served as proof of the King's confidence in his son's companion.|$|E

25|$|Payment {{records for}} Morton end in 1476, {{and it was}} long <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died then; however more recent {{evidence}} from the Vatican archive shows that he was alive as late as 1479, since he resigned a Dutch parish then.|$|E
25|$|In 1827 his mistress, Louisa Cauty, {{died after}} {{poisoning}} herself with arsenic.
