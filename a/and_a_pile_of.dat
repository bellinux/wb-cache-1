There is also {{the symbol of the}} recreation centre and an old theatre featured in the mural.|$|E

The muntz metal outline that {{originally}} clad {{the outside of the}} hull <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> basalt which was the final cargo of blue metal from Kiama are all that was visible. The bow can still be made out (basically pointing to the harbour bridge) and some concreted near here which is most likely anchor chain.|$|E

25|$|In {{that year}} Captain Wing {{anchored}} the Deborah {{in the bay}} now bearing its name where he was joined by Frederick Tuckett who selected an adjoining block of land (the Otago Block) as {{the site for the}} Scottish New Edinburgh settlement. He nominated Koputai as its deep water port to be called 'Port Chalmers' after the Presbyterian Free Church leader Thomas Chalmers. The sale of the Otago Block from Māori to the Otago Association was concluded at Port Chalmers 31 July 1844. Already, by June 9, there were two whares, Māori-style houses, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> bricks waiting to be turned into Tuckett's house. Mr. and Mrs. Lethbridge were in residence, David Scott and several others. In December 1844 Alexander McKay and his wife arrived to open the first public house, the 'Surveyors' Arms'. The town was surveyed by Charles Kettle in 1846 and a Town Board was formed in that year. The first ships of Otago Association settlers, the John Wickliffe and the Philip Laing, anchored at Port Chalmers in March and April 1848.|$|E
500|$|Cumming {{became an}} early victim of {{identity}} theft on 27 March 1888 {{when a man}} impersonating him stole goods worth 100,000 francs (equivalent to approximately £ in current terms) from a Nice jewellery shop. The thief had identified himself to the shop's owner, Mr Boxta, as [...] "Admiral Sir Arthur Cumming" [...] and presented a card in that name with Cumming's coat of arms printed on it. [...] Having made a small purchase the thief requested that Boxta bring a large quantity of diamond rings, bracelets and a necklace to his rooms {{so that he could}} choose a present for his wife. [...] Boxta was reassured by the high status neighbourhood <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> Bank of England notes that the thief showed him and allowed the thief to take the jewellery to an adjacent room from which he was able to escape. [...] The thief was never caught.|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{crossing}} into Franklin County, [...] {{the town}} of Phil Campbell experienced significant devastation of the same magnitude as Hackleburg. Numerous homes, {{some of which were}} well-constructed, were swept away as the tornado tore through town. At least three churches along the path sustained significant damage, with one church in the town being completely destroyed and having only the foundation slab remaining. Multiple mobile homes throughout the path were completely destroyed, and their mangled frames were tossed at least [...] Cars were tossed and destroyed throughout the path of the tornado, with one car wrapped around a debarked tree. A [...] section of pavement was torn from a road in this area as well. The most intense damage along the path occurred northeast of Phil Campbell in the rural community of Oak Grove, where vehicles were carried long distances and mangled beyond recognition, large trees were completely debarked, and large brick homes with extensive anchoring were obliterated with the debris wind-rowed hundreds of yards away. The tornado continued into Lawrence County, impacting the Mount Hope community, where significant devastation was incurred to single-family homes and a restaurant. Nothing but the foundation <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> debris remained at the restaurant site, and {{a small portion of the}} restaurant's foundation slab buckled.|$|E

5000|$|One 19th-century visitor was unimpressed by the cathedral's appearance: [...] "The {{attempt at}} a tower is conspicuously mean <b>and</b> hideous. <b>A</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> emigrants' luggage with a {{rabbit-hutch}} or bird-cage overhead would look equally imposing".|$|R
6000|$|... "Here it goes, then," [...] and Nelly began {{bundling}} {{everything out}} in such haste that she broke two flower-pots, scattered all the squash-seeds, <b>and</b> brought <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> rakes <b>and</b> hoes clattering down about her ears.|$|R
500|$|The episode's {{concluding}} scene involving Sophia's {{death was}} {{cited as the}} episode highlight. Janet Turley of The Huffington Post asserted that the sequence was [...] "fiction not afraid to provoke", while Goldman described it as an [...] "absolutely horrific scenario". CNN's Henry Hanks opined that the sequence [...] "left [...] with a final scene that we'll be talking about until then." [...] New York City Starlee Kine asserted that it contained cinematic qualities, and felt that the scene was [...] "satisfying, sad, and fun". She wrote: [...] "It was everything you've ever wanted this show to be. Zombies plus no dialogue, such a winning combination! And how great was it that Sophia was dead instead of impossibly alive somewhere, holed up with Merle or Morgan or those warmhearted gang members in Atlanta. And because she was granted more screen time than she ever was when she was alive, we were finally able {{to care about the}} loss of her short, young life." [...] Jen Chaney of The Washington Post echoed synonymous sentiments; [...] "Really, the final moments of the last episode before the AMC series' December/January hiatus played like a fireworks finale on the Fourth of July, assuming your Fourth of July celebrations typically involve zombies <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> corpses." [...] Rawlings concluded that it was the perfect resolution for what he called [...] "television's slowest subplot". McIntyre felt that the concluding sequence was the most eventful moment of the episode, and stated that it was difficult to watch.|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} about {{a little boy who}} leaves his home with his dog to shop for food items for his mother, and {{attempts}} to remember the list of things she wanted him to buy. [...] The original request from his mother is [...] "six farm eggs, a cake for tea, a pound of pears, and don't forget the bacon." [...] Along with the dog, he is accompanied on his trip by a butterfly. In order to avoid forgetting items, the boy recites his mother's list to himself. Throughout his trip to the store, the boy sees items along the way that play tricks with his memory, and items on his list one-by-one become substituted with other goods. [...] "Six farm eggs" [...] initially becomes [...] "Six fat legs" [...] then [...] "Six clothes pegs", and [...] "A cake for tea" [...] initially becomes [...] "A cape for me" [...] then [...] "A rake for leaves", and [...] "A pound of pears" [...] initially becomes [...] "A flight of stairs" [...] then [...] "A pile of chairs". By the end of his trip, the boy has forgotten the initial items requested, and supplants them in his mind with [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, a pile of chairs, and don't forget the bacon". Then he goes to the junk shop and says to a merchant there, [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> chairs please!". The merchant in the junk shop assists the boy in compiling to this odd list. While travelling back to his home, he remembers the original items and corrects his mistakes. Then on the way home, he says to himself, [...] "Six farm eggs, a cake for tea, and a pound of pears". However, he still forgets to acquire bacon when he gets home. And finally, he says, [...] "I FORGOT THE BACON!". Finally, the final panel depicts the child carrying a basket and a coin purse, taking his dog attached to a leash, and do an en route; probably to purchase the bacon which he forgot.|$|E

She says that her mother used to hear voices, and that the next and last date in the document, October 19, was the day Lucinda always said Diana would die.
