5|$|A {{long-lived}} fish, adult Murray cod are carnivorous and mainly eat other fish. The species {{exhibits a}} high degree of parental care for their eggs, which are spawned in the spring and are generally laid in hollow logs or on other hard surfaces. Murray cod are a popular angling target and <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species.</b> Often available through the aquarium trade, they are also a popular aquarium species in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Due to the King George whitings’ {{popularity}} {{as a food}} fish, extensive {{investigations into}} {{the viability of the}} species as an <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> have occurred, with most initial investigations indicating the long larval cycle is a major barrier to the successful farming of the fish. Other problems have arisen in a parasite previously unknown in the species only affecting the fish in captivity. Thyroid growth hormones may be used in the future to hasten growth of larvae and make such ventures more feasible.|$|E
2500|$|Kelp forests {{have been}} {{important}} to human existence for thousands of years. Indeed, many now theorise that the first colonisation of the Americas was due to fishing communities following the Pacific kelp forests during the last ice age. One theory contends that the kelp forests that would have stretched from northeast Asia to the American Pacific coast would have provided many benefits to ancient boaters. The kelp forests would have provided many sustenance opportunities, as well as acting {{as a type of}} buffer from rough water. Besides these benefits, researchers believe that the kelp forests might have helped early boaters navigate, acting as a type of [...] "kelp highway". Theorists also suggest that the kelp forests would have helped these ancient colonists by providing a stable way of life and preventing them from having to adapt to new ecosystems and develop new survival methods even as they traveled thousands of miles. [...] Modern economies are based on fisheries of kelp-associated species such as [...] lobster and rockfish. Humans can also harvest kelp directly to feed <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> such as [...] abalone and to extract the compound alginic acid, which is used in products like toothpaste and antacids. Kelp forests are valued for recreational activities such as SCUBA diving and kayaking; the industries that support these sports represent one benefit related to the ecosystem and the enjoyment derived from these activities represents another. All of these are examples of ecosystem services provided specifically by kelp forests.|$|E

Ecuador is an excellent producer of <b>aquacultures</b> <b>species,</b> this has allowed that one of the products most desired by the foreign countries and principal for the United States is the Tilapia, the same one that is exported. Positioning Ecuador as the second world supplier of fresh filet in this type of market.

50|$|An {{important}} part {{of research at the}} Leigh Marine Laboratory is supporting the development of aquaculture in New Zealand. There is a strong focus on the development of new <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species,</b> including spiny lobsters, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, and various fin fish species. In addition, research is undertaken on improving the production and sustainability of existing important <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species,</b> such as abalone, mussels and oysters.|$|E

50|$|Raising {{the common}} {{periwinkle}} {{has not been}} a focus due to its abundance in nature and relatively low price, however there are potential benefits from <b>aquaculturing</b> this <b>species,</b> including a more controlled environment, easier harvesting, less damages from predators, as well as saving the natural population from commercial harvesting.|$|R
50|$|<b>Aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> are reared for {{particular}} traits such as growth rate, survival rate, meat quality, resistance to diseases, age at sexual maturation, fecundity, shell traits like shell size, shell colour, etc.|$|E
50|$|Age at sexual {{maturation}} - The age of maturity in <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> is another very important attribute for farmers as during early maturation the species divert all their energy to gonad production affecting growth and meat production {{and are more}} susceptible to health problems (Gjerde 1986).|$|E

30|$|There is an {{increasing}} pressure on tropical species of the freshwater eel genus Anguilla for use in <b>aquaculture,</b> so <b>species</b> identification methods are needed to monitor these activities and to facilitate conservation efforts.

50|$|Currently, the {{sea cage}} trials and tank trials are base-lining the {{performance}} for hāpuku. These early on-growing trials and results are revealing considerable growth potential in <b>aquaculture</b> for this <b>species.</b>|$|R
50|$|Growth rate - {{growth rate}} is {{normally}} measured as either body weight or body length. This trait {{is of great}} economic importance for all <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> as faster growth rate speeds up the turnover of production. Improved growth rates show that farmed animals utilize their feed more efficiently through a correlated response.|$|E
50|$|The farms {{generally}} {{have their own}} hatchery and the whole operation involves hatching, growing, harvesting and processing in an integrated continual process operation. Unlike most <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species,</b> prawns feed at night, which means that feeding must be performed during the evening or early morning hours. Operational hours extend from 2:30 am through to 11 pm.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} also a {{potential}} <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> in Australia. There is already a well established export of wild rock lobster from Australia, especially Southern Australia which currently lands just over 3000 tonnes a year. An aquaculture of this species would serve to bulk up the wild catch and add value with high quality grown lobsters.|$|E

50|$|Broodstock {{managers}} can use or select for traits such as fast growth rates or disease resistance over generations {{to produce more}} desirable fish. This ability for genetic improvement of stocks is more efficient and produces higher value stock. Broodstocks also enable you to selectively plan and control all matings. Selective breeding {{is an important part}} of the domestication of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
50|$|Selective {{breeding}} in aquaculture provide remarkable {{economic benefits}} to the industry, the primary one being that it reduces production costs due to faster turnover rates. This is because of faster growth rates, decreased maintenance rates, increased energy and protein retention, and better feed efficiency. Applying such genetic improvement program to <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> will increase productivity to meet the increasing demands of growing populations.|$|E
50|$|The {{demand for}} M. pyrifera is {{increasing}} {{due to the}} newfound uses of these plants such as fertilizers, cultivation for bioremediation purposes, abalone and sea urchin feed. There is current research going into utilizing M. pyrifera as feed for other <b>aquaculture</b> <b>species</b> such as shrimps. Recently, M. pyrifera has been examined as a possible feedstock for conversion into ethanol for biofuel use.|$|E
25|$|In Taiwanese waters, blacktip sawtail {{catsharks}} of most {{sizes are}} frequently caught incidentally in bottom trawls operated by commercial shrimp fisheries. Captured sharks are processed into fishmeal {{and used in}} <b>aquaculture.</b> This <b>species</b> is probably also caught incidentally by bottom trawlers in the Philippines, {{as it has been}} observed at markets. Because specific catch data is lacking, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the blacktip sawtail catshark as Data Deficient.|$|R

30|$|Common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) is an {{important}} <b>aquaculture</b> fish <b>species</b> worldwide, but many bacterial and viral infections have recently become a big problem in common carp aquaculture industry. A {{better understanding of the}} innate immune response in common carp against bacteria and virus is critical for the sustainable growth of the industry. In the innate immunity, the recognition of bacteria or virus by host cells is mediated by multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). Among these PRRs, TLRs could recognize both bacteria and virus (Zhang and Gui 2012; Zhang et al. 2014).|$|R
