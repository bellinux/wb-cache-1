5|$|The Vaishnava {{movement}} in the Kannada-speaking regions found momentum after {{the arrival of the}} philosopher Ramanujacharya (1017–1137). Fleeing possible persecution from the Chola King (who was a Shaiva), Ramanujacharya sought refuge initially in Tondanur and later moved to Melkote. But this event had no impact on Vaishnava literature in Hoysala lands at that time. However, the teachings of Madhvacharya (1238–1317), propounder of the Dvaita philosophy, did have <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> Vaishnava literature, in both the Sanskrit and Kannada languages. This body of writings is known as haridasa sahitya (haridasa literature).|$|E
5|$|The fan {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the different models of the CFM56, and that change has <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates {{at the same speed}} for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the fan blades. The lower speed allows the fan blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park and the {{surrounding}} region host over 1,000 species of vascular plants. With an altitude variance of over , the park {{has a number of}} different ecological zones including alpine tundra, the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone where spruce-fir forests are dominant, and the valley floor, where a mixed conifer and deciduous forest zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with sagebrush plains atop alluvial deposits. Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, wildfire incidence, avalanches and human activities have <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the types of plant species in an immediate area.

5|$|The 2003 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{was the first}} season to feature no major hurricanes – storms of Category 3 intensity or higher – since 1977. It produced an unusually large number of tropical cyclones which affected Mexico. The most notable cyclones during the year were Hurricanes Ignacio and Marty, which killed 2 and 12people in Mexico, respectively, and were collectively responsible for about US$1billion (2003 USD) in damage. Three other Pacific storms, two of which were hurricanes, and three Atlantic storms also had <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> Mexico. The only other significant storm of the season was Hurricane Jimena, which passed just {{to the south of}} Hawaii, the first storm to directly threaten Hawaii for several years.|$|E

25|$|Unbalanced {{demographics}} and lopsided Employment-to-population ratio {{has resulted in}} extension of the retirement age, applied budgetary pressure on social security & welfare service systems (medicare, pensions), and accelerated rural depopulation. Increasing skill-erosion of the employable workforce due to technology evolutions is impacting all segments of value-addition. Stiff competition for market-access and ever-growing difficulties to retain market-shares in the global arena is impacting businesses {{who are unable to}} afford the sustained capital investment requirements for continuous product development, quicker time-to-market and superior customer management. Constraints linked to continuous skills-development and latencies in transforming legacy processes, technologies and infrastructure have had <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> employment and market opportunities.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{personality}} {{research has}} been done that links positive emotional states to individual differences in risky behaviour. The trait positive urgency, defined as the tendency to engage in risky behaviour under conditions of extreme positive affect, is predictive of substance or behavioural problems that lead to addiction. This trait represents an underlying dysregulation in response to extreme affective states and has <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> behaviour. The trait 'positive urgency' has been shown to have a predictive relationship with increases in drinking quantity and alcohol-related problems in college, as well as drug use in college. Furthermore, this trait provides important information on how positive affect can increase the likelihood of engaging in substance abuse.|$|E

25|$|These {{new forms}} of {{monetary}} interdependence made possible huge capital flows. During the Bretton Woods era, countries were reluctant to alter exchange rates formally even in cases of structural disequilibria. Because such changes had <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> certain domestic economic groups, they {{came to be seen}} as political risks for leaders. As a result, official exchange rates often became unrealistic in market terms, providing a virtually risk-free temptation for speculators. They could move from a weak to a strong currency hoping to reap profits when a revaluation occurred. If, however, monetary authorities managed to avoid revaluation, they could return to other currencies with no loss. The combination of risk-free speculation with the availability of huge sums was highly destabilizing.|$|E
25|$|Disciplinary {{expectations}} {{extend beyond}} the military family. Family members know that their actions and behavior can have <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the military service member's career. The consequences of misbehavior for a military brat are generally greater than for civilian children. A military person's career and social identity can be dashed in seconds by a willful or careless child. For example, when a military brat gets in trouble, the authorities may call the parent's Commanding Officer or the Base Commander before, or instead of, calling the brat's parents. If the commanding officer or base commander is contacted, the brat's behavior may {{become a part of}} the military member's record, and adversely affect his or her ability to be promoted or the duty assignments (particularly overseas) that lead to advancement.|$|E
25|$|Another {{cause is}} {{the rate at}} which income is taxed coupled with the {{progressivity}} of the tax system. A progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases. In a progressive tax system, the level of the top tax rate will often have <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the level of inequality within a society, either increasing it or decreasing it, provided that income does not change {{as a result of the}} change in tax regime. Additionally, steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board. The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.|$|E
40|$|This study uses Kaohsiung Port as a {{case study}} to {{evaluate}} the relationships between port security quality, port service quality, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty.

Class A battlefields are principal strategic operations having <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> {{the course of the}} war. With this rating the commission placed Glorieta Pass on the same level as battles such as Gettysburg and Antietam. The priority I rating identified Glorieta Pass as being not only one of the most important, but {{also one of the most}} highly endangered battlefields in the country. Only ten other battlefields received the priority I (class A) rating. The commission recommended that Congress focus its preservation efforts on priority I, nationally significant battlefields.|$|E
