5|$|Hope is {{traditionally}} considered by Christians as a theological virtue (a virtue {{associated with the}} grace of God, rather than with work or self-improvement).

5|$|In {{at least}} some species, once a {{bumblebee}} has visited <b>a</b> <b>flower,</b> it leaves a scent mark on it. This scent mark deters bumblebees from visiting that flower until the scent degrades. This scent mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in different locations (e.g. nest, neutral, and food sites), and they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers, and {{may be able to}} identify who else has visited <b>a</b> <b>flower.</b> Bumblebees rely on this chemical bouquet more when the flower has a high handling time, that is, where it takes a longer time for the bee to find the nectar once inside the flower.|$|E
5|$|In the four-armed form, one of {{the left}} arms rests on Nandi's head, while the other is bent in kataka pose and holds a nilotpala (blue lotus) or hangs loosely at her side. In the three-armed representation, the left hand holds <b>a</b> <b>flower,</b> a mirror or a parrot. In the case of {{two-armed}} icons, the left hand rests on Nandi's head, hangs loose or holds either <b>a</b> <b>flower,</b> a mirror or a parrot. The parrot may be also perched on Parvati's wrist. Her hand(s) is/are adorned with ornaments like a keyura (anklet) or kankana (bangles).|$|E
5|$|Pollen {{is removed}} from flowers {{deliberately}} or incidentally by bumblebees. Incidental removal occurs when bumblebees {{come in contact with}} the anthers of <b>a</b> <b>flower</b> while collecting nectar. When it enters <b>a</b> <b>flower,</b> the bumblebee's body hairs receive a dusting of pollen from the anthers. In queens and workers this is then groomed into the corbiculae (pollen baskets) on the hind legs where it can be seen as bulging masses that may contain as many as a million pollen grains. Male bumblebees do not have corbiculae and do not purposively collect pollen. Bumblebees are also capable of buzz pollination, in which they dislodge pollen from the anthers by creating a resonant vibration with their flight muscles.|$|E

In special aggressive resemblance, {{the animal}} looks like something else, luring the prey or host to approach, for example when <b>a</b> <b>flower</b> mantis resembles {{a particular kind of}} flower, such as an orchid. In general aggressive resemblance, the predator or parasite blends in with the background, for example when a leopard is hard to see in long grass.|$|E

5|$|Even in {{his early}} years, Linnæus {{seemed to have a}} liking for plants, flowers in particular. Whenever he was upset, he was given <b>a</b> <b>flower,</b> which {{immediately}} calmed him.

5|$|Mimesis is also {{employed}} by some predators and parasites to lure their prey. For example, <b>a</b> <b>flower</b> mantis mimics {{a particular kind}} of flower, such as an orchid.

5|$|At {{least three}} aspects of flowers {{appear to have}} coevolved between {{flowering}} plants and insects, because they involve communication between these organisms. Firstly, flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent; insects use this scent to determine how far away <b>a</b> <b>flower</b> is, to approach it, and to identify where to land and finally to feed. Secondly, flowers attract insects with patterns of stripes leading to the rewards of nectar and pollen, and colours such as blue and ultraviolet, to which their eyes are sensitive; in contrast, bird-pollinated flowers tend to be red or orange. Thirdly, flowers such as some orchids mimic females of particular insects, deceiving males into pseudocopulation.|$|E
5|$|Auxiliary farm {{buildings}} {{associated with the}} mansion include the original springhouse. To {{the rear of the}} home the oldest section of residence can be seen. The ell consists of four rooms as well as the kitchen and smokehouse. The smokehouse was built as part of the existing structure, and not free standing as is most often seen. The rear ell structure served as the first residence for the family while the primary residence was constructed. To the east of the house is the family burial ground. Behind the house is <b>a</b> <b>flower</b> garden. The slave cemetery lies beyond the flower garden. Documented but no longer existing buildings include multiple slave houses, a large stable due-west of the mansion, an ash house, and a garden house.|$|E
5|$|Flower was {{intended}} as a spiritual successor to Flow. Using the PlayStation 3's motion sensitive controller, the player controls wind that blows <b>a</b> <b>flower</b> petal through the air. Flying close to flowers results in the player's petal being followed by other flower petals. Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world, such as bringing vibrant color to previously dead fields or activating stationary windmills. The game features no text or dialogue, forming a narrative arc primarily through visual representation and emotional cues. It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 12, 2009.|$|E
