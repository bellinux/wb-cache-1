5|$|A {{cerebellar}} disorder may {{be present}} if the person cannot stand with arms extended, feet touching and eyes closed without swaying (Romberg's sign); if there is <b>a</b> <b>tremor</b> when the person reaches for an object; or {{if he or she}} is unable to touch a fixed point, close the eyes and touch the same point again.|$|E
5|$|The two men saw an {{extraordinarily}} dense cloud rising rapidly above the peak. This cloud and {{a request by}} a messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, but that night <b>a</b> <b>tremor</b> awoke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon {{the house for the}} courtyard. Further tremors near dawn caused the population to abandon the village and caused disastrous wave action in the Bay of Naples.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. <b>A</b> <b>tremor</b> or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E

50|$|The {{physical}} {{characteristics of the}} tremor {{and the history of}} the patient will contribute to the diagnosis of Holmes <b>tremor.</b> <b>A</b> doctor will determine if the tremor is present during rest or voluntary muscle contraction and the frequency of the <b>tremor.</b> <b>A</b> Holmes <b>tremor</b> is generally made worse upon standing and upon intentional movements. Also, <b>a</b> Holmes <b>tremor</b> is not as rhythmic as other tremors.|$|R

When he goes to school the next day, he finds Harry is furious with him once more over forgetting their studying arrangements once more. At night, Hammerhead tells Shocker the Big Man is displeased with his failure. Meanwhile, Peter unsuccessfully tries to ask out Jonah's assistant, Betty Brant. After <b>a</b> <b>tremor</b> rattles the entire city, Peter, as Spider-Man, discovers it is the Shocker, leaving him a trail that leads to a condemned theater. During their fight, Spider-Man unsuccessfully tries to find out who hired him before finally bringing the building down and defeating the Shocker.|$|E
5|$|Suffering from {{recurrent}} fever and <b>a</b> <b>tremor</b> (possibly malaria) since his voyage, Cabral withdrew to Santarém in 1509. He spent his remaining years there. Only sketchy {{information is available}} as to his activities during that time. According to a royal letter dated 17 December 1509, Cabral was {{party to a dispute}} over a transaction involving property which belonged to him. Another letter of that same year reported that he was to receive certain privileges for an undisclosed military service. In 1518, or perhaps previously, he was raised from fidalgo to knight in the King's Council and was entitled to a monthly allowance of 2,437 reais. This was in addition to the annual allowance granted to him in 1497, and still being paid. Cabral died of unspecified causes, most probably in 1520. He was buried in the São João Evangelista chapel of the Convento da Graça in Santarém.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>tremor</b> can {{be defined}} as a rhythmic, back and forth or {{oscillating}} involuntary movement about a joint axis. Tremors are symmetric about a midpoint within the movement, and both portions of the movement occur at the same speed. Unlike the other hyperkinetic movements, tremors lack both the jerking associated movements and posturing.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{harmonic}} <b>tremor</b> is <b>a</b> {{sustained release}} of seismic and infrasonic energy {{typically associated with}} the underground movement of magma, the venting of volcanic gases from magma, or both. It is a long-duration release of seismic energy, with distinct spectral lines, that often precedes or accompanies a volcanic eruption. More generally, <b>a</b> volcanic <b>tremor</b> is <b>a</b> sustained signal {{that may or may}} not possess these harmonic spectral features. Being a long-duration continuous signal from a temporally extended source, <b>a</b> volcanic <b>tremor</b> contrasts distinctly with transient sources of seismic radiation, such as tremors that are typically associated with earthquakes and explosions.|$|R

25|$|Tremor in {{peripheral}} neuropathy may {{occur when the}} nerves that supply the body’s muscles are traumatized by injury, disease, abnormality in the central nervous system, or {{as the result of}} systemic illnesses. Peripheral neuropathy can affect the whole body or certain areas, such as the hands, and may be progressive. Resulting sensory loss may be seen as <b>a</b> <b>tremor</b> or ataxia (inability to coordinate voluntary muscle movement) of the affected limbs and problems with gait and balance. Clinical characteristics may be similar to those seen in patients with essential tremor.|$|E

25|$|In September 1910, {{a series}} of fifty-two {{earthquakes}} caused a construction crew near Flagstaff to leave the area. In 1912, the year Arizona achieved statehood, on August 18, an earthquake caused a 50-mile crack in the San Francisco Range. In early January 1935, the state experienced {{a series of}} earthquakes, in the Yuma area and near the Grand Canyon. Arizona experienced its largest earthquake in 1959, with <b>a</b> <b>tremor</b> of a magnitude 5.6. It was centered near Fredonia, in the state's northwest near the border with Utah. The tremor was felt {{across the border in}} Nevada and Utah.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{aftershocks}} occurred on 13 June. <b>A</b> <b>tremor</b> of 5.7 on the Richter scale was felt at 1pm NZT, with {{a depth of}} 9km, its epicentre at Taylors Mistake. A 6.3 tremor occurred just over an hour later, with a depth of 6km, located 10km east of the city. Power was cut to around 54,000 homes, with further damage and liquefaction in already weakened areas. The Lyttelton Timeball Station collapsed and Christchurch Cathedral sustained more damage. At least 46 people were reported injured. These were followed by a magnitude 5.4 quake {{at a depth of}} 8km and centred 10km south-west of Christchurch at 10:34pm on 21 June 2011.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>tremor</b> is an involuntary, {{somewhat}} rhythmic, muscle contraction {{and relaxation}} involving to-and-fro movements {{of one or}} more body parts. It is the most common of all involuntary movements and can affect the hands, arms, eyes, face, head, vocal cords, trunk, and legs. Most tremors occur in the hands. In some people, tremor is a symptom of another neurological disorder. Many different forms of tremor have been identified, such as essential tremor or Parkinsonian tremor. It is argued that tremors are likely to be multifactorial in origin, with contributions from neural oscillations in the central nervous systems, but also from peripheral mechanisms such as reflex loop resonances.|$|E
25|$|Mount St. Helens {{experienced}} major activity {{again on}} March 8, 2005 at about 5:30P.M. PST, when a 36,000-foot (11km) plume of steam and presumably ash was witnessed {{emerging from the}} volcano, accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>tremor</b> that measured about magnitude 2.5. The plume was visible from the metropolitan areas of Seattle, Washington, to Salem, Oregon, but only lasted for about 20–30minutes. Ash was reported falling from the sky in Yakima, Washington, and surrounding areas. This activity was not considered a large eruption but merely a minor release of pressure consistent {{with the nature of}} dome building. Scientists believed it was triggered by a partial collapse of the lava dome. There was no increase in quake activity before the volcanic event.|$|E
25|$|Vibrato is a {{technique}} in which a sustained note wavers very quickly and consistently between a higher and a lower pitch, giving the note a slight quaver. Vibrato is the pulse or wave in a sustained tone. Vibrato occurs naturally and {{is the result of}} proper breath support and a relaxed vocal apparatus. Some studies have shown that vibrato {{is the result of a}} neuromuscular tremor in the vocal folds. In 1922 Max Schoen was the first to make the comparison of vibrato to <b>a</b> <b>tremor</b> due to change in amplitude, lack of automatic control and it being half the rate of normal muscular discharge. Some singers use vibrato as a means of expression. Many successful artists can sing a deep, rich vibrato.|$|E
40|$|Non-volcanic tremors {{are found}} at several {{subduction}} zones like in SW Japan, and Cascadia. There {{are indications that}} non-volcanic tremors are related to fluid processes. In Central America the serpentinized Cocos plate subducts below the Caribbean plate. An array of borehole stations is operated since June 2006 on Nicoya peninsula in Northwest Costa Rica. The Geosig seismometer were installed in 100 m below surface and the signals are recorded on Guralp data recorders. Since June 2006 4 major periods of non-volcanic tremor activity occurred in May 2007, August 2008, February 2009 and June 2009. They lasted between 6 and 11 days and have <b>a</b> minimum <b>tremor</b> activity of 500 minutes. Statistical analysis show that <b>a</b> major <b>tremor</b> period of minimum 7 days and 600 minutes can be expected every year. 14 minor periods show <b>an</b> <b>tremor</b> activity between 50 and 300 minutes and a duration between 2 and 6 days.
