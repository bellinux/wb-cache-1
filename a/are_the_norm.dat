5|$|There are two {{distinct}} wine-producing regions in Croatia. The continental {{region in the}} northeast of the country, especially Slavonia, is capable of producing premium wines, particularly whites. Along the north coast, Istrian and Krk wines {{are similar to those}} produced in neighbouring Italy, while further south in Dalmatia, Mediterranean-style red wines <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm.</b> Annual production of wine exceeds 140million litres. Croatia was almost exclusively a wine-consuming country up until the late 18th century when a more massive production and consumption of beer started; the annual consumption of beer in 2008 was 83.3litres per capita which placed Croatia in 15th place among the world's countries.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT — Pedagogy is {{a pillar}} of human culture and society. Telling each other {{information}} and showing each other {{how to do things}} comes naturally to us. A strong case has been made that declarative knowledge <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> of assertion, which is our primary way of telling others information. This paper presents an analogous case for the hypothesis that procedural knowledge <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> of instructional demonstration, which is a primary way of showing others how to do things. Knowledge <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> of telling and showing. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> prime pedagogical principle...|$|R

25|$|Valved brass {{instruments}} use {{a set of}} valves (typically three or four but {{as many as seven}} or more in some cases) operated by the player's fingers that introduce additional tubing, or crooks, into the instrument, changing its overall length. This family includes all of the modern {{brass instruments}} except the trombone: the trumpet, horn (also called French horn), euphonium, and tuba, as well as the cornet, flugelhorn, tenor horn (alto horn), baritone horn, sousaphone, and the mellophone. As valved instruments are predominant among the brasses today, a more thorough discussion of their workings can be found below. The valves are usually piston valves, but can be rotary valves; the latter <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> for the horn (except in France) and are also common on the tuba.|$|E
25|$|It is {{nonsensical}} and counter-intuitive {{to believe}} that Nature (or God) created human life only {{to allow it to}} end after a definite period of time. A human being must be able to live indefinitely, or to put it in another way, it {{should not be allowed to}} die through ageing. There must be something inside us, that can be modified (perhaps at conception) that will shift the entire death pathway into another, parallel pathway, that will have no predetermined end. This ‘something’ is in fact, the evolutionary impetus to achieve higher levels of complexity in the quickest way possible. There should be a way to enhance this process and accelerate our transition from the process of evolution by natural selection to a post-Darwinian, transhumanist domain where indefinite life-spans <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm.</b>|$|E

The intention was to field {{candidates in}} large numbers to maximise the likelihood of recognition as a national party by the Election Commission. The outcome was that 4 AAP candidates won, all from Punjab. Consequently, AAP became a recognised state party in Punjab. The party obtained 2% of all votes cast nationwide and 414 of its candidates forfeited their deposit by failing to secure one-sixth of the vote in their constituencies. Although the party secured 32.9 per cent of the votes in Delhi, it failed to win any seats there.|$|E

25|$|As control measures, baits <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> in both {{agriculture}} and the garden. In recent years, iron phosphate baits have emerged and are preferred over the more toxic metaldehyde, especially because domestic or wild animals may {{be exposed to}} the bait. The environmentally safer iron phosphate {{has been shown to be}} at least as effective as baits. Methiocarb baits are no longer widely used. Parasitic nematodes (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita) are a commercially available biological control method that are effective against a wide range of common slug species. The nematodes are applied in water and actively seek out slugs in the soil and infect them, leading to the death of the slug. This control method is suitable for use in organic growing systems. Other slug control methods are generally ineffective on a large scale, but can be somewhat useful in small gardens. These include beer traps, diatomaceous earth, crushed eggshells, coffee grounds, and copper. It is of scientific interest that salt kills slugs by causing water to leave the body owing to osmosis but this is not used for agricultural control as soil salinity is detrimental to crops.|$|E
25|$|The Lonari Kunbis are {{regarded}} as one of the established cultivating communities in Maharashtra. The Lonari are presently located in the eastern part of the Vidharbha region and in the adjoining districts of Madhya Pradesh. The name of the community comes from Lonar lake in the Mehkar-Chikhli taluka of the Buldhana district, where their original occupation was salt-making. They migrated from the Lonar lake region and eventually arrived in present-day Maharashtra. The oral history of the community contains an elaborate story of their migration. According to tradition, the community migrated to Aurgangabad from their original place of origin in the Lucknow district of Uttar Pradesh, then to Buldana and finally to their current locations in the Amravati and Betul districts of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, respectively. In the two tehsils of Multai and Warud in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashra, respectively, the Lonari Kunbi are also known as Deshmukhs and Kumbhares. The Lonari now rely on the gram panchayats under the state government as changes in the sociopolitical landscape have diminished the influence of the traditional caste council. Monogamy and adult marriages <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm,</b> but marriages among identical surnames (referred to as hargote) is not allowed. According to the Lonari Kunbi community, they do not engage in the practice of dowry The Lonari Kunbis follow the joint family system, but restrictions on land-owning for agriculture under the Land Revenue Act and the improved educational status of newer generations has caused nuclear families to form. A large number of community members depend on revenue from agriculture, either by cultivating their own lands or working as agricultural labour. The Lonari Kunbi community has made much progress since the 1950s, but problem of poverty is still prevalent and economic instability is still a concern to community members.|$|E
500|$|Stylistically, Vespertine {{incorporates}} {{elements of}} both art and dance music. For example, the instrumentation of choir, strings, and harp is suggestive of Romantic art music, while the [...] "synthesised keyboard sonorities, filtering effects and complex percussive sounds" [...] are elements characteristic of dance-based pop. According to Nicola Dibben: ...the way in which classical and dance-based elements are made to sit alongside one another {{as part of the}} same texture mediates the relationship between the two: the spiritual and the sensual are shown to be compatible, perhaps even suggesting that the sensual is spiritual, and that it can facilitate transcendence and hence grant access to a utopian world. Vespertine is also characterized by [...] "the obsession with sonic traces of analog technology — that is, the pervasive use of loops, static and white noise— despite the obviously digital orientation of twenty-first-century electronics." [...] Unlike previous albums like Debut and Post, [...] "electronic sounds <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm,</b> and the acoustic sounds become the interjections." [...] Björk's voice is used as a supplement to [...] "the complex electronic textures".
