40|$|The {{mechanism}} of transport of the herbicide 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole (<b>amitrole)</b> into Phaseolus vulgaris roots {{appears to be}} passive, as judged by the effect of temperature (Q 10 = 1. 3 between 15 and 25 °C) {{and the lack of}} sensitivity to metabolic inhibition afforded by 2, 4 -dinitrophenol and NaN 3. <b>Amitrole</b> absorption is a linear function of external concentration over several orders of magnitude and, thus, is not facilitated by a carrier mechanism. The absorption of <b>amitrole</b> is sensitive to external pH, being stimulated under acid conditions. This stimulation of <b>amitrole</b> absorption is seen at low (≤ 1 millimolar) <b>amitrole</b> concentrations, but not at high (50 millimolar) <b>amitrole</b> levels. While the apparent octanol-water partition coefficient varies with the pH of the aqueous phase, there is no clear correspondence between absorption and the apparent partition coefficient. Roots do not accumulate <b>amitrole</b> above concentration equilibrium; however, {{at a time when the}} net <b>amitrole</b> content of the root tissue begins to saturate, <b>amitrole</b> can be detected in the xylem stream. On a fresh-weight basis, <b>amitrole</b> absorption by roots is equal to that accomplished by trifoliate-leaf tissue. An estimate of the permeability coefficient (according to the analysis of Tyree et al. 1979 Plant Physiol 63 : 367 - 374) suggests that <b>amitrole</b> possesses near-optimal permeability for an ambimobile solute, on the order of 2. 12 (± 0. 47) × 10 − 9 meters per second...|$|E
40|$|Interference with {{histidine}} metabolism, {{inhibition of}} pigment biosynthesis, or {{both have been}} the principal candidates for the primary site of action of 3 -amino 1, 2, 4 -triazole (<b>amitrole).</b> Arabidopsis thaliana is sensitive to 1, 2, 4 -triazole- 3 -alanine, a feedback inhibitor of histidine biosynthesis, and this effect is reversed by histidine. The combination of triazolealanine and histidine, however, does not reverse the herbicidal effect of <b>amitrole.</b> This indicates that <b>amitrole</b> toxicity is not caused by histidine starvation, nor is it caused by the accumulation of a toxic intermediate of the histidine pathway. <b>Amitrole</b> inhibits root elongation at lower concentrations than it causes pigment bleaching in the leaves. In contrast, fluridone, a known inhibitor of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway does not block root elongation.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the construction of}} a carbon paste electrode (CPE) impregnated with nanoparticles of iron(II) phthalocyanine (nanoFePc). The new electrode (nanoFePc-CPE) revealed interesting electrocatalytic behaviour towards amitrole; pure catalytic diffusion-controlled process, with high Tafel slope (235 mV/decade) suggesting strong binding of <b>amitrole</b> with nanoFePc catalyst. The effects of catalyst loading, varying pH and electrolytes were studied. The mechanism for the interaction of <b>amitrole</b> with the nanoFePc is proposed to involve the Fe[superscript (III) ]Pc/Fe[superscript (II) ]Pc redox process. Using chronoamperometry (E = + 0. 42 V versus Ag/AgCl) technique, the sensor was reliably employed for <b>amitrole</b> assay at pH 12. 0 phosphate buffer (with sodium sulphate as the supporting electrolyte) for up to 12 nM <b>amitrole</b> with excellent sensitivity (ca. 3. 44 μA/nM) and low detection limit (3. 62 ± 0. 11 nM, i. e. 0. 305 μg L[superscript (− 1) ] using the YB + 3 σB criterion and 0. 85 ± 0. 03 nM, i. e. 70 ng/L with the Y[subscript B] + 2 [subscript σB] criterion) as well as satisfactory amperometric selectivity coefficient (K[subscript amp] ≈ 7. 4 × 10 [superscript (− 4) ] for ammonium thiocyanate, a component of many <b>amitrole</b> herbicides, and 3. 2 × 10 [superscript (− 3) ] for asulam pesticide).

The synthesis of protective carotenoids was drastically impaired, with some accumulation of lycopene and a very low production of beta-carotene and xanthophylls.

40|$|Within their aquatic habitats, larval {{amphibians}} {{are often}} subjected to multiple natural and anthropic stressors. Among these, predation and waterborne pollution represent {{two types of}} stressing factor that frequently co-occur. In this connection, the present laboratory {{study was designed to}} investigate the effects of <b>amitrole,</b> a commonly used triazole herbicide, on the predator–prey relationship between common frog tadpoles (Rana temporaria) and larval spotted salamander (Salamandra salamandra). Tadpoles were exposed for 3 days to 0, 0. 01, 0. 1, 1, and 10 mg/L <b>amitrole,</b> either in the absence or in the presence of larval salamanders. Tadpole behavior (refuge use, movements) was monitored every day, and the predation efficiency was assessed {{at the end of the}} experiment by counting the number of surviving tadpoles. In the absence of the predator, amitrole-exposed tadpoles (at 0. 01, 0. 1, and 1 mg/L) increased their refuge use and decreased their rate of movements. In the presence of the predator, <b>amitrole</b> contamination did not affect tadpole behavior, except on the first day, where tadpoles exposed to 10 mg/L were found to be significantly more active than unexposed control tadpoles. Throughout the experiment, control tadpoles were the only group to show significant reductions of activity and visibility in response to the predator’s presence. In contrast, tadpoles exposed to 0. 01 and 0. 1 mg/L <b>amitrole</b> increased their refuge use in response to the predator, whereas their rate of movements remained unaffected. Furthermore, exposures of tadpoles to the two highest <b>amitrole</b> concentrations (1 and 10 mg/L) resulted in the loss of both behavioral responses to the predator’s presence. Interestingly, the lack of antipredator behavior in amitrole-exposed tadpoles did not enhance their vulnerability to predation by the larval salamander. Moreover, tadpoles exposed to the two highest herbicide concentrations showed a better survival than unexposed controls, indicating that <b>amitrole</b> contamination also had detrimental effects on the predatory behavior of the larval salamander. These findings emphasize the need to consider the effects of contaminants on both predator and prey before drawing conclusions about the possible consequences of prey behavioral modifications on the predation risk...|$|E

The herbicide impacts on hatching time were restricted to embryos incubated in the presence of conspecific cues, with individuals exposed to 0. 1 and 1 mg/L showing an extended embryonic period compared to controls in uncontaminated water. Whether tested alone or in combination with conspecific cues, <b>amitrole</b> also induced slight morphological changes but did not affect larval growth or behavioral activity. Thus, depending on the trait considered, both chemical stressors exhibited either single or interactive effects.

40|$|Thyroid hormones (THs) play an {{important}} role in the development and metabolism of fish through their influences on genetic transcription and are targets for endocrine disruptive agents in the aquatic environment. <b>Amitrole</b> is a pesticide potentially interfering with thyroid hormone regulation. In this study, the rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) was exposed to different levels of 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole(amitrole) and allowed to recover in clean water. Plasma TH levels and the expression of TH-related genes, including transthyretin(ttr), deiodinases (d 1 and d 2), and the thyroid hormone receptor (trot) from the livers and brains were evaluated. After exposure, the plasma TH levels did not change. Histopathological observations showed that livers were degenerated at 10, 000 ng/l and these damages could be recovered by the withdrawal of <b>amitrole.</b> However, the ttr, d 1, and d 2 mRNA levels in the livers of males were significantly up-regulated in all exposure groups (p = 100 ng/l and a fivefold decrease of tr alpha mRNA levels at >= 10 ng/l were observed (p = 100 ng/l. Moreover, the d 2 mRNA levels in the brains of males and females were up-regulated at 10, 000 ng/l. These results indicated that <b>amitrole</b> exposure could result in alternations of ttr, d 1, d 2, and trot gene expression in different tissues of the rare minnow. The expression of these TH-related genes in males was more sensitive to <b>amitrole</b> than those of females. Recovery in clean water was associated with the selective regulation of TH-related gene transcription in the rare minnow.

40|$|In {{amphibians}} and fishes, {{evidence is}} increasing that chemical cues from injured conspecifics {{can play a}} role in the chemical labelling and learned recognition of unfamiliar predators. In this laboratory study, we tested the prediction that prior chemical exposure to a non-native predator feeding on conspecific tadpoles will subsequently allow tadpoles of the common toad (Bufo bufo) to recognize the chemical cues specifically released by this starved predator. Furthermore, we investigated the vulnerability of this chemically-mediated process to herbicide contamination. With these aims in view, groups of tadpoles were kept either unexposed or exposed for ten days to chemical cues from Turkish crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus) previously fed on tadpoles, both in uncontaminated water and in the presence of four sublethal concentrations of <b>amitrole</b> (0. 01, 0. 1, 1 and 10 mg. l− 1). We then assessed the effects of the six conditioning treatments on general activity and behavioural response to chemical cues from starved crayfish. Larval treatments did not affect the general activity of the tadpoles. By contrast, the treatments had significant effects on the behavioural response to the test solution prepared form starved crayfish. The only tadpoles to show an antipredator behavioural response to the chemical stimulation from starved crayfish belonged to the groups derived from chemical exposure to tadpole-fed crayfish in uncontaminated water and in contaminated water with the lowest concentration of <b>amitrole</b> (0. 01 mg. l− 1). Conversely, this chemical stimulation produced no behavioural change in the control group or in the groups derived from exposure to tadpole-fed crayfish in contaminated water containing 0. 1, 1 and 10 mg. l− 1 of <b>amitrole.</b> This study demonstrates that chemical cues released during the predator’s feeding activity can subsequently be used by common toad tadpoles in the recognition of an unfamiliar predator. In addition, our results show that the presence of sublethal <b>amitrole</b> concentrations can impair this recognition process.

Istraženi su fina građa plastida i sadržaj karotenoida tijekom više stadija zoridbe plodova paprike (Capsicum annuum). Zreli crveni plod sadrži vretenaste kromoplaste koji nastaju iz leukokloroplasta. Herbicidi amitrol i SAN 9789 koče sintezu karotenoida i razvitak tipičnih vretenastih kromoplasta. Oba herbicida sprečavaju stvaranje tubula, a uzrokuju nagomilavanje plasto- globula. Plastidi tretirani herbicidom SAN 9789 sadrže samo nekoliko proširenih tilakoida, dok amitrolom tretirani plastidi sadrže proširenja tubularnog retikuluma, koja su ispunjena finom zrnatom supstancom.

40|$|NKX 2 - 1 is a {{homeodomain}} {{transcription factor}} that {{is critical for}} genesis of the thyroid and transcription of the thyroid-specific genes. Nkx 2 - 1 -thyroid-conditional hypomorphic mice were previously developed in which Nkx 2 - 1 gene expression is lost in 50 % of the thyroid cells. Using this mouse line as compared with wild-type and Nkx 2 - 1 heterozygous mice, a thyroid carcinogenesis study was carried out using the genotoxic carcinogen N-bis(2 -hydroxypropyl) -nitrosamine (DHPN), followed by sulfadimethoxine (SDM) or the non-genotoxic carcinogen <b>amitrole</b> (3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole). A significantly higher incidence of adenomas was obtained in Nkx 2 - 1 -thyroid-conditional hypomorphic mice {{as compared with the}} other two groups of mice only when they were treated with DHPN + SDM, but not <b>amitrole.</b> A bromodeoxyuridine incorporation study revealed that thyroids of the Nkx 2 - 1 -thyroid-conditional hypomorphic mice had > 2 -fold higher constitutive cell proliferation rate than the other two groups of mice, suggesting that this may be at least partially responsible for the increased incidence of adenoma in this mouse line after genotoxic carcinogen exposure.

40|$|Giant ragweed was {{the first}} {{glyphosate}} resistant weed identified in Canada. It is a very competetive weed in row crop production and {{has been found to}} drastically reduce yields of soybean; therefore, control of this competitive weed is essential. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine effective control options for glyphosate resistant giant ragweed in soybean with herbicides applied preplant. Eighteen herbicide combinations were evaluated in field studies conducted in 2011 and 2012 at five locations with confirmed glyphosate resistant giant ragweed. Glyphosate plus 2, 4 -D ester or <b>amitrole</b> provided the best control of glyphosate resistant giant ragweed 4 WAA. Glyphosate plus 2, 4 -D ester provided 98 to 99 % control and was equivalent to the weed free check at all locations. Glyphosate plus <b>amitrole</b> provided 90 % to 93 % control and was equivalent to the weed free check at 4 of 5 locations. Herbicides providing residual activity provided variable control across all locations. Of the herbicides with residual activity evaluated, glyphosate plus linuron provided the best control of glyphosate resistant giant ragweed; however, control was inconsistent across locations and years. Glyphosate plus linuron provided 23 % to 99 % controland was equal to the weed free check at one location 8 WAA. </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to determine sorption coefficients of eight herbicides (alachlor, <b>amitrole,</b> atrazine, simazine, dicamba, imazamox, imazethapyr, and pendimethalin) to seven agricultural soils from sites throughout Lithuania. The measured sorp-tion coefficients {{were used to}} predict the susceptibility of these herbicides to leach to groundwater. Soil-water partitioning coeffi-cients were measured in batch equilibrium studies using radiolabeled herbicides. In most soils, sorption followed the general trend pendimethalin>alachlor>atrazine∼amitrole∼simazine>imazethapyr>imazamox>dicamba, consistent with the trends in hydropho-bicity (log Kow) except {{in the case of}} <b>amitrole.</b> For several herbicides, sorption coefficients and calculated retardation factors were lowest (predicted to be most susceptible to leaching) in a soil of intermediate organic carbon content and sand content. Calculated herbicide retardation factors were high for soils with high organic carbon contents. Estimated leaching times under saturated con-ditions, assuming no herbicide degradation and no preferential water flow, were more strongly affected by soil textural effects on predicted water flow than by herbicide sorption effects. All herbicides were predicted to be slowest to leach in soils with high clay and low sand contents, and fastest to leach in soils with high sand content and low organic matter content. Herbicide management is important to the continued increase in agricultural production and profitability in the Baltic region, and these results will be useful in identifying critical areas requiring improved management practices to reduce water contamination by pesticides...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} growth {{temperature}} on chloroplast responses to norflurazon and <b>amitrole,</b> two herbicides inhibiting carotenogenesis, at phytoene desaturation and lycopene cyclization, respectively, were studied in leaves of maize plants grown at 20 [*]°C and 30 [*]°C in light. At the lower temperature both chemicals caused severe photo‐oxidative damage to chloroplasts. In organelles of norflurazon‐treated leaves neither carotenoids nor chlorophylls were detectable and the thylakoid system was dismantled. In organelles of amitrole‐treated leaves lycopene was accumulated, but small quantities of β‐carotene and xanthophylls were also produced. Moreover, some chlorophyll {{and a few}} inner membranes still persisted, although these latter were disarranged, lacking essential protein components and devoid of photosynthetic function. The increase in plant growth temperature to 30 [*]°C did not change the norflurazon effects on carotenoid synthesis and the photo‐oxidative damage suffered by chloroplasts. By contrast, in organelles of amitrole‐treated leaves a large increase in photoprotective carotenoid biosynthesis occurred, with a consequent recovery of chlorophyll content, ultrastructural organization and thylakoid composition and functionality. This suggests that thermo‐modulated steps could exist in the carotenogenic pathway, between the points inhibited by the two herbicides. Moreover it shows that, unlike C 3 species, C 4 species, such as maize, can express a strong tolerance to herbicides like <b>amitrole,</b> when supplied to plants growing at their optimum temperature conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of enzymatic activities {{involved in the}} biosynthesis of tryptophan in Neurospora crassa was examined under various conditions in several strains. With growth-limiting tryptophan, the {{formation of}} four enzymatic activities, anthranilic acid synthetase (AAS), anthranilate- 5 -phosphoribosylpyrophosphate phosphoribosyl transferase (PRAT), indoleglycerol phosphate synthetase (InGPS), and tryptophan synthetase (TS) did not occur coordinately. AAS and TS activities began to increase immediately, whereas PRAT and InGPS activities began to increase only after 6 to 12 hr of incubation. In the presence of <b>amitrole</b> (3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole), the formation of TS activity in a wild-type strain was more greatly enhanced than were AAS and InGPS activities. With a tr- 3 mutant, which ordinarily exhibits an elevated TS activity, <b>amitrole</b> did not produce an increase in TS activity greater than that observed on limiting tryptophan. With tr- 3 mutants, the increased levels of TS activity could be correlated with the accumulation of indoleglycerol in the medium; prior genetic blocks which prevented or reduced the synthesis of indoleglycerol also reduced the formation of TS activity. The addition of indoleglycerol to cultures of a double mutant (tr- 1, tr- 3) which could not synthesize indoleglycerol markedly stimulated the production of TS activity but not PRAT activity; the production of TS activity reached the same level with limiting or with excess tryptophan. A model explaining these and other related observations on enzyme formation in N. crassa is proposed...|$|E
40|$|The strigolactones are {{internal}} and rhizosphere signalling molecules in {{plants that are}} biosynthesised through carotenoid cleavage. They are secreted by host roots into the rhizosphere where they signal host-presence to the symbiotic arbuscular mycrorrhizal (AM) fungi and the parasitic plants of the Orobanche, Phelipanche and Striga genera. The seeds of these parasitic plants germinate after perceiving these signalling molecules. After attachment to the host root, the parasite negatively affects the host plant by withdrawing water, nutrients and assimilates through a direct connection with the host xylem. In {{many areas of the}} world these parasites are a threat to agriculture but so far very limited success has been achieved to minimize losses due to these parasitic weeds. Considering the carotenoid origin of the strigolactones, in the present study we investigated the possibilities to reduce strigolactone production in the roots of plants by blocking carotenoid biosynthesis using carotenoid inhibitors. Hereto the carotenoid inhibitors fluridone, norflurazon, clomazone and <b>amitrole</b> were applied to rice either through irrigation or through foliar spray. Irrigation application of all carotenoid inhibitors and spray application of <b>amitrole</b> significantly decreased strigolactone production, Striga hermonthica germination and Striga infection, also in concentrations too low to affect growth and development of the host plant. Hence, we demonstrate that the application of carotenoid inhibitors to plants can affect S. hermonthica germination and attachment indirectly by reducing the strigolactone concentration in the rhizosphere. This finding is useful for further studies on the relevance of the strigolactones in rhizosphere signalling. Since these inhibitors are available and accessible, they may represent an efficient technology for farmers, including poor subsistence farmers in the African continent, to control these harmful parasitic weed...|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} is presented {{of the effects}} of 181 chemicals in the (white/white+) (H>/H'+) eye mosaic assay, an in vivo short-term test measuring genetic damage hi somatic cells of Drosophila after treatment of larvae. The genetic principle of this system is loss of heterozygosity for the wild-type reporter gene w+, an event predominantly resulting from homologous interchromosomal mitotic recombination between the two X chromosomes of female genotypes. The H>/H>+ eye mosaic test detects a broad spectrum of DNA modifications, since all distinct classes of genotoxins are monitored. Non-DNA-reactive chemicals are in principle not detected by this system.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{herbicide}} isoxaben on the incorporation of radiolabeled glucose, leucine, uracil, and acetate into acid insoluble cell wall material, protein, nucleic acids, and fatty acids, respectively, was measured. Dichlobenil, cycloheximide, actinomycin D, and cerulenin, inhibitors of the incorporation of these precursors into these macromolecular components, functioned as expected, providing positive controls. The incorporation of radiolabeled glucose into an acid insoluble cell wall fraction was severely inhibited by isoxaben at nanomolar concentrations. <b>Amitrole,</b> fluridone, ethalfluralin, and chlorsulfuron, as well as cycloheximide, actinomycin D, and cerulenin did not inhibit incorporation of glucose into this fraction, ruling out a general nonspecific effect of herbicides on glucose incorporation. The evidence thus suggests that isoxaben is an extremely powerful and specific inhibitor of cell wall biosynthesis...|$|E
