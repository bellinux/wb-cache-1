40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to test different aspects that might influence the ability of spatial orientation of leopard gecko (Eublepharis macularius) in Morris water maze (MWM). This group of animals has already been tested once before (thesis Voňavková, 2013). After a few intervals (two & four months break) this test of allothetic orientation was repeated. Repetition of the test is necessary to verify whether there are evidence of a learned spatial orientation within the long-term memory or not (extinction of spatial information). The {{main objective}} of this thesis {{is to find out}} whether the animals are able to remember the orientation marks from the training after a several-months break, or if they will have to learn the task again from the beginning. In 18 % of tested geckos the track has been gradually shortened, but the time of finding goal-location (platform) remained the same. In 43 % of animals the time necessary to reach platform got worse, but the lenght of the track remained the same. Thus, animals remembered where the platform is located, but their motivation to reach it was much lower than at <b>a</b> <b>firts</b> few sessions. Another objective was to verify whether gecos are even able to compensate the active and pasive body movement by their head, keep the grafic marks on the arena in [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A {{great amount}} of {{attention}} has recently been paid to injuries; however, there are still certain types of injuries that have been ignored. There include sports injuries. Sports are, without a question, {{one of the most}} prominent phenomena of our time. Sports, physical education and other activities are usually carried out in order to improve one´s performance and physical condition or for health reasons. Injuries to different body parts are a very common health concern for most sports. My bachelor´s thesis focuses on sport injuries, their causes and possible preventive measures. The aim of my work was to identify amateur volleyball players´ awareness of the prevention of injuries caused while playing sports in the Havlíčkův Brod region. This aim was achieved. The survey was supposed to confirm or disprove the following hypotheses: H 1 : Amateur volleyball players are not well informed about sports injury prevention, and H 2 : Amateur volleyball players use only knee pads when playing. The H 1 hypothesis was confirmed. The results show that amateur volleyball players do not have sufficient knowledge in this field, are not aware of preventive measures and injury prevention level is very low. Only 30 % of respondents were instructed about safety principles, 48 % of the players did not consider fatigue the most important factor of injury occurrence, 54 % of the people played volleyball even when they were sick and 57 % of the respondents did not observe a recovery period. The H 2 hypothesis was disproved. Volleyball players do not use only knee pads when playing; they use other protective equipment such as belts, orthotics, special shoes and athletic tape. However, the survey identified certain problematic areas. Only 10 % of the players were aware of different kinds of prevention, only 7 % of the volleyball players knew the enviroment in which they played in and could locate <b>a</b> <b>firts</b> aid kit. Another serious issue was recurring injuries that were identified by 70 % of the respondents. In addition, playing under the influence of alcohol influence was admitted by 62 % of the respondents. The recommendation is to place more emphasis on instructing amateur volleyball players with respect to safety principles, injury prevention and all factors that might affect the occurrence of injuries...|$|E
40|$|Surakarta, central Java, {{witnesses}} {{proliferation of}} Islamic radical groups. Many expect that IAIN Surakarta becomes the strongest bulwark {{in the city}} to halt the growth of radicalism. Since 2006 / 2007, Faculty of Education and Teaching at IAIN Surakarta has adopted a program of Integral Muslim Personality Development Supervision written in a book. This program is potentially used to counter-attack the radical ideology. However, the question arises as to whether the content and curriculum of the program express moderate views of Islam or, even, contrarily spread the seed of radicalism. Using a content analysis, this study examines this program. This study find that a number of materials and references of the book in this program are inspired by and derived from Tarbiyah movement, and therefore it fails to be a counter discourse of radicalism for the students in this department. Even a closer look at into the curriculum and the content of the booklet reveals that the program adopts the Tarbiyah Movement methods and mentoring programs such as halaqa, usroh, mantuba and mutaba’ah. The program is thus not promising to serve  an effective means to wage a war against radicalism; it apparantly becomes <b>a</b> <b>firt</b> step toward seeding the Tarbiyah ideology.           Keywords: counter radicalism, education curriculum, P 2 KMI progra...|$|R

40|$|OBJETIVO: Identificar os achados na tomografia de coerência óptica (OCT) e suas variações ao longo de 12 meses, em pacientes portadores de degeneração macular relacionada à idade (DRMI), submetidos à terapia fotodinâmica com verteporfina (TFD). DESENHO DO ESTUDO: Série de casos, aberto, não aleatório e intervencionista. MÉTODOS: Pacientes acima de 50 anos, portadores de DMRI {{neovascular}} foram submetidos ao exame oftalmológico completo, angiofluoresceinografia e OCT antes do início do tratamento (V 0) e 3, 6, 9 e 12 meses após (V 3, V 6, V 9 e V 12, respectivamente). O tratamento empregado foi a TFD. A acuidade visual (AV) foi mensurada usando-se a tabela do ETDRS. Realizaram-se as medições das espessuras foveais: espessura intraretiniana foveal (FIRT), espessura foveal do complexo coriocapilar - EPR (FCC-EPRT) e espessura foveal total (TFT). Realizaram-se as mensurações das espessuras extrafoveais, em um raio de 1500 µ da fóvea: espessura intraretiniana extrafoveal (EFIRT), espessura extrafoveal do complexo coriocapilar - EPR (EFCC-EPRT) e espessura extrafoveal total (TEFT). Análise estatística foi realizada usando-se a análise de variância em blocos. RESULTADOS: Vinte e três olhos de 23 pacientes foram avaliados. Foram identificados nove achados à OCT: 1 º) espessamento das camadas intraretinianas na fóvea; 2 º) espessamento das camadas intraretinianas na região extrafoveal; 3 º) espessamento do complexo coriocapilar-EPR (FCC-EPRT) na fóvea; 4 º) espessamento do complexo coriocapilar-EPR na área extrafoveal; 5 º) presença de fluido sub-EPR; 6 º) presença de fluido sub-retiniano; 7 º) presença de fluido intraretiniano; 8 º) presença da membrana hialóide posterior aderida à retina; 9 º) presença da depressão foveal. Na visita inicial <b>a</b> <b>FIRT</b> e <b>a</b> TFT foram respectivamente 398, 5 µ e 639, 2 µ. Em V 12 foram 173, 7 µ e 423, 9 µ. A variação foi estatisticamente significante (p = 0, 008 e p = 0, 003, respectivamente). As outras espessuras mensuradas não tiveram variação estatisticamente significante. A depressão foveal estava presente em 36, 4 % dos olhos na visita inicial e em 78, 3 % em V 12. O fluido sub-retiniano estava presente em 36, 4 % em V 0 e em 8, 7 % em V 12. A AV na visita inicial foi 0, 93 e na visita final foi 1, 04 (p = 0, 127). CONCLUSÕES: A AV permaneceu inalterada ao longo do estudo. A depressão foveal estava presente em 78, 3 % dos olhos em V 12. <b>A</b> diminuição da <b>FIRT</b> e da TFT foi estatisticamente significante entre V 0 e V 12. PURPOSE: To {{identify the}} {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) findings in patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) treated with photodynamic therapy (PDT). STUDY DESIGN: Open, non-randomized, interventional case series. METHODS: ARMD patients were submitted to a complete ophthalmological examination, fluorescein angiography, and OCT at baseline (V 0), 3, 6, 9 and 12 months (V 3, V 6, V 9 and V 12, respectively). PDT was carried out according to the TAP study. Visual acuity (VA) was measured using the logMAR ETDRS chart. The following foveal measurements were performed: foveal intraretinal thickness (FIRT), foveal choriocapillaris - RPE complex thickness (FCC-RPET) and total foveal thickness (TFT). The extrafoveal thicknesses measured were: extrafoveal intraretinal thickness (EFIRT), extrafoveal choriocapillaris - RPE complex thickness (EFCC-RPET) and total extrafoveal thickness (TEFT). Statistical analysis was performed using the block variance analysis test. RESULTS: Twenty-three eyes of 23 patients were enrolled. This study identified nine OCT patterns: 1) thickening of the foveal intraretinal layers; 2) thickening of the extrafoveal intraretinal layers; 3) thickening of the foveal choriocapillaris - RPE complex; 4) thickening of the extrafoveal choriocapillaris - RPE complex; 5) intraretinal fluid; 6) subretinal fluid; 7) subretinal pigment epithelium (RPE) fluid; 8) vitreo-retinal adhesion; 9) foveal depression. At baseline, FIRT and TFT were 398. 5 µ and 639. 2 µ, respectively. At V 12 they were 173. 7 µ e 423. 9 µ, respectively, and this change was statistical significant (p= 0. 008 e p= 0. 003, respectively). The variation of the other foveal and extrafoveal measurements were not statistically significant. Foveal depression was present at baseline in 36. 4 % of the eyes, whereas at V 12 it was present in 78. 3 %. Subretinal fluid was present in 36. 4 % of eyes at V 0 and in 8. 7 % at V 12. VA at baseline was 0. 93 and it V 12 was 1. 04 (p= 0, 127). CONCLUSIONS: Visual acuity was stable throughout the study. Foveal depression was reestablished in 78. 3 % at V 12. FIRT and TFT decreased at a statistical significant level, from V 0 to V 12...|$|R

40|$|There is {{considerable}} evidence that Sertoli cell function is controlled {{not only by}} hormones, but also by locally produced growth factors and cytokines. To gain more insight into the nature and effects of cytokines potentially involved in the control of Sertoli cell function, we incubated rat Sertoli cells with media conditioned by activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Such media (PBMC-CM) {{are known to be}} an extremely rich source of a variety of cytokines. It was demonstrated that PMBC-CM and protein fractions derived from them stimulate Sertoli cell transferrin secretion and messenger RNA production more potently then peritubular cell-conditioned medium or <b>FIRT</b> (<b>a</b> combination of FSH, insulin, retinol, and testosterone). Transferrin secretion expressed per mg cell DNA was stimulated approximately 5 -fold by peritubular cell-conditioned medium or FIRT and nearly 20 -fold by PBMC-CM. The effects of PBMC-CM were accompanied by a limited increase in cAMP and a noticeable rise in cGMP. Affinity chromatography on a column coated with an antiserum directed against interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) showed that part of the activity in the PBMC-CM was related to IL- 1 beta. The remainder of the activity was largely retained by an affinity column coated with an antiserum that recognizes IL- 6 {{and a number of other}} known and unknown cytokines. Purified IL- 1 beta provoked a 2 - to 3 -fold stimulation of Sertoli cell transferrin secretion. More limited stimulatory effects were observed with IL- 6. Neither of these cytokines or their combination approached the degree of stimulation observed with crude PBMC-CM, suggesting that other cytokines are involved. It is concluded that the mixture of cytokines present in PBMC-CM is a more powerful stimulator of Sertoli cell transferrin secretion than any other agonist known at the present time. IL- 1 and IL- 6 may be responsible for part of the observed effects, but one or more other cytokines are probably involved. status: publishe...|$|R

So, their treatment has achieved great importance. Initiatives are needed to discern not just which treatment is effective, but in which conditions and for whom and, if possible, achieve it in the shortest time. Once the efficacy is established, further step {{must be taken to}} establish the effectiveness. After that, the third step to consider would be the efficiency. The current thesis has <b>a</b> double objective. <b>Firts,</b> it attempts to verify whether the Empirically Supported Treatment ETS can prove effectiveness in the applied field, especially in the anxiety disorders. Second, it is hoped that the present work serves to the dissemination of knowledge among psychologists. The current research gathers the results of four articles. The sample was form with the patients that had sought care in the Clinical Psychology Unit of the UCM, being a total of 122, and patients of the University Psychology Clinic of the UCM who demanded treatment for Social Phobia N igual a 71 and Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia N igual a 50. Patients profile was of a woman, young, single and with university studies. The independent variable was the administration of EST for each disorder. The dependent variables were divided into sociodemographic, clinical, treatment and economic factors. A quasi-experimental design has been used for these works, without random assignment and incidental samples. Among people who look for assistance in the clinical practice, social phobia was the most common within the anxiety disorders. The comorbidity was 21 per cent, and the presence of problem in the Axis III or IV rose up to 27 per cent and 60 per cent. The average number of objectives and techniques were 8. 1 and 12. 34. And the mean number of therapy sessions was 35. 70. Considering a single diagnosis, the social phobia 16 sessions, and 15 for the panic disorder with agoraphobia. The factors that explain the longer treatment length were the presence of comorbidity, the number of applied therapeutic techniques and the diagnosis presence such as the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD and the Dysthymia. The psychological treatment is comparable to the pharmacological cost. The results showed that at least 64 per cent of the patients achieved discharged. The effect sizes reached were large d mayor que 1, with changes statistically significant p menor que. 05 after treatment. Psychological length treatment in the clinic does not take much longer than when an action protocol is applied. The utility of generalizing the ETS developed in research setting to a welfare clinic is defended.
