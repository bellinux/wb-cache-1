40|$|Background: The primary {{objective}} was to examine and compare the breast cancer screening adherence rates between black (African American <b>and</b> Afro-Caribbean) <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> (foreign born <b>Hispanic</b> <b>and</b> US-born <b>Hispanic)</b> subpopulations. Methods: Study data was collected in community settings in New York City between the years of 2011 - 2012. Participants (N= 592) were black <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> individuals who attended a breast cancer screening community outreach program. Breast cancer screening rates as well as demographic data were collected. Results: Results revealed that Afro-Caribbean <b>and</b> foreign-born <b>Hispanics</b> are at a greater risk for non-adherence in breast cancer screening compared with African Americans <b>and</b> US-born <b>Hispanics.</b> Conclusions: The majority of breast screening research and community outreach programs categorize people into broad {{racial and ethnic groups}} (e. g., black <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic).</b> The results revealed significant variability within these broader racial/ethnic categories with regard to breast cancer screening. Community outreach programs and future research efforts should target the subpopulations that are at particular risk for breast cancer screening non-adherence...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} effective recruitment and retention initiatives for African American <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> teachers. The research examined recruitment and retention initiatives used by school districts utilizing a survey instrument administered to a sample population of African American <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> teachers within selected school districts in Texas. The sample population of 335 African American <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> teachers was asked to provide their knowledge and perception of recruitment and retention initiatives that were relevant to them in their employment with a school district. The results of the survey instrument were examined for the similarities and differences in the recruitment and retention initiatives for African American <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> teacher populations as perceived by the sample population of teachers. The subjects of this research study were African American <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> teachers employed in school districts with a teacher population of at least seven percent of both African American <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> teachers <b>and</b> a student population of at least 10, 000 students reported to the Texas Education Agency. There were fourteen school districts selected based on this criteria, and four school districts agreed to participate in the study. Based on the findings of the study, the researcher??s recommendations include: (1) The top recruitment initiatives for African American <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> candidates are humanistic factors: contribution to humanity and helping young people. Recruiters should emphasize these areas along with the location of job and financial assistance programs offered by the school districts to improved recruitment. (2) Attention should be given to the establishment of programs that focus on introducing the education profession to students in the middle school and high school settings. (3) Job satisfaction and job security are leading retention initiatives for African American <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> teacher which can be accomplished by improving working conditions and increasing administrative support in a school district. (4) Provide opportunities for increased parental communication, participation and involvement in the school system to help increase retention with African American <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> teachers. (5) Further study could determine if there is a relationship between the effective recruitment and retention initiatives and the years of experience of teachers...|$|R
