40|$|Abstract Background Efforts to {{stem the}} {{diabetes}} epidemic in the United States and other countries {{must take into account}} a complex array of individual, social, economic, and built environmental factors. Increasingly, scientists use information visualization tools to "make sense" of large multivariate data sets. Recently, ring map visualization has been explored as a means of depicting spatially referenced, multivariate data in a single information graphic. A ring map shows multiple attribute data sets as separate rings of information surrounding a base map of a particular geographic region of interest. In this study, ring maps were used to evaluate diabetes prevalence <b>among</b> <b>adult</b> South Carolina Medicaid recipients. In particular, county-level ring maps were used to evaluate disparities in diabetes prevalence <b>among</b> <b>adult</b> African Americans and Whites and to explore potential county-level associations between diabetes prevalence <b>among</b> <b>adult</b> African Americans and five measures of the socioeconomic and built environment—persistent poverty, unemployment, rurality, number of fast food restaurants per capita, and number of convenience stores per capita. Although Medicaid pays for the health care of approximately 15 percent of all diabetics, few studies have examined diabetes in adult Medicaid recipients at the county level. The present study thus addresses a critical information gap, while illustrating the utility of ring maps in multivariate investigations of population health and environmental context. Results Ring maps showed substantial racial disparity in diabetes prevalence <b>among</b> <b>adult</b> Medicaid recipients and suggested an association between adult African American diabetes prevalence and rurality. Rurality was significantly positively associated with diabetes prevalence <b>among</b> <b>adult</b> African American Medicaid recipients in a multivariate statistical model. Conclusions Efforts to reduce diabetes <b>among</b> <b>adult</b> African American Medicaid recipients must extend to rural African Americans. Ring maps can be used to integrate diverse data sets, explore attribute associations, and achieve insights critical to the promotion of population health. </p...|$|R
