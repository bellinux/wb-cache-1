25|$|The matrix {{solution}} {{is mixed with}} the <b>analyte</b> (e.g. protein-sample). A mixture of water and organic solvent allows both hydrophobic and water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules to dissolve into the solution. This {{solution is}} spotted onto a MALDI plate (usually a metal plate designed for this purpose). The solvents vaporize, leaving only the recrystallized matrix, but now with <b>analyte</b> molecules embedded into MALDI crystals. The matrix and the <b>analyte</b> {{are said to be}} co-crystallized. Co-crystallization is a key issue in selecting a proper matrix to obtain a good quality mass spectrum of the <b>analyte</b> of interest.|$|E
25|$|The {{selection}} of a matrix {{is the first step}} when preparing samples for MALDI analysis. The primary goals of the matrix are to absorb the energy from a laser, thus transferring it to the <b>analyte</b> molecules, and to separate the <b>analyte</b> molecules from each other. A consideration that should be taken into account when choosing a matrix is what type of <b>analyte</b> ion is expected or desired. Knowing the acidity or basicity of the <b>analyte</b> molecule compared with the acidity or basicity of the matrix, for example, is valuable knowledge when choosing a matrix. The matrix should not compete with the <b>analyte</b> molecule, so the matrix should not want to form the same type of ion as the <b>analyte.</b> For example, if the desired <b>analyte</b> has a high amount of acidity, it would be logical to choose a matrix with a high amount of basicity to avoid competition and facilitate the formation of an ion. The pH of the matrix {{can also be used to}} select what sample you want to obtain spectra for. For example, in the case of proteins, a very acidic pH can show very little of the peptide components, but can show very good signal for those components that are larger. If the pH is increased towards a more basic pH, then smaller components become easier to see.|$|E

The response of the detector toward different <b>analytes</b> is similar to that in GC-FID and for volatile <b>analytes</b> was comparable to UV detection. However, the responses from involatile <b>analytes,</b> such as amino acids and carbohydrates, were poor and often lower than for a refractive index detector...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{biomolecule}} sensing method that enables sensitive and selective detection of target <b>analytes</b> {{as well as}} simultaneous separation of non-target <b>analytes</b> by utilizing microtubules (MTs) as a molecular carrier and a nanoporous hydrogel membrane (NHM) as a size-based sieve on a microfluidic chip. We functionalized MTs with aptamers, using a streptavidin and biotin linkage, to provide numerous binding sites for specific target <b>analytes.</b> Target <b>analytes</b> captured by the functionalized MTs from a mixture of complex <b>analytes</b> were transported by electrophoresis (EP) and then sieved by the NHM while non-target <b>analytes</b> passed through the NHM {{because of the size}} difference between the <b>analytes</b> and nanopores. Subsequently, the concentration and separation of only target <b>analytes</b> was achieved in a continuous and simultaneous manner because of more rapid transportation of MTs by electric fields. In this study, we demonstrated that our method can be used to detect target <b>analytes</b> at femtomolar levels and enrich the initial concentration by 105 - 10 6 -fold within 10 min in terms of fluorescent signals. We also demonstrated that the method is approximately 10 - 100 times more sensitive than conventional nanobead-based detection methods in the light of fluorescent signals. For unlabeled target <b>analytes</b> in a real sample, the method can provide a means to obtain well purified and concentrated target <b>analytes</b> in the form of pellets for off-chip detection and analysis. Thus, we believe that using aptamer-functionalized MTs in conjunction with an NHM in the presence of electric fields can be widely utilized to facilitate the detection, concentration, and separation of specific biomolecule <b>analytes</b> on a chip. close 0...|$|R

25|$|Normalâ€“phase {{chromatography}} {{was one of}} {{the first}} kinds of HPLC that chemists developed. Also known as normal-phase HPLC (NP-HPLC) this method separates analytes based on their affinity for a polar stationary surface such as silica, hence it is based on <b>analyte</b> ability to engage in polar interactions (such as hydrogen-bonding or dipole-dipole type of interactions) with the sorbent surface. NP-HPLC uses a non-polar, non-aqueous mobile phase (e.g. Chloroform), and works effectively for separating analytes readily soluble in non-polar solvents. The <b>analyte</b> associates with and is retained by the polar stationary phase. Adsorption strengths increase with increased <b>analyte</b> polarity. The interaction strength depends not only on the functional groups present in the structure of the <b>analyte</b> molecule, but also on steric factors. The effect of steric hindrance on interaction strength allows this method to resolve (separate) structural isomers.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} that the internal standard displays very similar (ideally identical) properties, with respect to detector response (i.e. ionisation), as the <b>analyte</b> of interest. To simplify the selection of internal standard, most laboratories use an analogous stable isotope in an isotope dilution type analysis. The stable isotope is almost guaranteed to be chemically and physically {{as close as possible to}} the <b>analyte</b> of interest, hence producing an almost identical detector response in addition to behaving identically during sample preparation and chromatographic resolution. To this end, the ion suppression experienced by both the <b>analyte</b> and the internal standard should be identical. It {{is important}} to note that an excessively high concentration of stable isotope internal standard may cause ion suppression itself, since it will co-elute with the <b>analyte</b> of interest. Hence, the internal standard should be added at an appropriate concentration.|$|E
25|$|To {{choose the}} matrix for each solid <b>analyte,</b> three {{criteria}} must be considered. First, it should dissolve the solid compound to be analysed (with {{or without the}} aid of a cosolvent or additive), thus allowing molecules of that compound to diffuse to the surface layers, replenishing the sample molecules that have been ionized or destroyed by interaction with the fast atom beam. It {{should also be noted that}} another mechanism for explanation of ion formation in FAB involves the idea that sputtering occurs from the bulk rather than the surface, but in that case, the solubility is still largely important to insure homogeneity of solid <b>analyte</b> in the bulk solution. Secondly, the matrix should have a low volatility under the conditions of the mass spectrometer. As mentioned above, as the matrix is depleted, the ionization decreases as well, so maintaining the matrix is vital. Thirdly, the matrix should not react with the solid <b>analyte</b> in question, or if it does react, it should be in an understood and reproducible way. This ensures reproducibility of analysis and identification of the actual <b>analyte</b> rather than a derivative of the <b>analyte.</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Cobas 6000 (Roche, Germany) is {{biochemistry}} analyzer for spectrophotometric, immu-noturbidimetric and ion-selective {{determination of}} biochemical <b>analytes.</b> Hereby we present analytical validation {{with emphasis on}} method performance judgment for routine operation. Materials and methods: Validation was made for 30 <b>analytes</b> (metabolites, enzymes, trace ele-ments, specific proteins and electrolytes). Research included determination of within-run (N = 20) and between-run imprecision (N = 30), inaccuracy (N = 30) and method comparison with routine analyzer (Beckman Coulter AU 640) (N = 50). For validation of complete analytical process we calculated total error (TE). Results were judged according to quality specification criteria given by European Working Group. Results: Within-run imprecision CVs were all below 5 % except for cholesterol, triglycerides, IgA and IgM. Between-run CVs for all <b>analytes</b> were below 10 %. <b>Analytes</b> that {{did not meet the}} required speci-fications for imprecision were: total protein, albumin, calcium, sodium, chloride, immunoglobulins and HDL cholesterol. <b>Analytes</b> that did not fulfill requirements for inaccuracy were: total protein, calcium, sodium and chloride. <b>Analytes</b> that deviated from quality specifications for total error were: total pro-tein, albumin, calcium, sodium, chloride and IgM. Passing-Bablok regression analysis provided linear equation and 95 % confidence interval for intercept and slope. Complete accordance with routine ana-lyzer Beckman Coulter AU 640 showed small number of <b>analytes.</b> Other <b>analytes</b> showed small pro-portional and/or small constant difference and therefore need to be adjusted for routine operation. Conclusions: Regarding low CV values, tested analyzer has satisfactory accuracy and precision and is extremely stable.

25|$|Using matrix matched {{calibration}} standards can compensate for ion suppression. Using this technique, {{calibration standards}} are prepared in identical sample matrix {{to that used}} for analysis (e.g. plasma) by spiking a normal sample with known concentrations of <b>analyte.</b> This is not always possible for biological samples, since the <b>analyte</b> of interest is often endogenously present in a clinically significant, albeit normal, quantity. For matrix matched calibration standards {{to be effective in}} compensating for ion suppression, the sample matrix must be free of the <b>analyte</b> of interest. Additionally, it is important that there is little variation in test sample composition since both the test sample and the prepared calibration sample must be affected in the same way by ion suppression.
