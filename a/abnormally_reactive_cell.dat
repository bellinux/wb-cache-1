40|$|An {{autoimmune}} mechanism {{has been}} invoked {{in a number}} of disease states, such as the connective tissue diseases (1, 2), chronic thyroiditis (3, 4), hemolytic anemia (5), and other conditions (6). It has been suggested that the lesions of autoimmune disease result from an immunological reaction between abnormal lymphoid cells and host tissues (1). Regardless of the mechanism whereby such <b>abnormally</b> <b>reactive</b> <b>cells</b> may arise, it is possible to study the consequences of their presence by providing the experimental animal with immunologically competent cells capable of reacting with antigens of the new host. This experimental situation is achieved in the animal with homologous disease, in which there is immunologic interaction between homologous lymphoid cells and host antigens. Homologous disease is, in fact, known to be characterized by changes which resemble certain features of human connective disease. Oliner, Schwartz, and Dameshek (7) have called attention to the similarity of the hematological abnormalities of homologous disease to those of human disease.

40|$|In {{previous}} reports, homologous {{disease in}} the adult rat has been presented {{as a model for}} autoimmune disease in man. In preliminary reports, (1, 2) the polyarthrifis, cardiac lesions, and changes in the skin observed in this condition have been reported. The cutaneous lesions (3) have been described in detail and evidence presented that they have an immunologic basis. The present paper deals with the findings in the joints, heart, kidney, and reficuloendothellal system. In the joints, an acute migratory polyarthrifis and in the heart a high incidence of valvular and myocardial inflammatory lesions have been observed. In {{view of the fact that}} the animal with homologous disease contains lymphoid cells capable of reacting with host antigens, and therefore resembles a host with <b>abnormally</b> <b>reactive</b> lymphoid <b>cells,</b> these changes together with the skin lesions observed appear to be of particular significance. That homologous disease may be a model for human autoimmune disease has been previously postulated by Oliner, Schwartz, and Dameshek (4).

40|$|Hodgkin's disease (HD) shows rare {{neoplastic}} Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells {{embedded in}} an abundant reactive infiltrate containing, among other cell types, neutrophilic granulocytes. Interleukin (IL) - 8 is chemotactic for neutrophils. The expression of IL- 8 was tested by {{in situ hybridization}} with 35 S-labeled IL- 8 -specific RNA probes on 38 cases of HD. Reactive lesions, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of B and T phenotype, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis served as controls. IL- 8 expression was observed in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells in 3 of 33 cases of classical HD and in <b>reactive</b> <b>cells</b> in 20 of 33 HD cases as evidenced by combined isotopic in situ hybridization and immunohistology for the demonstration of cell-type-characteristic antigens or enzyme histochemistry for chloroacetate esterase. IL- 8 -positive cells were more numerous in cases of nodular sclerosing HD {{as compared with the}} mixed cellularity histotype (P = 0. 01). The number of IL- 8 -positive cells and the density of neutrophils were positively correlated (P < 0. 01). In 5 cases of lymphocyte-predominant HD, IL- 8 expression was not displayed. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases contained IL- 8 transcripts only in 1 of 23 cases in sparse <b>reactive</b> <b>cells.</b> In 4 of 7 cases of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, IL- 8 -specific signals were displayed in S 100 -negative cells.

40|$|Selected {{populations of}} thymus-derived (T) rat {{lymphocytes}} having specific immunological reactivity to chosen histocompatibility (H) alloantigens are {{found among the}} cellular products of the mixed lymphocyte interaction (MLI).

When the surviving cells from this lymphocyte-antigen interaction are transferred into thymectomized, X-irradiated, marrow-reconstituted syngeneic recipients (B rats) which lack detectable T-lymphocyte functions, the lymphocyte populations subsequently recovered from the hosts possess the capacity to react in the MLI and in the graft-vs. -host (GVH) reaction, and the reactions have specificity for the original priming alloantigens.

Attempts were made to isolate and further characterize the reactive membrane material. Pepain digests of crude membrane preparations from the surface <b>reactive</b> <b>cell</b> lines were capable of blocking the direct membrane fluorescence reaction while the digest obtained from the non-reactive line demonstrated no blocking activity. Gel filtered and papain digested membrane material, from all three cell lines, produced similar elution curves when rechromatographed on a calibrated Sephadex G- 150 column.

40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} the immunohistochemical expression of CD 31 (JC 70) in normal and neoplastic plasma cells. METHODS: Plasma cells in bone marrow biopsies and extramedullary locations were examined. All extramedullary biopsies were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. The bone marrow biopsies were fixed in formal acetic acid and embedded in paraffin wax. Twenty multiple myelomas (12 bone marrow and eight extramedullary deposits), 10 extramedullary plasmacytomas, and 30 biopsies with <b>reactive</b> plasma <b>cells</b> (10 bone marrow, 20 extramedullary biopsies) were stained with anti-CD 31 (JC 70) using the streptavidin-biotin detection system with diaminobenzidine as a chromogen.

Normal red cell hexokinase was demonstrated to be dependent on glucose for maintenance of activity after heating to 45 °C. The cells of the proposita are unable to utilize glucose efficiently at glucose concentrations lower than 0. 2 mmole/liter whereas normal cells maintain linear glucose consumption to at least 0. 05 mM glucose.

40|$|International audienceEvidence {{suggests}} that dynamic and bidirectional feedback processes between cancer cells and a complex network of <b>reactive</b> <b>cells</b> in their microenvironment {{play a critical}} role during different developmental stages of most malignancies and their progression. This network consists of a heterogeneous group of cells, including macrophages, follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), follicular reticular cells (FRCs), fibroblasts and endothelial cells, with further complexity being added by the extracellular matrix scaffolding. Lymphomas are malignant neoplasms composed of monoclonal proliferations of lymphocytes, which proliferate autonomously and uncontrollably, overrunning the normal lymphocytic population. Most lymphomas occur within lymphoid organs, - such as lymph nodes, spleen and the mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) -, where complex cell-cell interactions normally take place during the immune response. Although various <b>reactive</b> <b>cell</b> populations have long been suspected of contributing to lymphoma outcome, recent gene expression array data has emphasised the role of the various components of microenvironment.
