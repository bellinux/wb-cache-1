40|$|For linear wave {{propagation}} in anisotropic media, {{the principle of}} superposition still holds. The decomposition of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>dipole</b> log is based on this principle. In the forward decomposition inline and crossline <b>acoustic</b> <b>dipole</b> logs at any azimuthal angle the projection of measurements is along the principal direction of the formation. In the inverse decomposition the measurements along the principal direction can be constructed from the orthogonal pair of inline and crossline <b>acoustic</b> <b>dipole</b> log. The analytic formulas for both forward and inverse decompositions of the dipole laaa sss-saog are derived in this paper. The inverse decomposition formula is the solution in the least-square sense. Numerical examples are demonstrated for the <b>acoustic</b> <b>dipole</b> log decomposition in isotropic and anisotropic formations. The synthetic dipole log is calculated by the 3 -D finite difference method. The numerical examples also show that the inverse decomposition formula works very well with noisy data. This inverse decomposition formula will be useful to process the field acoustic logging data in anisotropic formations. It can provide {{the direction of the}} formation anisotropy as well as the degree of anisotropy. Because <b>acoustic</b> <b>dipole</b> logging is in the near field distance, the particle motion is complicated. The particle motion is linearly polarized only in the principle direction.

40|$|We derive {{expressions}} for {{the spectral}} emissivity and absorptivity of acoustic radiation by low Mach number (M ≪ 1) turbulent fluids. The emissivity and absorptivity {{depend on the}} manner in which the turbulence is excited. We consider three types of turbulence. The first is free turbulence, that is, turbulence which is not subject to external forces. The second and third examples are special cases of forced turbulence, turbulence maintained by stirring with spoons and turbulent pseudoconvection. Acoustic quadrupoles are the lowest order acoustic multipoles present in free turbulence, and they control both its emissivity and absorptivity. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>dipoles</b> are created in forced turbulence, and they enhance the acoustic emissivity by M^(- 2) compared to that of free turbulence. The acoustic absorptivity of forced turbulence is quite subtle. The absorptivity of turbulence which is maintained by stirring is dominated by <b>acoustic</b> <b>dipoles</b> and exceeds that of free turbulence by M^(- 2). The dipole absorptivity of turbulent pseudoconvection is reduced by M^ 2 below that of turbulence maintained by stirring. Thus, the absorptivity of turbulent pseudoconvection is no larger than that of free turbulence. We apply our results to estimate the equilibrium energies of the acoustic modes in a box filled with fluid some of which is turbulent. For both free turbulence and turbulence maintained by stirring, the most highly excited acoustic modes attain energies E Mv^ 2, where M and v are the typical mass and velocity of an energy bearing eddy. The quality factors, or Q's, of the modes are larger by M^(- 2) in the former case than in the latter. For turbulent pseudoconvection, the most energetic acoustic modes have equilibrium energies E Mc^ 2, where c is the sound speed. Their Q's are comparable to those of modes in equilibrium with free turbulence. We evaluate the scattering of acoustic radiation by turbulent fluids. For all types of turbulence, the scattering opacity is smaller by M^ 3 than the absorptive opacity for frequencies near the peak of the acoustic spectrum. Radiation scattered by free turbulence and turbulent pseudoconvection suffers frequency shifts Δω ω. The frequency shifts are much smaller, Δω Mω, for radiation scattered by turbulence maintained by stirring. We investigate the rate at which nonlinear interactions transfer energy among the acoustic modes. If all of the fluid in the box is turbulent, this rate is slower, by M^ 3 for free turbulence, by M^ 5 for turbulence maintained by stirring, and by M for turbulent pseudoconvection, than the rate at which the individual acoustic modes exchange energy with the turbulence. If only a small portion of the fluid is turbulent, the nonlinear mode interactions can be significant, especially for modes in equilibrium with turbulent pseudoconvection. Our results have potential applications to the acoustic radiation in regions of extended turbulence which often arise in nature. In particular, they should prove useful in understanding the excitation of solar oscillations...|$|R

40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the accuracy}} of numerical Time-Reversal (TR) simulations implemented using two different Time-Reversal Mirror (TRM) configurations for localising and characterising a stationary <b>acoustic</b> <b>dipole</b> source in a mean flow. The forward time evolution of the acoustic fields is simulated {{by means of the}} numerical solution of the inhomogeneous 2 -D Linearised Euler Equations (LEE) with uniform subsonic mean flow. Only the acoustic pressure is recorded with two line arrays (LAs) of boundary nodes in a TRM corresponding to the top and bottom boundaries. The time-reversed acoustic pressure history is used as input data for simulating two numerical TR experiments; (a) one line array (LA) in a TRM corresponding to the top boundary and (b) two LAs in a TRM corresponding to the top and bottom boundaries. The Root-Mean-Square (RMS) of the time-reversed acoustic pressure field obtained by the first experiment indicates only one spatial maxima region (focal spot), therefore incorrectly suggests that the source is a monopole, whereas the second experiment correctly reveals the source to be a dipole. The local acoustic pressure history at two source locations is shown to be coherent with relative phase exactly equal to  radian, thereby confirming the dipole source nature. This demonstrates that two LAs in a TRM located on either sides of the mean flow are required to take into consideration, the complete phase information and thereby accurately characterise a dipole.

40|$|Sound {{generated}} by impacting structures is of considerable importance in noise control. Sound is {{generated by}} a vibrating structure by inducing pressure fluctuations in the surrounding medium. Impact induced noise is the sound generated by a vibrating structure subjected to motion constraint. In such problems one has to study the vibration behavior of the oscillator, the impact mechanics, and the emanating acoustic field dynamics. A literature review carried out points {{to the fact that}} though there has been considerable work on vibration behavior of impact oscillators and the acoustics of impact of rigid masses, there is very little work reported on the sound generated due to vibration and impact. This thesis couples vibration analysis of oscillators undergoing impact with its acoustic behavior. The vibration behavior is nonlinear on account of the impact. Therefore the vibration analysis as well as the resulting acoustic field analysis has to be in the time-domain. This investigation is concerned with the effect of structural dynamics, impact dynamics, and acoustic field boundary conditions, on the sound pressure generated due to vibration and impact. We have considered a single degree of freedom as well as a flexible Euler-Bernoulli beam vibration model. The former is the simplest for studying vibro-acoustic response. The numerical model of the beam is derived using the finite element method resulting in a finite dimensional system with more than one degree of freedom. The dynamics of each degree of freedom are distinct in terms of amplitude and phase and are a function of the nature of linear dependence on other degrees of freedom and the nature of excitation. An impacting beam introduces interesting interactions between the dynamics of the degrees of freedom as a consequence of nonlinearity due to the motion constraint. The impact of the oscillator mass with a barrier is modeled using a simple coefficient of restitution model based on Hertzian contact theory. There is velocity reversal on contact with the barrier. The contact force is finite acting within a finite interval of time. The contact force is assumed to vary in time during the contact interval. This effectively models contact as linearly elastic. The pressure perturbation due to vibration of the oscillator mass is shown equivalent to the pressure perturbation due to an <b>acoustic</b> <b>dipole.</b> The <b>acoustic</b> <b>dipole</b> is placed at the equilibrium position of the vibrating mass. The dipole pressure is then a function of motion of the oscillator. In the case of a single degree of freedom oscillator the dipole axis is along the direction of motion. The sound pressure due to a vibrating beam is modeled as an array of acoustic dipoles placed at the finite element nodes of the beam and stationary at the beam's static equilibrium configuration. The dipole axis is once again aligned with the direction of vibration of the beam that is transverse to the beam neutral axis. Anechoic as well as perfectly reflecting acoustic boundary conditions are simulated in the time-domain. The resulting governing equation of motion of the single degree freedom oscillator as well as the beam are integrated numerically in time to compute its response. The acoustic pressure is shown to be critically dependent on the excitation frequency of the oscillator, dynamic properties of the oscillator, coefficient of restitution of impact and impact dynamics, and acoustic field boundary conditions...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} a weak sound {{radiating}} cell is proposed to reduce the low frequency radiated noise from structures. The cell consists of two coupled surfaces such that, when placed on a vibrating structure, {{the responses of the}} two surfaces are nearly out-of-phase and of equal strength over a wide frequency range. This structure response leads the cell to behave as an <b>acoustic</b> <b>dipole</b> and thus as a poor sound radiating source. The control of low frequency structurally radiated noise is then achieved by covering the structure with an array of these weak radiating cells, i. e. surface treatment. Thus, the surface treatment essentially transforms the response of the structure to that of a distributed array of dipoles yielding a low sound radiating structure. Theoretical models are developed to predict the performance of the cell. Experimental verification is performed for a single cell applied to a piston-like structure to demonstrate the concept on a simple radiating structure. The results demonstrated an overall sound power level reduction of 5. 2 dB between 400 - 1600 Hz with maximum reductions over 30 dB at discrete frequencies. Finally, an array of weak radiating cells is experimentally applied to a more complex structure, a rectangular plate. The results of the plate experiments reveal an overall sound power level reduction of 10. 2 dB between 100 - 1600 Hz with maximum reductions of 25 dB at discrete frequencies. These results demonstrate the potential of the weak radiating cell concept to reduce low frequency structurally radiated noise.

While we are aware that macrofractures augment the elastic wave velocity during routine acoustic profiling (e.g., Barton and Zoback [1992]), our laboratory data show that although samples containing mesofractures (i.e., on the sample scale) are shifted to higher permeabilities and elastic wave velocities, they do not stray too far away from the trend extrapolated from our power-law relationship. Despite this, we urge a certain degree of caution, based on the potential presence of large-scale fractures, when estimating permeability using our derived permeability-elastic wave velocity relationship.|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the propagation of}} flexural waves in a borehole surrounded by an azimuthally anisotropic hard formation, we made an ultrasonic borehole model of Delabole slate with very strong anisotropy. The axial and azimuthal acoustic fields generated by a dipole source were measured in the fluid-filled borehole. The results show {{that there are three}} dominant wave modes: fast and slow flexural waves and one we call a "flexural Stoneley wave. The phase velocities of the fast and slow flexural waves are lower than and close to those of the fast and slow shear waves of the formation, respectively. The phase velocity of the "flexural Stoneley" wave is higher than that of the borehole fluid. Regardless of the polarization of the dipole source, the particle motions of the fast and slow flexural waves are linear and {{in the direction of the}} fast and slow shear waves, respectively. The "flexural Stoneley" wave, similar to the normal Stoneley wave generated by a monopole source, is a tube wave with low frequency and high amplitude.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis is}} developed {{for control of}} wake-airfoil interaction noise {{by the use of}} actuators on the airfoil surfaces near the leading edge. The objective is to eliminate the sound radiation by canceling the wake-airfoil noise near its source (the leading edge). Actuators are mounted on the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil and driven out of phase to match the antisymmetric nature of the wake-airfoil noise field. The analysis is based on linearization about a two-dimensional compressible subsonic mean flow past a semi-infinite flat-plate airfoil. Asymptotic solutions are developed for the unsteady boundary-layer flow over surface-mounted actuators which are long compared to the triple-deck scale. The analysis shows that boundary layer effects {{play a significant role in}} determining the acoustic field, and that traditional approaches used to account for acoustically thin boundary layers are not always adequate. In addition to the acoustic monopole field associated with the actuator volume flux, <b>acoustic</b> monopole and <b>dipole</b> fields are produced at leading order by deflection of the boundary layer into the oncoming free stream. For a specified actuator size and location (relative to the leading edge), the analysis determines the actuator amplitude and phase which minimizes the total sound radiation. The cancellation is most effective when the directivity pattern for the control field closely matches that for the wake-airfoil noise field. At low Mach numbers, this is achieved by mounting the actuators sufficiently close to the leading edge. At high subsonic Mach numbers, the sound cancellation that can be achieved with a single actuator on each surface is limited by mismatch in the directivity patterns.

Second, the fast shear direction is estimated from the cross-dipole waveforms. It corresponds to {{the direction of the}} maximum horizontal stress (S[subscript H]). Finally, a multi-frequency inversion of both the Stoneley and flexural dispersions yields the maximum (S[subscript H]) and minimum (S[subscript h]) horizontal stress magnitudes together with the three formation nonlinear elastic constants, C[subscript 111], C[subscript 112] and C[subscript 113], defined about the selected reference (isotropic) state. The inversion method is based on equations that relate S[subscript H] and S[subscript h] with variations in phase velocities of the borehole flexural and Stoneley waves in the stressed state from those in the assumed reference state, the state that is hydrostatically loaded and isotropic. Phase velocities of the borehole flexural and Stoneley modes as a function of frequency can be obtained from processing the cross-dipole and monopole waveforms, respectively. The borehole flexural and Stoneley dispersions in the assumed reference (isotropic) state are obtained from the solution of a standard boundary-value problem. The sensitivity functions for the inversion model are obtained from the eigenfunctions of the boundary-value problem in the reference state. Results for the stress directions and magnitudes obtained from the inversion of the Stoneley and flexural dispersions over a selected bandwidth are consistent with focal mechanism and borehole breakout data present in the world map database (Zoback, 1992).

40|$|Borehole {{acoustic}} logging-while-drilling (LWD) for formation evaluation {{has become}} an indispensable part of hydrocarbon reservoir assessment (Tang et al., 2002; Cittá et al., 2004; Esmersoy et al., 2005). However, the detection of acoustic formation arrivals 1 over tool mode contamination has been a challenging problem in acoustic LWD technology. This is because the tool mode contamination in LWD is more severe than in wireline tools in most geological environments (Tang et al., 2002; Huang, 2003). In this {{paper we propose a}} new method for separating tool waves from formation acoustic waves in acoustic LWD. This method is to measure the seismoelectric 2 signal excited by the LWD acoustic waves. The acoustic waves propagating along the borehole or in the formation can induce electric fields. The generated electric field is localized around the wave pulses and carried along the borehole at the formation acoustic wave velocity. The LWD tool waves which propagate along the rigid tool rim can not excite any electric signal. This is due to the effectively grounding of the drill string during the LWD process makes it impossible to accumulate any excess charge at the conductive tool – borehole fluid interface. Therefore, there should be no contribution by the tool modes to the recorded seismoelectric signals. In this study, we designed the laboratory experiments to collect simulated LWD monopole and <b>dipole</b> <b>acoustic</b> and seismoelectric signals in a borehole in sandstone. By analyzing the acoustic and electric signals, we can observe the difference between them, which are the mainly tool modes and noise. Then we calculate the similarity of the two signals to pick out the common components of the acoustic and seismoelectric signals, which are the pure formation modes. Using the seismoelectric signals as reference, we could filter out the tool modes. The method works well. To theoretically understand the seismoelectric conversion in the LWD geometry, we also calculate the synthetic waveforms for the multipole LWD seismoelectric signals based on Pride’s theory (Pride, 1994). The synthetic waveforms for the electric field induced by the LWD-acoustic-wave along the borehole wall demonstrate the absence of the tool mode, which is consistent with the conclusions we get in the experimental study...|$|R
