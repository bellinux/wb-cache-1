Harpole defended the city's decision at the time, saying, [...] "They looked at everything they could to say <b>are</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> reasonable, can they perform and [...] have they been honest in their past dealings. Every one of these (documents) says to move ahead".|$|E
500|$|Following {{its home}} video release, [...] "I'm with Cupid" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. In 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed Elton John's performance {{as one of}} the thirty-three funniest cameos {{in the history of the}} show. James Plath of DVD Town wrote that the episode is [...] "funny" [...] because [...] "it has a plot we recognize from our own lives," [...] and Jake McNeill of Digital Entertainment News considered it to be one of the season's best episodes. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide gave the episode a positive review as well, calling it [...] "Very, very clever and funny," [...] and wrote [...] "it's executed stylishly and Homer wins in the end; entirely by default of course, but maybe that's his reward for not falling off the skywriting plane until the last minute!" [...] However, they also criticized the episode for being [...] "a little tacky," [...] writing [...] "After all, how nice <b>are</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> who want to ruin Apu and Manjula's day just because they're scared of looking bad?" ...|$|E
500|$|In Italy, {{the band}} {{performed}} the song at the 2012 Sanremo Music Festival on 14 February 2012. In France, they performed [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] and [...] "One Thing" [...] on Le Grand Journal on 22 February 2012. In the United States, One Direction performed the song along with [...] "More than This" [...] and [...] "One Thing" [...] {{for the first}} time on The Today Show at the Rockefeller Center on 12 March 2012. An estimated 15,000 fans descended on the plaza. Melissa Lonner, senior entertainment producer for The Today Show, said: [...] "One Direction is relatively unknown with no hits yet. They basically exploded, and all the adults are saying, 'Who <b>are</b> <b>these</b> <b>people,</b> and how do they know about it?'". They also performed the song at the 2012 Kids' Choice Awards on 31 March 2012. One Direction performed [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] and [...] "One Thing" [...] on the NBC comedy television show Saturday Night Live on 7 April 2012, and also appeared in a comedy sketch with Sofía Vergara. In Australia, they performed [...] "One Thing" [...] and [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] at the 54th Logie Awards, where they also presented an award for [...] "Most Popular New Female Talent" [...] on 15 April 2012. On 12 August 2012, One Direction performed [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in London, which represented the handover to Rio de Janeiro as the host of the 2016 Summer Olympics. It was included on the set list of the group's headlining sold-out show at Madison Square Garden on 3 December 2012. One Direction performed the song on two of their major concert tours: Up All Night Tour (2011–12) and Take Me Home Tour (2013).|$|E

25|$|It <b>was</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> after {{whom the}} {{thoroughfare}} was named. The Bugis, or Buginese, also put their sailing skills to less benign uses and {{gained a reputation}} {{in the region as}} a race of bloodthirsty pirates.|$|R

2500|$|Connolly's The Big Yin {{nickname}} {{was first}} used during his adolescent years to differentiate between himself and his father. [...] "My father {{was a very strong}} man. Broad and strong. He had an 18½-inch neck collar. Huge, like a bull. He was [...] "Big Billy" [...] and I was [...] "Wee Billy". And then I got bigger than him, and the whole thing got out of control. And then I became The Big Yin in Scotland. So, we'd go into the pub and someone would say, 'Billy Connolly was in.' 'Oh? Big Billy or Wee Billy?' 'The Big Yin.' 'Oh, Wee Billy.' If you were a stranger, you'd think, 'What <b>are</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> talking about?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Some reviewers were unfavorable. One {{complaint}} {{was that the}} movie's pacing was too slow; while {{this may have been}} intended to convey a dream state, critics objected that it made actions and decisions seem labored. Another {{complaint was}} that since Kubrick shot the scenes set in New York City on a sound stage, the result was that they felt inauthentic. In The Washington Post, Stephen Hunter wrote, [...] "Kubrick is annoyingly offhand {{while at the same time}} grindingly pedantic; plot points are made over and over again, things are explained till the dawn threatens to break in the east, and the movie stumbles along at a glacial pace." [...] David Edelstein of Slate dismissed it as [...] "estranged from any period I recognize. Who <b>are</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> played by Cruise and Kidman, who act as if no one has ever made a pass at them and are so deeply traumatized by their newfound knowledge of sexual fantasies--the kind that mainstream culture absorbed at least half a century ago? [...] Who are these aristocrats whose limos take them to secret masked orgies in Long Island mansions? Even dream plays need some grounding in the real world." [...] J. Hoberman wrote that the film [...] "feels like a rough draft at best." ...|$|E

60|$|She {{was aware}} of people who passed around her, not as persons, but as looming presences. It was very {{difficult}} for her to adjust herself.

60|$|FINDING {{the society}} at Loohooloo very pleasant, the young ladies, in particular, being {{extremely}} sociable; and, moreover, {{in love with}} the famous good cheer of old Marharvai, we acquiesced in an invitation of his to tarry a few days longer. We might then, he said, join a small canoe party which was going to a place a league or two distant. So averse to all exertion <b>are</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> that they really thought the prospect of thus getting rid of a few miles' walking would prevail with us, even if there were no other inducement.|$|E

60|$|A {{glance at}} the {{countryside}} conjures up a picture of extensive tracts being cultivated on a wholesale scale, of skilled men directing great ploughing, sowing, and reaping plants, steering cattle and sheep about carefully designed enclosures, constructing channels and guiding sewage towards its proper destination on the fields, and then of added crowds of genial people coming out to spray trees and plants, pick and sort and pack fruits. But who <b>are</b> <b>these</b> <b>people?</b> Why are they in particular doing this for the community? Is our Great State still to have a majority of people glad to do commonplace work for mediocre wages, and will there be other individuals who will ride by on the roads, sympathetically, no doubt, but with a secret sense of superiority? So one opens the general problem of the organisation for labour.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's this way. There are {{all sorts}} of laws about the places, but any one who wants can get round them as easy as falling off a log. The law says a {{tenement}} house is a building occupied by more than two families. Well, when there's a fuss, all the man has to do is to clear out all the families but two. Then, when the inspector fellow comes along, and says, let's say, 'Where's your running water on each floor? That's what the law says you've got to have, and here <b>are</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> having to go downstairs and out of doors to fetch their water supplies,' the landlord simply replies, 'Nothing doing. This isn't a tenement house at all. There are only two families here.' And when the fuss has blown over, back come the rest of the crowd, and things go on the same as before." ...|$|E

What is it what THEY think, {{what they}} reckon, what they plan out, and what they set {{themselves}} against--to us? We love each other, we belong to each other, without their help or their hindrance. From the time we first saw each other it was so, and from that time Paw and Maw, and Seth and Masters, and even YOU and ME, dear, had nothing else to do. That was love as I know it; not Seth's sneaking rages, and Uncle Ben's sneaking fooleries, and Masters's sneaking conceit, but only love. And knowing that, I let Seth rage, and Uncle Ben dawdle, and Masters trifle--and for what? To keep them from me and my boy. They were satisfied, and we were happy." ...|$|E

"I admit that," [...] Pollio said, [...] "and though, since Nero {{came to the}} throne, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in these gladiatorial displays, methinks there are fewer now than {{in the days before the}} Empire, when Spartacus led twenty thousand gladiators against Rome. There is one thing, if the creed of those Jews of whom Norbanus was speaking to you ever comes to be the dominant religion, there will be an end to the arena, for so averse <b>are</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> to fighting, that when placed in the arena they will not make even an effort to defend themselves. They do not, as do the Goths sometimes, lower their swords and fall on the points. Suicide they consider wrong, and simply wait calmly like sheep to be killed. I have been talking with some friends over the persecutions of two years ago, just after I left for Britain, and they say it was wonderful to see the calmness with which the Christians meet death. They say the persecution was given up simply because the people became sick of spectacles in which there was no interest or excitement. Well, Beric, are you ready to go out with me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Is there, however, an all-round {{inferior}} {{race in the}} world? Even the Australian black-fellow is, perhaps, {{not quite}} so entirely eligible for extinction as a good, wholesome, horse-racing, sheep-farming Australian white may think. These queer little races, the black-fellows, the Pigmies, the Bushmen, may have their little gifts, a greater keenness, a greater fineness of this sense or that, a quaintness of the imagination or what not, that may serve as their little unique addition to the totality of our Utopian civilisation. We are supposing that every individual alive on earth is alive in Utopia, and so all the surviving [...] "black-fellows" [...] are there. Every {{one of them in}} Utopia has had what none have had on earth, a fair education and fair treatment, justice, and opportunity. Suppose that the common idea is right about the general inferiority of these people, then it would follow that in Utopia most of them are childless, and working at or about the minimum wage, and some will have passed out of all possibility of offspring under the hand of the offended law; but still--cannot we imagine some few of these little people--whom you must suppose neither naked nor clothed in the European style, but robed in the Utopian fashion--may have found some delicate art to practise, some peculiar sort of carving, for example, that justifies God in creating them? Utopia has sound sanitary laws, sound social laws, sound economic laws; what harm <b>are</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> going to do? ...|$|E

Fairburn's shop knows him no more; not only has Knight disappeared from Sweeting's Alley, but, as we are given to understand, Sweetings Alley has disappeared {{from the face of}} the globe. Slop, the atrocious Castlereagh, the sainted Caroline (in a tight pelisse, with feathers in her head), the [...] "Dandy of sixty," [...] who used to glance at us from Hone's friendly windows--where are they? Mr. Cruikshank may have drawn a thousand better things since the days when these were; but they are to us a thousand times more pleasing than anything else he has done. How we used to believe in them! to stray miles out of the way on holidays, in order to ponder for an hour before that delightful window in Sweeting's Alley! in walks through Fleet Street, to vanish abruptly down Fairburn's passage, and there make one at his [...] "charming gratis" [...] exhibition. There used to be a crowd round the window in those days, of grinning, good-natured mechanics, who spelt the songs, and spoke them out for the benefit of the company, and who received the points of humor with a general sympathizing roar.
