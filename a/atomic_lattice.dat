2500|$|In November 2002, {{after the}} {{completion}} of the mission's only encounter with Jupiter's moon Amalthea, problems with playback of the tape recorder again plagued Galileo. About 10 minutes after the closest approach of the Amalthea flyby, Galileo stopped collecting data, shut down all of its instruments, and went into safe mode, apparently as a result of exposure to Jupiter's intense radiation environment. Though most of the Amalthea data was already written to tape, {{it was found that the}} recorder refused to respond to commands telling it to play back data. After weeks of troubleshooting of an identical flight spare of the recorder on the ground, it was determined that the cause of the malfunction was a reduction of light output in three infrared Optek OP133 light-emitting diodes located in the drive electronics of the recorder's motor encoder wheel. The GaAs LEDs had been particularly sensitive to proton-irradiation-induced <b>atomic</b> <b>lattice</b> displacement defects, which greatly decreased their effective light output and caused the drive motor's electronics to falsely believe the motor encoder wheel was incorrectly positioned. Galileo flight team then began a series of [...] "annealing" [...] sessions, where current was passed through the LEDs for hours at a time to heat them to a point where some of the crystalline lattice defects would be shifted back into place, thus increasing the LED's light output. After about 100 hours of annealing and playback cycles, the recorder was able to operate for up to an hour at a time. After many subsequent playback and cooling cycles, the complete transmission back to Earth of all recorded Amalthea flyby data was successful.|$|E

40|$|It is well {{understood}} that defects adversely affect the electro-mechanical properties of materials. Ideally, defect compositions of device materials could be measured, but present {{technology in the}} field of atomic defect detection is either destructive in nature, or is unable to determine the precise atomic composition of materials. In the adjacent field of damage detection in large-scale truss networks, algorithms based on spectral measurements have successfully been employed to locate damaged members. Already similar principles have been applied to material lattices experimentally by using Raman Spectroscopy to qualitatively approximate defect densities within materials. However, the applications have largely been limited to surface defects or two-dimensional materials, and the host lattices and defect types are primarily studied anecdotally. This thesis details a numerical method for determining the precise phonon or vibration spectra of material lattices with defects. The dynamical matrices of lattices containing defects are calculated by introducing defects systematically into the dynamical matrices of pristine, defect-free lattices using linear operators. Each operation modifies or removes an individual bond or interaction. Complex defect configurations can be composed through reiterative application of the operators. The proposed methods may be applied to systems containing any interaction type or bond order, including space trusses and <b>atomic</b> <b>lattices.</b> The method is demonstrated by numerically determining the convergence rate of phonon properties in the dilute limit of a single point vacancy. Then the same methodology is applied to two-dimensional <b>atomic</b> <b>lattices</b> with central forces, two-dimension truss networks with distributed mass, as well as three-dimensional <b>atomic</b> <b>lattices</b> with non-linear many body potentials. In each example, the defect structure and properties are shown to alter the spectral properties of the materials...|$|R

40|$|We {{found that}} the major {{assumption}} of the Lorentz – Lorenz theory about uniformity of local fields in dense material does not hold in finite groups of atoms. Selfinteraction of <b>atomic</b> <b>lattices</b> results in the uniformity being broken at sub-wavelength scale. The system then exhibits strong sub-wavelength stratification of local field and dipole polarization due to nanoscale excitation of so called “locsitons”, which give rise to size-related resonances and related large field enhancement in finite <b>atomic</b> <b>lattices.</b> At certain “magic ” numbers of atoms in the array, the system may exhibit self-induced cancellation of resonant local-field suppression. In a 2 D case, a similar effect gives rise to “magic shapes”; it also enables the formation of distinct vector locsiton patterns consisting of multiple vortices in the field distribution. We also studied nonlinear modes of locsitons and found optical bistability and hysteresis in the simplest and most fundamental case of two atoms. We briefly discuss potential applications of those effects.

Being deep in the Lamb-Dicke regime, the scattered light is not broadened by the motion of individual atoms.
