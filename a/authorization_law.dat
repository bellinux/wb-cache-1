The permanent injunction issued by Judge Forrest barred the government from relying on the defense <b>authorization</b> <b>law</b> to hold people in indefinite military detention on suspicion that they [...] "substantially supported" [...] Al Qaeda or its allies — at least if they had no connection to the September 11 attacks. Forrest held that the law's definitions of [...] "substantially supported" [...] and [...] "associated forces" [...] were unconstitutionally vague in that a reporter or activist {{could not be sure}} they would not be covered under the provision if they worked with a group deemed to be associated with terrorists, or perhaps circulated the message of an associated individual by printing an interview. Forrest acknowledged the importance of the government's efforts to safeguard the country from terrorism, but ruled that the law's broad language violated First Amendment right to free speech, as well as the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment right to due process that holds that a person must be able to understand what actions would subject them to penalties.|$|E
40|$|Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), {{also called}} IP {{telephony}} is rapidly becoming a familiar term {{and as a}} technology it is invading the enterprise, private usage, and educational and government organizations. Exploiting advanced voice coding & compression techniques and bandwidth sharing over packet switched networks, VoIP can dramatically improve bandwidth efficiency. Moreover enhanced security features, mobility support, and cost reduction features of VoIP are making it a popular choice for personal communication. Due to its rapid growth in popularity VoIP is rapidly becoming the next generation phone system. Lawful interception is a mean of monitoring private communication of users that are suspected of criminal activities or {{to be a threat}} to national security. However, government regulatory bodies and law enforcement agencies are becoming conscious of the difficulty of lawful interception of public communication due to the mobilitysupport and advanced security features implemented in some implementations of VoIP technology. There has been continuous pressure from the government upon the operators and vendors to find a solution that would make lawful interception feasible and successful. Key escrow was proposed as a solution by the U. S. National Security Agency. In key escrow the key(s) for a session are entrusted to a trusted third party and upon proper <b>authorization</b> <b>law</b> enforcement agencies can receive the session key(s) from this trusted third party However, key escrow adds some security vulnerabilities and potential risks as an unethical employee of the key escrow agent (or a law enforcement agency that has received the session key(s)) can misuse the key(s) to forge content of a communication session [...] as he or she possesses the same key(s) as the user used for this session. This thesis addresses the issue of forged session content, by proposing, implementing, and evaluating a cryptographic model which allows key escrow session content. The implementation utilizes an existing implementation of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) user agent ‘minisip’ developed at KTH. The performance evaluation results suggest that the proposed model can support key escrow while protecting the user communication from being forged with the cost of minimal computational resource and negligible overhead. without the possibility of undetectable fabrication of  session content.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{responsibility}} {{will always be}} actual in all human activities. In the construction industry and real estate engineering, the impact of human activities always have a tangible link, {{it seems to be}} the assessment of duties and responsibility of each participant seemingly simple. The opposite is true, however, as construction and real estate business has passed in the last few decades significant development so that some activities in these fields have become for the general public is almost unreadable. And not only the lay the general public, but also experts and professionals in the field are often lost in the complicated process of construction, of the various stages and its connections with individual activities which have result in the effective complex. Construction Law, building regulations and <b>authorization</b> <b>law</b> can not be regarded as something of directive and bureaucracy of the state and its institutions, but it needs to see them particularly in terms of protection when it was, is and will be primarily in the interests of professionals to clearly defined rules and limits of their activities. It is therefore in the interest of authorized persons to best oriented in the regulations so that they help to improve the performance of their profession. For each authorized person working in the construction industry is important to know the extent of its competences, duties and responsibilities. Without knowledge of these principles can not be selected activities done and can not fulfill their purpose and definition - which is certainly a quality building work which meets all requirements with respect to all subjects of its surroundings. The knowledge gained from this work should serve to simplify the view of the complicated system building regulations for obtaining a healthy perspective and eliminating concerns of this difficult structure. Diploma work does not attempt to change regulations, but rather to understand their meaning and purpose, and point out their necessity. It can be said that knowledge of the legal context is a necessary condition for the performance of selected activities in construction. In any architect, designer and site management must have been a piece of "lawyer", when these people will be able to clearly understand the regulations not only in their profession, but also in connection with the other professions. Based on the findings contained in this thesis it is possible to establish for example open discussion, whether or not to introduce more fields in the building educational system, such as the real estate engineering at USI in Brno, whether and how to create the most appropriate implementation of the construction legal system in the curricula of technical faculties, how to create conditions for systematic knowledge of construction law of authorized persons throughout their careers...|$|E
