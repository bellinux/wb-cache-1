5|$|The {{goal in the}} infinite-dimensional case of the {{representation}} theory is to classify all different possible representations, and to exhibit {{them in terms of}} vector spaces of functions and the action of the standard representation on the <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> functions.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{protesters were}} their concern about making wildlife species, {{such as the}} Chalkhill Blue butterfly, extinct, putting a highly visible scar on the landscape, and that they believed the new motorway would not adequately resolve traffic problems.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} inquiry {{was undertaken}} {{to determine the}} future use of the pipelines, and took evidence from the various stakeholders, most of whom presented the case that favored their companies or industry. The inquiry concluded that the pipelines should be sold for continued use in transporting petroleum. An auction for the pipelines was announced in 1946, {{which was designed to}} give preference to bidders who intended to use them for moving petroleum. 16 bids were received, with the highest cash bidders being companies hoping to use the pipelines for natural gas. Assessing the different bids proved difficult and the discussions became enmeshed in national politics, with companies seeking support from various Washington politicians. Meanwhile, a threatened national coal strike raised concerns over the availability of natural gas, strengthening the <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural gas lobby.|$|E

5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E
25|$|This {{transformation}} group characterisation of equivalence relations differs fundamentally {{from the}} way lattices characterize order relations. The <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lattice theory operations meet and join are elements of some universe A. Meanwhile, the <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transformation group operations composition and inverse are elements {{of a set of}} bijections, A → A.|$|E
25|$|The verbs are, however, zero-marked, with no {{grammatical}} {{agreement with the}} <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> verb.|$|E
2500|$|The binding {{hypothesis}} reconciles {{the fact}} that the possessor appears both as a syntactic and semantic <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> verb but as a semantic <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possessed noun, by assuming inalienable possession constructions are subject to the following syntactic constraints: ...|$|R

25|$|The {{transformation}} of Reni George gave {{credence to the}} <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anti-capital punishment lobby in India and K. T. Thomas, renowned justice of the Supreme Court of India, cited the case in his advocacy against capital punishment.|$|E

30|$|In this respect, {{it should}} be pointed out that, if 60 is the shared {{structure}} for 56 – 59, it can be seen that NP 2 in 60 may or may not be a semantic <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matrix verb. As discussed above, xie in 57 is obviously not an <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> pao ‘to run’, though ta in 59 can be interpreted as an <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> zou ‘to walk’. Moreover, even in those cases where NP 2 in 60 can be interpreted as an <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matrix verb, it is not necessarily a Patient. This can be seen from the contrast between 58 and 59. Although wo in 58 and ta in 59 both correspond to the NP 2 in 60 and can both be understood as a semantic <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corresponding main predicate, ta in 59 semantically is an Agent <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> zou ‘to walk’ and wo in 58 can be interpreted as <b>the</b> Patient <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> qi ‘to annoy’. Therefore, NP 2 in 60 is not necessarily a Patient <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matrix verb.|$|R

40|$|When a noun is {{modified}} by an adnominal, as in blue door, short giraffe, or {{book on the}} table, the modifier is often analyzed as applying to an <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> predicate that the noun denotes. We call this <b>argument</b> <b>the</b> referential <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> noun (Williams 1981,Higginbotham 1985). Consider for instance (1) ...|$|R
25|$|Major {{theological}} sources {{include the}} writings of John of Damascus, Theodore the Studite, and the Patriarch Nikephoros, all of them iconodules. The theological <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iconoclasts survive only {{in the form of}} selective quotations embedded in iconodule documents, most notably the Acts of the Second Council of Nicaea and the Antirrhetics of Nikephoros.|$|E
25|$|Eloise Jelinek, {{having worked}} with Salishan and Athabascan languages, {{proposed}} {{an analysis of}} polysynthetic languages in which the morphemes that agree with the <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> verb are not just considered indexes of the arguments, but in fact constitute the primary expression of the arguments within the sentence. Because this theory posits that the pronominal agreement morphemes are the true syntactic <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sentence, Jelinek's hypothesis was called the pronominal argument hypothesis. If the hypothesis were correct, it would mean that free standing nouns in such languages did not constitute syntactical arguments, but simply adjoined specifiers or adjuncts. This in turn explained why many polysynthetic languages seem to be non-configurational, i.e. they have no strict rules for word order and seemingly violate many of the basic rules for syntactic structures posited within the generative framework.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} the priests recited the Ten Commandments daily. The Gemara, however, taught that {{although}} the Sages wanted to recite the Ten Commandments along with the Shema in precincts outside of the Temple, they soon abolished their recitation, because the Sages {{did not want to}} lend credence to the <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heretics (who might argue that Jews honored only the Ten Commandments).|$|E
5000|$|However, {{these type}} of possessors are problematic. There is a {{discrepancy}} between where the possessor appears syntactically in an inalienable possession construction and what its semantic relationship to the inalienable noun seems to be. Semantically, <b>the</b> possessor <b>of</b> an inalienable noun is intrinsic to its meaning and acts like a semantic argument. In the surface syntactic structure, however, the possessor appears in a position that marks it as an <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> verb. [...] Thus, there are different views on how these types of inalienable possession constructions should be represented in the syntactic structure. The binding hypothesis argues that the possessor is an <b>argument</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> verb.

25|$|Although the Maritime {{leaders were}} swayed by the <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadians, many {{ordinary}} {{residents of the}} Maritimes {{wanted no part of}} this larger confederation for fear that their interests and concerns would be ignored in a wider national union. Many politicians who supported confederation, such as Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley (New Brunswick's best-known Father of Confederation), found themselves without a seat after the next election; nevertheless, backers of the wider confederation eventually prevailed.|$|E
25|$|Pius XI's successor, Pope Pius XII, who was {{not aware}} of the text before the death of his predecessor, chose not to publish it. His first {{encyclical}} Summi Pontificatus ("On the Supreme Pontificate", 12 October 1939), published after the beginning of World War II, bore the title On the Unity of Human Society and used many of the <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> document drafted for Pius XI, while avoiding its negative characterizations of the Jewish people.|$|E
25|$|The court {{does not}} hear {{evidence}} or question witnesses. It does not decide directly whether accused persons are guilty or whether damages should be awarded to an injured person. These are matters for the ordinary courts. Its {{function is to}} determine the meaning of the Constitution in relation to matters in dispute. One consequence of this is that the court works largely with written arguments presented to it by the parties.

25|$|In his {{responsibilities}} as Intergovernmental Affairs {{minister in the}} Jean Chrétien government, Dion was tasked with challenging the <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quebec sovereignty movement much more vigorously than in the pre-referendum period. The people of Quebec voted against the sovereignty option by a razor-thin margin (50.58% to 49.42%). Many federalists in Ottawa were caught off-guard by the results and believed that the referendum results would have no legal standing under Canadian law. The strongest complaints were on the presumed ambiguity of the 1995 question and that Quebec had tabled a law reserving the right for the National Assembly to declare independence unilaterally if constitutional negotiations with the Government of Canada failed.|$|E
500|$|In October 2009, Specter {{called for}} {{the repeal of the}} Defense of Marriage Act, which he had {{supported}} in 1996. In November 2009, Specter introduced a bill to require televising U.S. Supreme Court proceedings, and explained that [...] "he Supreme Court makes pronouncements on constitutional and federal law that have direct impacts on the rights of Americans. Those rights would be substantially enhanced by televising the oral <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court so that the public can see and hear the issues presented." ...|$|E
500|$|The <b>arguments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bill's opponents {{attracted}} {{little support}} in the Senate.

We deplore the present antiquated methods of handling our mentally ill." [...] It also urged the National Council of Churches to mobilize support for the bill. An overwhelming majority of senators of both parties were also supportive. The bill's original author, Alaska Delegate Bob Bartlett, spoke for many of the bill's proponents when he expressed his bafflement at the response that it had received: ...|$|E
