40|$|This {{report has}} been {{elaborated}} {{as part of}} the CHANGE research project ([URL] funded by the BONUS programme and national research funding institutions, in this case the Academy of Finland. The overall objective of the interdisciplinary CHANGE project is to reduce to a minimum the supply of toxic compounds from antifouling paints used on leisure boats in the Baltic Sea by changing antifouling practices on leisure boats into a sustainable consumption of antifouling paints and practices. As part of the CHANGE project, a mapping of EU legislation as well as national legislation in Sweden, Finland and Denmark has been carried out. This report maps the Finnish legal framework regarding antifouling paints on leisure boats {{as well as for the}} use of alternative techniques. The report starts with an introduction to the overall governance structure of the legislation and the relevant authorities. It then is divided into four areas of law relevant to antifouling paints and practices, including regulation of environmental quality, products, waste management and other environmental issues as well as contaminated land and sediments. Furthermore, the report includes a table containing an analysis from the actors’ perspective. The report is based on a legal-dogmatic research on <b>applicable</b> <b>national</b> <b>legislation</b> based on relevant sources of law as well as relevant reports, articles etc. Finnish legislation is accessible in both Finnish and Swedish languages at the national database [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Air {{transport}} is by {{its very}} nature one of the most international of economic activities. However, until fairly recently, its regulatory framework has been premised on an overriding nationalism developed and maintained {{on the basis of the}} following: substantial ownership and effective control provisions found in <b>national</b> <b>legislation</b> and most bilateral air transport agreements; restrictions on cabotage found in <b>national</b> <b>legislation,</b> most bilateral air transport agreements and Article 7 of the Chicago Convention; and the related national restrictions on the right of establishment <b>applicable</b> to <b>national</b> carriers. However, as the international component of the air transport industry has grown in importance, the tenets underlying this restrictive regulatory system are increasingly coming into question. This thesis examines the development of international airline co-operation and integration, namely by way of mergers, franchises and alliances, in the face of the existing regulatory obstacles. It examines the legal impediments to, the form of, and the costs and benefits of each of these integrative methods and their various derivatives. Finally, it traces the regulatory responses to these integrative activities, and explores the possibility and methodology of creating a truly global airline, both in form and in function...|$|R
