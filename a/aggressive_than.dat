5|$|More recent investigations, mainly {{based on}} {{original}} medical {{reports from the}} period of the pandemic, found that the viral infection itself was not more <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> any previous influenza, but that the special circumstances (malnourishment, overcrowded medical camps and hospitals, poor hygiene) promoted bacterial superinfection that killed most of the victims typically after a somewhat prolonged death bed.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are easily}} {{distinguished}} from males {{as they have}} a narrower and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller cere and nostrils, more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour is not {{very different from that}} of the male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. They tend to resist more and be more <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> the male when handled. Nesting females also have a brood patch on the bare skin of the belly.|$|E
5|$|A complex courting ritual {{performed}} underwater characterises the crested and marbled newts. Males are territorial and use leks, or courtship arenas, small {{patches of}} clear ground where they display and attract females. When they encounter other males, {{they use the}} same postures as described below for courting to impress their counterpart. Occasionally, they even bite each other; marbled newts seem more <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> crested newts. Males also frequently disturb the courting of other males and try to guide the female away from their rival. Pheromones are used to attract females, and once a male has found one he will pursue her and position {{himself in front of}} her. After this first orientation phase, courtship proceeds with display and spermatophore transfer.|$|E

5|$|Aided by his serve, Raonic employs an all-court {{style with}} an {{emphasis}} on short points. His groundstrokes are both good, but his forehand is stronger than his backhand. Because of this, he has been known to run around his backhand and hit inside-out forehands instead. He attempts to dictate play and is generally more <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> his opponent, as evidenced by usually having more winners and more unforced errors. To finish points quickly, Raonic occasionally approaches the net, with either a serve and volley or chip and charge strategy.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are recorded}} as making 242 unprovoked attacks between 1948 and mid-2004, causing sixteen human fatalities. Ten {{of these were}} {{in the water and}} two were on land; the circumstances of the other four are not known. Most attacks were in the warmer months of the year, though in Florida, with its warmer climate, attacks can happen at any time of year. Alligators are considered to be less <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> either the Nile or saltwater crocodile, but the increase in density of the human population in the Everglades has brought people and alligators into closer proximity and increased the risk of alligator attacks. Conversely in Mauritania, where the crocodiles' growth is severely stunted by the arid conditions, the local people swim with them without being attacked.|$|E
5|$|Back in 1959 a Laotian Lieutenant Colonel of the {{minority}} Hmong tribe had been taken under the wing of the CIA effort in Laos. The highland Hmong were more <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> the lowland Lao and Vang Pao was quickly elevated to their leadership in hopes of creating a paramilitary force that would counter the Pathet Lao in the northeast. During 1961, the first weapons were delivered to the Hmong and their training was begun. Nine CIA specialists, nine U.S. Army Special Forces personnel, and 99 Thai members of the Police Aerial Reconnaissance Unit (PARU) participated in the training and equipping of {{what became known as}} the Armée Clandestine or the secret army.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} {{higher levels of}} {{androgen}} exposure, the female hyenas are significantly more muscular and <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> their male counterparts; social-wise, they are of higher rank than the males, being dominant or dominant and alpha, and the females who {{have been exposed to}} higher levels of androgen than average become higher-ranking than their female peers. Subordinate females lick the clitorises of higher-ranked females as a sign of submission and obedience, but females also lick each other's clitorises as a greeting or to strengthen social bonds; in contrast, while all males lick the clitorises of dominant females, the females will not lick the penises of males because males are considered to be of lowest rank.|$|E
5|$|Mallard {{have had}} a long {{relationship}} with humans. Almost all domestic duck breeds derive from the mallard, {{with the exception of}} a few Muscovy breeds. Mallards are generally monogamous while domestic ducks are mostly polygamous. Domestic ducks have no territorial behaviour and are less <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> mallards. Domestic ducks are mostly kept for meat, as their eggs have a strong flavor. They were first domesticated in Southeast Asia at least 4000 years ago, during the Neolithic Age, and were also farmed by the Romans in Europe, and the Malays in Asia. It is also common for mallards to mate with domestic ducks and produce hybrid offspring that are fully fertile. Due to this, mallards have been found to be contaminated with the genes of the domestic duck.|$|E
5|$|Reported {{to be more}} <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> other stingarees, the sparsely-spotted stingaree readily employs its venomous sting if {{disturbed}} and can inflict {{a painful}} injury on a human. It is edible, but seldom brought to market. Fishing pressure is insignificant across large portions of this ray's range, including in the Great Australian Bight, though substantial numbers are caught incidentally by commercial fisheries off southeastern and southwestern Australia in beach seines and bottom trawls. The sparsely-spotted stingaree generally survives being captured, sorted, and discarded, though the process often causes it to abort any unborn young. Nevertheless, losses to fisheries appear to be sustainable at present, and thus the IUCN has listed this species under Least Concern. There {{are a number of}} small Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) within its range, and it would potentially benefit from the implementation of the 2004 Australian National Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks.|$|E
40|$|The high {{prevalence}} of dating {{violence and the}} severity of its aftermath warrant the collaboration between research and practice {{for the development of}} pre-vention and intervention programs. This study investigates young adolescents’ perceptions of dating partner’s behaviors in common dating situations and their behavioral reaction to these dating situations. Initially, focus groups pro-vided responses used {{for the development of a}} dating violence questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of dating scenarios related to perceptions and expected behaviors of the characters in the scenarios. Second, another sample of adolescents responded to the scenarios. Descriptive statistics found that boys and girls reported fewer <b>aggressive</b> perceptions <b>than</b> <b>aggressive</b> behav-ioral responses to the dating scenarios. Nonparametric statistics revealed that adolescent boys were significantly more likely to expect <b>aggressive</b> responses <b>than</b> girls. These findings have implications for practitioners charged with preventing dating violence...|$|R

5|$|The {{disagreements}} between Edward and the French Crown {{over the}} Duchy of Gascony {{led to the}} War of Saint-Sardos in 1324. Charles, Edward's brother-in-law, had become King of France in 1322, and was more <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> his predecessors. In 1323, he insisted that Edward come to Paris to give homage for Gascony, and demanded that Edward's administrators in Gascony allow French officials there to carry out orders given in Paris. Matters {{came to a head}} in October when a group of Edward's soldiers hanged a French sergeant for attempting to build a new fortified town in the Agenais, a contested section of the Gascon border. Edward denied any responsibility for this incident, but relations between Edward and Charles soured. In 1324, Edward dispatched the Earl of Pembroke to Paris to broker a solution, but the earl died suddenly of an illness along the way. Charles mobilised his army and ordered the invasion of Gascony.|$|E

25|$|After {{recovering}} from her broken arm, Krasner {{began working on}} bright and decorative allover painting which are less <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> her Earth Green Series and Umber Series paintings. Often, these images recall calligraphy or floral ornamentation which are not blatantly related to Krasner's emotional state. Floral or calligraphic shapes dominate the canvas, connecting variable brushwork into a single pattern.|$|E
25|$|Mammography is {{not very}} useful in finding breast tumors in dense breast tissue {{characteristic}} of women under 40 years. In women over 50 without dense breasts, breast cancers detected by screening mammography are usually smaller and less <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> those detected by patients or doctors as a breast lump. This is because the most aggressive breast cancers are found in dense breast tissue, which mammograms perform poorly on.|$|E

25|$|Most {{people with}} {{epithelial}} ovarian carcinoma, about two-thirds, have a serous carcinoma, though this proportion is estimated {{as high as}} 80%. Low-grade serous carcinoma is less <b>aggressive</b> <b>than</b> high-grade serous carcinomas, though it does not typically respond well to chemotherapy or hormonal treatments. Serous carcinomas are thought to begin in the Fallopian tube. Histologically, serous adenocarcinomas have psammoma bodies. Low-grade serous adenocarcinomas resemble Fallopian tube epithelium, whereas high-grade serous adenocarcinomas show anaplasia and nuclear atypia.|$|E
