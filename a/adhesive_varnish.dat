At the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit (ORAU), common examples of such substances encountered include shellac, the acrylic polymers Paraloid B- 67 and B- 72, and vinyl acetate-derived polymers (e. g.

Here, a non-carbon-containing absorbent substrate called Chromosorb® was deliberately contaminated {{with a range of}} varieties or brands of these conservation treatments, as well as two cellulose nitrate lacquers. A selection of chemical pretreatments was tested for their efficiency at removing them.

Proteins (mainly egg yolk and/or egg white, casein, animal glue and collagen) have been extensively used as paint binders, <b>adhesives</b> and <b>varnishes</b> in mural and easel paintings, {{and they can be}} found in archaeological findings, such as bones and skin tissues. In order to overcome limitations of wet chemical methods arising from the reduced solubility of aged proteins in samples of cultural heritage, a combination of analytical pyrolysis techniques was used to characterise reference materials, paint reconstructions and samples from different historical periods (2 nd century BC- 20 th century AD) and geographical origins, which were collected from paintings and archaeological findings. In particular evolved gas analysis mass spectrometry (EGA/MS), pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py/GC/MS) and double shot pyrolysis/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (DSP/GC/MS) were used. This analytical approach allowed us to characterise and differentiate the proteinaceous media, investigate their thermal behaviour and evidence changes occurring with ageing. Data clearly indicate that egg, casein and animal glue can be identified and distinguished in a sample of unknown composition using each of the analytical pyrolysis techniques used. With time though differences tend to disappear to the extent that extremely degraded samples present pyrolytic profiles extremely similar to each other, irrespective {{of the nature of the}} proteins present.

It {{is one of the most}} appropriate techniques to identify organic compounds presents in most several materials (e. g. binding media, <b>varnishes,</b> <b>adhesives,</b> etc.). It does, however, present some disadvantages (i.e. water absorption) related to the experimental procedures. Classically, a considerable amount of sample was required to disperse in an “IR transparent” material, such as KBr or NaCl, to form a pellet from where the information was obtained. This resulted, in most cases, in the sacrifice of the sample in order to obtain good quality results. Fortunately, instrumental advances have allowed obtaining the same information with fewer amounts of sample and practically without preparation. One of these advances is the use of attenuated total reflection (ATR-FTIR) sampling method, in which a small fragment of the sample is pressed against a crystal used as a medium to make the IR radiation to interact with the material. Despite this, in most of the cases the original form of the sample is modified somehow. FTIR besides being micro-destructive to the object is also destructive to the sample.|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} review the available literature data concerning phosphorous FRs primarily for neurotoxic, fertility, reproductive and carcinogenic effects. The analysis concerned the following most commonly used substances: tris(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP), tris(2 -butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP), triphenyl phosphate (TPP), tris(2 -chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tetrakis(hydroxymethyl) -phosphonium chloride (THPC), tributyl phosphate (TBP), tricresyl phosphate (TCP), tris(2 -chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCPP), tris(1, 3 -dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCP) and tetrakis(hydroxymethyl) phosphonium sulphate (THPS). In animal studies neurotoxic effects were found after exposure to TBEP, THPC, TBP and TCP, while in humans they were observed only after exposure to TCP. TCEP, THPS, TBP, TCP and TDCP caused disorders in fertility and/or fetal development of animals. Adverse effects on reproduction in humans may be caused by TPP, TCP, and TDCP. In laboratory animals the development of tumors was observed after high doses of TEHP, TCEP, TBP and TDCP. None of these compounds is classified as a human carcinogen.

The first step in the analysis of a solution is derivatization of isocyanates for the separation through HPLC, for their qualitative as well as quantitative analysis. Air sampling and analysis was performed according to (NIOSH) method 5522 for diisocyanate in air. The results revealed that a correlation between MDI concentration and relative humidity, dry bulb temperature, altitude and dimension of polyurethane factories. Dimension of factories yields reasonable negative relationship, the MDI concentration was ranged from 93. 8 to 99 (μg/m 3) and statistically significant at 0. 0001 level and the relative humidity was ranged from 42. 6 to 45 % and dry bulb temperatureranged from 28 to 29 °C were statistically significant at 0. 035 and 0. 0001 level, respectively. A statistical predictive model was obtained from multiple regression modeling for MDI and psychrometric parameters.

40|$|Vegetable-derived oils are of {{interest}} for industrial applications {{partly because of the}} chemical similarity of plant oils to mineral oils but also because of the economic need to reduce overproduction of seed oils for nutritional use. Complex oils can be produced in seeds as a low cost agricultural product based on renewable solar energy that requires less refining and is biodegradable and thus produces less adverse effects on the environment. In addition, biotechnologies have accelerated selection programmes and increased the genetic diversity available for the development of new varieties of oilseeds with specific fatty acid compositions. In the developing oilseed, energy and carbon are stored as lipid under the form of triacylglycerol, that is, a glycerol molecule to which three fatty acids are esterified. Fatty acids comprise a linear chain of carbon atoms, the first of which carries an organic acid group. The chain length and the presence of double bonds determine the properties of the fatty acid which in turn determine the physical and chemical properties of the oil of storage lipids and hence their economic value. In addition to the common C 16 - and C 18 -saturated and unsaturated fatty acids of membrane lipids, the seed storage lipids of many plant species contain unusual fatty acids (UFAs) which can vary in chain length, in the degree of unsaturation, possess double bonds in unusual positions, or can contain additional functional groups such as hydroxy, epoxy, cyclic and acetylenic groups [1].

40|$|OBJETIVO: avaliar a atividade antimicrobiana da associação de um adesivo ortodôntico com um verniz de clorexidina e timol. MÉTODOS: foram utilizados 32 pré-molares humanos divididos em 4 grupos. O grupo 1 consistiu do grupo controle, no qual o adesivo utilizado para a colagem do braquete não estava associado a nenhum agente antimicrobiano. Os grupos 2, 3 e 4 foram colados com um sistema adesivo associado a um verniz de clorexidina e timol. Os grupos 3 e 4 foram armazenados em água por 7 dias e 30 dias, respectivamente, enquanto os corpos de prova do grupo 2 foram, logo depois da colagem, colocados em ágar semeado com Streptococcus mutans por 48 h a 37 ºC. RESULTADOS: os grupos experimentais, com exceção do grupo controle, apresentaram atividade antimicrobiana com tendência de redução do seu potencial de ação com maior tempo de imersão em água. CONCLUSÃO: a associação do verniz de clorexidina a um sistema adesivo utilizado em Ortodontia apresenta-se vantajosa pela sua atividade antimicrobiana. OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{antimicrobial}} activity {{resulting from the}} association of an orthodontic <b>adhesive</b> with chlorhexidine-thymol <b>varnish.</b> METHODS: Thirty-two extracted human premolars were used, divided into four groups. In Group 1, the control group, the adhesive used to bond the bracket {{was not associated with}} any antimicrobial agent. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were bonded with an adhesive system associated with chlorhexidine-thymol varnish. Groups 3 and 4 were stored in water for 7 days and 30 days, respectively, while the specimens from group 2 were, soon after bonding, placed on agar seeded with Streptococcus mutans for 48 hours, at 37 º C. RESULTS: The experimental groups, {{with the exception of the}} control group, showed antimicrobial activity whose action tended to decline commensurately with the amount of time that they remained immersed in water. CONCLUSIONS: The association of chlorhexidine-thymol <b>varnish</b> with an <b>adhesive</b> system used in orthodontics proved to be advantageous due to its antimicrobial activity...|$|R
