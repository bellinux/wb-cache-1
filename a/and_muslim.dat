40|$|The {{problematic}} {{nature of}} news media framing of Islam <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> by Western news media {{has been well}} established by researchers. While {{research has focused on}} the ways such representations occur {{and to a lesser extent}} their effects on individuals and communities, we know little about why journalists frame Islam <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> in the Western news media in the ways they do. While studies point to a lack of knowledge about Islam <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> in non-Muslim populations, we know very little about how this translates to news media practitioners. This study draws from a far broader research project focused on encouraging more informed reporting of Islam <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> by the Australian news media. In this study, we establish the baseline knowledge of a purposive sample of Australian news media practitioners and journalism students about Islam and reporting stories about Islam <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> before <b>and</b> after targeted training. We find a relatively small investment in time significantly shifts this knowledge in both areas. Targeted training that includes a focus on basic facts about Islam as well as raising awareness of the resources that are now available to journalists may go some way towards improving reportage of Islam <b>and</b> <b>Muslims.</b> Arts, Education & Law Group, School of Humanities, Languages and Social SciencesNo Full Tex...|$|R

The presence of Jewish <b>and</b> <b>Muslim</b> merchants in the kingdom was due to its role as a crossroad of trading routes leading towards Constantinople, Regensburg and Kiev.
