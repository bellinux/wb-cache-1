Later that year, Staples and Rysdam left Job for <b>a</b> <b>Cowboy</b> and were replaced by Brent Riggs and Elliott Sellers, respectively, as bassist and drummer. Traffic to the band's MySpace profile increased exponentially in late 2005 when the band released their first EP, Doom. The EP {{attracted the attention of}} Arizona independent label King of the Monsters, who distributed the disc after an initial self-released pressing by the band.|$|E
5|$|Wherever Bissell went, he {{attracted}} attention, {{both from}} his fiery dancing and his habit of wearing <b>a</b> <b>cowboy</b> hat and boots around New York City—his way of distinguishing {{he was a}} true-blue native Texan. He also made {{his way around the}} city on a motorcycle.|$|E

5|$|Holmes {{had served}} under Kit Carson and John C. Fremont, {{but he was}} old and {{physically}} impaired when he met Burnham. He had lost all of his family in the Indian wars and before he died he wanted to impart {{his knowledge of the}} frontier to the young Burnham. The two men traveled throughout the American Southwest and northern Mexico, and Holmes taught him many scouting skills, such as how to track a trail, how to double and cover one's own trail, how to properly ascend and descend precipices, and how to tell the time at night. Burnham also learned survival skills from Holmes, such as where to find water in the desert, how to protect himself from snakes, and what to do in case of forest fires or floods. A stickler for details, Holmes impressed on him that even in the simplest things, such as braiding a rope, tying a knot, or putting on or taking off a saddle, there is a right way and a wrong way. The two men earned a living by hunting and prospecting. Burnham also worked as <b>a</b> <b>cowboy,</b> a guard for the mines, a guide, and a scout during these years.|$|E

5|$|On December 1, 1884, a town sheriff named Elfego Baca came {{face-to-face}} against 80 gunmen {{which became}} known as the Frisco shootout. The battle started when Baca arrested <b>a</b> <b>cowboy</b> who had shot him. In turn the cowboy called upon 80 of his associates to murder Baca. Baca took refuge in an adobe house, and {{over the course of a}} 36-hour siege, the gunmen put 400 bullet holes in the house (some accounts say a total of 4,000 shots) without touching Baca. He in turn killed 4 of them and wounded 8. When the shooting was over as the attackers finally ran out of ammo, Baca strolled out of the house unscathed.
