JP as {{to four years}} of Alfred Richardson as Chief Constable of Halifax." [...] 1907 had seen the Women's Suffrage Movement make its presence known in Halifax, mainly by a local resident named Lavina Saltonstall (1881–1957). Saltonstall was born near Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire, and moved to live permanently in Haugh Road Halifax in 1906. Saltonstall met the suffragette Christabel Pankhurst who had toured the area, especially around 1905/6. She made speeches in Halifax during the tram strike and agitating for reform for women by writing letters. This then evolved into a local suffragette movement in Halifax, which Alfred Richardson had to monitor with care and tact. In 1908 Saltonstall wrote {{an article in the}} local newspaper, The Halifax Guardian, entitled [...] "Our Police System" [...] a by-product of which was to give an insight into the Halifax Police and Chief Constable Richardson. Part of the article stated: [...] "In order to gather a little information, concerning the work of the Police Force, the other day I paid a visit to the Halifax Borough court. First of all I will mention the fact that a friend of mine had business with the Chief Constable, which fact gave us the chance of getting to his office. Presently we came to an inquiry office where we had to await the Chief's pleasure. Photographs of police groups adorned. Presently we received the intimation that the Chief was disengaged, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> into another room sumptuously furnished. The Chief himself had taken refuge behind a table on which were books and pens and inks and flowers. Several movable objects in the form of chairs and rulers and books, and also a fire-screen, were placed near him. An ecclesiastical looking individual in belt and buttons, and with a signet ring and a scholarly stoop, he mounted guard over the door by which we had entered. As in the outer office, photographs etc. and the Chief's overcoat, tall hat, and walking-stick adorned the walls." [...] Comments were made in the local press about how well the local constabulary handled the Suffragette Movement in the town from this time (1908) until its demise in 1916. It seems that the Chief Constable met {{with a certain amount of}} approval by Saltonstall.|$|E
60|$|We {{left him}} working among his chemicals, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> {{together}} towards my hotel.|$|E
60|$|Yes, please, said Sylvie, {{putting her}} hand into mine: <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> off together.|$|E
60|$|Some one is with me, but I cannot see him, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> {{through the}} forest, pushing our way among the tangled vines that cling about our feet, and {{every now and}} then, between the giant tree-trunks, we catch glimpses of the noisy street.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> {{away from}} the hotel I related the {{particulars}} about the note-book.|$|R
6000|$|Thumb {{raised his}} hand as if in peace. [...] "We are, sirs, strangers to these rocks and hills. After the shade of Munza, our eyes dizzy with the heights. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk,</b> journeying to the Courts of Assasimmon, in great danger of falling. How, then, shall we pass by?" ...|$|R
60|$|My {{father gave}} me his arm, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> slowly {{up and down the}} lawn.|$|E
60|$|This I {{did very}} reverently <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> {{back to the}} temple almost in silence.|$|E
60|$|He took me {{out again}} into his garden after supper, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> beneath the trees.|$|E
60|$|Pleased {{with the}} simple and {{friendly}} Scala di Ferre, I shoulder my sack <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> off to the second station. The sun is shining hot this afternoon--burning hot, by the sea. The road and the buildings look dry and desiccated, the harbour rather weary {{and end of the}} world.|$|R
60|$|He was wearied {{with the}} {{fatigues}} of the day, <b>and,</b> as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> out, {{fell into a}} fit of gloomy musing.|$|R
60|$|Dick got his hat <b>and</b> came. <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> up {{the road}} in lovely creamy yellow {{twilight}} and I was, oh, so happy.|$|R
60|$|Holmes was curiously distrait, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> up {{and down}} the garden path for some time in silence.|$|E
60|$|The {{young lady}} walked between us, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> {{on the cool}} sea sand, in the {{direction}} of Filey.|$|E
60|$|And {{the friend}} that I had loved came towards me, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> {{together}} with our hands clasped. But I hated him.|$|E
6000|$|And {{after that}} serene and {{somewhat}} dull [...] Epoch, that awkward corner turned for days [...] More quiet, when our moon's no more at full, [...] We may presume to criticise or praise; [...] Because Indifference begins to lull [...] Our passions, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> in Wisdom's ways; [...] Also because the figure {{and the face}} [...] Hint, that 't is time to give the younger place.|$|R
6000|$|... "We go on. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> {{in dreams}} through the silence. <b>And</b> every time <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> {{is a dream}} <b>and</b> <b>we</b> are without pain; <b>and</b> every time <b>we</b> fall down is an awakening, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> see the snow and the {{mountains}} and the fresh trail of the man who is before us, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> know all our pain again. We come to where we can see a long way over the snow, and that for which they look is before them. A mile away there are black spots upon the snow. The black spots move. My eyes are dim, and I must stiffen my soul to see. And I see one man with dogs and a sled. The baby wolves see, too. They can no longer talk, but they whisper, 'On, on. Let us hurry!' ...|$|R
60|$|Herbert got up, {{and linked}} {{his arm in}} mine, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> slowly <b>walked</b> to <b>and</b> fro together, {{studying}} the carpet.|$|R
60|$|I {{carried a}} scythe, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked,</b> pleasantly weary, {{down the hill}} towards the farm. The {{children}} had gone home with the rabbits.|$|E
6000|$|MINNIE. My brother Bert's out there--he ain't working today. Mr. Pindar {{sent for}} father, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> {{up here with}} him. Where is he? ...|$|E
60|$|He {{took the}} {{path through the}} plantation, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> down to the village through the woods which bordered {{one side of the}} estate.|$|E
50|$|<b>And</b> here <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> in {{the battle}} of life -Solid, durable, unbreakable, like granite,For crying hasn't given freedom to anyone yet,But whoever is a fighter, he conquers the world.|$|R
40|$|If I {{look with}} new eyes while walking I may see nature differently. When {{mind and heart}} behold no names, create no boundaries, the {{conversation}} becomes intersubjective. A two-way path is formed <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> together along the river’s vulnerable edge. Flowing through our ups and downs connecting our similarities and embracing our differences. Like stripped bark from a downed tree we are exposed to a new understanding...|$|R
6000|$|And {{after that}} serene and {{somewhat}} dull [...] Epoch, that awkward corner turn'd for days [...] More quiet, when our moon 's no more at full, [...] We may presume to criticise or praise; [...] Because indifference begins to lull [...] Our passions, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> in wisdom's ways; [...] Also because the figure {{and the face}} [...] Hint, that 't is time to give the younger place.|$|R
6000|$|... "He held me, I remember, [...] Just as when [...] Our {{life was}} June--(September [...] It was then); <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> on, until he spoke again.|$|E
60|$|So our bonds were undone <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> {{to where}} the king and Brother John stood, the miserable Imbozwi and his {{attendant}} doctors huddled in a heap before them.|$|E
60|$|I acquiesced, {{though not}} feeling at ease; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> on, till {{we came to}} a public house, in the {{vicinity}} of the place at which the cars are taken.|$|E
60|$|That was our style, you know, <b>and</b> {{meanwhile}} <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> together up {{the narrow}} street outside his lodging, up the stepway and the lanes toward Clayton Crest and the high road.|$|R
60|$|The {{cessation}} {{of the second}} and last spell of work comes about midday, <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> home, through this beautiful intricacy of a town to our cheap hotel beside the lake.|$|R
60|$|In this {{arrangement}} <b>we</b> rested, <b>and</b> as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> {{back to camp}} I cared nothing for the sly words or glances of our fellow artists. I believed I had won my case.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, Macumazahn, then {{stay and}} be killed," [...] he answered, taking {{a pinch of}} snuff. [...] "Come, let us see about the waggons," [...] <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> towards the laager.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come to the 'Gray's-inn Coffee-house,'" [...] Pinto said, [...] "and I {{will tell}} you how THE NOTCH CAME TO THE AXE." [...] <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> down Holborn at about thirty-seven minutes past six o'clock.|$|E
60|$|I {{thanked him}} heartily for the offer, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> {{back to the}} hamlet where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose {{they were all in}} the saddle.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{town had}} swelled up some, but {{one or two}} of the old stores was there, <b>and</b> as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> past the windows I says: 'Remember the time <b>we</b> stood here <b>and</b> wished <b>we</b> could buy things?' ...|$|R
50|$|My Mexican friend Tony {{took me to}} {{meet this}} woman named Margot at her house. She gave us some tequila or {{something}} and she goes in the bedroom <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> in <b>and</b> there's this big fat naked guy with an onion in his mouth. He's wearing women's underwear and high heels and he's tied up with duct tape against the wall. Me and Tony were like, What the fuck is going on here? Cracking up laughing. She was this dominatrix chick.|$|R
5000|$|... "It's {{not true}} {{we could never}} go outside. John Sheardown's house had an {{interior}} courtyard with a garden <b>and</b> <b>we</b> could <b>walk</b> there freely," [...] Mark Lijek says.|$|R
