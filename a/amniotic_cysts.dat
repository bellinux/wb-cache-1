40|$|Fifty {{cases of}} placental lesions {{detected}} by sonography {{during the second}} half of pregnancy were pathologicaly investigated. Sonographic evaluation included the size of the lesion, its echogenicity on subsequent examinations and location in relation to the placental margin and umbilical cord insertions. Classical pathologic examination was performed after delivery to confirm the ultrasonographic findings. The echogenic pattern of these lesions was distinct from that of the rest of the placenta and the lesions were classified in two categories: The parenchymal lesions including 19 intervillous thrombosis, 14 cavernas, 3 cases of hydatidiform changes, 2 infarcts, 1 septal cyst and one case of fibrin deposition and, the chorionic lesions including 5 subchorionic thrombosis, 3 cases of extrachorialis placentas and 2 <b>amniotic</b> <b>cysts.</b> Therefore diagnostic ultrasound gives the clinician a unique opportunity to perform detailed examination of the placenta in vivo and can be an effective and noninvasive way to diagnose different types of lesions that are usually described in post-partum by the pathologist.

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of the tumour markers CA 125 and CA 19 - 9 were determined in peritoneal, <b>cyst</b> and <b>amniotic</b> fluids, with particular attention {{being paid to}} certain reliability criteria of the assay methods. The antigens were measured in undiluted samples and after several dilutions. A recovery test was also performed and protein content evaluated. The results show high levels of CA 125 in all fluids; in descending order of concentration: amniotic (2376 - 3891 U ml- 1), peritoneal (379 - 4040 U ml- 1) and cyst fluid (124 - 466 U ml- 1). <b>Amniotic,</b> peritoneal and <b>cyst</b> fluid {{concentrations of}} CA 19 - 9 {{were found to be}} 314 - 1008 U ml- 1, 26. 7 - 2182 U ml- 1 and 226 - 2988 U ml- 1, respectively. Recovery was between 80 and 100 % for all fluids. CA 125 was easily assayable in all fluids, except amniotic and peritoneal which required dilution even of the samples which fell within the range of the standard curve before dilution. The presence of CA 125 and CA 19 - 9 in <b>amniotic</b> and <b>cyst</b> fluids emphasizes the non-specificity of these molecules and suggests caution in the interpretation of the results...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The fetal antigen i {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} by indirect immunofluorescence on cord erythrocytes and placental trophoblast. A patient with disseminated choriocarcinoma developed high-titre anti-i cold agglutinins, and minor elevation of anti-i titres was seen in four out of six further patients with treated choriocarcinoma. In normal pregnant women, 6 % showed similar increases in anti-i titres. The i and I erythrocyte antigens have recently been described as ceramide hepta and deca sac-charides (Hakamori, 1977). The fetal i character of erythrocytes changes after birth, and by 18 months of age the red cells carry mainly I (Marsh, 1961). Detection of i substance {{has been reported in}} saliva, milk, <b>amniotic</b> fluid, ovarian <b>cyst</b> fluid, and serum (Race and Sanger, 1975). In the following report, i antigen is demonstrated in placental trophoblast, and the development of an anti-i cold agglutinin is reported in a case of disseminated choriocarcinoma. Case history A 40 -year-old woman had experienced abnormal postpartum vaginal bleeding for two years. She had passed blood clots and tissue fragments for eight months and had lost 5 kg in weight. She appeared pale, and the uterus was enlarged to the size of an 18 -week pregnancy. The liver and spleen were slightly enlarged. A PrognosticonR pregnancy test was positive on urine diluted 1 / 10, and uterine curettings showed choriocarcinoma. Uterine ultrasound showed no pelvic wall invasion, and liver/spleen scans showed hepatosplenomegaly but without visible filling defects. Biochemical screening showed elevated alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase, however, and a chest x-ray revealed multiple metastases in both lungs. HAEMATOLOGY AND SEROLOGY The Hb was 5 - 5 g/dl, and the blood smear showed a hypochromic microcytic picture and many re...|$|R
