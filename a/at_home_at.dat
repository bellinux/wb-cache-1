5|$|In {{order to}} reach the final, Dunfermline played three matches; one <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>at</b> East End Park and two away from home. Dunfermline scored seven goals and conceded {{only one in the}} rounds before the final, keeping two clean sheets in the process. St Johnstone contested four matches before the final; one <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>at</b> McDiarmid Park and the other three away, scoring ten goals, conceding three and keeping only one clean sheet.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the motivations}} of those Australian's that volunteered {{to fight in}} Russia can only be guessed at, it seems {{unlikely}} to have been political. Regardless, they confirmed a reputation for audacity and courage, winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign, despite their small numbers. Yet Australian involvement was barely noticed <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>at</b> the time and made little difference to {{the outcome of the}} war. Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded, with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|Edward made {{alliances with}} the German king, the Counts of Flanders and Guelders, and the Burgundians, who would attack France from the north. The alliances proved volatile, however, and Edward was facing trouble <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>at</b> the time, both in Wales and Scotland. It {{was not until}} August 1297 that he {{was finally able to}} sail for Flanders, at which time his allies there had already {{suffered}} defeat. The support from Germany never materialised, and Edward was forced to seek peace. His marriage to Margaret in 1299 ended the war, but the whole affair had proven both costly and fruitless for the English.|$|E

5|$|Football tournaments {{for senior}} men's {{national}} teams {{took place in}} six Summer Olympics between 1908 and 1936. The Belgian squad participated in all three Olympic football tournaments in the 1920s and kept the gold medal <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>at</b> the 1920 edition. Apart from the proper national team, two other Belgian delegations appeared at the Olympics. At the 1900 Summer Olympics, a Belgian representation with mainly students won bronze, and at the 2008 edition, Belgium's U-23 selection placed fourth.|$|E
5|$|In 1877, Skopje {{was chosen}} as the capital city of the new Kosovo Vilayet, which {{encompassed}} present-day Kosovo, northwestern Macedonia and the Sanjak of Novi Pazar. In 1905, the city had 32,000 inhabitants, making it the largest of the vilayet, although closely followed by Prizren with its 30,000 inhabitants. Of the Skopje Muslim population of the late Ottoman period German linguist Gustav Weigand noted that though most were Albanians regarded as Turks or Ottomans (Osmanli), they spoke Turkish in public and Albanian <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> <b>At</b> the beginning of the 20th century, local economy was focused on dyeing, weaving, tanning, ironworks and wine and flour processing.|$|E
5|$|To {{regain his}} strength, Edwards {{and his wife}} took a {{carriage}} to a rustic cottage refuge in Arkville in the Catskill Mountains but isolation, plain food and rest yielded little improvement. A physician was called and he informed Mrs. Edwards {{that there would be}} no recovery for her husband from the advanced Bright's disease with complications from chronic pneumonia so she brought him back to New York City. Edwards died <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>at</b> 185 East 116th Street in East Harlem late on June 9, 1891, just hours after returning.|$|E

5|$|In the quarter-finals Dunfermline faced Airdrie United, a {{competitor}} in the Second Division, {{away from home}} at the Excelsior Stadium. The score was goalless at half time but Burchill's two goals {{in the second half}} after 54 and 81 minutes respectively sealed a 2–0 win to progress to the semi-finals. With four teams left in the tournament Dunfermline were drawn to play Ayr United, also of the Second Division, <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>at</b> East End Park. Similar to the previous round, the scoreline was 0–0 for most of the game before Glass scored a late winner for Dunfermline in the 83rd minute to win 1–0 and send Dunfermline into their first Challenge Cup final.|$|E
5|$|Nemo {{stays with}} his father, who later becomes disabled. He {{works in a}} shop and spends his free time <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>at</b> the typewriter, writing a science fiction story about a journey to Mars. At a school dance, he meets Elise and falls in love. A few days later, Nemo goes to Elise's house but sees her with her 22-year-old boyfriend. Frustrated, he speeds away on his motorcycle, has an {{accident}} and is hospitalized in a vegetative state. Though he can perceive the world through his senses, Nemo cannot move or speak. He detects his parents' reunion at his bedside. Nemo tries to remember the movement of {{his fingers on the}} typewriter keyboard and eventually manages to lift a finger as this story line comes to a close.|$|E
5|$|Queen of the South also {{entered the}} first round and were drawn to play Third Division club Peterhead away from home at Balmoor Stadium. Queen of the South {{dominated}} {{the majority of the}} game and scored two late goals in the second half from John O'Neill and Peter Weatherson to progress to the next round as 2–0 winners. In the second round Queen of the South played another Third Division club, Greenock Morton, <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>at</b> Palmerston Park. The game was marred with incidents with Dean Keenan, Colin Reilly and Alex Williams all being sent off for Greenock Morton. Sean O'Connor scored the winning goal for Queen of the South with only seven minutes left to play but shortly before the end sustained an injury from a tackle by Reilly which resulted in his sending off. Queen of the South won the game 1–0 and advanced to the quarter-finals.|$|E

5|$|St Johnstone played another Second Division club, Brechin City, <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>at</b> McDiarmid Park in the quarter-finals, {{taking a}} four-goal {{lead in the}} first half: Kenny Deuchar scored twice and Andy Jackson and David Weatherston made it 4–0 shortly before half time. In the second half, Calum Smith pulled a goal back for Brechin City in the 57th minute to make it 4–1 which was how the score {{remained}} and St Johnstone progressed to the semi-finals. With four teams left in the tournament, St Johnstone travelled to Cappielow to face fellow First Division club Greenock Morton. Both teams scored early in the match; Andy Jackson for St Johnstone in the 10th minute and Brian Graham for Greenock Morton two minutes later to make it 1–1. In the second half, St Johnstone scored two more goals from Peter MacDonald and Rocco Quinn to win 3–1 and advance to the final {{for the first time}} since losing in 1996 to Stranraer.|$|E
5|$|The 2001–02 {{season was}} the 104th season of {{competitive}} football played by Arsenal. Having ended the previous season as FA Cup finalists and league runners-up to Manchester United, the club went one better in this campaign, by completing the domestic double – their second {{in four years}} and third overall. Arsenal won the Premier League by a seven-point margin, were unbeaten {{away from home and}} managed the unique feat of scoring in every league game. They lost only three times in the division, all of which <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> <b>At</b> the Millennium Stadium, Arsenal beat Chelsea 2–0 to win the 2002 FA Cup Final. In Europe however, they fared poorly as they were eliminated in the second group stage of the UEFA Champions League.|$|E
5|$|Women in the Middle Ages were officially {{required}} to be subordinate to some male, whether their father, husband, or other kinsman. Widows, who were often allowed much {{control over their own}} lives, were still restricted legally. Women's work generally consisted of household or other domestically inclined tasks. Peasant women were usually responsible for taking care of the household, child-care, as well as gardening and animal husbandry near the house. They could supplement the household income by spinning or brewing <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> <b>At</b> harvest-time, they were also expected to help with field-work. Townswomen, like peasant women, were responsible for the household, and could also engage in trade. What trades were open to women varied by country and period. Noblewomen were responsible for running a household, and could occasionally be expected to handle estates in the absence of male relatives, but they were usually restricted from participation in military or government affairs. The only role open to women in the Church was that of nuns, as they were unable to become priests.|$|E
