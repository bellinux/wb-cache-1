5000|$|<b>After</b> <b>Airborne</b> School, 92R0P {{recruits}} head to Fort Lee {{to attend}} the 13-week Parachute Rigger Course. The course provides training on inspecting, packing, rigging, recovering, storing, and maintaining air item equipment. It {{is divided into three}} phases. Air Drop Phase - Includes instruction in cargo parachute packing, rigging supplies and equipment for airdrop, types and limitations of aircraft. Students become proficient {{in the use of the}} various technical manuals for rigging airdrop loads. At the conclusion of the instruction, the students participate in an airdrop exercise. They pack the cargo parachutes, rig the loads to be dropped and place the loads in the aircraft. [...] After the airdrop, the students recover the loads and equipment. Aerial Equipment Repair Phase - Trains fundamentals and procedures of inspection, classification, and repair of maintenance of personnel, cargo, extraction parachutes and airdrop equipment to include the service of High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) Automatic Ripcord Release (ARR). Parachute Pack Phase - Is designed to equip students with the working knowledge of inspection and packing procedures relative to personnel, light cargo and extraction parachutes. The student receives concentrated instruction on the troop back parachute. The student is required to jump the parachute he/she packed during the examination. Throughout the course, the student is constantly reminded of the fact that all parachutes must be packed with meticulous care to insure proper functioning. Any malfunction could result in death or in equipment loss.|$|E

30|$|In general, {{isocyanate}} (R-NCO) exposure causes irritation to the skin, mucous membranes, {{eyes and}} respiratory tract (NIOSH 1989). The most commonly reported {{adverse health effects}} <b>after</b> <b>airborne</b> isocyanate exposure is asthma due to sensitisation (Piirilä et al. 2008), where inhaled isocyanates rapidly form conjugates with epithelial lung cell proteins (Wisnewski et al. 1999). Once sensitisation has occurred, even extremely low concentrations of airborne isocyanates can trigger fatal asthma attacks (Henneken et al. 2007).|$|E
40|$|According to the {{aviation}} statistics, tail strike {{incidents and accidents}} are cyclic. Although many tail strikes occurred during takeoff, these are less than during landing cases. Many cases are related on human factors. In my opinion {{it is possible to}} analyze the causes of takeoff tail strikes to some extent. There are major casual factors of tail strike during takeoff such as; (1) Mis-trimmed horizontal stabilizer (2) premature rotation prior to V R (3) Excessive pitch up rate during rotation (4) Improper use of the flight director. Among these causes improper use of flight director is excluded in this paper because it is recommended that pilot should use flight director <b>after</b> <b>airborne.</b> So I analyzed the other three causes as following. Firstly, because mis-trimmed stabilizer is related to center of gravity(CG), the relationship between stabilizer and CG is reviewed. Secondly, concerned premature rotation prior to V...|$|E
40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} A/H 5 N 1 virus can cause {{morbidity and mortality}} in humans but thus far has not acquired {{the ability to be}} transmitted by aerosol or respiratory droplet ("airborne transmission") between humans. To address the concern that the virus could acquire this ability under natural conditions, we genetically modified A/H 5 N 1 virus by site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent serial passage in ferrets. The genetically modified A/H 5 N 1 virus acquired mutations during passage in ferrets, ultimately becoming airborne transmissible in ferrets. None of the recipient ferrets died <b>after</b> <b>airborne</b> infection with the mutant A/H 5 N 1 viruses. Four amino acid substitutions in the host receptor-binding protein hemagglutinin, and one in the polymerase complex protein basic polymerase 2, were consistently present in airborne-transmitted viruses. The transmissible viruses were sensitive to the antiviral drug oseltamivir and reacted well with antisera raised against H 5 influenza vaccine strains. Thus, avian A/H 5 N 1 influenza viruses can acquire the capacity for airborne transmission between mammals without recombination in an intermediate host and therefore constitute a risk for human pandemic influenza...|$|E

40|$|The rapidly {{increasing}} production of engineered nanoparticles has raised questions regarding their environmental impact and their mobility to overcome biological important barriers. Nanoparticles {{were found to}} cross different mammalian barriers, which is summarized under the term translocation. The present work investigates the uptake and translocation of cerium dioxide nanoparticles into maize plants {{as one of the}} major agricultural crops. Nanoparticles were exposed either as aerosol or as suspension. Our study demonstrates that 50 μg of cerium/g of leaves was either adsorbed or incorporated into maize leaves. This amount could not be removed by a washing step and did not depend on closed or open stomata investigated under dark and light exposure conditions. However, no translocation into newly grown leaves was found when cultivating the maize plants <b>after</b> <b>airborne</b> particle exposure. The use of inductively coupled mass spectrometer allowed detection limits of less than 1 ng of cerium/g of leaf. Exposure of plants to well-characterized nanoparticle suspensions in the irrigation water resulted also in no detectable translocation. These findings may indicate that the biological barriers of plants are more resistant against nanoparticle translocation than mammalian barriers...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about how the mode of {{respiratory}} virus transmission determines the dynamics of primary infection and protection from reinfection. Using non-invasive imaging of murine parainfluenza virus 1 (Sendai virus) in living mice, we determined the frequency, timing, dynamics, and virulence of primary infection after contact and airborne transmission, {{as well as the}} tropism and magnitude of reinfection after subsequent challenge. Contact transmission of Sendai virus was 100 % efficient, phenotypically uniform, initiated and grew to robust levels in the upper respiratory tract (URT), later spread to the lungs, grew to a lower level in the lungs than the URT, and protected from reinfection completely in the URT yet only partially in the lungs. Airborne transmission through 7. 6 -cm and 15. 2 -cm separations between donor and recipient mice was 86 %– 100 % efficient. The dynamics of primary infection <b>after</b> <b>airborne</b> transmission varied between individual mice and included the following categories: (a) non-productive transmission, (b) tracheal dominant, (c) tracheal initiated yet respiratory disseminated, and (d) nasopharyngeal initiated yet respiratory disseminated. Any previous exposure to Sendai virus infection protected from mortality and severe morbidity after lethal challenge. Furthermore, a higher level of primary infection in a given respiratory tissue (nasopharynx, trachea, or lungs) was inversely correlated with the level of reinfection in that same tissue. Overall, the mode of transmission determined the dynamics and tropism of primary infection, which in turn governed the level of seroconversion and protection from reinfection. These data are the first description of th...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} 5 different surface conditioning methods on the bond strength of polycarbonate brackets bonded to ceramic surfaces with resin based cement. Six disc-shaped ceramic specimens (feldspathic porcelain) with glazed surfaces were used for each group. The specimens {{were randomly assigned to}} 1 of the following treatment conditions of the ceramic surface: (1) orthophosphoric acid _ primer _ bonding agent, (2) hydrofluoric acid gel _ primer _ bonding agent, (3) tribochemical silica coating (silicon dioxide, 30 _m) _ silane, (4) airborne particle abrasion (aluminum trioxide, 30 _m) _ silane, and (5) airborne particle abrasion (aluminum trioxide, 30 _m) _ silane _ bonding agent. Brackets were bonded to the conditioned ceramic specimens with a light-polymerized resin composite. All specimens were stored in water for 1 week at 37 °C and then thermocycled (1000 cycles, 5 °C to 55 °C, 30 seconds). The shear bond strength values were measured on a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. Brackets treated with silica coating with silanization had significantly greater bond strength values (13. 6 MPa, P _. 01) than brackets treated with orthophosphoric acid (8. 5 MPa). There was no significant difference (P _. 97) between the bond strengths obtained <b>after</b> <b>airborne</b> abrasion with aluminium trioxide particles followed by silanization (12 MPa) and hydrofluoric acid application (11. 2 MPa) (ANOVA and Tukey test). Although brackets conditioned with orthophosphoric acid exhibited only adhesive failures of the luting cement from the ceramic surface, other conditioning methods showed mixed types of failures. Airborne particle abrasion with aluminium trioxide or silica coating followed by silanization gave the most favorable bond strengths. The types of failures observed after debonding indicated that the critical parameter was the strength of the adhesive joint of the luting cement to both the bracket and the ceramic. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was the {{follow-up}} of work place enzyme and detergent dust exposure effects and smoking habit on DNA damage parameters of workers and the evaluation of their antioxidant enzyme activities and lipid peroxidation with regard to bag-filter installation in the work place. Material and Methods: All investigated parameters were studied in a group of 153 workers of enzyme-free detergent production plant (E-free) and a group of 138 workers of enzyme-plus detergent plant (E-plus) and compared with 45 controls 7. 2 years before and 3. 1 years after filter system installation. The following methods were used: antioxidant enzymes by an ultraviolet-visibles spectrophotometer, malondialdehyde (MDA), 8 -hydroxy- 2 &#x 2032;deoxyguanosine (8 OH- 2 &#x 2032;dG) by high-performance liquid chromatography, trace elements by atomic absorption spectroscopy, and comet assay by single cell gel electrophoresis. Results: Compared with controls, significant increases were observed in both detergent-exposed groups with respect to the levels of MDA, antioxidant enzyme activities, and DNA damage parameters, including 8 OH- 2 &#x 2032;dG, endonuclease III-sensitive sites, and DNA strand breaks, with enhancement effect of smoking before filter system installation. After filter installation, besides significant decrease in the detergent and enzyme dust of airborne and oxidative stress indicators, there was improvement in all DNA damage investigated parameters {{at the end of this}} study. The levels of cumulative exposure index of detergent dusts decreased significantly <b>after</b> <b>airborne</b> improvement and showed positive correlation with internal biochemical parameters. Conclusions: We concluded that high levels of enzyme and detergent contents of work place dusts had a cumulative effect and smoking had a synergistic effect on the imbalance of antioxidant status and lipid peroxidation, suggesting that oxidation stress is important in the occurrence and progression of DNA damage over this study. Detergent and enzyme contents in respirable and total dust had the main role and sufficient potential in their genotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} effect of {{airborne}} particle abrasion of metal implant abutments on tensile bond strength (TBS) of TempBond, Retrieve, and Premier implant cements. Materials and Methods: Specimens were designed to replicate a single metal implant crown cemented to both smooth and airborne particle–abraded Osteo-Ti implant abutments with zero degrees of taper. Twenty castings were fabricated and cemented to either a smooth surface abutment (SSA) or to an airborne particle–abraded abutment (AAA). TBS was measured with a 50 -kg load and a crosshead speed of 0. 5 cm/min in a universal testing machine. Each cement was tested 10 times on both abutment types. Results: The mean TBS values (standard deviations, 95 % confidence intervals) of SSAs for TempBond, Retrieve, and Premier cements were 115. 89 N (26. 44, 96. 98 – 134. 81), 134. 43 N (36. 95, 108. 25 – 160. 60), and 132. 51 N (55. 10, 93. 09 – 171. 93), respectively. The corresponding values for AAAs were 129. 69 N (30. 39, 107. 95 – 151. 43), 298. 67 N (80. 36, 241. 19 – 356. 16), and 361. 17 N (133. 23, 265. 86 - 456. 48), respectively. There {{was no significant difference}} in TBS among the dental cements when used with an SSA. Air abrasion of abutments did not increase the TBS of TempBond but significantly increased crown retention with Retrieve and Premier. For SSAs, all failures were adhesive on the abutment surface; for AAAs, mostly cohesive cement failures occurred. Conclusion: The retention of copings cemented with Retrieve or Premier to zero-degree-taper abutments was significantly increased <b>after</b> <b>airborne</b> particle abrasion of the abutments. However, this was not significant when TempBond was used. Airborne particle abrasion of abutments and the use of Retrieve or Premier can be recommended for nonretrievable prostheses. Although TempBond functioned similarly to the two other cements in SSAs, it is advisable to limit its use to provisional prostheses; its long-term performance needs to be assessed clinically...|$|E
40|$|Desert dust {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} ice nucleating particle types in the atmosphere. Tra ditionally, clay minerals were assumed to determine the ice nucleation ability of desert dust and constituted the focus of ice nucleation studies. Only recently some feldspar species were identified to be ice-active at much higher temperatures than clay minerals, redirecting studies to investigate the contribution of feldspar to ice nucleation on desert dust. However, so far no study has shown the atmospheric relevance of this mineral phase. For this study four dust samples were collected <b>after</b> <b>airborne</b> transport in the troposphere from the Sahara to different locations (Crete, the Peloponnese, Canary Islands and the Sinai Peninsula). Additionally, eleven dust samples were collected from the surface from nine of the biggest deserts worldwide. The samples were used to study the ice nucleation behavior specific to different desert dusts. Furthermore we investigated how representative ice nucleation on surface-collected dust is for that in the atmosphere by comparing to the ice nucleation activity of the airborne samples. We used the IMCA-ZINC set-up to form droplets on single aerosol particles which were subsequently exposed to temperatures between 233 - 250 K. Dust particles were collected in parallel on filters for offline cold stage ice nucleation experiments at 253 - 263 K. To help the interpretation of the results from the ice nucleation experiments the mineralogical composition of the dusts was investigated. We found that a higher ice nucleation activity in a given sample can be attributed at 253 K to the K-feldspar content present in this sample whereas at temperatures between 238 - 245 K it is attributed to the sum of feldspar and quartz content present. A high clay content on the other hand is associated with a lower ice nucleation activity of a sample. This confirms the importance of feldspar at T > 250 K and the role of quartz and feldspars determining the ice nucleation activities at lower T as found by earlier studies for monomineral dust surrogates. Furthermore, we find that milling may lead to a decrease in the ice nucleation ability of polymineral samples due to a change in mineralogical composition in the atmospherically relevant size fraction arising from the different hardness and cleavage of individual mineral phases. Comparison of our comprehensive data set to an existing desert dust parameterization confirms its applicability for climate models. Our results suggest that for an improved prediction of the ice nucleation ability of desert dust in the atmosphere, the modelling of emission and atmospheric transport of the feldspar and quartz mineral phases would be key while other minerals are only of minor importance...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the surface of Y-TZP after abrasion with various airborne particles. METHODS: The Y-TZP blanks were cut into 44 discs and sintered according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specimens were treated as follows: (a) control specimens, (b) abraded with 50 μm alumina, (c) abraded with 110 μm alumina, (d) abraded with 30 μm silica-coated alumina, (e) abraded with 110 μm silica-coated alumina, (f) abraded with 110 μm alumina followed by 110 μm silica-coated alumina particles. Airborne abrasion was performed at a pressure of 2. 5 bar for 15 s/cm(2). The Y-TZP was characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). RESULTS: Surface morphology of Y-TZP ceramic was changed <b>after</b> the <b>airborne</b> abrasion process compared to the control specimens. The grain boundaries disappeared and part of the airborne particles are embedded and/or rested on the ceramic surfaces. The elemental composition of the Y-TZP surface <b>after</b> the <b>airborne</b> abrasion process depended on the type and size of these particles. The concentration of Si resulted higher <b>after</b> the <b>airborne</b> abrasion process with 110 μm alumina followed by 110 μm silica-coated alumina particles in comparison to the specimens abraded with 110 μm silica-coated alumina particles. The ratio of elements normalized by yttrium for these specimens was: [Zr]/[Y]/[Al]/[Si]= 15. 2 / 1. 0 / 26. 0 / 73. 6, respectively. CONCLUSION: The change of grain topography occurred during each impact process. Silica nano-particles covered not only loosely the abraded ceramic surface after abrasion process, but the release of kinetic energy in form of thermal energy resulted in melting of the ceramic surface and in the formation of zirconium silicate...|$|R
