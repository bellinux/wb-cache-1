5|$|The {{southern}} half of I-35E in {{the metro}} area took <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>longer</b> to build. Its first section—a short stretch from MN110 north to State Highway 5, including the Lexington Bridge over the Mississippi River—opened in the mid-1960s. Even though the connecting piece of I-35W and I-35 at the southern terminus of I-35E in Burnsville opened in the mid-1960s, {{it was not until the}} mid-1980s that I-35E was completed south of MN110 at Mendota Heights and southbound through Eagan and Apple Valley, where there had been a missing link of I-35E for 20years. Construction was delayed by opposition from nearby residents in Burnsville and from environmentalists over the proposed alignment across Blackhawk Lake. The final plan involved a new alignment avoiding the lake, as well as a less complicated interchange at I-494 in Mendota Heights, eliminating access to MN55 that was part of the earlier plans.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT—Intense hedonic states trigger {{psychological}} pro-cesses {{that are}} designed to attenuate them, and thus intense states may abate more quickly than mild states. Because people are unaware of these psychological processes, they may mis-takenly expect intense states to last longer than mild ones. In Study 1, participants predicted that the more they initially disliked a transgressor, the longer their dislike would last. In Study 2, participants predicted that their dislike for a trans-gressor who hurt them <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> would last <b>longer</b> than their dislike for a transgressor who hurt them a little, but precisely the op-posite was the case. In Study 3, participants predicted that their dislike for a transgressor who hurt them <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> would last <b>longer</b> than their dislike for a transgressor who hurt someone else <b>a</b> <b>lot,</b> but precisely the opposite was the case. These errors of pre-diction are discussed as instances of a more general phenom...|$|R

Discovered - dishevelled and incoherent - wandering behind the lines in France, he possessed no insignia or identification, save for an Australian army hat. He was visibly confused and panicky, unable to give his rank, his battalion or his name. Places in the care of an Australian field hospital, he eventually proffered his name as George Brown. He said that he had enlisted in the AIF from his home in Tasmania and that his regimental number was 2584. None of this was true but, in the absence of any alternative, his file was marked with that name. The staff at Callan Park referred to him as 2 ̆ 7 the unknown patient 2 ̆ 7.

40|$|With reallotment already {{existing}} property units can be changed. Reallotment is mainly {{used to improve}} property division in Sweden. The {{purpose of this study}} is to enlighten what the accepted distance is between farm and forestland lots within the same property when the estate is undergoing reallotment. To answer the purpose of this study cadastral dossiers from reallotments done in five counties were studied. The result of this study shows that the accepted distance is depending on land use of the added <b>lot.</b> <b>A</b> <b>longer</b> distance was accepted when forestland was added compared with farmland. There was no proven statistical link between area on the added lot and distance to the origin estate. There were differences regarding the longest accepted distance. The longest distance occurred in Jämtland County and was 54, 0 kilometers while the longest distance in Örebro County was 12, 0 kilometers. The measured distance to the added lot for 90 percent of the reallotments in this study was 9, 9 kilometers or shorter. The occurring differences shown in this study indicate that the law can be interpreted differently by the cadastral surveyors in Sweden...|$|R
25|$|Bengali and Odia {{style is}} worn without any pleats.

The modern style of wearing a saree originates from the Tagore family.

50|$|Sevastova {{is known}} as a {{tactical}} all-round player who uses varied shots to win points. She possesses consistent and accurate groundstrokes, with both wings capable of producing winners. She possesses a accurate serve, that can reach 110mph (177km/h), but her second serve isn't as strong. She also moves well around the court well and her footwork is good as well. She personally states that her backhand is her favourite shot. Possibly her biggest asset is her variety and resilience on court. She approaches the net <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to finish <b>a</b> <b>lot,</b> and one of her best shots is her drop shots and slices, which are very difficult to retrieve. She is also known to fight for every point and can endure <b>lots</b> of <b>longer</b> rallies. This was clearly evident in her win over Garbine Muguruza at the 2016 US Open.|$|R
500|$|Several more of Blair's {{former colleagues}} and {{political}} opponents also {{commented on the}} book. Former Conservative minister Norman Tebbit wrote in The Daily Telegraph, [...] "A Journey seems {{to be dominated by}} Blair's anxiety {{to be seen as a}} great political leader who changed his country for the better. In fact it is, as I suppose all such books are to some extent, entirely about justifying himself and blaming others." [...] However, Tebbit admitted he had not read the book at the time of writing about it and based his opinion on media coverage. Writing in The Guardian, Alistair Darling, who was Chancellor under Gordon Brown, said that he [...] "read with wry amusement how Tony Blair felt after much agonising that he couldn't sack his Chancellor. History has a habit of repeating itself." [...] He concluded that the book was [...] "a good read and shows us what can be done when we have confidence, clarity and a clear sense of purpose: we can win and change the country for the better." [...] Labour Member of Parliament Tom Harris said that the book [...] "will be a reminder that opposition doesn't have to be permanent, and that great things can be accomplished by a Labour government, but only if we have a leader capable of appealing to voters beyond our own party's core." [...] Of Blair, he said, [...] "There are still many, many Labour Party members who remember Blair as an election-winning genius who, in office, was popular for <b>an</b> awful <b>lot</b> <b>longer</b> than he was unpopular." [...] Ed Miliband, then vying for the vacant position of Labour Party leader, said on the day of publication, [...] "I think it is time to move on from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson and to move on from the New Labour establishment and that is the candidate that I am at this election who can best turn the page. I think frankly most members of the public will want us to turn the page." [...] He was elected as Leader of the Labour Party several weeks later.|$|R
40|$|During {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a great focus on the climate changes within the media. More or less every day more {{newspaper}} articles are presented about the global warming issue and the effect on us human race. Climate models predict higher temperatures and more rain {{in the northern part of}} Europe. It is also predicted that the weather will become more extreme e. g. it will rain <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> during <b>longer</b> periods than has been the norm. If these predictions are correct, the amount of water that is going to be transported away in streams and rivers will increase and so also will the subsoil water level. The latter increases the risk for landslides in areas with fine grained soils. An early warning system that is able to alert people before a landslide take place would be of great interest. The purpose of this work is to develop a complete real-time displacement monitoring system based on observations from several GPS-receivers that could be used as an early warning system. Due to the complex correlation structure of the traditionally used double differences, an alternative method based on undifferenced observations is used. Theoretically this approach shows some advantages and simplifies the correlative structure of observables compared to the double differenced method. A complete model for the undifferenced approach is presented in this thesis including its software implementation. A displacement detection system includes not only the positioning algorithms, but also methods to detect if any displacement occurs. There are many methods available to discriminate displacements, which are used in the traditional control of manufacturing processes. Several of these methods are compared in this thesis, such as the Shewhart chart, different Weighted Moving Average (WMA) charts and the CUmulative SUMmation (CUSUM). Practical tests show that it is possible to detect an abrupt shift on sub centimetre level at the same epoch as the shift occurs. Smaller shifts are also detectable with the applied approach but with a slightly longer detection time. QC 2010062...|$|R
