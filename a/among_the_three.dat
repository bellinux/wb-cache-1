5|$|Due to {{the dot-com}} boom, stable {{monetary}} policy under Alan Greenspan, and reduced social welfare spending, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history, ending in 2001. Beginning in 1994, the U.S. {{entered into the}} North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), linking 450 million people producing $17 trillion worth of goods and services. The goal of the agreement was to eliminate trade and investment barriers among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico by January 1, 2008. Trade <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> partners has soared since NAFTA went into force.|$|E
5|$|Hays {{made the}} {{construction}} of the mainline his priority, failing to develop feeder lines. CNoR and CPR joined forces to gain control of the prairie traffic. The competition <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> railroads led to Canada's ending up with three transcontinental railways instead of one. This was to result in the GTP's being starved of traffic; even though it was arguably the best of the three, it ultimately failed to attract enough freight to make it profitable.|$|E

Mysteries of Westgate met with mixed reviews; the game's plot and small amount of spoken dialogue were criticized by reviewers, while its music and low price for overall content were praised.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{give their}} {{name to the}} Pelecaniformes, an order which has a varied taxonomic history. Tropicbirds, darters, cormorants, gannets, boobies and frigatebirds, all {{traditional}} members of the order, have since been reclassified: tropicbirds into their own order, Phaethontiformes, and the remainder into Suliformes. In their place, herons, ibises, spoonbills, the hamerkop and the shoebill have now been transferred into Pelecaniformes.

The study used two transgenic lines of potato, both with the GNA gene inserted. They were grown in the same conditions as the non-genetically modified parent plant. According to Pusztai, the potatoes were not substantially equivalent, {{as one of the}} transgenic lines contained 20 percent less protein than the other, and the starch and sugar contents varied by up to 20 percent <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> lines. Pusztai claimed that these differences were reason enough to discontinue further experimentation.|$|E

The result was a treaty that created a condominium <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> powers, allowing all of them access to the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{discovered}} the holotype female from an M. vindex nest on 23 March 1955 northwest from Wagin at Badjanning Rocks, Western Australia. The specimen is currently {{housed in the}} Western Australian Museum in Perth. Two dealated paratype females were also collected with the holotype, looking very similar to each other except for the mandibles and colouration. The mandibular dentition varies <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>three,</b> {{and one of the}} paratypes is darker than the holotype. In 1991, a published journal reviewing the species groups assigned M. inquilina to the M. cephalotes species group. However, entomologists placed it in the M. gulosa species group one month after placing it in the M. cephalotes species group.|$|E
5|$|Contador faced {{repeated}} {{challenges from}} Riccardo Riccò and Danilo Di Luca in the race's final week. They {{were separated by}} {{less than a minute}} after stage 15, and though Di Luca would falter slightly in the Giro's second individual time trial, the time gap <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> of them was just 21 seconds heading in to the Giro's final mountain stage. Di Luca faltered further in that last mountain stage, losing almost five minutes and any chance to repeat as Giro champion, but Contador and Riccò finished together and were separated by only four seconds going into the Giro's final stage, another individual time trial. Contador's superior time trial skills provided the difference in the Giro's finale. Though he finished 11th on the stage, he gained almost two minutes over Riccò, winning the Giro overall without taking any individual stage.|$|E

5|$|Despite a shaky {{start at}} the anchor desk, Jennings' {{broadcast}} began to climb in the ratings. Jennings was praised for his performance during the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, when he anchored ABC's coverage of the event for 11 straight hours. By 1989, competition <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> nightly newscasts had risen to fever pitch. When the Loma Prieta earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay area, media pundits praised Jennings and ABC News for their prompt on-air response, while criticizing the delayed reaction of Tom Brokaw and NBC News. The next month, Brokaw redeemed himself by scooping the other networks with news {{of the fall of}} the Berlin Wall. It was World News Tonight, however, that ended the year at the top; ABC's evening newscast spent the last 13 weeks of the year in first place, and its average ratings for the entire year beat CBS for the first time.|$|E

The scarcity of lots means {{that the number of}} single-family dwellings is not likely to increase; a reverse process is taking place: old wooden houses are being demolished, making room for new residential and commercial constructions.
