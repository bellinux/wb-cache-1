[...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E

A year later he signed Rangers' first black player Mark Walters. In 1989, Souness signed Mo Johnston, a former Celtic player and openly Catholic. This was Rangers' first signing of an openly Catholic player since the unwritten policy was introduced, though there had been claims in the media that it was done to counter a FIFA inquiry into Old Firm sectarianism. According to Johnston's agent Bill McMurdo, Souness had been eager to sign a Catholic player, and had negotiated in secret with [...] "four or five" [...] before signing Johnston. At a press conference following his signing, the English Rangers players attended however the Scottish players boycotted it. The chairman of the Rangers Supporters Association stated [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> Rangers, {{there will be a lot}} of people handing back their season tickets. I don't want to see a Roman Catholic at Ibrox. Rangers have always stood for one thing and the majority of the support have been brought up with the idea of a true blue Rangers team." [...] As he predicted, Rangers fans responded by burning their season tickets; Celtic supporters claimed Johnston had betrayed Catholicism, calling him [...] "Judas".

Belaid was quickly rushed to the nearest clinic but the doctors couldn't save him and he was pronounced dead at the moment. Current secretary general of Belaid's party and leader of the Popular Front, Ziad Lakhdhar, said in a statement: [...] "Chokri Belaid was killed today by four bullets to the head and chest ... doctors told us that he has died. This is <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> Tunisia". It was also reported that Belaid had received several death threats prior to his assassination with many of his supporters blaming Ennahda for failing to protect him following those threats and an incident targeting fellow party members a week earlier. Belaid had always attacked the [...] "Leagues for the Protection of the Revolution" [...] (LPR), a government-aligned nationwide organization that claims to root out remnants of Ben Ali's regime but are accused of thuggish behaviour towards opposition groups, and he claimed that there are groups inside Ennahda that incite violence and that the LPR's committees are tools used by the government and its allied Islamists to get rid of the party's leftist coalition. The night before the incident, he appeared in a political talk show on Tunisia's Nessma TV and said; [...] "Rashid Ghannushi considers the leagues to be the conscience of the nation, so the defense of the authors of violence is clear. All those who oppose Ennahda become the targets of violence." [...] Following his assassination, thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the Interior Ministry building in Tunis carrying Belaid's coffin and shouted [...] "The people demand the fall of the regime". The day turned violent when some of the protesters threw rocks with the police using tear gas to disperse the rallies.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the latter}} half of 1937, Ribbentrop had championed the idea of an {{alliance}} between Germany, Italy, and Japan that would partition the British Empire among them. After signing the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact, Ribbentrop expanded on this idea for an Axis alliance to include the Soviet Union to form a Eurasian bloc that would destroy maritime states such as Britain. The German historian Klaus Hildebrand argued that besides Hitler's foreign policy programme, there were three other factions within the Nazi Party who had alternative foreign policy programmes, whom Hildebrand designated the agrarians, the revolutionary socialists, and the Wilhelmine Imperialists. Another German diplomatic historian, Wolfgang Michalka argued that there was a fourth alternative to the Nazi foreign policy programme, and that was Ribbentrop's concept of a Euro-Asiatic bloc comprising the four totalitarian states of Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy and Japan. Unlike the other factions, Ribbentrop's foreign policy programme {{was the only one that}} Hitler allowed to be executed during the years 1939–41, though it was more due to the temporary bankruptcy of Hitler's own foreign policy programme that he had laid down in Mein Kampf and Zweites Buch following the failure to achieve an alliance with Britain, than to a genuine change of mind. Ribbentrop's foreign policy conceptions differed from Hitler's in that Ribbentrop's concept of international relations owed more to the traditional Wilhelmine Machtpolitik than to Hitler's racist and Social Darwinist vision of different [...] "races" [...] locked in a merciless and endless struggle over Lebensraum. The different foreign-policy conceptions held by Hitler and Ribbentrop were illustrated in their reaction to the Fall of Singapore in 1942: Ribbentrop wanted this great British defeat to be a day of celebration in Germany, whereas Hitler forbade any celebrations on the grounds that Singapore represented <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> the principles of white supremacy. Another area of difference was Ribbentrop's obsessive hatred for Britain – which he saw as the main enemy – and view of the Soviet Union as an important ally in the anti-British struggle. Hitler saw the alliance with the Soviet Union as only tactical, and was nowhere as anti-British as his Foreign Minister.|$|E

[...] Legendary shock rocker, Alice Cooper released the following statement: [...] "Michael Jackson was easily as influential as James Brown, and that's saying a lot. We had Vincent Price in common. I used him first on 'Welcome To My Nightmare' in 1975, and he later used him on 'Thriller'. Nobody moved like Michael, he was truly the King of Pop." [...] Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen, who worked with Jackson during the recording of Thriller, stated: [...] "I am really shocked; as I'm sure the world is, to hear the news. I had the pleasure of working with Michael on 'Beat It' back in '83 — one of my fondest memories in my career. Michael will be missed and may he rest in peace." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May stated in his official website: [...] "Hard to know what to say — what to feel. I find myself wondering what might have happened on his tour... The number of dates in the U.K. that he had committed to was insane. I did have a feeling it was impossible, but I was so shocked to hear that he went so suddenly. Very sad. Of course, I still think of him as a boy — he used to come and see us (Queen) play when we were on tour in the States, and he and Freddie Mercury became close friends, close enough to record a couple of tracks together at Michael's house. Tracks which have never seen the light of day. Michael was the boy star of the Jackson Five, and always the most screamed at. I remember in their show, they tried very hard to make all the brothers equal in the presentation, but it was abundantly obvious that all most of the girl fans really wanted to see was little Michael. It was Michael who heard our track 'Another One Bites the Dust' when he came to see us on 'The Game' tour ... and told us we were mad if we didn't release it as a single." [...] Former Guns n' Roses guitarist Slash, who played guitar on Jackson's single [...] "Give In to Me" [...] stated: [...] "Really sad news about Michael. He was a talent from on high."

I lived with Jermaine for three weeks last year (during the filming of the second season of CMT's hit series, 'Gone Country'), and we talked about his brother frequently. He said to me, 'When you cut up my brother, you're cutting up me'. I feel for the Jackson family, because I know all too well how they feel. Unfortunately." [...] Geoff Tate of Queensrÿche stated: [...] "I grew up listening to Michael Jackson, watching him and his brothers perform on television.
