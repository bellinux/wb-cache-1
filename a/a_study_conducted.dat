5|$|<b>A</b> <b>study</b> <b>conducted</b> by a United States child psychiatrist, Dr Kyle D.

Mothers reassure toddlers when they become frustrated while fathers encourage them to manage their frustration. This helps the children {{learn to deal with}} stress and frustration. A long-term study Pruett conducted proved that a father's active involvement with his children, from birth to adolescence, promotes greater emotional balance, stronger curiosity and a stronger sense of self-assurance in the child.|$|E

5|$|Heritage turkey breeds {{have been}} a focus for the {{organization}} since 1997, when a survey showed only 1,335 breeding stock birds of all breeds. <b>A</b> <b>study</b> <b>conducted</b> by the Conservancy and Virginia Tech concluded that heritage turkey breeds had stronger immune systems than those breeds typically used by industrial growers, and as such {{were more likely to}} survive disease epidemics. This study and other programs increased awareness of heritage turkey breeds and by 2003 the breeding population stood at 4,275 turkeys of all breeds. By 2007 this had grown to more than 10,000 birds and 17 breeds were no longer considered to be almost extinct. As of 2010, the number is estimated to be close to 15,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the astrologer and {{psychologist}} Michel Gauquelin {{stated that}} {{though he had}} failed to find evidence that supported indicators like zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology, he did find positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some planets and success in professions that astrology traditionally associates with those planets. The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the Mars effect. <b>A</b> <b>study</b> <b>conducted</b> by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence. They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study.|$|E
5|$|Otters {{may prefer}} {{to feed on}} crustaceans, {{especially}} crayfish (Cambarus, Pacifasticus, and others) more than fish where they are locally and seasonally plentiful. In Georgia, crayfish accounted for two-thirds of the prey in the summer diet, and their remnants were present in 98% of the summer spraint. In the winter, crayfish made up one-third of the otter's diet. <b>A</b> <b>study</b> <b>conducted</b> on North American river otters in a southwestern Arkansas swamp identified a correlation between crayfish consumption, fish consumption, and water levels.|$|E

5|$|Research {{has shown}} that the {{consumption}} of hot chocolate can be positive to one's health. <b>A</b> <b>study</b> <b>conducted</b> by Cornell University {{has shown that}} hot chocolate contains more antioxidants than wine and tea, therefore reducing the risk of heart disease. In a single serving of cocoa, the researchers found 611 milligrams of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) and 564 milligrams of epicatechin equivalents (ECE), compared with 340 milligrams of GAE and 163 milligrams of ECE in red wine, and 165 milligrams of GAE and 47 milligrams of ECE in green tea. Chang Yong Lee, the professor and researcher at Cornell who conducted the study, revealed that larger amounts of antioxidants are released when the beverage is heated.|$|E
5|$|S. ciliata is a benthic {{carnivore}} {{that feeds}} predominantly on polychaetes and various crustaceans. Like {{other species of}} Sillago, the diet of the species {{is related to the}} size and age of the individual, with three distinct size classes identified in <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>conducted</b> in Botany Bay, NSW. The smallest fish of 0–10cm take large amount of amphipods and few polychaetes, while fish between 11 and 20cm consume mostly neried polychaetes and few amphipods. The largest fish over 21cm take large amounts of bivalve molluscs and shrimps of the genus Callianassa.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>study</b> <b>conducted</b> at the Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS), at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) {{published}} in 2014 {{found that many}} car dealers are less than enthusiastic about plug-in vehicles. ITS conducted 43 interviews with six automakers and 20 new car dealers selling plug-in vehicles in California’s major metro markets. The study also analyzed national and state-level J.D. Power 2013 Sales Satisfaction Index (SSI) study data on customer satisfaction with new car dealerships and Tesla retail stores. The researchers found that buyers of plug-in electric vehicles were significantly less satisfied and rated the dealer purchase experience much lower than buyers of non-premium conventional cars, while Tesla Motors earned industry-high scores. According to the findings, plug-in buyers expect more from dealers than conventional buyers, including product knowledge and support that extends beyond traditional offerings.|$|E

5|$|Fish are {{the primary}} {{component}} of the river otter's diet throughout the year. Every study done on the food habits of the river otter has identified varying fish species as being the primary component of its diet. For instance, an Alberta, Canada study involved the collection and analysis of 1,191 samples of river otter scats collected during each season. Fish remnants were found present in 91.9% of the scat samples. Moreover, a western Oregon study revealed fish remains were present in 80% of the 103 digestive tracts examined. Crustaceans (crayfish), where regionally available, are the second-most important prey for otters. Crustaceans may even be consumed more than fish. For example, <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>conducted</b> in a central California marshland indicated crayfish formed nearly 100% of the river otter's diet at certain times of the year. However, river otters, as foragers, will immediately take advantage of other prey when readily obtainable. Other prey consumed by river otters includes fruits, reptiles, amphibians, birds (most especially moulting ducks which render the birds flightless and thus makes them easier to capture), aquatic insects, small mammals, and mollusks.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, she was {{selected}} by People and the entertainment news program Access Hollywood {{as one of the}} year's best-dressed female stars. The yellow dress she wore to that year's Golden Globe Awards was widely acclaimed. <b>A</b> <b>study</b> <b>conducted</b> by E-Poll Market Research showed that Witherspoon was the most likable female celebrity of 2007. That same year, Witherspoon established herself as the highest-paid actress in the American film industry, earning $15 to $20 million per film. In recent years, however, her appearance in a number of movies that fared badly at the box office caused a turnabout in her status, and she has been noted {{as one of the most}} overpaid actors in Hollywood in 2011, 2012 and 2013. In April 2011, Witherspoon ranked 3rd on the 22nd annual People's Most Beautiful issue.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>conducted</b> by , UC Davis, US Forest Service, and the Hoopa Tribe {{showed that}} fishers in California {{were exposed to}} and killed by {{anticoagulant}} rodenticides associated with marijuana cultivation. In this study, 79% of fishers that were tested in California were exposed {{to an average of}} 1.61 different anticoagulant rodenticides and four fishers died directly attributed to these toxicants. A 2015 follow-up study building on this data determined that the trend of exposure and mortality from these toxicants increased to 85%, that California fishers were now exposed to an average of 1.73 different anticoagulant rodenticides, and that nine more fishers died, bringing the total to 13. The extent of marijuana cultivation within fishers' home ranges was highlighted in a 2013 study focusing on fisher survival and impacts from marijuana cultivation within the Sierra National Forest. Research showed that fishers had an average of 5.3 individual grow sites within their home range. One fisher had 16 individual grow sites within its territory.|$|E
