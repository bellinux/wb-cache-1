With the {{continuous}} development of printing technology and printing equipments, {{the quality of}} newsprint should be improved to meet with all the real demands. <b>Acrylamide</b> <b>copolymer</b> is used in paper-making as process aid and function aid which can effectively improve paper printing adaptability. Preparation and application of polyacrylamide via aqueous copolymerization was studied as dry strength agent in this paper.

40|$|Polymer {{polyelectrolyte}} hydrogel composites of {{acrylic acid}} and <b>acrylamide</b> <b>copolymer</b> filled with different amounts of bentonite (from 1 to 5 wt. %) were synthesized. Collapse kinetics of hydrogel composites was studied in solutions of different concentrations of polyvalent metal salts {{at a constant}} temperature of 25 °C. The mass of water given away from hydrogels into the solution was determined by gravimetric method. It {{has been found that}} the presence of bentonite in the polyelectrolyte hydrogel composites prevents to some extent collapse in electrolyte solutions, due to steric and electrostatic interactions between the filler particles. These interactions preclude further collapse of hydrogels. The Peleg's kinetic model, most precisely describing experimental data, was applied to calculation of kinetic constants of polymer hydrogels collapse. It is shown that the initial collapse rate and the kinetic constant of collapse and swelling depend non-monotonically on the concentration (ionic strength) in the electrolyte solution. At the identical concentration of salts in the solution the kinetic constant of hydrogel collapse is independent of the radius of ions of metals of the studied salts...|$|E

X-ray diffraction showed that compared with commonly used KCl, the water-soluble complex of PAAT with 2 wt% ionic liquid 1 -methyl- 3 -H-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (HmimBF 4) could remarkably reduce the d-spacing of sodium montmorillonite in water from 19. 24 to 13. 16 Å and effectively inhibit clay swelling.

Incorporation of nickel-binding nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) side chains into the tyrosineamide copolymers allowed specific immobilization of His 6 -tagged GFP.

40|$|The {{electrophoresis}} of hydrophobic proteins underwent significant development {{during the}} last decade. In native gel electrophoresis, the induced charge shift, the involvement of mild detergents {{as well as a}} constant ionic strength in the electrophoresis, overcame the difficulty of the low solubility and aggregation of the hydrophobic proteins, and critically improved the results of their native PAGE [H.

In isoelectric focusing electrophoresis, the most difficult one for hydrophobic proteins, the including of mild detergents, the use of diluted samples with immobilized pH gradient, as well as a more hydrophobic media such as polyethylene glycol methacrylate– <b>acrylamide</b> <b>copolymer</b> improved the resolution and yield of these proteins [J.

A notable increase in cloud point (CP) was observed as the concentration of the polymer solutions was lowered, though the effect of concentration on CP of pure p(NIPAAm), was relatively small. In all cases, the elevation of CP was most evident at low concentration between 0. 1 wt. % and 0. 01 wt. %. Both at fixed and decreasing concentrations of p(NIPAAm) solutions, a direct relationship between molecular weight and CP was observed, where CP shifted to higher temperatures as the molecular weight increased. The polymer coil size in solution below the CP in the concentration range studied was between 4 and 11 nm for all the polymers in this study, irrespective of the concentration and of the fraction of hydroxy monomer incorporated, but increased dramatically above the CP. CPs obtained by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) were lower than those obtained by UV absorbance as the latter is less sensitive. Copolymer compositions with more than 13 % hydroxy monomer showed no thermal hysteresis, in contrast to pure p(NIPAAm).

The toxicity of two cationic <b>acrylamide</b> <b>copolymers</b> with different chain branching degree was evaluated. Standard ecotoxicity tests were conducted with microalgae and daphnids. The susceptibility of Corbicula fluminea, as a biofouling bivalve, was also evaluated. The effect of polyelectrolyte on the test media viscosity and the polymer chain size distributions under the experimental conditions were also examined. The susceptibility of the microalgae to both polymers was similar.

The more branched polymer was significantly less toxic to both daphnids and the bivalves, which could be linked to the distinctive features of its bimodal size chain distribution.

Microwave heating {{has emerged as a}} powerful technique to promote a variety of chemical reactions, offering reduced pollution, low cost and offer high yields together with simplicity in processing and handling. On the other hand, copolymers containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments are drawing considerable attention because of their possible use in biological systems. Various copolymer compositions can produce {{a very large number of}} different arrangements, producing materials of varying chemical and physical properties. Thus, the hydrophilicity of copolymers can be modified by changing the amount of incorporated itaconic anhydride. Results A series of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and <b>acrylamide</b> (AA) <b>copolymers</b> containing itaconic anhydride (ITA) were synthesized by microwave irradiation employing a multimode reactor (Synthos 3000 Aton Paar, GmbH, 1400 W maximum magnetron) as well as conventional method. The thermal properties of the copolymers were evaluated by different techniques. Structure-thermal property correlation based on changing the itaconic anhydride ratio was demonstrated. Results revealed that the incorporation of itaconic anhydride into the polymeric backbone of all series affect the thermal stability of copolymers. In addition, the use of the microwave method offers high molecular weight copolymers which lead eventually to an increase in thermal stability. Conclusions Microwave irradiation method showed advantages for the produced copolymers compared to that prepared by conventional method, where it can offer a copolymer in short time, high yield, more pure compounds and more thermally stable copolymers, rather than conventional method. Also, microwave irradiation method gives higher molecular weight due to prevention of the chain transfer. Moreover, as the itaconic anhydride content increases the thermal stability and T g increase due to the decrease in the crystallinity. </p...|$|R

It was shown that the size, size distribution and colloidal stability of the miniemulsion droplets were extremely dependent {{on the nature of}} the oil phase, the monomer content and the surfactant concentration. The less water-soluble the hydrocarbon template and the higher the monomer content, the better the droplet stability. The successful formation of nanocapsules with the targeted core-shell morphology (i. e., a liquid core surrounded by a solid shell) was evidenced by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. Both nanocapsules and nanoparticles were produced by polymerization of the miniemulsion droplets. The proportion of nanoparticles increased with increasing monomer concentration in the oil phase. These undesirable nanoparticles were presumably formed by homogeneous nucleation as we showed that micellar nucleation could be neglected under our experimental conditions even for high surfactant concentrations. The introduction of -methacryloyloxy propyl trimethoxysilane was considered to be the main reason for homogeneous nucleation...|$|R

This phenomenon {{is on the}} molecular level analogous with a phase transition (collapse) in hydrogels. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy {{was used for the}} study. Results showed that with increasing content of <b>acrylamide</b> in the <b>copolymer</b> the transition tempe- rature is shifted to higher values, the transition is more gradual and smaller fraction of copolymer is phase separated. The same behaviour was found for higher content of ethanol or acetone in the solvent. If this content and the content of acrylamide is very high, the phase transition in dependence on the composition of solvent appears. The relaxation experiments showed that after the {{phase separation}} a part of solvent molecules remains bound to globular structures and its mobility is rescticted.

40|$|Poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) {{copolymers}} {{of different}} compositions were synthesized and characterized. The copolymers were statistical {{with a relatively}} high percentage of acrylamide units, as determined by $^{ 13 }C$ NMR. Reactivity ratios calculated by the Finemann-Ross and Kelen-Tudos methods showed that the copolymers were random with a reactivity ratio of $r_{AM}= 3. 76 $ and $r_{AA}= 0. 28 $ The photolytic and photocatalytic degradation of the copolymers and the homopolymers was conducted {{in the presence of}} combustion-synthesized nano anatase titania. The degradation of the copolymer in the presence of combustion-synthesized titania was significantly higher than that observed in the presence of commercial titania, Degussa P- 25. The degradation was modeled by using continuous distribution kinetics by following the time evolution of molecular weight distribution. The degradation follows a two step mechanism, wherein the rapid first step comprises the scission of weak acrylic acid units along the chain which is followed by the breakage of relatively strong acrylamide units. The rate constants for the weak and strong links follow a linear trend with the percentage of acrylic acid and <b>acrylamide</b> in the <b>copolymer,</b> respectively. This linear variation can be correlated with a similar trend observed for the activation energies obtained for the pyrolytic degradation of the polymers...|$|R
