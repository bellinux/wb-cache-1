5000|$|The word {{diffusion}} {{derives from}} the Latin word, diffundere, which means [...] "to spread out" [...] (a substance that “spreads out” is moving from an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>concentration</b> to an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> low concentration).|$|R
5000|$|Diffusion is the net {{movement}} of material from an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>concentration</b> to an <b>area</b> with lower concentration. The difference of concentration {{between the two}} areas is often termed as the concentration gradient, and diffusion will continue until this gradient has been eliminated. Since diffusion moves materials from an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> <b>concentration</b> to an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> lower concentration, it is described as moving solutes [...] "down the concentration gradient" [...] (compared with active transport, which often moves material from <b>area</b> <b>of</b> low <b>concentration</b> to <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> <b>concentration,</b> and therefore referred to as moving the material [...] "against the concentration gradient"). However, in many cases (e.g. passive drug transport) {{the driving force of}} passive transport can not be simplified to the concentration gradient. If there are different solutions at {{the two sides of the}} membrane with different equilibrium solubility of the drug, the difference in degree of saturation is the driving force of passive membrane transport. It is also true for supersaturated solutions which are more and more important owing to the spreading of the application of amorphous solid dispersions for drug bioavailability enhancement.|$|R

The 1976 court decision resulted in HUD and CHA agreeing to mediate segregation imposed on Chicago public housing residents by providing Section 8 voucher assistance to more than 7,000 black families. The Section 8 assistance provided blacks the opportunity to move out of racially segregated areas and into mixed neighborhoods. Policymakers theorized that housing mobility would provide residents with access to [...] "social capital", including ties to informal job networks. About seventy-five percent of the Gautreaux households were required to move to predominately white suburban neighborhoods while the remaining 25% were allowed to move to urban areas with 30% or more black residents.|$|E
50|$|The {{reasons for}} this are twofold. For one, {{substances}} in nature {{have a tendency to}} move from <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>concentration</b> to areas of low concentration, as is evident by dropping a drop of food coloring in a glass of water. It does not aggregate, but begins to move from the highly concentrated areas (the colored areas) to the areas of low concentration (clear areas). Second, large groups of predominantly positively charged or negatively charged particles will naturally repel each other. This is demonstrated by attempting to push the two positive poles or two negative poles of a magnet together. Depending on the strength of the magnet, the repulsion may be so strong {{that it is impossible to}} push the magnets together unless aided by machinery. Proton motive force does work on the system by bringing ions back towards the epidermis of the root or surface of a root hair along with the protons. From the surface of the soil/root interface, specific carriers, like H+/K+ symporters allow the specific ions to come into the cell and the out the plasmodesmata/symporters/antiporters of the side of the cell facing away from the soil so that the essential element can make its way up the plant to the area it is needed so that it may supply the plant with important nutrients that are vital to the plant's being able to reach maturity.|$|E
5000|$|Active {{transport}} is {{the movement}} of a substance across a membrane against its concentration gradient. This is usually to accumulate high concentrations of molecules that a cell needs, such as glucose or amino acids. When the lipid bilayer is impermeable to the molecule needing transport, active transport is also necessary. If the process uses chemical energy, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), it is called primary active transport. Secondary active transport {{involves the use of}} an electrochemical gradient, and does not use energy produced in the cell. Unlike channel proteins which only transport substances through membranes passively, carrier proteins can transport ions and molecules either passively through facilitated diffusion, or via secondary active transport. A carrier protein is required to move particles from areas of low concentration to <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>concentration.</b> These carrier proteins have receptors that bind to a specific molecule (substrate) needing transport. The molecule or ion to be transported (the substrate) must first bind at a binding site at the carrier molecule, with a certain binding affinity. Following binding, and while the binding site is facing the same way, the carrier will capture or occlude (take in and retain) the substrate within its molecular structure and cause an internal translocation so that the opening in the protein now faces {{the other side of the}} plasma membrane. The carrier protein substrate is released at that site, according to its binding affinity there.|$|E

After each fishing operation, catch composition was quantified and precise {{information about the}} position of the catch was taken between 2008 and 2011. Macromedusae records have been systemized in order to analyze the spatial-temporal distribution, the areas of concentration of the identified species and their relationship with other components of the bycatch. Catch composition analyzed in 986 fishing tows, demonstrated that the participation of these organisms ranged from 6 - 16 %, and the hydromedusae Rhacostoma atlanticum L. Agassiz, 1851 and Olindias sambaquiensis Müller, 1861 were the most abundant and widely distributed species. R. atlanticum was recorded between 20 and 140 m deep while O. sambaquiensis presented registers in shallower waters between 10 and 70 m.
