5|$|His father Nobile Carlo Buonaparte was an attorney, and {{was named}} Corsica's {{representative}} {{to the court of}} Louis XVI in 1777.

5|$|Norway {{prohibited}} {{nuclear warheads}} {{to be stored}} on its soil, preventing Banak from serving in <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> a base for US nuclear-armed bombers. NATO's military interest for Banak peaked during the late 1960s. Increased range of Soviet aircraft during the 1970s diminished the need for troops in Finnmark; combined with Norwegian tension and nuclear policies, this caused the United States to favor Vestfjorden and Troms over Banak as the primary areas of defense.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} other factors are less closely linked to COPD. The risk is greater in those who are poor, {{although}} it is not clear if this is due to poverty itself or other risk factors associated with poverty, such as air pollution and malnutrition. There is tentative evidence that those with asthma and airway hyperreactivity are at increased risk of COPD. Birth factors such as low birth weight may also play <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> do a number of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Respiratory infections such as pneumonia do not appear to increase the risk of COPD, at least in adults.|$|E
5|$|After her repairs were completed, {{the ship}} {{spent most of}} 1941 on convoy escort duties before she was {{transferred}} to the Far East after the start of the Pacific War in December. Exeter was generally tasked with escorting convoys to and from Singapore during the Malayan Campaign and continued on those duties in early February 1942 as the Japanese prepared to invade the Dutch East Indies. Later that month, she was assigned to the Striking Force of the joint American-British-Dutch-Australian Command and took on {{a more active role in}} the defence of the Dutch islands. The culmination of this was her participation in the Battle of the Java Sea later in the month as the Allies attempted to intercept Japanese invasion convoys. Exeter was crippled early in the battle and did not play much of <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> she was forced to withdraw. Two days later, she attempted to escape inbound Japanese forces, but was intercepted and sunk by Japanese ships at the beginning of March in the Second Battle of the Java Sea.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century {{very few}} castles were well {{maintained}} by their owners. Many royal castles were receiving insufficient investment {{to allow them}} to be maintained – roofs leaked, stone work crumbled, lead or wood was stolen. The Crown was increasingly selective about which royal castles it maintained, with others left to decay. By the 15th century only Windsor, Leeds, Rockingham and Moor End were kept up as comfortable accommodation; Nottingham and York formed the backbone for royal authority in the north, and Chester, Gloucester and Bristol forming the equivalents in the west. Even major fortifications such as the castles of North Wales and the border castles of Carlisle, Bamburgh and Newcastle upon Tyne saw funding and maintenance reduced. Many royal castles continued to have <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> the county gaol, with the gatehouse frequently being used as the principal facility.|$|E

5|$|Ciocia {{writes that}} {{with half the}} novel taking place in {{theatrical}} settings, Nan may be playing <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> character in her own life or a play on a stage set in a theatre or the streets of London. She starts as a spectator watching Kitty onstage, and later with Kitty, watching how men move and behave to improve their act. She becomes a performer, with Kitty, as a renter and again for the predatory Diana and her friends. Finally she takes the role of director as she assists and impels Ralph to perform his speech. At this point, {{she is able to}} reconcile her identity and the story ends. Waters consciously chose to create a complicated plot, and was impressed with Iris Murdoch's claim that she herself had entire stories worked out well in advance of writing them, a method Waters used with Tipping the Velvet.|$|E
5|$|Cory {{served as}} the film's main director, as he had more {{experience}} with animation, comedy, and children's entertainment, while Todd served as co-director.

Tony Leech, {{who had worked with}} the Edwards brothers on Chillicothe, was initially hired as an editor, but gained story input as well. He eventually proved to be so valuable to the production that he was given <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> co-director.|$|E
5|$|Developed from ponies {{taken to}} Iceland by Norse {{settlers}} in the 9th and 10th centuries, the breed is mentioned in literature and historical records throughout Icelandic history; the first reference to a named horse appears in the 12th century. Horses were venerated in Norse mythology, a custom brought to Iceland by the country's earliest settlers. Selective breeding over the centuries has developed the breed into its current form. Natural selection has also played <b>a</b> <b>role,</b> <b>as</b> the harsh Icelandic climate eliminated many horses through cold and starvation. In the 1780s, much of the breed was wiped out {{in the aftermath of}} a volcanic eruption at Laki. The first breed society for the Icelandic horse was created in Iceland in 1904, and today the breed is represented by organizations in 19different nations, organized under a parent association, the International Federation of Icelandic Horse Associations.|$|E
