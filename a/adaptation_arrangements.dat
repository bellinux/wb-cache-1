40|$|Group project {{works are}} common in higher education. Assessment of group work is a {{complicated}} challenge, especially in inter-disciplinary courses/ units of study. Previous studies by the first author revealed that self assessment and peer assessment of group works are useful arrangements to augment the teacher assessments in such courses. Our literature review revealed that diverse approaches are being considered for group work assessment in higher education and relevant <b>adaptation</b> <b>arrangements</b> are deemed as useful. Hence, we commenced a focused research to benchmark good practices and develop rational frameworks for inter-disciplinary group work assessment in higher education. Our research is focused on developing effective assessment arrangements for inter-disciplinary group work in higher education. Main aim {{of this research is}} to explore for effective integration of teacher assessments with students' assessments such as (a) intra-group peer and self assessments and (b) inter-group peer assessments. This paper covers key details of a case-study related to intra-group peer and self assessments of group work in an inter-disciplinary cohort. A set of quantitative explorations were considered in this case-study explorations, which include: (i) verifying student competencies for self assessment and intra-group peer assessments in inter-disciplinary group works [...] -to rationalise assessment frameworks; (ii) comparing the intra-group assessments by male and female students to find whether there is any significant difference i. e. gender bias; (iii) comparing the intra-group assessments of students from different years of undergraduate studies (i. e. Year 2, Year 3 and Year 4) to determine whether there is any bias with respect to level of students in the cohort. In a 'seed funded' pilot research at Swinburne University of Technology, the first author reviewed specific problems in group work assessments to develop suitable rational arrangements, e. g. templates and protocols for peer assessments. By customising some of the relevant frameworks, the second author led an exploratory case-study in a group work based subject that had a large undergraduate cohort from different faculties at the National University of Singapore. 108 valid datasets (i. e. 53 males and 55 females) from the case-study were used for specific quantitative research explorations, e. g. correlations and ANOVA. This case-study research revealed interesting observations such as (a) significant correlation between self assessment and intra-group peer assessment by students and (b) significant difference between Year 2 and Year 3 students' intra-group peer assessment ratings. Furthermore, there is no gender bias, i. e. no significant difference between male and female ratings observed in this case study. Intra-group peer and self assessments are useful supplements to the teacher assessments in interdisciplinary cohorts, which can be beneficial to both teachers and students. However, rational frameworks and relevant protocols can be useful for facilitating harmony in implementation. Also, case-study findings are bounded by limitations and assumptions of the study. Hence, further research is required to establish theories and strategies based on case-study findings...|$|E

However, the key difference between learner-centred and traditional curriculum development is that, in the former, the curriculum is a collaborative effort between teachers and learners, since learners are closely involved {{in the decision-making process}} regarding the content of the curriculum and how it is taught.

40|$|The present special {{recognition}} of musical education at Spanish schools {{is based upon}} the approval of a law from 1970. However, this law was not implemented. The reason was the lack of a specialist teacher in the field. The implementation depended in many instances on voluntary initiatives and sporadically on teacher’s sensitivity to musical matters. In this article we wanted to examine the work which has been done by the Spanish musician and teacher Baltasar Bibiloni. His work, as a teacher in the field of teacher’s training and musical <b>adaptations</b> and <b>arrangements</b> for primary education, will become a benchmark for music on the Balearic Islands. Furthermore, it will be an important factor within legal constraints, which are currently being discussed.   Focal points of this article are three aspects of its ideology: the importance of musical education in schools, specific proposals for implementation and teachers willing and able to apply it.

50|$|In music, {{transcription}} {{can mean}} notating a piece or a sound which was previously unnotated, as, for example, an improvised jazz solo. When a musician is tasked with creating sheet music from a recording and they {{write down the}} notes {{that make up the}} song in music notation, it is said that they created a musical transcription of that recording. Transcription may also mean rewriting a piece of music, either solo or ensemble, for another instrument or other instruments than which it was originally intended. The Beethoven Symphonies by Franz Liszt are a good example. Transcription in this sense is sometimes called arrangement, although strictly speaking transcriptions are faithful <b>adaptations,</b> whereas <b>arrangements</b> change significant aspects of the original piece. Further examples of music transcription include ethnomusicological notation of oral traditions of folk music, such as Béla Bartók's and Ralph Vaughan Williams' collections of the national folk music of Hungary and England respectively. The French composer Olivier Messiaen transcribed birdsong in the wild, and incorporated it into many of his compositions, for example his Catalogue d'oiseaux for solo piano. Transcription of this nature involves scale degree recognition and harmonic analysis, both of which the transcriber will need relative or perfect pitch to perform.|$|R

40|$|Hospital {{emergency}} services, initially {{created to}} accommodate acute and serious diseases, are now confronted by multiple requirements. They {{must not only}} respond to vital emergency situations, but also fill the gaps in the health and social services provided for benign conditions or social problems. Given the phenomena of chronic congestion, hospital policies are moving towards a restriction on intake for a core of serious diseases. Triage protocols permit the ranking of priorities {{on the basis of}} pre-established clinical criteria. But behind this normative model for priority setting stands a much more complex reality, susceptible to <b>adaptations</b> and <b>arrangements</b> that depart from strict official standards and respond to the particularity of the situations encountered. Based on a three-year immersive study in a hospital emergency service, this current paper shows that the management of priorities, far from depending only on regulatory standards, adapts and changes according to the habits and uses of hospital medicine. Faced with multiple requirements, professionals are confronted with genuine moral dilemmas and daily contradictions between solidarity, humanity, patient triage, managing priorities and economic imperatives. On a daily basis, emergency caregivers attempt to prioritize their actions by reconciling legal and organizational constraints related to their function. They face many ethical challenges that question the meaning of emergency, the responsibility towards risk and the challenges of the hospital institution...|$|R
50|$|In {{architectural}} terms, the functionalist {{approach and}} {{the dominance of}} an ordered aesthetic of the InterContinental Vienna are {{in keeping with the}} international modernism of the post-war decades. The building is considered an example of Functionalism in its original form. Carl Appel approached the design problem systematically; he studied the building’s future operational processes and logistics, and then he developed a framework and began the design process. The framework, the ordered vocabulary and the systematic floor plans are all reflected in the building’s appearance. Therefore, to this day, the InterContinental Vienna can still maintain its position as a representative of International Functionalism. The T-shaped building massing continues to work well, and no changes have been made to it. The ordered facade tells of the activities situated behind it: after fifty years, the twelve levels of guest rooms are still places to sleep and spend a short period of time. The hotel lobby, other meeting spaces and the ballroom must facilitate communication in a stately fashion and are therefore particularly generous in scale; Appel went all out here and achieved an ambiance specific to Vienna. The contextual <b>adaptations,</b> architectural <b>arrangement</b> of the facade, and the ultra-modern interior design also make the building typical of Vienna in the 1950s and 1960s - when progress and belief in the future were accompanied by respect for local flair and rejection of dogmatic Functionalism.|$|R

5000|$|Although each {{return of}} the theme with its {{chromatic}} falling bass accompaniment is instantly recognizable, Bach's allotting of parts between the two manuals (Oberwerk and Rückpositiv) can occasionally obscure Vivaldi's sharp distinction between solo and ripieno players. Various elements of Vivaldi's string writing, that would normally be outside Bach's musical vocabulary for organ compositions, are included directly or with slight <b>adaptations</b> in Bach's <b>arrangement.</b> As well as the dissonant suspensions in the opening quaver figures, these include quaver figures in parallel thirds, descending chromatic fourths, and rippling semidemiquavers and semiquavers in the left hand as an equivalent for the tremolo string accompaniment. Towards {{the end of the}} piece, Bach fills out the accompaniment in the final virtuosic semiquaver solo episode by adding imitative quaver figures in the lower parts.

40|$|The recent Irish {{economic}} and financial crisis had significant impacts {{on the performance of}} the labour market and was also associated with major changes to labour market policies and institutions. Drawing on Douglass Northâs concept of adaptive efficiency, this thesis contributes to the political economy literature on how the key institutional changes came about given the conflicting interests and understandings among key labour market stakeholders. The current theoretical discord over Labour Market Institutions (LMIs) is central. The thesis is organised into five core chapters. In the first, I set the context for institutional change by establishing distinct phases of full employment, crisis, and then recovery discernible from the data. In chapter two I review the relevant theoretical literature on LMIs and suggest a systems approach, supported by the language of New Institutional Economics, which offers a much needed methodology of LMI development over time. Chapter three describes the arrangement of LMIs which constituted the Irish labour market system pre-crisis. Chapter four documents the reforms seen and describes the post-crisis system. Providing the core empirical contribution of the thesis, in chapter five I test the explanatory power of the theoretical framework through interviews with the key labour market stakeholders responsible for the structural adaptation from the pre-crisis to post-crisis system. This chapter suggests an explanation of the political economy of that structural <b>adaptation</b> of <b>arrangements</b> and the role of assumptions from economic theory in their bargaining. European structural reform {{as it relates to the}} labour market occurs within a political-economy context, with the localisation of an identifiable body of general LMI theory largely determining institutional outcomes...|$|R
