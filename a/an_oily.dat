5|$|Anatidae {{includes}} the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to <b>an</b> <b>oily</b> coating.|$|E
5|$|Characteristic {{cells with}} <b>an</b> <b>oily</b> content (gloeocystidia) {{are found in}} the hymenium. In Russulaceae, these show a {{positive}} colour reaction when treated with sulfoaldehydes (sulfovanillin is mostly used). They are also present in the hyphal sheath of ectomycorrhizal roots colonised by Russulaceae.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands are {{microscopic}} exocrine glands in {{the skin}} that secrete <b>an</b> <b>oily</b> or waxy matter, called sebum, to lubricate and waterproof the skin and hair of mammals. In humans, they occur in the greatest number on the face and scalp, but also on {{all parts of the}} skin except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The type of secretion of the sebaceous glands is referred to as holocrine.|$|E

60|$|We {{had taken}} up an oil-stove once, but “never again.” It had been like living in an oil-shop that week. It oozed. I never saw {{such a thing as}} paraffine oil is to ooze. We kept it in the nose of the boat, and, from there, it oozed down to the rudder, {{impregnating}} the whole boat and everything in it on its way, and it oozed over the river, and saturated the scenery and spoilt the atmosphere. Sometimes <b>a</b> westerly <b>oily</b> wind blew, and at other times <b>an</b> easterly <b>oily</b> wind, and sometimes it blew <b>a</b> northerly <b>oily</b> wind, and maybe <b>a</b> southerly <b>oily</b> wind; but whether it came from the Arctic snows, or was raised in the waste of the desert sands, it came alike to us laden with the fragrance of paraffine oil.|$|R

5|$|The areolar glands {{are in the}} areola that {{surrounds}} the nipple in the female breast. These glands secrete <b>an</b> <b>oily</b> fluid that lubricates the nipple, and also secrete volatile compounds that are thought {{to serve as an}} olfactory stimulus for the newborn. During pregnancy and lactation these glands, also called Montgomery's glands, become enlarged.|$|E
5|$|By 1942, {{there were}} {{proposals}} for completely buried flame fougasses {{to be used}} as oil mines but by then the emergency was over. Almost all flame fougasses were removed {{before the end of the}} war and in most instances even the slightest traces of their original locations have disappeared. A few instances were missed, and their remains have been found. For example, the rusty remnants of a four-barrel battery, one of which still contained <b>an</b> <b>oily</b> residue, were discovered in 2010 in West Sussex.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans swim {{well with}} their strong legs and their webbed feet. They rub {{the backs of}} their heads on their preen glands to pick up <b>an</b> <b>oily</b> secretion, which they {{transfer}} to their plumage to waterproof it. Holding their wings only loosely against their bodies, pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below the water surface. They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter – rippling the skin of the throat and pouch with the bill open to promote evaporative cooling. They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks and in shallow water.|$|E
60|$|Anybody but Ginger Dick and Peter Russet or a fool would ha' {{known better}} than to do such a thing, but old Isaac 'ad got such <b>a</b> <b>oily</b> tongue and seemed so {{fair-minded}} about wot 'e called moderate drinking that they never thought wot they was letting themselves in for, and when they took their pay--close on sixteen pounds each--they put the odd change in their pockets and 'anded the rest over to him.|$|R
50|$|Dodecylbenzene is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C12H25C6H5.Dodecylbenzene is a colorless liquid with <b>a</b> weak <b>oily</b> odor. Floats on water.|$|R

5|$|The {{feathers}} are outgrowths of the epidermis and {{are found}} in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin. Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near {{the base of the}} tail. This produces <b>an</b> <b>oily</b> secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens. There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on the tips of the toes.|$|E
5|$|Some scutes {{contain a}} single pore {{known as an}} {{integumentary}} sense organ. Crocodiles and gharials have these on large parts of their bodies, while alligators and caimans only have them on the head. Their exact function is not fully understood, {{but it has been}} suggested that they may be mechanosensory organs. Another possibility is that they may produce <b>an</b> <b>oily</b> secretion that prevents mud from adhering to the skin. There are prominent paired integumentary glands in skin folds on the throat, and others in the side walls of the cloaca. Various functions for these have been suggested. They may play a part in communication, as indirect evidence suggest that they secrete pheromones used in courtship or nesting. The skin of crocodilians is tough and can withstand damage from conspecifics, and the immune system is effective enough to heal wounds within a few days.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of baleen {{whales are}} {{relatively}} small for their size and are positioned {{near the end of}} the mouth. This is probably because they feed on slow or immobile prey, combined with the fact that most sunlight does not pass , and hence they do not need acute vision. A whale's eye is adapted for seeing both in the euphotic and aphotic zones by increasing or decreasing the pupil's size to prevent damage to the eye. As opposed to land mammals which have a flattened lens, whales have a spherical lens. The retina is surrounded by a reflective layer of cells (tapetum lucidum), which bounces light back at the retina, enhancing eyesight in dark areas. However, light is bent more near the surface of the eye when in air as opposed to water; consequently, they can see much better in the air than in the water. The eyeballs are protected by a thick outer layer to prevent abrasions, and <b>an</b> <b>oily</b> fluid (instead of tears) on the surface of the eye. Baleen whales appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones.|$|E

5|$|The {{storm petrel}} nests in crevices and burrows, {{sometimes}} shared with other seabirds or rabbits, and lays a single white egg, usually on bare soil. The adults share the lengthy incubation and both feed the chick, {{which is not}} normally brooded after the first week. This bird is strongly migratory, spending the northern hemisphere winter mainly off the coasts of South Africa and Namibia, with some birds stopping in the seas adjoining West Africa, and a few remaining near their Mediterranean breeding islands. This petrel is strictly oceanic outside the breeding season. It feeds on small fish, squid and zooplankton while pattering on the sea's surface, and can find oily edible items by smell. The food is converted in the bird's stomach to <b>an</b> <b>oily</b> orange liquid which is regurgitated when the chick is fed. Although usually silent at sea, the storm petrel has a chattering call given by both members of a pair in their courtship flight, and the male has a purring song given from the breeding chamber.|$|E
5|$|The typical prey {{consists}} of surface organisms such as small fish, squid, crustaceans and jellyfish. The storm petrel will also eat offal and oily food, often located by smell, and will follow ships. In the Atlantic, {{more than half}} the food items are zooplankton and the fish caught include small herring and sprats; whale carcasses are scavenged where available. During digestion, the plankton is quickly converted to <b>an</b> <b>oily</b> orange liquid that owes its colour to carotenoids. Larger prey items take longer to digest. The oil, rich in vitamin A, is produced by a large gland in the stomach. The Mediterranean subspecies' diet is mainly fish, particularly Mediterranean sand eels. Petrels also catch opossum shrimps from waters close to the colony. Bluefin tuna farms are exploited on the Maltese island of Filfla; birds from the large local colony feed on the unwashed food fed to the farmed tuna, a mixture of fish, squid and prawns which produces a sizeable oily slick. Small numbers of insects are caught near breeding colonies, and some plant material, including angiosperm seeds and sorrel, has been found in the stomach contents. A study on Leach's storm petrel, which consumes similar items, showed that the petrels were snipping pieces off plant leaves in flight, but it could not be confirmed that this was in the course of catching insects. Nasal glands remove excess salt from seawater consumed by the petrel as a concentrated solution excreted through the nostrils.|$|E

25|$|The beaver's fur {{consists}} of long, coarse outer hairs and short, fine inner hairs (see Double coat). The fur has {{a range of}} colors, but usually is dark brown. Scent glands near the genitals secrete <b>an</b> <b>oily</b> substance known as castoreum, which the beaver uses to waterproof its fur.|$|E
