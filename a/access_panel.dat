25|$|Bladder tanks, bag tanks or fuel cells, are {{reinforced}} rubberised bags {{installed in}} a section of aircraft structure designed to accommodate fuel. The bladder is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or <b>access</b> <b>panel,</b> and is secured by means of snap fasteners or cord and loops inside the compartment. Many high-performance light aircraft, helicopters and some smaller turboprop aircraft use bladder tanks.|$|E
25|$|On 22 August 1985, British Airtours Flight 28M {{caught fire}} after an aborted take off at Manchester Airport {{while on a}} charter flight to the Greek island of Corfu. The fuel <b>access</b> <b>panel</b> on the aircraft's {{fuselage}} was pierced by {{a part of the}} compressor that had been ejected from the port engine {{as a result of a}} malfunction. The fire quickly engulfed the area around the rear of the plane filling the cabin with toxic fumes. Fifty-three passengers and two crew members died as a result - most of them dying of asphyxiation after inhaling the fumes.|$|E
500|$|After awakening, {{the crew}} {{set to work}} {{preparing}} for the mission's third spacewalk, one that was considered the most challenging and uncertain, yet {{had some of the}} highest priority items scheduled. The tasks were to remove the obsolete Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR), originally installed during STS-61 to correct the spherical aberration of Hubble's mirror, and install the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), and to repair the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). [...] The ACS failed in June 2006 due to an electrical issue, and after being restored partially, failed again in 2007 due to an electrical short. The ACS was not designed to be serviced or repaired in space, so the task was {{considered one of the most}} challenging of the mission. After running into various snags in the first two spacewalks, managers on the ground were prepared to see unexpected issues arise during the complicated repair work. The spacewalk began at 13:35 UTC, and Grunsfeld and Feustel had no problems. The pair worked through their timeline so efficiently that they were over an hour ahead at one point. After removing COSTAR and stowing it in the orbiter's payload bay, they installed COS, and then moved on to the ACS repair. Using specially designed tools, they removed an <b>access</b> <b>panel,</b> replaced the camera's four circuit boards, and installed a new power supply.|$|E

2500|$|Regular {{inflight}} {{failures of}} the equally experimental Westinghouse XJ-40 turbojet.

To investigate expected sample differences in drop-out rates, non-response, and data quality, closed and open-ended questions of varying levels of sensitiveness were employed. The main findings were that the two <b>access</b> <b>panels</b> lead to lower item non-response, but especially when sensitive questions were asked, data quality problems were revealed. Moreover, the access panelists showed a tendency to take short-cuts in the response process and to edit their answers in favour of social desirability...|$|R
