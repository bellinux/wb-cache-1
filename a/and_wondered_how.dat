500|$|Parambrata Chatterjee {{said in an}} {{interview}} that he did not identify with the Rana character, owing to the difference between his own urban upbringing and Rana's rural background. Chatterjee visited police stations and did some research [...] "on their work, mindset and other relevant things" [...] to prepare for the role. The character Khan was envisaged as a ruthless, arrogant, expletive-spewing officer who cares nothing about the emotional or social consequences of his behaviour. Siddiqui said that he was surprised on being offered the role, <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> he could portray the arrogance needed for the character. Ghosh built Khan as a character with lean physical build but full of mental strength, loyalty and patriotism. Khan smokes a relatively cheap brand of cigarette (Gold Flake) despite his high official post; Siddiqui had smoked that brand of cigarette throughout his struggling days in Bollywood and thereafter.|$|E
500|$|Hesketh was {{influenced}} {{in the early}} planning stages by his friends, including mill owners Samuel Fielden and Benjamin Whitworth. They pointed out that mill workers would not wish to make day trips to the seaside all year round, <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> {{the people of the}} new town would be occupied during the winter months. They encouraged Hesketh to build a new port; because charges at Liverpool were on the rise, and there were no reasonable alternatives for Manchester mill owners, both Whitworth and Fielden agreed that they would make good use of a port on the Fylde coast. Hesketh soon found that he {{was not the only one}} thinking of extending the railway, or of building a new port. He had competition from the residents of Lytham, a village about [...] south of Rossall, at the mouth of the River Ribble. They were already planning the formation of the Preston Port Company; Hesketh acted quickly and applied to the official railway committee to have a port built on the River Wyre. The committee agreed to hear all applications.|$|E

500|$|... "Adrift" [...] first {{surfaced}} on February 2007, {{before the}} airing of [...] "First Strike". By March it was confirmed {{to be the}} first of a two-part opening for the fourth season along with [...] "Lifeline" [...] and would be similar in style to [...] "Progeny" [...] and [...] "The Real World". The producers kept trying {{to find new ways to}} [...] "out-do" [...] the efforts of the previous seasons, which they described was [...] "different" [...] to them, since they introduced more of a balance between team-based and character-based episodes. After the completion of [...] "First Strike", the producers thought it was the biggest episode they have ever done, <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> the fourth season would top that. During the writing stages, Martin Gero wanted the episode to [...] "tee up" [...] with the last episode of the season, and hence wanted the episode to become part of a story-arc for the entire season. Gero also wanted the episode to have [...] "no down time" [...] for the characters like the previous season premieres. After Zelenka gets injured, a scene where a Puddle Jumper was originally meant to pick them both up. However, having a Jumper set nearby in an Atlantis set would not be practical enough, and was cut. He also wrote to have Sheppard in an uneased state while forced to take command of Atlantis. The scene where McKay and Zelenka converse and finish each other's sentences were parallel to the arguing between Gero and Wood while working together on set. He considered the scene between Teyla and Weir to be the cliffhanger, but was changed to the following scene, as Gero felt that would be the better cliffhanger, similar to the one for [...] "The Return, Part 1".|$|E
2500|$|After the exhibit, he {{continued}} on to Vitebsk, where {{he planned to}} stay {{only long enough to}} marry Bella. However, after a few weeks, the First World War began, closing the Russian border for an indefinite period. A year later he married Bella Rosenfeld and they had their first child, Ida. Before the marriage, Chagall had difficulty convincing Bella's parents that he would be a suitable husband for their daughter. They were worried about her marrying a painter from a poor family <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> he would support her. Becoming a successful artist now became a goal and inspiration. According to Lewis, [...] "he euphoric paintings of this time, which show the young couple floating balloon-like over Vitebsk—its wooden buildings faceted in the Delaunay manner—are the most lighthearted of his career". His wedding pictures were also a subject he would return to in later years as he thought about this period of his life.|$|E
2500|$|After Hamlet {{came to a}} {{close in}} August 1964, Burton and Taylor {{continued}} making films together. The first film after their marriage, The Sandpiper, was poorly received but still became a commercially successful venture. According to Bragg, the films they made during the mid-1960s contained a lot of innuendos that referred directly to their private lives. Burton went on to star opposite Claire Bloom and Oskar Werner in The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965), a Cold War espionage story about a British Intelligence agent, Alec Leamas (Burton), who is sent to East Germany on a mission to find and expose a mole working within his organisation for an East German Intelligence officer, Hans-Dieter Mundt (Peter van Eyck). Martin Ritt, the film's director and producer, wanted Burton's character to exhibit more anonymity, which meant no display of eloquent speeches or intense emotional moments. Bragg believed this decision worried Burton, as he had generated his reputation as an actor with those exact traits, <b>and</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> the film's would turn out. Ritt, a non-drinker, was displeased with Burton's drinking habits as he felt it [...] "lacked a certain discipline" [...] and expected the same level of commitment from him as everyone else during filming. In spite of their differences, Alpert notes that the film transpired well. Based on the 1963 novel of the same name by John le Carré, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold garnered positive reviews, with Fernando F. Croce of Slant Magazine describing Burton's performance as more of [...] "tragic patsy than swashbuckler" [...] and believed his scenes with Werner [...] "have sharp doses of suspicion, cynicism and sadness". Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader called the film [...] "Grim, monotonous, and rather facile", he found Burton's role had [...] "some honest poignancy". Variety thought Burton fitted [...] "neatly into the role of the apparently burned out British agent". Burton also made a brief appearance the same year in Clive Donner's comedy What's New Pussycat? as a man who meets the womaniser Michael James (O'Toole) in a bar.|$|E
