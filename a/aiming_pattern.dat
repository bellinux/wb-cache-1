40|$|Handheld {{scanning}} is a prevalent industrial {{task that}} {{is prone to}} injury due to the repetitive motion of the task. Studies conducted with Rochester Institute of Technology and Honeywell have sought to discover the ergonomic and efficiency benefits of various scanning technologies and methods. One factor not fully investigated in these earlier works {{is the effect of}} training on the proper use of scanners. This thesis study compares trained and untrained user performance and ergonomics during a series of scanning tasks using a hand held omni-directional scanner. Comparison is based on such variables as target type (image that is scanned), <b>aiming</b> <b>pattern</b> (image projected from scanner) and time stress (self-paced versus time stress paced). Through this study is the potential to assess the value of training on efficiency and ergonomics during hand held scanner use. 	A trained and an untrained group (each consisting of eight subjects) performed scanning tasks daily for ten days. Wrist postures and task completion times were recorded throughout the study as well as perceived comfort and usability. Results show that the untrained group tended to have greater wrist deviations and thus poorer ergonomics overall. With the exception of the first day, the trained and untrained groups did not differ in terms of efficiency. As a result of this first day difference, level of training seemed to affect efficiency over time resulting in a quick learning curve for the untrained group. There was a significant aim pattern-target type relationship for both training groups in terms of ergonomics and efficiency. Results suggest aim pattern preference was a function of training level. Under time stress, the effect on ergonomics depended on wrist posture and training level, but the trained group tended to have a more detrimental effect to ergonomics than the untrained group. As expected, efficiency increased under time stress, but time stress had no significant effect on perceived usability and comfort...|$|E

50|$|Ion track {{technology}} is a deep cutting tool with a resolution limit around 8 nm applicable to radiation resistant minerals, glasses and polymers. It is capable to generate holes in thin films without any development process. Structural depth can be defined either by ion range or by material thickness. Aspect ratios up to several 104 can be reached. The technique can shape and texture materials at a defined inclination angle. Random pattern, single-ion track structures and <b>aimed</b> <b>pattern</b> consisting of individual single tracks can be generated.|$|R

40|$|<b>Aim</b> <b>Patterns</b> of high {{biodiversity}} among less mobile organisms throughout isolated locations {{suggest that}} passive dispersal importantly contributes to bio-diversity. We examined {{the contribution of}} waterbirds to the dispersal of plant seeds and macroinvertebrates between aquatic wetlands. Birds are renowned vectors for seeds of terrestrial plants, but less is known about their role in more dispersal-dependent aquatic systems. We therefore performed a meta-analysis on bird-mediated endozoochorous dispersal of aquatic species. Location Our review included studies that collected data world-wide. Methods We analysed data from 81 peer-reviewed publications on endozo-ochorous dispersal of aquatic plant seeds and macroinvertebrates by waterbirds. Results In total, 36 % of 1581 waterbird droppings collected in the field con-tained one or more intact propagules, with macroinvertebrates found almost as frequently as plant seeds. Positive droppings contained on average 3. 3 intact propagules, of which one-third were viable. In 728 trials from 17 publishe...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{definitions}} {{of what a}} pattern is. A nice general definition from [1] is: A pattern is a named nugget of insight that conveys {{the essence of a}} proven solution to a recurring problem within a certain context amidst competing concerns. For over a decade the patterns movement in software engineering has been seeking to discover and document these insights so that others can benefit from them. To this <b>aim</b> <b>patterns</b> are often presented in a formal style called a pattern language: A pattern language guides a designer by providing workable so-lutions to all of the problems known to arise in the course of design. It is a sequence of bits of knowledge written in a style and arranged in an order which leads a designer to ask (and answer) the right questions at the right time. [2] Finally we should note that patterns are eminently practical. In [5]...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores {{potential}} {{contributions of}} regional material flow accounting to {{the characterization of}} environmental pressures. With this <b>aim,</b> <b>patterns</b> of material extraction, trade, consumption, and productivity for the Spanish regions were studied within the 1996 - 2010 period. The main methodological variation as compared to whole-country based approaches is the inclusion of interregional trade, which can be separately assessed from the international exchanges. Each region was additionally profiled regarding its commercial exchanges {{with the rest of}} the regions and the rest of the world and the related environmental pressures. Given its magnitude, interregional trade is a significant source of environmental pressure. Most of the exchanges occur across regions and different extractive and trading patterns also arise at this scale. These differences are particularly great for construction minerals, which in Spain represent the largest share of extracted and consumed materials but do not cover long distances, so their impact is visible mainly at the regional level. During the housing bubble, economic growth did not improve material productivity. © 2015 American Chemical SocietyPeer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The art of papper cutting for an <b>aimed</b> <b>pattern</b> {{is called}} senshi or kirigami, {{and has a}} long history {{especially}} in china. Traditionally, those patterns have represented familiar objects and scenes, and the art has generally been relegated to the realm of popular craftsmanship. In my study I use a circular colored paper, fold it first on a diameter and then fold the semi-circle twice each at 60 degrees to obtain a six-fold fan shape. Then draw a simple shap on it. The shap has to be made of a few straight Lines. Use scissors to cut the contour Line of the shape. The geometoric pattern that emerges when you unfold the paper has multiple symmetry, with the same basic shape (always six of them) ""holding hands"" with earch other to form a circle. What pattern will appear out of what basic shape? This will always be an interesting question to ask in a classroom.
