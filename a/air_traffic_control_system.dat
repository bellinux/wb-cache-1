Meanwhile, packages {{can be delivered}} through FedEx at the Kamloops Airport, while custom and security services are provided by Canada Border Services Agency and Garda Security Screening. There is a radio navigation aid provided at the Kamloops Airport which is used by pilots on aircraft coming from other nearby airports to determine their location.

25|$|While the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> saw {{significant}} improvement with {{the implementation of}} SIVAM in the northern portion of the country, there were many warning signs that the system as a whole was heading towards an untenable situation. In 2003, the Brazilian Air Force warned of the need for upgraded equipment and additional funding. For three years, DECEA, the Air Force department in charge of air traffic control budget requests were denied. The government's Tribunal de Contas da União (Union Accounting Tribunal), an agency similar to the US Government Accountability Office, issued a report after the crisis which echoed the FAB's concerns, stating that a lack of planning and underfunding of the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> by the federal government was to blame for the crisis.|$|E

Agreement was reached in July 1955, but an impasse arose between Toronto and Ottawa over the terms of the agreement. The City of Toronto wanted the estimates of the spending to be done at the Island, before it would turn over its title. The Government of Canada wanted the title before giving its estimates and committing to the spending at Malton. The Government of Canada planned to spend $22 million at Malton for new runways and a new terminal, and $3 million at the Island, including extend a runway, an air traffic control tower, and a new hangar. The impasse was finally settled in 1957. Dredging of the Western Gap was needed to lower the depth of the channel for the soon-to-open St. Lawrence Seaway and the dredged materials would be used to expand the area of the airport for the extended runway. Dredging began in 1958, the runway construction began in 1959 and was finished in 1960.|$|E
