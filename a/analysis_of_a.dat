5|$|His {{increasing}} interest in mineralogy {{at this time}} is also apparent from the titles of two books he authored between 1803 and 1809. The first was a two volume work that appeared in 1804 entitled A Practical Essay on the Analysis of Minerals, which was reissued in 1808 as A Manual of Analytical Mineralogy. In 1809 he published <b>Analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Course of Lectures on Mineralogy. Beginning in 1808, while at the Surrey Institution, Accum also published, {{a series of articles}} on the chemical properties and composition of mineral water in Alexander Tilloch's Philosophical Journal.|$|E

They are also used to summarise conserved protein sequence motifs. The use of single letters to indicate sets of similar residues is similar to the use of abbreviation codes for degenerate bases.|$|E

5|$|Simonsohn {{also raised}} the {{possibility}} of reverse causality in the case of Anseel and Duyck's <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large data set consisting of Belgians' last names and the companies they work for. Anseel and Duyck concluded that people tend to choose to work for companies that match their initial.But Simonsohn suspected that, likeWalt Disney working for Disney, many people work for companies named after themselves or a family member. When he controlled for reverse causality in a large US data set, he could not see any evidence for people choosing to work for companies matching their initial.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. In the lab, people disproportionately favor brands matching their initials. An <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately large number of people donate to disaster relief following hurricanes with names sharing their initial letter (e.g. Kate and Kevin following Hurricane Katrina). Studies that investigate the impact of name-letter matching on bigger life decisions (where to live, whom to marry, which occupation to take on) are controversial.|$|E

5|$|The book , co-written by {{the three}} bodyguards fired the {{previous}} year, was published on August 1. It was the first exposé to detail Presley's years of drug misuse. He was devastated by the book and tried unsuccessfully to halt its release by offering money to the publishers. By this point, he suffered from multiple ailments: glaucoma, high blood pressure, liver damage, and an enlarged colon, each aggravated—and possibly caused—by drug abuse. Genetic <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hair sample in 2014 found evidence of genetic variants that could have caused his glaucoma, migraines and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In addition, his drug abuse had led to falls, head trauma, and overdoses that most likely had damaged his brain.|$|E
