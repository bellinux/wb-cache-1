5|$|Six {{species of}} honeyeater have been {{observed}} feeding at its flowers, as have insects including honeybees, ants, butterflies, beetles and native bees. Both birds and insects function as pollinators, but honeybees <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> very effective: in one study only about 4% of honeybees collected pollen, and they tended to move from inflorescence to inflorescence on the same plant, rather than moving between plants.|$|E
5|$|Many {{mammalian}} serpins {{have been}} identified that share no obvious orthology with a human serpin counterpart. Examples include numerous rodent serpins (particularly some of the murine intracellular serpins) {{as well as the}} uterine serpins. The term uterine serpin refers to members of the serpin A clade that are encoded by the SERPINA14 gene. Uterine serpins are produced by the endometrium of a restricted group of mammals in the Laurasiatheria clade under the influence of progesterone or estrogen. They <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> functional proteinase inhibitors and may function during pregnancy to inhibit maternal immune responses against the conceptus or to participate in transplacental transport.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, unusual environments may {{preserve}} soft tissues. These lagerstätten allow paleontologists {{to examine}} the internal anatomy of animals that in other sediments are represented only by shells, spines, claws, etc. – if they are preserved at all. However, even lagerstätten present an incomplete picture of life at the time. The majority of organisms living at the time <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> represented because lagerstätten are restricted to a narrow range of environments, e.g. where soft-bodied organisms can be preserved very quickly by events such as mudslides; and the exceptional events that cause quick burial {{make it difficult to}} study the normal environments of the animals. The sparseness of the fossil record means that organisms are expected to exist long before and after they are found in the fossil record– this is known as the Signor-Lipps effect.|$|E

25|$|NET is a {{very weak}} {{inhibitor}} of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (IC50 = 46μM and 51μM, respectively), but these actions require very high concentrations of NET that are far above therapeutic circulating levels (which are in the nanomolar range) and hence <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> clinically relevant.|$|E

25|$|Butterflyfish {{look like}} smaller {{versions}} of angelfish (Pomacanthidae), but unlike these, lack preopercle spines at the gill covers. Some {{members of the}} genus Heniochus resemble the Moorish idol (Zanclus cornutus) of the monotypic Zanclidae. Among the paraphyletic Perciformes, the former <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> too distantly related to butterflyfish, whereas the Zanclidae seem far less close.|$|E
25|$|Bruckner was {{a renowned}} organist at the St Florian's Priory, where he improvised frequently. Those improvisations were usually not transcribed, {{so that only}} a few of his work for organ has survived. The five Preludes in E-flat major (1836–1837), {{classified}} WAB 127 and WAB 128, as well as a few other WAB-unclassified works, which have been found in Bruckner's Präludienbuch, <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> by Bruckner.|$|E

25|$|Eggs {{are laid}} in June and July, in {{clutches}} of 40–65 eggs. The {{size of the}} egg is 5.5–6.5mm or 8.6 × 7.2mm. Juveniles hatch after three to four weeks, and may consume their siblings under unfavourable climate conditions. Maturity is reached after two to five years. The life span is up to 20 years. Ten-year-old individuals <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> uncommon in natural populations. The maximum lifespan is 35 years.|$|E
25|$|No studies examine topical {{salicylic}} acid in pregnancy. Oral {{salicylic acid}} is {{not associated with}} an increase in malformations if used during the first trimester, but in late pregnancy has been associated with bleeding, especially intracranial bleeding. The risks of aspirin late in pregnancy <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> relevant for a topical exposure to salicylic acid, even late in the pregnancy, because of its low systemic levels. Topical salicylic acid is common in many over-the-counter dermatological agents and the lack of adverse reports suggests a low teratogenic potential.|$|E
25|$|Monongahela-style stemmed stone pipes {{have been}} found among a few {{southeast}} Fort Ancient sites, including Orchard and Man, and Mount Carbon, although {{there appears to be}} no Monongahelan Monyock Cord-impressed ceramic pipes at Fort Ancient sites. Shell-tempered pipes <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> Iroquoian, as found at the Clover site and one of the two fragments from the Buffalo site. A pipe found at the Hardin site near the Big Sandy has an etching of a lizard. These sites are in the southwest part of the state.|$|E

25|$|Attack {{trees are}} related to the {{established}} fault tree formalism. Fault tree methodology employs boolean expressions to gate conditions when parent nodes are satisfied by leaf nodes. By including a priori probabilities with each node, it is possible to perform calculate probabilities with higher nodes using Bayes Rule. However, in reality accurate probability estimates are either unavailable or too expensive to gather. With respect to computer security with active participants (i.e., attackers), the probability distribution of events <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> independent nor uniformly distributed, hence, naive Bayesian analysis is unsuitable.|$|E
25|$|Pieces {{which take}} {{multiple}} steps per move <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> allowed to promote by crossing into the promotion zone and back out again: {{this is not}} explicitly stated in the rules, and chu shogi does not offer guidance here because such pieces do not promote in chu shogi, but it would contravene the usual stipulation that the move start outside and end inside the promotion zone. Another small piece of evidence is that the fire demon's burn is only calculated {{at the end of}} a turn, like promotion, and it does not apply to intermediate steps in the move. For similar reasons, igui or capturing probably does not allow promotion if the move begins and ends outside the promotion zone, even if it passes in and back out along the way.|$|E
