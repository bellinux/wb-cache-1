500|$|Marcie Bianco of Quartz {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "centered around women's desire" [...] and Haynes structured {{it in a way}} that [...] "elevates the power of women's gaze". The omission of Carol from Best Picture, Bianco concluded, illustrates [...] "yet <b>again</b> <b>how</b> sexism operates in the world, and in the Academy specifically, as the refusal to see women as protagonists and agents of desire." [...] Writing for Paper magazine, Carey O'Donnell observed that gay romances are only [...] "Oscar surefires" [...] when they use the tragedy and desolation equation, and [...] "a depiction of two strong women in love with each other ... who end up being [...] " [...] with their lesbian relationship [...] "seems to still be troubling to many." [...] David Ehrlich of Rolling Stone commented that the film's [...] "patience and precision" [...] did not conform to Academy tastes, but its legacy [...] "will doubtlessly survive this year's most egregious snub".|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{noted the}} use of Auto-Tune in Spears' voice. Ewing said that Blackout serves as a {{reminder}} of how instantly recognizable Spears' vocals are, saying that [...] "treated or untreated: her thin Southern huskiness is one of the defining sounds of 00s pop." [...] He noted that the album [...] "is a masterclass in autotune and vocal treatment as a studio instrument, disrupting and jamming the songs as much as it helps them." [...] While reviewing Spears' demo of [...] "Telephone", Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone compared it to [...] "Piece of Me", [...] "proving yet <b>again</b> <b>how</b> much impact Britney has had on the sonics of current pop. People love to make fun of Britney, and why not, but if 'Telephone' proves anything, it's that Blackout may be the most influential pop album of the past five years." [...] In June 2012, [...] "Blackout" [...] was added to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's musical library and archive.|$|E
500|$|Writing for AOL TV, Michael Sciannamea thought [...] "The Convict" [...] seemed {{different}} from previous episodes, citing as evidence {{the scene of}} Michael and Martin discussing trustworthy black men; Sciannamea attributed this to its guest writers: [...] "I don't think Gervais and Merchant went over the top...it just seemed {{a little different than}} the others." [...] Also in his review, Sciannamea expressed his gradual enjoyment of Andy, [...] "When I first saw him up in Stamford, I thought he was just the Connecticut version of Dwight. But now I think he adds greatly to the mix and is definitely one who is going to stir things up in Scranton." [...] Give Me My Remote's Kath Skerry believed [...] "the uncomfortable, unbearably awkward moments that the UK version perfected are definitely present throughout the episode."

500|$|For {{the next}} several years Heyer {{published}} one romance novel and one thriller each year. The romances were far more popular: they usually sold 115,000copies, while her thrillers sold 16,000copies. According to her son, Heyer [...] "regarded the writing of mystery stories rather as we would regard tackling a crossword puzzle – an intellectual diversion before the harder tasks of life have to be faced". Heyer's husband was involved in much of her writing. He often read the proofs of her historical romances to catch any errors that she might have missed, and served as a collaborator for her thrillers. He provided the plots of the detective stories, describing the actions of characters [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B". Heyer would then create the characters and the relationships between them and bring the plot points to life. She found it difficult at times to rely on someone else's plots; on at least one occasion, before writing the last chapter of a book, she asked Rougier to explain once <b>again</b> <b>how</b> the murder was really committed.|$|E

2500|$|In the UK, an {{editorial}} in The Times asked, [...] "Why ... do Americans continue to tolerate gun laws and a culture that seems to condemn thousands of innocents to death every year, when presumably, tougher restrictions, {{such as those in}} force in European countries, could at least reduce the number?" [...] An article on the front-page of the Ottawa Citizen, advocating tougher gun control laws, [...] similarly asked why America tolerated laws which [...] "allowed thousands of innocents to be killed each year." [...] The Swedish paper Göteborgs-Posten commented that [...] "without access to weapons, the killings at Virginia Tech might have been prevented" [...] because [...] "the fundamental reason is often the perpetrator's psychological problems in combination with access to weapons." [...] In Japan, the Asahi Shimbun commented that [...] "the mass shooting.... reminded us once <b>again</b> <b>how</b> disturbingly common gun fatalities are in the United States," [...] and went on to note, [...] "Humans become enraged and desperate, and a gun {{in the hands of an}} enraged or desperate individual could be a sure recipe of disaster or tragedy."

2500|$|The EMMS {{began its}} mission to Malawi {{with the passage}} of one of its students, Neil MacVicar, to set up the Blantyre Mission in 1895. [...] MacVicar had grown up poor and subsisted in his studies through 5 shillings of {{unheated}} lodgings and five shillings a week for food. [...] Despite this great adversity, he graduated in 1893 as the top student at Edinburgh University, having received numerous medals. [...] In 1896, at the urging of the EMMS, he oversaw the construction of a brick building that served as the dispensary at Blantyre, Malawi. [...] He was charged with the responsibility to [...] "‘serve the mission and the natives first, the European community only next.’" [...] Once there, he began training Africans as assistants. [...] In so doing, he was the first European to provide such training in the region. [...] To supplement this training, he published a set of lectures that would enable an African assistant to carry out simple medical procedures, such as dressing wounds, without observation. [...] MacVicar and the doctors who followed him expressed their indebtedness to the nurses and assistants. [...] In fact, MacVicar wrote, [...] "‘Perhaps the greatest practical development of the Victorian era, the development of modern nursing, without which neither surgery nor medicine could have achieved half their triumphs.’" [...] Later, the Blantyre missionary wrote, [...] "We notice over and over <b>again</b> <b>how</b> much more readily [...] will submit to take choloroform, for instance, if administered by one of the boys , and they too can coax patients when all our efforts are of no avail." [...] Nevertheless, these African assistants were not treated with the same respect as Europeans. [...] MacVicar acknowledged that [...] "In a civilized country it would be a grave error to encourage men to practice Medicine and Surgery in a fractional kind of way," [...] but that with such a limited number of doctors, it would be justified in an [...] "uncivilized" [...] country.|$|E
2500|$|The {{project was}} {{supported}} by Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fisher and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Governor Fisher was an old friend and ally of McCreight, and together they labored for many years on the Cook Forest conservation project. [...] Both were “farm-boy” bankers who grew up near the Great Shamokin Path of the Seneca, knew the forests and believed in conservation. It was not until Fisher was elected Governor that the Cook Forest Bill was finally passed and signed on April 14, 1927. Governor Fisher supported McCreight’s proposal. “The Governor has written me that he is greatly interested {{in the use of}} the park for the home of the native Red Folks, and I think the plan can be worked out. [...] My suggestion is that Good Face, and with William Spotted Tail with his family, and John Sitting Bull, and others who would suit with my old friend Flying Hawk who lives at Rockyford.” McCreight, forever the dedicated public educator, saw yet another opportunity for [...] "Young America". “The Eastern people, especially the younger generation, are greatly interested in the Indians and to have a few of the old time names of whom they have read in history, it would add to their desire to know more of them. [...] Anyway, the American People owe the Indians a lot and there is nothing that I know of that would be finer, than to make a nice home for them in this great natural forest where they once lived and which was theirs before the whites came and it is the one piece of land that is just the same as it was when the original red men lived there. [...] Like all parks in the north, it would not be necessary for them to remain in it in the winter, likely they could go back and forth as it appealed to them. [...] Of course there are plenty of Indians that would be glad to get the chance to come, but not all are desired by any means. [...] I know Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke and will of course consult with him if the plan seems to be practical in other ways. [...] I would like, first to know whether the plan would appeal to the Indians themselves, the ones I have in mind to have for it. [...] Possibly you could see Spotted Tail too. [...] Good Face has been here before. [...] He told me he was at my house nearly thirty years ago. [...] Now that you understand what I have in mind, there are others who might be just as desirable to those mentioned, in your country, and I wish you would think about it and write me <b>again</b> <b>how</b> you regard it, and with any suggestions you might have considering the plan.” In February 1929, the Superintendent of the Pine Ridge Agency, Indian Field Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior contacted McCreight that “two families have signified their willingness to go if proper arrangements can be made and a contract and bond furnished.” [...] McCreight’s vision of Lakota living and working at Cook Forest was endorsed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and families were ready to move to the great forest along the Clarion River. However, when the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, with the onset of the Great Depression, the Lakota project at Cook Forest was shelved.|$|E
