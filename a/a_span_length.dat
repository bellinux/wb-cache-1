50|$|A short {{distance}} beyond the junction, the branch line spanned Loch Etive {{by means of}} Connel Bridge, a cantilever bridge with <b>a</b> <b>span</b> <b>length</b> {{that was at the}} time second only to the Forth Bridge. In 1940, additional sidings were laid in {{on the south side of}} the station for the wartime traffic, these being removed in 1948. Prior to closure of the Ballachulish branch 1966 both trains and vehicles crossed the bridge. The extensive track layout was reduced to just a single line routed via the former Branch Platform (the original Up platform). The island platform was taken out of use. The layout grew again in 1968 when an oil storage depot with two sidings was built on the site of the goods yard. A run-round loop was laid alongside the single line to the east of the station, connected at each end by points controlled from a ground frame.|$|E

50|$|The {{bridge is}} 21 ft long, has <b>a</b> <b>span</b> <b>length</b> of 18 ft, and a width of 40.4 ft. It {{is faced with}} Platteville limestone. The area was {{originally}} part of the George W. Baird farm, but in the 1920s, much of the farmstead was sold off for development. In 1922 the Edina Country Club housing subdivision was platted, {{just north of the}} bridge and north of 50th Street. The Edina Country Club, west of the bridge, was opened in 1923, and other portions of Edina were being developed as well. As traffic increased, the original steel beam bridge was no longer sufficient to accommodate all the vehicles, so the city of Edina sought a replacement in 1937. On March 8, 1937, the Edina City Council accepted the proposal by Lyle Culvert & Pipe Company to build an Armco multi-plate arch bridge. The facing was proposed to be irregularly coursed boulder stone, designed in the rustic style. Construction began in May 1937, but in July 1937, the design of the stone facing was changed from boulder stone to limestone. This was done to harmonize with the limestone veneer on the nearby St. Stephen's Episcopal Church. The construction schedule {{did not appear to be}} set back. Construction was largely complete in August 1937, and a city newsletter published in September 1937 shows the completed bridge.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of different <b>span</b> <b>lengths,</b> material type, and storage conditions on the flexural properties of orthodontic FRC and stainless steel twisted retainers. Two different <b>span,</b> <b>lengths</b> of both FRCs and stainless steel retainers (11. 0 mm and 8. 0 mm) were investigated. Six specimens of FRCs (OrthoStick, StickTech, Turku, Finland) and six specimens of multistranded orthodontic wires (Penta One, Masel, Bristol, PA, USA) were prepared for each group. The FRCs were divided into 4 group according to: <b>a)</b> different <b>span</b> <b>length</b> during the three-point bending test; b) different storage modality: dry and wet (distilled water T= 37 °). The three point bending test was proceeded with material testing machine (Lloyd LRX, Fareham, UK). Load-deflection curves were recorded for 1. 0 mm deflection with Nexygen 4. 0 (Lloyd LRX, Fareham, UK). From the load trials carried out on various samples of FRCs and on steel orthodontic wires, it was possible to derive the average curves of their mechanical behavior. Conditions being equal (<b>span</b> <b>length</b> and deflection), the steel wires reach loads decidedly inferior and demonstrate more elasticity compared to the glass fibers. The fibers with <b>a</b> lesser <b>span</b> <b>length</b> support lesser loads but demonstrate more elasticity and therefore are more similar to the steel wires. One difference in the results was also observed in relation to the storage conditions of the fibers (wet or dry). The wet fibers, in fact, reach inferior loads, showing characteristics more similar to steel and demonstrate more elasticity compared to the dry fibers. In all the tests carried out there were never cases of complete fractures, only micro fractures clinically observable as white spots. In conclusions, the results of the present investigation demonstrate that in patients who present aesthetic concerns or allergies to traditional wires, FRCs might represent an advantageous alternative for the orthodontic retainers...|$|R
