Characteristically, {{linear induction motor}}s have a finite primary or secondary length, which generates end-effects, whereas a conventional induction motor is arranged in an endless loop.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For a {{continuous}} feeding of sheet metals in forming press lines mechanical roll and gripper feeders are used. Typical resulting problems are the damage {{of the sheet}} surface due to the mechanical contact. The present contribution deals with the investigations of an electromagnetic material feeder for electric conductive sheet metals. The concept {{is based on the}} principle of an <b>asynchronous</b> <b>linear</b> <b>motor.</b> Here the sheet metal acts directly as the secondary part. The new approach was first analysed and designed by means of finite element simulation. With experimental measurements the simulations could be validated using a demonstrator of the electromagnetic feeder. The results indicate that the feeding forces of partially 1000 N can be doubled in comparison to conventional mechanical roll feeders...|$|E

Assisted launch of civil aircraft {{has the potential}} of reducing the required runway length, reducing noise and emissions near airports and improving overall aircraft efficiency through reducing engine thrust requirements. A comparison is made of practical designs of a linear induction motor, a linear permanent magnet synchronous motor and a superconducting linear synchronous motor to propel the A 320 - 200 aircraft. The machine design requirements are established considering aerodynamic and engine performance and allow the aircraft to safely complete the take-off procedure. Analytical design of conventional synchronous and <b>asynchronous</b> <b>linear</b> <b>motor</b> will be compared with finite element analysis. A superconducting synchronous motor design is also considered, accounting for full system losses including the cryocooler power requirement and the mechanical & design constraints necessary for the cooler and the superconducting coil...|$|E

40|$|Usually, {{transportation}} of laminated products is done through rolls, {{put in rotation}} by electric motors. The acting moving force depends solely on the adherence of the laminated product to the moving rolls, which reduces {{the speed of the}} latter. The drawback of this speed limitation is most noticeable on the portions of the steel mill where, according to the work conditions, each metal sheet is to be rapidly stopped or pushed away (cutting zone, etc…). Since a large acceleration is not possible due to the resulting high inertial forces, a sliding of the bars on the rolls will occur. A solution to this problem may be obtained by using a <b>linear</b> <b>asynchronous</b> <b>motor</b> whose moving body would be the laminated produc...|$|R

Generally the Joule heat loss associated with copper lead is considered as the main loss in motors while the iron loss is ignored at a lower frequency operation, not only because it’s regarded as small enough but also it’s difficult to measure or calculate. This paper introduces an experimental method to measure the iron loss for <b>linear</b> <b>motors.</b> Two kinds of moving-magnet <b>linear</b> <b>motors</b> have been tested, one is known as single coil and magnet <b>linear</b> <b>motor,</b> and the other as double coils and magnets <b>linear</b> <b>motor.</b> Dependence of iron loss on frequency and displacement are investigated.

30|$|When {{the pole}} number of a <b>linear</b> <b>motor</b> is {{not less than}} six, the values of negative-sequence current and zero-sequence current are much small {{compared}} with the positive sequence current; thus their influence on the cascaded <b>linear</b> <b>motor</b> can be ignored [5, 6].
