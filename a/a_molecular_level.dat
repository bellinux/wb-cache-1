Nanometer-sized carbonaceous molecules anchored on graphene provide ideal systems for monitoring rotational motions via ACTEM. We observed the preferential registry of longer molecular axis along graphene zigzag or armchair lattice directions due to the stacking-dependent molecule-graphene energy landscape. The calculated cross section from elastic scattering theory was used to experimentally estimate the rotational energy barriers of molecules on graphene. The observed energy barrier was {{within the range of}} 1. 5 &# 8211; 12 meV per atom, which is in good agreement with previous calculation results.

Here we report <b>a</b> first <b>molecular</b> <b>level</b> model of <b>an</b> entire overlap region of a C-terminal cross-linked type I collagen assembly and carry out a nanomechanical characterization based on large-scale molecular dynamics simulation in explicit water solvent. Our {{results show that the}} deformation mechanism and strength of the structure are greatly affected by the presence of the cross-link, and by the specific loading condition of how the stretching is applied. We find that the presence of a cross-link results in greater strength during deformation as complete intermolecular slip is prevented, and thereby particularly affects larger deformation levels. Conversely, the lack of a cross-link results in the onset of intermolecular sliding during deformation and as a result an overall weaker structure is obtained. Through a detailed analysis of the distribution of deformation by calculating the molecular strain we show that the location of largest strains does not occur around the covalent bonding region, but is found in regions further away from this location.

One of the earliest applications of ancestral reconstruction, to predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein through residue contacts, was published by Shindyalov and colleagues. Phylogenies relating 67 different protein families were generated by a distance-based clustering method (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean, UPGMA), and ancestral sequences were reconstructed by parsimony.
