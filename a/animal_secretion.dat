We show that XA 21 is glycosylated and is primarily localized to the ER and also to the plasma membrane (PM). In BiP 3 -overexpressing rice plants, XA 21 -mediated immunity is compromised, XA 21 stability is significantly decreased, and XA 21 proteolytic cleavage is inhibited.

Also, in contrast to specialist pathogens such as Plasmodium or Trypanosoma, the pathogens that Chloropidae transmit are not adapted to particular vectors. However, some Chloropidae are troublesome in that they act as purely mechanical agents of disease transmission. Species that occur in large numbers and are attracted to <b>animal</b> <b>secretions</b> such as tears and dung, sometimes cause serious irritation and infection. Prominent examples include the eye gnat genera: Liohippelates in the Americas and Siphunculina in parts of Asia.

In warm seasons they may emerge in huge numbers and swarm about the eyes, up the nostrils and in the mouths of mammals, including livestock and humans. The irritation can be so great as to compel the use of gauze face masks for humans and even for animals. Furthermore, the flies are so small that the gauze must be very fine to offer effective protection.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMany infaunal marine {{invertebrates}} produce mucous excretions, composed primarily of the glycoprotein mucin, that play {{important roles in}} burrow stabilization. As with other biopolymers, the ionization of mucin provides highly reactive organic ligands that enable the sorption of metal cations from seawater. Owing to the difficulties in its isolation, however, the specific role of mucin in the adsorptive properties of <b>animal</b> <b>secretions</b> in marine environments is poorly understood. Here we apply a surface complexation approach to model proton and Cd adsorption behavior of partially purified Type III porcine gastric mucin (PGM), a commercially available analog to natural infaunal mucus. FTIR, proton and cadmium adsorption experiments indicate that Type III PGM mimics the acid-base and metal complexation behavior of natural mucous gels excreted by terebellid polychaete worms. At marine pH, {{nearly two-thirds of the}} total ligands in mucin-type glycoproteins are deprotonated and thus available to participate in metal cation adsorption reactions. Importantly, the concentration of available organic ligands in mucin exceeds (by up to 5 times) that of a variety of other metal-reactive organic compounds comprising the organic fraction of marine sediments. A substantial fraction of the dissolved organic matter in the bioturbated zone of marine sediments occurs in the form of mucin-associated glycoproteins; the availability of such organic materials may strongly influence the distribution of cations at the burrow margin...|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} raised {{awareness of}} the threat of a new influenza pandemic has stimulated interest in the detection of influenza A viruses in human as well as <b>animal</b> <b>secretions.</b> Virus isolation alone is unsatisfactory for this purpose because of its inherent limited sensitivity and the lack of host cells that are universally permissive to all influenza A viruses. Previously described PCR methods are more sensitive but are targeted predominantly at virus strains currently circulating in humans, since the sequences of the primer sets display considerable numbers of mismatches to the sequences of animal influenza A viruses. Therefore, a new set of primers, based on highly conserved regions of the matrix gene, was designed for single-tube reverse transcrip-tion-PCR for the detection of influenza A viruses from multiple species. This PCR proved to be fully reactive with a panel of 25 genetically diverse virus isolates that were obtained from birds, humans, pigs, horses, and seals and that included all known subtypes of influenza A virus. It was not reactive with the 11 other RNA viruses tested. Comparative tests with throat swab samples from humans and fecal and cloacal swab samples from birds confirmed that the new PCR is faster and up to 100 -fold more sensitive than classical virus isolation procedures.

40|$|Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a {{zoonotic}} disease that affects domestic ruminants, particularly sheep, cattle and goats. In livestock and humans, RVF is spread through bites from infected aedes and culex mosquitoes.

In Kenya, RVF outbreaks have occurred ten {{times with the}} first recorded in 1931 and the last in 2006. During the 2006 - 2007 outbreak, RVF occurred in Baringo County for the first time. The outbreak was associated with El Nino/Southern Oscillations related climatic anomalies. Through an on-going study on community adaptation to Malaria and RVF, which specifically focuses on how culture influences disease, data on socio-cultural practices in livestock production has been collected through focus group discussions and key informant interviews among the Tugen and Ilchamus communities of Baringo County. Preliminary findings show that both communities largely depend on livestock for their livelihoods. In terms of risk of exposure to RVF, both communities exhibit vulnerability based on their low level of awareness of the disease; consumption of meat from animals that die of diseases and unknown causes; disposal of dead animals; close contact with both healthy and sickly livestock; and management of human febrile illnesses. The study concludes that both communities are vulnerable to RVF and recommends that they should receive targeted awareness creation messages on the occurrence, transmission and prevention of RVF in order to decrease vulnerability to human and livestock infections...|$|R
40|$|In nature adult insects, such as {{parasitic}} wasps or ‘parasitoids’ often {{depend on}} supplemental nutritional sources, such as sugars and other carbohydrates, {{to maximize their}} life-expectancy and reproductive potential. These food resources are commonly obtained from <b>animal</b> <b>secretions</b> or plant exudates, including honeydew, fruit juices and both floral and extra-floral nectar. In addition to exogenous sources of nutrition, adult parasitoids obtain endogenous sources from their hosts through ‘host-feeding’ behavior, whereby blood is imbibed from the host. Resources obtained from the host contain lipids, proteins and sugars that are assumed to enhance longevity and/or fecundity. Here we conducted an experiment exploring the effects of naturally occurring sugars on longevity and fecundity in the solitary hyperparasitoids, Lysibia nana and Gelis agilis. Although both species are closely related, L. nana does not host-feed whereas G. agilis does. In a separate experiment, we compared reproduction and longevity in G. agilis reared on either honey, a honey-sugar ‘mimic’, and glucose. Reproductive success and longevity in both hyperparasitoids varied significantly when fed on different sugars. However, only mannose- and water-fed wasps performed significantly more poorly than wasps fed on four other sugar types. G. agilis females fed honey produced twice as many progeny as those reared on the honey-sugar mimic or on glucose, whereas female longevity was only reduced on the mimic mixture. This result shows not only that host feeding influences reproductive success in G. agilis, but also that non-sugar constituents in honey do. The importance of non-sugar nutrients in honey on parasitoid reproduction is discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Modulation of the {{secretion}} {{of potassium}} by accompanying anions in humans.

In humans, results are inconclusive as previous studies have not differentiated between a kaliuresis due to a rise in the concentration of K from one due to an increase in the volume of urine. Our purpose was to study the effects of chloride (Cl) and bicarbonate on the secretion of K in the CCD in humans using the transtubular K concentration gradient (TTKG), a semi-quantitative index of secretion of K in the terminal CCD. After control blood and urine samples were obtained, all subjects ingested 0. 2 mg fludrocortisone to ensure that mineralocorticoids were not limiting the secretion of K. The anionic composition of the urine was varied using three protocols: Normal subjects (N = 11) ingested cystine and methionine to induce sulfaturia; nine subjects with a contracted ECF volume (to lower the concentration of Cl in the urine) were also studied during sulfaturia following the ingestion of cystine and methionine; 13 normovolemic subjects were studied during bicarbonaturia following the ingestion of acetazolamide. When the concentration of Cl in the urine was > 15 mmol/liter, sulfate had no effect on the TTKG. With lower concentrations of Cl in the urine, the TTKG rose 1. 5 -fold. The TTKG rose 1. 8 -fold in the presence of bicarbonaturia despite concentrations of Cl in the urine that were > 15 mmol/liter, suggesting that bicarbonate has additional effects on this K secretory process. At comparable concentrations of sulfate and bicarbonate in the urine, the TTKG was increased only with bicarbonaturia. We conclude {{that it is important to}} control for the effects of the accompanying anions when evaluating the role of the kidney in disorders of K homeostasis...|$|R

There is a mystery regarding its origin because the caboclos maintain that this substance is derived only from <b>animal</b> <b>secretions</b> (from a frog called canuaru), whereas the historic literature claims that ‘resin-of-canuaru’ is derived solely from a plant exudate (resin). Based on our ethnographic studies, we hypothesized that this substance {{is a combination of}} both. Because the past reports on this resiniferous material in the literature are based solely on observations, we aimed to present ethnographic, zoological and chemical data to try to elucidate the origin of the ‘resin-of-canuaru’. Materials and methodsEthnographic techniques and methods were applied, including participant observation, the use of field diaries and informal and unstructured interviews. The canuaru frog (Trachycephalus resinifictrix Goeldi, 1907) and ‘resin-of-canuaru’ were collected for taxonomic identification and chemical analysis, respectively. The resiniferous ‘resin-of-canuaru’ was extracted using MeOH and then analyzed by silica gel TLC and NMR. ResultsCanuaru frogs live in tree cavities and secrete a large amount of substances during spawning, resulting in a resiniferous material. NMR analysis of the MeOH extract of this crude material showed peaks assigned to 3, 4 -secofriedel- 4 (23) -en- 3 -oic acid (putranjuvic acid) and its methyl ester derivative (methyl putranjivate) and to biogenetic precursor of these two compounds (a lactone derivative), which is formed by the oxidation of friedelin. Based on evidence that Protium species accumulate primarily tetracyclic/pentacyclic triterpenoids and that the co-occurrence of the compounds listed above is rarely described in plant species, we suggest that these compounds could be products of the biotransformation of friedelin by the frog.

40|$|SUMMARY It is {{currently}} {{believed that the}} rate and direction of sodium transport in the small intestine may be regulated by the activity of Na,K-ATPase in the basolateral cell membrane. We tested this hypothesis by selectively infusing ouabain, a known inhibitor of Na,K-ATPase, into the mesenteric artery supplying a perfused loop of ileum in 18 dogs. Before ouabain infusion there were significant correlations between the activity of Na,K-ATPase and net and lumen to plasma fluxes of sodium and chloride. After ouabain, {{there was no significant}} change in sodium and chloride trans-port, unidirectional fluxes or transmucosal potential difference, despite a 50 % reduction in Na,K-ATPase activity. Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between Na,K-ATPase activity and sodium or chloride transport after ouabain. The only statistically significant effect of ouabain infusion was a reduction in the rate of bicarbonate secretion. Thus, the results of our experiments suggest that mucosal Na,K-ATPase is not a rate-limiting step in the absorption of sodium and chloride in the dog ileum, though it may be an important facilitative factor. The normal small intestine in vivo usually absorbs physiological electrolyte solutions, although the rate of absorption is highly variable from subject to subject, and in the same subject on different days (Turnberg et al., 1970). In some apparently normal people and animals, the small intestine even secretes fluid, rather than absorbs it (Florey et al., 1941; Scott, 1965; Turnberg etal., 1970). In some <b>animals,</b> <b>secretion</b> is more common than absorption (Powell et al., 1968). One of the plausible explanations of variable rates of absorption-secretion is the activity of the baso-lateral membrane concentration of sodium and potassium-dependent ATPase (Na,K-ATPase) (Schultz et al., 1974). This enzyme {{is believed to be the}} biochemical counterpart of a sodium pump, which transports sodium in exchange for potassium across the basolateral membrane (Hokin, 1976).

Intercellular transfer of homeoprotein was observed ex vivo between animal cells and in vivo in higher plants.

This mutation decreases nuclear addressing, and its effect on nuclear import and intercellular transfer is reverted by the addition of an ectopic nuclear localization signal. We propose that, despite evolutionary distance and the differences in multicellular organization, similar mechanisms are at work for intercellular transfer of homeoprotein in plants and animals.

40|$|Oral {{candidiasis}} is {{a common}} fungal infection in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although rare {{at the time of}} primary HIV infection, it is frequently found throughout the asymptomatic phase and is predictive of progressive immunodeficiency. However, the precise immune defect which results in outgrowth of commensal Candida albicans in HIV infection has not been identified. Mice infected with the Du 5 H(G 6 T 2) mixture of mouse leukemia viruses develop a syndrome, designated murine AIDS (MAIDS), that has many of the immune abnormalities found in HIV infection. Retrovirus-infected C 57 BL/ 6 mice were examined for their ability to resist the development of oral candidiasis from the carrier state established after a self-limiting acute infection and to clear a subsequent secondary inoculum of oral C. albicans. Most of the mice orally colonized with C. albicans and then inoculated with the retrovirus mixture maintained a low-level oral carriage of C. albicans, while 30 % of coinfected mice developed recurring 2 - to 3 -week episodes of acute Candida proliferation, separated by transient recoveries to the carrier state. The frequencies of CD 4 + and CD 8 + lymphocytes were, respectively, unchanged and significantly decreased (P < 0. 05) in both cervical lymph nodes and spleens of coinfected mice compared to the corresponding frequencies in C. albicans-carrying, virus-free, age-matched control <b>animals.</b> <b>Secretion</b> of gamma interferon by concanavalin A (ConA) -stimulated spleen cells from Candida-carrying, retrovirus-infected mice was significantly decreased (P < 0. 05) compared to that of C. albicans-carrying, retrovirus-free mice, in accordance with known abnormalities associated with MAIDS. However, production of this cytokine by ConA-stimulated or unstimulated cervical lymph node cells from coinfected mice was enhanced compared to that of virus-free animals colonized with C. albicans. Acquired resistance to reinfection with C. albicans was maintained in retrovirus-infected mice and was associated with a mucosal recruitment of CD 8 + cells not observed in control mice. These results suggest that alterations in mucosal immunity which occur in MAIDS differ substantially from defects observed at other sites and that surrogate epithelial defense mechanisms may function locally to limit Candida proliferation...|$|R

Accordingly, in the oprF mutant, production of the signal molecules N-(3 -oxododecanoyl) -l-homoserine lactone and N-butanoyl-l-homoserine lactone {{was found to be}} reduced and delayed, respectively. Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) production was decreased, while its precursor, 4 -hydroxy- 2 -heptylquinoline (HHQ), accumulated in the cells. Taken together, these results show the involvement of OprF in P. aeruginosa virulence, at least partly through modulation of the quorum-sensing network. This is the first study showing a link between OprF, PQS synthesis, T 3 SS, and virulence factor production, providing novel insights into virulence expression...|$|R
40|$|Animals {{communicating}} via scent often deposit composite {{signals that}} incorporate odorants from multiple sources; however, {{the function of}} mixing chemical signals remains understudied. We tested both a 'multiple-messages' and a 'fixative' hypothesis of composite olfactory signalling, which, respectively, posit that mixing scents functions to increase information content or prolong signal longevity. Our subjects-adult, male ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) -have a complex scent-marking repertoire, involving volatile antebrachial (A) secretions, deposited pure or after being mixed with a squalene-rich paste exuded from brachial (B) glands. Using behavioural bioassays, we examined recipient responses to odorants collected from conspecific strangers. We concurrently presented pure A, pure B and mixed A[*]+[*]B secretions, in fresh or decayed conditions. Lemurs preferentially responded to mixed over pure secretions, their interest increasing and shifting over time, from sniffing and countermarking fresh mixtures, to licking and countermarking decayed mixtures. Substituting synthetic squalene (S) -a well-known fixative-for B secretions did not replicate prior results: B secretions, which contain additional chemicals that probably encode salient information, were preferred over pure S. Whereas support for the 'multiple-messages' hypothesis underscores the unique contribution from each of an <b>animal's</b> various <b>secretions,</b> support for the 'fixative' hypothesis highlights the synergistic benefits of composite signals...|$|R
