25|$|Over time, the {{structure}} of the Indonesian economy has changed considerably. Historically, the economy has been heavily weighted towards the agricultural sector, reflecting both its stage of economic development and government policies in the 1950s and 1960s to promote <b>agricultural</b> <b>self-sufficiency.</b> A gradual process of industrialisation and urbanisation began in the late 1960s, and accelerated in the 1980s as falling oil prices saw the government focus on diversifying away from oil exports and towards manufactured exports. This development continued throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s despite the oil counter-shocks. During these periods, gross domestic product ("GDP") rose at an average rate of 7.1%. Indonesia saw consistent growth, with the official poverty rate falling from 60% to 15%. From the mid 1980s, trade barriers were reduced and the Indonesian economy became more globally integrated. The 1997 Asian financial crisis affected Indonesia both economically and politically. The government's initial response was to float the rupiah, raise key domestic interest rates, and tighten fiscal policy. The effects of the crisis were severe. By November 1997, rapid currency depreciation had caused public debt to reach US$60 bn, imposing severe strains on the government's budget. In 1998, real GDP contracted by 13.1%. The economy reached its low point in mid-1999 and real GDP growth for the year was 0.8%. Inflation reached 72% in 1998 but slowed to 2% in 1999.|$|E

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} is meeting the expectations and necessities {{of the current}} era and future generations without making any sacrifices. The focus of the sustainable development concept is humankind. Humankind has the responsibility of protecting the environment it lives in, {{as much as it}} has the right to continue living a healthy productive life in harmony with nature. These responsibilities will be the main elements in determining continuity. With these aspects in mind, the research deals with the basic criteria predicted by Meadows on sustainable development. These criteria are divided into three: 'sustainable', 'critical' and 'destructive'. The first element evaluated in these predicted criteria is the increase in population. From the pace of the population increase observed in Turkey, {{it can be said that}} Turkey affects the sustainable development in a 'destructive' way. Other criteria, such as economic development, deforestation rate, the area of the forests and the density of the population show an inclination towards the 'critical area'.

40|$|South Korea is {{a highly}} {{urbanized}} and industrialized country. Increased urbanization and greater specialization have led to rising incomes, and changes in food production and consumption patterns. Changes in consumption and increased production specialization have also resulted in changes in trading patterns, with South Korea emerging as a leading importer of agri-food products. South Korea places great importance on self-sufficiency in food staples, and achieving income parity between rural and urban households. To attain these goals, considerable support has been provided to its agriculture sector. South Korea's policy support to the agriculture sector ranks among the worlds' highest. Small holdings still persist, entry into the sector is difficult, and the farm population is aging rapidly. Demographics and resource scarcity are therefore likely to shape the sector's evolution in the coming decades.

40|$|Agriculture is the {{backbone}} of Nigeria’s socioeconomic development. This paper investigates the impact of agricultural exports on economic growth in Nigeria using OLS regression, Granger causality, Impulse Response Function and Variance Decomposition approaches. Both the OLS regression and Granger causality results {{support the hypothesis that}} agricultural exports- led economic growth in Nigeria. The results, however, show an inverse relationship between the agricultural degree of openness and economic growth in the country. Impulse Response Function results fluctuate and reveal an upward and downward shocks from agricultural export to economic growth in the country. The Variance Decomposition results also show that a shock to agricultural exports can contribute to the fluctuation in the variance of economic growth in the long run. For Nigeria to experience a favourable trade balance in agricultural trade, domestic processing industries should be encouraged while imports of agricultural commodities that the country could process cheaply should be discouraged. Undoubtedly, this measure could drastically reduce the country’s overreliance on food imports and increase the rate of <b>agricultural</b> production for <b>self-sufficiency,</b> exports and its contribution to the economic growth in the country...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{some critics}} and {{proponents of the}} World Trade Organization have noted that export subsidies, by driving down the price of commodities, can provide cheap food for {{consumers}} in developing countries, low prices are harmful to farmers not receiving the subsidy. Because it is usually wealthy countries that can afford domestic subsidies, critics argue that they promote poverty in developing countries by artificially driving down world crop prices. Generally, developing countries have a comparative advantage in producing agricultural goods, but low crop prices encourage developing countries to be dependent buyers of food from wealthy countries. So local farmers, instead of improving the <b>agricultural</b> and economic <b>self-sufficiency</b> of their home country, are {{forced out of the}} market and perhaps even off their land. This occurs {{as a result of a}} process known as [...] "international dumping" [...] in which subsidized farmers are able to [...] "dump" [...] low-cost agricultural goods on foreign markets at costs that un-subsidized farmers cannot compete with. Agricultural subsidies often are a common stumbling block in trade negotiations. In 2006, talks at the Doha round of WTO trade negotiations stalled because the US refused to cut subsidies to a level where other countries' non-subsidized exports would have been competitive.|$|R
40|$|The geo-political {{economy of}} oil {{exporting}} {{countries in the}} Middle East and North Africa are mainly affected by abundant oil resources, semi-arid climate, and rapidly growing population. The interplay of <b>agricultural</b> policies for <b>self-sufficiency,</b> food imports, and oil prices have shaped the food security situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran. This paper explores the dynamic and causality linkage between external factors (e. g. oil prices) and internal factors (e. g. domestic food production). In particular, the causality relationships among domestic wheat production, wheat imports, and oil prices in Iran for 1964 to 1991 are examined. The results {{show that there is}} a unidirectional "Granger Causality" relation from oil price to wheat imports. This suggests that "past and present" history of oil prices and domestic production of wheat are useful information to improve prediction of wheat imports. But the past history of domestic production of food (wheat) alone cannot improve prediction of food imports. The implications of these results are significant in the context of food availability in Iran. Also, the expected agricultural policy reforms under GATT will further expose Iranian agriculture to instability from its macroeconomy {{as well as from the}} world economy. The findings in this study about the dynamic interaction of external and internal variables with food security might by useful in predicting possible consequences of GATT reform. oil price, food security, food self-sufficiency, GATT, wheat imports...|$|R

40|$|Multi-species {{agroforestry}} has {{for centuries}} been a widely practised land {{use in the}} Pacific islands, including in Fiji and Vanuatu. Various forms of agroforestry are practised, the most widely recognised being mixed-species plantings involving timber, fruit or nut trees intercropped with root crops and other food crops; and silvopastoral systems, such as ‘cattle under coconuts’. During and after colonial times, {{there was a major}} decline in agroforestry practice. Home and village gardens now have a reduced role as a source of food for households in Fiji and Vanuatu. Current trends of urbanisation, cash cropping and heavy reliance on food imports, together with reduced prices for previously major export crops, have made the need to encourage multi-species plantings particularly apparent. A comprehensive literature review reveals that an impressive range of benefits can be attributed to multi-species agroforestry, including: agricultural diversification; genetic conservation; carbon capture; catchment protection and rehabilitation; strengthening of <b>agricultural</b> infrastructure; increased <b>self-sufficiency</b> in timber and fuelwood; reduced need for food imports; poverty reduction; improvement in the nutritional status of people and associated health benefits; improved utilisation of degraded and marginal cropping land; improved wildlife habitat; and landscape amenity.
