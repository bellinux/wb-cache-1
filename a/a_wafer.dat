5|$|The {{volatile}} oil, oleum cubebae, was {{the form}} in which cubeb is most commonly used as a drug, the dose being 5 to 20 minims, which may be suspended in mucilage or given after meals in <b>a</b> <b>wafer.</b> The drug exhibited the typical actions of a volatile oil, but exerted some of these to an exceptional degree. As such, it was liable to cause a cutaneous erythema {{in the course of}} its excretion by the skin, had a marked diuretic action, and was a fairly efficient disinfectant of the urinary passages. Its administration caused the appearance in the urine of a salt of cubebic acid which was precipitated by heat or nitric acid, and was therefore liable to be mistaken for albumin, when these two most common tests for the occurrence of albuminuria were applied.|$|E

25|$|Many ASICs are pad-limited, {{meaning that}} the size of the die is {{constrained}} by the number of wire bond pads, rather than the complexity and number of gates used for the device logic. Eliminating bond pads thus permits a more compact integrated circuit, on a smaller die; this increases the number of dies that may be fabricated on <b>a</b> <b>wafer,</b> and thus reduces the cost per die.|$|E

40|$|Geometric {{characterization}} of 50 mm diameter, 50 µm thick single-crystal Si(1 1 1) wafers has been performed using complementary methods: industry-standard capacitance measurements of warp and total thickness variation (TTV), and a technique we term scanned chromatic confocal profilometry (SCCP). We compare the measurements {{made by the}} two techniques and demonstrate the limitations of capacitance measurements when applied to ultrathin wafers. The two-dimensional SCCP measurements are shown to enhance the description of wafer thickness variations beyond that generated by the standard test method. We discuss a Fourier transform-based analysis and show it to be useful in wafer quality assessment.

25|$|In common {{integrated}} circuits, <b>a</b> <b>wafer</b> of monocrystalline silicon {{serves as}} a mechanical support for the circuits, which are created by doping and insulated from each other by thin layers of silicon oxide, an insulator that is easily produced by exposing the element to oxygen under the proper conditions. Silicon {{has become the most}} popular material for both high power semiconductors and integrated circuits because it can withstand the highest temperatures and greatest electrical activity without suffering avalanche breakdown (an electron avalanche is created when heat produces free electrons and holes, which in turn pass more current, which produces more heat). In addition, the insulating oxide of silicon is not soluble in water, which gives it an advantage over germanium (an element with similar properties which can also be used in semiconductor devices) in certain fabrication techniques.|$|E
