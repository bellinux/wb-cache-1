5000|$|The {{reactor core}} is cylindrical, {{approximately}} 2 ft (0.61 m) high and 15 in in diameter. A 5-in. (12.70-cm)-diameter hole, {{referred to as}} the [...] "flux trap," [...] forms the center of the core. The target is typically loaded with curium-244 and other transplutonium isotopes and is positioned on the reactor vertical axis within the flux trap. The fuel region is composed of two concentric fuel elements. The inner element contains 171 fuel plates, and the outer element contains 369 fuel plates. The fuel plates are curved in the shape of an involute, thus providing a constant coolant channel width. The fuel (93% U235 enriched U3O8-Al cermet pg.22) is non-uniformly distributed along the arc of the involute to minimize the radial peak-to-average power density ratio. A burnable poison (boron-10) is included in the inner fuel element primarily to flatten the radial flux peak providing a longer cycle for each fuel element. The <b>average</b> <b>core</b> lifetime with typical experiment loading is approximately 23 days at 85 MW.|$|E

30|$|The <b>averaged</b> <b>core</b> {{analysis}} {{data from}} the Stenlille wells suggest that the uncertainty range can be expressed by multipliers of 2 and 0.5 (Fig.  9).

As the core permeability data do not follow a normal distribution, the uncertainty cannot be described by conventional standard deviation and instead, we suggest applying this uncertainty envelope. We assume the Stenlille dataset to be relevant for assessing the uncertainty range for a typical Gassum geothermal reservoir at any location in Denmark.|$|R

These {{results showed that}} the <b>average</b> <b>core</b> size increase occurred the most between 100 and 150  °C as we have seen from the heat treatments of gAuNP 3 nm-GO. However, after heating at 150  °C, TEM image and histogram {{results showed that the}} gAuNP 3 nm-tGO had a smaller <b>average</b> <b>core</b> size (5.09 [*]±[*] 1.97  nm) than gAuNP 3 nm-GO (7.04 [*]±[*] 3.61  nm). Although the difference is still within the standard deviation of each sample, the result suggests that there might be some stabilizing influence of tGO with the formation of Au–S bonds between tGO and gAuNP (Table  1). The presence of stronger Au–S bonds in addition to other electrostatic interactions would provide more robust interactions between nanoparticles and GO. Thus, with the use of tGO, the immobilized AuNP would be more kinetically trapped and become slightly less susceptible to aggregation and coarsening.|$|E

The extremely small core-shell nanoparticles exhibit typical superparamagnetic behaviors with a small coercivity of 5 Oe, while the relative large nanoparticles are a typical ferromagnetic material with a high coercivity of 584 Oe. In the microwave absorption tests, a low reflection loss (RL) of - 80. 3 dB and large effective bandwidth (frequency range for RL - 10 -dB) of 10. 1 GHz are obtained in the nanoparticle-paraffin composites with appropriate layer thicknesses and particle contents.

40|$|Long-term high payload {{missions}} necessitate {{the need}} for nuclear space propulsion. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) investigated several reactor designs from 1959 to 1973 {{in order to develop}} the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA). Study of planned/unplanned transients on nuclear thermal rockets is important due to {{the need for}} long-term missions. In this work, a system model based on RELAP 5 is developed to simulate loss-of-flow accidents on the Pewee I test reactor. This paper investigates the radiation heat transfer between the fuel elements and the structures around it. In addition, the impact on the core fuel element temperature and <b>average</b> <b>core</b> pressure was also investigated. The following expected results were achieved: (i) greater than normal fuel element temperatures, (ii) fuel element temperatures exceeding the uranium carbide melting point, and (iii) <b>average</b> <b>core</b> pressure less than normal. Results show that the radiation heat transfer rate between fuel elements and cold surfaces increases with decreasing flow rate through the reactor system. However, radiation heat transfer decreases when there is a complete LOFA. When there is a complete LOFA, the peripheral coolant channels of the fuel elements handle most of the radiation heat transfer.

40|$|Several {{experimental}} {{techniques have}} been used to investigate the chemical physical properties of new functionalized ultra-small iron oxide nanoparticles (USPION), which are of interest for biomedical applications. Methods: The chemical composition of oleate-coated iron oxide (OA-NPs) and cystine-coated iron oxide (Cy-NPs) nanoparticles was investigated by means of analytical methods and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) investigations, at high and low resolutions, on both OA-NPs and Cy-NPs, were performed to investigate their morphology. The magnetization and susceptibility behavior of OA-NPs and Cy-NPs were studied by SQUID magnetometry. Results: The combination of different experimental techniques was of help in characterizing the chemical structure of both magnetic core and surface-coating of OA-NPs and Cy-NPs. AFM/TEM images and magnetic measurements were analyzed in terms of crystallinity, polidispersity, average magnetic core size and coating effects of these nanoparticles. Conclusions: These results show that the preparations reported in the present paper are effective in obtaining nanoparticles of 4 nm magnetic core size and the procedure is highly reproducible. The presence of the external cystine shell, fundamental for biomedical applications, does not affect the polidispersity, the crystallinity or the <b>average</b> <b>core</b> size.

In addition, the core analysis data are relevant for calibrating the log-based porosity and permeability interpretations (Fig.  10). Less core material exists from the lower part of the Gassum formation and the geological conditions that prevailed during deposition of the lower part differ from those of the upper part (Nielsen et al. 1989; Nielsen 2003). With respect to permeability, the core analyses show that the overall Stenlille permeability is approximately a factor 2 less than the permeability estimated from the general, basin-scale model (Fig.  9). The lower average permeability values observed at Stenlille are presumably caused by dominance of finer-grained sandstone compared to the sandstones defining the general permeability model. The presence of fine-grained reservoir sandstones at Stenlille is evidenced by sedimentological core log descriptions of the Stenlille- 1 core (Nielsen et al. 1989). The permeabilities of these sandstones (Fig.  8) are generally lower than commonly seen in Gassum formation sandstones deposited elsewhere, and the lower permeability level at Stenlille may therefore be linked to grain size.|$|R
