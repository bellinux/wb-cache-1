40|$|In {{the last}} ten years, {{a new type of}} modern polymer, known as {{swelling}} elastomer, has been used extensively as <b>a</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>element</b> in the oil and gas industry. These elastomers have been instrumental in various new applications such as water shut off, zonal isolation, and sidetracking. Though swell packers can significantly reduce costs and increase productivity, their failure can lead to serious losses. The integrity and reliability of swelling elastomer seals under different field conditions is a major concern. The investigation of changes in material behavior over a specified swelling period is a necessary first step for performance evaluation of elastomer seals. The current study is based on experimental analysis of changes in geometric and mechanical behavior (hardness, tensile, compressive, bulk) of an elastomeric material due to swelling. Tests were carried out before and after various stages of swelling. Specimens were placed in saline water (0. 6 % and 12 % concentrations) at a temperature of 50 °C, with the total swelling period being one month. Swelling, hardness, compression, and bulk tests were conducted using disc samples, while ring samples were used for tensile experiments. A small test rig was designed and constructed for determination of bulk modulus. Stress-strain curves under tension and compression, and pressure volumetric-strain curves were obtained for specimens subjected to different swelling periods. Due to the fast-swell nature of the elastomer, there were sharp changes in mechanical properties within {{the first few days of}} swelling for both salinities. Elastic modulus derived from tensile and compressive tests showed a 90 % decrease in the first few days. Bulk modulus showed fluctuation in its variation with an increasing swelling period.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} a dual gradient riser system, adapted for operations in the Gulf of Mexico and subjected to first- and second-order wave forces, current and rig/vessel motion. Deep water drilling in narrow pressure zones pose several challenges for handling well pressure. Using two separate fluid volumes, in {{what is known as}} a dual gradient drilling (DGD) solution, the hydrostatic well pressure can be reduced by managing the return flow. To separate these volumes and control the mud return, the riser must accommodate a device known as a rotating control device (RCD). The RCD and the well pressure system extends the capabilities of conventional drilling schemes allowing for operations in deeper water and narrower pressure zones. The two volumes are closed off using <b>a</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>element</b> in the RCD, which holds the differential pressure created by the drilling system. The seal operate in a hostile environment resulting in extensive wear originating from abrasive particles, the rotating drillpipe and dynamic forces from the sheltering riser. The abrasion related to friction contact is strongly coupled with the riser and drillpipe contact and prompt the need for a closer analysis of the forces occurring between them. The riser system and RCD is therefore modelled in SIMA/RIFLEX and a dynamic analysis is carried out to obtain the lateral drillpipe/riser contact forces, indirectly finding the forces affecting the seal element. The analysis results indicate that the lateral force is below 4 % of the seal element?s clamp force. The force magnitude is modest and will most likely have no significant impact on the operation. However, local forces and vibrations associated with resonance can create undesirable effects, which over time can lead to fatigue damage of the RCD and its subcomponents. Submerged equipment will be sensitive to range of resonance phenomena originating from the rig motions, second-order wave forces, current and vortex induced vibrations. This will encourage a review of the local dynamics and the potential use of riser control. Motivated by this, a finite element model is developed in Matlab/SIMULINK to study this in more detail. In order to de- tect resonance related vibrations, a modal decomposition model is formulated based on the finite element model. Using the modal model, a weighted estimate of the eigen frequencies active in the response can be provided to evaluate the resonance properties of the riser. To obtain {{a better understanding of the}} riser system and the control potential, a dynamic analysis of the models is carried out, focusing on low frequent rig/vessel motion. Both models are throughly verified using the commercial program RIFLEX, to ensure the sufficient accuracy. Inspired by the results from the analysis, control strategies based on manipulation of the resonance properties (modal con- trol) of the riser are examined, applied to a riser management system framework. The purpose of modal control is to increase safety margins and the operational economy, e. g. by reducing the time spent suspended because of seal element exchange or the risk for well head fatigue. Four different strategies based on manipulation of tension and position are proposed. Followed by a qualitative evaluation of the practical aspects, indicating that setpoint chasing and tension control are the most effective and attainable strategies available. The main contributions in this thesis are assessment of the lateral contact force associated with a deep water pipe-in-pipe dual gradient riser in the Gulf of Mexico, the development and verification of a extensive riser model using Matlab and SIMULINK, and the formulation of modal riser control for resonance vibrations in deep water drilling risers. </p...|$|E

The 1st BCT began the concerted offensive to clear Ramadi of AQI fighters; on 29 September 2006, whilst at a rooftop overwatch position, Petty Officer Michael A.

When drilling such environment, the requirement for safety, reliability and operational efficiency of down hole tools is vital. An evaluation of different drill pipe convoyed seal plugs is performed with respect to plug features, benefits,operational procedure and limitations. A comparison based on the different plug design and a review of applications for such plugs is made. Design requirements stated in ISO 14310 :Petroleum and Natural Gas Industries, Downhole Equipment, Packers and Bridge Plugs, is presented and related challenges and technology gaps discussed. An investigation of plug failure and reason for failure between January 2009 and March 2010 is carried out. Normally, down hole <b>seal</b> plugs uses <b>an</b> elastomeric <b>sealing</b> <b>element</b> to provide the seal against the casing wall. The plugs are rated to different temperatures and pressures due to the variation {{in the design of the}} elastomeric <b>sealing</b> <b>element.</b> When operating with elastomers, proper material selection is important to construct a wide performance envelop of the seal,making the seal more flexible with respect to working area. A possible new technology for down hole sealing application is metal-to-metal sealing. Metal-to-metal sealing shows superior seal reliability compared conventional <b>a</b> resilient elastomer <b>seal</b> with respect to pressure and temperature rating. This technology may become the new solution to provide <b>a</b> <b>seal</b> with ahigh integrity level in extreme well environments. This technology is new, and does not meet the requirements stated in ISO 14310. V 0 qualication is required for casing plugs acting as a secondary well barrier used by Statoil. The survey of application utilizing drill pipe convoyed seal plugs shows the most common application for casing suspensions plugs is to act as a secondary well barrier and to provide <b>a</b> gas tight <b>seal</b> for temporary abandonment of the wellbore when pulling the blow out preventer and the marine drilling riser. The present plugs used by Statoil shows good reliability and are efficient in use. However,limitations are seen when operating in extreme wells with difficult well trajectories. An improvement in design on plugs to be used in such wells is to make the plug able to be set and retrieved without rotation, making control of the applied forces on the plug more easily. The investigation of plug failure shows a decrease in failure trend after the implementation of ISO 14310 in 2005. In the time period investigated, a total of 350 plug runs where performed with a recorded failure rate of 9 %. The main reason of failure in this period is pressure test failure of the plug, making up 57 % of the reason of failure. Before the ISO 14310 become operative the main area of failure was when latching on the running/retrieving tool to the plug. </p...|$|R
40|$|TutorialFlexible <b>sealing</b> <b>elements,</b> {{typically}} elastomeric O-rings {{are commonly}} used to contain fluids within pressurized cavities of turbomachinery at the interfaces between adjoining components. All too often the only selection criteria applied for these <b>sealing</b> <b>element</b> is chemical resistance and a check that the service conditions are within the published temperature limits for the material being considered. This seemingly simplistic selection process can be complicated when the fluid in question, comprised of numerous constituents that dictate several different elastomeric materials, would normally be the optimal selection. Furthermore {{in the case of}} duties where the fluid (typically gas) pressure is elevated, some additional considerations also become more prominent due to explosive decompression (ED) damage that can occur during rapid depressurization events in the pressurized system. Despite the effects of ED being well documented, there is still a relative lack of understanding regarding what makes <b>a</b> <b>sealing</b> device ?ED resistant? and why. This tutorial goes through the composition of flexible <b>sealing</b> <b>element</b> materials and how they compare with a more widely understood engineering material; steel. It also focuses on sizing issues and international standards and how they are applied in given applications. Thermal considerations will also be addressed and an appreciation of the methods used to test such materials will be covered. In addition to ED topics being fully addressed there will also be other issues covered such as storage and longevity, modulus, strength, hardness, elongation, compression set, and stress relaxation. Lastly, although this tutorial focuses mainly on O-rings it can equally be applied to any elastomeric sealing material used in the turbomachinery industry...|$|R

The <b>sealing</b> <b>elements</b> are typically made from a material (expanded graphite, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), vermiculite, etc.) suitable to the process fluid and application.|$|R
30|$|Since forces {{transmitted}} at {{the points}} of contact are composed of normal forces and frictional (tangential) forces (Johnson 1985), the slot walls support the <b>seal</b> <b>element</b> by both the normal component and the friction component. While the coarse particles set in place as the first barrier, the normal and frictional forces control the equilibrium of the <b>seal.</b> <b>As</b> discussed above, better force distribution improves both the normal and friction force distribution to be more uniform within the <b>seal</b> <b>element.</b> Improving the normal force distribution to the walls also improves the friction, and the better the friction the higher the <b>seal</b> <b>element</b> can withstand the load. Overall, the load can be transferred more uniformly toward the slot walls and better shared among the particles, resulting in higher seal integrity. The results from adding {{a good portion of}} fine particles such as adding hematite, barite or fine-sieved barite seem to coherently support this idea. Fine particles appear to stay everywhere they could occupy the void space and essentially contribute in stress distribution of the granular system, but more importantly, they should be the material properties that takes responsibility for the impermeable capability of the seal at the upstream surface.|$|R
