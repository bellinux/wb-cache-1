Moreover, the differences in hardness and microstructure of samples of the investigated steel in relationship to the heat treatment were evaluated. Design/methodology/approach: CHT diagram, illustrating the kinetics of phase transformations during continuous heating (tempering) from <b>as-quenched</b> <b>state</b> of investigated steel, was elaborated using a DT 1000 dilatometer of a French company Adamel. In the case of investigations of the microstructural changes, quenched samples were heated with a heating rate of 0. 05 °C/s to the temperatures of 150, 280 and 650 °C. The microstructure of investigated steel were examined using light microscope Axiovert 200 MAT, scanning electron microscope Stereoscan 120 and transmission JEM 200 CX microscope. The measurements of hardness were performed with the Vickers HPO 250 apparatus. Findings: Heating of the investigated steel from the <b>as-quenched</b> <b>state</b> resulted in the occurrence of 4 primary transformations: precipitation of ε carbide, M 3 C precipitation, transformation of retained austenite and precipitation of alloy carbides of MC and M 2 C type, nucleating independently.

Upon isothermal annealing at 600 °C, nano-sized κ-carbides form, as characterized by TEM and APT. The resultant alloy exhibits high strength and excellent ductility accompanied by a high constant strain hardening rate. In comparison to the <b>as-quenched</b> κ-free <b>state,</b> the precipitation of κ-carbides leads to {{a significant increase in}} yield strength (∼ 480 MPa) without sacrificing much tensile elongation. To study the strengthening and strain hardening behavior of the precipitation-hardened material, deformation microstructures were analyzed at different strain levels. TEM and correlative TEM/APT results show that the κ-carbides are primarily sheared by lattice dislocations, gliding on the typical face-centered-cubic (fcc) slip system { 111 }, leading to particle dissolution and solute segregation. Ordering strengthening is the predominant strengthening mechanism. As the deformation substructure is characterized by planar slip bands, we quantitatively studied the evolution of the slip band spacing during straining to understand the strain hardening behavior. A good agreement between the calculated flow stresses and the experimental data suggests that dynamic slip band refinement is the main strain hardening mechanism. The influence of κ-carbides on mechanical properties is discussed by comparing the results with that of the same alloy in the <b>as-quenched,</b> κ-free <b>state...</b>|$|R

APT demonstrates that Sn clusters form independently of Cu in the <b>as-quenched</b> (AQ) <b>state</b> in Al- 1. 7 Cu- 0. 01 Sn alloy. The Sn clusters lead to the rapid nucleation of β-Sn precipitates during increased temperature aging. The APT analysis also indicates that Cu tends to cluster with Sn when the increased temperature aging commences.

40|$|Purpose: The {{reason for}} writing {{this paper was}} to {{describe}} the kinetics of phase transformations during continuous heating from quenched state. In this investigation two high-speed steels of the variable concentration of W and Mo were used. Moreover, the differences in hardness of samples of the investigated steels {{in relationship to the}} heating rate were evaluated. Design/methodology/approach: The kinetics of phase transformations during continuous heating (tempering) from <b>as-quenched</b> <b>state</b> of investigated steels, was elaborated using a DT 1000 dilatometer of a French company Adamel. The microstructure of investigations steels in <b>as-quenched</b> <b>state</b> were examined by a light microscope Axiovert 200 MAT, scanning electron microscope Hitachi 3500 N and transmission JEM 200 CX microscope. The measurements of hardness were performed with the Vickers HPO 250 apparatus. Findings: Change of heating rate during tempering has strong influence on the temperatures of beginnings and the ends of individual transitions {{as well as on the}} accompanying dilatation effects. It was shown that in quenched high-speed steels a part of retained austenite was already transforming during heating for tempering, but its significant part transformed only during cooling process after tempering.

The acoustic properties in the as-quenched {{and in the early}} stage of annealing states show strong anomalies at the spin glass transition. These anomalies vanish for a field of 0. 07 T applied parallel to the main surface of the sample. Due to demagnetization effects the field dependence of magnetoelastic properties at Tf depends strongly on the angle between magnetic field and main surface of the sample.

The crystal was so oriented that the incident direction of the radiation was along [001] axis, and was cooled with liquid nitrogen during the exposure. The pattern of the <b>as-quenched</b> <b>state</b> was homogeneous, but each of the patterns of the aged states consisted of streaks along [100] and [010] directions and a quasi-ring around the trace of the incident beam on the film (even at the shortest ageing time. l 6 sec). The most intense regions were found in [100], [010], [100] and [010] directions on the ring. With {{the progress of the}} ageing the streaks and the ring became more intense and narrower. The results can be interpreted from points of view of the formation of the GP zones parallel to { 100 } planes ab initio, the effect of the inter-particle interference on scattering of X-rays, and the growth of the GP zones with the ageing. Guinier radius of the GP zones at each stage can be obtained from intensity change along [110], and the values are reasonably consistent with those obtained from the cross section of the streak. The presence of multi-layer zones, besides the one-layer ones, is suggested from the humps found on several intensity curves along [100] at later stages...|$|E

Elongation and size distribution of precipitates have been derived from Dark Field imaging. For each precipitation states, {{the precipitation of}} NbC is occurring on dislocations due to the <b>as-quenched</b> <b>state.</b> This precipitation mechanism leads to characteristic arrays of precipitates in which precipitates grow in a self-similar manner. A detailed study of these arrays has shown that most dislocations decorated by these arrays are edge dislocations with type line vectors. There is only one variant on a given dislocation. This selection can be interpreted by the interaction between dislocation and precipitate strain fields...|$|E

This paper presents the results of magnetization studies, carried out on bulk Fe 61 Co 10 Ti 3 Y 6 B 20 alloy when under the influence of a strong magnetic field. The alloy samples were obtained in the form of a rod 1 mm in diameter, and tested in the <b>as-quenched</b> <b>state</b> and after an isothermal annealing process, at a temperature below the crystallization temperature. It was observed that the heat treatment, carried out below crystallization temperature Tx, leads to irreversible structural relaxations, specifically reorganizing the atomic configuration within the volume of the alloy into an amorphous structure...|$|E
40|$|Enhancement of soft {{magnetic}} {{properties in the}} selected group of amorphous alloys was examined by different experimental methods. It was shown that permeability for annealed samples (at T-a for 1 h; 300 K < T-a < 900 K) plotted vs. T-a shows a maximum at which is 700, 725, 725, and 750 K for Fe 82 Nb 2 B 14 Y 2, Fe 82 Nb 2 B 14 Gd 2, Fe 82 Nb 2 B 14 Tb 2 and Fe 82 Nb 2 B 14 Dy 2 alloy, respectively. For samples after the optimization annealing permeability is at least 10 times {{higher than in the}} <b>as-quenched</b> <b>state.</b> The optimized microstructure is free of iron nanograins and corresponds to so-called relaxed amorphous phase.

40|$|Damping {{capacity}} and shear elastic modulus measurements {{have been carried}} out during precipitation in AlMgSi alloys. After the specimen has been aged at the temperature corresponding to the lowest thermoelectric power, both damping and elastic modulus increase comparing with the <b>as-quenched</b> <b>state.</b> The effect of strain amplitude was investigated in specimens aged at different temperatures. A critical strain amplitude, εc, has been observed. For strain amplitudes higher than εc, the damping capacity increases strongly with strain amplitude. In addition a relaxation peak appears around 420 K after ageing. The strong damping-amplitude effect and the relaxation peak are attributed to the breakaway of the dislocation from the solute atoms at low temperature and to the dragging of these solute atoms by the dislocations at high temperature respectively...|$|E
