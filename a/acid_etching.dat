25|$|In another {{episode that}} focused on myths {{surrounding}} electronic security devices, there was a segment on defeating biometric fingerprint readers using various methods. One of these techniques involved creating a fake 3D fingerprint from a 2D image of the authorized print. After some trial and error, the team successfully cast a viable ballistics gel reproduction using a copper-coated circuit board, {{a picture of the}} fingerprint printed on acetate, and a photochemical <b>acid</b> <b>etching</b> process. After the reproduction was shown to defeat both fingerprint scanners, and although the chemicals used during the etching process are never identified, the narrator still hints at an important step having been edited out and discourages viewers from trying it themselves. None of the other techniques that successfully defeated the fingerprint scanners or the other security devices tested in the episode were censored or obfuscated, perhaps because the rest were all fairly simple and straightforward methods, such as holding up a bedsheet or moving extremely slowly to hide from ultrasonic motion detectors or holding up a pane of glass to defeat thermal motion detectors.|$|E

40|$|Some implant {{manufactures}} use Al 2 O 3 instead TiO 2 {{powder to}} sandblast the machined dental implant, because Al 2 O 3 powder is commercially more easily available and is cheaper than TiO 2 powder. However, Al 2 O 3 powder usually leaves aluminum oxide contamination on the surface, which is potentially toxic. In this work, we subjected Ti discs previously sandblasted with Al 2 O 3 powder to 5 different <b>acid</b> <b>etchings</b> {{in order to}} verify which treatment is able to remove incorporated particles of Al 2 O 3 from the surface. One group of samples were only sandblasted and served as control. The samples were analyzed by electron microscopy (SEM, EDS), scanning probe microscopy, and grazing incidence XRD. The control group showed presence of Al 2 O 3 on the surface. Three <b>acid</b> <b>etchings</b> were efficient in removing the alumina from the tested samples. Almost all the tested samples showed higher roughness parameters values than the control samples. Titanium hydride was found in almost all test groups. Moreover, {{the results suggest that}} there is no incorporation of the whole Al 2 O 3 particle into the titanium surface after the collision, conversely a particle fragmentation occurs and what remains on the titanium surface are Al 2 O 3 residues...|$|R

30|$|The {{macroporous}} {{silicon etching}} bath contains HF {{with an initial}} concentration of 1.5 [*]mol[*]L− 1 and acetic acid as a wetting agent. The F-ISE has been found here to generate precise results with no influence of the acetic acid. However, titration is not a suitable method for the HF determination in acetic <b>acid</b> containing <b>etching</b> baths. This is because the acetic acid is a buffering solution. Thus, addition of hydroxide ions (OH-) - {{as in the case}} of sodium hydroxide - or hydronium ions (H 3 O+) will not lead to a change in pH. Therefore, an adjustment of the pH in the required range is not possible, and no sufficient reaction of lanthanum nitrate with fluoride ions will occur. As a result, the HF content of acetic <b>acid</b> containing <b>etching</b> solutions can only be measured with F-ISE.|$|R

50|$|In {{intaglio}} printing, {{the lines}} to be printed are cut into a metal plate by means either of {{a cutting tool}} called a burin, held in the hand - {{in which case the}} process is called engraving; or through the corrosive action of acid - in which case the process is known as etching. In etching, for example, the plate is covered in a resin ground or an acid-resistant wax material. Using an etching needle, or a similar tool, the image is engraved into the ground, revealing the plate underneath. The plate is then dipped into acid. The acid bites into the surface of the plate where it was exposed. Biting is a printmaking term to describe the <b>acid's</b> <b>etching,</b> or incising, of the image. After the plate is sufficiently bitten, the plate is removed from the acid bath, and the ground is removed to prepare for the next step in printing.|$|R
