5|$|The Indiamen {{were not}} unprotected: each one {{was large and}} powerfully built <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> a number of cannon. Streatham and Europe weighed over 800 tons each <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> 30 cannon, whereas the smaller Lord Keith was 600 tons <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> 12 guns. Four years earlier, a convoy of East Indiamen had driven off a French ship {{of the line and}} {{attached}} frigates under Admiral Linois in similar waters by forming a battle line and firing on their opponents as they closed. The crews of these East Indiamen were not of Royal Navy standard, however, with insufficient training and large numbers of Chinese and lascar seamen, who proved unreliable in combat.|$|E

5|$|Although the Skyraider {{was a third}} smaller <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> a third less bombload, {{it proved}} more {{reliable}} in service and easier to fly and land, and Navy pilots preferred it.

The aircraft operated with reserve squadrons until 1953.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Reversible {{logic is}} {{emerging}} as a promising computing paradigm, having its applications in low-power CMOS, quantum computing, nanotech-nology and optical computing. Firstly, we showed a modified design of conventional BCD subtractors and also proposed designs of <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD subtractors. The proposed designs of <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD subtractors {{are based on the}} novel designs of <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD adders, respectively. Then, we introduced the reversible logic implementation of the modified conventional, as well as the proposed, <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD subtractors efficient {{in terms of the number}} of reversible gates used and garbage output produced. To the best of our knowledge, the <b>carry</b> look-ahead <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> skip BCD subtractors and their reversible logic design are explored for the first time ever in literature...|$|R
5000|$|A Pick <b>and</b> <b>Carry</b> Crane {{is similar}} to a mobile crane in that is {{designed}} to travel on public roads; however, Pick <b>and</b> <b>Carry</b> cranes have no stabiliser legs or outriggers and are designed to lift the load <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> it to its destination, within a small radius, then be able to drive to the next job. Pick <b>and</b> <b>Carry</b> cranes are popular in Australia where large distances are encountered between job sites. One popular manufacturer in Australia was Franna, who have since been bought by Terex, and now all Pick <b>and</b> <b>Carry</b> cranes are commonly referred to as [...] "Frannas" [...] even though they may be made by other manufacturers. Nearly every medium and large sized crane company in Australia has at least one and many companies have fleets of these cranes. The capacity range is usually ten to twenty tonnes maximum lift, although this is much less {{at the tip of the}} boom. Pick <b>and</b> <b>Carry</b> cranes have displaced the work usually completed by smaller truck cranes as the set-up time is much quicker. Many steel fabrication yards also use Pick <b>and</b> <b>Carry</b> cranes as they can [...] "walk" [...] with fabricated steel sections and place these where required with relative ease.|$|R
