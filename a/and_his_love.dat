5|$|The ballad {{speaks of}} the Wabash River, which flows through Indiana, and reminisces about events that {{occurred}} there. The song has two verses and a chorus. The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>love</b> for his mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While the subjects of the verses are connected, the narrative of the chorus is detached from the verses as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.|$|E

After being admitted to a mental hospital, it is revealed that Helen actually sexually abused {{him when he was}} young, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>love</b> for her (and empathy for her troubled youth) caused him to repress his traumatic memories. This psychological damage explains his flashbacks and derealization phases throughout the book. In two months Charlie is released, and Sam and Patrick visit him. In the epilogue, Sam, Patrick and Charlie go through the tunnel again and Charlie stands up and exclaims that he felt infinite.|$|E

5|$|Some LGBT {{interpretations of}} popular stories and {{characters}} have been controversial. Ganeśa: Lord of obstacles, Lord of beginnings, applied psychoanalytic approaches to Hindu stories. The book stated that Ganesha's trunk represented a flaccid penis <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>love</b> of sweets indicated {{a desire to}} perform homosexual oral sex. The deductions of this book, and similar application of psychoanalysis {{to the study of}} Hinduism, has been questioned by Western and Indian academics including Antonio De Nicholas, Krishnan Ramaswamy, S.N.Balagangadhara, Saraha Claerhout, who have stated that the book is based on mistranslations and psychoanalytic misinterpretations. The book became infamous in India, triggering protests and resulting in a public apology from the publishers and withdrawal of the book in India.|$|E

The last scenes feature the band member's instruments spraying paint when played continually, a girl dancing seductively, and Levine <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>love</b> interest passionately embracing - all while covered in grey paint.

5|$|Chad Harris-Crane is {{the main}} love {{interest}} and later husband of Whitney Russell; {{he is also the}} father of Miles Davis Harris-Crane and another child. Chad's early appearances focus on his search for his biological parents, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>love</b> triangle with sisters Whitney and Simone. Chad is initially believed to be Eve and Julian's child, which would make his relationship with Whitney incestuous. Chad's birth certificate later proves he was conceived when Alistair Crane raped Eve's adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne. He reunites with Whitney without the stigma of incest. During his separation from Whitney, Chad initiates a sexual relationship with Vincent Clarkson and continues it after his marriage. He is unaware he is committing incest because he is Vincent's half-uncle, adoptive half-cousin, and half-brother-in-law. After catching Chad having sex with Vincent, Whitney files for divorce; they later begin to reconcile through helping Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald and Ethan Winthrop reunite as a couple. Their potential reconciliation is cut short when Chad is murdered by Alistair.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 2001, After Forever {{appeared}} as rising stars on the dynamic scene of Dutch metal, which included bands like The Gathering, Within Temptation, Gorefest and Ayreon. Their second album Decipher (2001) had received very positive reviews and their name was {{well known in the}} underground scene of the Netherlands. Critics were impressed by the remarkable musicianship of the young members of the band and in particular by Floor Jansen’s vocals, both in studio and in live performances. In contrast with these premises for a bright future, the relationships within the band were not so idyllic. Soon after the release of Decipher, After Forever faced a strong creative contrast between founding member and guitarist Mark Jansen {{and the rest of the}} band. Mark Jansen had been the main composer of the band together with Sander Gommans <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>love</b> for movie soundtracks and classical music had had a strong influence on the musical style of After Forever’s first two albums, Prison of Desire (2000) and Decipher. Moreover, his interest for religious and moral themes had characterized his lyrics for many songs, often collected under a common title (e.g. The Embrace That Smothers and My Pledge of Allegiance). In the next album, Mark Jansen meant to further explore complex interactions between classical instruments, choruses in Latin and death metal elements, while Gommans and the others preferred a more direct and aggressive approach to music, retaining some elements that made the sound of the band recognizable, but expanding it in new and different directions. These musical differences led to Mark Jansen leaving the band, in what he felt as an actual dismissal.|$|E

25|$|Sonnet 147 {{is one of}} 154 sonnets {{written by}} English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. Sonnet 147 is written from the {{perspective}} of a poet who regards the love he holds for his mistress and lover as a sickness, and more specifically, as a fever. The sonnet details the internal battle the poet has between his reason (or head) and the love he has for his mistress (his heart). As he realizes his love is detrimental to his health and stability, perhaps even fatal, the poet's rationality attempts to put an end to the relationship. Eventually, however, the battle between the poet's reason <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>love</b> comes to an end. Unable to give up his lover, the poet gives up rationale <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>love</b> becomes all consuming, sending him to the brink of madness.|$|E

25|$|God in Christianity is {{the eternal}} being who created and {{preserves}} all things.
