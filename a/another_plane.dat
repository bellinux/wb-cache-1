5|$|Over {{the course}} of his forty-seven years in {{designing}} and building planes, Verville contributed to the design and development of nearly twenty different aircraft. A plane he designed, the Verville-Sperry M-1 Messenger is on permanent exhibition at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. <b>Another</b> <b>plane</b> he designed, the Verville-Sperry R-3 Racer won first place at the 1924 Pulitzer Trophy Races. In June 1961, it was honored as one of the twelve most significant aircraft of all time by Popular Mechanics and it was featured on a USPS airmail stamp issued in 1985.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Tintin finds {{electric}} cables and red beacons in the garden, surmising {{that they are}} there designed to attract a plane drop. At night, he lights the flares, and finds that planes drops sacks of counterfeit money, revealing that Müller {{is part of a}} gang of forgers. He pursues Müller and his accomplice Ivan and along the way, Thompson and Thomson try to arrest him again, but he convinces them to follow him. When Müller takes a plane north, Tintin and Snowy try to follow, but hit a storm and crash land in rural Scotland. The detectives commandeer <b>another</b> <b>plane,</b> but discover too late that the man they told to fly it is actually a mechanic who has never flown before, and after a harrowing air-bound odyssey they end up crash-landing into (and winning) an aerobatics competition.|$|E
5|$|When Dante next meets Trish, she betrays him {{and reveals}} that she too {{is working for}} Mundus, but when her life is endangered, Dante chooses to save her. Claiming he did so only because of her {{resemblance}} to his mother, he warns her to stay away. Yet when he finally confronts Mundus, {{who is about to}} kill Trish, Dante again chooses to save her and is injured. Mundus tries to finish him off, but Trish takes the attack instead. This unleashes Dante's full power, thus allowing him to take on the form of Sparda. Dante and Mundus then battle on <b>another</b> <b>plane</b> of existence.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins with}} the Hero dreaming that he meets the Law Hero, the Chaos Hero, and a woman named Yuriko; she {{promises}} that she will become the Hero's partner. He wakes up, and receives an e-mail with a computer program for summoning demons attached. While out on an errand, he learns that a scientist has opened a portal to the Abyss, which allows demons to enter Tokyo. He also meets Yuriko, who says she will fulfill her promise. The next night, the Hero again dreams that he meets the Law Hero and Chaos Hero, and that they save the Heroine from a sacrificial ritual. The next day, he meets the Law Hero and Chaos Hero in reality; they reveal {{that they had the}} same dreams. News of the demons spread, and the US military, led by ambassador Thorman, decides to intervene. The Japan Self-Defense Forces, led by general Gotou, opposes them, as they see demons as the ancient spirits of the land. A third group, led by the Heroine, tries to prevent conflict between the other two. She gets captured by Gotou's forces; they are about to publicly execute her under supervision by Yuriko, but she is saved by the Hero, Law Hero, and Chaos Hero. Players can choose to support Thorman or Gotou, or to reject both; regardless of what they choose, the conflict escalates until Thorman launches missiles towards Tokyo. The Heroine is killed, but saves the Hero, Law Hero, and Chaos Hero by using magic to teleport them to <b>another</b> <b>plane</b> of existence.|$|E

The plane {{landed on a}} minivan {{traveling}} down nearby Interstate 680 in Pleasant Hill and nearly severed the left leg of a 12-year-old girl (Her leg was successfully reattached and she has made a near full recovery). Officials determined the crash was the fault of a mechanic who had worked on the plane.|$|E
40|$|Four {{experiments}} investigated whether directing {{attention to}} a particular plane in depth enables observers to filter out information from <b>another</b> depth <b>plane.</b> Observers viewed stereoscopic displays and searched for a red line segment among green line segments. The results showed that directing {{attention to a}} particular depth plane cannot prevent attentional capture from <b>another</b> depth <b>plane</b> when {{the colors of the}} target and distractor are identical. However, it can prevent attentional capture by a singleton from <b>another</b> depth <b>plane</b> when the colors of the target and distractor are different. These results indicate that only when both color and depth information are selective in guiding attention to the target singleton can attentional capture by irrelevant singletons be prevented. The results also suggest that retinal disparity does not have the same special status as location information in two dimensions and should be considered as just another feature along which selection may occu...|$|R

Alternatively, the local phase errors can be used directly to calculate the deformable mirror instructions.|$|E
25|$|It is {{sufficient}} to prove the theorem when the conic is a circle, because any (non-degenerate) conic {{can be reduced to}} a circle by a projective transformation. This was realised by Pascal, whose first lemma states the theorem for a circle. His second lemma states that what is true in one plane remains true upon projection to <b>another</b> <b>plane.</b> Degenerate conics follow by continuity (the theorem is true for non-degenerate conics, and thus holds in the limit of degenerate conic).|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the floor}} shift lever also has <b>another</b> <b>plane</b> of operation, for manual mode, with {{spring-loaded}} + and − positions.

Sighting a railroad, Wolfe and Usher followed it for some time until it ended. Lost and having engine trouble, they landed and were taken into custody by Mexican officials. The tracks they had steered by ran due south instead of west, and had led them to Nacozari, Sonora, seventy-five or eighty miles below the border. Though treated well, Wolfe and Usher were not set free until 2 February. They waited three more days for release of their airplane, shipping it to Douglas by train.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>another</b> <b>plane</b> was {{prepared}} for the passengers, Gleason {{had had enough of}} flying. He went into downtown Tulsa, walked into a hardware store, and asked its owner to lend him $200 for the train trip to New York. The owner asked Gleason why he thought anyone would lend a stranger so much money. Gleason identified himself and explained his situation. The store owner said he would lend the money if the local theater had a photo of Gleason in his latest film. But the publicity shots showed only the principal stars. Gleason proposed to buy two tickets to the movie and take the store owner; {{he would be able to}} see the actor in action. The two men watched the movie for an hour before Gleason appeared on screen. The owner gave Gleason the loan, and he took the next train to New York.

25|$|Johnson {{reported}} to General Douglas MacArthur in Australia. Johnson and two U.S. Army officers {{went to the}} 22nd Bomb Group base, which was assigned the high risk mission of bombing the Japanese airbase at Lae in New Guinea. Johnson's roommate was an army second lieutenant who was a B-17 bomber pilot. On June 9, 1942, Johnson volunteered as an observer for an air strike mission on New Guinea by eleven B-26 bombers that included his roommate in <b>another</b> <b>plane.</b> While on the mission, his roommate and his crew's B-26 bomber was shot down {{with none of the}} eight men surviving the crash into the water. Reports vary on what happened to the B-26 bomber carrying Johnson during that mission. Johnson's biographer Robert Caro accepts Johnson's account, and supports it with testimony from the aircrew concerned: the aircraft was attacked, disabling one engine, and it turned back before reaching its objective, though remaining under heavy fire. Others claim that it turned back because of generator trouble before reaching the objective and before encountering enemy aircraft and never came under fire. This is said to be supported by official flight records.|$|E
