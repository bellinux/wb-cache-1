40|$|We {{present the}} results of the latest {{multicolor}} Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKID) focal plane arrays in the submillimeter. The new detectors on the arrays are superconducting resonators which combine a coplanar waveguide section with an interdigitated capacitor, or IDC. To avoid out-of-band pickup by the capacitor, a stepped-impedance filter is used to prevent radiation from reaching the absorptive <b>aluminum</b> <b>section</b> of the resonator. These arrays are tested in the preliminary demonstration instrument, DemoCam, a precursor to the Multicolor Submillimeter Inductance Camera, MUSIC. We present laboratory results of the responsivity to light both in the laboratory and at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory. We assess the performance of the detectors in filtering out-of-band radiation, and find the level of excess load and its effect on detector performance. We also look at the array design characteristics, and the implications for the optimization of sensitivities expected by MUSIC...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Numerical {{predictions}} of characteristics of turbulent flows through a square duct (30 × 30 mm) with twisted tape inserts and with twisted tape inserts plus interrupted ribs are conducted to investigate regionally averaged heat transfer and friction factors by using CFX 11. 0 commercial code. The {{validity of the}} numerical results is confirmed by measurement. Reynolds numbers are varied between 8, 900 and 29, 000. A rib height-to-channel hydraulic diameter (e/Dh) of 0. 067 and a length-to hydraulic diameter (L/Dh) of 30 are considered. The square ribs are arranged to follow the trace of the twisted tape and along the flow direction defined as axial interrupted ribs. The twisted tape is 0. 1 mm thick carbon steel sheet with diameter of 28 mm, length of 900 mm and 2. 5 turns. Each wall of the square channel is composed of the isolated <b>aluminum</b> <b>section.</b> The present study demonstrates that the twisted tape with interrupted ribs provides a greater overall heat transfer performance over the twisted tape with no ribs in the square duct...|$|E

40|$|The Next Generation Large Canadarm (NGLC) {{ground test}} bed is {{constrained}} by the physical stowage volume available on future exploration vehicles. NGLC demonstrates {{a reduction in the}} launch package of a large manipulator system while maintaining reach capability through deployment and retraction. NGLC is comprised of two telescoping segments, connected by three pitch joints. The segments consist of an inner and outer boom with a lock mechanism for either position. A rail network allows relative translation of the booms. NGLC bending and torsional stiffness requirements were met through the use of composite materials and adhesive bonding. Each boom features a centre composite section bonded to two <b>aluminum</b> <b>sections</b> using a stepped-lap joint. The elimination of mechanical fasteners maximized NGLC stiffness through a reduction of the clearance required between the telescoping assemblies and an increase of the inner segment diameter. Progressive damage finite element (FE) models optimized the lay-up and predicted positive margins of safety for combined bending and torsion load cases. Continuum mechanics analysis of the bonded joint was used to predict adhesive and adherend stresses due to the applied loads. A modular bonding apparatus with constrained relative adherend translation accommodated customized bonding processes for each operation. Steel rail segments were simultaneously bonded to the composite section inner surfaces, while the composite and <b>aluminum</b> <b>sections</b> were sequentially bonded. The joint and the bonding processes were optimized for bondline thickness control and minimum void entrapment.

Based on analyses with validated finite-element models, this paper investigates local buckling of extruded sections with stress-strain relationships representative for fire-exposed aluminum alloys.

Three cor-ten steel plates, each 5/8" [...] X 5' X 22', are hung from steel cables and shackled together in a zigzag pattern.

The results that emerged from the robotics study also showed that {{there were a number of}} problems in the cell that could be addressed. The study also revealed a number of other reasons why the cell could not achieve the desired production rate for example set-up times and drop spacers. The measurement of default times for each operation in the cell showed that a major reason why the robots did not work was that they had to wait for the trolley to run and leave empty baskets. The time studies work resulted in a number of different proposals for how the problems which appeared could be solved. To reduce the time it takes for the wagon to drive out empty basket we engineered a solution that uses chain conveyors to move the empty basket out off the workstation. By implementing this solution the wagon does not need to drive back and forth and thus we expect that the robot driving time could be reduced to half.

The concentrated load was applied by means of bearing plates, which act across the full flange width of the specimens. Different bearing lengths were investigated. The test specimens were fabricated by extrusion using 6063 -T 5 and 6061 -T 6 heat-treated aluminum alloys. The test specimens consisted of normal strength material (T 5) with the 0. 2 % tensile proof stress (yield stress) ranging from 189 to 196 MPa, and high strength material (T 6) with the 0. 2 % tensile proof stress ranging from 260 to 275 MPa. The measured web slenderness value of the tubular sections ranged from 31. 4 to 74. 5. The effects of the 0. 2 % proof stress and bearing length on the web crippling strength (capacity) of <b>aluminum</b> tubular <b>sections</b> were investigated.
