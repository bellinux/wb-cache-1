5|$|WCSP-FM is {{the first}} radio station to {{broadcast}} <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> historical U.S. Supreme Court oral arguments, with announcers explaining the court decision {{at the end of}} the recording. The broadcasts of the Supreme Court arguments have provided listeners in the U.S. and Canada with the opportunity to hear spoken words during oral arguments for several of the Court's most influential cases, including the Texas v. Johnson argument over flag-burning in 1989, and the Miranda v. Arizona argument in 1966. In September 2010 the Supreme Court began releasing audio recordings of the week's oral arguments each Friday, thereby allowing C-SPAN Radio to broadcast a selection of current arguments. Prior to this arrangement, recordings of oral arguments were occasionally made available on a same-day basis, which C-SPAN would request in cases of high public interest.|$|E
25|$|The Santa Barbara County sheriff {{released}} a videotape showing Jackson's arrest. They also {{released a}}n <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> his {{ride to the}} police station. In it, Jackson complains about the handcuffs and is politely told by an officer how he can relieve the discomfort. He is heard to be whistling, and he asks for the air conditioning to be turned on (it was). Police allege these tapes prove that Jackson's claims are false; Jackson, along with his family, claim that what is being shown is merely a biased portion of what actually occurred. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer ordered an independent investigation into Jackson's complaints. After interviewing 163 witnesses, the complaints were rejected in August 2004.|$|E

After the Virginia Tech shootings, Boortz criticized the media, saying, [...] "When {{the history of}} this event is written, we will have 25 {{students}} standing meekly waiting for this guy to execute them." [...] When public outrage resulted from his comments, members of the Virginia Legislature tried to have Boortz's show removed from local radio stations. In March 2008, Boortz attracted controversy by playing an <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> a nine-year-old where he repeatedly ridiculed the child’s speech, leading to an unsuccessful FCC petition to deny Boortz’s employer the right to purchase five local radio stations.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} much outcome {{research}} on interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) but little investigation of its components. This study assessed interrater reliability of IPT therapists in identifying interpersonal problem areas and treatment foci from <b>audiotapes</b> <b>of</b> initial treatment sessions. Three IPT research psychotherapists assessed up to 18 <b>audiotapes</b> <b>of</b> dysthymic patients, using the Interpersonal Problem Area Rating Scale.

Kappa for agreement on a clinical focus was 0. 82. IPT therapists agreed closely in rating problem areas and potential treatment foci, providing empirical support for potential therapist consistency in this treatment approach...|$|R

5000|$|When someone finds {{something}} funny, {{there are}} different ways of expressing it. Common responses of humor include laughing and smiling. In 2008, a study [...] was conducted using 155 undergraduate students at North London University {{in order to measure}} responses to humor using a British comedy. The participants were divided into one of three categories: watched a video of the comedy, listened to an <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> the comedy, or read a script of the comedy. Approximately half of the participants were observed by an overt video camera and half were observed by a covert video camera. Results showed that participants laughed and smiled much more frequently when watching a video of the comedy and listening to the <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> the comedy than when reading a script. The difference in the frequency of smiling and laughing between the video and the audiotape was not significant. Participants laughed and smiled more frequently when observed by a covert video camera than an overt video camera. Aspects of the video and audiotape such as visualization of the acting, auditory representation, and also the presence of audience laughter significantly increase the frequency of laughter and smiling.|$|E
