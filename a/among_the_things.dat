However, she did not witness either this first public display of the flag or the time when the flag was unfurled during the Malolos Congress because her husband remained in Hong Kong and she remained with him.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} {{after the completion}} of Shin Megami Tensei II and Shin Megami Tensei If..., but was delayed as the team worked out what they wanted for the game, including making it appeal to a wider audience than previous Megami Tensei games. Unlike the science fiction setting of Shin Megami Tensei II, Nocturne returned to a contemporary setting similar to the original game. The setting and characters were inspired by multiple elements, including Gnosticism, Mahayana Buddhism, and modern popular culture. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> the team changed from previous entries were the camera perspective, which was switched from a first- to a third-person camera perspective, and using a cel-shaded art style to distinguish it from other games of the time. The music, primarily composed by Shoji Meguro, paid homage to earlier Megami Tensei titles while drawing on music styles from the 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|Comics {{historian}} Jim Steranko {{wrote in}} 1970 that Finger's slowness {{as a writer}} led Batman editor Whitney Ellsworth to suggest Kane replace him, a claim reflected in Joe Desris' description of Finger as [...] "notoriously tardy". During Finger's absence, Gardner Fox contributed scripts that introduced Batman's early [...] "Bat-" [...] arsenal (the utility belt, the Bat-Gyro/plane and the Batarang). Upon his return, Finger created or co-created items such as the Batmobile and Batcave, and is credited with providing the name [...] "Gotham City". Finger wrote the debut issue of Batman's self-titled comic book series which introduced the Joker and the Catwoman. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that made his stories distinctive were a use of giant-sized props: enlarged pennies, sewing machines, or typewriters. Two of the prevalently featured trophies in Batman's Batcave, a full-size animatronic Tyrannosaurus Rex and a giant replica of a Lincoln penny, were both introduced in stories written by Finger.

2500|$|<b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that endeared him to {{his public}} was his comic use of {{language}} in his films; his characters (all of which were really variations of the main [...] "Cantinflas" [...] persona but cast in different social roles and circumstances) would strike up a normal conversation and then complicate it {{to the point where}} no one understood what they were talking about. The Cantinflas character was particularly adept at obfuscating the conversation when he owed somebody money, was courting an attractive young woman, or was trying to talk his way out of trouble with authorities, whom he managed to humiliate without their even being able to tell. This manner of talking became known as Cantinflear, and it became common parlance for Spanish speakers to say [...] "¡estás cantinfleando!" [...] (loosely translated as you're pulling a [...] "Cantinflas!" [...] or you're [...] "Cantinflassing!") whenever someone became hard to understand in conversation. The Real Academia Española officially included the verb, cantinflear, cantinflas and cantinflada in its dictionary in 1992.|$|E
2500|$|Knowledge {{representation}} and knowledge engineering {{are central to}} AI research. Many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that AI needs to represent are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects; situations, events, states and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of [...] "what exists" [...] is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them. The semantics of these are captured as description logic concepts, roles, and individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the Web Ontology Language. The most general ontologies are called upper ontologies, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge by acting as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). Such formal knowledge representations are suitable for content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery via automated reasoning (inferring new statements based on explicitly stated knowledge), etc. Video events are often represented as SWRL rules, which can be used, among others, to automatically generate subtitles for constrained videos.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> Muhammad did {{in order}} to settle the longstanding grievances among the tribes of Medina was {{drafting}} a document known as the Constitution of Medina (date debated), [...] "establishing a kind of alliance or federation" [...] among the eight Medinan tribes and Muslim emigrants from Mecca, which specified the rights and duties of all citizens {{and the relationship of}} the different communities in Medina (including that of the Muslim community to other communities specifically the Jews and other [...] "Peoples of the Book"). The community defined in the Constitution of Medina, umma, had a religious outlook but was also shaped by the practical considerations and substantially preserved the legal forms of the old Arab tribes. Muhammad also adopted some features of the Jewish worship and customs such as fasting on the Yom Kippur day. According to Alford Welch, the Jewish practice of having three daily prayer rituals {{appears to have been a}} factor in the introduction of the Islamic midday prayer (previously Muhammad was keeping the morning and evening prayers). Welch thinks that Muhammad's adoption of facing north towards Jerusalem when performing the daily prayers (qibla) however need not to necessarily be a borrowing from the Jews as the reports about the direction of prayer before migration to Medina are contradictory and further this direction of prayer was also practiced among other groups in Arabia.|$|E
2500|$|Where u(x, t) is {{the flow}} field, p the pressure, ρ {{the density of}} the fluid, ν the {{kinematic}} viscosity, ubd the velocity at the boundary, and us the velocity of the solid. By choosing a length scale, L, and velocity scale, U, the equation can be expressed in nondimensional form containing the Reynolds number, Re=UL/ν [...] There are two obvious differences between an insect wing and an airfoil: An insect wing is much smaller and it flaps. Using a dragonfly as an example, Its chord (c) is about 1cm, its wing length (l) about 4cm, and its wing frequency (f) about 40Hz. The tip speed (u) is about 1m/s, and the corresponding Reynolds number, Re=uc/ν about 103. At the smaller end, a Chalcid wasp has a wing length of about 0.5–0.7mm and beats its wing at about 400Hz. Its Reynolds number is about 25. The range of Reynolds number in insect flight is about 10 to 104, which lies in between the two limits that are convenient for theories: inviscid steady flows around an airfoil and Stokes flow experienced by a swimming bacterium. For this reason, this intermediate range is not well understood. On the other hand, it is perhaps the most ubiquitous regime <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> we see. Falling leaves and seeds, fishes, and birds all encounter unsteady flows similar to that seen around an insect.|$|E
2500|$|To {{further reduce}} the Polish population, a German {{official}} Krumey from occupied Łódź [...] demanded that Polish women be kept at work until reaching 8.5 months of pregnancy. The {{aim was to}} help in miscarriage and provoke [...] ‘accidents’ {{that would result in}} failed birth. Nevertheless, German officials remained extremely worried about Polish birth rate and various other ideas floated among German leadership how to not only reduce pregnancy, but to prevent it. Among the proposals were: garrisoning the population in labour camps, making the age of allowing marriage much higher, creating labour battalions out of the Polish population, introducing a child tax, performing abortions, an extended forced work duty during Polish lifetimes, combined with relocation to work camps, and finally sterilization of Polish women. Doubts about the ability to perform mass sterilization hindered this idea, however, as 55% of available doctors in certain parts of annexed territories were Poles and it was thought they would sabotage the action. The German state organization SD performed its own study on the problem. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> it concluded {{was the fact that the}} number of Poles was wrongly estimated in initial years; however, both the birth rate and survival of German children was higher than that of the Poles. The proposed solution to Polish problem was mass sterilization of lower classes (named [...] "primitives" [...] by the report), sending married Poles to slave labour in Reich. An original idea was proposed by Karl Zieger, who believed those measures to be futile. Instead, he postulated that whole Polish villages should be moved and scattered into the Reich itself.|$|E
