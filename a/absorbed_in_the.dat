5|$|Copper is an {{essential}} trace element in plants and animals, but not all microorganisms. The human body contains copper {{at a level of}} about 1.4 to 2.1mg per kg of body mass. Copper is <b>absorbed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gut, then transported to the liver bound to albumin. After processing in the liver, copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase, which involves the protein ceruloplasmin, carrying the majority of copper in blood. Ceruloplasmin also carries the copper that is excreted in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source. Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5mg a day, vs. about 1mg per day <b>absorbed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.|$|E

5|$|In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a {{theoretical}} role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special {{role in the}} radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons {{continue to be a}} radiation hazard unless actively <b>absorbed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.|$|E
5|$|Other sources include {{fortified}} food and dietary supplements in various forms. A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide, {{one of the}} most common supplements in the United States, and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly <b>absorbed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body. This review cited studies that found lower plasma zinc concentrations in the subjects who consumed zinc oxide and zinc carbonate than in those who took zinc acetate and sulfate salts. For fortification, however, a 2003 review recommended cereals (containing zinc oxide) as a cheap, stable source that is as easily absorbed as the more expensive forms. A 2005 study found that various compounds of zinc, including oxide and sulfate, did not show statistically significant differences in absorption when added as fortificants to maize tortillas.|$|E

5|$|Owing to {{its high}} radioactivity, curium and its {{compounds}} must be handled in appropriate laboratories under special arrangements. Whereas curium itself mostly emits α-particles which are absorbed by thin layers of common materials, some of its decay products emit significant fractions of beta and gamma radiation, which require a more elaborate protection. If consumed, curium is excreted {{within a few days}} and only 0.05% is <b>absorbed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood. From there, about 45% goes to the liver, 45% to the bones, and the remaining 10% is excreted. In the bone, curium accumulates {{on the inside of the}} interfaces to the bone marrow and does not significantly redistribute with time; its radiation destroys bone marrow and thus stops red blood cell creation. The biological half-life of curium is about 20 years in the liver and 50 years in the bones. Curium is <b>absorbed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body much more strongly via inhalation, and the allowed total dose of 244Cm in soluble form is 0.3 μC. Intravenous injection of 242Cm and 244Cm containing solutions to rats increased the incidence of bone tumor, and inhalation promoted pulmonary and liver cancer.|$|E

5|$|Titanium is {{non-toxic}} even {{in large}} doses {{and does not}} play any natural role inside the human body. An estimated quantity of 0.8 milligrams of titanium is ingested by humans each day, but most passes through without being <b>absorbed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tissues. It does, however, sometimes bio-accumulate in tissues that contain silica. One study indicates a possible connection between titanium and yellow nail syndrome. An unknown mechanism in plants may use titanium to stimulate the production of carbohydrates and encourage growth.

5|$|Morris {{took up the}} {{practical}} art of dyeing as a necessary adjunct of his manufacturing business.

One result of these experiments was to reinstate indigo dyeing as a practical industry and generally to renew the use of those vegetable dyes, such as the red derived from madder, which had been driven almost out of use by the anilines. Dyeing of wools, silks, and cottons was the necessary preliminary to what he had much at heart, the production of woven and printed fabrics of the highest excellence; and the period of incessant work at the dye-vat (1875–76) was followed by a period during which he was <b>absorbed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production of textiles (1877–78), and more especially in the revival of carpet-weaving as a fine art.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiment}} was suggested on 1 November 1943 by Robert Serber. The {{idea was to}} measure the spatial and temporal symmetry of explosive compression of a metal sphere. The test measured changes of absorption of gamma rays in the metal of the sphere as it underwent compression. The gamma ray source was located {{in the center of}} a metal sphere. The increase of thickness (of hollow shells) and density (of solid spheres) as the compression progressed was detected as a decrease of intensity of gamma rays outside of the sphere; the lower density explosives did not absorb gamma radiation enough to interfere with the experiment. The gamma rays had to be intense and of the right energy. Too low energy, and they would be fully <b>absorbed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surrounding metal; too high energy and the difference of attenuation during the implosion would be too low to be practical. The detectors had to provide high speed and large area; fast ionization chambers, then under development, were the only devices then available satisfying the requirements.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} radiation-induced defect {{formation}} in glasses is of growing interest for applications in optics and photonics. The influence of Tb 3 + ions on X-ray-induced defects has been examined in glasses with different phosphate contents. The defects have {{been characterized by}} optical absorption and ESR spectroscopy. (Tb 3 +) + ions are formed by X-ray irradiation. They exhibit a broad charge transfer band at 370 nm. The formation of (Tb 3 +) + hole centres suppresses the formation of intrinsic phosphate-related hole centres, <b>absorbing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> visible region. PO 3 defects <b>absorbing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ultraviolet region contribute mainly to the electron centres corresponding to the (Tb 3 +) + hole centres. Immediately after X-ray irradiation, 5 – 10 % of the Tb 3 + ions have been oxidized. The amount of (Tb 3 +) + ions increases with increasing phosphate content. The stability of the (Tb 3 +) + ions at room temperature depends on glass composition and melting conditions...|$|R

5|$|Plutonium, when {{entering}} the body through air, food or blood (e.g. a wound), mostly settles in the lungs, liver and bones with only about 10% going to other organs, and remains there for decades. The long residence time of plutonium {{in the body}} is partly explained by its poor solubility in water. Some isotopes of plutonium emit ionizing α-radiation, which damages the surrounding cells. The median lethal dose (LD50) for 30 days in dogs after intravenous injection of plutonium is 0.32 milligram per kg of body mass, and thus the lethal dose for humans is approximately 22mg for a person weighing 70kg; the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately four times greater. Another estimate assumes that plutonium is 50 times less toxic than radium, and thus permissible content of plutonium in the body should be 5µg or 0.3 µCi. Such amount is nearly invisible in under microscope. After trials on animals, this maximum permissible dose was reduced to 0.65µg or 0.04 µCi. Studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous plutonium exposure route is through inhalation, after which 5–25% of inhaled substances is retained in the body. Depending on the particle size and solubility of the plutonium compounds, plutonium is localized either in the lungs or in the lymphatic system, or is <b>absorbed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood and then transported to the liver and bones. Contamination via food is the least likely way. In this case, only about 0.05% of soluble 0.01% insoluble compounds of plutonium absorbs into blood, {{and the rest is}} excreted. Exposure of damaged skin to plutonium would retain nearly 100% of it.|$|E
