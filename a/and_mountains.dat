5|$|During the 5th century, one of {{the last}} Emperors of the Western Roman Empire, Julius Nepos, ruled his small empire from the palace. The period ends with Avar and Croat invasions {{in the first half of}} the 7th century and {{destruction}} of almost all Roman towns. Roman survivors retreated to more favourable sites on the coast, islands <b>and</b> <b>mountains.</b> The city of Dubrovnik was founded by such survivors from Epidaurum.|$|E
5|$|From mid-1942 through mid-1944, the Filipino guerrilla {{resistance}} {{had been}} supplied and encouraged by U.S. Navy submarines {{and a few}} parachute drops, so that the guerrillas could harass the Japanese Army and {{take control of the}} rural areas, jungles <b>and</b> <b>mountains</b> – thus, the Japanese Empire only controlled 12 out of 48 provinces. While remaining loyal to the United States, many Filipinos hoped and believed that liberation from the Japanese would bring them freedom and their already-promised independence.|$|E

5|$|Chinese Nü Yr is an electronica album using {{elements}} of bass, grime and 2-step garage.

Xiāngjiāo is forced to go through portals in colorful and nonsensical lands, having to dodge things such as peanuts, floating fruit, pink-colored fog, <b>and</b> <b>mountains</b> growing out of the ground. Xiāngjiāo fears both the unfamiliarity of future lands and the extreme speed at which it travels. In a December 2015 interview, Malliagh stated the fate of the worm will occur in a full-length album.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its size}} and {{geologic}} features such as the Balcones Fault, Texas contains diverse landscapes that resemble both the U.S. Southern and Southwestern regions. Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts, less than 10% of Texas' land area is desert. Most of the population centers are located in areas of former prairies, grasslands, forests, and the coastline. Traveling from east to west, one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods, to rolling plains and rugged hills, and finally the desert <b>and</b> <b>mountains</b> of the Big Bend.|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Siege {{is set in}} the Kingdom of Ehb, {{a varied}} region on the {{continent}} of Aranna containing deserts, swamps, forests, <b>and</b> <b>mountains,</b> created three centuries earlier at the dissolution of the Empire of Stars. At the beginning of the game, the player character's farming village is attacked by a race of creatures named the Krug. The main character, a farmer with no given background who is named by the player, journeys through the Krug forces to the town of Stonebridge. Upon breaking the siege of the town, and gaining their first companion, the player character is tasked by the town's garrison leader Gyorn with journeying to the town of Glacern and alerting the Ehb military forces, called the 10th Legion, of the incursion and defeating any forces they encounter along the way. After journeying through crypts, mines, <b>and</b> <b>mountains,</b> the player character reaches Glacern, where they are informed that the Krug invasion happened the same day that the Grand Mage Merik disappeared, and are charged with traveling over the mountains to Fortress Kroth to assist the legion there. In the mountains they find Merik, who informs them that the Krug invasion {{is part of a larger}} invasion by the Seck, who destroyed the Empire of Stars before being imprisoned underneath Castle Ehb, and who have escaped and taken the castle. Merik asks the player to help recover the Staff of Stars from the Goblins. Prior to its theft, the Staff had kept the Seck imprisoned in the Vault of Eternity.|$|E

50|$|Throughout {{the years}} as the Arctic School, Arctic Indoctrination School, and Cold Weather <b>and</b> <b>Mountain</b> School, {{training}} was conducted on an individual basis. Students from reserve component and active Army units throughout the continental United States and Alaska were graduated as instructors in cold weather <b>and</b> <b>mountain</b> operations. However, early in 1963, the Department of the Army concluded that the training in cold weather <b>and</b> <b>mountain</b> operations would be of more beneficial to units than individual training. Therefore, in April 1963, the US Army Cold Weather <b>and</b> <b>Mountain</b> School was redesignated the US Army Northern Warfare Training Center and given the mission of training individuals as well as units {{in the conduct of}} warfare in cold and mountainous regions.|$|R

5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, Argentine airstrikes will {{frequently}} sink Royal Navy ships, depending on how many of them were initially allocated to defensive positions. In addition, Argentine air forces will occasionally bomb and destroy British forces on the ground, which are represented as animated sprites on the map. The map also displays terrain details, including rivers <b>and</b> <b>mountains.</b> If troops are situated on top of a mountain, they will receive a defensive bonus once attacked; however, due to the steep terrain, they will move more slowly. If the player chooses to enter an enemy-controlled zone, the move will instantly end, leaving the unit vulnerable to an Argentine attack.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the landing}} at Saidor, the Japanese elected to retreat rather than fight, and withdrew over {{the foothills of}} the rugged Finisterre Range. For the Japanese {{soldiers}} involved, the march was a nightmare, as they struggled through the jungles, across the swollen rivers, and over cliffs <b>and</b> <b>mountains.</b> Men succumbed to fatigue, disease, starvation, drowning, and even exposure, the nights in the Finisterres being bitterly cold. Hampered by the rugged terrain, inclement weather, signal failures, misunderstandings, over-caution, and above all the resolute and resourceful Japanese, US troops were unable to prevent large numbers of the retreating Japanese from slipping past them.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the rest}} of the {{southern}} Blue Ridge Mountains, the area surrounding the lake consists of many valleys, ridges <b>and</b> <b>mountains</b> formed by repeated plate tectonic movement and collisions, starting with the Grenville Orogeny nearly 1.5 billion years ago. The resulting landscape created diverse topology containing many different species of plants and animal. Much of the area is similar to Pennsylvania in climate, vegetation and wildlife. The lake is near the southern limit for Eastern hemlock and Eastern white pine. Coves in the area vary by elevation and topography, with second-growth oak and hickory more common in lower-lying areas. Forests surrounding the lake contain rich, high-altitude flora including rare wildflowers and ferns, such as Painted Trillium, which grows near Rhododrendron. Boulderfields near Sosebee Cove include Dutchman's breeches, squirrel corn, waterleaf and other herbaceous plants.|$|E

5|$|Malvern {{lies in the}} Lower Severn/Avon plain affording it {{a degree}} of shelter caused {{by virtue of its}} {{nestling}} in between the Cotswold hills to the east, the Welsh Hills <b>and</b> <b>Mountains</b> to the west, and Birmingham plateau to the north. Although as with all the British Isles it has a maritime climate, the local topography means summer warmth can become emphasised by a slight foehn effect off the surrounding hills. The record maximum stands at 35.8c(96.4f) set in August 1990. Typically 17.3 days of the year will reach 25.1c(77.2f) or higher and the annual warmest day should reach 29.8c(85.6f) according to the 1971–00 observing period.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 2004, the Cassini–Huygens {{space probe}} {{performed}} the SOI (Saturn Orbit Insertion) maneuver and entered orbit around Saturn. Before the SOI, Cassini had already studied the system extensively. In June 2004, it had conducted a close flyby of Phoebe, sending back high-resolution images and data. Cassini flyby of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, has captured radar images of large lakes and their coastlines with numerous islands <b>and</b> <b>mountains.</b> The orbiter completed two Titan flybys before releasing the Huygens probe on 25 December 2004. Huygens descended {{onto the surface}} of Titan on 14 January 2005, sending a flood of data during the atmospheric descent and after the landing. Cassini has since conducted multiple flybys of Titan and other icy satellites.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo {{mission was}} twice {{extended}}, in 1997 and 2000. During these extended missions, the probe flew by Io {{three times in}} late 1999 and early 2000 and three times in late 2001 and early 2002. Observations during these encounters revealed the geologic processes occurring at Io's volcanoes <b>and</b> <b>mountains,</b> excluded {{the presence of a}} magnetic field, and demonstrated the extent of volcanic activity. In December 2000, the Cassini spacecraft had a distant and brief encounter with the Jovian system en route to Saturn, allowing for joint observations with Galileo. These observations revealed a new plume at Tvashtar Paterae and provided insights into Io's aurorae.|$|E
