40|$|Abstract: For {{assessment}} of safety, {{it is necessary}} to measure the maximum possible force exerted by a bone conduction device coupled to the human head. Calibration of bone conduc-tion hearing aids and vibrators in the audiometric range is based on measurement of accelera-tion and force using an <b>artificial</b> <b>mastoid.</b> Extending the measurement to the high audio range was accomplished using a live head. To assess safety of the UltraQuiet tinnitus treatment sys-tem, as an example, acceleration was measured from 5 to 20 kHz on a live human head as com-pared with calibrated levels at 6 kHz on an <b>artificial</b> <b>mastoid</b> and the live head. Using head acceleration and anchoring it to established calibration levels is a means of establishing clini-cal safety. Stimulation in the high audio frequencies at low levels was found to be safe. In con-trast, stimulation with ultrasound requires more energy (approximately 75 - 90 dB re 6 kHz), which may increase the risk of damage to the ear.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} is to evaluate the electro-acoustic performance of a new audiometric bone vibrator, the B 81 from Radioear Corporation, USA. Comparison will be made with the widely used B 71 which has well-known limitations at low frequencies. Design: The B 81 {{is based on the}} balanced electromagnetic separation transducer (BEST) principle where static forces are counterbalanced so that nonlinear distortion forces are reduced and maximum hearing levels can be increased. Study sample: Maximum hearing level, total harmonic distortion (THD), frequency response, and electrical impedance were measured for six devices of each bone vibrator type on an <b>artificial</b> <b>mastoid.</b> Results: It was found that B 81 reaches 10. 7 - 22. 0 dB higher maximum (@ THD. 6 % or V-in. 6 V-RMS) hearing levels than B 71 for frequencies below 1500 Hz, and had significantly lower THD up to 1000 Hz. There was no statistically significant difference between their frequency response, except a deviation at the mid frequencies (alpha = 0. 01) where B 81 was more efficient and the electrical impedances were practically the same. Conclusions: In general, B 81 had an improved electro-acoustic performance compared to B 71 and is compatible with same audiometers. In particular, B 81 allows for sensorineural hearing loss to be measured at considerably higher hearing levels than with B 71 below 1500 Hz...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} {{is to determine the}} output force variability of the new bone conduction transducer, called Balanced Electromagnetic Separation Transducer (BEST), and of the conventional transducer from Radioear B 71. The loads used in this study were the mechanical impedance of the skull of thirty test persons and the mechanical impedance of the <b>artificial</b> <b>mastoid</b> (AM) 4930 from Brüel&Kjær. The hypothesis is that the BEST has less variability since it has inherent damping of the spring elements, while the damping with the B 71 is mainly due to to damping in the skin and the soft tissue. Hence, the damping of the B 71 transducer is basically dependent on the patients individual properties. The output force of the transducers were estimated in three different ways: 1. Transducer modelled as a four pole equivalent. 2. Transducer modelled as an impedance analogy lumped parameter model. 3. Direct measurement using the AM (not completed in this study). The models of the transducers were determined from frequency response measurements. As expected the variation of the output force was less for BEST than for B 71. For BEST, the standard deviation of the force is approximately - 3 to + 2 dB at 316 Hz, while for B 71 the deviation at 200 to 500 Hz is up to + 4 to - 10 dB. Both transducers show greater load dependency at higher frequencies. BEST has a standard deviation ranging from + 0. 8 / - 1 dB to + 3 / - 5 dB for the frequencies between 0. 8 and 3 kHz. The B 71 have a standard deviation in output force level of - 6 to + 4 dB from 1. 2 to 10 kHz. The results also show that the output force of the transducers differ less than the mechanical impedances of the test objects. The impedance of the <b>artificial</b> <b>mastoid</b> are very different about 7 dB relative to 1 Ns/m between the mean and AM. Comparing the output forces from the BEST loaded with the two impedances (mean human skull and AM), lower force magnitudes is found for the test objects up to 10 dB for frequencies from 1. 3 to 10 kHz. The B 71 shows also lower force magnitude with the impedance of the test persons than with the impedance of AM at even lower frequencies than the BEST, from 6 to 10 dB for 0. 4 to 10 kHz. Further, in the low frequency range 100 to 400 Hz, the BEST shows approximately 5 dB higher output force levels than the B 71 with the same amount of stimulation. This is true for both types of mechanical impedances, which is an important advantage for the BEST due to the non-linear distortion at low frequencies for B 71. When the output force is calculated with the mean value of the impedances of the subjects, the B 71 gives higher amplitudes than the BEST, about 10 dB, in the frequency region from 1. 3 to 10 kHz. When the force is determined by the impedance of the AM, higher force level of the B 71 starts at 400 Hz becoming equal to that of BEST at 1 kHz to increase again the remaining frequency range. Since the main resonance of the variables Z 21 and Z 12 did not occur at the same frequency it gives some artifacts that should be disregarded. It is of interest to calculate the value of lumped parameters of the transducers and make new calculations of the output force {{to be sure that the}} artifacts vanish...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the validity of}} a bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) Softband (fitted unilaterally and bilaterally) in young children with bilateral congenital aural atresia. SUBJECTS: Two children with severe bilateral congenital conductive hearing loss, who had been fitted with a transcutaneous BAHA Softband {{at the age of}} 3 and 28 months, respectively. The latter child had been fitted with a conventional bone-conduction hearing aid at the age of 3 months; at 28 months, this child had received the BAHA Softband and after 5 months of unilateral application, the BAHA Softband was fitted bilaterally. Follow-up in the two children was 31 and 17 months, respectively. METHODS: Using the <b>artificial</b> <b>mastoid,</b> gain and maximum output were studied in this new transcutaneous application of the BAHA, with the BAHA Classic and the BAHA Compact as sound processor. Results were compared to those obtained with a conventional bone-conduction device (Oticon E 300 P). Aided thresholds and sound lateralization scores were assessed with double visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA). To test the validity of the BAHA Softband, the speech and language development of the children was assessed by means of age-appropriate tests (the preverbal Symbolic play test and the Dutch non-speech test for receptive and expressive language and the Dutch version of the Reynell language test). RESULTS: The electro-acoustic measurements showed minor differences in gain between the three devices. At a reduced volume setting, the mean input level at which the output levelled off was largely comparable between the BAHA Classic and the conventional device, but somewhat poorer with the BAHA Compact. Both children showed speech and language development that was in accordance with their cognitive development. CONCLUSIONS: The BAHA Softband was a valid intervention in children with congenital bilateral aural atresia who were too young for percutaneous BAHA application...|$|E
