The analysis of the experimental data is made by a detailed theoretical study of the steady-state and small-signal electrical characteristics of the structures. Numerical simulations {{are based on the}} solution of the basic semiconductor equations for the structure consisting of two Schottky diodes connected back to back by a conduction channel formed by the GaN layer. The description explicitly includes the Mg-related acceptor level, with its temperature- and position-dependent incomplete occupation state, leading to a dynamic exchange with the valence band. It fully reproduces the variations with temperature of the capacitance [...] frequency and conductance over frequency curves, allowing to give for all temperature ranges the origin of the various contributions to the junction capacitance and of the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the capacitance [...] frequency cutoff. Series resistance effects are shown to be dominant at temperatures above 230 K, whereas the Mg-related acceptor level governs the electrical behavior below 230 K. The existence of a second acceptor level with an <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> of several tens of meV is revealed from the analysis of the characteristics at low temperature.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the high p-type {{conductivity}} in GaN:Mg, grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition followed by post-growth annealing, is due to non-equilibrium acceptor concentrations. A series of samples cut from a single GaN:Mg wafer, which initially had undergone rapid thermal annealing (RTA) after growth, has been investigated. The samples were annealed at various temperatures in nitrogen ambient for over 12 hours, and temperature-dependent Hall effect measurements were performed. For samples annealed at temperatures higher than 850 °C, the hole concentrations decrease by at least an order of magnitude, compared with the original sample. This behavior is explained by an Mg acceptor concentration in excess of its equilibrium solubility limit in the original sample; thus, at high enough temperatures, {{in the absence of}} hydrogen, Mg acceptors diffuse either to form electrically inactive precipitates or are eliminated.

In particular, the growth and characterization of AlGaN alloys are discussed in detail. It was shown that AlGaN could be made n-type for x up to 1 (pure AlN). Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) studies carried out on these materials have shown that Si-doping reduces the effect of carrier localization in AlxGa 1 −xN alloys and a sharp drop in carrier localization energy occurs when the Si doping concentration increases above 1 × 1018 cm− 3, which directly correlates with the observed electrical properties.

Chemical doping yielded a severe inhomogeneity in a statistical distribution of involved charged impurities. Two approaches are adopted {{to treat the}} inhomogeneity effects; Monte Carlo simulation technique for the n-doped films, and the fluctuation theory for the p-ZnO. The broadening of PL band of n-ZnO was significantly larger than predicted by theoretical results in which the linewidths of each individual emissions have been determined mainly from the concentration fluctuation of donor-type dopants by the simulation. Moreover, the rather asymmetrical line shape was observed. To explain these features, a vibronic model was developed accounting for contributions {{from a series of}} phonon replicas. In case of p-type ZnO:N, analysis of excitation-intensity dependence of the peak shift of donor-acceptor luminescence with a fluctuation model has also proven the importance of the inhomogeneity effect of charged impurity distribution, {{as in the case of}} ZnO:Ga.

Recently, our group has achieved highly conductive n-type AlxGal-xN for x as high as 0. 7 (a resistivity value as low as 0. 15 ohm-cm has been achieved). Prior to this, only insulating AlxGal-xN (x> 0. 5) can be obtained. Our success is largely attributed to our unique capability for monitoring the optical qualities of these layers-the development of the world's first (and presently only) deep UV picosecond time-resolved optical spectroscopy system for probing the optical properties of Ill-nitrides [photoluminescence (PL), electro-luminescence (EL), etc. ] with a time-resolution of a few ps and wavelength down to deep UV (down to 195 nm) [1 1].

Photocurrent absorption spectra, of 35 A Ino. 1 Gao. 9 N QW LEDs, were measured for a range of reverse bias. A bias of 8. 5 V was necessary to counteract the affect of the internal piezoelectric field. Using this value and an appropriate approximation for the depletion width of a p-z'-n junction the calculated piezoelectric field was (1. 9 0. 15) MVcm" 1, in good agreement with 1. 8 MVcm" 1 calculated using piezoelectric constants interpolated from the binaries. The absorption spectra of 26 A wide Ino. i 6 Gao. 84 N QW LEDs exhibit a band tail extending to low photon energies whereas emission occurs from the low energy side of this band tail, suggesting emission occurs from localised potential minima. Light-current (LI) characteristics, measured as a function of temperature, are sublinear and exhibit a distinctive temperature dependence.

The realization of ZnO ¬p-n homojunction devices requires to fabricate stable p-type material with a hole concentration in the 1017 - 1018 cm- 3 range. This thesis addresses the relationships between the microstructure and the optoelectronic properties of acceptor-doped ZnO films fabricated by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The acceptor dopants studied are nitrogen and phosphorus. The effects of doping, substrate and processing conditions on the film optoelectronic properties are investigated. ZnO epilayers doped uniformly with 1020 nitrogen at. /cm 3 can be fabricated by ablation of a Zn-rich Zn 3 N 2 target in O 2 atmosphere. When the growth temperature exceeds 300 °C, the nitrogen solubility falls rapidly. Films deposited at 300 °C and heat-treated in O 2 are p-type with p~ 1017 cm- 3. The moderate level of hole conduction is explained by the kinetics of PLD. Two doping-induced acceptor levels at 105 meV and 280 meV are identified. The effect of nitrogen doping on the film microstructure is studied. Heavy doping with phosphorus (1020 at. /cm 3) is necessary to achieve p-type conductivity with p~ 1017 cm- 3. The dominant crystal defects are interstitial dislocation loops and partial dislocations (1011 - 1013 cm- 2). These defects {{play a key role in}} the formation of shallow acceptors. Their interaction with phosphorus is discussed and a formation mechanism for the PZn- 2 VZn acceptor complex is proposed.

Indium-nitrogen codoped zinc oxide (INZO) thin films were fabricated by spray pyrolysis deposition technique on n-(111) Si substrate with different film thicknesses at 450 ∘C using a precursor containing zinc acetate, ammonium acetate, and indium nitrate with 1 : 3 : 0. 05 at. % concentration. Themorphology and structure {{studies were carried out}} by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The grain size of the films increased when increasing the film thickness. From XRD spectra, polycrystalline ZnO structure can be observed and the preferred orientation behavior varied from (002) to (101) as the film thickness increased. The concentration and mobility were investigated by Hall effect measurement. the p-type films with a hole mobility around 3 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1 and hole concentration around 3 × 1019 cm− 3 can be achieved with film thickness less than 385 nm.

40|$|The {{catalytic}} cycle of numerous enzymes involves the coupling between proton transfer and electron transfer. Yet, {{the understanding of}} this coordinated transfer in biological systems remains limited, likely because its characterization relies on the controlled but experimentally challenging modifications of the free energy changes associated with either the electron or proton transfer. We have performed such a study here in Photosystem II. The driving force for electron transfer from TyrZ to P 680 •+ has been decreased by ∼ 80 meV by mutating the axial ligand of P 680, and that for proton transfer upon oxidation of TyrZ by substituting a 3 -fluorotyrosine (3 F-TyrZ) for TyrZ. In Mn-depleted Photosystem II, the dependence upon pH of the oxidation rates of TyrZ and 3 F-TyrZ {{were found to be}} similar. However, in the pH range where the phenolic hydroxyl of TyrZ is involved in a H-bond with a proton <b>acceptor,</b> the <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> of the oxidation of 3 F-TyrZ is decreased by 110 meV, a value which correlates with the in vitro finding of a 90 meV stabilization energy to the phenolate form of 3 F-Tyr when compared to Tyr (Seyedsayamdost et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 1569 - 1579). Thus, when the phenol of YZ acts as a H-bond donor, its oxidation by P 680 •+ is controlled by its prior deprotonation. This contrasts with the situation prevailing at lower pH, where the proton acceptor is protonated and therefore unavailable, in which the oxidation-induced proton transfer from the phenolic hydroxyl of TyrZ has been proposed to occur concertedly with the electron transfer to P 680 •+. This suggests a switch between a concerted proton/electron transfer at pHs 3 ̆c 7. 5 to a sequential one at pHs 3 ̆e 7. 5 and illustrates the roles of the H-bond and of the likely salt-bridge existing between the phenolate and the nearby proton acceptor in determining the coupling between proton and electron transfer...|$|R

40|$|When the {{equilibrium}} state of a reaction {{depends on the}} temperature, isoconversion methods for calculating <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> are no longer valid. In these cases (apparent) <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> obtained from isoconversion methods vary with temperature and fraction transformed, even if the true <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> of the thermally activated process is constant.

40|$|The present {{quarterly}} report describes {{some of the}} investigations on the structural properties of dense OTM bars provided by Praxair and studies on newer composition of Ti doped LSF. In the current research, the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient were measured {{as a function of}} temperature in air. Based on these measurements, the charge carrier concentration, net <b>acceptor</b> dopant concentration, <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> of conduction and mobility were estimated. The studies on the fracture toughness of the LSFT and dual phase membranes at room temperature have been completed and reported previously. The membranes that are exposed to high temperatures at an inert and a reactive atmosphere undergo many structural and chemical changes which affects the mechanical properties. To study the effect of temperature on the membranes when exposed to an inert environment, the membranes (LAFT and Dual phase) were heat treated at 1000 C in air and N{sub 2 } atmosphere and hardness and fracture toughness of the membranes were studied after the treatment. The indentation method was used to find the fracture toughness and the effect of the heat treatment on the mechanical properties of the membranes. Further results on the investigation of the origin of the slow kinetics on reduction of ferrites have been obtained. The slow kinetics appears to be related to a non-equilibrium reduction pathway that initially results in the formation of iron particles. At long times, equilibrium can be reestablished with recovery of the perovskite phase. 2 -D modeling of oxygen movement has been undertaken in order to fit isotope data. The model will serve to study ''frozen'' profiles in patterned or composite membranes...|$|R
