40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} study on millimetre-size electrochemically evolved hydrogen bubbles. A method to generate gas bubbles controlled in number, size at detachment <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> flat electrode is reported. Partially wetted composite islands are implemented on a polished metal substrate. As {{long as the}} island size is lower than a limit depending on its wettability, only one bubble spreads {{on the island and}} its size at detachment is controlled by the island perimeter. The composite, a metal-polytetrafluoroethylene (Ni-PTFE), is obtained by an electrochemical co-deposition process. On the contrary to predictions of available models for co-deposition, at current densities beyond Ni 2 + limiting current density, the mass ratio of PTFE in the deposit strongly increases. A mechanism is proposed to describe co-deposition when hydrogen bubbles are co-evolved. The observation of gas evolution on fully hydrophobic electrodes highlights the fact that bubbles growth rate on such electrodes differs from growth rates when bubble growth is controlled by mass transport of dissolved gas. The more a bubble grows by coalescence the more its foot expands on the electrode the bigger its size at detachment. This triple line creeping mechanism explains why, when attached bubbles coalesce many times before detaching, their size at detachment increases with current density...|$|E

However, larval hatch and development will continue for some weeks to come – the rootworm emergence is a long and gradual curve, not a sharp spike like some insect populations. Initially, larvae are seldom observed because they are very small and live mostly within the roots.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to explore}} the possibilities of architecture as a sensory phenomenon and to explore how we can experience architectural space through all our senses, and how architecture can influence how we experience our senses in space. The project is located within the cultural node identified within the Nelson Mandela Development Corridor (MDC) and the proposed building {{is one of a}} cultural centre for the visual and performing arts. The centre is aimed at creating a heightened awareness and insight into the creative processes of artists and performers for the general public, community, users and occupants of the centre and passers-by. This will be achieved through the creation of visual connections and physical interactions between the users, artists and performers and passers by as well has creating a heightened experience of space <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> human scale for visitors, performers, artists and general public. The centre also incorporates retail, commercial and residential components in order to energise the square and centre throughout the day and night, creating an active 24 hour environment, which is often lacking in a development of this nature. The activities of the centre, along with those of the existing Oeverzicht houses and old M. O. T. H. club, that have been incorporated into the development spill out onto a central urban activity square, where impromptu and planned performances are to be staged. The aim of the development is ultimately to develop a synthesis between arts, culture, economy and urban vitality by creating a platform for the arts. The aim of this dissertation is to explore the ability of spaces inside this building typology to assist in inspiring each of its occupants through the creation of memorable spatial experiences.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to write a Superwylbur macro, called D 50 TD 80, for the Computing Information center at Northern Illinois University. The project was {{completed}} using Superwylbur, an interactive computing environment which enables access to the University’s mainframe computer. Superwylbur macro programming combines Superwylbur commands along {{with a set of}} special instructions for branching and decision making. The D 50 TD 80 macro was designed to assist users in moving data sets from the current 3350 disk packs to the newly installed, more efficient 3380 disk packs. This macro allows the user three options: 1) To create a partitioned data set from sequential data sets, <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 3380 disk pack, 2) To move an entire partitioned data set to a 3380 disk pack, and 3) To move a sequential data set to a 3380 disk pack. Options 2 and 3 are executed by calling modified versions of existing macros. Changes to these macros included additional error checking and more informative prompts. The first option begins by asking the user for the name and location of the partitioned data set that they wish to create. The user is next prompted for the names of the sequential data sets to be saved as members of the partitioned data set. The requested data sets are then placed into the specified PDS. The macro was coded to be user friendly by anticipating a variety of user errors, and making the prompts and error messages friendly, yet informative. The method followed to complete the end product was basically a “hands on” approach. Using The Superwylbur Macro Programming Manual as a primary reference, a simple macro was written which can assist a user in uploading and downloading files from Superwylbur. After some practice with the language, the D 50 TD 80 macro was coded. This macro will be available for public use in the Spring of 1989. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|E
40|$|Survival {{is bound}} to {{conditions}} of safety (now) and preservation (future). The places that marginal people inhabit are either permanent familiar places, or temporary unfamiliar places. These places however are also bound to time. When circumstances are unpredictable survival instincts are heightened, and when circumstances are predictable survival instincts are at a neutral level (or in {{in a state of}} homeostasis). If a place is undergoing change such as societal and political change, the change in mental state of a person occurs as this affects the survival of that person. The dissertation explores ideas of identity (valued, strong, useful), perception (how other people see the marginal) and marginalisation of specific groups of people. This will be investigated in terms of the preservation of the marginalised people through programmatic devices and activities (what can the marginal offer). The proposed programme (and supporting programmes) allow for the development of marginalised people in a hostile society in which survival and refuge are the first instincts. The intent of the architecture seeks to explore the relationship between a marginal person <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> conceptual and physical level. Moreover the architecture seeks to negotiate the margins that society has placed between those who are approved within society (the norm) and those who are different than the norm. A consciousness of this difference or 'margin area' exists throughout the investigation which allows for an alternative approach to create thought-provoking architecture rather than an aesthetically pleasing architecture. It is the belief of the author that even though something might be 'broken', it remains more useful and is more valuable than something that was perfect in the first place. The project moves beyond monotony and strives for unity in difference (the marginal unite). Difference as a strength creates an opportunity to emphasise those who are different and finds a way to strengthen the alternative identities in a future spatial condition. The proposed programme facilitates the development of these identities to become stronger in time in order to withstand struggle and unpredictability.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Phosphate esters {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in any organism. Nucleic acids, metabolic intermediates like glucose- 6 -phosphate, energy-rich substrates (AMP, creatine phosphate) are some obvious examples. While many metabolic intermediates are activated through {{the transfer of}} phosphate groups (e. g., by kinases) it is equally important that phosphate esters can also be rapidly broken down. The hydrolytic removal of phosphate groups from phosphoesters is catalyzed by phosphatases. Many phosphatases are highly substrate-specific, like those enzymes involved in signal transduction. A number of phosphatases, however, cleave virtually any phosphate ester. Such unspecific enzymes function mainly in the catabolic breakdown of metabolites or nutrients. Depending on the pH at which such phosphatases have optimal activity, we distinguish between acidic phosphatases (also called acid phosphatases) and alkaline phosphatases. The latter enzymes require divalent metal ions as cofactors and are common in animal tissues and bacteria. Acidic phosphatases are widely distributed in many organisms, including plants. They work optimally at ~ pH 5 without additional cofactors. The enzymes are classified as E. C. 3. 1. 3. 2. In this experiment, we will extract an acidic phosphatase from seedlings of mustard (Sinapis alba) and partially purifiy the enzyme by ammonium sulfate precipiation. Most important prerequisite for any enzyme isolation is an activity test. For this phosphatase, we {{take advantage of the}} broad substrate specificity and use an artificial substrate that changes its color after hydrolytic removal of the phosphate group: ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") Since the phosphatase is active only at acidic pH values, but p-nitrophenol is colored at basic pH values, we must change the pH following the enzyme reaction. We will incubate for 30 min at pH 4. 8, and then stop the reaction by adding NaOH. ### EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL **Week 1 - Day 1 ** You are provided with a flat of 5 - 8 days old mustard seedlings grown in the dark in a bed of vermiculite. ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") 1. Remove the 5 - 10 cm long seedlings from the vermiculite, wash and pat dry on paper towel. Weigh and record the weight. (use 25 - 50 g). ![Figure 3]([URL] "Figure 3 ") 2. Grind in a mortar with 75 ml of ice-cold water. 3. Make the volume up to 150 ml and transfer the slurry into the Polytron homogenizer. Homogenize 1 min at speed 5 (3 x 20 sec). 4. Filter the homogenate through 8 layers of cheese cloth into a cold beaker on ice. Remove 1 ml aliquot to an Eppendorf microfuge tube, and label as HOM and leave on ice. 5. Transfer the extract into one 250 ml centrifuge bottle. Balance against water or, if ready, against the extract of the other group. Always keep the extract on ice. 6. Centrifuge in the Sorvall superspeed centrifuge (B 7202) in GSA rotor (r = 12. 5 cm) at 9500 rpm (1, 000 x g) for 30 min. 7. Decant the supernatant (SN 1) (contains many organelles and the cytosol) into a graduated cylinder and note the volume. Remove 1 ml aliquot to an Eppendorf microfuge tube, and label as SN 1 and leave on ice. This will be used for subsequent protein and activity determination. Later freeze at - 20 °C. Resuspend the pellet which contains the cell debris and nuclei in 10 ml water, and take a 1 ml sample labeled P 1. Discard the remaining pellet. 8. Weigh the amount of solid (NH 4) 2 SO 4 required (0. 25 g/ml of solution SN 1). Record this amount. Leave the supernatant in a 250 ml beaker on ice bath <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> magnetic stirrer. 9. Insert a clean stirring bar and using a spatula add small amounts of (NH 4) 2 SO 4 while stirring. This yields a [40 % saturated solution]([URL] which precipitates some proteins, but not the phosphatase. 10. Precipitate these proteins after 1 h by centrifugation in 50 ml centrifuge tube (approx. 35 ml per tube) at 31, 000 x g ([estimate the rpm]([URL] value using the rotor radius) for 30 min in the Hermle centrifuge at 4 °C (room B 8220). 11. Decant the supernatant (SN 2) into a grad. cylinder and note the volume. Remove 1 ml aliquot to an Eppendorf microfuge tube, label as SN 2 and leave on ice. Resuspend the pellet in 2 - 3 ml of ice cold water. Label as P 2 and freeze at - 20 °C. 12. To the supernatant, add another 0. 25 g (NH 4) 2 SO 4 /ml of the original volume of SN 1 while stirring slowly. The solution is now [70 % saturated]([URL] This should be stirred at least for 1 hour or you can leave this in the cold room while stirring overnight. **Day 2 ** 13. The next morning, transfer the suspension to a 50 ml centrifuge tube and spin for 30 min at the speed as in step 9. 14. Decant the supernatant (SN 3) and leave an aliquot (1 ml) in a microfuge tube. Resuspend the pellet in 5 ml of cold distilled water. Most of the phosphatase activity should be contained in this pellet. Take an aliquot (0. 5 ml) labeled P 3. 15. Divide among 4 microfuge tubes and remove insoluble proteins by spinning in the microfuge at full speed for 2 min. 16. Carefully transfer the supernatant into four eppendorf tubes. Label as SN 4. 17. Leave all the aliquots in a beaker with your initials on it in the - 20 °C freezer. You will use these fractions for further analysis ([see flow scheme]([URL] ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") All fractions will be subjected to a [protein]([URL] and [enzyme assay]([URL]...|$|E
