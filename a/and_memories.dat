5|$|Father (1966) is {{a coming}} of age story that {{displays}} Szabó’s increasing fascination with history and memory. The main character copes with the childhood loss of his father {{against the backdrop of}} the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 <b>and</b> <b>memories</b> of the Arrow Cross dictatorship. The film won the Grand Prix at the 5th Moscow International Film Festival and the Special Jury Prize at Locarno, and established Szabó as the most internationally famous Hungarian filmmaker of his time, as well as an auteur in the European film tradition. In 2000, Father appeared as number 11 on a list of the 12 best Hungarian films according to a group of Hungarian film critics.|$|E
40|$|There is {{substantial}} variation in perception <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> in humans. There are individuals who cannot see red at all, {{and there are}} individuals who hear colors and taste words. What determines the differences and similarities between individuals' perception <b>and</b> <b>memory?</b> Can we characterize the neural and genetic bases {{as well as the}} environmental causes of variation in perception <b>and</b> <b>memory?</b> This thesis aimed to explore the range of variation in perception <b>and</b> <b>memory,</b> the neural basis of this variation and whether training can alter perception <b>and</b> <b>memory,</b> focusing on visual perception <b>and</b> <b>memory.</b> The overall conclusion from the research presented in this thesis is that individual differences in both visual perception <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> ability are reflected in brain function and structure in related networks to a certain degree. In addition, the results suggested that perceptual training paradigms have behavioral benefits and genes can influence the effect of perceptual training on brain function. To what extent differences in perception <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> abilities can be reliably predicted from brain function and structure at the individual level remains an open question for future research...|$|R

His time of 19.96s was his second fastest that year and fourth fastest of any sprinter that season. Although he stated that the quality of the competition <b>and</b> <b>memories</b> of Helsinki had made him nervous beforehand, he went on to beat all three American sprinters he had lost to in the World Championships, becoming the first athlete to beat Gatlin over 200m that season. It was not only his rival sprinters that would cause future difficulties, however, as Gay's coach Brauman was indicted for various crimes relating to his time at Barton College and the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. He had helped athletes gain funds and credits that they were not entitled to. Following Gay's testimony, the courts ruled that Brauman was guilty and, as a result, Arkansas' two NCAA titles and all of Gay's college track times were annulled. None of the athletes were charged with any wrongdoing. Although he was imprisoned for 10 months, Brauman continued to train Gay, periodically updating him with coaching routines and techniques.|$|E

As Cassandra uses a voodoo doll on Masha, trying to dissuade {{thoughts}} of selling the house, Sonia receives {{a phone call from a}} man she met at the party, requesting a date. Hesitantly, she accepts. Vanya, who is secretly writing a play inspired by Konstantin's imagined symbolist drama in The Seagull, is convinced by Nina to let her read it in front of the others. During the reading (which stars Nina as a molecule and takes place after the destruction of the earth), Spike rudely answers a text on his phone, and dismisses Vanya's suggestion of a handwritten response. Vanya reacts by launching into an impassioned rant, criticizing America's cultural regression in communication and media, while fondly and wistfully recalling the surroundings <b>and</b> <b>memories</b> of his childhood. Concluding that the intent of such progress seems to make people like him feel lost and forgotten, he retreats into the kitchen in tears.|$|E
40|$|Children with {{epilepsy}} risk numerous {{problems at}} school, including {{those related to}} attention <b>and</b> <b>memory.</b> Crucially, attention <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> are central to academic success. Consequently, {{it can be argued}} that school psychologists should conduct comprehensive evaluations that intentionally measure attention <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> when assessing children with epilepsy. The sparse existing research, however, suggests that school psychologists often leave these important domains unassessed. Even less known is why attention <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> might be left unassessed, although school psychologists' limited awareness of epilepsy's threat to specific cognitive processes and/or doubt that attention <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> tests are indeed feasible to use in school settings are candidate explanations. This study concerns school psychologists and their assessment practices for students with epilepsy. It investigates whether unawareness of epilepsy's risk to attention <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> and/or doubt about the feasibility of school-based attention <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> tests may be partial explanations of their restrictive practices. Each of 237 participating school psychologists read about a hypothetical student with epilepsy and was randomly assigned to one of four conditions: neutral information (control); information about the feasibility of attention <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> tests (Feasibility information only); information about risk for attention <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> problems in children with epilepsy (Risk information only); or information about both feasibility and risk (Risk + Feasibility information). Participants were then provided with a list of standardized assessments (i. e., cognitive, academic, social-emotional, attention, <b>and</b> <b>memory)</b> <b>and</b> other (non-psychometric) techniques and practices (i. e., formal behavioral observation, pediatrician contact, interviews) for potential use. Subsequently, participants rated their attitudes (perceived value and likelihood of use) and ranked the importance of each assessment/practice regarding the hypothetical student with epilepsy. There were four predictions: 1) school psychologists in the control condition will endorse the least favorable attitudes and importance rankings of attention <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> tests; 2) school psychologists' provided with information about either Risk or Feasibility will have higher attitude ratings and importance rankings of these tests than those in the control condition; 3) those provided with both Risk and Feasibility information will have the highest attitude ratings and highest importance rankings of attention <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> tests. Findings suggest that Risk information alone was associated with higher attitude ratings and importance rankings of attention <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> tests, <b>and</b> that Feasibility information had no effect on school psychologists' attitude ratings or importance ranking of these assessment tools. Study limitations, implications for practice, and future directions for research are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a bus <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> {{architectures}} co-synthesis technique.

As a main contribution, bus <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> architectures are optimized simultaneously by allocating different amount of slacks to them during co-synthesis. The method finds a balance of slack allocation for both bus <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> optimization. While the previous co-synthesis approaches do not consider the slack allocation technique, the synthesized bus <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> architectures will not be optimal in terms of area and energy consumption. The experimental results carried out on real-life applications show 19 % and 24 % reduction in bus <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> area, respectively <b>and</b> 37 % reduction in energy overhead due to a bridge in compared to the previous co-synthesis approach. ...|$|R

40|$|Cognitive deficits are a {{significant}} clinical problem associated with HIV infection. Although the role of CCR 5 in immunity and in HIV infection has been studied widely, its role in neuronal plasticity, learning <b>and</b> <b>memory,</b> <b>and</b> in HIV-associated cognitive deficits is not well understood. In a reverse genetic screen, we found that a Ccr 5 null mutation results in hippocampus-dependent <b>memory</b> enhancements. Molecular <b>and</b> cellular studies indicated that the memory enhancement is caused by increases in MAPK/CREB signaling and enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP). Ccr 5 knockdown in the hippocampus of adult mice also led to enhancements in hippocampal memory, thus confirming a role for this receptor in adult plasticity <b>and</b> <b>memory.</b> These results suggest that besides {{its role as a}} co-receptor for HIV, CCR 5 is a powerful suppressor for learning <b>and</b> <b>memory,</b> <b>and</b> that CCR 5 over-activation by viral peptides may contribute to HIV-associated cognitive deficits. Consistent with this hypothesis, the HIV V 3 loop peptide, known to bind and activate CCR 5, caused deficits both in signaling implicated in learning <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> (hippocampal MAPK activation) and in a key cellular mechanism for learning <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> (LTP). Accordingly, acute hippocampal injection of V 3 peptide also caused memory deficits. Importantly, V 3 peptide induced signaling, LTP <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> deficits were prevented by a Ccr 5 knockout. Overall, our results demonstrate that CCR 5 {{plays an important role in}} plasticity <b>and</b> <b>memory,</b> <b>and</b> CCR 5 over-activation may contribute to the cognitive deficits caused by HIV coat proteins...|$|R
