The main aims were to experiment an electronic incident rep o rting sheet and the relative computerised procedure for data e n t ry and analysis with the aim of developing an incident rep o rting system. The Australian Incident Monitoring System (AIMS) was designed to obtain information about the event, the context and concomitant causes. We observed 58 anonymous incident reports over a six-month period. The main incidents include issues relating to the management of medication, the <b>a</b> <b>i</b> rways, <b>catheters</b> and equipment. Most incidents had modest consequences or led to temporary disability and they often caused longer hospitalisation or further treatment and investigations. Communication problems, inadequate superv i s i o n, poor teamwork and difficulties in applying procedures and protocols were the contributory factors most frequently identified as the concomitant causes of the incidents. The report sheet and experience as a whole were evaluated favourably by the operators involved. This reporting system does not provide the real frequency of the adverse events, but it does provide useful information for improving patient safety...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOur working {{hypothesis}} is that constant inter-pulse interval (IPI) electrical stimulation (ES) would resonate with endogenous epileptogenic reverberating circuits, favoring seizure, while random inter-interval ES protocol would promote desynchronization of such neural networks, interfering with the abnormal recruitment of neural structures. Male Wistar rats were stereotaxically implanted with a monopolar ES carbon-fiber electrode (minimizing fMRI artifact) in the amygdala. A 7 T fMRI scanner {{was used to evaluate}} brain activity during ES, fixed four pulses per second ratio, using either a periodic IPI (ES-P) or random IPI (non-periodic ES-NP) stimulation paradigm. Appropriate imaging protocols were used to compare baseline BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) MRI with scans during ES. A second series of experiments, both without stimuli and under the same ES paradigms, were evaluated during continuous infusion of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 4 mg/ml/min) through <b>an</b> <b>i.</b> v. <b>catheter.</b> Our results show that temporal lobe activation during ES-P or ES-NP did not present any statistical differences during ES. However, during PTZ infusion, PTZ-P facilitated recruitment of the temporal lobe ipsilateral to ES while PTZ-NP showed significantly less activation ipsilateral to ES and, in turn, less inter-hemispheric differences. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis of reverberating circuits being synchronized by ES-P and desynchronized by ES-NP. Time-coded low frequency stimulation may be an interesting alternative treatment for patients with refractory epilepsy...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to test a {{constant}} blood withdrawal method (CBWM) to collect blood samples from horses during treadmill exercise. CBWM was performed in 4 Standardbreds and 5 Haflinger horses. A peristaltic pump was used to control blood aspiration from <b>an</b> <b>i.</b> v. <b>catheter</b> via <b>an</b> extension line. Blood was collected using an automatic fractions collector, with a constant delay time between the drawing of blood and sample collection. Blood withdrawal using CBWM was made during a treadmill standardised exercise test (SET). A blood flow of 12 ml/min was used and samples collected every 60 s during the entire period of exercise. The volume of blood collected in each sample tube was 12. 1 ± 0. 2 ml, with a delay time of mean ± s. d. 25. 3 ± 0. 8 s. Plasma lactate kinetics based on measurement of lactate in each fraction showed an exponential increase during the first 13 min of exercise (10. 5 min of SET and 2. 5 min recovery). The peak plasma lactate concentration was observed between 2. 5 and 5. 5 min after the end of SET. CBWM permits the kinetics of lactate and other blood-borne variables to be studied over time.

40|$|Background: Platelet {{dysfunction}} is {{a well-established}} disturbance in haemodialysis (HD) patients. Propyl gallate is a synthetic platelet activator with {{the property to}} stimulate platelet aggregation. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the influence of a single haemodialysis session on propyl gallate-induced platelet aggregation. Methods: Thirty-nine HD patients were enrolled in the study and 20 healthy volunteers were studied as controls. Cellulose diacetate (CD) dialysers were used in 20 patients and polysulphone dialysers in 19. HD was performed via an A-V fistula in 27 patients and via <b>an</b> <b>i.</b> v. <b>catheter</b> in 12. Erythropoietin was administered in 37 patients (epoietin-alpha in 24 and darbepoietin in 13). Thirty-four were receiving the low-molecular-weight heparin tinzaparin. Propyl gallate slide aggregometry was used for evaluating platelet aggregation. Results: In HD patients, platelet aggregation was impaired before as well as after the HD session. No effect of the HD procedure, type of vascular access, adequacy of HD or type of erythropoietin on the propyl gallate-induced platelet aggregation was detected. Platelet aggregation was higher when CD dialyser was used. A negative correlation between the time needed for platelet aggregation to occur and tinzaparin dose was found. Conclusion: Propyl gallate-induced platelet aggregation in HD patients is impaired. Platelet aggregation was higher in patients dialysed with CD membrane than in those dialysed with polysulphone membrane. The higher the dose of tinzaparin, the higher the platelet aggregation. The clinical significance of the above results needs further evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Digital venous {{angiography}} (DVA), a new radiographic technique, was prospectively {{compared to}} conventional intra-arterial angiography (CA) {{in a group}} of 153 patients with trauma and suspected peripheral arterial injury (PAI). Criteria for entry included: large hematoma, proximity to a major vessel, shotgun wounds, blunt injury of the extremities, and fractures or dislocations of areas with high risk of arterial injury. Patients with unequivocal clinical evidence of PAI were excluded. Study patients had both DVA and CA. Sixteen injuries were diagnosed: lacerations (9), transection (1), AV fistulae (2), thromboses (2) and minute intimal flaps (2). All patients with abnormal studies were surgically explored; there were no false-positives. There were no known false-negatives with CA. The intimal flaps were not recognized initially on DVA and their clinical significance is questioned. DVA, compared to CA in PAI, had decreased patient discomfort, cost, and morbidity.

40|$|Abstract. During {{coronary}} artery angiography, a catheter {{is used to}} inject a contrast dye into the coronary arteries. Due to the anatomical variation of the aorta and the coronary arteries in different humans, one common catheter cannot be used for all patients. The cardiologists test different <b>catheters</b> <b>for</b> a patient and select the best one according to the patient’s anatomy. To overcome these problems, we propose a computer-aided catheter selection procedure. In this paper we present our approach for patient specific optimal <b>catheter</b> selection <b>for</b> the angiography of the left {{coronary artery}} (LCA). It involves segmentation of the aorta and coronary arteries, finding the centerline and computing some geometric parameters. These parameters include curve angle of the LCA, LCA contralateral wall curve length, and the aorta cavity length. We then consider <b>catheters</b> <b>for</b> the LCA and compute the angles and lengths of the two curves {{as well as the}} distance between these curves. We suggest a catheter that is the closest one with respect to the patient’s arteries geometry. This solution avoids testing of many catheters during catheterization. The cardiologist already gets a recommendation about the optimal <b>catheter</b> <b>for</b> the patient prior to the intervention. ...|$|R

40|$|The use of balloon-tipped <b>catheters</b> <b>for</b> the {{treatment}} of cardiac malformations was initiated by Rashkind and Miller, {{with the introduction of}} the atrial septostomy catheter in 1966 (1).

Since its introduction balloon atrial septostomy continues to be of major importance for the non-surgical creation of an atrial septal defect in neonates with inadequate mixing of pulmonary and systemic venous blood at atrial leveL The use of <b>catheters</b> <b>for</b> dilatation of peripheral artery stenosis was reported previously by Dotter and Judkins in 1964 (2).
