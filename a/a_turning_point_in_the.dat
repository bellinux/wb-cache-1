5|$|Changes in the line-up of the band, due {{not only}} to its musical {{direction}} but also to external events, mark this album as <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> band's history. 1969 was a prolific year for Fairport Convention; from What We Did on Our Holidays to Liege & Lief within twelve months represented a major development.|$|E

New York, who had trouble {{mounting}} drives to that point, {{then had a}} 95-yard drive which culminated in a touchdown, making the score 14–10.

5|$|The {{actions were}} among few air-to-air {{battles in the}} early phase of the war as the North Koreans, realizing their {{aircraft}} were outmatched, quickly stopped using them aggressively against the UN. The battle also signaled <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Jet age, as new, jet engine powered fighter aircraft had easily bested conventional fighters.|$|E
5|$|The album {{represented}} <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> musical maturation of the band, after {{a turbulent}} period of personnel changes {{in which it}} shrank from a six-man ensemble to a quartet. Working with the Furs for the first time, Todd Rundgren placed his own sonic imprint upon the album as producer and guest musician. Rundgren also added new types of instrumentation to the band's sound, including cello and marimba.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{resulted}} in a major Wallachian victory and disaster for Charles Robert, becoming <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> politics of Hungary, which had to abandon its hopes of extending the kingdom to the Black Sea.

5|$|After Midway and the {{exhausting}} attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign, Japan's capacity to replace its losses in materiel (particularly aircraft carriers) and men (especially well-trained pilots and maintenance crewmen) rapidly became insufficient {{to cope with}} mounting casualties, while the United States' massive industrial and training capabilities made losses far easier to replace. The Battle of Midway, along with the Guadalcanal Campaign, is widely considered <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|Although the Japanese {{continued}} {{to try to}} secure more territory, and the U.S. did not move from a state of naval parity to one of supremacy until after several more months of hard combat, Midway allowed the Allies to switch to the strategic initiative, {{paving the way for}} the landings on Guadalcanal and the prolonged attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign. Midway allowed this to occur before the first of the new Essex-class fleet carriers became available at the end of 1942. The Guadalcanal Campaign is also regarded by some as <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|Following Thermopylae, the Persian {{army had}} {{proceeded}} to burn and sack the Boeotian cities {{which had not}} surrendered, Plataea and Thespiae, before taking possession of the now-evacuated city of Athens. The allied army, meanwhile, prepared to defend the Isthmus of Corinth. Xerxes wished for a final crushing defeat of the Allies to finish the conquest of Greece in that campaigning season; conversely the allies sought a decisive victory over the Persian navy that would guarantee {{the security of the}} Peloponnese. The ensuing naval Battle of Salamis ended in a decisive victory for the Allies, marking <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conflict.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Dunstan became {{well known for}} his {{campaign}} {{against the death penalty}} being imposed on Max Stuart, who was convicted of rape and murder of a small girl. He harried Playford aggressively over the matter, creating an uproar over what he saw as an unfair process. Playford eventually relented, and appeared shaken thereafter; the event was seen as <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> LCL's decline, and Labor gained momentum. During Labor's time in opposition, Dunstan was prominent in securing some reforms in Aboriginal rights, and was at the forefront of Labor abandoning the White Australia Policy.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opposition}} to the German occupiers was heavily repressed. Displays of patriotism, such as singing the national anthem, La Brabançonne, or celebrating Belgian National Day were banned and those breaking the rules risked strict prison sentences. Newspapers, books and mail were all tightly censored and regulated. Numerous high-profile Belgian figures, including Adolphe Max, the mayor of Brussels, and the historian Henri Pirenne, were imprisoned in Germany as hostages. The aftermath of the Battle of Verdun in 1916 marked <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> occupation and was followed by more repressive measures by the administration, including the deportation of workers to Germany.|$|E
5|$|Terang Boelan was a {{commercial}} success {{in both the}} Indies and abroad, earning 200,000 Straits dollars in British Malaya. This success revived the faltering domestic film industry and inspired films aimed at Malay audiences in Malaya, creating a formula of songs, beautiful scenery and romance that was followed for decades afterwards. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran described it as <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of Indonesian cinema for its catalytic effect on the industry's growth. Like many Indonesian films of the era, Terang Boelan has been lost {{since at least the}} 1970s.|$|E

5|$|The 1687 {{earthquake}} marked <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{history of}} Lima as it {{coincided with a}} recession in trade, a reduction of silver production and economic competition by other cities such as Buenos Aires. To add to these problems, on October 28, 1746, a powerful earthquake severely damaged the city and destroyed Callao, forcing a massive rebuilding effort under Viceroy José Antonio Manso de Velasco. This disaster led to an intense devotion for an image of Christ called The Lord of the Miracles, which has been taken out in procession every October since 1746.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Marathon (Greek: , Machē tou Marathōnos) {{took place}} in 490 BC, during the first Persian {{invasion}} of Greece. It was fought between the citizens of Athens, aided by Plataea, and a Persian force commanded by Datis and Artaphernes. The battle {{was the culmination of}} the first attempt by Persia, under King Darius I, to subjugate Greece. The Greek army decisively defeated the more numerous Persians, marking <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Greco-Persian Wars.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Romani was {{the first}} {{large-scale}} mounted and infantry victory by the British Empire in the First World War. It occurred {{at a time when}} the Allied nations had experienced nothing but defeat, in France, at Salonika and at the capitulation of Kut in Mesopotamia. The battle has been widely acknowledged as a strategic victory and <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> campaign to restore Egypt's territorial integrity and security, and marked the end of the land campaign against the Suez Canal.|$|E
