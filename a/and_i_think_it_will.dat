5|$|Gouverneur Morris is credited, {{both now}} and then, {{as the chief}} {{draftsman}} of the final document, including the stirring preamble. Not all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen left before the ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: Edmund Randolph of Virginia, George Mason of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. George Mason demanded a Bill of Rights if he was to support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights {{was not included in}} the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow. Shortly before the document was to be signed, Gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from 40,000 to 30,000 citizens. A similar measure had been proposed earlier, and failed by one vote. George Washington spoke up here, making his only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate. Gorham would sign the document, although he had openly doubted whether the United States would remain a single, unified nation for more than 150 years. Ultimately, 39 of the original 55 delegates ended up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied. Their views were summed up by Benjamin Franklin, who said, I confess that There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them.... I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able to make a better Constitution.... It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> astonish our enemies...|$|E

It will really test them and their {{relationship}} to the nth degree, and we'll see whether they can recover from it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Berlusconi {{is among}} the most vocal {{supporters}} of closer ties between Russia and the European Union. In an article published in Italian media on 26 May 2002, he said that the next step in Russia's growing integration with the West should be EU membership. On 17 November 2005, Berlusconi commented, in relation to the prospect of such membership, that he is [...] "convinced that even if it is a dream ... it is not too distant a dream <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> happen one day." [...] The Prime Minister of Italy has made similar comments on other occasions as well.|$|E
2500|$|The {{title track}} and opening song, [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again", was {{compared}} to her debut single, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), featuring a slap-and-pop bassline, synthesizer chord stabs and a mechanized beat. Lyrically, the song sees Spears warning to an overeager prospective lover: [...] "Oops, you think I'm in love/That I'm sent from above — I'm not that innocent." [...] The song also breaks down for a spoken-word interlude, involving {{a line from the}} film Titanic (1997). The second track [...] "Stronger" [...] is a synthpop and R track, which is lyrically a declaration of independence, where Spears leaves a partner who treats her like property. The line [...] "my loneliness ain't killing me no more" [...] makes reference to the verse [...] "my loneliness is killing me" [...] from her song [...] "...Baby One More Time". Another R track, which also adds a bit more funk to the mix, [...] "Don't Go Knocking on My Door" [...] finds Spears confidently forging ahead after a breakup. The fourth track, a cover of the Rolling Stones' [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", begins with mushy guitar plucking and breathy coos, until a dry, crackling lockstep is thrown down, turning the song into an urban stomp. The dance-pop version also jettisons the song's final verse and adds some new lyrics ("how white my shirts could be" [...] becomes [...] "how tight my skirt should be"). [...] " [...] was my idea [...] ", Spears said. [...] "I was just like, 'I like this song,' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be a really cool combination working with [...] Rodney [...] and doing a really funky song like that." [...] The fifth track, [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", was co-written by country-pop singer-songwriter Shania Twain and her then-husband, producer Robert [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, who also produced the track. The ballad, which boasts a slinky keyboard riff and Lange's characteristically lavish production, finds Spears allowing a bit of country twang into her vocals as she begs a lover to reveal his feelings: [...] "My friends say you're into me ... but I need to hear it straight from you", she sings. The sixth track [...] "What U See (Is What U Get)" [...] demands respect by rebuking a jealous partner, while the seventh track, [...] "Lucky", is a heart-rending tale of a Hollywood starlet's loneliness, proving that fame can be empty. [...] "If there's nothing missing in my life/Then why do these tears come at night?", she asks. [...] "School crush" [...] is the theme of [...] "One Kiss from You", a track that has a reggae-style beat and lyrics about the feelings of falling in love, and the quickness of it, with Spears cooing that after only one kiss she sees her entire future with her lover. The ballad [...] "Where Are You Now" [...] talks about wanting to know where a previous love is, and what that person is up to, so that she can finally let them go and find closure. Lines on [...] "Can't Make You Love Me", an Europop song, state that fancy cars and money pale in comparison to true love, with Spears singing: [...] "I'm just a girl with a crush on you." [...] The mid-tempo, synth-backed [...] "When Your Eyes Say It", written by songwriter Diane Warren, combines a string section with a loping hip hop beat, while Spears makes her own songwriting debut on the modest, keyboard-driven ballad [...] "Dear Diary", which she said is autobiographical. On the track, she sings of wanting to become [...] "so much more than friends" [...] with a boy.|$|E
