5000|$|<b>Primitive</b> ideal: <b>A</b> left <b>primitive</b> {{ideal is}} the {{annihilator}} {{of a simple}} left module. <b>A</b> right <b>primitive</b> ideal is defined similarly. Actually (despite the name) {{the left and right}} primitive ideals are always two-sided ideals. Primitive ideals are prime. A factor rings constructed with <b>a</b> right (left) <b>primitive</b> ideals is <b>a</b> right (left) <b>primitive</b> ring. For commutative rings the primitive ideals are maximal, and so commutative primitive rings are all fields.|$|R

5|$|An {{expanded}} {{edition of}} The Stand {{was published in}} 1990, restoring text that had been cut from the original edition. It includes an epilogue in which Flagg appears on a beach and finds <b>a</b> <b>primitive</b> tribe ready to fall under his influence.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>primitive</b> nervous system, without centralization, {{coordinates}} {{the processes}} involved in maintaining homeostasis, as well as biochemical and physical responses to various stimuli. There are two nerve nets, one in the epidermis {{and one in the}} gastrodermis; these unite at the pharynx, the junctions of the septa with the oral disc and the pedal disc, and across the mesogloea. No specialized sense organs are present but sensory cells include nematocytes and chemoreceptors.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{religious}} beliefs are represented among the novel's characters. Jacob Brattle is an unbeliever. Puddleham is <b>a</b> <b>Primitive</b> Methodist. The Stowte family, {{to which the}} marquis belongs, are Low Church Anglicans, and Fenwick is High church and latitudinarian. Their charity is tested by their response to Carry Brattle, and it is Fenwick who passes the test. As William Cadbury expresses it, Puddleham has been hardened by too much doctrine, Jacob Brattle by too little.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 13th century, <b>a</b> <b>primitive</b> form of milling the silk threads was already in use. In 1221 Jean de Garlande's dictionary, and in 1226, Étienne Boileau's Livre des métiers (Tradesman's Handbook) {{enumerated}} many types of devices which can only have been doubling machines. The instruments used were further perfected in Bologna between 1270 and 1280. From {{the start of}} the 14th century, many documents allude to the use of devices that were quite complex.|$|E
5|$|Communications usually {{consisted}} of FuG X, the later FuG 10 (Funkgerät), navigational direction finder PeilG V direction finder (PeilG - Peilgerät) and the FuG 25 IFF and FuBI 1 blind-landing devices. The crew communicated by EiV intercom. <b>A</b> <b>primitive</b> autopilot device, the Siemens K4Ü, was installed and could maintain bearing using the rudder's control surfaces.|$|E
5|$|From the 12th to the 16th century zinc {{and zinc}} oxide were {{recognized}} and produced in India using <b>a</b> <b>primitive</b> {{form of the}} direct synthesis process.

5|$|It is {{now clear}} that the common {{ancestor}} of the bony fishes (Osteichthyes) had <b>a</b> <b>primitive</b> air-breathing lung—later evolved into a swim bladder in most actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes). This suggests that crossopterygians evolved in warm shallow waters, using their simple lung when the oxygen level in the water became too low.|$|E
5|$|Lodging in {{the park}} is {{available}} at Zion Lodge, located halfway through Zion Canyon. Three campgrounds are available: South and Watchman at the far southern side of the park, and <b>a</b> <b>primitive</b> site at Lava Point {{in the middle of}} the park off Kolob Terrace Road. Overnight camping in the backcountry requires permits.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{urged his}} aides {{to break the}} news gently to Ida, and to call off the mob that had set on Czolgosz—a request that may have saved his assassin's life. McKinley was taken to the Exposition aid station, where the doctor was unable to locate the second bullet. Although <b>a</b> <b>primitive</b> X-ray machine was being {{exhibited}} on the Exposition grounds, it was not used. McKinley was taken to the Milburn House.|$|E

5|$|Sporadic privately {{operated}} ferry services between Adolphustown and Stone Mills (Glenora) {{were initially}} <b>a</b> <b>primitive</b> affair. In October 1835 a Mr. Clark from Cobourg tipped {{out of the}} bark canoe ferrying him to Glenora and was buried without an inquest; a year earlier, a Rev. Mathew Miller from Cobourg had drowned after falling through the February ice. The road itself was no better, barely adequate for horse and rider but unfit to run stagecoach lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{control of}} migration, its timing and {{response}} are genetically controlled {{and appear to}} be <b>a</b> <b>primitive</b> trait that is present even in non-migratory species of birds. The ability to navigate and orient themselves during migration {{is a much more}} complex phenomenon that may include both endogenous programs as well as learning.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} experimental work related to decompression {{was conducted by}} Robert Boyle, who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient pressure by use of <b>a</b> <b>primitive</b> vacuum pump. In the earliest experiments the subjects died from asphyxiation, but in later experiments signs of what was later to become known as decompression sickness were observed.|$|E

5|$|This is <b>a</b> <b>primitive</b> {{order and}} members do not extrude their stomach when feeding, lack an anus {{and have no}} suckers on their tube feet. Papulae are {{plentiful}} on their aboral surface and they possess marginal plates and paxillae. They mostly inhabit soft-bottomed areas of sand or mud. There is no brachiolaria stage in their larval development. The comb starfish (Astropecten polyacanthus) {{is a member of}} this order.|$|E
5|$|A fragmentary molar, {{preserving}} two cusps, {{is identified}} as from a multituberculate. Although multituberculates are common in nearly contemporaneous deposits in Laurasia, this tooth {{is one of the}} few records from Gondwana; a few fragmentary remains, the multituberculate affinities of some of which are disputed, are also known from South America (Argentodites), Africa (Hahnodon), and Australia (Corriebaatar). Another fragmentary tooth, UA 8699, is recognizable as a tribosphenic lower molar. Krause identified it in 2001 as a marsupial, but in 2003 a group led by Alexander Averianov instead argued that the tooth was placental and related to zhelestids (<b>a</b> <b>primitive</b> group possibly related to ungulates). Both placentals and marsupials are mostly known from Laurasia during the Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} push-pull train capabilities with {{the provision of}} <b>a</b> <b>primitive</b> cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} save time on country branch lines where the locomotive would usually have to run around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible for the driver to drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving the fireman to tend the fire and operate the injectors on the locomotive footplate.|$|E
