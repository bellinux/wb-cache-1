5|$|When the American Revolutionary War {{began in}} 1775, the Ohio River marked a tenuous {{border between the}} <b>American</b> <b>colonies</b> and the American Indians of the Ohio Country. Ohio Indians—Shawnees, Mingos, Delawares, and Wyandots—were divided over {{how to respond to}} the war. Some Indian leaders urged neutrality, while others entered the war because they saw it as an {{opportunity}} to halt the expansion of the <b>American</b> <b>colonies</b> and to regain lands previously lost to the colonists.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} of whiskey {{was certainly not}} a norm in the colonies in the early years. The upper echelon of colonial society looked down upon American whiskey up until {{the time of the}} American Revolution. Some even saw the harsh spirit as a bastion of debauchery in the <b>American</b> <b>colonies.</b> Whatever the sentiment, the Scottish, Irish, and Germans brought a taste for hard spirits from their homelands to the <b>American</b> <b>colonies</b> in the 1730s. These groups continued to produce hard spirits in imported stills, or stills based on Old World designs, in retaliation against the English economic controls.|$|E

5|$|During the 16th century, Bristol merchants {{concentrated}} on developing trade with Spain and its <b>American</b> <b>colonies.</b> This included the smuggling of prohibited goods, {{such as food}} and guns, to Iberia during the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604). Bristol's illicit trade grew enormously after 1558, becoming integral to its economy.|$|E

5|$|The Collections {{include a}} unique proof sheet of 26 Revenue 1765 Newspaper and Pamphlet one penny {{impressions}} showing the registration certificate, {{held in the}} Board of Inland Revenue Stamping Department Archive. These were issued to apply the Stamp Act of 1765 intended to raise taxes to fund the defence of the <b>American</b> <b>Colonies</b> from the French. The tax applied to legal documents, licences, newspapers, pamphlets and almanacs in the <b>American</b> <b>Colonies,</b> Quebec, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Florida, the Bahamas and the West Indian Islands. The taxes resulted in public protest and rioting. The tax was abandoned {{after a few months}} due to its unpopularity but the political damage contributed to the War of Independence in 1775.|$|E

5|$|The {{colony of}} Rhode Island was {{established}} in the 17th century, and {{was the first of the}} thirteen original <b>American</b> <b>colonies</b> to declare independence from British rule in 1776, signaling the start of the American Revolution. The counties were all established before the Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>American</b> <b>colonies</b> went to war, {{they needed}} soldiers, supplies, {{and lots of}} them. Soldiers needed uniforms and, as all {{shipping}} into the colonies had ceased, wool became an integral commodity to the war effort. During the Revolution the consumption of mutton ceased almost entirely in many areas, and in Virginia it became illegal to consume except in cases of extreme necessity.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the Seven Years' War, Euro-American {{settlers}} began trickling into east Tennessee from the eastern colonies. In 1772, several pioneers negotiated a lease for Cherokee lands in northeast Tennessee and formed the Watauga Settlement. In spite of the agreement, tensions between the pioneers and the Cherokee rose steadily. By the outbreak of the American Revolution, the Cherokee were allied with the British against the rebellious <b>American</b> <b>colonies,</b> hoping to push the encroaching settlers out of their territory.|$|E

5|$|Carleton then {{launched}} his own offensive intended {{to reach the}} Hudson River, whose navigable length begins south of Lake Champlain and extends down to New York City. Control of the upper Hudson would enable the British to link their forces in Quebec with those in New York, recently captured in the New York campaign by Major General William Howe. This strategy would separate the <b>American</b> <b>colonies</b> of New England from those farther south and potentially quash the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|During Gage's {{administration}} political tensions rose {{throughout the}} <b>American</b> <b>colonies.</b> As a result, Gage began withdrawing {{troops from the}} frontier to fortify urban centres like New York City and Boston. As the number of soldiers stationed in cities grew, {{the need to provide}} adequate food and housing for these troops became urgent. Parliament passed the Quartering Act of 1765, permitting British troops to be quartered in vacant houses, barns, and outbuildings, but not private residences.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, Banagher was {{the centre}} of a flourishing woollen trade. In 1699, the impost placed on the export of woollen goods to England {{practically}} killed the woollen trade. At {{the outbreak of the}} American Revolutionary War in 1775, an embargo placed on the export of foodstuffs to the <b>American</b> <b>Colonies</b> dealt another blow to the trade of Banagher. In 1780, the British Parliament withdrew all these restrictions and Banagher's economy began to improve rapidly.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 16th century, islanders {{travelled}} across the North Atlantic {{to participate in}} the Newfoundland fisheries. In recognition for help given to him during his exile in Jersey in the 1640s, King Charles II of England gave Vice Admiral Sir George Carteret, bailiff and governor, a large grant of land in the <b>American</b> <b>colonies</b> in between the Hudson and Delaware rivers, which he promptly named New Jersey. It is now a state in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{were then}} punished for {{supporting}} the British invasion, and the fortress city of Intramuros, initially populated by 1200 Spanish families and garrisoned by 400 Spanish troops, kept its cannons pointed at Binondo, the world's oldest Chinatown. The Mexican population was concentrated at the south part of Manila, and also at Cavite, where ships from Spain's <b>American</b> <b>colonies</b> docked, and at Ermita, an area so named because of a Mexican hermit that lived there.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Coryat a {{traveller}} {{and writer}} of the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean age was born in Crewkerne around 1577. Mathematician John Caswell was also born here. A later traveller Colonel Joshua Fry {{was born in the}} town in 1699 before becoming a surveyor, adventurer, mapmaker, soldier, and member of the House of Burgesses, the legislature of the colony of Virginia. Another Englishman from Crewkerne who emigrated to the <b>American</b> <b>Colonies</b> was William Phelps who was born around 1599 and became {{one of the founders of}} both Dorchester, Massachusetts and Windsor, Connecticut, foreman of the first grand jury in New England, served most of his life in early colonial government, and played a key role in establishing the first democratic town government in the <b>American</b> <b>colonies.</b> Ralph Reader CBE an actor, theatrical producer and songwriter, best known for staging the original Gang Show, a Variety show for members of the Scouting Movement, was born in Crewkerne in 1903. The cricketer Michael Barnwell was born in the town in 1943.|$|E
