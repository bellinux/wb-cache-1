5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of Results May Vary track listing, Page Hamilton of Helmet and Rivers Cuomo of Weezer recorded songs with Limp Bizkit for the album; Al Jourgensen of Ministry also joined the band in the studio. Jourgensen claims that he convinced Fred Durst to strip naked and wear <b>a</b> <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat</b> while singing. The contributions of all three were omitted from the finished album. Bubba Sparxxx joined Durst in a Los Angeles studio, but his contributions also {{did not make the}} album. Durst wrote over 30 songs with Limp Bizkit drummer John Otto and the band's bassist, Sam Rivers. During production of Results May Vary, Durst listened to the Cure, Patsy Cline, Mazzy Star and classical music.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Corgan reading {{a comic book}} dressed in an ice cream man uniform. A clip of the intro to the song is played and stopped {{repeatedly}} before the song begins. Groups {{of two or more}} people are kissing each other around Corgan as he drives in an ice cream van through a desert. Corgan picks up a dress-wearing Iha and the two drive for a while before stopping at a gas station, where Chamberlin and Wretzky appear as gas attendants. After Iha changes into a yellow and white cowboy outfit, the band paints the van in a multitude of colors. More people are shown kissing in the hills as the band drives away from the gas station in the van. However, Corgan is ultimately kicked out of the van, and the video ends with Corgan walking off the road wearing <b>a</b> <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat</b> as the van drives away.

25|$|The {{music video}} for Manson's cover was {{a gateway to}} {{popularity}} for the band, eventually being nominated at the MTV Video Music Awards for Best Rock Video, and contains several clips of Manson and band members in {{what appears to be}} an old, decrepit asylum whilst wearing a variety of strange costumes. The overall video was shot with unusual filters: {{this was one of the}} first videos shot with director Dean Karr's initial vision intact, not based solely on whatever ideas the band had come up with prior. In between these clips are a number of surreal shots of Manson wearing a wedding gown, Manson wandering around an abandoned street in a tutu, birds fluttering around him and leaving dropping on his body, and footage of him riding a pig wearing <b>a</b> <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat</b> whilst covered with mud which Manson rides during the song's climax.|$|E

[...] Earlier in the episode, Jemaine suggested that Bret should wear <b>a</b> <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat</b> to be more attractive to women.

500|$|Despite Hawks's work in {{a variety}} of Hollywood genres, he still {{retained}} an independent sensibility. Film critic David Thomson wrote of Hawks: [...] "Far from being the meek purveyor of Hollywood forms, he always chose to turn them upside down. To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep, ostensibly an adventure and a thriller, are really love stories. Rio Bravo, apparently a Western – everyone wears <b>a</b> <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat</b> – is a comedy conversation piece. The ostensible comedies are shot through with exposed emotions, with the subtlest views of the sex war, and with a wry acknowledgment of the incompatibility of men and women." [...] David Boxwell argues that the filmmaker's body of work [...] "has been accused of a historical and adolescent escapism, but Hawks's fans rejoice in his oeuvre's remarkable avoidance of Hollywood's religiosity, bathos, flag-waving, and sentimentality.|$|E

The shots of male bondage are unexplained, and {{function}} as symbols of male disempowerment, just {{as the rest of the}} clip serves to assert the power and fighting abilities of the women. At the end the group captures a confused icecream man who appears in his pick-up truck. He is carried off on the roof of the car as a trophy. Another man with <b>a</b> <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat</b> is also captured and tied to his car. An alternate version of the video exists that removes the male bondage shots and replaces them with unseen shots of the girls. This version was never given an official release.|$|E
500|$|In April 2010, Harrison Ford {{was cast}} {{alongside}} Craig. Favreau had cast Craig and Ford {{in the film}} because they were actors who suited the action-adventure roles so the characters would be less seen as comedic. The director compared Ford, in particular, with John Wayne in having [...] "a sense of history" [...] with the actor and the role. Before Cowboys & Aliens, Ford had previously acted in the Western films A Time for Killing in 1967, Journey to Shiloh in 1969 and The Frisco Kid in 1979. While Ford {{is well known for}} playing Indiana Jones, the filmmakers wanted to avoid giving him <b>a</b> <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat</b> that would remind audiences too much of Jones. Writer Alex Kurtzman said, [...] "We needed to make sure that—no pun intended—we tipped a hat to iconography of Harrison Ford and also presented the audience with a very different version." ...|$|E

50|$|The <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat</b> is <b>a</b> high-crowned, wide-brimmed hat {{best known}} as the {{defining}} piece of attire for the North American cowboy.

It is recognized around the world as part of Old West lore. The shape of <b>a</b> <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat's</b> crown and brim are often modified by the wearer for fashion and to protect against weather.|$|R
500|$|At {{his high}} school reunion, Peter pretends to be a secret agent-astronaut-millionaire who wears <b>a</b> <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat</b> to impress his classmates, but the truth comes out when he meets Tom Brady. He {{subsequently}} gets drunk and {{has to make a}} run for the bathroom, knocking over everyone between him and the bathroom. Brady is impressed and gets Peter a spot on the New England Patriots football team as the starting center. Peter is soon fired for showboating in a game versus the Dallas Cowboys, driving on to the field then performing a massively-choreographed version of the song [...] "Shipoopi" [...] after scoring one touchdown. He is traded to the London Silly Nannies, who apparently have no clue on how to play football. Peter decides to turn them around and challenges Brady to a game between the Silly Nannies and the Patriots. On the opening kickoff, Peter's teammates become terrified of the Patriots rushing toward them and run away, leaving Peter to face them alone. He tries and is immediately tackled. However, Brady compliments Peter on having the nerve to stand up to them.|$|E

2500|$|Max Tackett, a 33-year-old Arkansas State Police officer rookie at the time, {{realized}} that a car had been stolen on the nights of the murders, and a previously stolen car was found abandoned. On Friday, June 28, 1946, Tackett found a car that had been reported stolen in a parking lot. He staked out the car until someone came back to it. He arrested a 21-year-old woman. She said she had just married her husband in Shreveport, but he was currently in Atlanta, Texas trying to sell another stolen car. Homer Carter, chief of police in Atlanta, told Tackett that a man had tried selling a stolen car {{to one of his}} citizens. Tackett asked the citizen if he would recognize the suspect, but the man said that he would not. Tackett noticed that the citizen had a distinct look, which included <b>a</b> <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat</b> and boots. Tackett told the citizen, [...] "You wouldn't recognize him, but he would recognize you." [...] Max then asked the citizen if {{he would be willing to}} walk with him into several public places. Tackett had the idea that the suspect would not want to see the citizen and would try to avoid him. On a Saturday in July, Tackett walked into the Arkansas Motor Coach bus station on Front Street, near Union Station, with the citizen. Tackett saw a man run out the back of the building. He chased after him and caught him on the fire escape. The man, Youell Swinney, would not talk, but his wife Peggy confessed in great detail that he was the Phantom Killer and that he killed Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin.|$|E
2500|$|Stone Cold Steve Austin, who {{had turned}} heel at WrestleMania and formed an {{alliance}} with McMahon when he helped Austin win the WWF Championship, took a change in character during this time. Instead of being a beer-drinking redneck, he was more emotional and tried to cheer-up Vince McMahon, who was clearly stressed {{from the threat of}} The Alliance, by doing something generous like giving Vince <b>a</b> <b>cowboy</b> <b>hat</b> as a present. On the July 12 episode of SmackDown!, Austin played [...] "Kumbaya" [...] and [...] "We Are the Champions" [...] for McMahon, to which Vince was unresponsive. Later that night, Vince McMahon came out and asked Austin to come to the ring, announcing him as the man that would lead Team WWF into the pay-per-view and into victory. Upon entering, Vince McMahon told Austin that he had changed quite a bit since WrestleMania, and when the WWF goes up against The Alliance at the upcoming pay-per-view, he did not need an Austin that gave him hugs and gifts and baked him cookies. He needed the [...] "old" [...] Stone Cold who was a [...] "beer-swilling, foul-mouthed SOB" [...] and the [...] "old" [...] Stone Cold that [...] "didn't take shit from anyone". He asked Austin to knock him down, even yelling to the crowd, [...] "If you want Stone Cold to beat the living hell out of Vince McMahon, give me a hell yeah!" [...] to which the crowd responded enthusiastically. Austin, however, shook his head and proceeded to leave the ring, turning his back on Vince McMahon. Later that night when Diamond Dallas Page and Shane McMahon went up against the Undertaker and Kurt Angle, many members of the Alliance interfered. Kane and Jericho came to help their team, but the Alliance's numbers were too many, and without Austin to back up his teammates, Team WWF was overwhelmed.|$|E
