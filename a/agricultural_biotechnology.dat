25|$|A 2007 cable {{reports a}} meeting between several <b>agricultural</b> <b>biotechnology</b> {{companies}} (Dow Chemical Company, DuPont, Monsanto) where they raise concerns to the French governments stance on <b>agricultural</b> <b>biotechnology.</b> The concerns included the destruction of test fields by activists, whether French police will enforce vandalism laws, whether French farmers {{will have to be}} on a public list saying they are growing GMOs, and whether France will follow EU approval guidelines. Also the cable discussed an approval dispute about a genetically modified potato variety from BASF which the French government showed signs of approving, but later ruled against. No United States government representatives were involved.|$|E

40|$|Emerging {{markets have}} been {{particularly}} slow {{in terms of their}} adoption of <b>agricultural</b> <b>biotechnologies.</b> With that in mind, this research study explored the key success factors and common pitfalls in achieving market penetration with <b>agricultural</b> <b>biotechnologies</b> in the emerging market context, particularly in South Africa. By taking into consideration these factors for success and failure, this study investigated the marketing implications of the diffusion of innovation curve, as well as consumer behaviour, as it pertains to the attainment of market penetration of <b>agricultural</b> <b>biotechnologies</b> in South Africa. An in-depth case study was conducted on Westcape Biotech (a South African producer of <b>agricultural</b> <b>biotechnologies)</b> to explore real-world, context-specific insights related to the commercialisation (and market penetration) of these products and services. Data was collected from Westcape Biotech management, as well as from its existing and prospective customers, in order to arrive at an objective view of the various successes and challenges in the organisation's market entry strategy to date. The Bass forecasting model was applied to explore how marketing information spreads through various consumer groups at various points in a product or service's life cycle. By following this model, it is proposed that the producers of <b>agricultural</b> <b>biotechnologies</b> might persuade more risk-averse consumers (i. e. the late majority, 'laggards') to adopt these products/services at an earlier phase in the diffusion of innovation cycle, which in turn has far-reaching implications on the resource intensiveness of achieving market penetration in the emerging market context...|$|R

25|$|Several tobacco {{plants have}} been used as model organisms in genetics. Tobacco BY-2 cells, derived from N. tabacum {{cultivar}} 'Bright Yellow-2', are among the most important research tools in plant cytology. Tobacco has played a pioneering role in callus culture research and the elucidation of the mechanism by which kinetin works, laying the groundwork for modern <b>agricultural</b> <b>biotechnology.</b> The first genetically modified plant was produced in 1982, using Agrobacterium tumefaciens to create an antibiotic-resistant tobacco plant.

25|$|The {{area sown}} to genetically {{engineered}} crops {{in developing countries}} is rapidly catching up with the area sown in industrial nations. According to the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), GM crops were grown by approximately 8.5 million farmers in 21 countries in 2005; up from 8.25 million farmers in 17 countries in 2004.

40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years, <b>agricultural</b> <b>biotechnologies</b> have {{generated}} chronically unresolved political controversies. The standard tool of risk assessment {{has proven to be}} highly limited in its ability to address the panoply of concerns that exist about these hybrid techno/organisms. It has also failed to account for both the conceptual and material networks of relations <b>agricultural</b> <b>biotechnologies</b> require, create and/or perform. This paper takes as a starting point that <b>agricultural</b> <b>biotechnologies</b> cannot be usefully assessed as isolated technological entities but need to be evaluated {{within the context of the}} broader socio-ecological system that they embody and engender. The paper then explores, compares and contrasts some of the methodological tools available for advancing this systems-based perspective. The article concludes by outlining a new synthesis approach of comparative cartographies of agri/cultures generated through multi-sited ethnographic case-studies, which is proposed as a way to generate system maps and enable the comparison of genetically modified (GM) food with both conventional and alternative agri-food networks for sustainability assessment. The paper aims to make a unique theoretical and methodological contribution by advancing a systems-based approach to conceptualising and assessing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and proposing a synthesised methodology for mapping networks of relations across different agri/cultures...|$|R

The development of modern <b>agricultural</b> <b>biotechnologies</b> and their derived products have been controversial. Biotech foods are allegedly underpinned by scientific uncertainty. To regulate such technologies and to ensure information and safety, the European Union has adopted a precautionary approach relying on premarket authorisation and mandatory labelling. Despite these provisions, biotech foods continue to attract close scrutiny, in particular from the EU public. Against this background, this opinion explains why I came to research biotech foods, how these foods are currently regulated in the EU and why the existing regimes could be improved to allow for the consideration of consumer preferences and more generally non-scientific factors...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{highlight}} {{the issues that}} were given particular attention during the workshop discussions by stakeholders. The paper is structured in four sections in which each of the issues (i) the (technical) solution offered; (ii) the problem phrasing of the potato disease; (iii) the durability of {{the resistance of the}} GM potato; (iv) and patenting and ownership are described in more detail. We describe how the issues were addressed by workshop participants, present relevant scientific literature in the field and make suggestions for future research needs. A key contribution of this paper is the empirical insight on stakeholder perspectives on emerging plant-breeding techniques, thereby underscoring the importance of broadening the scope of the debate on the opportunities and challenges of <b>agricultural</b> <b>biotechnologies,</b> such as cisgenic GM plants. In terms of its policy relevance, the paper offers a valuable contribution to ongoing efforts and a growing need to broaden the scope of risk assessments of <b>agricultural</b> <b>biotechnologies,</b> as for instant reflected in the new European legislation on GMOs (Directive 2015 / 412). By addressing these concerns, we aim to broaden the debate so as to acknowledge, discuss and contribute to respond to them.|$|R

In this context of evolutionary intellectual property rights, the markets of the agricultural genetic resources are based on goods and services related to the management of agro biodiversity.

More recently, LAC countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, and Uruguay have commercially grown transgenic crops.
