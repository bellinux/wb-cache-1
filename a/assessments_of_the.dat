5|$|<b>Assessments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{mating system}} {{of this species}} have found that outcrossing rates vary between populations, with populations in {{disturbed}} environments tending to be more inbred than populations in relatively intact bushland. This {{has been attributed to}} a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective selfing. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an understorey, and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon sporadic visits for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations.|$|E
5|$|Because {{judicial}} decisions {{are subject to}} the sometimes arbitrary <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CCP, citizens who attempt {{to make use of the}} legal system to pursue grievances find that, if their cause is determined to have the potential to undermine the authority of the Communist Party, they may be suppressed.

5|$|Furthermore, despite {{changes to}} the {{campaign}} finance laws, there was no perceptible decrease in campaigning activity. One reason was a compensatory expansion of advertising by way of internet search engines such as Facebook and other social media which were relatively inexpensive. Helsingin Sanomat called election workers in all electoral districts, excluding the Åland Islands, to ask for their <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electoral campaigns. They reported that while the NCP's campaign was the most visible, the Centre Party and the Social Democrats also had high-profile campaigns with some variations across districts. The NCP were also said to be spending more {{of their own money}} than in the past.|$|E
30|$|Benevolence or malevolence is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key {{dimensions}} <b>of</b> trust or distrust.

Benevolence is different from credibility, which {{is believed to be}} associated with cognitive <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> contracts, laws, and structural assurances (Williamson 1985). On the opposite note, malevolence is associated with <b>the</b> trustor’s emotional <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trustee’s negative and/or harmful behavior. Malevolence is different from discredibility, which deals with <b>the</b> trustor’s cognitive <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential loss through the trustee’s incompetence and unreliability.|$|R

Personnel losses of 499,001 (permanent as well as temporary) were calculated by the Soviet command. On 9 October, Otto Dietrich of the German Ministry of Propaganda, quoting Hitler himself, forecast {{in a press conference}} the imminent destruction of the armies defending Moscow. As Hitler had never had to lie about a specific and verifiable military fact, Dietrich convinced foreign correspondents that the collapse of all Soviet resistance was perhaps hours away. German civilian morale—low since the start of Barbarossa—significantly improved, with rumors of soldiers home by Christmas and great riches from the future Lebensraum in the east.|$|E

Australian <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Viet Cong 275th Regiment were seemingly reinforced by its unsuccessful attempt to ambush a convoy from US 11th Armoured Cavalry Regiment (11 ACR) on 2 December 1966. Meanwhile, after Westmoreland had again pressed Vincent on what he saw as the limited results achieved by Australian tactics, a large joint US-Australian operation was mounted against the May Tao mountains in Phuoc Tuy, moving against the communist bases in the area. The largest search and destroy operation mounted by the Australians to that point, Operation Paddington (9–15 July) was carried out in co-operation with American and South Vietnamese units based in Bien Hoa province, and targeted the Viet Cong 5th Division.|$|E
