40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to propose a {{comprehensive}} literature review of past studies on value creation and value <b>appropriation,</b> with focus on the critical understandings of key factors impacting the two. A literature review provides critical understandings from the paradox on strategic choice between value creation and value <b>appropriation</b> to key factors influencing the mechanism of creating and appropriating values. By reviewing 27 articles, this thesis concludes five top findings. First, value creation and value <b>appropriation</b> {{are closely related to}} innovation, which has an important influence on value creation and <b>appropriation</b> decisions.

Both external search breadth and depth are positively associated with firms’ use of informal <b>appropriation</b> mechanisms, while only external search breadth is positively associated with formal <b>appropriation</b> mechanisms. Firms’ degree of radical (incremental) innovation orientation is negatively (positively) associated with their use of formal <b>appropriation</b> mechanisms. Analysis of the joint impact of openness and innovativeness, suggests that for radical innovators it is external search breadth (rather than depth) that has a positive association {{with the use of}} informal <b>appropriation</b> mechanisms.

Two days later, Randall's <b>Appropriations</b> committee reported several funding bills with his support.

40|$|Purpose – Value <b>appropriation</b> is a central, yet {{neglected}} aspect {{in business}} exchange research. The {{purpose of the}} paper is to generate an overview of research on active value <b>appropriation</b> in business exchange and provide the foundation for further research into value <b>appropriation,</b> {{as well as some}} initial guidance for managers. Design/methodology/approach – Literatures investigating value <b>appropriation</b> were identified by the means of a systematic review of the overall management literature. Findings – The authors provide an overview and comparison of the literatures and find that they apply diverse understandings of the value <b>appropriation</b> process and emphasize different mechanisms and outcomes of value <b>appropriation.</b> Research limitations/implications – Based on the literature comparison and discussion, in combination with inspiration from alternative business exchange literature, the authors propose four areas with high potential for future research into value appropriation: network position effects, <b>appropriation</b> acts and behaviors, buyer-seller relationship effects, and <b>appropriation</b> over time. Practical implications – Boundary spanning managers acting in industrial markets must master the difficult balance between value creation and <b>appropriation.</b> This review has provided an overview of the many managerial options for value <b>appropriation</b> and created knowledge on the effects of the various <b>appropriation</b> mechanisms enabling managers to secure company rents while not jeopardizing value creation. Originality/value – To the authors’ knowledge, this paper represents the first attempt at reviewing the management literature on value <b>appropriation</b> in business exchange. The authors provide overview, details, comparisons, and frame a research agenda as a first step towards establishing value <b>appropriation</b> as a key phenomenon in business exchange research.

40|$|This thesis studies {{contemporary}} poetry’s {{innovations in}} textual borrowing {{and the range}} and scope of its appropriative practices. The restrictions of the inherited definitions of <b>appropriation</b> include a limited capacity for expression and meaningfulness, a partial concept of appropriation’s critical capacity, and an inadequate sense of the poet’s individual and unique practice of <b>appropriation.</b> This thesis resolves the problematic constraints limiting contemporary definitions of <b>appropriation</b> by tracing {{the history of the}} practice to reveal an enduring relation between <b>appropriation</b> and poetic expression. Close readings of Trevor Joyce’s, Alan Halsey’s, and Susan Howe’s poetry serve as evidence of contemporary poetry’s development of <b>appropriation</b> beyond the current ascriptions and offer some direction on how the critical understanding of <b>appropriation</b> might be extended and redefined.
