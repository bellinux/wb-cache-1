40|$|In {{our study}} {{we present a}} {{technique}} of ureteroenteroanastomosis in cases of irreducible diseases of urinary bladder. Key words: dogs, ureteroenteroanastomosis, urinary bladder. The elaboration of a safe supravesical urinary deviation technique following {{the removal of the}} urinary bladder or as an optional therapeutic procedure in the management of urinary disorders has long captured the imagination of veterinary surgeons. Permanent urine deviation may be necessary in patients suffering from urinary bladder malignancy, before total cystectomy or as a palliative measure in massive, surgically non-removable tumors. Surgical management is also recommended in animals with retracted urinary bladder due to tuberculosis, irradiations or cystitis, when other more conservative measures have failed. Patients suffering from urinary fistula or neurologic dysfunction of the bladder may also benefit from this procedure (Martyn. A. et al., 1984). Materials and methods The ureteroenterostomy procedure was applied to three dogs suffering from incurable diseases of the urinary bladder. Common preoperative preparations, anesthesia, instruments and suture materials have been used. Surgical technique The first surgical step is median celiotomy for gaining access to the urinary tract. For better visualization of the ureters and urinary bladder, the wound margins are bee pulled aside and the intestines <b>are</b> <b>been</b> <b>pushed</b> cranially using a sterile wrap. The bladder was identified; each urether was isolated starting with its distal end and legated as close to the bladder as possible using non-absorbable material...|$|E
