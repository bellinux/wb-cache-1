5000|$|At {{physiological}} pH, retosiban {{exists in}} an uncharged state. It has good solubility (> 0.22 mg/ml), with a logd of 2.2. Retosiban {{consists of a}} central 2,5 diketopiperazine ring with an R-indanyl group at the 3 position and an R (S-secButyl) at the 6 position, both cis to each other, and with a R-2-methyl oxazole ring at the 7 position in the <b>acyclic</b> <b>amide</b> attached to the N1-position. Retosiban is the (3R, 6R, 7R)-isomer and is a sub-nanomolar (Ki = 0.65 nM) oxytocin receptor antagonist, while the (3R, 6R, 7S)-isomer where the stereochemistry in the amide side-chain at C-7 is inverted, is 10-fold less potent. Typically in this series of 2,5 diketopiperazine oxytocin antagonists the (3S, 6S, 7S) isomer is >500 less active than the (3R, 6R, 7R)-isomer. In addition to the 2,5 diketopiperazine essential core, retosiban also contains several structural characteristics that improve its effectiveness and safety. An indanyl group at position 3 is the best choice in terms of oxytocin receptor antagonist potency, its replacement by phenethyl and benzyl groups led to a progressive weakening of activity. At C-3, a 4-carbon branched alkyl was shown to be preferred with R (S-secButyl) being the best; smaller alkyl groups result in reduced antagonist activity. [...] The 2-methyl oxazole ring at the 7 position gives good aqueous solubility, low protein binding and minimal Cyp450 interaction.|$|E
40|$|Four {{membered}} b-Lactam rings do {{not show}} unusual reactivity compared with their <b>acyclic</b> <b>amide</b> analogues {{and there is no}} evidence of concerted mechanisms for nucleophilic substitution reactions at the carbonyl centre. The identity of the general base/acid catalyst in the serine b-Lactamases, which catalyse the hydrolysis of b-Lactams, is unknown. There are no ideal transition state analogue inhibitors for these enzymes which involve several intermediates and transition states. The class C serine b-Lactamase enhances the rate of phosphonylation of its active site serine residue by a similar magnitude to the enzyme rate enhancement factor for the hydrolysis of b-Lactams. Comparisons are made between the stereochemical consequences of tetrahedral and trigonal bipyramidal intermediates for hydrolysis and phosphonylation respectively. Class B zinc b-Lactamases are inhibited by thiol dipeptides with a D configuration at the cysteine centre analogous to the L configuration at C 6 in penicillins. The mechanism of hydrolysis catalysed by the metallo-b-Lactamases probably involves a di-anionic tetrahedral intermediate stabilised by zinc(II) ...|$|E

This analogue {{consists of a}} conformationally constrained backbone entity which emulates a B-DNA geometry, to which the nucleobases were attached via an extended, <b>acyclic</b> <b>amide</b> linker. Homobasic adenine-containing bca-decamers form duplexes with complementary oligonucleotides containing the bca-, the DNA the RNA and, surprisingly, also the L-RNA backbone. UV- and CD-spectroscopic investigations revealed the duplexes with D- or L-complement to be of similar stability and enantiomorphic in structure. Bca-oligonucleotides containing all four bases form strictly antiparallel, left-handed complementary duplexes with itself and complementary DNA but not with RNA. Base-mismatch discrimination is {{comparable to that of}} DNA while the overall thermal stabilities of bca-oligonucleotide duplexes are inferior relative to that of DNA or RNA. A detailed molecular modeling study of left- and right-handed bca-DNA containing duplexes showed only minor changes in the backbone structure and revealed a structural switch around the base-linker unit to be responsible for the generation of enantiomorphic duplex structures.

40|$|The amide {{functional}} group {{is one of}} the most fundamental motifs found in chemistry and biology, and it has been studied extensively for the past century. Typical <b>acyclic</b> <b>amides</b> are planar. But the amide groups of bicyclic bridgehead lactams are highly twisted, and this distortion from planarity can dramatically affect the stability and reactivity of these amides; it also increases the basicity of the nitrogen so that it often behaves more like an amine than a typical planar amide. As a result, the structures and reactivity profiles of these 'anti-Bredt' amides differ significantly from those of planar amides. It is possible that this twisting phenomenon is not exclusive to cyclic systems—non-planarity may also be a critical biological design element that leads to amide ground-state destabilization and alters the reactivity, selectivity and mechanism of various protein and enzymatic processes (such as amide hydrolysis). The intriguing qualities of these twisted amides were first recognized in 1938 (ref. 11), wherein one of the simplest families was introduced—molecules containing the 1 -azabicyclo[2. 2. 2]octan- 2 -one system. But the parent member of this group, 2 -quinuclidone (molecule 1 in this paper), has not yet been unambiguously synthesized. Here, we report the chemical synthesis, isolation and full characterization of the HBF_ 4 salt of 1. Critical to the success of the synthesis and isolation was the decision to generate 1 by a route other than classical amide bond formation. We anticipate that these results will provide a greater understanding of the properties of amide bonds...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA new, simple {{procedure}} for {{the determination of}} partition coefficients (P) was developed based on spectral effects caused upon addition of solutes to spin labeled model lipid membranes, and on the knowledge of their water solubility. Values of P were determined for nine local anesthetics (LA), amino-esters and amino-amides. The results were in good agreement with those found by phase separation and by a more complex, previously reported, methodology (Lissi et al. (1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1021, 46 – 50) applied to either EPR or fluorescence spectra of probes incorporated in the bilayers. Both {{the present and the}} previously reported procedures make use of effects on membrane structure evaluated by spectroscopic techniques and offer the advantage of not requiring phase separation. The spectral effects, indicative of a decrease in bilayer organization increased with LA concentration, reaching a maximum at the drug water solubility, indicating that partitioning in the membrane is limited by saturation of the aqueous phase. A thermodynamic analysis of the partition data according to Hill (Hill, M. W. (1974) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 356, 117 – 124) showed that the LAs did not display ideal behavior. Knowledge of the partition coefficients allowed a comparison between effects at the same drug concentration in the membrane. Within a given family (esters, <b>acyclic</b> <b>amides,</b> cyclic amides) no clear proportionality was observed between effect and LA hydrophibicity, as reflected in the partition coefficient. Rather, the membrane perturbing ability is a result of steric effects originating in the mismatch between anesthetic and phospholipid shapes...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} metal-free reactions to obtain carbon-heteroatom and carbon-carbon bonds. This is achieved by transferring carbon ligands from hypervalent iodine reagents to suitable nucleophiles. The bulk of the work presented herein concerns arylation of oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles, using the well-known diaryliodonium salts as aryl sources. In the first project, O-arylation of the oxime ethyl acetohydroxamate was studied. It was found that electron-poor as well as electron-rich aryl moieties could be transferred successfully to this nucleophile. Furthermore, the protocol could be extended to a sequential one-pot synthesis of benzo[b]furans. This method allowed for a fast synthesis of the natural product stemofuran A and formal syntheses of other natural products. In a successive project, O-arylation of hydroxide and aliphatic alkoxides was investigated. It is known that electron-poor aryl moieties can be transferred to these nucleophiles in moderate to high yields. However, combined with more electron-rich diaryliodonium salts, {{a large amount of}} side products were formed. These were suppressed upon addition of aryne traps, suggesting that aryne pathways are competing with the desired ligand coupling. It was also observed that secondary alcohols were oxidized to the corresponding ketones. The mechanism for this oxidation was investigated and aryne pathways could be excluded. Instead we suggest that the carbinol hydrogen gets deprotonated via an internal mechanism, after the alkoxide has coordinated to the iodonium salt. Highly sterically congested alkyl aryl ethers could be obtained in high yields by combining tertiary alcohols with ortho-blocked diaryliodonium salts.   Next, N-arylation of secondary <b>acyclic</b> <b>amides</b> was studied using acetanilide as the model substrate. This procedure was suitable for transfer of electron-poor as well as ortho-substituted aryl moieties, but attempts to transfer very electron-rich aryl groups were unsuccessful. On the other hand, the amides displayed a complementary reactivity, allowing phenylation of electron-rich amides.   In the final project, a one-pot synthesis of the cyclic iodonium reagent vinylbenziodoxolone is presented. These compounds have not been explored as reagents earlier. Initial screenings showed that the vinyl moiety could be transferred to nitrocyclohexane with opposite regioselectivity compared to the acyclic analogue of the reagent.

The first chapter describes {{our efforts to}} increase the stereoselectivity of a catalytic homoaldol reaction. This methodology features a second generation Binol titanium (IV) fluoride catalyst capable of opening a silyloxycyclopropane ring to form discrete homoenolates. These homoenolates react {{with a variety of}} aldehydes to form 1, 4 -hydroxy carbonyl compounds. The catalyst was prepared by a literature method and has improved the stereoselectivity of this reaction compared to the first generation Binol titanium (IV) triflate catalyst. A variety of substituted Binol ligands were studied to determine the effect of steric and electronic modifications on reaction selectivity. In the second chapter, a general method for the asymmetric synthesis of alpha,alpha-disubstituted-beta-hydroxy carbonyl compounds is described. This methodology relies on the stereoselective formation of <b>acyclic</b> alpha,alpha-disubstituted <b>amide</b> enolates.

We then used this chemistry to prepare a variety of tetrahydroquinoxalines and tetrahydroquinazolines in up to > 99 % ee. Chapter 2. A Method for the Pd-Catalyzed y-Arylation of Ketones and its Application to a One-Pot Synthesis of Tricyclic Indolines The Pd-catalyzed ca-arylation of enolates is a rapidly growing area of chemistry due its usefulness in constructing key C-C bonds. After thorough optimization, we have identified a catalyst system for the regioselective y-arylation of ketone dienolates, allowing for a convenient preparation of quaternary y-aryl ca,-unsaturated ketones. A key finding was {{the influence of the}} supporting ligand on the observed regioselectivity. Bidentate ligands with a small bite angle such as dppe allow for exclusive arylation at the y-position. As a novel application of this chemistry, we also developed a one-pot domino reaction of 2 -bromoanilines with P,y-unsaturated ketones for the preparation of indolines. Further, use of the chiral ligand DTBM-SegPhos allows for asymmetric induction with excellent levels of enantioselectivity. (cont.) Chapter 3. Synthesis of 5, 5 -Disubstituted Butenolides Based on a Pd-Catalyzed y-Arylation Strategy Given the utility and wide presence of butenolides in chemistry, and our recent foray into y-arylation chemistry, we sought to apply this chemistry to the preparation of y-aryl butenolides. Supporting ligands were identified that, when combined with a Pd source, catalyzed the site-specific y-arylation of butenolides {{with a wide variety of}} aryl halides. Progress was also made in the development of an asymmetric variant using chiral phosphine ligands. Preliminary screening results led us to prepare of a library of MOP-type ligands, which were tested with the use of high-throughput screening in a collaboration with Symyx. Chapter 4. Computational Studies on the Pd-Catalyzed Arylation of Amides and Enolates The rapid growth in the capability of computers and computational chemistry programs has been invaluable to the study of structure and mechanism in the field of catalysis. We have applied computational methods to study several catalytic reactions developed in the Buchwald lab: namely, the C- versus N-arylation of oxindoles, the N-arylation of amides with a newly-developed catalyst, and the regioselective y-arylation of dienolates. Beginning with oxindole arylation, we showed that the selectivity for C-arylation with a Pd/XPhos catalyst is governed by the relative barriers for reductive elimination and falls within the definition of a Curtin-Hammett situation while the N-arylation of oxindole with a Cu-based catalyst results from a large preference for binding of Cu to nitrogen. (cont.) In the second study, the arylation of <b>acyclic</b> secondary <b>amides</b> with a newly discovered catalyst system was studied and the important features of this ligand were identified. Our final study was devoted to providing a mechanistic rationale that explains the experimental observations of Pd-catalyzed y-arylation reactions. A novel mechanism for reductive elimination was identified and calculated to be the operative pathway. Chapter 5. Development of a Method for the Pd-Catalyzed Bromination of Aryl Triflates An efficient Pd catalyst was identified for the bromination of aryl triflates using high-throughput screening. A major obstacle to achieving full conversion was catalyst inhibition by the triflate salts formed over the course of the reaction. A solution to this problem was discovered, which involved the sequestration of these salts by the addition of a trialkylaluminum Lewis acid. This interaction was characterized by calorimetric studies, showing that triflate-trialkylaluminum binding is very strong. Further work is needed to fully develop this methodology and extend it to forming aryl chlorides. by Alan M. Hyde. Thesis (Ph. D.)
