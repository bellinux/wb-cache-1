A regenerative circuit is often an <b>AM</b> <b>detector,</b> converting the RF signal on the antenna to an audio waveform. Their use of positive feedback greatly increases both the selectivity and sensitivity of a simple receiver. Positive feedback builds up the input signal to very high levels.

5000|$|Demodulation: After {{the radio}} signal is {{filtered}} and amplified, the receiver must extract the information-bearing modulation {{signal from the}} modulated radio frequency carrier wave. This is done by a circuit called a demodulator (detector). Each type of modulation uses a matching type of detector for optimum results; FM, for example, works poorly with an <b>AM</b> <b>detector.</b> Many other types of modulation are also used for specialized purposes. These different types of modulation require different demodulation circuits.|$|E
5000|$|AM {{detectors}} cannot demodulate [...] FM and PM signals {{because both}} have a constant amplitude. However an AM radio may detect {{the sound of an}} FM broadcast by the phenomenon of slope detection which occurs when the radio is tuned slightly above or below the nominal broadcast frequency. Frequency variation on one sloping side of the radio tuning curve gives the amplified signal a corresponding local amplitude variation, to which the <b>AM</b> <b>detector</b> is sensitive. Slope detection gives inferior distortion and noise rejection compared to the following dedicated FM detectors that are normally used.|$|E
5000|$|Since the <b>AM</b> <b>detector</b> diode {{produces}} a DC voltage proportional to signal strength, this {{voltage can be}} fed back to earlier stages of the receiver to reduce gain. A filter network is required so that the audio components of the signal don't appreciably influence gain; this prevents [...] "modulation rise" [...] which increases the effective modulation depth of the signal, distorting the sound. Communications receivers may have more complex AVC systems, including extra amplification stages, separate AGC detector diodes, different time constants for broadcast and shortwave bands, and application of different levels of AGC voltage to different stages of the receiver to prevent distortion and cross-modulation. Design of the AVC system has a great effect on the usability of the receiver, tuning characteristics, audio fidelity, and behavior on overload and strong signals.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{telegraph}} {{and telephone}} systems, which used completely {{different types of}} equipment, most radio receivers were equally suitable for both radiotelegraph and radiotelephone reception. In 1903 and 1904 the electrolytic detector and thermionic diode (Fleming valve) were invented by Reginald Fessenden and John Ambrose Fleming, respectively. Most important, in 1904-1906 the crystal detector, the simplest and cheapest <b>AM</b> <b>detector,</b> was developed by G. W. Pickard. Homemade crystal radios spread rapidly during the next 15 years, providing ready audiences for the first radio broadcasts. One limitation of crystals sets {{was the lack of}} amplifying the signals, so listeners had to use earphones, and it required the development of vacuum-tube receivers before loudspeakers could be used. The dynamic cone loudspeaker, invented in 1924, greatly improved audio frequency response over the previous horn speakers, allowing music to be reproduced with good fidelity. AM radio offered the highest sound quality available in a home audio device prior to the introduction of the high-fidelity, long-playing record in the late 1940s.|$|E

The detector circuit consumes only 0. 39 mW, which is almost a tenfold improvement over previous works in the same technology and crucial for mobile and wearable applications. At the same time it has the smallest chip area. The detector provides a conversion gain of 20. 3 dB and an RF - 3 dB-bandwidth of around 7. 5 MHz.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1995 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaThis {{paper will}} discuss the {{performance}} of pulse code modulation (PCM) /frequency modulation (FM) during frequency selective fading. Frequency selective fading occurs when the attenuation in part of the frequency band of interest {{is much greater than}} {{in the rest of the}} band of interest. The frequency selective fading model used in this paper assumes that two paths with different delays exist between the transmitter and receiver (multipath). The two-path model was simulated in the laboratory and the effects of frequency selective fading on the radio frequency (RF) spectrum and on the waveforms at the output of the FM demodulator were measured. A mathematical model was also used to predict the effects of frequency selective fading. The predicted waveshapes are compared with the laboratory data. A simple demodulator which alleviates the effects of frequency selective fading on PCM/FM at moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) will be described. This demodulator is created by detuning the telemetry receiver by a frequency equal to approximately one-half of the intermediate frequency (IF) bandwidth and using the receiver’s amplitude modulation (<b>AM)</b> <b>detector</b> output rather than the FM detector output. The performance of this offset AM demodulator will be compared with the performance of an FM demodulator. Frequency selective fades measured in real-world environments will be also presented...|$|E
40|$|Two modern {{cryogenic}} {{variants of}} the Pound circuit {{have been devised}} to increase the frequency stability of microwave oscillators that include cryogenic sapphire-filled cavity resonators. The original Pound circuit is a microwave frequency discriminator that provides feedback to stabilize a voltage-controlled microwave oscillator with respect to an associated cavity resonator. In the present cryogenic Pound circuits, the active microwave devices are implemented by use of state-of-the-art commercially available tunnel diodes that exhibit low flicker noise (required for high frequency stability) and function well at low temperatures and at frequencies up to several tens of gigahertz. While tunnel diodes are inherently operable as amplitude detectors and amplitude modulators, they cannot, by themselves, induce significant phase modulation. Therefore, each of the present cryogenic Pound circuits includes passive circuitry that transforms the AM into the required PM. Each circuit also contains an <b>AM</b> <b>detector</b> {{that is used to}} sample the microwave signal at the input terminal of the high-Q resonator for the purpose of verifying the desired AM null at this point. Finally, each circuit contains a Pound signal detector that puts out a signal, at the modulation frequency, having an amplitude proportional to the frequency error in the input signal. High frequency stability is obtained by processing this output signal into feedback to a voltage-controlled oscillator to continuously correct the frequency error in the input signal...|$|E
