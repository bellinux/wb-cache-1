5|$|A {{number of}} factors made escape {{attempts}} daunting for the internees. They would have to navigate through Japanese-occupied territory, find food, and as few internees spoke Cantonese, they {{would also have to}} deal with the language barrier if they succeeded in escaping. Despite these difficulties, there were three major escape <b>attempts,</b> <b>of</b> which two in March 1942 were successful. One group of eight internees escaped on a small boat to neighbouring Macau. Another group, consisting of two internees, escaped through the New Territories and into mainland China. The third group, four policemen, in April 1942 managed to escape the camp grounds but were caught within a few miles of camp. They were subsequently imprisoned and released back to camp after a few weeks.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1140, Theobald consecrated Uhtred as Bishop of Llandaff, with Uhtred also {{swearing}} to obey Theobald. Likewise, when Theobald consecrated Gilbert as Bishop of St Asaph in 1142, {{a similar}} profession of obedience was made. Along with these consecrations, Theobald's legal efforts {{enabled him to}} withstand the <b>attempts</b> <b>of</b> Bernard to turn St David's into an archbishopric, and when Bernard was succeeded by David fitzGerald in 1148, Theobald secured the new bishop's profession of obedience to Canterbury, thus ending the efforts to remove Wales from Canterbury's jurisdiction. Also in 1148, Pope Eugene decided in favour of Canterbury and against the claims of St David's, securing Canterbury's jurisdiction over Wales.|$|E

Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted assault. However, it is possible to commit <b>attempts</b> <b>of</b> aggravated forms of assault.|$|E

5|$|Despite the <b>attempts</b> <b>of</b> the Kirk {{to limit}} the {{tradition}} of secular popular music, it continued. This period saw {{the adoption of the}} highland bagpipes and the fiddle. Ballads, some of which probably date from the Medieval period, existed as part of an distinctive oral tradition. Allan Ramsey advocated the creation of a national musical tradition and collaborated with Italian composer and cellist Lorenzo Bocchi on the first Scottish opera the Gentle Shepherd. A musical culture developed around Edinburgh and a number of composers began to produce collections of Lowland and Highland tunes grafted on to Italian musical forms. By the middle of the eighteenth century a number of Italian musicians and composers were resident in Scotland and Scottish composers of national significance had begun to emerge.|$|E
