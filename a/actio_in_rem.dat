50|$|Ius in re, or jus in re, under civil law, more {{commonly}} referred to as a real right or right in rem, is a right in property, known as an interest under common law. A real right vests in a person with respect to property, inherent in his relation to it, and is good against the world (erga omnes). The primary real right is ownership (dominium) (freehold, leasehold, commonhold). Whether possession (possessio) is recognized as a real right, or merely as a source of certain powers and actions, depends on the legal system at hand. Subordinate or limited real rights generally refer to encumbrances, rights of use and security interests. The term right in rem is derived from the action given to its holder, an <b>actio</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem.</b> In Latin grammar the action against the thing demands a fourth case. The underlying right itself, Ius in re, has a fifth case, as the right rests on, or burdens, the thing. By mistake the common law terminology now uses the fourth case for describing the right itself. Compare jus ad rem.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{a phenomenon}} of injunctions against innocent third parties (in a tort law sense). One type of such injunctions, website blocking, is currently appearing in a spotlight around various European jurisdictions {{as a consequence of}} the implementation of Art. 8 (3) of the Information Society Directive and Art. 11 of the Enforcement Directive. Website blocking injunctions are in this paper used only as a plastic and perhaps also canonical example of the paradigmatic shift we are facing. The shift from tort law centric injunctions to in rem injunctions. Author of this paper maintains that the theoretical framework for latter injunctions is not in the law of civil wrongs, but in an old Roman law concept of so called 'in rem actions' (<b>actio</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> negatoria). Thus the term in rem injunctions is coined to describe this concept of injunctions. Besides the theoretical foundations, the paper explains how system of injunctions against innocent parties fits into the private law regulation of negative externalities of on-line technology and also what are expected dangers of derailing injunctions from the tracks of the tort law. The important question of the justification of an extension of the intellectual property entitlements by in rem paradigm, it's limits or other solutions to it however, which is author's PhD project, is left out from the paper...|$|E
40|$|The legis <b>actio</b> sacramento <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> {{belongs to}} the most debated issues of {{specialised}} literature on Roman Law {{up to the present}} day. The literature on the subject would fill a whole library, only its approximative treatment would require a separate monography. When explaining the origins of the legis <b>actio</b> sacramento <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> one can distinguish several, more or less clearly isolated trends. The present study will regard the theory of oath and the theory of personal fight as the two most important. The fundamentally sacred character of the legis actio sacramento is emphasised by the theory of oath, according to which the principal aim of communal control could be the expiatio of the divinity retaliating the perjury, the sacramentum of the defeated party. This theory is also corroborated by the text of the vindicatio, appearing as the strictly formalised, religious-magical carmen. Although it is much older, the theory of personal fight is traced back to Jhering, and its essence is that in the beginning the parties actually fought against each other for the thing constituting the object of their controversy, but the community (the state), in order to preserve internal peace, brought the fight under its own control. Therefore, the fight, {{in the form of the}} legis <b>actio</b> sacramento <b>in</b> <b>rem,</b> as it is known today was enacted only symbolically, by employing the rod (festuca) instead of the spear (hasta). The aim of the present study is merely to highlight a possibility-based mainly on the primary sources and partly on the findings of the literature on the subject-which will not consider the motifs of sacrality and private fight contradictory in the structure of the legis <b>actio</b> sacramento <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> but will mingle them as organically complementing components...|$|R

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{recovering}} a paid amount within the insured sum, however, {{in addition to the}} owed amount, the insurer sues his client for claims. Does the insurer have, to this end, a cleared way towards unjust enrichment? The provisions of the 1864 Civil Code do not contain definitions of ex contractu and <b>actio</b> de <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> verso. The doctrine has established the acceptability requirements of <b>actio</b> de <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> verso, however, it did not do the same for ex contractu, and there is no notable change to this matter after the Civil Code became effective. This situation is also maintained in the current Law No. 287 / 2009 on the Civil Code. Hence, the separation of the configuration and enforcement area of the two types of actions continues to be done in terms of jurisprudence by strictly relating to the case at hand. The study starts from an actual case the settling of which highlights the issue of determining the subsidiary nature, hence the acceptability of the unjust enrichment. The {{purpose of this study is}} to re/focus on an old dichotomy, i. e. the contract-based action (ex contractu) and the action based on an licit deed, that of unjust enrichment (<b>actio</b> de <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> verso). The primary goal of the study consists of highlighting the aspects that the provisions of the 1864 Civil Code and those of the new Civil Code have in common or not in terms of the two types of actions before the court, the doctrine-related solutions given as concerns the characteristics and legal status of the two actions and the fact that, in the nex Civil Code as well, the separation line between the two actions is determined on the basis of jurisprudence, being left at the judges' discretion and wisdom, with all related consequences thereof...|$|R
40|$|In his {{well-known}} {{description of}} legis <b>actio</b> sacramento <b>in</b> <b>rem,</b> Gaius remarks that the rod {{was used in}} the procedure instead of the spear as the sign of lawful property since what the Romans considered truly their own was the goods taken from the enemy: “ Festuca autem utebantur quasi hastae loco, signo quodam iusti dominii; quod maxime sua esse credebant quae ex hostibus cepissent. ” In harmony with Gaius’s view Verrius Festus states that the spear is the symbol, incarnation of supreme power: “ Hasta summa armorum et imperii est. ” Setting out from these two testimonia, in the present study we intend to examine the content of the hasta and the festuca as symbols of power to support the interpretation of the ritual of legis <b>actio</b> sacramento <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> as duellum sacrum. First, we shall give a brief account of the occurrences of the spear as the symbol of imperium, of subhastatio related thereto and the function of the supreme commander’s spear; also, we shall touch on the stick of augures and certain Greek prefigurations and parallels of the symbolic nature of the spear and the rod. (I.) After that, we shall make some statements concerning the spear of the god Mars and the Mars cult, and the relation of Quirinus and Quirites to the symbolism of the spear. (II.) The fasces carried by lictores proceeding in front of the magistratus, the flamen Dialis and the virgo Vestalis are also insignia of power and, as we try to highlight this point, incamate the highly sacralised, numinous nature of power.

To that effect, a brief historical review of these principles is performed; their notions, requirements, and functional conditions established by jurisprudence are revised; and finally, the current stance of the Administrative Court on the implementation of the unjust enrichment thesis and the merits of the <b>actio</b> de <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> verso <b>in</b> terms of Government liability in the abovementioned events is pointed out...|$|R
40|$|According to Gaius, {{the form}} of the 2 ̆ 7 legis <b>actio</b> sacramento <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> 2 ̆ 7 was as follows: A. Hunc ego hominem ex iure quiritium meum esse aio secundum suam causam.

Uz „vezivanje“ dužnika, nectere, u rimskom pravu se već u najstarije doba javlja i realno osiguranje tražbine - fiducia cum creditore, o kojoj je riječ u radu. Autor ukazuje na pokazatelje u izvorima koji upućuju na arhaično porijeklo fiducije, smještajući je u okvire Zakonika dvanaest ploča, te se osvrće na indicije o mogućoj pravnoj zaštiti fiducijarne mancipacije, kao osnovu uvjetnog, relativnog vlasništva, unutar legisakcionog postupka. The {{historical}} {{development of the}} Roman law of securities was definitely changed {{in the course of}} the 4 th Century BC with the enactment of Lex Poetelia Papiria de nexis, turning from the personal security, nexum, and consequential execution, to the real security, with fiducia as its first form. Formal conveyance of the ownership, and the elements of its restriction, in connection with the related institutes in the Family Law and the Law of Wills, despite the scarce evidence for the age of ius civile, point to its archaic origin. The object of this article is to examine available sources, indices, and the use of formal “fidi fiduciae” clause, concluding that in the scope of Leges duodecim tabularum, legal confirmation of fiducia existed in Tab. VI, I. Resulting from that conclusion follows the question of the legal protection of fiducia. Even though the prevailing opinion denies the possibility that fiducia became actionable before the introduction of the formulary process, its incorporation in the nuncupatio, and formal obligation on remancipatio, suggest certain form of legal protection. In author’s view, this protection did not have to be realized through specific legis actio, but accepting the formal part of Kaser’s theory of “Relatives Eigentum”, with “stronger” causa vindicandi, mancipio dans, after the purpose was fulfilled, would succeed in the process legis <b>actio</b> sacramento <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> as a result of his restored, conditional ownership...|$|R

40|$|This Article closely {{examines}} the rationale offered {{for the new}} quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction, and concludes that it cannot withstand careful analysis. Courts have explained that the new theory of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction is necessary to fill gaps in the state 2 ̆ 7 s long arm statute. However, gaps in a long arm statute can be filled by legislative amendments which can provide in personam jurisdiction up to the full extent permitted by due process. In fact, long arm statutes have steadily expanded {{over the last decade}} to take up the slack left by Shaffer. In personam jurisdiction under a long arm statute is far preferable to the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction. Indeed, given its reliance on attachment, its limited res judicata effect, and its vague and uncertain standards, the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction may very well be unconstitutional and is surely bad policy. Moreover, {{the manner in which the}} new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction has been unilaterally forged by courts violates separation of powers. This Article argues, therefore, that state courts should not succumb to the temptation to embrace the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction, and that it should be repudiated in New York and the other states that follow it. This Article is divided into three parts. Part I discusses the development of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction, and {{examines the}} Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Shaffer. Part II surveys the use of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction <b>in</b> the states since Shaffer. It traces and analyzes the growth of the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction doctrine, considers the causes of this development, and contrasts the new doctrine with the developments in the large majority of states that have not used quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction since Shaffer. Part III considers the contemporary validity of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction, and demonstrates that it is no longer a valid jurisdictional device. The Article concludes that the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction threatens to resuscitate a doctrine that, after honorable service, deserves retirement...|$|R
