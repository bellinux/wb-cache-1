5|$|Camouflage is {{a common}} {{defensive}} mechanism in frogs. Most camouflaged frogs are nocturnal; during the day, they seek out <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> can blend into the background and remain undetected. Some frogs have the , but this is usually restricted to a small range of colours. For example, White's tree frog (Litoria caerulea) varies between pale green and dull brown according to the temperature, and the Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla) has green and brown morphs, plain or spotted, and changes colour depending {{on the time of}} year and general background colour. Features such as warts and skin folds are usually on ground-dwelling frogs, for whom smooth skin would not provide such effective camouflage. Certain frogs change colour between night and day, as light and moisture stimulate the pigment cells and cause them to expand or contract.|$|E
5|$|Next, {{the train}} passes through two {{consecutive}} horseshoe turns, {{first to the}} right and then to the left. As the name suggests, Horseshoe turns are highly banked horseshoe-shaped turns which feature track entering from roughly the same direction as where it exits. As the train exits the second horseshoe, it swoops down and begins a 270-degree helix to the right, which leads into the ride's second inversion, an inline twist. The inline twist sees riders perform a full rotation around the track, starting from <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> are facing downward. After completing the twist, the train reaches the brake run and a final right-hand turn that leads back into the station.|$|E
25|$|Several turtle {{species and}} the frogmouth catfish have tongue {{extensions}} that lure prey to <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> become an easy catch. In caudal luring the predator uses tail movements to attract prey. This form of mimicry {{is used by}} several snake and lizard species, as well by as the tasselled wobbegong shark.|$|E
50|$|Epiblepharon is characterised by a {{congenital}} horizontal fold of skin {{near the}} margin of the upper or lower eyelid caused by the abnormal insertion of muscle fibres. This extra fold of skin redirects the lashes into <b>a</b> vertical <b>position,</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> may contact the globe. This is found most commonly in Asian individuals, especially children.|$|R

25|$|He scored 20 and 17 on debut against Sussex, but {{his best}} match was his second, against Glamorgan at Cardiff Arms Park. He scored 32 and 35 not out, {{in the first}} innings putting on 91 with Harry Higgins to bring Worcestershire from 43/4 up to <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were able to record a 44-run victory. In the six {{remaining}} innings of his first-class career, however, he made only ten runs, being dismissed for 0, 5, 1, 0, 4 and 0.|$|E
25|$|England's second innings started well, {{with the}} openers putting on 158 {{for the first}} wicket. Andrew Strauss went on to score 116, and Chris Read scored 55 down the order, but the other wickets fell quite {{regularly}} as England attempted to set up <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> could push for a win {{on the final day}}. Pakistan's bowling attack shared the wickets between them, and eventually bowled England out for 345. Pakistan needed 323 runs on the final day to win.|$|E

50|$|During the Aleutians fighting, Eareckson was {{famed for}} his {{innovative}} tactics.

25|$|The Sydney Roosters {{entered the}} Grand Final from a {{markedly}} different path {{to that of}} the Dragons. The Roosters had finished the 2009 season {{on the bottom of the}} ladder. Under new coach Brian Smith, and having signed troubled star Todd Carney, the Roosters improved to finish sixth on the ladder in 2010, before consecutive finals series victories against the Wests Tigers, the Penrith Panthers and the Gold Coast Titans launched the club into the Grand Final. The Roosters were thus in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> could become the first club since the Western Suburbs Magpies in 1934 to win a premiership after finishing last in the previous season.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} historian William Siborne postulates {{that the}} outcome of Quatre Bras and Ligny put the two Coalition armies in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> could unite after the concentration of each army had been accomplished; hitherto, they had been compelled to meet their opponents before they had succeeded in collecting their respective forces. If, however, Wellington {{had been unable to}} maintain his ground against Ney, and Napoleon had in this manner succeeded in beating both armies in detail; or, if the Prussian defeat had been followed up by a vigorous pursuit, the loss of the Battle of Ligny might have placed both armies in a critical position.|$|E
25|$|The Beothuks {{attempted}} to avoid Europeans in Newfoundland by moving from their traditional settlements. First they {{attempted to}} move to different coastal areas of Newfoundland where the Europeans did not have fishing camps set up, but soon they were so overrun {{that they had to}} move into inland Newfoundland. The Beothuks' main food sources were traditionally caribou, fish and seals, but their forced migration inland deprived them of two of these. This led to the over-hunting of caribou to survive, which soon led to a decrease in the caribou population in Newfoundland. The Beothuks were put into <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were forced from their traditional land and lifestyle into ecosystems that could not support them and that led to undernourishment and eventually starvation.|$|E

25|$|Legal {{constraints}} on recreational diving vary considerably across jurisdictions. In many countries recreational diving is either not mentioned {{at all in}} laws and regulations, or specifically excluded from regulations covering occupational diving. In others, only diver training and dive-leading activities where the diver is either employed or takes <b>a</b> leadership <b>position</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> {{are responsible for the}} safety of others is covered by legislation. At the other extreme, countries such as Israel have statutory law covering all recreational diving activities.|$|R

Long was wounded and retreated. Harrison was killed, dying {{as a result of}} his wounds before he was able to relay who shot him to anyone else.|$|R
25|$|Other common {{styles of}} {{clothing}} popularly worn with a niqab in Western countries include the khimar, a semi-circular flare of fabric with {{an opening for}} the face and a small triangular underscarf. A khimar is usually bust-level or longer, and can also be worn without the niqab. It is considered a fairly easy form of headscarf to wear, as there are no pins or fasteners; it is simply pulled over the head. Gloves are also sometimes worn with the niqab, because many munaqqabāt believe {{no part of the}} skin should be visible other than the area immediately around the eyes or because {{they do not want to}} be put in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> would touch the hand of an unrelated man (for instance, when accepting change from a cashier). Most munaqqabāt also wear an overgarment (jilbab, abaya etc.) over their clothing, though some munaqabat in Western countries wear a long, loose tunic and skirt instead of a one-piece overgarment.|$|E
25|$|After {{a lengthy}} wait, Charles persuaded his generals that English Jacobites would stage an {{uprising}} {{in support of}} his cause. He was convinced that France would launch an invasion of England as well. His army of around 5,000 invaded England on 8 November 1745. They advanced through Carlisle and Manchester to Derby and <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> appeared to threaten London. It is often alleged that King George II made plans to decamp to Hanover, but there is no evidence for this and the King is on record as stating that he would lead the troops against the rebels himself if they approached London. (George had experience at the head of an army: in 1743 he had led his soldiers to victory at the Battle of Dettingen, becoming the last British monarch to lead troops into battle.) The Jacobites met only token resistance. There was, however, little support from English Jacobites, and the French invasion fleet was still being assembled. The armies of Field Marshal George Wade and of William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, were approaching. In addition to the militia, London was defended by nearly 6,000 infantry, 700 horse and 33 artillery pieces and the Jacobites received false reports of a third army closing on them. The Jacobite general, Lord George Murray, and the Council of War insisted on returning to join their growing force in Scotland. On 6 December 1745, they withdrew, with Charles Edward Stuart leaving command to Murray.|$|E

50|$|Bruguiera gymnorhiza (black {{mangrove}}, Swart-wortelboom, Isikhangati, Isihlobane) is a {{small tree}} up to 10 m high that belongs to the family Rhizophoraceae. It is found on the seaward side of mangrove swamps, often {{in the company of}} Rhizophora. Its bark is rough and reddish brown. The tree develops short prop-roots rather than long stilt-roots. Flowers are creamy white soon turning brown. The sepals are persistent, narrow and slightly tapered.

50|$|Immigrant {{and refugee}} women often face violence, {{both in the}} private sphere (by {{partners}} and other family members) and {{in the public sphere}} (by the police and other authorities).

500|$|McCarthy {{argued that}} the rules already {{prohibited}} strikes {{to the back of}} the head and questioned if it was just the 12-6 elbow strike that was the problem. Following this discussion, Nick Lembo wrote the Unified Rules, including a rule prohibiting downward elbow strikes. McCarthy felt that Lembo wrote the rule relating to downward elbow strikes [...] "poorly" [...] as he felt the definition was broad and left the rule open to interpretation. Pride eventually did not adopt the Unified Rules; however, their ruleset prohibited any elbow strikes to the head. Eventually the rule on 12-6 elbows meant that very few fighters attempted them, which could also be attributed to the fact that it is difficult for fighters to get into <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> could use them.|$|E
500|$|Owing to a {{combination}} of favourable factors, Fraser decided on 1 April to bring the raid on Kaafjord forward by 24 hours. Decrypted German signals indicated that Tirpitzs trials had been delayed until 3 April, and Fraser hoped that an attack on this date would catch the battleship away from her usual well-protected mooring. Moreover, as JW 58's escorts were performing well and there was no indication that Tirpitz would sortie into the open sea, Fraser judged that Force One no longer needed to provide support for the transports. Weather conditions were also unusually good for the Norwegian Sea in early Spring and were well suited to flying operations. After the decision to attack was made both tankers and two escorting destroyers detached from Force Two and proceeded to a point [...] north-west of Kaafjord where they remained to supply any destroyers that ran low on fuel. The rest of Force Two altered course to rendezvous with Force One, and this was achieved at 4:20 pm on 2 April. After the two forces met Duke of York, with Fraser on board, and two destroyers sailed to the north-west and took up <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> would be able to intercept Tirpitz in the event that she had sailed from Kaafjord without being detected. The remainder of the Home Fleet proceeded to the strike's launching point.|$|E

50|$|Although the 2005 {{decision}} has spurred some watchmakers {{to invest in}} the personnel and equipment necessary to produce movements in-house, heavy reliance on ETA continues to the present day.

50|$|Lochiel was frank {{about his}} lack of {{military}} experience and deferred to Lord George Murray's judgement on such strategy and tactics, but he quickly showed {{himself to be a}} capable commander who led from the front.
