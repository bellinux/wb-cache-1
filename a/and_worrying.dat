In World War II Victoria was bombed out of Kensington Palace, and {{spent some time}} at Windsor Castle with King George VI. Her surviving son, Louis, and two of her grandsons served in the Royal Navy, while her German relations fought with the opposing forces. She {{spent most of her}} time reading <b>and</b> <b>worrying</b> about her children; her daughter, Alice, remained in occupied Greece and was unable to communicate with her mother for four years {{at the height of the}} war. After the Allied victory, her son, Louis, was offered the post of Viceroy of India, but she was deeply opposed to his accepting, knowing that the position would be dangerous and difficult. He accepted anyway.|$|E

Soon after, two Spitfires appeared out of the clouds and opened fire on both Beaufighters. Jackson's damaged aircraft made it back to Coltishall, but Downing's aircraft crashed into the sea, killing all aboard.|$|E

50|$|Measures of {{rumination}} <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> {{have also}} demonstrated high correlations, {{above and beyond}} that of symptom measures of anxiety and depression (r=.66; Beck & Perkins, 2001). Rumination <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> overlap in their relationships to anxiety and depression, although some studies do indicate specificity of rumination to depression <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> to anxiety. Rumination {{has been found to}} predict changes in both depression and anxiety symptoms and individuals with major depression have been reported to engage in levels of worry similar to individuals with GAD. As a whole, these studies suggest that rumination <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> are related not only to each other, but also each is related to symptoms of both depression and anxiety.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} has demonstrated the importance of examining the relationships between personality and psychopathology (Krueger 2 ̆ 6 Tackett, 2006). The present investigation sought to further develop this literature. More specifically, the following study examined the links between neuroticism, experiential avoidance, <b>and</b> <b>worry.</b> The focus {{of the current study}} was to replicate and extend previous findings on neuroticism, experiential avoidance, <b>and</b> <b>worry.</b> In addition, a novel mediational model was tested to determine if experiential avoidance is the pathway through which the relationship between neuroticism <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> is transmitted. Results of the study regarding the primary hypotheses were mixed. While experiential avoidance, <b>worry,</b> <b>and</b> neuroticism were all positively correlated as predicted, experiential avoidance did not predict worry after controlling for neuroticism. In addition, experiential avoidance was not found to mediate the relationship between neuroticism <b>and</b> <b>worry.</b> Supplementary analyses found that anxiety, stress, depression, <b>worry,</b> <b>and</b> experiential avoidance were all significantly positively correlated with one another. In addition, it was found that experiential avoidance increased the prediction of a worry after controlling for the effects of anxiety, stress, and depression, and experiential avoidance mediated the relationship between anxiety <b>and</b> <b>worry.</b> Clinical <b>and</b> theoretical implications, strengths and limitations, and future directions for research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} how cognitive determinants and emotional determinants, in particular fears <b>and</b> <b>worries,</b> relate to STI testing behaviour. A {{survey was conducted}} online among 906 participants aged 16 to 26 years who completed a digital questionnaire about sexuality, sexual health, STI testing behaviours and cognitive and emotional factors potentially influencing testing behaviours. The cognitive factors were specified by an extended health belief model (HBM) and encompassed perceived risk and severity of STIs, perceived {{pros and cons of}} STI testing, and perceived behavioural control over STI testing behaviour. Emotional factors referred to fears <b>and</b> <b>worries</b> about STIs <b>and</b> STI testing. All cognitive variables of the extended HBM, as well as fears <b>and</b> <b>worries,</b> were found to be univariately associated with STI testing behaviour. In multivariate analysis, perceived behavioural control was found to add to HBM variables. As predicted the relation between fears <b>and</b> <b>worries</b> <b>and</b> STI testing was mediated by cognitive variables, but only the combination of extended HBM variables reduced the association between fears <b>and</b> <b>worries</b> <b>and</b> STI testing behaviour to non-significance; individual cognitive variables did not significantly mediate this association. Results {{of this study suggest that}} emotions influence cognitions in explaining STI testing behaviour. Fears <b>and</b> <b>worries</b> affect threat perception as well as evaluation of the behaviour, suggesting that threat appraisal and coping appraisal are intricately related and may not work in parallel as suggested by classic social cognitive models. Limitations and implications of the study are discussed...|$|R

2500|$|Forced child begging {{is a type}} of begging {{in which}} boys and girls under the age of {{eighteen}} are forced to beg through psychological and physical coercion. Begging is defined by the Buffalo Human Rights Law Review as [...] "the activity of asking for money as charity on the street". There is evidence to suggest that forced begging is one industry that children are trafficked into, with a recent UNICEF study reporting that 13% of trafficking victims in South Eastern Europe have been trafficked for the purpose of forced begging. The United Nations protocol affirms that [...] "the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered 'trafficking in persons' even if this does not involve any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) of this article." [...] With this definition the transportation of a child to an urban center for the purposes of begging constitutes trafficking regardless of whether this process was enforced by a third party or family member. The severity of this form of trafficking is starting to gain global recognition, with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the European Union, the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the United Nations, among others, beginning to emphasize its pertinence. [...] The European Union's Brussels Declaration on Preventing and Combating Trafficking includes child begging as one form of trafficking, stating [...] "trafficking in human beings is an abhorrent <b>and</b> <b>worrying</b> phenomenon involving coercive sexual exploitation, labor exploitation in conditions akin to slavery, exploitation in begging and juvenile delinquency as well as domestic servitude." [...] This issue is especially difficult to regulate given that forced begging is often imposed by family members, with parental power leveraged over a child to ensure that begging is carried out.|$|E
