5|$|Five {{medications}} {{are currently}} {{used to treat}} the cognitive problems of AD: four are <b>acetylcholinesterase</b> inhibitors (tacrine, rivastigmine, galantamine and donepezil) and the other (memantine) is an NMDA receptor antagonist. The benefit from their use is small. No medication has been clearly shown to delay or halt the progression of the disease.|$|E
5|$|The same triad {{has also}} convergently evolved in α/β hydrolases such as some lipases and esterases, however {{orientation}} of the triad members is reversed. Additionally, brain acetyl hydrolase (which has the same fold as a small G-protein) has also {{been found to have}} this triad. The equivalent Serine-Histidine-Glutamate triad is used in <b>acetylcholinesterase.</b>|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are found}} in nature and are also {{designed}} and produced as part of pharmacology and biochemistry. Natural poisons are often enzyme inhibitors that have evolved to defend a plant or animal against predators. These natural toxins include {{some of the most}} poisonous compounds known. Artificial inhibitors are often used as drugs, but can also be insecticides such as malathion, herbicides such as glyphosate, or disinfectants such as triclosan. Other artificial enzyme inhibitors block <b>acetylcholinesterase,</b> an enzyme which breaks down acetylcholine, and are used as nerve agents in chemical warfare.|$|E
40|$|Cholinesterases were {{detected}} in protoscolices of Echinococcus granulosus spectrophotometrically and electrophoretically. To characterize these activities as <b>acetylcholinesterases</b> or pseudocholinesterases, BW 284 C 51 and the organophosphate anthelmintic Neguvón® were assayed as specific inhibitors of <b>acetylcholinesterases,</b> while Iso-OMPA was employed as specific inhibitor of pseudocholinesterases. We concluded that these Cholinesterase (ChE) activities {{would be considered}} as possible targets in chemotherapy...|$|R

5|$|Many natural poisons act as {{neurotoxins}} {{that can}} cause paralysis leading to death and have functions for defence against predators or in hunting and capturing prey. Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, are valuable for therapeutic uses at lower doses. An example of a neurotoxin are the glycoalkaloids, from the plant species in the Solanaceae family (includes potato, tomato and eggplant), that are <b>acetylcholinesterase</b> inhibitors. Inhibition of this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, muscular paralysis and then death. Neurotoxicity can also result from the inhibition of receptors; for example, atropine from deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) that functions as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
5|$|Reduction in the {{activity}} of the cholinergic neurons is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease. <b>Acetylcholinesterase</b> inhibitors are employed to reduce the rate at which acetylcholine (ACh) is broken down, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh in the brain and combating the loss of ACh caused by the death of cholinergic neurons. There is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage. Only donepezil is approved for treatment of advanced AD dementia. The use of these drugs in mild cognitive impairment has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of AD. The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, both of which are linked to cholinergic excess. These side effects arise in approximately 10–20% of users, are mild to moderate in severity, and can be managed by slowly adjusting medication doses. Less common secondary effects include muscle cramps, decreased heart rate (bradycardia), decreased appetite and weight, and increased gastric acid production.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray and its relatives {{are used as}} model organisms for biomedical research, because their electric organs contain an abundance of important nervous system proteins such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and <b>acetylcholinesterase.</b> In the 1970s and 1980s, acetylcholine receptors from this species and the marbled {{electric ray}} (T.marmorata) became the first neurotransmitter receptors to be isolated and sequenced, in what {{is considered to be}} a landmark success in the field of neurobiology. This led to a number of further advances, one of the most significant being the elucidation of the pathophysiology underlying the disease myasthenia gravis. A small commercial fishery in southern California supplies Pacific electric rays for research purposes; as of 2005 this fishery may have employed as few as two fishers. Otherwise, this ray has no economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries, and on hook-and-line by sport anglers. These activities appear to have little impact on its population, leading it to be listed under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Fishing for this ray is not managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council.|$|E
50|$|The {{extracellular}} {{domain of}} NLGN consists mostly {{of a region}} that is homologous to <b>acetylcholinesterases,</b> but the amino acids important for catalysis in AChE are not conserved in NLGN, which lack esterase activity. Furthermore, this AChE homologous region is crucial for the proper function of NLGN.|$|R
40|$|Motivation: The {{catalytic}} {{properties of}} enzymes, containing the ASP-HIS-SER triads are deeply investigated {{for a long}} time. Serine endopeptidases, cutinases, <b>acetylcholinesterases,</b> cellulases contain these triads. We found that solely the geometric properties of just four points in the spatial structure of these enzymes are characteristic to their family. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen great {{progress}} in the purification and characterization of cholinesterases. Investigation has indicated the existence of two principal groups: a fairly homogeneous group of <b>acetylcholinesterases</b> {{and a group of}} enzymes that utilize butyrylcholine, propionycholine, or benzoylcholine as substrates and that differ widely in their properties...|$|R
5|$|The {{efficiency}} of an enzyme {{can be expressed}} in terms of kcat/Km. This is also called the specificity constant and incorporates the rate constants for all steps in the reaction up to and including the first irreversible step. Because the specificity constant reflects both affinity and catalytic ability, it is useful for comparing different enzymes against each other, or the same enzyme with different substrates. The theoretical maximum for the specificity constant is called the diffusion limit and is about 108 to 109 (M−1 s−1). At this point every collision of the enzyme with its substrate will result in catalysis, and the rate of product formation is not limited by the reaction rate but by the diffusion rate. Enzymes with this property are called catalytically perfect or kinetically perfect. Example of such enzymes are triose-phosphate isomerase, carbonic anhydrase, <b>acetylcholinesterase,</b> catalase, fumarase, β-lactamase, and superoxide dismutase. The turnover of such enzymes can reach several million reactions per second.|$|E
25|$|Rivastigmine, an <b>acetylcholinesterase</b> inhibitor, {{inhibits}} both butyrylcholinesterase and <b>acetylcholinesterase</b> (unlike donepezil, which selectively inhibits <b>acetylcholinesterase).</b> It {{is thought}} to work by inhibiting these cholinesterase enzymes, which would otherwise break down the brain neurotransmitter acetylcholine.|$|E

50|$|Fasciculins from mambas inhibit {{mammalian}} {{and fish}} <b>acetylcholinesterases</b> intensely, but are less active against the corresponding enzymes in insects, reptiles and birds. As {{one might expect}} of fast-acting venoms, they are fairly small proteins of about 61 amino acid residues. Their three-dimensional shape is three-fingered, and is secured by four cross-linking disulfide bridges.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{measured}} in vitro honey bee enzyme activity in presence of the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and some new benzodioxole and dihydrobenzofuran derivatives through absorbance and fluorescence spectrophotometric assays, to determine if {{and to what extent}} detoxification systems and <b>acetylcholinesterases</b> are affected by these compounds. Both Italian (Italy) and Carniolan (Czech Republic) honey bees were tested. In the case of Italian honey bees the esterase activity was partially but significantly inhibited by almost all the tested products. In Carniolan honey bees only the dihydrobenzofuran derivative EN 16 - 41 significantly inhibited esterases. Other enzymatic systems, such as cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases (P 450 s) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), often involved in xenobiotics detoxification, as well as <b>acetylcholinesterases</b> (AchEs) seem not to be targeted by the studied synergists. These data seem to suggest that some of the investigated PBO analogues could not be detrimental to honey bee...|$|R

25|$|The disease {{myasthenia}} gravis, {{characterized by}} muscle weakness and fatigue, {{occurs when the}} body inappropriately produces antibodies against acetylcholine nicotinic receptors, and thus inhibits proper acetylcholine signal transmission. Over time, the motor end plate is destroyed. Drugs that competitively inhibit <b>acetylcholinesterase</b> (e.g., neostigmine, physostigmine, or primarily pyridostigmine) are effective in treating this disorder. They allow endogenously released acetylcholine more time to interact with its respective receptor before being inactivated by <b>acetylcholinesterase</b> in the synaptic cleft (the space between nerve and muscle).|$|E

50|$|It {{is highly}} active {{at all of}} the muscarinic receptors, but has little effect on the nicotinic receptors. Methacholine has a charged {{quaternary}} amine structure, rendering it insoluble to lipid cell membranes. Clinically, this means that it will not cross the blood-brain barrier and has poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. It is broken down at a relatively slow rate within the body, due to its relative resistance to <b>acetylcholinesterases.</b>|$|R

40|$|The sensitivities of <b>acetylcholinesterases</b> (ACHE) {{from the}} {{nematode}} Aphelenchus avenae {{and the house}} fly Musca domestica to various pesticides were compared using a colorimetric assay. ACHE from A. avenae were generally less sensitive than ACHE from M. domestica to inhibition by organophosphorous and carbamate pesticides. Carbamates were somewhat more inhibiting than organophosphorous pesticides to nematode ACHE. In vivo tests with concentrations of various pesticides up to 500 ppm in sand caused less than 100 % mortality of nematodes...|$|R

30|$|With {{respect to}} impact of neural function, one enzyme group of {{interest}} are cholinesterases including <b>acetylcholinesterases</b> (ACHE). Fish brain exhibits ACHE activity {{involved in the}} deactivation of acetylcholin at nerve endings, preventing continuous neuronal firing, which is essential for normal functioning of sensory and neuromuscular systems. Many organophosphate and carbamate pesticides are reported to be effective ACHE inhibitors [23]. Activity measurements of ACHE are carried out spectrophotometrically on fish brain extracts at the University of Avignon according to [24] {{in cooperation with the}} University of Tuebingen.|$|R

To understand physiological roles of the three {{pinewood nematode}} AChEs (BxACE- 1, BxACE- 2, and BxACE- 3), BxACE- 3 in particular, their tissue distribution and inhibition profiles were investigated. Immunohistochemistry revealed that BxACE- 1 and BxACE- 2 were distributed in neuronal tissues. In contrast, BxACE- 3 was detected from some specific tissues and extracted {{without the aid of}} detergent, suggesting its soluble nature unlike BxACE- 1 and BxACE- 2.
