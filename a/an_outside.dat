5|$|After {{allegations}} that the design contractor had inflated costs for the tunnel {{in order to avoid}} sharing the job with <b>an</b> <b>outside</b> tunneling contractor, the long tunnel concept was revived in April 2006. The allegations led to calls for <b>an</b> <b>outside</b> cost estimate to determine more realistic tunnel costs. On May 15, 2006, Virginia Transportation Secretary Pierce R. Homer announced the creation of an advisory panel headed by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The panel had about two months to evaluate options for completing the line through Tysons Corner, with the results presented to the state on July 27, 2006 and published on July 31, 2006.|$|E

In a half-Senate election, most successful candidates would not take their places until 1 July 1976, but the territories' senators, and those filling Field's and Bunton's seats, would assume their seats at once. This gave Labor <b>an</b> <b>outside</b> chance of controlling the Senate, at least until 1 July 1976.|$|E

5|$|Adamle {{was again}} {{one of eight}} Browns chosen for the Pro Bowl after Cleveland's 1951 season, when the team reached the {{championship}} game but lost to the Los Angeles Rams. He was named a first-team All-Pro by United Press International and the New York Daily News after the season, when he had one interception and one fumble recovery. He was used mainly as <b>an</b> <b>outside</b> linebacker in Cleveland's 5-3 defense later in his career, only attempting three rushes in the 1950s. Adamle finished college at Kent State University in 1950, earning a bachelor's degree, and received a master's degree in education from Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 1951.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the crisis}} of the 3rd century was not the {{absolute}} beginning of Rome's decline, it nevertheless did impose a severe strain on the empire as Romans waged war on one another as they had not done since {{the last days of the}} Republic. Within the space of a single century, twenty-seven military officers declared themselves emperors and reigned over parts of the empire for months or days, all but two meeting with a violent end. The time was characterized by a Roman army that was as likely to be attacking itself as it was <b>an</b> <b>outside</b> invader, reaching a low point around 258 AD. Ironically, while it was these usurpations that led to the breakup of the Empire during the crisis, it was the strength of several frontier generals that helped reunify the empire through force of arms.|$|E
5|$|Aside from control interfaces, {{the bridge}} set was {{populated}} with monitors looping animations. Each oval monitor was a rear-projection screen on which super 8mm and 16mm film sequences looped for each special effect. The production acquired 42 films {{for this purpose}} from an Arlington, Virginia-based company, Stowmar Enterprises. Stowmar's footage was exhausted {{only a few weeks}} into filming, and it became clear that new monitor films would be needed faster than <b>an</b> <b>outside</b> supplier could deliver them. Cole, Minor, and another production designer, Rick Sternbach, worked together with Povill to devise faster ways of shooting new footage. Cole and Povill rented an oscilloscope for a day and filmed its distortions. Other loops came from Long Beach Hospital, the University of California at San Diego, and experimental computer labs in New Mexico. In all, over two hundred pieces of monitor footage were created and catalogued into a seven-page listing.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2007–08 season it was learned that former manager Danny Bergara had died. Stockport County {{continued}} their success, despite losing an FA Cup first round replay away to non-League Staines Town on penalties. The early months of 2008 saw Stockport equal a league record of eight consecutive away victories. Approaching the end of the season, they had <b>an</b> <b>outside</b> chance to qualify for promotion automatically but missed out, finishing the season in fourth place. However, after beating Wycombe Wanderers 2–1 on aggregate in the play-off semi-final, Stockport played Rochdale at Wembley in the final, coming from behind to secure a 3–2 victory and earn promotion to League One for the next season.|$|E
5|$|Bills can be {{introduced}} to Parliament {{in a number of}} ways; the Scottish Government can introduce new laws or amendments to existing laws as a bill; a committee of the Parliament can present a bill in one of the areas under its remit; a member of the Scottish Parliament can introduce a bill as a private member; or a private bill can be submitted to Parliament by <b>an</b> <b>outside</b> proposer. Most draft laws are government bills introduced by ministers in the governing party (or parties). Bills pass through Parliament in a number of stages before receiving royal assent, whereupon they become Acts of the Scottish Parliament.|$|E

His lifeless body is discovered lying on the ground outside the house. Though Scully concludes that Mr. Baiocchi died as the result of being pushed out of the window, Mulder discovers evidence suggesting he was pulled out by <b>an</b> <b>outside</b> force.
