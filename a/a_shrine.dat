5|$|The size of {{the plaque}} {{suggests}} it would have belonged in <b>a</b> <b>shrine,</b> possibly {{as an object of}} worship; it was probably set into a mud-brick wall.

5|$|Gods were worshiped in cult temples {{administered}} by priests {{acting on the}} king's behalf. At {{the center of the}} temple was the cult statue in <b>a</b> <b>shrine.</b> Temples were not places of public worship or congregation, and only on select feast days and celebrations was <b>a</b> <b>shrine</b> carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship. Normally, the god's domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes, and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos. After the New Kingdom, the pharaoh's role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods. As a result, priests developed a system of oracles to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people.|$|E

Such <b>a</b> Shinto <b>shrine</b> was affected by the Yoshida Shinto and was formed in the early modern times from an end in the middle ages. It was the thing which suggested the possibility that there were the people who took the disposal of the placenta in <b>a</b> Shinto <b>shrine.</b> In Hachiman faith, I was considered in particular to be the day of the festival on a birthday. The story of the birthday of Hachiman god had an expanse, and the participation of the people whom there was around Iwashimizu Hachiman shrine was thought about.
