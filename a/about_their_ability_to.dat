The Warriors were designed by Watts as 40-gun armoured frigates and were not intended {{to stand in the}} line of battle, as the Admiralty was uncertain <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> withstand concentrated fire from wooden two- and three-deck ships of the line. Unlike Gloire, they were planned to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought to their own advantage. In contrast to Gloires square profile, Warrior has a clipper bow, but she is twice as long as a typical clipper ship.|$|E

If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> answer questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E

None of these systems had the capability to provide early warning of a launch, within seconds or minutes of a launch, which would give the defences time to study the attack and plan a response.

Self-efficacy is associated with the anticipated level of attainment required and with the strength of one’s belief that that level of attainment is achievable. As such, it differs from self-confidence, which refers only to the strength of a belief in one’s ability.|$|R

If cochleae are less sensible, speech becomes inaudible. Mere amplification, as provided by hearing aids, restores audibility. But in general HI still perform less even when speech is presented well above their hearing thresholds, giving rise to the idea that impaired cochleae distort speech...|$|R

While initially thrilled at being given extra time to complete their outfits, the designers are dismayed to discover that they must create a second outfit: lingerie. During judging, the judges praise Sunny's suit for its unique perspective, beautiful lines and tailoring, admire Jason's jacket, fault Jessica for the poor tailoring around the shoulders, and fault Genevieve for her dated design and poor tailoring.

[...] The book that followed Yeats, The Anxiety of Influence, which Bloom had started writing in 1967, drew upon the example of Walter Jackson Bate's The Burden of the Past and The English Poet and recast in systematic psychoanalytic form Bate's historicized account of the despair felt by seventeenth- and eighteenth-century poets <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> match the achievements of their predecessors.

Butters speaks with a mild stutter and tends to fidget with his hands. The other characters perceive him as [...] "nerdy", and he obliviously maintains a wholesome attitude and mild disposition despite the tragedy and abuse that he frequently encounters.

Stone describes him as embodying [...] "permanent innocence". [...] Butters, however, sees himself as a problem child because his parents tell him so and often expresses remorse at being [...] "out-of-control". Exceptions to this include the episode [...] "The Ungroundable", in which Butters makes his parents worry <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> ground him when he refuses to be punished. This rebellious behavior begins after he joins the vampire kids at his school, but ends when he helps the Goth kids burn down a Hot Topic store. He is also known for being gullible, quickly believing anything told to him by others and tending to do whatever he is told to do with little protest, no matter how ridiculous these things seem to be. As such, he is always made an unknowing accomplice in Cartman's various devious schemes. There are cases, however, where Butters has shown a darker side, such as in episodes like [...] "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs" [...] and [...] "Butterballs"; in the latter of which he viciously assaulted Dr. Oz and verbally castigated his abusive grandmother.|$|E

Our goal is to present results of the research which was focused on determination of the relation between teachers’ self-efficacy and the factors related with the education of socially disadvantaged pupils.
