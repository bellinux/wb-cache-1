5|$|Canadian {{visual art}} has been {{dominated}} by figures such as Tom Thomson – the country's most famous painter – and by the Group of Seven. Thomson's career painting Canadian landscapes spanned a decade up to his death in 1917 at age 39. The Group were painters with a nationalistic and idealistic focus, who first exhibited their distinctive works in May 1920. Though referred to as having seven members, five artists—Lawren Harris, A. Y. Jackson, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Frederick Varley—were responsible for <b>articulating</b> <b>the</b> Group's ideas. They were joined briefly by Frank Johnston, and by commercial artist Franklin Carmichael. A. J. Casson became part of the Group in 1926. Associated with the Group was another prominent Canadian artist, Emily Carr, known for her landscapes and portrayals of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. Since the 1950s, works of Inuit art have been given as gifts to foreign dignitaries by the Canadian government.|$|E

25|$|Gustav Fechner began {{conducting}} psychophysics {{research in}} Leipzig in the 1830s, <b>articulating</b> <b>the</b> principle that human {{perception of a}} stimulus varies logarithmically according to its intensity. Fechner's 1860 Elements of Psychophysics challenged Kant's stricture against quantitative study of the mind. In Heidelberg, Hermann von Helmholtz conducted parallel research on sensory perception, and trained physiologist Wilhelm Wundt. Wundt, in turn, came to Leipzig University, establishing the psychological laboratory which brought experimental psychology to the world. Wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components, motivated in part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry, and its successful investigation of the elements and structure of material. Paul Flechsig and Emil Kraepelin soon created another influential psychology laboratory at Leipzig, this one focused on more on experimental psychiatry.|$|E

500|$|Pronunciation is {{conceptualized}} as shaping {{the throat and}} mouth into the shape necessary to produce the desired vowel sound, and clearly <b>articulating</b> <b>the</b> initial consonant. There are four basic shapes for the throat and mouth, corresponding to four vowel types, and five methods of articulating consonants, one {{for each type of}} consonant. The four throat and mouth shapes are [...] "opened-mouth" [...] (kaikou), [...] "level-teeth" [...] (qichi), [...] "closed-mouth" [...] (hekou or huokou), and [...] "scooped-lips" [...] (cuochun). The five consonant types are denoted by the portion of the mouth most critical to each type's production: throat, or larynx (hou); tongue (she); molars, or the jaws and palate (chi); front teeth (ya); and lips (chun).|$|E
500|$|The DLM {{actively}} {{participated in}} the 2005 Independence Intifada(Cedar Revolution), a so-called colour revolution in which hundreds of thousands rallied against the Syrian occupation of Lebanon and its supporters in the Lebanese government. As the only leftist, nonsectarian element in the demonstrations, the DLM proved important for the opposition's public relations. Following the resignation of pro-Syrian Prime Minister Omar Karami {{in a wave of}} demonstrations, DLM leader Elias Atallah is quoted as saying, [...] "Today the government fell. Tomorrow, it's the one huddled in Anjar," [...] in reference to the Syrian chief of intelligence based in that city. The New York Times credited Samir Kassir, a founder of the movement, with orchestrating the protests. On 14 March 2005, Atallah addressed the demonstrators, <b>articulating</b> <b>the</b> need for a free, sovereign, and united Lebanon. The DLM called on the protesters to press on to Baabda Palace, residence of the president, hoping to use the momentum to compel Emile Lahoud to resign. However, resistance by Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir prevented this, resulting in a temporary fallout between the DLM and opposition.|$|E
500|$|Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, {{noted that the}} lyrics of [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] are an hymn to the joys of {{unconsciousness}} and {{a rejection of the}} supposed constraints of reason and language, hence the line [...] "Words are useless, especially sentences, They don't stand for anything, How could they explain how I feel?" [...] Lyrically, despite being a song about a trip to the unconscious, scholars have noticed subtexts within the song's meaning. Vicente noted that postmodernism and new age themes are prevalent within the lyrics, especially with regards to their incapability of <b>articulating</b> <b>the</b> concept of the truth, as well as the song's theme of meditation and relax. Islamic mystic and sexual themes have also been noted within the song's lyrics. Vicente further found that the cliché references to [...] "honey", [...] "longing and yearning", and the sexual connotations of being [...] "wet on the inside" [...] does not relate to [...] "secular" [...] love, but to [...] "ecstatic" [...] Sufi poetry. The lyrics allude to concepts of movement which are [...] "central" [...] to Sufi philosophy: [...] "It indicates achieving fana through sema (getting 'lost' and 'leaving logic and reason to the arms of unconsciousness')".|$|E
