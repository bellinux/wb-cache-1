40|$|AIM: To {{research}} the correlation factor of the anterior segment values of eyes with different axial lengths. METHODS: In this study, 697 cases 697 eyes were included. According to axial length we divided {{all the cases}} into short axial length group, normal axial length group, mild long axial length group, moderate long axial length group and severe long axial length group. The relevant indicators of the anterior segment values of patients in the five groups was comparatively analyzed. RESULTS: In the short axial length group, the anterior chamber volume(ACV) showed a significantly negative correlation with age; anterior chamber depth(ACD) showed a significantly negative correlation with age. In the normal axial length group, the ACV showed a significantly negative correlation with age <b>and</b> a <b>significantly</b> positive correlation with axial length(AXL); the anterior chamber angle(ACA) showed a significantly negative correlation with age <b>and</b> a <b>significantly</b> positive correlation with AXL, <b>and</b> a <b>significantly</b> positive correlation with corneal curvature; the ACD showed a significantly negative correlation with age <b>and</b> a <b>significantly</b> positive correlation with AXL. In the mild long axial length group, the ACV showed a significantly negative correlation with age <b>and</b> a <b>significantly</b> positive correlation with AXL, <b>and</b> a <b>significantly</b> negative correlation with corneal curvature; the ACA showed a significantly negative correlation with age <b>and</b> a <b>significantly</b> positive correlation with AXL, <b>and</b> a <b>significantly</b> positive correlation with corneal curvature; the ACD showed a significantly negative correlation with age <b>and</b> a <b>significantly</b> positive correlation with AXL. In the moderate long axial length group, the ACV showed a significantly negative correlation with age; the ACA showed a significantly positive correlation with AXL; the ACD showed a significantly positive correlation with AXL.
