40|$|Abstract We {{present an}} {{approach}} for reasoning about actions and plans when domain knowledge {{is represented by}} <b>a</b> symbolic <b>causal</b> network, which is a principled, logical representation of a domain that explicates its perceived causal structure. The proposed approach shows that causal structures can {{play a key role}} in logical reasoning about actions given their effective role in dealing with some of the problems associated with such reasoning, including the frame, ramification, and concurrency problems. 1 Introduction <b>A</b> symbolic <b>causal</b> network is <b>a</b> principled representation of a logical database (a set of propositional clauses), which encodes one's perception of <b>causal</b> relationships in <b>a</b> given domain; see Figure 1. In the same way that <b>a</b> probabilistic <b>causal</b> network represents <b>a</b> probability distribution that is faithful to <b>a</b> given <b>causal</b> structure [14], <b>a</b> symbolic <b>causal</b> network represents <b>a</b> logical database that satisfies similar faithfulness conditions [5]...|$|R

5|$|A 2007–2008 {{survey of}} over 19% of all colonies {{revealed}} {{a total loss}} of 35.8%. Operations that pollinated almonds lost, on average, {{the same number of}} colonies as those that did not. The 37.9% of operations that reported having at least some of their colonies die with a complete lack of bees had a total loss of 40.8% of colonies compared to the 17.1% loss reported by beekeepers without this symptom. Large operations {{were more likely to have}} this symptom, suggesting a contagious condition may be <b>a</b> <b>causal</b> factor. About 60% of all colonies that were reported dead in this survey died without the presence of dead bees in the hive, thus possibly suffered from CCD.|$|E
5|$|After the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) began a {{criminal}} inquiry, further autopsies indicated that Tomlinson {{had died from}} internal bleeding caused by blunt force trauma to the abdomen, in association with cirrhosis of the liver. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to charge Harwood, because the disagreement {{between the first and}} later pathologists meant they could not show <b>a</b> <b>causal</b> link between the death and alleged assault. That position changed in 2011; after the verdict of unlawful killing, the CPS charged Harwood with manslaughter. He was acquitted in 2012 and dismissed from the service a few months later.|$|E
5|$|Between 2003 and 2004, the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines {{received}} several reports of increased INR {{and risk of}} haemorrhage in people taking warfarin and cranberry juice.

5|$|Nazi Germany had {{a strong}} anti-tobacco {{movement}} as pioneering research by Franz H. Müller in 1939 demonstrated <b>a</b> <b>causal</b> link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer. The Reich Health Office took measures to try to limit smoking, including producing lectures and pamphlets. Smoking was banned in many workplaces, on trains and among on-duty members of the military. Government agencies also worked to control other carcinogenic substances such as asbestos and pesticides. As {{part of a general}} public health campaign, water supplies were cleaned up, lead and mercury were removed from consumer products and women were urged to undergo regular screenings for breast cancer.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} refocusing {{and strong}} refocusing of light rays in a space-time. A strongly refocusing space-time is refocusing. The converse is unknown. We construct examples of space-times which are refocusing, but not strongly so, {{at a particular}} point. These space-times are strongly refocusing at other points. The geometrization conjecture proved by Perelman implies that a globally hyperbolic refocusing space-time of dimension ≤ 4 admits a strongly refocusing Lorentz metric. We show that the possibly empty set of points at which <b>a</b> strongly <b>causal</b> space-time is refocusing is closed. We prove that a Lorentz covering space of <b>a</b> strongly <b>causal</b> refocusing space-time is <b>a</b> strongly <b>causal</b> refocusing space-time.

5|$|Rachel Larris, who {{has also}} {{conducted}} an academic study of The Daily Show, disputes the findings of Baumgartner and Morris. Larris argues that the study measured cynicism in overly broad terms, {{and that it would}} be extremely hard to find <b>a</b> <b>causal</b> link between viewing The Daily Show and thinking or acting in a particular way. Bloggers such as Marty Kaplan of The Huffington Post argue that so long as Stewart's comedy is grounded in truth, responsibility for increased cynicism belongs to the political and media figures themselves, not the comedian who satirizes them.|$|E

5|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of prions and proteins with prion-like domains {{arises from}} their self-templating ability {{and the resulting}} exponential growth of amyloid fibrils. The presence of amyloid fibrils in patients with degenerative diseases has been well documented. These amyloid fibrils are seen {{as the result of}} pathogenic proteins that self-propagate and form highly stable, non-functional aggregates. While this does not necessarily imply <b>a</b> <b>causal</b> relationship between amyloid and degenerative diseases, the toxicity of certain amyloid forms and the overproduction of amyloid in familial cases of degenerative disorders supports the idea that amyloid formation is generally toxic.|$|E

5|$|Although Fodor {{originally}} {{rejected the}} idea that mental states must have <b>a</b> <b>causal,</b> externally determined aspect, he has in recent years devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposes reductive accounts of the mind. He argues that mental states are multiply realizable {{and that there is}} a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He has also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterizes as the ill-grounded Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theory of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|In 1816 in France, a physician, J. P. A. Pasquier, {{described}} {{an outbreak of}} typhoid linked to the consumption of raw oysters. The first report of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894. As sewage treatment programmes became more prevalent in the late 19th century, more outbreaks took place. This may have been because sewage was released through outlets into the sea providing more food for bivalves in estuaries and coastal habitats. <b>A</b> <b>causal</b> link between the bivalves and the illness {{was not easy to}} demonstrate because the illness might come on days or even weeks after the ingestion of the contaminated shellfish. One viral pathogen is the Norwalk virus. This is resistant to treatment with chlorine-containing chemicals and may be present in the marine environment even when coliform bacteria have been killed by the treatment of sewage.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Robert Koch (1843–1910) {{established}} that microorganisms can cause disease. He {{found that the}} blood of cattle which were infected with anthrax always had large numbers of Bacillus anthracis. Koch found that he could transmit anthrax from one animal to another by taking {{a small sample of}} blood from the infected animal and injecting it into a healthy one, and this caused the healthy animal to become sick. He also found that he could grow the bacteria in a nutrient broth, then inject it into a healthy animal, and cause illness. Based on these experiments, he devised criteria for establishing <b>a</b> <b>causal</b> link between a microorganism and a disease and these are now known as Koch's postulates. Although these postulates cannot be applied in all cases, they do retain historical importance to the development of scientific thought and are still being used today.|$|E

5|$|In a study {{published}} in 2007, the National Institutes of Health deemed hexavalent chromium VI (chromium-6) to be a likely carcinogen in lab animals when consumed in large quantities in drinking water. Prior to the NIH study, a World Health Organization study found that chromium-6 was a likely cause of lung cancer when inhaled by humans. In 2010, test results released from a California non-profit group known as the Environmental Working Group showed that Norman's tap water has a chromium-6 concentration level of 12.90 parts per billion (ppb), which was the highest level detected among 35 U.S. cities sampled in the study. The group is studying chromium-6 levels in water supplies in an attempt to prove <b>a</b> <b>causal</b> link between the element's ingestion and cancer in humans, and as a result improve the country's water standards.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{was passed}} in 1988 that removed the need for {{veterans}} to prove <b>a</b> <b>causal</b> link between certain forms of cancer and radiation exposure due to nuclear tests. Incidence of the main expected causes of this increased mortality, leukemia and other cancers, was not significantly higher than normal. Death by those diseases was tabulated {{on the assumption that}} if radiation exposure had a life-shortening effect it would likely show up there, but it did not. Not enough data were gathered on other causes of death to determine the reason for this increase in all-cause mortality, and it remains a mystery. The mortality increase was higher, 5.7%, for those who boarded target ships after the tests than for those who did not, whose mortality increase was only 4.3%.|$|E
5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific explanation is the deductive-nomological model. It {{says that a}} successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a scientific law.

It is especially challenging to characterize what is meant by an explanation when the thing to be explained cannot be deduced from any law because {{it is a matter of}} chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained.
