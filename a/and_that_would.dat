5|$|During 1999, {{domestic}} air {{ticket prices}} increased 9.2%, and another 17% the following year. By 2001, the domestic capacity was {{below the level}} before Gardermoen opened. Braathens and SAS started cooperating to set the full-price tickets on routes to eleven cities. This meant that the prices were identical on all the routes where both airlines flew, although they {{were not allowed to}} make such cooperation with discounted tickets. During the crisis, Braathens had sold several aircraft and started leasing them back to gain liquidity. The company announced in 2000 that they were considering purchasing a smaller type of aircraft, that would replace the 737s on some routes, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> allow Braathens to start operating the Norwegian Air Shuttle services themselves.|$|E

I guess they'd have to have upward-reaching branches, too, for the line about 'lifting leafy arms to pray.' Rule out weeping willows.|$|E

He relied on his {{knowledge}} of geography and history to expand the locations visited in the story. The book was released on 12 August 2011, and was published by Westland Press. Before its release, the author confessed that many revelations would be present in the book, including the true nature of many characters. Two theatrical trailers were created for showing in multiplex cinema halls, as Tripathi believed that the film-going audience also reads his books, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> create publicity.|$|E

Then the shelves and the window were filled with all sorts of boxes, and whips, and puzzles, and tea-sets, and dolls, dressed and not dressed. There were bows and arrows, and darts, and jumping ropes, and glass dogs, and little rocking-horses, and a thousand other things.|$|R

5|$|The {{options for}} the new stadium {{included}} adding a third tier to the existing National Stadium, or moving to a new site. This last option was discounted {{because it would have}} required a vast car parking facility, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have put severe short-term pressures on the local transport infrastructure, creating traffic jams and pollution. The committee eventually chose a new stadium on the same site but with considerable increase in its capacity. It would also involve moving the alignment of the stadium from west-east to north-south. This was the option supported by the Millennium Commission. It would become the fourth redevelopment of the Cardiff Arms Park site. It was also decided that the new stadium should have a sliding roof to accommodate a multi-use venue, with a grass pitch for rugby and football. The only other sliding roofs in Europe at the time were at two Dutch stadia – the Amsterdam Arena, completed in 1996 with a capacity of 50,000; and Gelredome in Arnhem, a 30,000-capacity ground built from 1996 to 1998.|$|E
25|$|The point {{really about}} all this from our {{perspective}} {{has been that the}} critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs. We could have stepped aside from that task and then shouted, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be the end of our contribution... They would shout back at us <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{be the end of the}} story.

25|$|The best-known {{period in}} the history of Yorghan Tepe is by far one of the city of Nuzi in the 15th-14th centuries BC.

25|$|In 1883, church {{president}} John Taylor localized the quorums of seventy. Each stake {{was given}} a quorum of seventy, and seventies in that stake would belong to that quorum.
