50|$|MS Polarlys is a Hurtigruten vessel {{built by}} Ulstein Verft in Ulstein, Norway in 1996. It {{is named after}} the <b>Aurora</b> <b>polaris</b> and is the third Hurtigruten vessel to bear the name after this phenomenon.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} one of his {{experiments}} is depicted on the left front of the Norwegian 200 kroner note; it shows a magnetized terrella, simulating the Earth, suspended in an evacuated chamber. Birkeland's face appears a second time in a watermark in the blank space above the drawing of the Terrella, and his rudimentary magnetosphere appears on the back, but is only visible under ultraviolet light. The ring encircling the magnetic pole depicted {{on the back of the}} bank note is similar to the patterns predicted by Birkeland and shown more recently by satellites. His drawing of what became known as Birkeland currents from his book, The Norwegian <b>Aurora</b> <b>Polaris</b> Expedition 1902-1903, is shown on the back of the banknote at the right.|$|E
50|$|Birkeland {{proposed}} in 1908 {{in his book}} The Norwegian <b>Aurora</b> <b>Polaris</b> Expedition 1902-1903 that polar electric currents, today referred to as auroral electrojets, were connected {{to a system of}} currents that flowed along geomagnetic field lines into and away from the polar region. Such field-aligned currents are known today as Birkeland currents in his honour. He provided a diagram of field-aligned currents in the book, and this diagram is reproduced {{on the back of the}} Norwegian 200 kroner banknote in the lower right corner, and his terrella experiment is shown on the front at the left with a portrait of Birkeland on the right. The book on the 1902-1903 expedition contains chapters on magnetic storms on the Earth and their relationship to the Sun, the origin of the Sun itself, Halley's comet, and the rings of Saturn.|$|E
5000|$|Following his {{election}} on 19 October 2015, Prime Minister-elect Justin Trudeau used a congratulatory {{phone call from}} the President of the United States Barack Obama to inform him that Canada would eliminate its air combat role in Iraq and Syria, while maintaining the presence of its ground forces. This was later amended with only the fighter element being withdrawn. The <b>Polaris,</b> <b>Auroras</b> and transport aircraft would remain in support of allies. This move was criticized by the new Conservative Official Opposition, with one of its members claiming it was a [...] "weak response" [...] to ISIL.|$|R
40|$|Aurora, {{also known}} as the Northern Lights, is a form of {{fascinating}} display of Mother Nature. This luminous atmospheric phenomenon occurs most frequently above 60 ° North or South latitude, but also in other parts of Earth. In this project, based on the analysis and the algorithms stated in the paper [1] “Simulating the Aurora Borealis ” by Baranoski et al, the purpose is to implement this rendering effect using OpenGL via simple sheet modeling technique that consists of sine wave coupled with Bezier curves for generating randomness. The result is in a simple and crude form of display of <b>aurora</b> <b>polaris...</b>|$|E

40|$|New notations for {{magnetic}} disturbance fields are proposed, based on [...] the theoretical {{consideration of the}} electric current systems by which [...] they are produced. [...] A typical magnetic storm begins suddenly when the onrush of the front [...] of the solar gas is halted by the earth's magnetic field. This effect [...] (DCF field) is most markedly observed as a sudden increase of the horizontal [...] component of the earth's field (the storm sudden commencement, [...] abbreviated to ssc) — like a step function. In many cases, however, the [...] change of the field during the ssc is more complicated, and different at [...] different places. Such a complexity superposed on the simple increase [...] (DCF) is ascribed to a complicated current system generated in the polar [...] ionosphere (DP current). It is found that the changes of electromagnetic [...] conditions in the polar regions are communicated, without delay, to lower [...] latitudes, even down to the equatorial regions. It is inferred that the [...] equatorial jet is affected by such a change and produces the abnormal [...] enhancement of ssc along the magnetic dip equator. [...] From the extensive analysis of several magnetic storms that occurred [...] during the IGY and IGC, {{it is suggested that}} the capture of the solar [...] particles in the outer geomagnetic field occurs when irregularities [...] (containing tangled magnetic fields and high energy protons) embedded in [...] the solar stream, impinge on the earth [...] Thus the development of a magnetic [...] storm depends on the distribution of such irregularities in the stream. [...] The motions and resulting currents and magnetic fields of such "trapped" [...] solar particles are studied in detail for a special model. It is inferred [...] that a large decrease (DR field) must follow the initial increase; it is [...] ascribed to the ring current produced by such motion of solar protons oi [...] energy of order 500 Kev. It is proposed that during the storm there [...] appears a transient 'storm-time 1 belt well outside the outer radiation [...] belt. [...] It is predicted that the earth's magnetic field is reversed in [...] limited regions when the ring current is appreciably enhanced. This [...] involves the formation of neutral lines there. These may be of two [...] kinds, called X lines or 0 lines according as they are crossed or encircled [...] by magnetic lines of force. These may be entirely separated or [...] may be joined to form a loop, called an OX loop. It is shown that one [...] of them, the X line, which is connected with the auroral ionosphere by [...] the lines of force, could be the proximate source of th<e particles that [...] produce the <b>aurora</b> <b>polaris.</b> By postulating the existence of such X-type [...] neutral lines at about 6 earth radii, an explanation is obtained of the [...] detailed morphology of the aurora. This includes the auroral zones and [...] their changes, the nighttime peak occurrence of auroras, their thin [...] ribbon-like structure and their multiplicity, their diffuse and active [...] forms and the transition between them (break-up) the required electron [...] and proton flux, and the ray and wavy structures. [...] Among the most important phenomena associated with the sudden change [...] of the aurora from the diffuse to the active form are the simultaneous [...] appearance of the auroral electrojet and the resulting polar magnetic [...] disturbances (DP sub-storms). Several typical DP sub-storms are studied [...] in detail. It is concluded that a westward auroral jet is produced by a [...] southward electric field. It is shown that an instability of the sheetbeam [...] issuing from along the X-type neutral line can produce a southward [...] electric field of the required intensity. The southward electric field [...] produces an eastward motion of the electrons in the ionosphere. This may [...] be identified with the eastward motion of an active aurora and with the [...] westward auroral electrojet. [...] Besides such large changes- of the field, there often appear various [...] quasi-sinusoidal changes of the field, much less intense. They are [...] supposed to be hydromagnetic waves, some of which are generated in the [...] outer atmosphere and propagated through the ionosphere, where a certain [...] amount of their energy is dissipated. It is concluded however that Such [...] a dissipation is not sufficient to produce any appreciable heating of the [...] ionosphere...|$|E
