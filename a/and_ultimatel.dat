40|$|Evidence implicating {{differential}} {{gene expression}} {{as a significant}} driver of evolutionary novelty continues to accumulate, but {{our understanding of the}} underlying sources of variation in expression, both environmental and genetic, is wanting. Heritability in particular may be underestimated when inferred from genetic mapping studies, the predominant “genetical genomics ” approach to the study of expression variation. Such uncertainty represents a fundamental limita-tion to testing for adaptive evolution at the transcriptomic level. By studying the inheritance of expression levels in 10, 495 genes (10, 527 splice variants) in a threespine stickleback pedigree consisting of 563 individuals, half of which were subjected to a thermal treatment, we show that 74 – 98 % of transcripts exhibit significant additive genetic variance. Dominance variance is also prevalent (41 – 99 % of transcripts), and genetic sources of variation seem to play a more significant role in expression variance in the liver than a key environmental variable, temperature. Among-population comparisons suggest that the majority of differential expression in the liver is likely due to neutral divergence; however, we also show that signatures of directional selection may be more prevalent than those of stabilizing selection. This predominantly aligns with the neutral model of evolution for gene expression but also suggests that natural selectionmay still act on transcriptional variation in the wild.

However knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of this target age group (8 - 10 years) in relation to schistosomiasis, soil transmitted helminthiasis (STHs) and malaria is not known {{at a time when}} integrated plasmodium - helminth control strategies are being advocated. This study sought to assess KAP of grade 3 children in relation to schistosomiasis, STHs and malaria in order to establish an effective school based health education for disease transmission control. Grade 3 children (n = 172) attending four randomly selected primary schools (one in rural and 3 in the commercial farming areas) in Zimbabwe were interviewed using a pre-tested interviewer administered questionnaire. The urine filtration technique was used to determine S. haematobium infection status. Infection with S. mansoni and STHs was determined using a combination of results from the Kato Katz and formol ether concentration techniques. P. falciparum was diagnosed by examination of Giemsa stained thick blood smears. It was observed that 32. 0 %, 19. 2 % and 4. 1 % of the respondents had correct knowledge about the causes of schistosomiasis, malaria and STHs, respectively, whilst 22. 1 %, 19. 2 % and 5. 8 % knew correct measures to control schistosomiasis, malaria and STHs. Sixty-two percent and 44. 8 % did not use soap to wash hands after toilet and before eating food respectively, whilst 33. 1 % never wore shoes. There were no functional water points and soap for hand washing after toilet at all schools. There was a high prevalence distribution of all parasites investigated in this study at Msapa primary school - S. haematobium (77. 8 %), S. mansoni (33. 3 %) hookworms (29. 6 %) and P. falciparum (48. 1 %).

Instead, policy makers need to return to an earlier emphasis on “conservation, ” with energy efficiency seen as a means rather than an end in itself. We briefly review the concept of “intensive ” vs “extensive ” variables (i. e., energy efficiency vs energy consumption), and why attention to both consumption and efficiency is essential for effective policy in a carbon- and oil-constrained world with increasingly brittle energy markets. To start, energy indicators and policy evaluation metrics need to reflect energy consumption as well as efficiency. We introduce the concept of “variable ” (consumption-sensitive) efficiency, 1 where the level of efficiency varies as a function of size (for a home), capacity (for an appliance), or scale of energy consumption. We propose introducing variable efficiency criteria first in consumer information programs (appliance test methods, categories for appliance labeling) and then in voluntary rating and recognition programs (LEED and ENERGY STAR for homes).

Here we report the phenotype of mice characterised by deletion of two key players in mTOR regulation, Pten and Lkb 1, {{in a range of}} tissues including the mouse urothelium. Despite widespread recombination within the range of epithelial tissues, the primary phenotype we observe is the rapid onset of bladder tumorigenesis, with median onset of approximately 100 days. Single deletion of either Pten or Lkb 1 had no effect on bladder cell proliferation or tumour formation. However, simultaneous deletion of Lkb 1 and Pten led to an upregulation of the mTOR pathway and the hypoxia marker GLUT 1, increased bladder epithelial cell proliferation and ultimately tumorigenesis. Bladder tissue also exhibited characteristic features of epithelialmesenchymal transition, with loss of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and the tight junction protein ZO- 1, and increases in the mesenchymal marker vimentin as well as nuclear localization of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulator Snail. We show that these effects were all dependent upon mTOR activity, as rapamycin treatment blocked both EMT and tumorigenesis. Our data therefore establish clear synergy between Lkb 1 and Pten in controlling the mTOR pathway within bladder epithelium, and show that loss of this control leads to the disturbance of epithelial structure, EMT <b>and</b> <b>ultimatel...</b>|$|E

Winter chill is essential for most of the plants that fall dormant in the winter in order to avoid frost damage and do not resume growth until a certain amount of winter chill has accumulated for fulfilling their chilling requirement. Climate change is likely to affect chilling requirement of temperate fruit crops significantly and therefore, the opportunity to meet this requirement will be reduced as the climate becomes warmer. Increase in average global temperature would move the existing plant species and varieties to new latitudinal belts with favourable climates. It is, therefore, possible that crops that are used to be productive in one area may no longer be so or the other way round. The resultant of these climate changes are clearly apparent in the shifting of apple cultivation from lower elevations to higher altitudes in India. Insufficient chilling greatly influences flower initiation and fruit colouration along with deterioration in fruit texture and taste. Further, the lack of proper chilling is also posing serious problems like scab disease, premature leaf fall and infestation of red spider mite in apple.

Two further studies were conducted in 2005 and 2006 of applying foliar boron up to three times, once with foliar nitrogen and a combination of foliar boron and nitrogen. These treatments were examined for their ability to enhance fruit set. Application of foliar boron and/or nitrogen to inflorescences when they started to expand did not enhance fruit set. No optimum boron level for fruit set was apparent in the flowers treated in 2005 and 2006. Multiple applications of foliar applied boron did not enhance fruit set or increase the boron content significantly beyond that of a single application of boron to flower buds when they first started to expand. Multiple applications of boron also did not enhance fruit set when an orchard was in an "off " year. Such results suggest that applying boron multiple times during flower development is not required for good fruit set nor can multiple applications overcome the effect of alternate bearing on fruit set. The lack of a consistent enhancement of fruit set through using foliar applications of boron over three years is an unnecessary orchard practice as long as a balanced fertilizer programme is used on the orchard.

For the past summer, I have been involved in researching the potential problems, investigating ways to remove the particles, and conducting experiments to validate the techniques. The current technique under investigation uses piezoelectric ceramics imbedded in the fabric that vibrate and shake the particles free. The particles will be left on the planet s surface or collected a vacuum to be disposed of later. The ceramics vibrate when connected to an AC voltage supply and create a small scale motion similar to what people use at the beach to shake sand off of a beach towel. Because the particles are so small, similar to volcanic ash, caution must be taken to make sure that this technique does not further inbed them in the fabric and make removal more difficult.
