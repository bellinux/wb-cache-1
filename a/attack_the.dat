5|$|According to Oan Ali Mohammed, {{suppression}} of the Arab sovereignty movement was the spark {{that led to his}} desire to <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> Iranian Embassy in London. The plan was inspired by the Iran hostage crisis in which supporters of the revolution held the staff of the American embassy in Tehran hostage.|$|E
5|$|According to U.S. authorities, {{a single}} soldier – Staff Sergeant Robert Bales – {{conducted}} the <b>attack.</b> <b>The</b> U.S. military showed Afghan authorities the footage from the surveillance video {{at the base}} as proof {{that there was only}} one perpetrator of the shootings.|$|E

He subsequently decided to <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> British forces before going into winter quarters. On December 29, he led his army back into Trenton. On the night of January 2, 1777, Washington repulsed a British attack at the Battle of the Assunpink Creek. That night, he evacuated his position, circled around General Lord Cornwallis' army, and went to <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> British garrison at Princeton.|$|E

5|$|After the battle, Persano was {{replaced}} by Admiral Giovanni Vacca; {{he was ordered to}} <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> main Austrian naval base at Pola, but the war ended before the operation could be carried out. After the end of the war, the government lost confidence in the fleet and drastically reduced the naval budget. The cuts were so severe that the fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> port of Civitavecchia in September 1870, as part of the wars of Italian unification. Instead, the ships were laid up and the sailors conscripted to man them were sent home. Terribile was rapidly surpassed, first by central battery and then turret ships, which made the first generation of ironclads like Terribile and her sister obsolete.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Vacca {{replaced}} Persano; he {{was ordered}} to <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> main Austrian naval base at Pola, but the war ended before the operation could be carried out.|$|E

50|$|The battle {{opened with}} the Japanese 5th Army <b>attacking</b> <b>the</b> left {{flank of the}} Russian forces on 20 February. On 27 February 1905 the Japanese 4th Army <b>attacked</b> <b>the</b> right flank, while other Japanese forces also <b>attacked</b> <b>the</b> Russian front lines. On the same day, the Japanese 3rd Army began its {{movement}} in a wide circle northwest of Mukden.|$|R
5|$|American counterattacks {{continued}} into the morning of August 7, but the gains were slow, hampered by the hot weather {{and a lack of}} food and water. The North Koreans were able to press forward and regain the Cloverleaf Hill and Oblong-ni Ridge, critical terrain astride the main road in the bulge area. By 16:00 that day, the 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd US Infantry Division, a unit newly arrived in Korea, was sent to the region. Church immediately ordered it to <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> North Korean salient at the bulge. 9th Infantry was fresh and well-equipped. They were also inexperienced, many of their number being reservists. Despite a tenacious <b>attack,</b> <b>the</b> 9th Infantry was only able to regain part of Cloverleaf Hill before intense fighting stalled its movement.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} mount {{between the}} military and the people of Wausau, a riot is started at a picket line. The revivers and the glowing men escape the dairy farm and begin to <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> military. The glowing men are able to possess bodies, prompting a shoot-on-sight response from panicked soldiers.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, the British press were jubilant; many {{newspapers}} {{sought to}} portray the battle as a victory for Britain over anarchy, and the success was used to <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> supposedly pro-republican Whig politicians Charles James Fox and Richard Brinsley Sheridan.|$|E
2500|$|As well as aiding {{in some of}} the operations, the Long Range Desert Group was {{to carry}} out <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> on <b>the</b> Italians at Barce, {{particularly}} the airfield there.

25|$|In 1614, {{subsequent}} {{to the death of}} Venkatapati and taking advantage of a predicament in naming his successor, <b>the</b> Portuguese <b>attacked</b> <b>the</b> Dutch at Pulicat. In 1623, <b>the</b> Portuguese <b>attacked</b> <b>the</b> harbor and burned two ships. In 1633, <b>the</b> Portuguese again <b>attacked</b> <b>the</b> Dutch at Pulicat with a promise of land support from the Vijayanagar ruler which never materialized. After the Portuguese had withdrawn their fleet, the Vijayanagara King (Sri Ranga) residing at Ratnagiri then <b>attacked</b> <b>the</b> Dutch at Pulicat but was paid a handsome tribute by the Dutch. Thereafter, the Dutch were not troubled.|$|R

5|$|Cimon {{then moved}} to pre-emptively <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> Persian forces near the Eurymedon. Sailing {{into the mouth of}} the river, Cimon quickly routed the Persian fleet {{gathered}} there. Most of the Persian fleet made land-fall, and the sailors fled to the shelter of the Persian army. Cimon then landed the Greek marines and proceeded to <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> Persian army, which was also routed. The Greeks captured the Persian camp, taking many prisoners, and were able to destroy 200 beached Persian triremes. This stunning double victory seems to have greatly demoralised the Persians, and prevented any further Persian campaigning in the Aegean until at least 451 BC. However, the Delian League do not appear to have pressed home their advantage, probably because of other events in the Greek world that required their attention.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Jaime Sabater, Sr. (1904–1955), a United States Naval Academy graduate, Class of 1927, {{commanded}} the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines, 3rd Marine Division during the Bougainville amphibious operations. On November 1, 1943. The Allies intended {{to establish a}} beachhead around Cape Torokina, within which an airfield would be built. Allied forces did not plan, at that time, to try to capture the entire island of Bougainville from Japanese forces. An attempt by the Japanese Navy to <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> U.S. landing forces was defeated in the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, between November 1 and November 2. A subsequent attempt by Japanese land forces to <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> Allied beachhead was defeated in the Battle of Koromokina Lagoon.|$|E

When one of the player's characters directly attacks an enemy with a weapon, they can repeatedly <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> enemy by pressing the button {{in time with the}} beat of the background music, with each enemy possessing a musical theme with different rhythms. Using this system, the player can <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> enemy up to sixteen times in a row. When the correct beat is not apparent, the player can put the enemy to sleep to isolate the beat from the music.|$|E

5|$|During the Battle of Vergas, Ibrahim {{decided to}} <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> Maniots from the rear. His {{plan was to}} send a small fleet with a few {{soldiers}} to land at the Bay of Diros, 2 kilometers south of Areopolis. The aim of this was to capture the unguarded Areopoli, which cut the communication lines of the defenders at Vergas and demoralize them as well. He would {{then be able to}} <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> Maniots from the rear and control the mountain passes to eastern Mani and Gytheio. Authors Peter Greenhalgh and Edward Eliopoulos describe this plan as excellent.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{fought in}} the Raid on St Malo in June 1758. The British landed near St Malo, at first {{planning}} to <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> town. However, they decided to destroy shipping first and <b>attack</b> <b>the</b> town later. Finding that to occupy the town would require a full siege, for which they had insufficient troops, they occupied St Servan, where they burned over one hundred vessels including thirty privateers. British ships retreated after seeing a large French force, but sailed around the coast {{for a few weeks}} seeking another place to attack. Even though the Raid on St Malo was small and little damage was done, it is considered a British victory.|$|E
