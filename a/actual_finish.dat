Wirdheim became the first Swede to win the championship in its 19-year history, breaking Justin Wilson's previous record of most points won in one season of the series. Wirdheim's season was marred by an embarrassing incident at Monaco when, driving to an easy win on the streets of Monte Carlo, Wirdheim slowed down to wave at his pit-crew believing he already had taken the checkered flag and thus gave away the win to Nicolas Kiesa, metres away from the <b>actual</b> <b>finish</b> line.|$|E
5000|$|Dastardly was aided in his schemes by his sidekick, a scruffy {{anthropomorphic}} dog named Muttley who had {{a distinctive}} wheezy laugh, heard most often when Dastardly's schemes failed. Despite Dastardly and Muttley's attempts, the [...] "double-dealing do-badders", as the opening narration of Wacky Races describes them, failed to win a single race. Dastardly's plans were always foiled either by his or Muttley's incompetence, the actions of another racer, or sheer bad luck, resulting in Dastardly crossing the finish line last, if at all. On some occasions Dastardly {{is very close to}} winning, but he will fail at the final hurdle. Once Dastardly had an opportunity to win legitimately, but he {{stopped in front of the}} finish line to pose for his picture as it was a photo finish. Another time, he came close to winning the race, but stopped to sign an autograph for Muttley, ending up in fourth place again. Another time Dastardly almost crossed the Finish Line first-until Muttley sabotaged his chances of winning! On one occasion, however, Dastardly did cross the finish line in first place, although the judges demanded to see a replay and it showed that Dastardly had extended the nose of his car at the last minute, and so Dastardly was denied the victory in favour of Penelope Pitstop (although in a later episode, another racer used a similar tactic from last place and was declared the winner, implying that the judges were biased against Dastardly; what's more, the <b>actual</b> <b>finish</b> of the race showed Dastardly crossing without extending his nose, suggesting that the judges may have doctored the footage, again out of bias). In one race Dastardly and Muttley did cross the Finish line first without cheating-but were disqualified because-due to a series of comic mishaps-they were in the wrong car.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: During {{closed-loop}} exercise, such as marathon running, {{the athlete}} adopts a pacing strategy to optimise performance. Exercise intensity (speed) is modulated {{in response to}} afferent signals from biological and psychological systems, which relay {{the responses of the}} exercise to the brain where efferent, homeostatic-orientated responses are issued. Thus a conscious perception of effort is continuously compared to a sub-conscious template which is derived from previous exposure to the sensations of pain and fatigue and expected exercise duration. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the association between pacing strategy/race outcome and biological age of the athlete. METHODS: Following local institutional ethical approval n = 777 runners who were competing in the 2015 London Marathon volunteered and agreed to participate. Age, gender and experience of the participants were ascertained using an online survey and opportunistic questionnaire surveying at the pre-marathon registration event. Age was stratified according to the following classifications: 18 - 39 yrs, 40 - 49 yrs, 50 - 59 yrs and > 60 yrs. Additionally, participants were asked to predict their marathon finish time (PT) serving as a proxy for end-point and compared to <b>actual</b> <b>finish</b> time (FT). All participating runners 5 km splits and FT were downloaded from the race website, converted to speed and then normalised (%) to the final split time/speed (m∙s- 1). RESULTS: Significant differences were observed for all age groups (p 60 yrs (p = 0. 153). Non-significant differences observed between age groups across all 5 km splits (p > 0. 05), but within group differences observed between 10 - 15 km for all age groups (p 60 yrs at 30 - 35 km (ES = 0. 53). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the biological age of the athlete is associated with the implementation of a successful pacing strategy and may be a function of the accrued training volume and/or emotional-event development. Athletes are encouraged to pace themselves with older (> 60 yrs) athletes with similar PT’...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{established}} that experts are particularly adept at recalling and/or recognizing the key features of domain-relevant patterns.

A novel method of analysis was used where {{the accuracy of the}} participants in recalling player positions was compared to actual player positions both at the final frame of pattern presentation and at 50 successive 40 ms increments thereafter. Experts encoded the locations of the players in both the static and moving patterns significantly further in advance of their <b>actual</b> <b>finishing</b> point than did nonexperts.

The {{small amount of}} nonzero C_i^out values for finishing farms and farrow-to-finishing farms, i.e. the farm types {{at the end of}} the pork supply chain, can be explained by the exclusion of the abattoirs from the network analysis. Thus, these two farm types had almost no outgoing edges. To be more precise, only three finishing farms at all had outgoing edges. But these three farms could be classified as pure rearing farms which receive weaned piglets from a farrowing farm and delivered the piglets with about 30  kg body weight to another finishing farm. Therefore, they build a bridge between farrowing farms and the <b>actual</b> <b>finishing</b> farms with relatively stable trade contacts. However, all other finishing farms had no outgoing edges due to the exclusion of the abattoir. For a node without outgoing edges C_i^out cannot be computed and is therefore set to zero.|$|R
50|$|An analogy can {{be drawn}} with {{choosing}} among contractors based on their initial (nonbinding) estimate {{of the cost of}} a job. The <b>actual</b> <b>finished</b> cost is very likely to be higher than the estimate. Despite this, choosing the contractor who furnished the lowest estimate should theoretically result in the lowest final project cost. This is because, in the absence of other data, we would assume that all of the relevant contractors have the same risk of cost overruns. In practice, of course, unscrupulous business practices may bias this result; in phylogenetics, too, some particular phylogenetic problems (for example, long branch attraction, described above) may potentially bias results. In both cases, however, {{there is no way to}} tell if the result is going to be biased, or the degree to which it will be biased, based on the estimate itself. With parsimony too, there is no way to tell that the data are positively misleading, without comparison to other evidence.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an improved}} approach for forecasting {{the outcome of}} horseraces. Building upon previous literature, a state-of-the-art modelling paradigm is developed which integrates least-square support vector regression and conditional logit procedures to predict horses' winning probabilities. In order to adapt the least-square support vector regression model to this task, some free parameters have to be determined within a model selection step. Traditionally, this is accomplished by assessing candidate settings in terms of mean-squared error between estimated and <b>actual</b> <b>finishing</b> positions. This paper proposes an augmented approach to organise model selection for horserace forecasting using the concept of ranking borrowed from internet search engine evaluation. In particular, it is shown that the performance of forecasting models can be improved significantly if parameter settings are chosen {{on the basis of}} their normalised discounted cumulative gain (i. e. their ability to accurately rank the first few finishers of a race), rather than according to general purpose performance indicators which weight the ability to predict the rank order finish position of all horses equally.

40|$|Mitigation and {{prevention}} of increased storm-generated flows and pollutants {{as a result of}} urbanisation {{is one of the most}} challenging areas in the environmental engineering field today. Integrated stormwater management involves the development and implementation of a range of low-impact designs (LID) and best management practices (BMPs) to improve the quality of urban stormwater runoff before its discharge into the receiving environment. LID comprises design and development practices that use natural systems to avoid, minimise, and mitigate environmental damage. North Shore City Council (NSCC) has catchment management plans that provide guidance on managing the effects of peak stormwater runoff in all its catchment areas. The District Plan requires on-site stormwater detention and quality measures for all medium and high-density housing developments. This paper presents a retrospective assessment from two developments on the North Shore to show how integrated stormwater management including key elements of LID has been used, with mixed results. These real-case examples compare the intended outcomes from the initial consent application with the <b>actual</b> <b>finished</b> development, and whether adverse effects were managed during construction (short-term but significant effects).
