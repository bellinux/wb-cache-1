40|$|Mutual funds {{considered}} {{as an investment}} alternative for investors. One type of mutual fund that attracts many investors was the equity mutual funds. Equity mutual fund a type of mutual funds that most part of the investment consists of stocks in the capital market so the risk rate was higher than the other types of mutual funds. For its different characteristic, the measurement for equity funds performance did not be same {{with other types of}} mutual funds. As a stock portfolio, equity mutual funds can measure with portfolio measurement methods such as Sharpe Index, Treynor Ratio, Jensen <b>Index,</b> <b>Adjusted</b> Sharpe <b>Index,</b> <b>Adjusted</b> Jensen <b>Index,</b> and Sortino Ratio. This study was conducted by using all of those performance measurements as most research in Indonesia was conducted by using limited performance measurements (focusing on Sharpe Index, Treynor Ratio, and Jensen Index). This study aims to evaluated the performance of 42 equity mutual funds available in Indonesia by employing Sharpe Index, Treynor Ratio, Jensen <b>Index,</b> <b>Adjusted</b> Sharpe <b>Index</b> (ASI), <b>Adjusted</b> Jensen <b>Index</b> (AJI), and Sortino Ratio because most previous researches in Indonesian setting disregards ASI and AJI. In general, it was concluded that the SAM Indonesian Equity was the best performing equity fund during the study period.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} {{the construction and}} computation of a quality <b>adjusted</b> price <b>index</b> when the commodities are differentiated products, such as different brands of automobiles and refrigerators. The method we focus on {{is an extension of}} Trajtenberg’s approach. A key result obtained in the paper is that the evolution of the quality <b>adjusted</b> price <b>index</b> depends crucially on the fraction of consumers that do not purchase a variant of the product. The method is applied to data on automobile demand in Norway from 1994 to 2002. Both the Laspeyres index and the index based on hedonic regression yield lower estimates of the pricees from 1999 to 2002 than does the quality <b>adjusted</b> price <b>index.</b> This is mainly due to variations in the fraction of persons who purchase new automobiles.

The effectiveness of albumin <b>adjusted</b> IMA <b>index</b> in the diagnosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) was also studied. Material and methods: We analyzed serum levels of IMA and albumin <b>adjusted</b> IMA <b>index</b> in 120 patients each with AMI and apparently healthy subjects belonging to the control group. Further, both control and AMI groups were separately divided based on serum albumin concentration in to four groups of 4. 51 g/dl (n = 30 each).

Serum levels of IMA were significantly higher in AMI patients than in healthy controls (p value = < 0. 001), where as albumin <b>adjusted</b> IMA <b>index</b> values did not show any significant difference between the groups.

30|$|In {{order to}} compute the {{similarity}} between the obtained partitioning and true class labels of the 10 % data points for which original class label information are known, we have used an external cluster validity index as the third objective function. The use of this index provides a way of incorporating the labeled information in the unsupervised clustering. As the external cluster validity index, we have used <b>Adjusted</b> rand <b>index</b> (ARI) (Yeung and Ruzzo 2001). This is the third objective function which captures the matching between observed solution and prior knowledge based true solution for the 10 % data points. ARI is computed over only these 10 % data points for which class information are known. When two partitions agree completely then <b>adjusted</b> rand <b>index</b> value is 1. Thus higher values of <b>adjusted</b> rand <b>index</b> are better.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems in cluster analysis is the selection of variables that truly define cluster structure, while eliminating noisy variables that mask such structure.

40|$|Seasonally <b>adjusted</b> {{inflation}} <b>indexes</b> {{are available}} in official statistics and commonly used for analyzing demand pressure in many developed countries.

The paper offers tentative calculations of the magnitude of monthly consumer price index variations corresponding with seasonal frequencies. Furthermore, we present the seasonal adjustment procedures applied worldwide and estimate monthly inflation indexes refined from seasonality for Poland. The main conclusion of this paper is that seasonal factors account for about 40 % of monthly inflation volatility, which is, first and foremost, a consequence of specific food price changes over a year. Unprocessed food price dynamics variation is generated in 80 % by seasonality and is ten times higher than CPI variation. Therefore, seasonally <b>adjusted</b> monthly inflation <b>indexes</b> in January, March, April, September and October are lower than not corrected series. Moreover, the greatest impact of seasonal factors is observed in June, July and August, when reductions in food prices are heightened by clothing sales, and seasonally <b>adjusted</b> <b>indexes</b> are significantly higher than raw indexes.
