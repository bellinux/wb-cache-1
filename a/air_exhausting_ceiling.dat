50|$|Emissions from {{fossil fuel}} fired water heaters are {{expelled}} {{using a variety}} of venting technologies. Atmospheric vented systems use room air as combustion <b>air</b> and <b>exhaust</b> <b>air.</b> The <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> is expelled through the exhaust flue by buoyancy forces resulting from the combustion. Power vent models operate similarly to atmospheric vent systems, but an exhaust fan is added to aid in the expulsion of combustion gases. Direct vent systems do not use room air for combustion; instead, buoyancy forces air from the outside through the water heater combustion system and finally exhausts the combustion gases to the outside. Powered direct-vent systems include an exhaust fan to aid in the expulsion of combustion gasses.|$|R

40|$|Recovery {{energy of}} the <b>exhaust</b> in <b>air</b> {{conditioning}} {{is very important to}} clean operating rooms. In disinfected operating rooms, we often use completely fresh air conditioning system in order to maintain cleanliness. All the return air of the air conditioning must be discharged. For recovering the exhaust energy, whole heat exchangers are used, and they may bring cross-infection in clean operating rooms. Cross-infection would negatively affect cleanness. This paper puts forward an air layer inside of a building's external wall that acts as a passageway for <b>air</b> conditioning <b>exhaust,</b> and also providing a place for the thermal exchange of the <b>air</b> conditioning <b>exhaust.</b> This kind of envelope is named an interlayer ventilation wall. There are two advantages. First, it will recover and reutilize the energy that the <b>air</b> conditioning <b>exhaust</b> takes, avoid cross-infection between the fresh <b>air</b> and the <b>exhaust.</b> Second, it will lower the energy loss of the heat exchange through the envelope. The energy saving effect will be very significant in clean operating rooms...|$|R
