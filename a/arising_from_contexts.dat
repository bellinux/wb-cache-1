40|$|The β-model {{of random}} graphs is an {{exponential}} family model with the degree sequence as a sufficient statistic. In this paper, we contribute three key results. First, we characterize conditions {{that lead to}} a quadratic time algorithm to check {{for the existence of}} MLE of the β-model, and show that the MLE never exists for the degree partition β-model. Second, motivated by privacy problems with network data, we derive a differentially private estimator of the parameters of β-model, and show it is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed - it achieves the same rate of convergence as the nonprivate estimator. We present an efficient algorithm for the private estimator {{that can be used to}} release synthetic graphs. Our techniques can also be used to release degree distributions and degree partitions accurately and privately, and to perform inference from noisy degrees <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>contexts</b> other than privacy. We evaluate the proposed estimator on real graphs and compare it with a current algorithm for releasing degree distributions and find that it does significantly better. Finally, our paper addresses shortcomings of current approaches to a fundamental problem of how to perform valid statistical inference from data released by privacy mechanisms, and lays a foundational groundwork on how to achieve optimal and private statistical inference in a principled manner by modeling the privacy mechanism; these principles should be applicable to a class of models beyond the β-model.

40|$|A produÃÃo brasileira na {{literatura}} de temÃtica homoafetiva passou ao longo do sÃculo XX por uma significativa evoluÃÃo quantitativa e mesmo qualitativa. Ainda assim, a abordagem do tema envolvendo personagens na infÃncia e/ou prÃ-adolescÃncia continua bastante rarefeita na criaÃÃo literÃria brasileira. ApÃs um levantamento do que jÃ se produziu em nossa literatura com a homoafetividade na infÃncia sendo diretamente ou mesmo sutilmente abordada nos textos, a partir da publicaÃÃo de O Ateneu, de Raul PompÃia, em 1888, selecionamos quatro narrativas por meio das quais analisamos como as personagens literÃrias em idade infantil vivem situaÃÃes de desejo homoafetivo: o prÃprio O Ateneu; CapitÃes da areia (1937), de Jorge Amado; Dona SinhÃ e o filho padre (1964), de Gilberto Freyre; e Limite branco (1970), de Caio Fernando Abreu. Verificamos as representaÃÃes de poder surgidas a partir de contextos em que a crianÃa se apresenta envolvida nesse tipo de relaÃÃo, seja nas interaÃÃes entre as personagens, adultos e crianÃas, ou de acordo com o contexto apresentado (famÃlia, escola, igreja, rua) e ainda no que toca Ã prÃpria linguagem literÃria utilizada pelos ficcionistas. Para subsidiar a anÃlise, trabalhamos os conceitos de infÃncia, sexualidade, homoafetividade, poder (segundo Michel Foucault), com base no aparato teÃrico a respeito das personagens literÃrias. The Brazilian {{production of}} homoaffective themes/issues in literature evolved significantly both in {{quantitative and qualitative}} terms throughout the twentieth century. Still, the approach to the subject involving characters in childhood and / or pre â adolescence is quite scarce in Brazilian literary creation. Based on a survey {{of what has been}} written in Brazilian literature regarding homoaffective relations in childhood addressed in the texts directly or in a subtle way, from the publication of O Ateneu (The Athenaeum), by Raul Pompeia, in 1888, four narratives were selected, through which we analyze how literary child characters face homoaffective desire: O Ateneu; CapitÃes da areia (Captains of the sands) (1937) by Jorge Amado, Dona SinhÃ e o filho padre (Mother and son) (1964), by Gilberto Freyre, and Limite branco (White boundary) (1970), by Caio Fernando Abreu. We analyzed the representations of power <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>contexts</b> in which the child has engaged in this kind of relationship, the interactions between the characters, adults and children, in relation to the given context (family, school, church, street) and the literary language used by the authors.

With this purpose in mind, the article engages especially the later work of the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur.

In light of this affirmation of the dialectical relationship between memory and history, the article further emphasises some aspects that are important to consider in the search for a responsible historical hermeneutic.

40|$|A {{notion of}} truth as {{applicable}} to events of fact-stating use (utterances) {{of a sentence}} type is arguably presupposed and required by our evaluative practices {{of the use of}} language. The truth of an utterance clearly depends on what the utterance says. This fundamental dependence seems to be captured by the schema that if an utterance u says that P, then u is true iff P. Such a schema may thus be thought to constitute a suitable basis for an adequate theory of utterance truth, so much so that it seems straightforwardly to avoid the problems <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>context</b> dependence and the semantic paradoxes which notoriously beset theories of utterance truth based on a simple disquotational schema. The paper argues that appearances are deceptive in both cases. On the one hand, the schema cannot allow for non-indexical forms of context-dependence, <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> the fact that what an utterance says can be the case or not as evaluated with respect to different situations and that the truth of an utterance u of a sentence ϕ arguably depends on the truth of ϕ at the situation “associated” with u’s context of utterance. On the other hand, a quantified utterance-truth variation on the liar paradox shows that the schema entails some consequence ϕ {{and at the same time}} the untruth of any utterance of ϕ; moreover, a resilient quantified propositional variation on the contingent liar paradox is offered, which only relies on resources usually employed by theories of utterance truth based on the schema. 1...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores how a {{disadvantaged}} context {{impacts on}} secondary school organisation and processes, {{and how this}} affects quality, as measured by OFSTED inspection. OFSTED data indicates a school quality problem in disadvantaged areas. This is often interpreted as <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> factors internal to the school. Policy interventions have concentrated on generic school improvement measures. However, it may be argued that if poor quality <b>arises</b> <b>from</b> <b>context</b> {{as well as from}} internal factors, policy responses should also be contextualised. Earlier work (Gewirtz 1998; Thrupp 1999) has begun to reveal process effects of disadvantaged contexts. This thesis builds on that work by exploring differences between disadvantaged areas, making an explicit link to quality measures, and using wider literatures from the fields of neighbourhood studies and organisation theory to develop an understanding of schools as contextualised organisations. The thesis begins with a quantitative analysis of context/quality relationships, but is principally based on four qualitative case studies. These consider context objectively, analysing socio-economic, market and institutional factors, and also explore staff’s subjective interpretations. Process implications for schools are examined, as are the schools’ responses, in terms of the design and delivery of schooling. These findings are discussed in relation to OFSTED quality measures. The research reveals that the quality problem in poor areas is partly an artefact of the inspection system but also reflects contextual effects. It also finds that there are significant differences between the contexts of schools in disadvantaged areas, and that these are not captured by typical context measures. The study concludes that changes are needed in school funding and inspection to recognise contextual effects, and that specific practices need to be developed to enable school improvement in poor areas. Relying on schools to apply generic ‘good practice’ within existing constraints will not be sufficient to eliminate the quality problem. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Theoretically, it provides a conceptual framework, which enables analysis to systematically differentiate between distinct forms of pattern bargaining in terms of scope, agency, development and function, which <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> differing <b>contexts</b> in terms of interest configuration, power relations and economic conditions. This framework is used to develop testable hypotheses on pattern bargaining as a mechanism of inter-industry bargaining co-ordination. The empirical part of the article examines these hypotheses for collective bargaining from 1969 to 2004 in Austria, which is commonly seen as a paradigm case of pattern bargaining.
