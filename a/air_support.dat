40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the drift {{precision}} of <b>air</b> <b>supported</b> gyroscope, effects of surface roughness magnitude and direction on vortex torque of <b>air</b> <b>supported</b> gyroscope are studied. Based on Christensen's rough surface stochastic model and consistency transformation method, Reynolds equation of <b>air</b> <b>supported</b> gyroscope containing surface roughness information is established. Also effects of mathematical models of main machining errors on vortex torque are established. By using finite element method, the Reynolds equation is solved numerically and the vortex torque {{in the presence of}} machining errors and surface roughness is calculated. The results show that surface roughness of slit has a significant effect on vortex torque. Transverse surface roughness makes vortex torque greater, while longitudinal surface roughness makes vortex torque smaller. The maximal difference approaches 11. 4 % during the range analyzed in this article. However surface roughness of journal influences vortex torque insignificantly. The research is of great significance for designing and manufacturing <b>air</b> <b>supported</b> gyroscope and predicting its performance...|$|R
5|$|In 2003 {{and into}} 2004, the brigade {{deployed}} {{for the first}} time to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. As the only aviation brigade in the theater, the brigade provided <b>air</b> <b>support</b> for all U.S. Army units operating in the country. The brigade's mission at that time focused on close <b>air</b> <b>support,</b> medevac missions, and other duties involving combat with Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces in the country. The brigade returned to Fort Drum in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Soviet <b>air</b> <b>support</b> in the {{southern}} part of the salient was provided by the 2nd Air Army and the 17th Air Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Stepan Krasovsky and Lieutenant General Vladimir Sudets, respectively. However, the bulk of the <b>air</b> <b>support</b> was committed in support of Soviet units attacking XLVIII Panzer Corps to the west of Prokhorovka and the III Panzer Corps to the southeast, and only limited numbers of aircraft were available to support 5th Guards Tank Army's attack.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{existing}} {{command and control}} arrangement between the CIA, the AIRA, and the Seventh Air Force, the Air Force wielded little actual control over <b>air</b> <b>support.</b> In order to increase its dominance, {{a reduction in the}} role of the Raven FACS was called for. Instead, greater use was to be made of Nail FACs from Nakhon Phanom's 23rd Tactical <b>Air</b> <b>Support</b> Squadron which had recently begun transitioning to OV-10 Bronco aircraft. In the end, the Nails made increasing appearances over Military Region 2, but they never seriously encroached on the role of the Ravens.|$|E

5|$|With air {{supremacy}} attained, Luftflotte 2 turned to support of ground operations, particularly guarding the flanks of the armoured spearheads, without which the rapid advance was not possible. When enemy counterattacks threatened, Kesselring threw {{the full weight}} of his force against them. Now that the Army was convinced of the value of <b>air</b> <b>support,</b> units were all too inclined to call for it. Kesselring now had to convince the Army that <b>air</b> <b>support</b> should be concentrated at critical points. He strove to improve army–air cooperation with new tactics and the appointment of Colonel Martin Fiebig as a special close <b>air</b> <b>support</b> commander. By 26 July, Kesselring reported the destruction of 165 tanks, 2,136 vehicles and 194 artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|A flying ace, Geißhardt was {{credited}} with 102 victories in 642 combat missions, including 37 close <b>air</b> <b>support</b> missions. He achieved 63 of his victories over the Eastern Front.

5|$|Australia {{played a}} small {{role in the}} Italian Campaign. The RAN {{returned}} to the Mediterranean between May and November 1943 when eightBathurst class corvettes were transferred from the British Eastern Fleet to the Mediterranean Fleet to protect the invasion force during the Allied invasion of Sicily. The corvettes also escorted convoys in the western Mediterranean {{before returning to the}} Eastern Fleet. No.239Wing and four Australian ArticleXVsquadrons also took part in the Sicilian Campaign, flying from bases in Tunisia, Malta, North Africa and Sicily. No.239Wing subsequently provided <b>air</b> <b>support</b> for the Allied invasion of Italy in September 1943 and moved to the mainland {{in the middle of that}} month. The two Australian fighter bomber squadrons provided close <b>air</b> <b>support</b> to the Allied armies and attacked German supply lines until the end of the war. No.454Squadron was also deployed to Italy from August 1944 and hundreds of Australians served in RAF units during the campaign.|$|E

5|$|Evacuation plans already existed as a {{standard}} procedure for American embassies. At the beginning of March, fixed-wing aircraft began evacuating civilians from Tan Son Nhat Airport through neighboring countries. By mid-April, contingency plans were in place and preparations were underway for a possible helicopter evacuation. As the imminent collapse of Saigon became evident, Task Force 76 (TF76) was assembled off the coast near Vung Tau to support a helicopter evacuation and provide <b>air</b> <b>support</b> if required. In the event, <b>air</b> <b>support</b> was not needed as the North Vietnamese paused for {{a week at the}} outskirts of Saigon, possibly waiting for the South Vietnamese government to collapse and avoiding a possible confrontation with the U.S. by allowing the mostly-unopposed evacuation of Americans from Saigon.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of both the TSR-2 and P.1154 programmes, the RAF were still left with a requirement to replace both the Canberra and Hunter in the long-range strike, close <b>air</b> <b>support</b> and reconnaissance roles. This resulted in the procurement of two aircraft, the General Dynamics F-111K, intended for the long-range interdiction roles {{carried out by the}} Canberra, and the F-4M Phantom, which would be used in the close <b>air</b> <b>support</b> role undertaken by the Hunter. The F-111K was cancelled within a year of being ordered, but the order for 150 Phantoms went ahead alongside the Phantom order for the Royal Navy; the final 32 units of the RAF order were eventually cancelled. The RAF Phantom, given the designation FGR.2, was broadly similar to the naval version, with some minor variations in terms of engines, avionics and structure, which related to its use as a land-based, rather than carrier-based aircraft.|$|E
