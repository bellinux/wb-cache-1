5|$|Although {{it appears}} to be a single star to the naked eye, Capella is {{actually}} a system of four stars in two binary pairs. The first pair consists of two bright yellow giant stars, both of which are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun. They have exhausted their core hydrogen, and cooled and swollen, moving off the main sequence. Designated Capella Aa and Capella Ab, they <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> tight circular orbit some 0.76 astronomical units (au) apart, and orbit each other every 104 days. Capella Aa is the cooler and more luminous of the two with spectral class K0III; it is 78.7 ± 4.2 times the Sun's luminosity and 11.98 ± 0.57 times its radius.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that gender differences in attachment patterns of adaptive significance begin to emerge in middle childhood. Insecure attachment and early psychosocial stress indicate the presence of environmental risk (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). Environmental risk can cause insecure attachment, while also favouring the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive strategies have different adaptive values for males and females: Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless they <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high risk environment. Adrenarche is proposed as the endocrine mechanism underlying the reorganization of insecure attachment in middle childhood.|$|E

25|$|Paestum {{was a major}} ancient Greek city on {{the coast}} of the Tyrrhenian Sea in Magna Graecia (southern Italy). The ruins of Paestum are famous for their three ancient Greek temples in the Doric order, dating from about 600 to 450 BC, which <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good state of preservation. The city walls and amphitheatre are largely intact, and the bottom of the walls of many other {{structures}} remain, as well as paved roads.

500|$|The most {{substantial}} {{development of}} Gibraltar's fortifications {{took place during}} the British occupation of the territory from 1704 to the present day. Little was done initially to improve the fortifications, beyond making modest upgrades and repairing the damage caused by the 1704 siege. In 1709, General James Stanhope complained to the Earl of Galway that [...] "the [...] works in general <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> bad condition, and the money they have cost I am afraid has been ill laid out", by which he meant that it had been misappropriated. Rather than being spent on the fortifications, the funds had been diverted by corrupt officers to repair their own houses in the town. Other officers were accused of stealing cannons and selling them for profit in Lisbon. Stanhope expressed concern that the prospect of losing Gibraltar was [...] "very practicable" [...] given the poor condition of the defences.|$|E

500|$|These {{gardens are}} {{probably}} {{references to the}} Garden of Eden, {{but it has also}} been proposed, by Bottiglia, for example, that the gardens refer also to the Encyclopédie, and that Candide's conclusion to cultivate [...] "his garden" [...] symbolises Voltaire's great support for this endeavour. Candide and his companions, as they find themselves {{at the end of the}} novella, <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> similar position to Voltaire's tightly knit philosophical circle which supported the Encyclopédie: the main characters of Candide live in seclusion to [...] "cultivate [...] garden", just as Voltaire suggested his colleagues leave society to write. In addition, there is evidence in the epistolary correspondence of Voltaire that he had elsewhere used the metaphor of gardening to describe writing the Encyclopédie. Another interpretative possibility is that Candide cultivating [...] "his garden" [...] suggests his engaging in only necessary occupations, such as feeding oneself and fighting boredom. This is analogous to Voltaire's own view on gardening: he was himself a gardener at his estates in Les Délices and Ferney, and he often wrote in his correspondence that gardening was an important pastime of his own, it being an extraordinarily effective way to keep busy.|$|E
2500|$|Condition of {{the surface}} layer: PC reports that the un-retouched {{portions}} of the image, particularly the blue mantle and the face, <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good state of preservation, with no flaking or peeling. The three most recent inspections (G, PC and R) agree (i) that additions {{have been made to}} the image (gold leaf added to the sun's rays—which has flaked off; silver paint or other material to depict the moon—which has discolored; and the re-construction or addition of the angel supporting the Marian image), [...] and (ii) that portions of the original image have been abraded and re-touched in places. [...] Some flaking is visible, though only in retouched areas (mostly along the line of the vertical seam, or at passages considered to be later additions).|$|E
2500|$|The IDH1 gene encodes for {{the enzyme}} isocitrate {{dehydrogenase}} 1 and is frequently mutated in glioblastoma (primary GBM: 5%, secondary GBM >80%). By producing very {{high concentrations of}} the [...] "oncometabolite" [...] D-2-hydroxyglutarate and dysregulating {{the function of the}} wild-type IDH1-enzyme it induces profound changes to the metabolism of IDH1-mutated glioblastoma, compared with IDH1 wild-type glioblastoma or healthy astrocytes. Among others, it increases the glioblastoma cells' dependence on glutamine or glutamate as an energy source. It has been hypothesized that IDH1-mutated glioblastoma <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high demand for glutamate and use this amino acid and neurotransmitter as a chemotactic signal. Since healthy astrocytes excrete glutamate, IDH1-mutated glioblastoma cells do not favor dense tumor structures but instead migrate, invade and disperse into healthy parts of the brain where glutamate concentrations are higher. This may explain the invasive behaviour of these IDH1-mutated glioblastoma.|$|E

2500|$|The quoit brooch {{is a type}} of brooch found {{from the}} 5th century and later during the Anglo-Saxon {{settlement}} of Britain that has given its name to the Quoit Brooch Style to embrace all types of Anglo-Saxon metalwork in the decorative style typical of the finest brooches. [...] The brooches take their modern name from the rings thrown in the game of quoits, and have the form of a broad ring, or circle with an empty centre, usually in bronze or silver (sometimes inlaid with silver or gold respectively), and often highly decorated. The forms <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> low relief, so contrasting with other early Anglo-Saxon styles, with detail added by shallow engraving or punching within the main shapes. Dots or dashes are often used to represent fur on the animal forms, as well as lines emphasizing parts of the body. [...] They are fixed with a single, straight hinged pin like those of other Anglo-Saxon ring or Celtic brooches and are further defined by the presence of a slot and pin-stops on the ring.|$|E

[...] Rhyner simply replied with [...] "Any other combat controller put in the same situation would have performed in the same, exact way ... Credit that to the training we receive and the process that we go through to become a combat controller." [...] Future Air Force Cross recipient, and fellow Combat Controller, Robert Gutierrez was also present at the Battle of Shok Valley with Rhyner, albeit with a different Special Forces team, and regarding Rhyner's actions he said reportedly, [...] "If it wasn't for Zach, I wouldn't be here." ...|$|E

He asked Kong Rong to let him lead soldiers to fight their way out, but Kong refused and insisted on waiting for reinforcements. The rebels came closer day by day. Kong Rong wanted to seek help from Liu Bei, the Chancellor of Pingyuan State (平原國; around present-day Pingyuan, Shandong), {{but no one had}} any idea on how {{to break out of the}} siege. Taishi Ci volunteered to fight his way out and seek reinforcements from Liu Bei, but Kong Rong said, [...] "The rebels have completely surrounded the fortress. Everyone thinks it is impossible to break out. It will be very difficult for you to break out no matter how courageous you are." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "When I was away, you treated my mother very generously. She feels grateful, hence she told me to help you. She knew that I know what I am doing, and that I can help you. Now, everyone says it is impossible to break out. If I were to agree with them, I will not be able to repay your kindness. Why, then, did my mother send me here for? We <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> desperate situation. I hope you won't hesitate any longer."
