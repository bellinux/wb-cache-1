5|$|A {{laboratory}} diagnosis is usually made based on recovery of poliovirus from <b>a</b> <b>stool</b> sample or a swab of the pharynx. Antibodies to poliovirus can be diagnostic, and are generally {{detected in the}} blood of infected patients early in the course of infection. Analysis of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is collected by a lumbar puncture ("spinal tap"), reveals an increased number of white blood cells (primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein level. Detection of virus in the CSF is diagnostic of paralytic polio, but rarely occurs.|$|E
5|$|Burial 10 is {{the tomb}} of Yax Nuun Ayiin. It is located beneath Structure 34 in the North Acropolis. The tomb {{contained}} a rich array of offerings, including ceramic vessels and food, and nine youths were sacrificed to accompany the dead king. A dog was also entombed with the deceased king. Pots in the tomb were stuccoed and painted and many demonstrated a blend of Maya and Teotihuacan styles. Among the offerings was an incense-burner {{in the shape of}} an elderly underworld god, sitting on <b>a</b> <b>stool</b> made of human bones and holding a severed head in his hands. The tomb was sealed with a corbel vault, then the pyramid was built on top.|$|E

50|$|The role of {{the midwife}} was very {{important}} {{during the process of}} childbirth and Soranus described her role in great detail. For example, the midwife was to have certain tools to ensure a safe delivery, including: clean olive oil, sea sponges, pieces of wool bandages to cradle the infant, a pillow, strong smelling herbs in case of fainting, and <b>a</b> birthing <b>stool.</b> <b>A</b> birthing <b>stool</b> is <b>a</b> chair from which the seat has been removed.|$|R
5|$|In 1746 Franklin {{began working}} on {{electrical}} experiments with Ebenezer Kinnersley after he bought all of Archibald Spencer's electrical equipment that he used in his lectures. Later he was also associated with Thomas Hopkinson and Philip Syng in experimentation with electricity. In the summer of 1747 they had received an electrical system from Thomas Penn. While no records exists to tell us exactly what parts {{were included in the}} system, historian J. A. Leo LeMay believes {{it was a combination of}} an electricity generating machine, a Leyden jar, a glass tube, and <b>a</b> <b>stool</b> that was electrically insulated from the ground. This gave Franklin a complete system to experiment with generating and storing electricity.|$|E
5|$|Lactulose and {{lactitol}} are disaccharides {{that are}} not absorbed from the digestive tract. They are thought to decrease the generation of ammonia by bacteria, render the ammonia inabsorbable by converting it to ammonium (NH4+) ions, and increase transit of bowel content through the gut. Doses of 15-30ml are administered three times a day; the result is aimed to be 3–5 soft stools a day, or (in some settings) <b>a</b> <b>stool</b> pH of <6.0. Lactulose may also be given by enema, especially if encephalopathy is severe. More commonly, phosphate enemas are used. This may relieve constipation, one {{of the causes of}} encephalopathy, and increase bowel transit.|$|E

5|$|The {{cinematography}} by William Lubtchansky furthers Rivette's {{interest in}} visual textures. The film's colour palette is largely natural, except for certain scenes—like the initial dream sequence—that are filmed in vivid colours. In {{the scene where}} Marie is arranging the attic room, the light changes—from shadow to warm light—just as she places an oil lamp on <b>a</b> <b>stool</b> to indicate that she has placed it correctly; this introduces a supernatural element that contrasts with the realism {{of the rest of}} the film.|$|E
5|$|Cricket was {{probably}} devised by children and survived for many generations as essentially a children's game. Possibly it {{was derived from}} bowls, assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman {{trying to stop the}} ball reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep's wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a gate (e.g., a wicket gate), <b>a</b> <b>stool</b> or a tree stump as the wicket. The invention of the game could have happened in Norman or Plantagenet times anytime before 1300; or even in Saxon times before 1066.|$|E
5|$|In 1635, without {{reference}} to a general assembly of the Parliament, the King authorised a book of canons that made him head of the Church, ordained an unpopular ritual and enforced {{the use of a}} new liturgy. When the liturgy emerged in 1637 it was seen as an English-style Prayer Book, resulting in anger and widespread rioting, said to have been set off with the throwing of <b>a</b> <b>stool</b> by one Jenny Geddes during a service in St Giles Cathedral. The Protestant nobility put themselves {{at the head of the}} popular opposition. Representatives of various sections of Scottish society drew up the National Covenant on 28 February 1638, objecting to the King's liturgical innovations. The King's supporters were unable to suppress the rebellion and the King refused to compromise. In December of the same year, at a meeting of the General Assembly in Glasgow, the Scottish bishops were formally expelled from the Church, which was then established on a full Presbyterian basis.|$|E

This is especially prevalent in dentists who perform much of their work from a seated position. We examined the use of <b>an</b> ergonomic dental <b>stool</b> with mid-sternum chest support for reducing lower back muscle activation. Electromyography of lower back extensors was assessed from 30 dental students for 20  s during three conditions in random order: (a) sitting upright at 90 ° of hip flexion on <b>a</b> standard <b>stool,</b> (b) leaning forward at 80 ° of hip flexion on <b>a</b> standard <b>stool,</b> and (c) leaning forward at 80 ° of hip flexion while sitting on <b>an</b> ergonomic <b>stool.</b> Muscular activity of the back extensors was reduced when using the ergonomic stool compared to the standard stool, by 33 - 50 % (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). This suggests a potential musculoskeletal benefit with use of <b>a</b> dental <b>stool</b> with mid-sternum chest support...|$|R

5|$|In 1936, {{with the}} help of a friend, the then 28-year-old Ho set up shop in Chinatown with only a comb, <b>a</b> <b>stool,</b> and a {{kerosene}} lamp. She worked from 8am to 3am, charging five cents to comb hair or weave plaits and buns for amahs and Samsui women. She did that every day for almost three decades, interrupted only by periods when she was incapacitated by acute attacks of arthritis. She scrimped and saved, and by the time she was in her 40s, she had enough to buy a shophouse in Club Street. Although illiterate, she made some property investments and eventually became a landlord, renting out rooms. As her wealth grew, she acquired more properties, and she began to adopt children from poor families, becoming a single mother of six daughters and twenty-five godchildren.|$|E
5|$|The second chorus has {{the girls}} {{dancing on the}} table, {{knocking}} several pieces of food and tuppleware onto the ground. A-Chan is seen lying down on a pillow, whilst Kashiyuka balances a book and an apple on her head. Both of these scenes have them throwing several pieces of food onto the table. Nocchi is seen at the dining table, holding a fork and listen to music through her headphones. She witnesses a small door underneath <b>a</b> <b>stool,</b> opens it, and sees a small green room. In the room, a blurred image of a cup starts to become clear, and holds small candy. As the girls eat the pieces of candy, their cream-coloured dresses turn into the outfits from the cover sleeve from the single. The girls start dancing in the fish bowl, surrounded by glittery lights. The final scene has the girls looking through the small door again, only to witness {{the dining room table}} empty; the small cup with candy appears in beige colouring rather than full-on vibrancy.|$|E

25|$|Two {{species of}} hookworms that {{commonly}} infect humans are Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. Hookworm eggs {{occur in the}} stool of infected people. If these {{end up in the}} environment, they can hatch into immature worms, which can then penetrate the skin. One type can also be spread through contaminated food. Risk factors include walking barefoot in warm climates where sanitation is poor. Diagnosis is by examination of <b>a</b> <b>stool</b> sample with a microscope.|$|E
