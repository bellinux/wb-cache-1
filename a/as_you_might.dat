I decided to make myself a good case history of such a human being and it meant that I could not be judge of what was valid to put in or not. I must put everything in, so I started a very rigorous record.|$|E

He said, [...] "We made {{a very different kind of}} film, which was shot a great deal on location. We travelled quite far, we built sets, and they spend a lot of time in a forest," [...] he explained. [...] "We built forest sets and integrated them into the real forests, so there were challenges there, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> imagine." [...] Craig was ultimately nominated for an Academy Award for his work on Part 1.|$|E
500|$|When {{he began}} work on the score for A New Beginning, Manfredini created a theme just for the {{character}} of Tommy Jarvis. The idea was {{to suggest that there}} was [...] "madness afoot", which he believed helped to [...] "'point the finger' at various characters [...] to suggest that things were not <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> expect". For Jason Lives, Tom McLoughlin instructed Manfredini to create a score that would not alert the audience about what was happening or about to happen, [...] "but instead allow the audience to do it to themselves". McLoughlin took this idea from John Carpenter's 1978 film Halloween, which would always follow any shock in the film with Carpenter's [...] "Eeeeeeee!" [...] sound. McLoughlin wanted something more subtle, with a [...] "Gothic" [...] resonance.|$|E
500|$|... "Victory of the Daleks" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews. It {{received a}} positive review from Daniel Martin of The Guardian. Martin called it [...] "the best [...] Gatiss {{has written for}} the show", and praised the writer's investigation of [...] "the idea of [...] as 'man-made' war machines" [...] for not being [...] "as heavy-handed <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have expected". He also was positive towards the acting of McNeice and Paterson, the developing storyline between the Doctor and Amy, and positively compared the Daleks' menace to the first series. Patrick Mulkern of the Radio Times hailed the episode as [...] "a victory for all", and praised Gatiss for the character of Professor Bracewell, commenting favourably on how the writer [...] "turns him into an emotive robot like Star Treks Data, and gives Bill Paterson material worthy of his status." ...|$|E

500|$|The video {{received}} {{a positive response}} from critics following its release. Rachel Sonis of Idolator wrote that the video was [...] "just as fantastic and strange you’d expect", and Pusey said that Candy [...] "has well and truly outdone herself". Candy was described as performing [...] "Sister Wife realness" [...] in the visual by NewNowNext's Adam Salandra, who praised it as being as [...] "visually mesmerizing <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> expect". Mike Wass commended the video as being Candy's [...] "her most outrageous yet", highlighting the fashion and the singer's [...] "passion for outrageous visuals". [...] A writer from Promonews.tv found the visual to a [...] "creative new take" [...] on Western fashion, pop music videos, and nudity, comparing it {{to the work of}} American film director Russ Meyer. Mimi Davies called the video a [...] "raw, disturbing depiction of sister-wives taking revenge on their male oppressor".|$|E
500|$|As {{the album}} was not {{released}} outside of Sweden, it attracted little attention from overseas music critics. However, John Lucas did review the album on behalf of AllMusic, writing that [...] "there are no truly weak moments" [...] and praised it for being [...] "much more organic and mature" [...] than Robyn Is Here. On the other hand, he felt it lacked [...] "instant" [...] and [...] "irresistible" [...] hooks and criticised the [...] "uniformity of sound that can make some songs drift in and out without really making any impression". He concluded, [...] "Not a commercial blockbuster then, nor a perfect listen, but this album does mark an important step forward for Robyn as an artist." [...] A negative opinion came from music critic Robert Christgau, who considered My Truth [...] "as strained <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> fear", and used it {{as an example of}} Robyn's [...] "awkward stage that hits teenpop stars like clockwork".|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN Movies {{gave the}} film {{two out of}} five stars. He was unhappy with the little screen time Bell and Elwes had been given, saying that the time the film did spend with them didn't have much impact. He said the traps were a step down from Saw VI, but did point out his {{favorite}} and highlight of the film as the [...] "garage trap". About the film's 3D effects, Goldman said [...] "The 3D is used <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> {{expect it to be}} – which is to say, this is no James Cameron immersive experience. Instead, blades jut out of the screen, and there is some fun had with blood and guts literally shooting forward at several points". [...] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed review. He said Saw 3D is [...] "consistent both stylistically and thematically with previous editions", but said most of the film's traps lack the [...] "Rube Goldberg-style cleverness that marked the series". [...] Scheck {{went on to say that}} it was [...] "unfortunate" [...] the creators killed Bell's character so early in the series and called Mandylor's character (Hoffman) an [...] "exceedingly bland stand-in". He called the visual impact of the 3D [...] "negligible".|$|E

500|$|A genetically {{enhanced}} superhuman {{who used}} {{his strength and}} intellect to briefly rule much of Earth in the 1990s. Montalbán said that he believed all good villains do villainous things, but {{think that they are}} acting for the [...] "right" [...] reasons; in this way, Khan uses his anger at the death of his wife to justify his pursuit of Kirk. The film was close to production approval when it occurred to the producers that no one had asked Montalbán whether he was interested in appearing in the film despite his character having been in the scripts for more than a year. Montalbán was unsure whether he could plausibly play Khan again after many years, especially given his current role of Mr. Roarke on Fantasy Island. Contrary to speculation that Montalbán used a prosthetic chest, no artificial devices were added to emphasize Montalbán's muscular physique, since even in his 60s and despite an increasingly painful back injury, stemming from being thrown off a horse in the 1950s, Montalbán had a vigorous workout routine. Montalbán enjoyed making the film, and counted the role as a career highlight. His major complaint was that he was never face-to-face with Shatner for a scene. [...] "I had to do my lines with the script girl, who, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> imagine, sounded nothing like Bill ," [...] he explained.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the video}} {{received}} positive response from critics. James Montgomery of MTV News {{said that the}} video [...] "is undoubtedly indebted to {{the past few decades}} of pop-cultural history...yet, once again, he's managed to create something entirely new, too". He added that, [...] "thanks to Pinto's wattage, [...] "Gorilla" [...] goes to heights — and depths — Mars has never visited before". Billboards Jason Lipshutz found Mars supporting [...] "a more R-rated side" [...] in the video, calling the cameos by Freida Pinto and Luis Guzman unforgettable. Carl Williot of the website's Idolator thought that the new video maintained the [...] "sweaty nightclub vibe" [...] style from the previous video [...] "Locked Out of Heaven". Additionally, she felt there is a story centered on Isabella, the new dancer, and Mars, which obviously upset [...] "the club’s veteran strippers". The Times of India newspaper considered the video {{one of the most controversial}} of 2013 because of [...] "Freida Pinto strip act". Ray Rahman of Entertainment Weekly opined that [...] "Bruno Mars is getting real" [...] since the video was set on a strip club and featured Freida Pinto striping, licking guitars and getting intimate with Mars. Lauren Kreisler of Official Charts Company praised the video concept and concluded that it was [...] "racy <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have expected". The video for [...] "Gorilla" [...] broke the 1 million views mark in just over an hour in 2013 on the exclusive Facebook program premiere, [...] "#NowPlaying".|$|E

[...] However, {{he did make}} a good living by touring the country conducting and charging sponsoring organizations for [...] "King Meetings" [...] in which he explained to packed houses how to build and use his road drag. Wittenberg-educated Ward was, by all accounts, an eloquent speaker. His promotional brochure claimed that [...] "An address on this subject is not, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> suppose, dry and uninteresting.

McKinley Noble of GamePro also made mention of the impressive water dynamics, adding that the game's challenge rooms extend gameplay. Joystiq, however, was not impressed with the effects, stating [...] "the water isn't even as impressive <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> expect." [...] Peter Eykemans of TeamXbox stated that the dynamic water made each enemy confrontation unique, allowing the player to dispatch enemies in a variety of ways. Official Xbox Magazines staff praised the dynamic and emergent gameplay, stating [...] "the more you experiment with them, the more Hydrophobia's dynamic environments come to life".|$|E
2500|$|Kitty Empire of The Guardian {{wrote about}} [...] "Gasolina" [...] as {{a song that}} has [...] "a spendidly {{infectious}} lurch". She also stated {{that the rest of}} the album [...] "doesn't let up" [...] by [...] "updating the subgenre of Spanish-language hip-hop with a new swagger". An editor of the Indian music magazine The Record wrote a mixed review of Barrio Fino, stating that anyone who is not intimidated by the Spanish language barrier [...] "will find this to be a good album," [...] praising his [...] "strong rhyming skills". The reviewer criticizes the record because it [...] "is not nearly as catchy or accessible <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have expected it to be" [...] but says that Daddy Yankee almost [...] "lives up to the promise of the hype surrounding him".

2500|$|Blade Runner sold well, {{but due to}} high {{development}} costs, {{the profit}} margin was low. According to Louis Castle, [...] "The mere fact it was four CDs made it a very expensive game. And the deal we had with the Blade Runner Partnership meant it was not terribly profitable. It didn't do as well <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> think." [...] Although Virgin were interested in doing a sequel, if a sequel were approved, the Blade Runner Partnership intended to increase the licensing fee. Ultimately, Westwood and Virgin concluded the cost of producing a game to top the original, coupled with the increased cost for licensing, made {{the prospect of a}} sequel economically untenable, as such a sequel would have to sell several million units to generate what would be considered an acceptable profit. In 2009, the Blade Runner Partnership offered Gearbox Software the rights to the franchise, but production costs were estimated at $35 million and the project was scrapped.|$|E
2500|$|As Billy Pilgrim becomes [...] "unstuck in time," [...] he {{is faced}} with {{a new type of}} philosophy. When Pilgrim becomes acquainted with the Tralfamadorians, he learns a {{different}} viewpoint concerning fate and free will. While Christianity may state that fate and free will are matters of God’s divine choice and human interaction, Tralfamadorianism would disagree. According to Tralfamadorian philosophy, things are and always will be, and there is nothing that can change them. When Billy asks why they had chosen him, the Tralfamadorians reply, [...] "Why you? Why us for that matter? Why anything? Because this moment simply is." [...] The mindset of the Tralfamadorian is not one in which fate and free will exist. Things happen because they were always destined to be happening. The narrator of the story explains that the Tralfamadorians see time all at once. This concept of time is best explained by the Tralfamadorians themselves, as they speak to Billy Pilgrim on the matter stating, [...] "I am a Tralfamadorian, seeing all time <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> see a stretch of the Rocky Mountains. All time is all time. It does not change. It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations. It simply is." [...] After this particular conversation on seeing time, Billy makes the statement that this philosophy does not seem to evoke any sense of free will. To this, the Tralfamadorian reply that free will is a concept that, out of the [...] "visited thirty-one inhabited planets in the universe" [...] and [...] "studied reports on one hundred more," [...] exists solely on Earth.|$|E
2500|$|My first {{innings in}} Test cricket was, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> expect, a trying experience, but {{proved to be}} one of the best cricket lessons of my career, thanks to Ian Redpath. I came to the wicket with Australia reeling at 5/107 to join [...] "Redders", who had watched three quick wickets fall at the other end. Illingworth and Snow, sensing that one more wicket would see them through our batting line up, stepped up their attack on the senior member of our partnership. [...] "Snowy" [...] {{concentrated}} his attack short of a length on [...] "Redders" [...] off-stump, with a liberal sprinkling of shorter pitched balls for good measure. Ian made a point of not playing at anything he didn't have to and ducked or swayed away from the shorter deliveries. Each time he swayed or ducked he came back to the upright position and sneered at [...] "Snowy". It may not have looked all that pretty, but it was pretty effective as both Illingworth and Snow became more and more frustrated. Ian's example at the other end made me feel that if it meant that much to him to keep his wicket intact then I had better make sure I try just as hard at my end to keep mine intact. Fortunately we both succeeded and our partnership put us into a sound position, but from my point of view I had received an invaluable lesson in what Test match batting was all about from one of the most courageous batsmen ever to play for Australia.|$|E
