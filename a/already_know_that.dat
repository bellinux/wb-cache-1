5|$|The {{opening of}} the council took place on 21 March 1148 at Reims Cathedral on a Sunday. Eugene and his attendants had arrived in Reims by 9 March. The main {{business}} of the council was the debate {{on a number of}} canons, or rules, for the church that would be announced. Most of these were not new decrees, having been promulgated by Eugene's predecessor at the councils of Reims in 1131 and at the Lateran council of 1139. All of the proposed canons were approved, except for one on clerical attire which was opposed by Rainald of Dassel and other German ecclesiastics. This canon had prohibited cloaks made of fur. Another canon condemning clerical marriage was greeted with amusement, as the council members felt that all clergy should <b>already</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> marriage was forbidden to them.|$|E

Such speakers typically use falling pitch for yes/no questions for which they already are quite sure of the answer.

Available to buy for $2.99 on CollegeHumor and Facebook and for $13 on DVD, the special was the company's first paid content. Its plot involves the fictitious new CEO of CollegeHumor, Alan Avery (Matt Walton), promoting Jake and firing Amir; Jake realizes this was a mistake, and the two try to get Amir's job back. Sam Reich, CollegeHumor Media's President of Original Content said [...] "Fired is very much {{an extension of the}} Jake and Amir that people <b>already</b> <b>know.</b> ... <b>That</b> being said, it also expands the universe considerably by adding characters, locations, and something even newer to a Jake and Amir plot." ...|$|E

2500|$|The typical {{method of}} proving {{a problem to}} be {{undecidable}} is with the technique of reduction.

[...] Since we <b>already</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> no method can decide the old problem, no method can decide the new problem either. Often the new problem is reduced to solving the halting problem. (Note: the same technique is used to demonstrate that a problem is NP complete, only in this case, rather than demonstrating that there is no solution, it demonstrates there is no polynomial time solution, assuming P ≠ NP).|$|E

It is the simplest plan to use the train itself as reference-body (co-ordinate system). An observer in the train measures the interval by marking off his measuring-rod in a straight line (e.g. along the floor of the carriage) as many times as is necessary to take him from the one marked point to the other. Then the number which tells us how often the rod has to be laid down is the required distance.|$|E

He had been much surprised at the Coroner's verdict; he could not think how twelve men on their oath could call Ussher's death murder, when it so evidently appeared to him that the man stigmatised by that verdict as a murderer, had only been actuated by the praiseworthy purpose of defending his sister from disgrace and violence; and when, moreover, it was so plain that Thady's presence on the scene at the moment was accidental, and that the attack could not have been premeditated.|$|E
6000|$|Dear Mr. Casaubon,--In {{the course}} of an {{investigation}} which my researches into the character of the Etruscan [...] "Involuti" [...] have necessitated, I frequently encounter the root Kad, k2ad, or Qad. Schnitzler's recent and epoch-making discovery that d in Etruscan = b2, has led me to consider it a plausible hypothesis that we may convert Kad or Qad into Kab2, in which case {{it is by no means}} beyond the range of a cautious conjecture that the Involuti are identical with the Cab-iri (Cabiri). Though you will pardon me for confessing, what you <b>already</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that</b> I am not in all points an adherent to your ideas concerning a [...] "Key to All Mythologies" [...] (at least, as briefly set forth by you in Kuhn's Zeitung), yet I am deeply impressed with this apparent opportunity of bridging the seemingly impassable gulf between Etrurian Religion and the comparatively clear and comprehensible systems of the Pelasgo- Phoenician peoples. That Kad or Kab can refer either (as in Quatuor) to a four-footed animal (quadruped, [...] "quad") or to a four- wheeled vehicle (esseda, Celtic cab) I cannot for a moment believe, though I understand that this theory has the support of Schrader, Penka, and Baunder. {10} Any information which your learning can procure, and your kind courtesy can supply, will be warmly welcomed and duly acknowledged.--Believe me, faithfully yours, ...|$|E
60|$|The fact is that, {{in simple}} {{mathematical}} judgements such as 'two and two are four', {{and also in}} many judgements of logic, we can know the general proposition without inferring it from instances, although some instance is usually necessary to make clear to us what the general proposition means. This is why there is real utility {{in the process of}} deduction, which goes from the general to the general, or from the general to the particular, {{as well as in the}} process of induction, which goes from the particular to the particular, or from the particular to the general. It is an old debate among philosophers whether deduction ever gives new knowledge. We can now see that in certain cases, at least, it does do so. If we <b>already</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> two and two always make four, and we know that Brown and Jones are two, and so are Robinson and Smith, we can deduce that Brown and Jones and Robinson and Smith are four. This is new knowledge, not contained in our premisses, because the general proposition, 'two and two are four', never told us there were such people as Brown and Jones and Robinson and Smith, and the particular premisses do not tell us that there were four of them, whereas the particular proposition deduced does tell us both these things.|$|E
