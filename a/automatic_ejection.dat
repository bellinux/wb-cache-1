25|$|The Suns {{began the}} 2006 Western Conference Playoffs as {{favorites}} against the Los Angeles Lakers. After winning Game 1 in Phoenix, {{they found themselves}} trailing in the series 3–1 after impressive performances by Laker shooting guard Kobe Bryant. However, the Suns {{went on to win}} three straight games. They won Game 5 easily at home. With 7:33 left in the game, Suns guard Raja Bell grabbed Bryant around the neck and threw him down as the Lakers star drove to the basket. Bell earned a technical foul, his second of the game, and an <b>automatic</b> <b>ejection.</b> The Suns took game 6 in OT, their first OT win all season despite 50 points from Bryant and Bell out serving a one-game suspension (for a flagrant foul against Bryant in Game 5) with last second help from mid-season acquisition Tim Thomas. On their home court, the Suns won Game 7 121–90, eliminating the Lakers {{for the first time since}} 1993. The Suns became only the eighth team in NBA history to win a playoff series after being behind 3–1.|$|E

50|$|The {{choice between}} bolt-action and {{semi-automatic}} (more {{commonly known as}} recoil or gas operation) is usually determined by specific requirements of the sniper's role in a particular organization, with each design having advantages and disadvantages. For a given cartridge, a bolt-action rifle is cheaper to build and maintain, more reliable, and lighter, due to fewer moving parts in the mechanism. In addition, the absence of uncontrolled <b>automatic</b> cartridge case <b>ejection</b> helps avoid revealing the firer's position. Semi-automatic weapons can serve both as battle rifle and sniper rifle, and allow for a greater rate (and hence volume) of fire. As such rifles may be modified service rifles, an additional benefit can be commonality of operation with the issued infantry rifle. A bolt action is most commonly used in both military and police roles due to its higher accuracy and ease of maintenance. Anti-materiel applications such as mine clearing and special forces operations tend to use semi-automatics.|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{developed}} an automatic quantitative algorithm for {{the measurement of}} regional myocardial wall motion and wall thickening from three-dimensional gated technetium- 99 m sestamibi myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomographic images. Background. The algorithm measures {{the motion of the}} three-dimensional endocardial surface using a modification of the centerline method, as well as wall thickening using both geometry (gaussian fit) and partial volume (counts). Methods. The algorithm was tested using a “variable thickness” heart phantom, and the quantitative results were compared with visual segmental assessment of myocardial motion and thickening in 79 clinical patients {{with a wide range of}} ejection fractions (6 % to 87 %). Results. Phantom measurements of simulated motion and thickening were accurate regardless of the camera used (dual or triple detector), the angular span of reconstructed data (180 ° or 360 °), the amount of motion (3 or 6 mm) or the amount of thickening (33 %, 50 % or 100 %). Quantitative measurements of segmental motion and thickening in the patients were correlated with visual scores (r = 0. 668, exact agreement 72. 6 %, kappa 0. 433 and r = 0. 550, exact agreement 74. 7 %, kappa 0. 408, respectively). Significant inverse linear relations exist between the global (summed) visual motion score and the average quantitative motion, and between the global (summed) visual thickening score and the average quantitative thickening. <b>Automatic</b> quantitative <b>ejection</b> fraction measurements correlated extremely well with average quantitative motion (r = 0. 929) and thickening (r = 0. 959).

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} of an <b>Automatic</b> Coronal Mass <b>Ejection</b> (CME) Detection tool (AICMED) for the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI). CMEs observed with heliospheric imagers are much more difficult to detect than those observed by coronagraphs as they have a lower contrast compared with the background light, have a larger range of intensity variation and are easily confused with other transient activity. CMEs appear in SMEI images as very faint often-fragmented arcs amongst a much brighter and often variable background. AICMED operates along the same lines as Computer Aided CME Tracking (CACTus), using the Hough Transform on elongation-time J-maps to extract straight lines from the data set. We compare AICMED results with manually measured CMEs on almost three years of data from early in SMEI operations. AICMED identified 83 verifiable events. Of these 46 could be matched with manually identified events, the majority of the non-detections can be explained. The remaining 37 AICMED events were newly discovered CMEs. The proportion of false identification was high, at 71 % of the autonomously detected events. We find that AICMED is very effective as a region of interest highlighter, and is a promising first step in autonomous heliospheric imager CME detection, but the SMEI data are too noisy for the tool to be completely automated...|$|R
