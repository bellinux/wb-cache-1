6000|$|... "Then, {{in order}} that the {{confidence}} between us may be complete, let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> <b>question,</b> Why have you brought this matter to us, instead of leaving it to the ordinary authorities?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me," [...] remarked Philip, [...] "this is very interesting. Let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> <b>question,</b> though. If {{you were}} so sure of your facts, why didn't you arrest me at once instead of just {{watching}} me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> before," [...] he said [...] "but Monsieur Grisson {{is anxious}} {{to hear it from}} your own lips. To how many people did <b>you</b> tell <b>this</b> little {{adventure}} of yours before you reached Paris?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, Annette, {{you have}} {{conducted}} yourself well, {{and are very}} expert in your métier. But why do <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>this</b> <b>question,</b> just at <b>this</b> moment?" ...|$|R
6000|$|WISE. As {{quietly as}} a lamb. There {{seemed not to}} be in it, to standers by, so as a strong {{struggle}} of nature. And as for his mind, it seemed to be wholly at quiet. But, pray, why do <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me <b>this</b> <b>question?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your Majesty," [...] he said. [...] "We accept. Yet {{with your}} {{permission}} I would <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> <b>question.</b> No man in Theos loves his country better than Nicholas of Reist. If he should desire to recall his words----?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{begin to}} have hopes," [...] he {{acknowledged}} frankly, [...] "that I have been drawn into another mare's nest. Nevertheless, I am bound to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> <b>question,</b> Miss Abbeway. Did you leave your room at all during last night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You look honest," [...] she said. [...] "Perhaps you are. Perhaps I have doubted {{you without}} a cause. But I will <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> <b>question.</b> Has it been {{suggested}} {{to you by}} any of them that you should watch us--my uncle and me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Wise. As {{quietly as}} a {166b} Lamb. There {{seemed not to}} be in it, to standers by, so much as a strong {{struggle}} of Nature: and as for his Mind, it seemed to be wholly at quiet. But pray why do <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me <b>this</b> <b>question?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know you," [...] she answered. [...] "For myself, I admit it. When I am {{with a man}} who is nice, I {{try that}} I may make him, just a little, no more, but just a little in love with me. It makes things more amusing. It is better for him, and we are not bored. But with you, mon ami, I know very well that I waste my time. And so, I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> instead <b>this</b> <b>question.</b> Tell me why you have invited me to take luncheon with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{not argue}} with you, lad," [...] his uncle declared. [...] "I'll <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> no'but <b>this</b> one <b>question,</b> {{and before you}} answer it just go back in your mind to the night we stood outside my shack, when {{the wind was blowing}} up from the valleys. Are you going to stand by your pledged word {{or are you going to}} play me false?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Harrison," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "there is {{no doubt}} that you have done what you {{conceived}} to be your duty, although I must tell you frankly that I wish you had either kept what you know to yourself or taken the information somewhere else. Since you have brought it to me, let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> <b>question.</b> Are you taking any further steps in the matter at all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If that {{is really}} your opinion of us, Prince," [...] he said, [...] "it is useless to enter into {{argument}} with you, especially as you have already acted upon your convictions. I should like to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> <b>question,</b> though. A few weeks ago an appeal was made to our young men to bring up to its full strength certain forces which have been organized for the defence of the country. Do {{you know how many}} recruits we obtained in less than a month?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Maraton," [...] he said, [...] "now I {{am going}} to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> <b>question.</b> To-morrow you go to Manchester to {{pronounce}} your doctrines. To-morrow {{you are going to}} incite the working people of England practically to revolt. Are you going to tell them that it is for posterity they must strike? Do you mean, when you thunder at them from the platforms, to tell them the truth?--to tell them that the good which you promise is not for them nor for their children, nor their children's children, but for the unborn generations? Do you mean to tell them this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> plainly, Mr. Bragg, {{it shall}} be {{answered}} with equal sincerity. Mr. Effingham {{is a man of}} mature years; the known child, executor, and heir of one who, it is admitted all round, was the master of the controverted property. Knowing his own business, this Mr. Effingham, in sight of the grave of his fathers, beneath the paternal roof, has the intolerable impudence--" ...|$|R
2500|$|Wilson, {{a disciple}} of Walter Bagehot, {{considered}} the United States Constitution to be cumbersome {{and open to}} corruption. Wilson favored a parliamentary system for the United States {{and in the early}} 1880s wrote, [...] "I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to put <b>this</b> <b>question</b> to yourselves, should we not draw the Executive and Legislature closer together? Should we not, on the one hand, give the individual leaders of opinion in Congress a better chance to have an intimate party in determining who should be president, and the president, on the other hand, a better chance to approve himself a statesman, and his advisers capable men of affairs, in the guidance of Congress." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the month}} of December 1678, Saint-Mars, the commandant of the prison, brought to Fouquet a sealed letter from Louvois, the seal unbroken. His own reply was also to be sealed, {{and not to be}} seen by Saint-Mars. Louvois wrote that the King wished to know one thing, before giving Fouquet ampler liberty. Had his valet, Eustache Dauger, told his other valet, La Riviere, what he had done before coming to Pignerol? (de ce a quoi il a ete employe auparavant que d'etre a Pignerol). 'His Majesty bids me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> [Fouquet] <b>this</b> <b>question,</b> and expects that you will answer without {{considering}} anything but the truth, that he may know what measures to take,' these depending on whether Dauger has, or has not, told La Riviere the story of his past life.* Moreover, Lauzun was never, said Louvois, to be allowed to enter Fouquet's room when Dauger was present. The humorous point is that, thanks to a hole dug in the wall between his room and Fouquet's, Lauzun saw Dauger whenever he pleased.|$|R
6000|$|... "Prince," [...] he said, [...] "this {{is perhaps}} {{the last time that}} we shall all meet {{together}} in this way. You go from us direct to the seat of your Government. So far there has been very little plain speaking between us. It would perhaps be more in accord with etiquette if we let you go without a word, and waited for a formal interchange of communications between your Ambassador and ourselves. But we have a feeling, Sir Edward and I, that we should {{like to talk to you}} directly. Before we go any further, however, let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> <b>question.</b> Have you any objection, Prince, to discussing a certain matter here with us?" ...|$|E

Introduction: I see {{gathered}} before me here today, a body of people whose intellectual ability, I presume, would make a fair standard by which to measure the intelligence of like gatherings in any part of the civilized world. Yet, fellow-citizens and fellow-students, I believe, that were I to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> this afternoon, nine-tenths of you would answer without the least hesitancy, we are!

For {{such a man}} {{has lived}} in the sunshine of your presence for eight happy weeks, and now, when his holiday is done, he finds that the old solitude will be more sorrowful than ever, unless he can discover whether his summer dream will change into a beautiful reality. Miss Dora, I have very little to offer you; a faithful heart to cherish you, a strong arm to work for you, an honest name to give into your keeping,--these are all; but if they have any worth in your eyes, they are most truly yours forever." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ōfuna had a {{reputation}} for intimidation and for torturing their inmates in an attempt to get military information, and was nicknamed the [...] "Torture Farm" [...] by its inmates. As the prisoners sent to Ōfuna were primarily officers, who might have inside knowledge of Allied Strategy, or others working in critical areas such as communications and submarines, it was the goal of the Japanese to extract as much information as possible in a short time. The names of the prisoners held at Ōfuna was not divulged to the Red Cross, and the camp was so secret that even local inhabitants were not aware of its existence. As relayed to a submarine prisoner: [...] "You have survived the sinking of a submarine. No one survives the sinking of a submarine. No one knows you're alive. We're going to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>questions.</b> <b>This</b> man and this man are going to shoot you if you don't answer the questions, and no one will know you were alive." [...] In some cases, the inmates were told by their captors that they were regarded as war criminals, since 90 percent of the crews of the merchant vessels sunk by American submarines were civilians, and that as war criminals, they would be given only half the rations as normal prisoners of war.|$|R

6000|$|... "For the present, nevertheless," [...] he said, [...] "let me remain Mr. Sabin to him also. I do not <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> {{without a}} purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] he murmured. [...] "And now, having reached {{just this}} stage in our conversation, let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> <b>You</b> read the newspapers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But since I am here," [...] he continued, [...] "and {{since we}} have met again, I must <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> Your husband is trying to divorce you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite!" [...] {{said the}} Angel, with relief. [...] "I forgot to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> morning how the ancient custom of {{marriage}} was now regarded in the large?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Louis," [...] I said, [...] "let me <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> Presuming things {{remain as}} they are, and I act independently, {{do you intend}} to prevent my seeing Miss Delora?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] cried Constance excitedly. [...] "I must know, I must <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> <b>This</b> is my mother's name, Jean Constance Irving, {{can it be}} {{possible}} she was your little Jeannie?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To see you," [...] she answered. [...] "I want to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> Arnold. <b>You</b> wish Monsieur Feurgéres to go free. You wish to stay my hand. What price are {{you willing}} to pay?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But don't {{you think}} it would be nice," [...] said the lady, [...] "if you were to come to lunch with us to-morrow? It was to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> that I inquired for you at the toll-gate." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What the {{mischief}} can I {{do about}} it?" [...] Hebblethwaite demanded irritably. [...] "You are putting {{me in an}} impossible position.

"Young lady," [...] he said, [...] "I will <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> I do {{not wish}} to seem obstinate in my refusal to accept Craig's guilt as proved, but I would like to put <b>this</b> simple <b>question</b> to <b>you.</b> Did Craig's {{demeanour}} during your conversation seem to you to indicate the master criminal?
