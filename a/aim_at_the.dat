5|$|Comstock and {{his allies}} also took <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> libertarians and utopians who {{comprised}} the free love movement– an initiative to promote sexual freedom, equality for women, and abolition of marriage. The free love proponents were the only group to actively oppose the Comstock laws in the 19th century, {{setting the stage for}} the birth control movement.|$|E

5|$|Once at war, Turkey joined Germany {{in taking}} <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{opposing}} Entente Powers and their extensive empires in the Muslim world. Enver Pasha had the Sultan proclaim jihad. His hope was to provoke and aid a vast Muslim revolution, particularly in India. Translations of the proclamation {{were sent to}} Berlin for propaganda purposes, for distribution to Muslim troops of the Entente Powers. However, while widely heard, the proclamation {{did not have the}} intended effect of mobilising global Muslim opinion on behalf of Turkey or the Central Powers.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Super Punch-Out!! {{is similar}} to that of its arcade and NES/FC predecessors. The player controls a nameable boxer as he fights his way to become W.V.B.A. Champion. The player controls the boxer from a third-person perspective, with him being translucent on the screen. Players can attack their opponents with jabs to the face or with body blows from either hand. The opponent can deflect punches, so players must <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> opponent's open spot (where the gloves are not) to connect. Depending on the opponents' stances, they will guard themselves differently, so players need to use the correct punches.|$|E
5|$|Unable to find wind {{machines}} {{powerful enough}} to mimic hurricane-force winds, Sertner brought in a jet engine to <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> actors and props during necessary scenes. Three dimensional storyboards, called animatics, were used to allow the filmmakers {{to see what a}} scene would look like before shooting, using a digital version of the actors. The various weather scenes blended together stock footage of real natural disasters with the computer-generated shots, with care taken to match up the details of the various scenes.|$|E
5|$|By October 1797, {{the plan}} to attack Ireland had been {{abandoned}} and the British North Sea Fleet was again at full strength. During a brief period replenishing supplies at Yarmouth, news reached Duncan on 10 October that the Dutch had sailed on a raiding cruise and {{he returned to the}} Dutch coast, intercepting de Winter's fleet on its way back to the Texel. The Dutch formed a line of battle in shallow coastal waters to meet Duncan's attack, which was conducted in a confused mass, the British fleet separating into two groups that struck the vanguard and rear of the Dutch fleet, overwhelming each in turn and capturing eleven ships, including de Winter's flagship Vrijheid. On the return journey, three of the captured ships were lost, and none of the surviving Dutch prizes was ever suitable for active service again. Both sides suffered heavy casualties during the battle as each fleet had been trained to <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hulls of their opponents, maximising the damage to personnel.|$|E

5|$|Severely damaged, Tripoli {{struck her}} colors to {{indicate}} surrender. As Enterprise moved towards the vessel to accept its surrender, the Tripolitans hoisted their flag and fired upon Enterprise. The Tripolitans again attempted {{to board the}} American schooner, but were repelled by Enterprise broadsides and musketry. After another exchange of fire, the Tripolitans struck their colors a second time. Sterett once more ceased firing and moved closer to Tripoli. In response, Rous again raised his colors and attempted to board Enterprise. Enterprise accurate gunnery once more forced Tripoli to veer off. As the action continued, Rous perfidiously feigned a third surrender {{in an attempt to}} draw the American schooner within grappling range. This time, Sterett kept his distance, and ordered Enterprise guns to be lowered to <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> polacca's waterline, a tactic that threatened to sink the enemy ship. The next American broadsides struck their target, causing massive damage, dismasting her mizzen-mast, and reducing her to a sinking condition. With most of his crew dead or wounded, the injured Admiral Rous finally threw the Tripolitan flag into the sea to convince Sterett to end the action.|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} took direct <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Communist party in 1948 when it indicted its top twelve {{leaders in the}} Foley Square trial. The case hinged {{on whether or not}} mere membership in a totalitarian political party was sufficient to conclude that members advocated the overthrow of the United States government. The ACLU chose to not represent any of the defendants, and they were all found guilty and sentenced to three to five years in prison. Their defense attorneys were all cited for contempt, went to prison and were disbarred. When the government indicted additional party members, the defendants could not find attorneys to represent them. Communists protested outside the courthouse; a bill to outlaw picketing of courthouses was introduced in Congress, and the ACLU supported the anti-picketing law.|$|E
5|$|Woodfull {{started the}} season strongly, scoring 74 and 83 {{in a loss}} to New South Wales in the second match of the summer, but was soon confronted by Jardine's Englishmen. He made five and 25 as England crushed Victoria by an innings. Although England did <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> batsmen's body, they did not enforce {{the second half of}} the Bodyline structure, by not packing the leg side. This changed in the next match, when Woodfull led an Australian XI against the {{tourists}} in Melbourne, in what was effectively a Test rehearsal. With Jardine rested from the match, his deputy Bob Wyatt used the full Bodyline tactics for the first time. The match was drawn and Woodfull struggled, making 18 and a duck. Utilising his hopping technique and attempting to play unorthodox shots resembling overhead tennis smashes, Bradman failed to make an impact, and England were buoyed ahead of the Tests.|$|E

25|$|However, consequentialism {{and virtue}} ethics {{need not be}} entirely antagonistic. Philosopher Iain King has {{developed}} an approach which reconciles the two schools. Other consequentialists consider effects {{on the character of}} people involved in an action when assessing consequence. Similarly, a consequentialist theory may <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> maximization of a particular virtue or set of virtues. Finally, following Foot's lead, one might adopt a sort of consequentialism that argues that virtuous activity ultimately produces the best consequences.|$|E
25|$|The {{pre-existing}} communes, which periodically redistributed land, {{did little}} to encourage improvement in technique, and formed a source of power {{beyond the control of}} the Soviet government. Although the income gap between wealthy and poor farmers did grow under the NEP, it remained quite small, but the Bolsheviks began to take <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wealthy kulaks. Clearly identifying this group was difficult, though, since only about 1% of the peasantry employed laborers (the basic Marxist definition of a capitalist), and 82% of the country's population were peasants.|$|E
