5|$|Graphical user {{interfaces}} (GUIs) may be developed using Perl. For example, Perl/Tk and WxPerl {{are commonly used}} to enable user interaction with Perl scripts. Such interaction may be synchronous or <b>asynchronous,</b> using callbacks to update the GUI.|$|E
5|$|Related work on {{this model}} {{concerns}} deposition in which the arrival times of additional particles are random, rather than having particles arrive at all local minima simultaneously. These stochastic growth processes can be modeled as an <b>asynchronous</b> cellular automaton.|$|E
5|$|In early 2011, Qualcomm {{announced}} a new processor architecture called Krait, which used the ARM v7 instruction set, but was based on Qualcomm's own processor design. The processors were called S4 and had a feature named <b>Asynchronous</b> Symmetrical Multi-Processing (aSMP), meaning each processor core adjusted its clock speed and voltage based on the device's activity in order to optimize battery usage. Prior models were renamed to S1, S2 and S3 to distinguish each generation.|$|E
5|$|Whereas <b>Asynchronous</b> Transfer Mode (ATM) or Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) {{are typical}} data-link {{protocols}} for larger networks such as WANs; Ethernet and Token Ring are typical data-link protocols for LANs. These protocols {{differ from the}} former protocols {{in that they are}} simpler, e.g., they omit features such as quality of service guarantees, and offer collision prevention. Both of these differences allow for more economical systems.|$|E
25|$|Experiments {{have shown}} that <b>asynchronous</b> {{hatching}} may also reduce sibling rivalry. Experimentally manipulated synchronous broods produced more aggressive chicks; chicks in <b>asynchronous</b> broods were less violent. This pattern of behavior arguably occurs through a clearly established brood hierarchy in asynchronously hatched siblings. Although <b>asynchronous</b> hatching is not vital {{for the formation of}} brood hierarchies (the experimentally synchronous broods established them as well), it does aid in efficient brood reduction when food levels are low. Subordinate chicks in <b>asynchronous</b> broods die more quickly, thus relieving the parents of the burden of feeding both offspring when resources are insufficient to properly do so.|$|E

25|$|CSP message-passing {{fundamentally}} {{involves a}} rendezvous between the {{processes involved in}} sending and receiving the message, i.e. the sender cannot transmit a message until the receiver is ready to accept it. In contrast, message-passing in actor systems is fundamentally <b>asynchronous,</b> i.e. message transmission and reception {{do not have to}} happen at same time, and senders may transmit messages before receivers are ready to accept them. These approaches may be considered duals of each other, in the sense that rendezvous-based systems can be used to construct buffered communications that behave as <b>asynchronous</b> messaging systems, while <b>asynchronous</b> systems can be used to construct rendezvous-style communications by using a message/acknowledgement protocol to synchronize senders and receivers.|$|E

25|$|In 1894, Hungarian {{engineer}} Kálmán Kandó {{developed a}} new type 3-phase <b>asynchronous</b> electric drive motors and generators for electric locomotives. Kandó's early 1894 designs were first applied in a short three-phase AC tramway in Evian-les-Bains (France), which was constructed between 1896 and 1898.|$|E
25|$|For {{customers}} with more demanding requirements (such as medium-to-large businesses, or other ISPs) can use higher-speed DSL (such as single-pair high-speed digital subscriber line), Ethernet, metropolitan Ethernet, gigabit Ethernet, Frame Relay, ISDN Primary Rate Interface, ATM (<b>Asynchronous</b> Transfer Mode) and synchronous optical networking (SONET).|$|E
25|$|ISO 9141-2. This {{protocol}} has an <b>asynchronous</b> {{serial data}} rate of 10.4kbit/s. It is somewhat similar to RS-232; however, the signal levels are different, and communications happens on a single, bidirectional line without additional handshake signals. ISO 9141-2 is primarily used in Chrysler, European, and Asian vehicles.|$|E
25|$|For {{exploring}} large patterns {{at great}} time-depths, sophisticated algorithms such as Hashlife may be useful.

25|$|A {{model that}} {{is closer to}} the {{behavior}} of real-world multiprocessor machines and takes into account the use of machine instructions, such as Compare-and-swap (CAS), is that of <b>asynchronous</b> shared memory. There is a wide body of work on this model, a summary of which {{can be found in the}} literature.|$|E
25|$|SDRAM latency is not {{inherently}} lower (faster) than <b>asynchronous</b> DRAM. Indeed, early SDRAM {{was somewhat}} slower than contemporaneous burst EDO DRAM {{due to the}} additional logic. The benefits of SDRAM's internal buffering come from its ability to interleave operations to multiple banks of memory, thereby increasing effective bandwidth.|$|E
25|$|For {{conservation}} biology purposes, metapopulation models must include (a) the finite nature of metapopulations (how many patches {{are suitable for}} habitat), and (b) the probabilistic nature of extinction and colonisation.

25|$|Following {{the rules}} above. It {{can be derived}} that the changes at 10 and 30 occur {{simultaneously}} and the changes in intensity at 20 and 40 occur simultaneously as well. Because of the positive <b>asynchronous</b> cross-peak at (10, 20), the changes at 10 and 30 (predominantly) occur before the intensity changes at 20 and 40.|$|E
25|$|Alternative caching {{strategies}} {{can be used}} for data that would otherwise cause delays in data handling. For example, synchronous writes which are capable of slowing down the storage system can be converted to <b>asynchronous</b> writes by being written to a fast separate caching device, known as the SLOG (sometimes called the ZIL – ZFS Intent Log).|$|E
25|$|An {{induction}} motor is an <b>asynchronous</b> AC motor where power {{is transferred to}} the rotor by electromagnetic induction, much like transformer action. An {{induction motor}} resembles a rotating transformer, because the stator (stationary part) is essentially the primary side of the transformer and the rotor (rotating part) is the secondary side. Polyphase induction motors are widely used in industry.|$|E
25|$|Electric {{machines}} {{that rely on}} induction or <b>asynchronous</b> principles short-circuit one port of the transformer circuit and as a result, the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit becomes dominant as slip increases, which limits the magnitude of active (i.e., real) current. Still, bursts of torque that are {{two to three times}} higher than the maximum design torque are realizable.|$|E
25|$|Long running {{processing}} capability enables the architecture to collect various <b>asynchronous</b> events {{over a long}} period of time and correlate these events into causal relationships. SOA 2.0 event patterns can be designed and implemented to look for event relationships that span days, weeks, or months; and when certain criteria are met, trigger a business process to address the event pattern.|$|E
25|$|The design {{principles}} {{developed for}} the AGC by MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, directed in late 1960s by Charles Draper, became foundational to software engineering—particularly {{for the design of}} more reliable systems that relied on <b>asynchronous</b> software, priority scheduling, testing, and human-in-the-loop decision capability. When the design requirements for the AGC were defined, necessary software and programming techniques did not exist so it had to be designed from scratch.|$|E
25|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} – {{the liver}} does not clear ammonia and related nitrogenous substances from the blood, which are {{carried to the}} brain, affecting cerebral functioning: neglect of personal appearance, unresponsiveness, forgetfulness, trouble concentrating, changes in sleep habits or psychosis may result.

25|$|Two-dimensional {{infrared}} {{correlation spectroscopy}} analysis combines multiple samples of infrared spectra to reveal more complex properties. By extending the spectral information of a perturbed sample, spectral analysis is simplified and resolution is enhanced. The 2D synchronous and 2D <b>asynchronous</b> spectra represent a graphical {{overview of the}} spectral changes due to a perturbation (such as a changing concentration or changing temperature) {{as well as the}} relationship between the spectral changes at two different wavenumbers.|$|E
25|$|The {{blue-footed booby}} usually lays {{one to three}} eggs at a time. The species {{practices}} <b>asynchronous</b> hatching, in contrast to many other species whereby incubation begins when the last egg is laid and all chicks hatch together. This results in a growth inequality and size disparity between siblings, leading to facultative siblicide in times of food scarcity. This makes the blue-footed booby an important model for studying parent-offspring conflict and sibling rivalry.|$|E
25|$|The brand became AMD FireStream {{with the}} second {{generation}} of stream processors in 2007, based on the RV650 chip with new unified shaders and double precision support. <b>Asynchronous</b> DMA also improved performance by allowing a larger memory pool without the CPU's help. One model was released, the 9170, for the initial price of $1999. Plans included {{the development of a}} stream processor on an MXM module by 2008, for laptop computing, but was never released.|$|E
