5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} silk {{was found at}} the sites of Yangshao culture in Xia County, Shanxi, where a silk cocoon was found cut in half by <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>knife,</b> dating back to between 4000 and 3000 BCE. The species was identified as Bombyx mori, the domesticated silkworm. Fragments of primitive loom {{can also be seen}} from the sites of Hemudu culture in Yuyao, Zhejiang, dated to about 4000 BCE. The earliest example of silk fabric is from 3630 BC, and was used as wrapping for the body of a child. The fabric comes from a Yangshao site in Qingtaicun at Rongyang, Henan. Scraps of silk were found in a Liangzhu culture site at Qianshanyang in Huzhou, Zhejiang, dating back to 2700 BCE. Other fragments have been recovered from royal tombs in the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600 – c. 1046 BCE).|$|E

Small pieces of yellow PVC tape were attached to her body and both of her breasts had been removed using <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>knife.</b> Her handbag and driver's licence were stolen during the attack. The murder weapon and Patterson's breasts have never been recovered.|$|E
25|$|Each seed is clasped {{by a thin}} wing 2 to 4 {{times as}} long as the seed. Seed and wing are appressed to the cone scale. Embryo and {{megagametophyte}} are soft and translucent at first; later the endosperm becomes firm and milky white, while the embryo becomes cream-colored or light yellow. At maturity, the testa darkens rapidly from light brown to dark brown or black (Crossley 1953). Mature seed “snaps in two” when cut by <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>knife</b> on a firm surface (Crossley 1953).|$|E
25|$|It was {{cut into}} three {{sections}} on 10February1908 by Asscher Brothers of Amsterdam and eventually into nine large stones {{and a number}} of smaller ones. At the time, technology had not yet evolved to guarantee the quality of modern standards, and cutting the diamond was difficult and risky. To enable Asscher to cleave the diamond in one blow an incision half an inch (1.27cm) deep was made. Then <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>knife</b> was placed in the incision and the diamond was split clean in two with a piece of steel along one of four possible cleavage planes. The Cullinan split through a defective spot which was shared in both halves of the diamond.|$|E

500|$|Editor Nick Lowe noticed theater posters done by Scott McKowen {{and decided}} that the [...] "engraving 'look' of the {{scratchboard}} would be interesting for the historical setting of this story." [...] Scratchboard is a technique where <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>knife</b> is used to scrape through a layer of black ink to a hard chalk surface underneath; in effect, artists draw white lines on an all-black surface. All McKowen's illustrations were done by hand and then colored later in Photoshop. For inspiration, McKowen looked at seventeenth-century engravings. He also added scrolls or flags to the covers for the Marvel 1602 titles, basing the designs on Renaissance paintings where scrolls are used {{to comment on the}} scenes depicted.|$|E
500|$|In Iron Age and Early Medieval Northern Europe, {{the term}} blót {{referred}} to animal sacrifice performed {{to thank the}} deities and gain their favor. Such sacrifices have generally proved impractical for most modern practitioners, {{due to the fact}} that skills in animal slaughter are not widely taught, while the slaughter of animals is regulated by government in Western countries. In 2007 Strmiska noted that a [...] "small but growing" [...] number of Heathen practitioners in the U.S. had begun performing animal sacrifice as a part of blót. Those who do so typically follow the procedure outlined in the Heimskringla: the throat of the sacrificial animal is slashed with <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>knife,</b> and the blood is collected in a bowl before being sprinkled onto both participants of the rite and statues of the gods. Animals used for this purpose have included poultry as well as larger mammals like sheep and pigs, with the meat then being consumed by those attending the rite. Some practitioners have made alterations to this procedure: Strmiska noted two American Heathens who decided to use a rifle shot to the head to kill the animal swiftly, a decision made after they witnessed a blót in which the animal's throat was cut incorrectly and it slowly died in agony; they felt that such practices would have displeased the gods and accordingly brought harm upon those carrying out the sacrifice.|$|E

50|$|Compared to {{conventional}} European knives such as J. A. Henckels or Wusthof, Global knives {{are made from}} a significantly harder alloy of steel, use a thinner blade, and are ground to a narrower angle. The angle that is achieved is a steep 15°, this produces <b>a</b> <b>sharper</b> <b>knife</b> which keeps its edge longer and allows for more accurate work, but takes longer to sharpen when it becomes dull. Because of this, the manufacturer recommends using whetstones and ceramic sharpening rods {{as opposed to the}} European sharpening steel. In addition, Global knives are renowned for their light weight and even balance, a trait achieved by hollowing out the handle during production.|$|R
2500|$|Beak {{trimming}} {{was developed}} at the Ohio Experiment Station in the 1930s. [...] The original technique was temporary, cutting approximately 6mm (1/4 inch) off the beak. It was thought that {{the tip of the}} beak had no blood supply and presumably no sensation. The procedure was performed by hand with <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>knife,</b> either when deaths due to cannibalism became excessive, or when the problem was anticipated because of a history of cannibalism in the particular strain of chicken.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2009, {{security}} features were increased on [...] "Machin" [...] self-adhesive stamps {{to avoid the}} reuse of uncancelled used stamps retrieved on mail. Both the effigy and the background were printed with continuous [...] "ROYAL MAIL" [...] iridescent printing. Two ellipsoidal shear panels were added to each stamp, and the water-soluble layer between the stamp and the adhesive was abandoned. These two later features were intended to render the stamps difficult to take off mail and to store for reuse (but in effect are easily overcome by the careful use of <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>knife</b> edge). Collectors are advised not to attempt to soak such stamps off, but to save them on pieces cut from the envelope.|$|E
2500|$|A {{distinction}} {{may be made}} {{based on}} whether the defendant chose to become intoxicated, and is thus responsible for their diminished control, or not. As an example, in the so-called Dutch courage defense (see the Gallagher case in English law on intoxication) the accused hates his spouse but fears to take action. The accused therefore buys a bottle of brandy and <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>knife.</b> In the morning, the bottle is empty and the knife is in the spouse's heart. Because the accused had a plan and weakening the inhibitions by drunkenness {{was a part of}} that plan, an intoxication defense is not feasible. But if, at a party, a bowl of fruit punch is [...] "spiked" [...] by someone who secretly adds gin, the resulting drunkenness is not voluntary and might be considered a possible defense. A sharper distinction is drawn in Islamic law, where involuntary distinction may remove criminal if not financial responsibility ...|$|E

2500|$|After the Council, Paul VI contributed in {{two ways}} to the {{continued}} growth of ecumenical dialogue. The separated brothers and sisters, as he called them, {{were not able to}} contribute to the Council as invited observers. After the Council, many of them took initiative to seek out their Catholic counterparts and the Pope in Rome, who welcomed such visits. But the Catholic Church itself recognized from the many previous ecumenical encounters, that much needed to be done within, to be an open partner for ecumenism. To those who are entrusted the highest and deepest truth and therefore, so Paul VI, believed that he had the most difficult part to communicate. Ecumenical dialogue, in the view of Paul VI, requires from a Catholic the whole person: one's entire reason, will, and heart. Paul VI, like Pius XII before him, was reluctant to give in on a lowest possible point. And yet, Paul felt compelled to admit his ardent Gospel-based desire to be everything to everybody and to help all people Being the successor of Peter, he felt the words of Christ, [...] "Do you love me more" [...] like <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>knife</b> penetrating to the marrow of his soul. These words meant to Paul VI love without limits, and they underscore the Church's fundamental approach to ecumenism.|$|E

50|$|A diamond <b>knife</b> is <b>a</b> very <b>sharp</b> <b>knife</b> {{in which}} the edge is made from diamond, invented by Humberto Fernández Morán in 1955.
