5|$|Fewer than 3% {{of people}} live more than {{fourteen}} years. Disease features {{significantly associated with}} reduced survival are an increased severity of cognitive impairment, decreased functional level, history of falls, and disturbances in the neurological examination. Other coincident diseases such as heart problems, diabetes or history of alcohol <b>abuse</b> <b>are</b> also related with shortened survival. While the earlier the age at onset the higher the total survival years, life expectancy is particularly reduced {{when compared to the}} healthy population among those who are younger. Men have a less favourable survival prognosis than women.|$|E
5|$|While RAD {{is likely}} to occur {{following}} neglectful and abusive childcare, {{there should be no}} automatic diagnosis on this basis alone as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors but on its own does not explain attachment disorder. Experiences of <b>abuse</b> <b>are</b> associated with the development of disorganised attachment, in which the child prefers a familiar caregiver, but responds to that person in an unpredictable and somewhat bizarre way. Within official classifications, attachment disorganization is a risk factor but not in itself an attachment disorder. Further although attachment disorders tend to occur in the context of some institutions, repeated changes of primary caregiver or extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder.|$|E

25|$|Sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>is</b> {{associated}} with psychological disturbance. Sequeira, Howlin & Hollins found that sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>was</b> {{associated with}} increased rates of mental illness and behavioural problems, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Psychological reactions to <b>abuse</b> <b>were</b> similar to those observed in the general population, but {{with the addition of}} stereotypical behaviour. The more serious the abuse, the more severe the symptoms that were reported.|$|R
40|$|Substance <b>abuse</b> <b>is</b> a {{major issue}} all around the world. It {{is an issue that}} not only affects the abuser but also affects {{individuals}} and entire communities as well. Substance <b>abuse</b> <b>is</b> often glamorized in media and, though there are some cases where it <b>is</b> not, substance <b>abuse</b> <b>is</b> all too often misrepresented. The issue of adolescent substance <b>abuse</b> <b>is</b> virtually ignored or, at the very least, is underrepresented in media. In a few cases where adolescent substance abuse does play a role in media, it is rarely the central issue. More often than not, the issue of adolescent substance <b>abuse</b> <b>is</b> a side concern, a subplot. Crossing the Tracks is a script for a pilot episode of a television series that gives adolescent substance abuse the attention it deserves while straying from the misrepresentative tendencies of it 2 ̆ 7 s predecessors...|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to determine associated characteristics of community-dwelling older persons, their access to care and social provisions, and self-reported elder abuse, and to assess how having help in completing a questionnaire affected these associations. A questionnaire was mailed to 1, 017 randomly selected elders in the Iowa Medicaid Waiver Program. The overall prevalence of self-reported <b>abuse</b> <b>was</b> 20. 9 %. Fifty-nine percent of respondents had help completing the questionnaire. <b>Abuse</b> <b>was</b> associated with low social provisions, more emergency room visits, being alone, and not having enough money. For those having help completing the questionnaire, <b>abuse</b> <b>was</b> associated with older age, low social provisions, being alone, and not having enough money. For those having no help completing the ques-tionnaire, <b>abuse</b> <b>was</b> associated with depression, being alone, more emer-gency room visits, and low social provisions.

25|$|Trauma {{models are}} {{typically}} {{founded on the}} view that traumatic experiences (such as actual physical or sexual <b>abuse)</b> <b>are</b> more common or more serious than thought in the histories of those diagnosed with mental disorders. Such models have traditionally been associated with psychoanalytic approaches, notably Sigmund Freud's early ideas on childhood sexual abuse and hysteria.|$|E
25|$|Social {{attitudes towards}} child sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>are</b> {{extremely}} negative, with some surveys ranking it as morally worse than murder.

About half of people develop PTSD following rape. Children are less likely than adults to develop PTSD after trauma, especially if they are under ten years of age.

The Society's One of the family empathy education programme was started in 2007, backed by New Zealand celebrity Norm Hewitt, in response to research indicating that a large percentage of criminals begin abusing animals in early life.|$|E
25|$|Belief in {{the supernatural}} is strong {{in all parts}} of India, and lynchings for {{witchcraft}} are reported in the press from time to time. Around 750 people were killed as witches in Assam and West Bengal between 2003 and 2008. Officials in the state of Chhattisgarh reported in 2008 that at least 100women are maltreated annually as suspected witches. A local activist stated that only a fraction of cases of <b>abuse</b> <b>are</b> reported. In Indian mythology, a common perception of a witch is a being with her feet pointed backwards.|$|E

25|$|Group {{psychological}} abuse refers to groups where methods of psychological <b>abuse</b> <b>are</b> frequently or systematically used on their members. Such abuse would be practices that treat the members as objects one {{is free to}} manipulate instead of respecting their autonomy, human rights, identity and dignity. In a group they may also play mind games with another person that can make the victim seem like they are accepted, but in actuality are backstabbing the person when his/her back is turned. When the victim requests assistance from the abusing group it is not given.|$|E
25|$|In popular usage, {{the word}} pedophilia is often applied to any sexual {{interest}} in children or {{the act of}} child sexual abuse. This use conflates the sexual attraction to prepubescent children with the act of child sexual abuse, and fails to distinguish between attraction to prepubescent and pubescent or post-pubescent minors. Researchers recommend that these imprecise uses be avoided because although people who commit child sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>are</b> sometimes pedophiles, child sexual abuse offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children, and some pedophiles do not molest children.|$|E
25|$|In March 2013, a {{submission}} {{was made}} to Victoria's parliamentary inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse involving criticism of the college's alleged history of institutionalised brutalisation and sexual abuse of children in its care in the 1960s and 1970s. The inquiry is expected to hand over testimony to a concurrent Royal Commission. The inquiry heard that one victim who reported an incident of corporal punishment to the head was threatened with a strap to the face, although {{it should be noted}} that this allegation related to corporal punishment and not sexual abuse.

25|$|Because only 3 of the 7 DSM-IV {{criteria}} for alcohol dependence are required, not all patients meet the same criteria {{and therefore not}} {{all have the same}} symptoms and problems related to drinking. Not everyone with alcohol dependence, therefore, experiences physiological dependence. Alcohol dependence is differentiated from alcohol abuse by the presence of symptoms such as tolerance and withdrawal. Both alcohol dependence and alcohol <b>abuse</b> <b>are</b> sometimes referred to by the less specific term alcoholism. However, many definitions of alcoholism exist, and only some are compatible with alcohol abuse. There are two major differences between alcohol dependence and alcoholism as generally accepted by the medical community.|$|E
25|$|Methamphetamine induces a {{psychosis}} in 26–46 {{percent of}} heavy users. Some {{of these people}} develop a long-lasting psychosis that can persist for longer than six months. Those {{who have had a}} short-lived psychosis from methamphetamine can have a relapse of the methamphetamine psychosis years later after a stress event such as severe insomnia or a period of heavy alcohol abuse despite not relapsing back to methamphetamine. Individuals who have long history of methamphetamine abuse and who have experienced psychosis in the past from methamphetamine <b>abuse</b> <b>are</b> highly likely to rapidly relapse back into a methamphetamine psychosis within a week or so of going back onto methamphetamine.|$|E
25|$|In some Central African areas, {{malicious}} magic {{users are}} believed by locals {{to be the}} source of terminal illness such as AIDS and cancer. In such cases, various methods are used to rid the person from the bewitching spirit, occasionally physical and psychological abuse. Children may be accused of being witches, for example a young niece may be blamed for the illness of a relative. Most of these cases of abuse go unreported since the members of the society that witness such <b>abuse</b> <b>are</b> too afraid of being accused of being accomplices. It is also believed that witchcraft can be transmitted to children by feeding. Parents discourage their children from interacting with people believed to be witches.|$|E
