5|$|Marge and Homer argue {{later that}} night. Homer tells Marge {{that even though}} getting the {{trampoline}} was a mistake <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> is willing to try new things, while she is boring and nags too much. Marge disagrees, but discovers that Bart and Lisa agree with Homer's assessment. She becomes annoyed and stays the night at Patty and Selma's house. While there, she is introduced to an infomercial featuring self-help guru Brad Goodman, who supposedly can help her with her chronic nagging. After Marge and Homer watch a Brad Goodman video, Marge is more tolerant {{and the two of}} them get along better. Observing how out of control Bart is, they take the family to see Brad Goodman's live lecture in the hopes that it will change him. Bart interrupts the lecture, and Brad Goodman encourages the town to follow Bart's spontaneous attitude. Soon, the whole town begins to act like Bart, which means Bart's rebellious ways are no longer unique, putting him in a slump.|$|E
25|$|He {{appears as}} Archdeacon of Lothian in {{documents}} from 1386, an extremely prestigious position (or claim <b>at</b> <b>least)</b> <b>he</b> {{appears to have}} lost by 1390, when the position is securely held by another. Other honours held before the episcopate, excluding Mortlach, include the church of Liston (by November 1391), previously held by Gilbert de Greenlaw, {{and the office of}} sub-dean of Brechin.|$|E
25|$|His brief {{experience}} of the first-class game {{was something of a}} disaster: Yorkshire, who would go on to the County Championship title, crushed their opponents by an innings and 220 runs inside two days, while Bunting himself made 1 and 0 with his four overs of leg-spin disappearing for 38 runs. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> took a catch, to dismiss George Macaulay.|$|E

25|$|Haslewood {{played in}} three matches for Cambridge University that have later been {{judged to be}} {{first-class}} games: one {{in each of the}} 1833, 1834 and 1835 seasons. He batted in the lower order and in the 1835 match <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> bowled, because he is recorded as taking wickets in that game; scorecards for his other matches are incomplete, so {{it is not possible to}} determine his exact role, nor whether he batted or bowled right- or left-handed.|$|E
25|$|Hall {{was a man}} of {{independent}} means and seems to have been careless of fame; <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> took no trouble to communicate his invention to the world. At a trial in Westminster Hall about the patent rights granted to John Dollond (Watkin v. Dollond), Hall was admitted to be the first inventor of the achromatic telescope. However, it was ruled by Lord Mansfield that it was not the original inventor who ought to profit from such invention, but the one who brought it forth for the benefit of mankind.|$|E

He has acquired a correct knowledge of their manner of living, and speaks their language fluently. He has rose (sic?) to be quite a considerable character, or chief, in their village; <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> assumes all the dignities of a chief, for he has four wives, with whom he lives alternately.|$|E

25|$|Wang Wei {{never lived}} to see the empire return to peace, as the An-Shi {{disturbances}} and their aftermath continued beyond his lifetime. However, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> could enjoy a relative return to stability compared to the initial years of the rebellion, especially {{when he had the}} opportunity to spend time in the relative seclusion of his Lantian estate, which allowed him both a poetic and a Buddhist retreat, as well as a place to spend time with his friends and with nature, painting and writing. But, finally, his writing came to an end, and in the seventh month of 759, or in 761, Wang Wei requested writing implements, wrote several letters to his brother and to his friends, and then died. He was then buried at his Lantian estate.|$|E
25|$|Career {{records for}} batting average are usually {{subject to a}} minimum {{qualification}} of 20 innings played or completed, in order to exclude batsmen who have not played enough games for their skill to be reliably assessed. Under this qualification, the highest Test batting average belongs to Australia's Sir Donald Bradman, with 99.94. Given that a career batting average over 50 is exceptional, and that only four other players have averages over 60, this is an outstanding statistic. The fact that Bradman's average is so far above {{that of any other}} cricketer has led several statisticians to argue that, statistically <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> was the greatest sportsman in any sport. As at 21 October 2016, Adam Voges of Australia has recorded an average of 72.75 from 27 innings played, but only 20 innings completed.|$|E
25|$|Of his cathedral restorations, {{inspired}} as {{they were}} by the mistaken idea that a medieval church ought to be homogeneous in style and unencumbered by screens, monuments, and other obtrusive relics of the past, {{it can only be}} said that the Chapters who employed him were no more enlightened than their architect, and that at Westminster Abbey <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> accomplished an urgent work of repair in an unexceptionable manner. His activities at Salisbury, Durham, Hereford, and Lichfield were bitterly criticized by John Carter in his Pursuits of Architectural Innovation, and it was due in large measure to Carter's persistent denunciation that, in 1796, Wyatt failed to secure election as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In the following year, however, he was permitted to add F.S.A. to his name by a majority of one hundred and twenty-three votes.|$|E

5000|$|Commenting on the horse's later career, Barron said in 2004 [...] "It was a {{thorn in}} my side for a bit after he went, and I didn't enjoy seeing him run, but time is a great healer, and now he's with Paul Dixon and <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he's</b> got a good home" ...|$|R
25|$|In 1992 Hick {{finally made}} a Test half-century, 51 against Pakistan, {{but as with}} the West Indian series he was dropped {{before the end of}} the summer. This time <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> scored heavily for Worcestershire, {{averaging}} nearly seventy for his county. This domestic form, together with his ability against spin bowling, secured Hick a place on the 1992–93 tour of India, and in a generally disastrous tour for England (they lost two Tests by an innings and the other by eight wickets) he was one of the very few bright spots; indeed, he topped both batting and bowling averages for his country, as well as scoring 249 runs in the six ODIs. The personal highlight for Hick was his long-awaited maiden Test hundred: 178 in the third Test at Bombay; he added another 47 in the second innings. He then scored 68 and 26 in the one-off Test against Sri Lanka which immediately followed. For his achievements in the subcontinent, he was named one of Indian Crickets five Cricketers of the Year in 1993.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1960s and 1970s, three left arm spinners {{dominated}} the Indian domestic cricket scene. Along with Doshi there were, Padmakar Shivalkar from Bombay, & Rajinder Goel of Haryana & Delhi. Goel still holds {{the record for}} the highest number of wickets in the Ranji Trophy (640 at 17.14). Shivlakar holds the record for his team Mumbai. Years after years, they destroyed strong batting line ups in Indian cricket with the guile of their spin, only to be overlooked by the national selectors. The only reason was the presence of B.S. Bedi. With a world class left arm spinner readily available, the selectors were reluctant to give the others much chance. Thus, Shivalker and Goel had to content themselves with a few unofficial test matches against Sri Lanka. Goel was specially unlucky, {{in the sense that he}} was originally selected to make his official Test Debut against WI at Delhi, in 1974–78. But a last minute change saw off spinner Venkat replacing him. Doshi, in that sense, can be considered to be the luckiest; <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> got the chance to represent India in full internationals. Nevertheless, he too lost the best years of his playing career waiting for his chance to come.|$|E
500|$|Santa Barbara Independent {{journalist}} Brian Tanguay {{wrote in}} his book review that Taibbi was [...] "the spiritual heir of legendary presidential campaign scribes" [...] including Hunter S. Thompson and Timothy Crouse. Tanguay said of Taibbi's writing style, [...] "Taibbi is incisive and often incredibly funny as he recounts the foibles of candidates and the long, enervating presidential primary process." [...] He observed, [...] "A veteran of four presidential campaigns, Taibbi knows how the game works. Or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> knew until Trump came." [...] Tanguay's review concluded, [...] "Insane Clown President is a valuable work {{about one of the}} most bizarre electoral outcomes in American history." ...|$|E

The next day, Jim jokes about their [...] "first date", and Pam, in an unexpectedly blunt tone, tells him it was not a date. Surprised and obviously disappointed, Jim makes an unwise comment that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> didn't leave her at a high school hockey game, in reference to Pam's earlier revelation of what Roy had done on her worst date ever. Pam is clearly upset and gets up to go send some faxes, leaving it awkward between her and Jim, who tries unsuccessfully to apologize.|$|E
500|$|Sears {{lived in}} Wellsboro from 1844 {{until his death}} in 1890, and was the first to {{describe}} the Pine Creek Gorge. He also described a trip to what became Leonard Harrison State Park: after a [...] buggy ride, he then had to hike [...] through tangles of fallen trees and branches, down ravines, and over banks for five hours. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> reached [...] "The Point", which he wrote was [...] "the jutting terminus of a high ridge which not only commands a capital view of the opposite mountain, but also of the Pine Creek Valley, up and down for miles". [...] A Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC) state historical marker commemorating Nessmuk was dedicated in the park in 1972.|$|E
500|$|As {{a senator}} Hatfield took {{positions}} {{that made him}} hard to classify politically. In the Summer of 1969, he had told Murray Rothbard that he had [...] "committed himself {{to the cause of}} libertarianism." [...] Rothbard remarked concerning Hatfield, [...] "obviously his voting record is not particularly libertarian—it's very good on foreign policy and the draft, but it's not too great on other things", adding that [...] "in the abstract, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> is very favorable to libertarianism." [...] Hatfield was pro-life on the issues of abortion and the death penalty, though as governor he chose not to commute the sentence of a convicted murderer and allowed that execution to go forward. As a prominent evangelical Christian, he opposed government-sponsored school prayer and supported civil rights for minorities.|$|E

500|$|In the August 1917 {{edition of}} the {{magazine}} Electrical Experimenter, Tesla postulated that electricity {{could be used to}} locate submarines via using the reflection of an [...] "electric ray" [...] of [...] "tremendous frequency," [...] with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen (a system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to modern radar). Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high frequency radio waves would penetrate water. Émile Girardeau, who helped develop France's first radar system in the 1930s, noted in 1953 that Tesla's general speculation that a very strong high-frequency signal would be needed was correct. Girardeau said, [...] "(Tesla) was prophesying or dreaming, since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out, but one must add that if he was dreaming, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> was dreaming correctly." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{television}} advert for Homme by David Beckham, {{which was}} directed by Anthony Mandler, opens to see Beckham [...] "showing off his physical prowess" [...] as he runs topless along a platform. As he reaches {{the edge of the}} platform, Beckham dives into a vat of the fragrance. In the next scene he is fully dressed in one of his trademark tailored suits. Beckham appeared in a sketch on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to promote the fragrance. In the sketch he is [...] "almost unrecognisable" [...] as he stood in the cosmetics aisle at a Target store, offering passing customers a sample spray of the scent. Homme by David Beckham was included in Esquires list of the best colognes for men in 2011.

500|$|Due to {{the troubled}} {{development}} of Kill the Irishman, Reid {{decided to make}} a documentary about Greene's life; known as Danny Greene: the Rise and Fall of the Irishman. Due to the research he had done for the movie, Reid became specialized in the Northern Ohio crime scene and Greene’s life. Reid felt that by doing the documentary, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> could go to his [...] "grave 'saying I tried'". In 2009, with 17 hours of the documentary shot, Reid was told his film had been green-lit. He joined forces with production company Code Entertainment and engaged with a [...] "reliable" [...] director; Jonathan Hensleigh. They then signed actors Val Kilmer and Christopher Walken to the project. This was followed by the signing of actors Vincent D’Onofrio (Full Metal Jacket), Paul Sorvino (Goodfellas), and Irish actor Ray Stevenson, respectively. Stevenson was filming The Book of Eli when he got a telephone call from Hensleigh, so they arranged to meet in Los Angeles. According to Stevenson, he was drawn to the script and immediately made a deal.|$|E
