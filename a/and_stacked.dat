5|$|As a ceratopsid, Achelousaurus {{would have}} been a quadrupedal animal with hoofed digits and a shortened, {{downwards}} swept tail. Its very large head, which would have rested on a straight neck, had a hooked upper beak, very large nasal openings and long tooth rows developed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of appressed <b>and</b> <b>stacked</b> individual teeth. In the tooth sockets, new teeth grew under the old ones, each position housing a column of teeth posed on top of each other. Achelousaurus had 25 to 28 such tooth positions in each maxilla (upper jaw bone).|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus, {{best known}} through L. lambei, was {{quite similar to}} Corythosaurus in {{everything}} but {{the form of the}} head adornment. Compared to Corythosaurus, the crest of Lambeosaurus was shifted forward, and the hollow nasal passages within were {{at the front of the}} crest <b>and</b> <b>stacked</b> vertically. It also can be differentiated from Corythosaurus by its lack of forking nasal processes making up part of the sides of the crest, which is the only way to tell juveniles of the two genera apart, as the crests took on their distinctive forms as the animals aged.|$|E
5|$|In August 1947, Chadwick {{was killed}} in the crash of the Avro Tudor 2 {{prototype}} and was succeeded by Sir William Farren. Reductions in wing thickness made it impossible to incorporate the split bomb bays <b>and</b> <b>stacked</b> engines, thus the engines were placed side-by-side in pairs either side of a single bomb-bay, with the fuselage growing somewhat. The wingtip fins gave way to a single fin on the aircraft's centreline. Rival manufacturer Handley Page received a prototype contract for its crescent-winged HP.80 B.35/46 tender in November 1947. Though considered the best option, contract placement for Avro's design was delayed whilst its technical strength was established. Instructions to proceed with the construction of two Avro 698 prototypes was received in January 1948. As an insurance measure against both radical designs failing, Short Brothers received a contract for the prototype SA.4 to the less-stringent Specification B.14/46; the SA.4, later named Sperrin, was not required. In April 1948, Vickers also received authority to proceed with their Type 660 which, although falling short of the B.35/46 Specification, being of a more conventional design would be available sooner; this plane entered service as the Valiant.|$|E

25|$|During {{the postwar}} years, {{there was a}} serious housing crisis, solved by the {{invention}} of high-rise apartments. There are over 11,000 of these standardised and prefabricated apartment blocks, housing the majority of Moscow's population, making it by far the city with the most high-rise buildings.

25|$|A {{classical}} marble facade with baroque scrolls {{decorate the}} partially subterranean vault. Double wrought iron doors have the words “PUBLIC VAULT” displayed {{by means of}} vent holes. The vault is constructed of Aquia Creek sandstone, which was also used to construct many important early structures in Washington, including the White House, the Capitol, and the Latrobe cenotaphs in the cemetery. The vault {{does not have any}} niches or shelves to hold coffins, rather the coffins were placed on the floor <b>and</b> <b>stacked</b> if necessary.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} making {{charcoal}} demanded great skill and vast quantities of trees. During winter months, wood was cut <b>and</b> <b>stacked.</b> When colliers selected a site for the hearth, they stacked the wood into a conical shape by standing the sticks on end around a central chimney. The dangerous job of firing and tending these hearths belonged to the collier {{and one or two}} helpers. These men usually managed as many as eight or nine hearths at one time. To keep the fires smoldering, fires were carefully controlled 24 hours a day for ten days to two weeks -the time needed to produce the charred wood or charcoal.|$|E
25|$|Among these trench-built solid-walled {{buildings}} were three that lay some distance {{west of the}} great hall, with the amphitheatrical structure Hope-Taylor {{referred to as the}} assembly-structure lying between them: a pair of rectangular buildings placed end to end with what {{appears to have been a}} wattle fence between them, and an associated building that Hope-Taylor interpreted as a kitchen. These three were the only buildings on the site oriented north-south rather than east-west, and were constructed at the same time as or shortly before the assembly-structure. They were destroyed along with the Great Enclosure around 633, after which a church was built at the east end of the site. The southern building of the pair Hope-Taylor was convinced was a temple. No pottery or other indications of normal domestic use were found in this building. Nor were scattered animal bones. The building had been constructed in two stages: the second was constructed around the first (which was one of the few buildings on the site not to have been burned down), using carefully finished carpentry and heavy buttresses similar to those of the great hall. Inside the inner wall, the trench had been left open or opened up to form a pit approximately 6 feet long and more than 1 foot wide, which was full of animal bones; these had been deposited in at least 9 layers <b>and</b> <b>stacked</b> against the wall above the pit after space ran out, and there were half again as many as were found elsewhere on the site. They were mostly bones of oxen, with an extremely high proportion of skulls, and evidently had mostly been slaughtered as young calves, when their meat would be tender, rather than either shortly after birth when male calves would be surplus to dairy farming or after reaching full growth and being usable as draft animals. There were three non-structural postholes from which the posts had been removed before the building was burned and demolished. In addition, outside the northwest corner of the building there was a pit 4 feet in depth in which a post had been placed; nothing was found here except unusually clayey soil compared to the rest of the site, and crushed animal teeth, probably from sheep or goats; numerous thin, pointed stakes had been driven into the ground around this feature. And south of the pit, on the west side of the building, were traces of the successive erection of at least four temporary huts. A smaller, similar set of traces lay to the west of the screen between that building and the one to the north. South of the temple building was a rectangular enclosure that appeared to have been unroofed. There was no door out to this area from the building; both buildings had doors on their two long, east and west sides. Finally, of the graves in the western cemetery area of the site, the northernmost 16 were grouped around the temple building; but no burials lay to the east of the enclosure, suggesting that was where the gate was. All but one body, a child who was buried doubled-over, were buried with their heads to the west. Hope-Taylor considered the burials associated with free-standing posts beside the building and pointed out that although the form of burialstretched out and without grave goodswould have been acceptable to Christians, the dating and association with the un-Christian building mean that at least some of the burials must have occurred during heathen times.|$|E

500|$|The slave {{houses were}} {{constructed}} out of tabby and {{built by the}} slaves probably in the 1820s or 1830s, although evidence exists that indicates {{two of them were}} inhabited by 1814. [...] Tabby was constructed of shells left over from Timucua middens, burned by the barrel-full in open pits or kilns, then pounded into lime particles, mixed with water, sand, and whole oyster or clam shells, then poured into wooden foundations about [...] high, and set to dry. The process was repeated <b>and</b> <b>stacked</b> until the desired height of the wall was reached. The floors of the kitchen house and the basement of the owner's house were also constructed of tabby. The material made the houses remarkably durable, resistant to weather and insects, better insulated than wood, and the ingredients were accessible and cheap, although labor-intensive. The slave quarters at Kingsley Plantation are widely considered some of the best surviving examples of the use of this building material.|$|E
500|$|The {{survival}} and rediscovery {{of this film}} was by happenstance in the Canadian gold rush town of Dawson City, in Yukon, Canada. Beginning in 1903, the Dawson Amateur Athletic Association began showing films and the unreturned films were deposited in the Canadian Bank of Commerce and stored in the Carnegie library's basement. The Dawson Amateur Athletic Association later converted a pool to an ice rink, but because of improper conversion the ice rink suffered from uneven temperatures {{in the middle of}} the rink. In 1929, Clifford Thomson, then-employed by the Canadian Bank of Commerce and also treasurer of the hockey association, solved the problem of the library's stock of film and the inadequate ice rink. Thomson took 500,000 feet of film <b>and</b> <b>stacked</b> the reels in the pool, covered the reels with boards and leveled the rink with a layer of earth. [...] Dawson Amateur Athletic Association continued to receive new nitrate films which would later fuel the destruction of the entire complex in a fire in 1951. The films stored under the ice rink were preserved and uncovered in 1978 when a new recreation center was being built. The Dawson City Collection films were collected and preserved, with these prints becoming the last surviving records of these studios. The surviving and incomplete print of The Girl of the Northern Woods was one of the films recovered at Dawson City.|$|E
