Caligula's political payments for support, generosity and extravagance had exhausted the state's treasury. Ancient historians state that Caligula began falsely accusing, fining and even killing individuals for the purpose of seizing their estates.|$|E

5|$|In June 1945, Bradman faced <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> <b>crisis</b> {{when the}} firm of Harry Hodgetts {{collapsed}} due to fraud and embezzlement. Bradman moved quickly to set up his own business, utilising Hodgetts' client list and his old office in Grenfell Street, Adelaide.

5|$|In the 2010s, Russia's economy {{suffered}} from <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> <b>crisis,</b> depressed oil prices, and international sanctions {{put into place}} during the Ukrainian crisis. With less disposable income to spend, citizens were forced to take drastic measures. In 2017, for instance, {{approximately half of the}} country's population was growing fruits and vegetables to supplement their diet, caused in part by a doubling in food prices in the preceding two years.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{returned}} to management in April 1999 with Division Three team Brighton & Hove Albion. The club {{were in the}} middle of <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> <b>crisis,</b> which had seen the board sell the Goldstone Ground just to stay afloat; on the pitch the club were facing a battle for their league status. His first full season as manager was a matter of consolidation as the club finished a respectable 11th, whilst Adams signed talent such as star striker Bobby Zamora. The £100,000 spent on Zamora was the only transfer outlay Adams made in building his squad.|$|E

5|$|Domitian's {{tendency}} towards micromanagement {{was nowhere}} {{more evident than}} in his financial policy. The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus {{at the time of his}} death has been fiercely debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign. Upon his accession he revalued the Roman currency dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the denarius from 90% to 98% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87grams to 3.26grams. <b>A</b> <b>financial</b> <b>crisis</b> in 85 forced a devaluation of the silver purity and weight to 93.5% and 3.04grams respectively.|$|E
5|$|During the Early Modern {{period of}} Swiss history, the growing {{authoritarianism}} of the patriciate families combined with <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> <b>crisis</b> {{in the wake}} of the Thirty Years' War led to the Swiss peasant war of 1653. In the background to this struggle, the conflict between Catholic and Protestant cantons persisted, erupting in further violence at the First War of Villmergen, in 1656, and the Toggenburg War (or Second War of Villmergen), in 1712.|$|E
5|$|Fowler {{suffered}} an aggravation of a pre-existing hip {{injury in the}} 2002–03 pre-season, and did not recover until December. Struggling to gain fitness, and seeing teammates sold off due to <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> <b>crisis,</b> Fowler's form and market value diminished. It was despite this decrease in form that he still, in total, scored 15 goals in 31 appearances for Leeds; achieving an impressive strike rate of just less than one goal every two games. In 2002–03, Leeds finished 15th in the Premier League and a severe financial crisis was developing.|$|E

5|$|The first deep-level tube railway, the City & South London Railway (C), {{opened in}} 1890. Its early success {{resulted}} in a rush of proposals to Parliament for other deep-level routes under the capital, but by 1901 only two more lines had opened: the Waterloo & City Railway (W) in 1898 and the Central London Railway (CLR) in 1900.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a two-country dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium(DSGE) model {{to investigate the}} transmission of <b>a</b> global <b>financial</b> <b>crisis</b> to <b>a</b> small open economy. Central to our framework are financial frictions that {{play a major role}} in the macroeconomic adjustment to global credit tightening. We find that small open economies hit by a sudden stop arising from financial distress in the global economy are likely to face a more prolonged crisis than when they experience <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> shock of domestic origin. This is because an important source of difficulty in responding to <b>a</b> global <b>financial</b> <b>crisis</b> is the inability of countries to export their way out of crisis due to the slump in world consumer demand initiated by the global financial distress -as is painfully experienced by many countries in contemporary times. Moreover, we show that the greater a country's trade integration with the rest of the world, the greater the fluctuation of its macroeconomic aggregates in response to <b>a</b> global <b>financial</b> <b>crisis.</b> sudden stops, <b>financial</b> <b>crises,</b> emerging markets. ...|$|R

5|$|Another crisis {{broke in}} September 1949 when the Air Force picked up {{signs of the}} Soviet Union's RDS-1 nuclear test. Bacher joined Oppenheimer, Parsons, General Hoyt Vandenberg, the Atomic Energy Commissioners and a British {{delegation}} under William Penney to discuss what to do. The recent devaluation of the British pound had already triggered <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> <b>crisis,</b> and there was concern about how the markets would react to the news. Oppenheimer and Bacher saw the evidence of a nuclear test as conclusive, and Bacher in particular came down strongly {{on the side of}} making a public announcement, as {{the number of people who}} already knew made a leak almost inevitable. Truman made the announcement a few days later.|$|E
5|$|Darlington {{reached the}} quarter-finals of the 1968 League Cup; drawn away to Brian Clough's Derby County, {{they took the}} lead, only to lose 5–4. During the 1970s the club had to apply for {{re-election}} to the League five times, and by 1982 they were facing <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> <b>crisis</b> which they survived thanks to fundraising efforts in the town. Three years later they won promotion by finishing third in the league under manager Cyril Knowles.

40|$|We {{develop a}} dynamic general {{equilibrium}} growth model with infinitely lived heterogeneous agents to describe <b>a</b> self-fulfilling <b>financial</b> <b>crisis</b> accompanied by <b>an</b> asset bubble burst as a rational expectations equilibrium. Because of financial market imperfections, asset bubbles appear under mild parameter conditions {{even though we}} assume infinitely lived agents. Although these bubbles have both a crowd-in liquidity effect and a crowd-out effect on investment, the former effect always dominates the latter. Thus, <b>a</b> self-fulfilling <b>financial</b> <b>crisis</b> accompanied by <b>an</b> asset bubble burst results in an economic recession. This phenomenon is consistent with empirical observations on <b>financial</b> <b>crises</b> in the existing literature. In addition, we present an effective government policy to avoid self-fulfilling <b>financial</b> <b>crises.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Maxwell reluctantly {{dropped his}} {{amalgamation}} plans, but retained his 19% stake in Reading. Under Smee's chairmanship, the team won promotion {{back from the}} Fourth Division {{at the end of}} the 1983–84 season, and won the Third Division title two years later, taking it into the Second Division. Smee remained at the helm until 1990, when amid <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> <b>crisis</b> at the club he sold it to John Madejski. Meanwhile, Maxwell made Oxford United profitable, and oversaw two successive promotions for the club during the 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. The team played in the First Division, then the top level of English football, for the first time during 1985–86, and won its first major trophy, the League Cup, in April 1986. Despite Maxwell's reservations about the Manor Ground, the club remained there throughout this time.|$|E
5|$|Professional theatre {{returned}} {{briefly to}} the East End in 1972, with {{the formation of}} the Half Moon Theatre in a rented former synagogue in Aldgate. In 1979, they moved to a former Methodist chapel, near Stepney Green and built a new theatre on the site, opening in May 1985, with a production of Sweeney Todd. The theatre enjoyed success, with premières by Dario Fo, Edward Bond and Steven Berkoff, but by the mid-1980s, the theatre suffered <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> <b>crisis</b> and closed. After years of disuse, it has been converted to a public house. The theatre spawned two further arts projects: the Half Moon Photography Workshop, exhibiting in the theatre and locally, and from 1976 publishing Camerwork, and the 'Half Moon Young People's Theatre', which remains active in Tower Hamlets.|$|E
5|$|Unlike England, Scotland had no towns {{dating from}} Roman occupation. From {{the twelfth century}} there are records of burghs, {{chartered}} towns, which became major centres of crafts and trade. and {{there is evidence of}} 55 burghs by 1296. There are also Scottish coins, although English coinage probably remained more significant in trade and {{until the end of the}} period barter was probably the most common form of exchange. Nevertheless, craft and industry remained relatively undeveloped before the end of the Middle Ages and, although there were extensive trading networks based in Scotland, while the Scots exported largely raw materials, they imported increasing quantities of luxury goods, resulting in a bullion shortage and perhaps helping to create <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> <b>crisis</b> in the fifteenth century.|$|E
