5|$|Upheaval {{within the}} band {{occurred}} from 1983 onwards. First Bill McDonough left, then his brother Guy McDonough died in 1984, then various other members left. Their 1985 release Between <b>a</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hard</b> Place was expensive but sales were disappointing; and they disbanded early in 1986. The band's {{status as an}} icon on the Australian music scene was acknowledged by induction into the 1996 Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame. Founding guitarist Brad Robinson was unable to attend the Hall of Fame induction in person, as he was hospitalised with lymphoma and died two weeks later.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, {{the band}} {{released}} {{the best of}} their early material as a compilation titled Crawl File, which peaked at numbertwo on the albums charts. Geffen released Semantics, internationally, as a long play album with six newly re-recorded tracks compiled from their first three studio albums. Promotion of the album and the subsequent tour was stalled when Guy McDonough died in June of viral pneumonia. Before Guy's death, he had recorded demos with his brother Bill McDonough, and ex-members of their earlier band, The Flatheads. Bill McDonough assembled the tapes and produced Guy McDonough's posthumous album My Place on Wheatley Records in April 1985. Tracks from these sessions were re-mastered and released on Lost & Found in 1996, credited under the 'Members of Australian Crawl' name. Meanwhile, remaining Australian Crawl members had recorded their fourth studio album, Between <b>a</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hard</b> Place, which was released in 1985 and achieved number11 on the albums charts. This was followed by the announcement that they would disband after another tour. The live album, The Final Wave recorded their performance on 27 January 1986; it was released in October and peaked at number16 on the albums charts.|$|E

Adapted from Ralston's autobiography Between <b>a</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hard</b> Place, 127 Hourss screenplay was written by Boyle and Simon Beaufoy.

500|$|By 1985 {{the group}} {{recorded}} their last studio album, Between <b>a</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hard</b> Place, with English producer Adam Kidron. It {{was released in}} Australia on Australian Crawl's own label Freestyle Records. [...] The album, which allegedly cost $400,000 to record, was a mishmash of styles and a commercial disaster (it peaked at No. 12 in August 1985 but {{slipped out of the}} Top 40 two weeks later). None of the singles had any Top 40 chart success. Harry Brus (Kevin Borich Express) replaced long-standing bass player Paul Williams in May 1985. The band performed three songs for the July 1985 Oz for Africa concert—part of the global Live Aid program—"Reckless (Don't Be So)", [...] "Two Can Play" [...] and [...] "The Boys Light Up". It was broadcast in Australia (on both Seven Network and Nine Network) and on MTV in the US.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{described}} as [...] "uneven" [...] and an [...] "inauspicious start to the second season" [...] by James Van Hise and Hal Schuster in their book The Complete Trek: The Next Generation. While the duo praised the addition of Muldaur and Goldberg, {{the lack of a}} follow-up to the episode was criticised as they felt that the events should have had some type of lasting effect on Troi. It was suggested that either she would want to have a child, or she would be wary of them in general due to the impact of the loss of Ian. Keith DeCandido pointed out several changes at the start of this season in [...] "The Child" [...] that would recur {{throughout the rest of the}} run of The Next Generation in his review for Tor.com. These included moving Geordi La Forge to become chief engineer, placing Miles O'Brien as transporter chief and Riker growing a beard. However, he criticised the fact that Worf's calling for Troi to have an abortion was never mentioned again, but added that it was discussed in a non-canon novel, <b>A</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hard</b> Place by Peter David.|$|E

2500|$|Simon Cyril Hussey (born 7 July 1960, Lismore) is an Australian multi-instrumentalist, songwriter-arranger, record {{producer}} and audio engineer. In 1984 he formed Cats Under Pressure on keyboards with Mark Greig on guitar and David Reyne (ex-Australian Crawl) on drums and vocals. Hussey and Greig joined Australian Crawl's demo and recording sessions for their fourth studio album, Between <b>a</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hard</b> Place (August 1985). Hussey provided keyboards and co-wrote material with the band's lead singer, James Reyne (David's older brother). In 1987 when James undertook his solo career, Hussey joined his backing band on keyboards, and co-wrote six tracks for James' debut self-titled album including top10 hit singles, [...] "Hammerhead" [...] (October) and [...] "Motor's Too Fast" [...] (June 1988). In May 1988 Hussey was the producer, and provided keyboards and song writing, for Edge (November), the comeback album by Daryl Braithwaite (ex-Sherbet), which peaked at No.1 on the ARIA Albums Chart {{for three weeks}} in mid-1989.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 October Asquith {{wrote to}} Law {{suggesting}} an informal {{meeting of the}} two party leaders, which Law accepted. The two met at Cherkley Court, the home of Law's ally Sir Max Aitken MP (later Lord Beaverbrook), on 14 October. The meeting lasted an hour, and Law told Asquith that {{he would continue to}} try to have Parliament dissolved, and that in any ensuing election the Unionists would accept the result even if it went against them. Law later expressed his fear to Lansdowne that Asquith would persuade the Irish Nationalists to accept Home Rule with the exclusion of four Ulster counties. Carson would not accept this, requiring all six counties to be excluded, and such a move might split the Unionists. Law knew that Asquith was unlikely to consent to a general election, since he would almost certainly lose it, and that any attempt to pass the Home Rule Bill [...] "without reference to the electorate" [...] would lead to civil disturbance. As such, Asquith was stuck [...] "between <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> place" [...] and was sure to negotiate.|$|E
