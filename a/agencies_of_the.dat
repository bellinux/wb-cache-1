5|$|In {{the weeks}} after the storm, the hardest hit {{residents}} faced food shortages and lacked access to clean water, in an area already facing ongoing food shortages. In response, the World Food Programme and other <b>agencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Nations created a program to feed about 350,000people in the region over three months, providing about 5,900tons of food. In the months after the storm, roads were repaired, including the link from Vangaindrano to Midongy. Farmers grew additional beans and potatoes {{to compensate for the}} damaged crops, while the quick distribution of food prevented significant malnutrition.

5|$|The Port of New York and New Jersey {{comprised}} {{the main point}} of embarkation for U.S. troops and supplies sent to Europe during World War I, via the New York Port of Embarkation.

The solution was the 1921 creation of the Port Authority {{under the supervision of the}} governors of the two states. By issuing its own bonds, it was financially independent of either state; the bonds were paid off from tolls and fees, not from taxes. It became one of the major <b>agencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metropolitan area for large-scale projects.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{leadership}} {{expected to}} reach these targets with economic aid from the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) and loans from international <b>agencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capitalist world. The 4th National Congress {{made it clear that}} agriculture would be socialised; however, during the Second Five-Year Plan the socialisation measures went so badly that Võ Chí Công, a Politburo member and Chairman of the Committee for the Socialist Transformation of Agriculture, claimed {{it would be impossible to}} meet the targets set by the plan by 1980. An estimated 10,000 out of 13,246 socialist cooperatives, established during the plan, had collapsed in the South by 1980. Politburo member Lê Thanh Nghị attacked lower-level cadres for the failure of the socialist agriculture transformation. The collectivisation process led to an abrupt drop in food production in 1977 and 1978, leading the 6th Plenum of the Central Committee to completely overhaul the Party's agricultural policies.|$|E

5|$|Most {{of these}} events were {{organized}} by <b>agencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mexican and Central American governments, and their respective tourism industries expected to attract thousands of visitors. Mexico is visited by about 22 million foreigners in a typical year. However, in 2012, the national tourism agency expected to attract 52 million visitors just to the regions of Chiapas, Yucatán, Quintana Roo, Tabasco and Campeche. A Maya activist group in Guatemala, Oxlaljuj Ajpop, objected to the commercialization of the date. A spokesman from the Conference of Maya Ministers commented that for them the Tikal ceremony is not a show for tourists but something spiritual and personal. The secretary of the Great Council of Ancestral Authorities commented that living Maya felt they {{were excluded from the}} activities in Tikal. This group held a parallel ceremony, and complained that the date has been used for commercial gain. In addition, before the main Tikal ceremony, about 200 Maya protested the celebration because they felt excluded. Most modern Maya were indifferent to the ceremonies, and the small number of people still practising ancient rites held solemn, more private ceremonies.|$|E
