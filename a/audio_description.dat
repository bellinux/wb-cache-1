25|$|BBC Two {{originally}} showed children's {{programming in}} the morning, with two different blocks: CBBC and CBeebies. First, at 6am until 7am the CBeebies block was shown (every day), then at 7am until 8:30am CBBC was shown (weekdays only), then at 8:30am to 11:30am {{it was followed}} by BBC World News, with Daily Politics on Wednesday. The CBeebies block was then shown again (only on weekdays). On BBC Two Scotland between 8.30 and 9am, they would show Gaelic children's programmes under the name CBeebies Alba. Then at 9am they would hand over to CBeebies. On Saturdays, the CBBC block was shown from 7am until 12pm (at 11:40am a repeat of MOTD Kickabout would be shown.) On Sundays, the CBBC block was shown from 7am until 10am (except if special events were shown). But in 2013 this was removed as the digital switchover meant that the dedicated CBBC and Cbeebies channel were widely available, and replaced by repeats and the Signzone (programmes from across the BBC with sign language, <b>audio</b> <b>description</b> etc.). At the same time a new hour-long news programme was created at 11am called Eleven O'Clock Newshour which is made up of half an hour of BBC News and half BBC World News. Other News Channel programmes such as HARDtalk and Click were added to fill the 10:30am slot. From 2014 the first UK airing of BBC World News's The Travel Show fills the Friday morning slot.|$|E

Once in a “normalized ” format, descriptions can be then projected into uniform and semantically relevant vector spaces, ready to be processed {{by a variety of}} well known computational intelligence techniques. As higher semantic results are then available, these can be exported as interoperable (RDF) annotations about the resource that was originally fed into the system. As novel aspect, through the use and interchange of MPEG- 7 descriptions, the framework allows building applications (e. g. classificators) which can provide annotations on distributed audio resource sets. 1...|$|R
