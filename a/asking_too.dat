5|$|Revie {{was offered}} a five-year £100,000 {{contract}} (plus £50,000 signing-on fee) by Everton in the summer, but remained with Leeds after the move broke down due to a new law introduced in Parliament that prevented wage rises to curb inflation. He chose to continue with largely the same line-up for the 1973–74 season. He told his squad that the aim for the season would be to go unbeaten throughout the campaign. Though Leeds failed to achieve this as they lost three successive games in February/March, they did secure the title with a five-point lead over Liverpool. Completely focused on the league, and finally accepting that he was <b>asking</b> <b>too</b> much of his players to try and win every competition he played weakened teams to allow an early exit from the UEFA Cup. He chose {{to take the job}} of England national football team manager ahead of leading a European Cup challenge at Leeds and breaking up the ageing team he had stuck with for many years, and though he was well loved at the club he was not popular with the Leeds boardroom members, who appointed Brian Clough, a fierce critic of Revie as his successor. Despite lasting just 44 days in the job, Clough spent more in transfer fees than Revie had in his 13 years at the club.|$|E

He {{wrote the}} book to {{challenge}} the [...] "Educational romanticism which <b>asks</b> <b>too</b> much from students {{at the bottom of}} the intellectual pile, asks the wrong things from those in the middle, and <b>asks</b> <b>too</b> little from those at the top." ...|$|R

25|$|Another {{important}} {{investigative tool}} at the player's disposal is the Voight-Kampff machine, which tests people {{to determine if}} they are replicants. Usually, Voight-Kampff tests are automatically triggered at certain predetermined points in the game, although on occasion, the player has the option of administering a test. The test depicts a close-up of the subject's eye, and features three needles. The further the top needle moves to the right, the more likely the subject is a replicant; the further the bottom needle moves to the right, {{the more likely they are}} human. The third needle is on a sweeping axis and measures the intensity of the questions (for every question the player can choose low, medium or high intensity), and the pressure felt by the subject. If the player pushes the subject too far, by <b>asking</b> <b>too</b> many high intensity questions, the test will end before a definite result can be obtained. If the player determines with certainty whether a subject is or is not a replicant, the test ends automatically. The player must then decide what course of action to take, with the decision influencing the rest of the storyline; for example, if a subject tests positive as a replicant, the player can kill them, attempt to arrest them, or let them go.|$|E

Her first record for Mercury, a version of Fats Waller's [...] "Ain't Misbehavin'", was another hit, {{starting}} {{a long string of}} success. Between 1948 and 1955, she had 27 R top ten hits, making her {{one of the most popular}} and successful singers of the period. Both [...] "Am I <b>Asking</b> <b>Too</b> Much" [...] (1948) and [...] "Baby Get Lost" [...] (1949) reached Number 1 on the R chart, and her version of [...] "I Wanna Be Loved" [...] (1950) crossed over to reach Number 22 on the US pop chart.

2500|$|Southam's school {{proved to}} be stiffer {{competition}} than its predecessors. In 1856, both schools heeded a suggestion made by James Kay, the doctor and educationist, to approach Owens College {{with a view to}} a merger. E. M. Brockbank, a medical historian, says that [...] " [...] propositions apparently rather amazed the College people as being too one-sided- the schools giving too little and <b>asking</b> <b>too</b> much ...There were in the proposals, [...] said, a request for space, for power of administration, and for {{a large portion of the}} income of the College." [...] Thus the idea was abandoned and, later in the same year, the two medical schools amalgamated. The teaching then took place at Chatham Street until 1861 while improvements were made to the Pine Street premises. Those improvements included construction of a more imposing frontage on the Faulkner Street elevation; when the Chatham Street premises were sold and teaching transferred back to Pine Street, the school address was advertised as [...] "Faulkner Street behind the Infirmary" [...] and it became colloquially known as the Faulkner Street school from then onwards.|$|E
