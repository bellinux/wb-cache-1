40|$|This paper aims to {{shed light}} on the {{economic}} tools, as well as the legal-economic reasoning, which are used by different European antitrust authorities to assess the allegedly anticompetitive practices of a platform operating in a two-sided market (2 SM). First of all, we show that despite the flourishing literature on 2 SM economics, antitrust authorities are still facing major challenges when taking decisions concerning two-sided platforms (2 SPs). We suggest that in the lack of a sound economic theory on the effects of abusive behaviour in 2 SMs, antitrust authorities have a discretionary power as to what to retain or ignore of a 2 SP 2 ̆ 019 s business model. Secondly, we perform a cross-country, comparative analysis of four recent competition proceedings against the 2 SP Booking. com and highlight conceptual and practical divergences among antitrust authorities which are bound by and applying a common European legislation towards the same transnational company.

40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{importance}} of evaluating disability outcome measures is well recognised. The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) {{was developed to}} be a more comprehensive and "sensitive" measure of disability than the Barthel Index (BI). Although the FIM is widely used and {{has been shown to be}} reliable and valid, there is limited information about its responsiveness, particularly in comparison with the BI. This study compares the appropriateness and responsiveness of these two disability measures in patients with multiple sclerosis and stroke.  METHODS—Patients with multiple sclerosis (n= 201) and poststroke (n= 82) patients undergoing inpatient neurorehabilitation were studied. Admission and discharge scores were generated for the BI and the three scales of the FIM (total, motor, and cognitive). <b>Appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> to the study samples was determined by examining score distributions, floor and ceiling effects. Responsiveness was determined using an effect size calculation.  RESULTS—The BI, FIM total, and FIM motor scales show good variability and have small floor and ceiling effects in the study samples. The FIM cognitive scale showed a notable ceiling effect in patients with multiple sclerosis. Comparable effect sizes were found for the BI, and two FIM scales (total and motor) in both patients with multiple sclerosis and stroke patients.  CONCLUSION—All measures were appropriate to the study sample. The FIM cognitive scale, however, has limited usefulness as an outcome measure in progressive multiple sclerosis. The BI, FIM total, and FIM motor scales show similar responsiveness, suggesting that both the FIM total and FIM motor scales have no advantage over the BI in evaluating change. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Knee {{replacement}} surgery reduces {{pain for}} many people with osteoarthritis (OA). However, surgical outcomes are partly dependent on patients’ moods, and those with depression or anxiety have worse outcomes. Approximately one-third of people with OA have mood problems. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), a psychological therapy, is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for improving mood. However, evidence for the effectiveness of CBT before knee surgery in improving pain, mood, {{and quality of life}} following this surgery for people with knee OA is lacking. Methods/Design: This is a multi-centre, mixed-methods feasibility randomised controlled trial to compare treatment as usual (TAU) plus a brief CBT-based intervention with a TAU-only control, for people with knee OA. We will recruit 50 patients with knee OA, listed for knee replacement surgery, with high levels of distress (assessed using a mood questionnaire), and who consent to take part. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive TAU plus intervention or TAU. Up to 10 sessions of CBT will be offered on an individual basis by a psychologist. The assessments and interventions will be completed before surgery. Repeat assessments at 4 and 6 months after randomisation will be sent and received by post. Two patient-partners will conduct feedback interviews with some participants to assess what aspects of the intervention were helpful or unhelpful, the acceptability of randomisation, the experience of being in a control group, and the <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> used. Interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed using the framework approach. We will examine the feasibility and acceptability of patient-partners conducting the interviews by also interviewing the patient-partners. Discussion: Findings from this study will be used to design a definitive study that will examine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the CBT intervention in improving patient outcomes following knee surgery...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to inform the {{development}} of screening tools for identifying dyslexia in the Persian language. Measures based on those used in English tests were investigated to assess their relevance for Persian-based assessments. Five studies were conducted. In the first, 140 Persian speaking pupils from five different grades were tested to determine the <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> for use across these grades. In the second study, 64 students were examined with more complex test items to reduce ceiling effects in the data. Overall, the results of these studies suggested a high level of accuracy in text reading in early stages of Persian literacy development. Three further studies then contrasted Persian and English, and dyslexic and non-dyslexic, children. Study 3, in which 40 Persian and 50 English pupils in the third and forth year of schooling were tested, revealed consistency in phonological processing predictors of literacy levels across cohorts. Study 4 compared 36 dyslexic and 58 non-dyslexic grade 1 and 2 Persian children and identified deficits among dyslexic children in literacy and phonological processing. Similar conclusions were derived in study 5, which contrasted differences in performance of year 3 English dyslexics (N= 23) and non-dyslexics (N= 25) with those found with grade 2 Persian dyslexics (N= 16) and non-dyslexics (N= 30). These results could be argued to be confirmatory of theories of dyslexia that propose a universal (cross-language) phonological deficit as the primary cause of dyslexia amongst children. However, the studies reported in this thesis also indicated that the Persian learners reached higher levels of accuracy earlier than their English counterparts, a finding more consistent with script-dependent viewpoints. The data are discussed in terms of these underlying causes and the implications for practice (assessment and intervention) are considered for this relatively under-studied language...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades more {{attention}} has been paid by the governments of developed and developing countries to the role of higher education in general and universities in particular. Their major concern is the growing demand for higher education and the growing expenditure of that sector. These two reasons led to an inquiry into the role of higher education institutions, their objectives and their effective use of the resources allocated to them. The need to achieve better understanding and definition of the role of higher education institutions and effectiveness requires better understanding of the institutional objectives and their measure of achievement by the various constituencies involved in the institutions' activities. This study aimed to investigate the different objectives and to examine the appropriateness and degree of achievement of measures of a set of institutional goals in four Arab Universities. The study approach used included a literature survey of studies conducted on higher education institutions in Europe, North America and the Arab States and the collection of data by a questionnaire. The population sample represents administrators and faculty members in the four Arab Universities. Mean scores were used to generate the ranking of the objective areas, in terms of their perceived preferences among the four universities and among the respondent groups. Also, the analysis of variance technique was used to ascertain which of the objective areas and their measures received divergent views among the four universities and among the respondent groups. The analysis of variance technique was followed by Duncan's New Multiple Comparison test to identify pairs of factors which differ significantly, to help in the interpretation of the findings. The study revealed that there were differences in respondent ratings of the objective areas, their measures and degree of achievement among the four universities but not among the different respondents categories. The findings of the study provided the conclusion that: only in some objective areas were priorities perceived differently by the universities and by respondent groups; homogeneity exists among the respondent groups on the <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> and the degree of achievement of these measures; close correlation appears to exist between the ratings of the objective areas and their associated measures; and, finally, there was consensus among the respondents that all universities were performing poorly on the most highly rated objective areas.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{three separate}} studies examining <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> an individual's emotional {{response to their}} sexual initiation and their current feelings of sexual guilt. First, a systematic review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature is presented. From this review it was shown that previous {{research has found that}} an individual's response to his/her FSI experience has the potential to lead to later negative mental, physical and sexual health outcomes. However, limitations existed among and between studies. It was determined that a new measure of FSI emotional response was needed to minimize <b>the</b> limitations <b>of</b> previous <b>measures</b> which can be used consistently in future research. Criteria for such a measure are discussed. Second a new measure of an individual emotional response to his/her sexual initiation experience was constructed using <b>the</b> conclusions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature. <b>The</b> validity <b>of</b> this <b>measure</b> was examined among a mixed gender sample of participants, asking participants to rate emotions currently and at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event, using more sophisticated statistical analyses than previous research. Results provided evidence for <b>the</b> <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> as well as support for utilizing both time periods of questioning. It was found that individuals were able to make a distinction between these two time periods, providing separate and distinct factor structures. Implications of these results are discussed. Finally, utilizing <b>the</b> newly constructed <b>measure,</b> a structural equation model was created {{to examine the relationship between}} FSI emotional response and current sexual guilt. An individual's emotional response to his/her sexual initiation experience was found to be associated with his/her current degree of sexual guilt. Despite previous research suggesting <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual's age at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sexual initiation event, it was found in the current study that this FSI emotional response was more strongly related to sexual guilt than age at FSI.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} <b>the</b> administration <b>of</b> Native affairs by the Liberal Government from 1893 to 1906. In 1893, {{just two}} years after the Liberals came to power the Native Department was dismantled, with the Justice Department forced to take over <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> its work. However, as this thesis argues, such attempts to administer Native affairs without a single, focussed agency failed. Accordingly the department was re-established in 1906. This thesis begins by discussing how the newly-elected Liberal Government set about abolishing the Native Department in 1893, and describes <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> department's functions to a range of other state agencies. <b>The</b> dismantling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> department was seen as <b>the</b> logical result <b>of</b> several decades of attempts made by other Ministries to wind down the department. However, the decision to abolish the Native Department was taken by the Liberals against a background of sharply divided opinion, among both Māori and Europeans, as to <b>the</b> <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure.</b> For a period of thirteen years Maori were denied <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> a specialist Government agency working in their interests. The thesis describes how other agencies managed Native affairs, and especially points to the problems that arose following <b>the</b> fragmenting <b>of</b> Native affairs administration. This was especially evident after James Carroll became Native Minister in 1899. Soon after his appointment, a Māori Land Administration Department was established, whose purpose was to service in a limited way the new Māori land administration councils. However, in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> increasing activity in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> land administration, and in <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perceived failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> councils, and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Māori Land Administration Department, <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Native Affairs was re-established in 1906.

40|$|Background A new {{caregiver}} burden questionnaire for heart failure (CBQ-HF v 1. 0) was developed based on previously conducted qualitative interviews with HF caregivers and with input from HF clinical experts. Version 1. 0 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CBQ-HF included 41 items <b>measuring</b> <b>the</b> burden associated with caregiving {{in the following}} domains: physical, emotional/psychological, social, and impact on caregiver’s life. Following initial development, the next stage was to evaluate caregivers’ understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> questionnaire items and their conceptual relevance. Methods To evaluate the face and content validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new questionnaire, cognitive {{interviews were conducted with}} caregivers of heart failure patients. The cognitive interviews included a “think aloud” exercise as the patient completed the CBQ-HF, followed by more specific probing questions to better understand caregivers’ understanding, interpretation and <b>the</b> relevance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instructions, items, response scales and recall period. Results Eighteen caregivers of heart failure patients were recruited. <b>The</b> mean age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> caregivers was 50  years (SD[*]=[*] 10. 2). Eighty-three percent of caregivers were female and most commonly the patient was either a spouse (44 %) or a parent (28 %). Among the patients 55 % were NYHA Class 2 and 45 % were NYHA Class 3 or 4. The caregiver cognitive interviews demonstrated that the CBQ-HF was well understood, relevant and consistently interpreted. From the initial 41 item questionnaire, fifteen items were deleted due to conceptual overlap and/or item redundancy. The final 26 -item CBQ-HF (v 3. 0) uses a 5 -point Likert severity scale, assessing 4 domains of physical, emotional/psychological, social and lifestyle burdens using a 4 -week recall period. Conclusions The CBQ-HF (v 3. 0) is a comprehensive and relevant measure of subjective {{caregiver burden}} with strong content validity. This study has established that the CBQ-HF (v 3. 0) has strong face and content validity and should be valuable as an outcomes measure to help understand and monitor the relationship between patient heart failure severity and caregiver burden.

40|$|The {{evidence}} {{presented in this}} study suggests that the dispersion, accuracy and transitory component in revisions of financial analysts' forecasts (FAF) are determined by production/investment/financing decisions, accounting choices as well as firm specific characteristics including <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> control, debt to equity ratio and size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firm. Firms with managers control (owners control), high (low) debt to equity ratio and large (small) size are hypothesized to have higher (lower) dispersion, forecast error and transitory components in revisions of FAF. These hypotheses are motivated by the contracting cost and political visibility theories. The information availability theory is included as a contrast to the political visibility hypothesis. The information availability hypothesis predicts large (small) firms to have lower (higher) dispersion, forecast error and transitory component in revisions <b>of</b> FAF. <b>The</b> regression results are sensitive to deflated and undeflated <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dispersion and accuracy of FAF and size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firm. <b>The</b> <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> firm's size, <b>the</b> book value <b>of</b> total assets and <b>the</b> market value <b>of</b> common stock plus long-term debt, as well as the deflated and undeflated measures of dispersion and accuracy of FAF are investigated.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} musculoskeletal disorder. Conventional treatment (i. e., <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-NSAIDs) is associated with well-documented adverse effects. Devil's Claw (Harpagophytum procumbens) a traditional South African herbal remedy used for rheumatic conditions, may be a safer treatment option. To date, 14 clinical trials have assessed its efficacy/ effectiveness in OA. AIM: To address the two main questions of importance to clinicians: (1) Does Devil's Claw work for <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> OA, and (2) Is it safe? METHODS: A review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature on Devil's Claw and OA from 1966 to 2006 was performed using multiple search databases, monographs, and citation tracking. Relevant trials in all languages were identified and included. Both internal validity (i. e., adequacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dosage and period of treatment for this condition, reporting of randomization, rates of dropout, blinding, and statistical analysis) and external validity (i. e., inclusion/ exclusion criteria, baseline characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study populations, trial setting, and <b>the</b> <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outcome <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trials) were assessed. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were identified: eight observational studies; 2 comparator trials (1 open, the other randomized to assess clinical effectiveness); and 4 double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trials to assess efficacy. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> published trials lacked certain important methodological quality criteria. However, {{the data from the}} higher quality studies suggest that Devil's Claw appeared effective in <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main clinical symptom <b>of</b> pain. <b>The</b> assessment <b>of</b> safety is limited by the small populations generally evaluated in the clinical studies. From the current data, Devil's Claw appears to be associated with minor risk (relative to NSAIDs), but further long-term assessment is required. CONCLUSIONS: <b>The</b> methodological quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing clinical trials is generally poor, and although they provide some support, there are a considerable number of methodologic caveats that make further clinical investigations warranted. The clinical evidence to date cannot provide a definitive answer to the two questions posed: (1) Does it work? And (2) is it safe? A definitive high-quality trial that addresses the necessary methodologic improvements noted is needed to answer these important clinical questions...|$|R

Conventional approaches and a set of newly developed methods are applied to seven isozyme loci in four beech stands which are distinguished by different types of forest management based on natural regeneration. Results Permutation analyses show that correlations between spatial distances and genetic differences vary only little in the studied beech stands. In view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> popularity <b>of</b> this and related descriptors of spatiogenetic covariation, this result came as a surprise. The newly developed methods lead to a different conclusion. Significant spatiogenetic structure is indicated in all stands when considering the mean and variance of spatiogenetic separation, where separation is <b>measured</b> by <b>the</b> smallest spatiogenetic difference of an individual from all others. Spatiogenetic difference is measured here by a combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spatial distances and genetic differences between individuals. This descriptor indicates <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> spatiogenetic clusters in the beech stands. In order to arrive at an explicit representation of cluster structure as a representation of subpopulation structure, two types of cluster structure (primary and α -isolated) are distinguished, both of which reflect desirable characteristics of subpopulation structure. Particularly in the α -isolated structure, <b>the</b> proportion <b>of</b> individuals organized in clusters, the effective size, and <b>the</b> effective number <b>of</b> clusters clearly distinguish and consistently rank the four stands with respect to their types of forest management and <b>the</b> associated criteria <b>of</b> autochthony. Conclusion <b>The</b> surprisingly high correspondence between our descriptors of spatiogenetic structure and forest management types confirms <b>the</b> <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> applied <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> cluster isolation and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> criterion for <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> level α <b>of</b> cluster isolation. <b>The</b> two types <b>of</b> cluster structure and their characteristic descriptors are thus suggested to be promising tools for <b>the</b> detection <b>of</b> subpopulation structure. To include <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> long-distance gene flow, the presented methods can be extended as outlined to larger spatial scales in order to detect higher order population structure. </p...|$|R
40|$|The final thesis {{analyzes}} {{funding of}} Czech healthcare system in 2015 and shows its sustainability {{in future years}} in order to answer the question, what is <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abolition <b>of</b> regulatory fees, which were introduced in 2008, subsequently in 2014 and cancelled in 2015. Many demographic changes, specifically age structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation, occurred over recent decades in the Czech Republic. This fact caused disproportionate changes on the expenditure side and <b>the</b> revenue side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> health system. The state tried to balance this disparity with short-introduced charges, but those were abolished due to the political pressure. The final thesis assesses <b>the</b> <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> this <b>measure.</b> <b>The</b> theoretical part explains the healthcare system in the Czech Republic and all its entities, explains different approaches to <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> health and issues <b>of</b> regulatory charges. <b>The</b> practical part is devoted to analysis of statistical data. There is <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> health care through <b>the</b> last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statistics and demographic prognosis described. Following part talks about <b>the</b> issues <b>of</b> charges in a broader context of health care. There are also global trends and the biggest problems that the Czech Republic faces in that direction defined. The conclusion evaluates the role and effectiveness of regulatory charges and <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> their abolition, offers possible solutions or recommendations, which are formulated on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> evaluated data. <b>The</b> final thesis concludes that regulatory charges are suitable complement to the overall reform, but this arrangement is not capable of comprehensively addressing current and possible future problems by itself...|$|R
40|$|Nosotros realizamos un estudio {{transversal}} en 193 madres de niños de 6 a 18 meses de edad de una comunidad afro-colombiana con los objetivos: (1) adaptar y validar la escala de hambre del Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project, de apoyo social de DUKE-UNC- 11, y de apoyo del compañero del Québec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD), e (2) identificar la relación entre la inseguridad alimentaria y el soporte social con el estado nutricional infantil. Se midió la validez de constructo mediante análisis factoriales y correlaciones no-paramétricas {{basadas en}} modelos teóricos. Se establecieron los resultado-Z de talla-para-edad y peso-para-talla. El análisis factorial redujo la escala de hambre y la escala de QLSCD a un factor; y la escala de DUKE-UNC- 11 a dos factores. El alfa de Cronbach osciló entre 0, 70 y 0, 90. Las tres escalas se correlacionaron con las condiciones sociales. Las escalas de apoyo se correlacionaron con las redes sociales y la salud percibida de la madre. La inseguridad alimentaria y el apoyo social negativo (emocional y del compañero) se asociaron a menores índices talla-para-edad, y mayor proporción de desnutrición crónica. El estudio apoya la utilidad de los instrumentos presentados en la medición de los conceptos planteados. We conducted a cross-sectional study on 193 mothers of children 6 to 18 {{months of age}} in an African-Colombian community, with the objectives: (1) to adapt and validate the Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project scale, the DUKE-UNC- 11 social support scale, and the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD) partner support scale, and (2) to identify any existent relationship between nutritional status in infancy and both food insecurity and social support. We determined construct validity using factor analysis and theoretical models-based non-parametric correlations. Length-for-age and weight-for-length Z-results were calculated. Factor analyses reduced the hunger scale to one factor, the DUKE-UNC- 11 scale to two factors, and the QLSCD scale to one factor. The Cronbach's alpha test ranged between 0. 70 and 0. 90. Both food insecurity and social support scales were correlated with mother's social conditions, and social support was positively associated with social networks and mother's self-perceived health status. Food insecurity, emotional-social support, and partner's negative support were associated with lower height-to-age and therefore a higher ratio <b>of</b> chronic malnutrition. <b>The</b> study supports <b>the</b> <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instruments to <b>measure</b> <b>the</b> expressed concepts...|$|R
