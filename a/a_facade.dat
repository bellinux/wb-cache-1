5|$|It is {{possible}} that there was <b>a</b> <b>facade</b> {{in front of the}} chamber, as is evident at other chambered tombs in Britain, such as West Kennet Long Barrow and Wayland's Smithy. It is also possible that there was a portal stone atop the chamber, as was apparent at Kit's Coty House and Lower Kit's Coty House. Many of the larger slabs of stone that have fallen down the slope on the eastern end of the monument may have been parts of this facade or portal.|$|E
5|$|Phelan {{reacts to}} McNulty's report by {{complaining}} to senior Police Department figures, embarrassing them into creating a detail dedicated to investigating Barksdale. However, {{owing to the}} department's dysfunction, the investigation is intended as <b>a</b> <b>façade</b> to appease the judge. An intradepartmental struggle between the more motivated officers on the detail and their superiors spans the whole season, with interference by the higher-ups often threatening to ruin the investigation. The detail's commander, Cedric Daniels, acts as mediator between the two opposing groups of police.|$|E
5|$|The mosque {{is located}} on north Muizz Street. It is notable for its façade, which is elaborately {{decorated}} with inscriptions and geometric carving. It is both the first mosque in Cairo to have such decoration, and also the first to have <b>a</b> <b>façade</b> which follows {{the line of the}} street, built at an angle to the rectangular hypostyle hall whose orientation is dictated by the qibla direction.|$|E

5|$|Skylark {{spends the}} day with Kim by playing basketball, hanging out and partying. Kim persuades Skylark that he is {{misunderstood}} as a cruel dictator and as a failed administrator, and they become friends. At dinner, Koh has a seizure due to the ricin poisoning and accidentally kills Yu before dying. The next morning, Skylark feels guilty and discards one of the ricin strips, then thwarts Rapaport's attempt to poison Kim with the second strip. After another dinner mourning the death of Kim's bodyguards, Skylark witnesses Kim's malicious side as he threatens war with South Korea. Skylark leaves, and after taking a walk, he discovers that a nearby grocery store is merely <b>a</b> <b>façade</b> and realizes that Kim has been lying to him.|$|E
5|$|Six {{versions}} of the 8-foot high vault were built, each with specific uses. One of the vaults was <b>a</b> <b>façade</b> built onto {{the front of a}} semitruck and was used for filming close shots of the vault destroying street cars. Another vault was a reinforced, four-wheel self-drive vehicle that was connected to 30-foot cables and dragged through the streets of San Juan by the two stunt Dodge Chargers. The four-ton vault was driven by stunt driver Henry Kingi, who had to wear a temperature controlled suit to compensate for the temperatures within that could exceed 100 degrees. A scene where the vault tumbled as the cars rounded a corner was a practical effect, and the result was more violent than the filmmakers had anticipated. Over 200 vehicles were destroyed by the vault during filming. Several stunts had to be cut including a final scene that would have seen the vault hanging {{over the edge of the}} Teodoro Moscoso Bridge. This stunt was abandoned when it was determined that even the powerful Chargers would not be able to support the vault's weight.|$|E
5|$|U.S. diplomats were {{concerned}} that the move {{would be seen as}} a power grab, as Diệm was organising and driving an electoral process in which he was a candidate. The Americans felt that a legislature should be formed first and that the body should oversee the referendum, but Diệm ignored their advice. Ambassador G. Frederick Reinhardt informed Washington that Diệm had no intention of allowing a level playing field for the opposition, and that the foreign press had already made much of Diệm's democratic pronouncements being <b>a</b> <b>facade.</b> The Department of State agreed and opted to avoid trumpeting the referendum as an exercise in democracy for fear of attracting negative reactions to their foreign policy. Nevertheless, U.S. officials in Vietnam were pleased with the referendum, as they saw it as an opportunity to strengthen South Vietnam and avoid defeat to the communists, as they saw a republican model as being more robust.|$|E

5|$|The UChicago Arts program joins {{academic}} {{departments and}} {{programs in the}} Division of the Humanities and the College, as well as professional organizations including the Court Theatre, the Oriental Institute, the Smart Museum of Art, the Renaissance Society, University of Chicago Presents, and student arts organizations. The university has an artist-in-residence program and scholars in performance studies, contemporary art criticism, and film history. It has offered a doctorate in music composition since 1933 and in cinema and media studies since 2000, a master {{of fine arts in}} visual arts (early 1970s), and a master of arts in the humanities with a creative writing track (2000). It has bachelor's degree programs in visual arts, music, and art history, and, more recently, cinema and media studies (1996) and theater and performance studies (2002). The College's general education core includes a “dramatic, musical, and visual arts” requirement, inviting students to study the history of the arts, stage desire, or begin working with sculpture. Several thousand major and non-major undergraduates enroll annually in creative and performing arts classes. UChicago is often considered the birthplace of improvisational comedy as the Compass Players student comedy troupe evolved into The Second City improv theater troupe in 1959. The Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts opened in October 2012, five years after a $35 million gift from alumnus David Logan and his wife Reva. The center includes spaces for exhibitions, performances, classes, and media production. The Logan Center was designed by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. This building is actually entirely glass. The brick is <b>a</b> <b>facade</b> designed to keep the glass safe from the wind. The architects later removed sections of the bricks when pressure arose in the form of complaints that the views of the city were blocked.|$|E
5|$|Through his {{involvement}} with the Design and Industries Association Holden met Frank Pick, {{general manager of the}} Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). Holden at the time had no experience in designing for transport, but this would change through his collaboration with Pick. In 1923, Pick commissioned Holden to design <b>a</b> <b>façade</b> for a side entrance at Westminster tube station. This was followed in 1924 with an appointment to design the UERL's pavilion for the British Empire Exhibition. Also in 1924, Pick commissioned Holden to design seven new stations in south London for the extension of the City and South London Railway (now part of the Northern line) from Clapham Common to Morden. The designs replaced a set by the UERL's own architect, Stanley Heaps, which Pick had found unsatisfactory. The designs reflect the simple modernist style he was using in France for the war cemeteries; double-height ticket halls are clad in plain Portland stone framing a glazed screen, each adapted to suit the street corner sites of most of the stations. The screens feature the Underground roundel made up in coloured glass panels and are divided by stone columns surmounted by capitals formed as a three-dimensional version of the roundel. Holden also advised Heaps on new façades for a number of the existing stations on the line and produced the design for a new entrance at Bond Street station on the Central London Railway.|$|E

40|$|Taking {{into account}} Mediterranean climate {{particularities}} for Barcelona, Spain, {{a whole year}} study using TAS simulation software was carried out for <b>a</b> Double Skin <b>Façade</b> corporative office building. It is a typical office building with an extended working hours schedule for acclimatization. Four different cavity widths were simulated – 40 cm, 60 cm, 80 cm, 100 cm- as well as three different external opening areas for cavity’s natural ventilation purpose. Two Double Skin Façade typologies were simulated – <b>a</b> corridor <b>façade</b> and <b>a</b> multistory <b>façade.</b> Simulations showed cooling loads are much greater than heating loads on a double glazed skin façade building south oriented in a Mediterranean climate town like Barcelona. Results demonstrated that <b>a</b> Multistory <b>Façade,</b> depending on its configuration, might save up to 5 % on annual cooling loads respect to <b>a</b> Corridor <b>Façade.</b> Different opening areas and cavity depths shall be used for different typologies in order to obtaining good energy results...|$|R
