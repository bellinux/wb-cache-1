5|$|After an April 21, 1995, {{court hearing}} on the gun charges, but before McVeigh's release, federal agents took him into custody as they {{continued}} their investigation into the bombing. Rather than talk to investigators about the bombing, McVeigh demanded an attorney. Having been tipped off {{by the arrival of}} police <b>and</b> <b>helicopters</b> that a bombing suspect was inside, a restless crowd began to gather outside the jail. While McVeigh's requests for a bulletproof vest or transport by helicopter were denied, authorities did use a helicopter to transport him from Perry to Oklahoma City.|$|E
5|$|After {{the passage}} of the cyclone, the Iran chapter of the Red Cross and its volunteers worked in {{conjunction}} with the military to distribute relief supplies to villages using trucks <b>and</b> <b>helicopters.</b> The branch in Sistan and Baluchestan Province distributed over 10,000blankets, 1,300tents, 400clothing items, 82,000loaves of bread, and 87,000bottles of water to affected citizens. In total, 61,558families received aid from the Red Cross in Iran. The Iranian government provided monetary relief to the affected people. Officials worked to restore roads, bridges, and power systems in the affected areas, although repairs were more difficult in some locations; by a week after the storm, several villages remained surrounded by floodwaters.|$|E

50|$|In response, the Navy {{began to}} widen the mission requirements. This created {{a need for a}} {{specific}} Squadron in support of the mission requirements. In April 1967, HC-1 was divided into four separate units, Helicopter Combat Support Squadron THREE (Navy Vertical Replenishment), <b>and</b> <b>Helicopter</b> Combat Support Squadron FIVE <b>and</b> <b>Helicopter</b> Combat Support Squadron SEVEN (Navy Combat Search <b>and</b> Rescue), <b>and</b> <b>Helicopter</b> Attack Squadron (Light) 3 (HAL-(3)), nicknamed the Seawolves.|$|R
5|$|Officials advised {{residents}} {{near the}} coastline to evacuate to safer areas further inland. Approximately 40,000vacationing in the Outer Banks evacuated; however, roughly 2,500residents decided {{to ride out}} the storm in their homes. In Kitty Hawk and Nags Head, volunteer firefighters traveled door-to-door urging residents to leave. Schools and hotels across the areas were utilized as shelters for tourists. National Parks across the Outer Banks closed {{for the duration of}} the storm. Aircraft at the Marine Corps Camp Lejeune were relocated inland <b>and</b> <b>helicopters</b> were moved to hangars; some helicopters remained available for emergency rescue operations. An estimated 6,200residents evacuated to Red Cross shelters in the state.|$|E
5|$|Offshore, a ship called Southern Isle was wrecked by {{the high}} surf. It had been sailing from Puerto Rico with a full load of iron ore and, as it {{approached}} the hurricane, the vessel changed directions and slowed down. By October 5, winds were strong and the seas were moderately rough. Very quickly, the ship broke into two, which prevented any time to escape on lifeboats. By {{the day after the}} wreck, rescue boats <b>and</b> <b>helicopters</b> found seven people, one of whom later died from their injuries. Ultimately, 17people died in the event.|$|E
5|$|The UN {{extended}} its mandate on 8 February 1996. In March, Savimbi and dos Santos formally agreed {{to form a}} coalition government. The government deported 2,000 West African and Lebanese Angolans in Operation Cancer Two, in August 1996, {{on the grounds that}} dangerous minorities were responsible for the rising crime rate. In 1996 the Angolan government bought military equipment from India, two Mil Mi-24 attack helicopters and three Sukhoi Su-17 from Kazakhstan in December, <b>and</b> <b>helicopters</b> from Slovakia in March.|$|E

5|$|The {{airfield}} {{opened in}} 2005 {{and serves as}} {{the centre of the}} Dronning Maud Land Air Network (DROMLAN), a multinational cooperation to use Troll as an all-year hub to provide intercontinental traffic to Antarctica and onwards to the various research stations using aircraft suitable for inter-Antarctic operations. Intercontinental flights normally operate from Cape Town International Airport using Ilyushin 76, C-130 Hercules, P-3 Orion and similar, long-range aircraft. Feeding services to other research station is normally done either with Basler BT-67 aircraft, De Havilland DHC-6/300 Twin Otter aircraft and Dornier Do-228 aircraft <b>and</b> <b>helicopters.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{battle of}} Bình Giã {{reflected}} the Viet Cong's growing military strength and influence, {{especially in the}} Mekong Delta region. It {{was the first time}} the Viet Cong launched a large-scale operation, holding its ground and fighting for four days against government troops equipped with armor, artillery <b>and</b> <b>helicopters,</b> and aided by U.S. air support and military advisers. The Viet Cong demonstrated that, when well-supplied with military supplies from North Vietnam, they had the ability to fight and inflict damage even on the best ARVN units.|$|E
5|$|With {{the success}} of these projects, IPF has been doing {{revegetation}} projects along the road below the Top Cut since 2004. Compost blankets were applied to large sections of the soil to replace lost nutrients. In 2009 the foundation began removing metal and rebar snow fences embedded in the soil just below the pass summit during the 1960s as part of an abortive project to increase meltwater capture by the Twin Lakes Tunnel. They were an aesthetic blight as well as an environmental problem, and had to be removed using a team of mules <b>and</b> <b>helicopters</b> due to the wilderness area restrictions. The last fence material was removed in 2012.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of {{the storm}} on August25, the United States Department of Defense set the Condition of Readiness (COR) at stage 3 on Guam, {{indicating}} destructive winds were possible within 48hours. A day later, the COR was raised to stage 2; all but two United States Navy ships were sortied from the harbor to prevent damage, and the remainder rode out the storm southwest of Guam. On August28, COR 1 was declared, the highest level. In response, all fixed-wing aircraft <b>and</b> <b>helicopters</b> on the island were moved into hangars or transported to Japan or the Philippines. All schools were closed {{for the duration of}} Omar's passage over Guam. Flight operations were suspended for at least two days, stranding 5,000passengers on the island. About 3,100people rode out the storm in emergency shelters.|$|E
5|$|Although Southern California and Mexico were {{considered}} for the main unit filming, the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i (where Stiller has a home) was selected {{for the majority of}} the shooting. Kaua'i was chosen over Mexico because a tax credit for in-state spending was negotiated with the Kaua'i Film Commission. John Toll, the cinematographer, stated the island was also selected for its similarity to Vietnam, based on its dense foliage, variety of terrains, and weather. Kaua'i was first scouted as a possible location to film Tropic Thunder in 2004. Stiller spent more than 25 hours over 6 weeks exploring the island, using all-terrain vehicles, boats, <b>and</b> <b>helicopters.</b> After the film was greenlit by DreamWorks in 2006, pre-production lasted for six months, most of this time spent on scouting additional locations for filming. Filming for the Los Angeles and interior scenes occurred on sets at Universal Studios in Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, the {{services}} were gradually {{taken over by}} Lufttransport, who used both small aircraft <b>and</b> <b>helicopters.</b> These gradually became more regular and became de facto scheduled services every fortnight. Lufttransport replaced the helicopter service with a two-engine five-seat aircraft in 1989, which cut the cost of transport significantly. In 1993, Widerøe established itself at Svalbard Airport and flew services to Ny-Ålesund, but this only lasted the one season. In 1996, Lufttransport and Kings Bay made an agreement that the airline would fly once per week during the winter and up to five times per week during the summer. The airline would use a Dornier Do 228, which was also used for flights from Longyearbyen to Svea Airport for Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani.|$|E

5|$|Following their {{transfer}} to the Army, the Chinooks were used in similar roles to those they had undertaken in RAAF service. The first operational deployment of the Army Chinooks began in October 1997, when two of the helicopters and three Black Hawks which were in Papua New Guinea {{as part of a}} training exercise were tasked with delivering food supplies to the highlands of the country following a severe drought. The Chinooks were also used to transport fuel supplies for the other ADF aircraft <b>and</b> <b>helicopters</b> involved in this effort. At this time, the deployment of two Chinooks was the largest the Army could undertake as the other helicopters were undergoing maintenance or were needed for training purposes. The Chinooks returned to Australia in March 1998.|$|E
5|$|In March 1987, {{the main}} Libyan air base of Ouadi Doum was {{captured}} by Chadian forces. Although strongly defended by minefields, 5,000 soldiers, tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft, the Libyans' base fell to a smaller Chadian attacking force led by Djamous equipped with trucks mounted with machine guns and antitank weapons. Observers estimated that, in the Chadian victories {{in the first three}} months of 1987, more than 3,000 Libyan soldiers had been killed, captured, or deserted. Large numbers of tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, fixed-wing aircraft, <b>and</b> <b>helicopters</b> were captured or destroyed. In some cases, Libya sent its own aircraft to bomb abandoned Libyan equipment to deny its use to the Chadians. It was reported that, in many cases, Libyan soldiers had been killed while fleeing to avoid battle. At Ouadi Doum, panicked Libyans had suffered high casualties running through their own minefields.|$|E
5|$|Seventy-four of the 273 {{personnel}} from Evans {{were killed in}} the collision, with the majority of these believed to have been asleep or trapped inside the bow section, which sank within minutes. Melbourne deployed her boats, life rafts, and lifebuoys, before carefully manoeuvring alongside the stern section of Evans, where both ships' crews used mooring lines to lash the ships together. Sailors from Melbourne dived from the flight deck into the water to rescue overboard survivors close to the carrier, while the carrier's boats <b>and</b> <b>helicopters</b> collected those farther out. All of the survivors were located within 12 minutes of the collision and rescued before half an hour had passed, although the search continued for fifteen more hours. After Evans stern was evacuated, it was cast off, while the carrier moved away to avoid damage. The stern did not sink, and was later recovered, stripped of parts, and sunk for target practice.|$|E
