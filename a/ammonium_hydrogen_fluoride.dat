40|$|An energy {{decomposition}} analysis method is implemented {{for the analysis}} of both covalent bonds and intermolecular interactions on the basis of single-determinant Hartree–Fock (HF) (restricted closed shell HF, restricted open shell HF, and unrestricted open shell HF) wavefunctions and their density functional theory analogs. For HF methods, the total interaction energy from a supermolecule calculation is decomposed into electrostatic, exchange, repulsion, and polarization terms. Dispersion energy is obtained from second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory and coupled-cluster methods such as CCSD and CCSD(T). Similar to the HF methods, Kohn–Sham density functional interaction energy is decomposed into electrostatic, exchange, repulsion, polarization, and dispersion terms. Tests on various systems show that this algorithm is simple and robust.

40|$|Abstract. As a {{preferred}} technology to enhance oilfield energy production, well stimulation has {{and will continue}} to have an important role in fulfilling the world’s future energy needs. Mud acid is a conventional acid system that reacts with most injurants and removes damages. However, fast reaction rate with minerals will lead to high leak-off velocity, great possibility of secondary and tertiary precipitation, lower effect of corrosion inhibitor in high temperature as well as short efficient operating range. Therefore, new kinds of acid system are required to cope with these problems above. This paper proposed three acid system with the similarity of fluorine ammonium compounds for sandstone acidizing — <b>ammonium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fluoride</b> (AHF), ammonium fluotitanate (AFT), and ammonium fluoroborate system (AFB). Chemical structures, acidity test and solubility tests have proved the feasibility. Then, performance comparisons are conducted to prove the advantages over mud acid system...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In the {{previous}} in vitro study, fluoride-modified, anodized porous titanium was proven to have enhanced its photo-induced hydrophilicity, which induced the hyperactivation of initial cell response. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of the}} present study was to investigate in vivo bone apposition during the early stages of osseointegration in rabbit tibiae. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anodized porous titanium implants (TiU, TiUnite®, Nobel Biocare AB, Göteborg, Sweden) were modified with 0. 175 wt% <b>ammonium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fluoride</b> solution (NH(4) F-HF(2)). Twenty-four hours prior to the experiments, the surface-modified implants were ultraviolet-irradiated (modTiU). Blinded and unpackaged TiU implants were used as controls. Thereafter, the implants were placed in the rabbit tibial metaphyses and histomorphometrically analyzed at 2 and 6 weeks after insertion. RESULTS: ModTiU demonstrated a significantly greater degree of bone-to-metal contact than TiU after 2 and 6 weeks of healing. CONCLUSION: The results proved that the enhanced photo-induced hydrophilicity of the NH(4) F-HF(2) -modified anodized implants promoted bone apposition during the early stages of osseointegration...|$|E
40|$|Hexagonal beta-NaYF 4 was {{synthesized}} as capped bipyramidal microdisks solvothermally from yttria (Y 2 O 3), {{sodium fluoride}} and <b>ammonium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fluoride.</b> The microdisks {{are bound by}} up to eighteen faces; six { 20 (2) over bar 3 } facets on both {{the top and bottom}} of the disk and six radial { 10 (1) over bar 0 } facets around its central band. The overall morphology and particle size can be modified through change of temperature or alcoholic solvent, both of which affect the development of the { 10 (1) over bar 0 } faces. The photoluminescence properties of doped microdisks, such as down-conversion in the case of beta-NaYF 4 :Eu 3 + or up-conversion for beta-NaYF 4 :Yb 3 +/Er 3 +, were investigated in detail. The lifetime and emission of the Eu 3 + and Er 3 + ions appear related to the morphology of the host crystals.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previously, we {{reported}} that anodized porous titanium implants have photocatalytic hydrophilicity. However, this effect {{was not always}} sufficient for the significant improvement of bone apposition. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study}} was to improve the photocatalytic properties of porous titanium implants by the fluoride modification of the anodized titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), and to investigate the initial cell response to it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ideal concentration of <b>ammonium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fluoride</b> (NH(4) F-HF(2)) used in this study was determined by a static water contact angle assay. The ideal concentration of NH(4) F-HF(2) was 0. 175 %, and experimental disks were treated with this concentration. A pluripotent mesenchymal cell line, C 2 C 12, was cultured on the disks in order to investigate cell attachment, morphology, and proliferation. RESULTS: Cell attachment after 30 minutes of culturing was significantly higher for the ultraviolet-irradiated, fluoride-modified anodized TiO(2) (p <. 05), and the simultaneous scanning electron microscope observation showed a rather flattened and extended cell morphology. The proliferation rate after 24 hours was also significantly higher for the fluoride-modified anodized TiO(2).

TSAE technique was carried out very carefully by using a mixed solution of <b>ammonium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fluoride,</b> hydrochloric acid in presence of inhibitor urotropine and cleaning agent OP- 10 (Russia).

The present investigation {{was carried out}} to evaluate the effects of an experimental surface treatment using etchant and primer on bond strength between a resin composite and Ti– 6 Al– 4 V alloy. MethodsDisk-shaped Ti– 6 Al– 4 V alloy was machine milled, the surface was air abraded with alumina, and the alloy was chemically etched with 5 wt% <b>ammonium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fluoride</b> (F-etch) for 30 s. A phosphate primer (MDP-primer) {{was applied to the}} bonding area, and then a resin composite, with or without milled-fiber resin composite (FRC), was veneered on the specimen. Shear bond strengths were determined after thermocycling for 20, 000 cycles. Bond strength data were analyzed by means of ANOVA and a multiple comparison test (α= 0. 05). The surface of Ti– 6 Al– 4 V alloy was observed using a scanning electron microscope before and after the etching procedure. ResultsNo-FRC/F-etch/MDP-primer exhibited the highest bond strength (28. 2 MPa), followed by No-FRC/No-etching/MDP-primer (24. 2 MPa), FRC/F-etch/MDP-primer (19. 9 MPa), FRC/No-etching/MDP-primer (17. 8 MPa), No-FRC/No-etching/No-primer (13. 6 MPa), while FRC/No-etching/No-primer (2. 5 MPa) resulted in the lowest value. Microphotographs showed that numerous micro and nano pits were created on the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V alloy surface modified with F-etch. ConclusionsThe bond strength between Ti– 6 Al– 4 V alloy and the veneering resin composite was the highest when the alloy surface was modified with alumina blasting, fluoride etchant, and phosphate primer successively...|$|E
