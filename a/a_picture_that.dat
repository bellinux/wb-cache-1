[...] DuBose also stated that the band did not need their faces on the cover because they had grown significantly in popularity; however, he originally intended to include their faces.

500|$|Another of Gaudí's {{innovations}} {{in the technical}} realm {{was the use of}} a scale model to calculate structures: for the church of the Colònia Güell, he built a 1:10 scale model with a height of [...] in a shed next to the building. There, he set up a model that had strings with small bags full of birdshot hanging from them. On a drawing board that was attached to the ceiling he drew the floor of the church, and he hung the strings (for the catenaries) with the birdshot (for the weight) from the supporting points of the building—columns, intersection of walls. These weights produced a catenary curve in both the arches and vaults. At that point, he took <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>that,</b> when inverted, showed the structure for columns and arches that Gaudí was looking for. Gaudí then painted over these photographs with gouache or pastel. The outline of the church defined, he recorded every single detail of the building: architectural, stylistic and decorative.|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 975 feet long, {{was released}} on September 6, 1910. [...] The film was distributed by the Motion Picture Distributing and Sales Company. Once the film was released, it was sometimes listed ambiguously for other productions bearing the same name. One ambiguous listing, most likely for the Thanhouser film, {{was made by the}} Crystal Theatre in Hutchinson, Kansas. Known theaters advertising the film, unambiguously, are noted in Indiana and Arizona. A reviewer of The Moving Picture World wrote, [...] " [...] little domestic tragedy which shows how boys are sometimes driven from home and what results from it. ... It is <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>that</b> goes direct to the heart and makes one put himself in the place of all the characters. Perhaps that magic word, mother, {{is the key to the}} whole situation." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror took issue with the depiction of the step father's violent abuse of the young son and found the melodrama to be one [...] "with an ending that appeals to the sympathies".|$|E

500|$|The {{canonical}} {{image of}} Mariano Moreno {{is the one}} from the portrait Mariano Moreno en su mesa de trabajo (...) [...] It {{was done by the}} Chilean artist Pedro Subercaseaux during the centennial of the May Revolution in 1910. The historian Adolfo Carranza asked him to design various allegorical pictures of the event. Carranza belonged to the mainstream line of historians who professed great admiration for Moreno, who he described as follows: [...] "He was the soul of the government of the revolution of May, his nerve, the distinguished statesman of the group managing the ship attacked the absolutism and doubt, anxious to reach the goal of his aspirations and his destiny. Moreno was the compass and that also grabbed the helm, as he was the strongest and the ablest of those who came to direct it". He asked for <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>that</b> was consistent with this image. The portrait depicts him as a friendly man with an open and round face, a wide forehead, and a serene look. Subsequent interpretations, like those of Antonio Estrada, would follow this style, as would portraits of other members of the Junta. However, as this portrait was made a hundred years after the death of the subject, with no known depictions done during his lifetime, it was thus based on the artist's imagination. It was known that Moreno had clearly visible smallpox scars from the age of eight, but not {{to the point where they}} disfigured his face.|$|E

500|$|A {{remake of}} the {{original}} Halloween was released in 2007. This film focuses on the events that led Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) to kill his family. It also identifies Laurie as Michael’s sister early on, which was something not done in the original 1978 film. On Halloween, Michael murders a school bully, his older sister and her boyfriend, {{as well as his}} mother’s boyfriend. Committed to Smith’s Grove Sanitarium, Michael closes himself off from everyone. Seventeen years later, Michael (Tyler Mane) escapes and heads to Haddonfield to find his younger sister, with his psychiatrist Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) in pursuit. Michael finds his sister living with the Strode family, and going by the name Laurie. After killing all of her friends and family, Michael kidnaps Laurie and attempts to explain to her that he is her brother through the use of <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>that</b> he has kept of himself and her as an infant. Unable to understand, Laurie fights back; eventually, Laurie uses Loomis's gun to shoot Michael in the head. In 2009, a sequel to the remake, titled Halloween II, picks up right where the latter leaves off and then jumps ahead one year. Here, Michael (Mane) is presumed dead, but resurfaces after a vision of his deceased mother Deborah (Sheri Moon Zombie) informs him that he must track Laurie (Scout Taylor-Compton) down so that they can [...] "come home" [...] together. In the film, Michael and Laurie have a mental link, with the two sharing visions of their mother.|$|E
500|$|The Silent Hill series uses {{symbolism}} and psychology; {{the town of}} Silent Hill draws upon the psyche of its visitors, ultimately creating an [...] "otherworld," [...] a twisting of reality that manifests delusions and elements of their subconscious minds, varying from character to character. Specifically, {{in the case of}} Silent Hill 2s primary player character James Sunderland, the version of the town he explores is influenced by him. Many of the monsters that roam the town symbolize his guilt, wish for punishment, for wife's three-year-long illness, and cease to exist after James comes to terms {{with the fact that he}} killed his wife Mary, partially to end her suffering and partially out of resentment and frustration. James knew she had a terminal illness, which has been speculated to be cancer, and he often read medical textbooks, searching for something to help her. During her last days alive, she became physically repulsive as a result of the illness and treated James abusively, ordering him to leave one moment and begging him to comfort her the next. The knowledge of her terminal illness caused her to become angry and to hurt her loved ones, particularly James, and it pained him to visit her in the hospital. Pyramid Head functions as an executioner of Maria, a delusion of James' who strongly resembles Mary. Through Maria's repeated deaths, Pyramid Head reminds James of Mary's death and causes him to experience guilt and suffering. His appearance as an executioner stems from <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>that</b> James saw while visiting the town three years ago with Mary.|$|E
500|$|In Freaks, {{director}} Tod Browning of Dracula fame helms <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>that</b> {{depicts a}} traveling circus populated {{by a group}} of deformed carnival freaks. Browning populated the movie with actual carnival sideshow performers including [...] "midgets, dwarfs, hermaphrodites, Siamese twins, and, most awful, the armless and legless man billed as the 'living torso'". There is also a group of Pinheads, who are depicted as fortunate in that they are not mentally capable enough to understand that they disgust people. But the truly unsavory characters here are the villains, the circus strongman Hercules and the beautiful high-wire artist Cleopatra, who intends to marry and poison Hans, the midget heir who is enamored of her. At a dinner celebrating their union, one of the freaks dances on the table as they chant [...] "gooble-gobble, gobble, gobble, one of us, one of us, we accept her, we accept her." [...] Disgusted, Cleopatra insults Hans and makes out with Hercules in front of him. When the freaks discover her plot, they exact revenge by mutilating Cleopatra into a freak. Although, circus freaks were common in the early 1930s, the film was their first depiction on screen. Browning took care to linger over shots of the deformed, disabled performers with long takes of them including one of the [...] "living torso" [...] lighting a match and then a cigarette with his mouth. The film was accompanied by a sensational marketing campaign that asked sexual questions such as [...] "Do the Siamese Twins make love?", [...] "What sex is the half-man half-woman?", and [...] "Can a full grown woman truly love a midget?" [...] Surprisingly, given its reaction to Frankenstein, the state of Kansas objected to nothing in Freaks. However, other states, such as Georgia, were repulsed by the film and it was not shown in many locales. The film later became a cult classic spurred by midnight movie showings, but it was a box-office bomb in its original release.|$|E
