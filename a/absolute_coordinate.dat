Early GIBs were created for broad ocean area weapons testing by modifying conventional Navy sonobuoys with small OEM-grade GPS receivers and deploying them from a helicopter or from P-3 Orion aircraft. [...] The GPS data captured by the GIB was modulated over the analog VHF acoustic data stream using frequency-shift keying (FSK). This allows the GPS measurement {{data to be transmitted}} and received on legacy VHF sonobuoy receiver equipment. A drifting array of twelve or more GIBs would be deployed in a concentric circular array approximately 7 nm in diameter. Weapon strikes within the array emitted acoustic signatures that were captured by the GIBs and transmitted up to the orbiting aircraft.

40|$|Triangular {{patterns}} {{phase shifting}} profilometry {{is a method}} of structured light whose three-dimensional reconstructions are susceptible to error from gamma distortion. In practice, the luminance nonlinearity caused by the gamma distortion effect of a digital projector and a digital camera yields undesired fringe intensity changes, which substantially reduce the measurement accuracy, and while {{the effects of the}} gamma distortion diminish with an increasing number of employed phase-shifted patterns. A gamma correction method based on the pre-coding of projected grating is proposed to reduce the measurement error caused by the gamma distortion. By applying an appropriate pre-coding value to the projected patterns, the gamma distortion effect is attenuated and the accuracy is enhanced. The linear least square is compensated the <b>absolute</b> <b>coordinate</b> residuals still existing after gamma correction. To verify the presented method in this paper, a 3 D shape measurement experimental system is constructed using digital video projector and CCD camera. The experiment results shown that, the gamma pre-coding correction reduce the maximum residuals error of <b>absolute</b> <b>coordinate</b> by 72. 2 %. After the linear least square compensation, the maximum <b>absolute</b> <b>coordinate</b> residual is only 6. 1 % of without any correction or compensation.

Controlling hand position in the <b>absolute</b> <b>coordinate</b> system with short delay while walking is a important function for real-izing such motions as visual feedback reaching while walking, walking using handrail, and opening doors while walking. Based on previously developed online walking control system, fast dynamically stable walking trajectory generation system that preserves designed hand trajectory in <b>absolute</b> <b>coordinate</b> system, and sensor feedback balance maintaining system that also preserves given hand position are developed. Then a torso transition planner that generates desired torso movement of every one step from the absolute hand trajectory is implemented.

40|$|In many mobile {{wireless}} {{applications such}} as the automated driving of cars, formation flying of unmanned air vehicles, and source localization or target tracking with wireless sensor networks, {{it is more important}} to know the precise relative locations of nodes than their <b>absolute</b> <b>coordinates.</b> GPS, the most ubiquitous localization system available, generally provides only <b>absolute</b> <b>coordinates.</b> Furthermore, low-cost receivers can exhibit tens of meters of error or worse in challenging RF environments. This paper presents an approach that uses GPS to derive relative location information for multiple receivers. Nodes in a network share their raw satellite measurements and use this data to track the relative motions of neighboring nodes as opposed to computing their own <b>absolute</b> <b>coordinates.</b> The system has been implemented using a network of Android phones equipped with a custom Bluetooth headset and integrated GPS chip to provide raw measurement data. Our evaluation shows that centimeter-scale tracking accuracy at an update rate of 1 Hz is possible under various conditions with the presented technique. This is more than an order of magnitude more accurate than simply taking the difference of reported <b>absolute</b> node <b>coordinates</b> or other simplistic approaches due to the presence of uncorrelated measurement errors...|$|R
