40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{simple and}} {{inexpensive}} hydride generation system {{that uses a}} pyrex boiling tube as a reduction vessel to hold the acidified sample into which 2 cm 3 of 100 - 300 mg sodium tetrahydroborate (III) solution is injected such that the excess molecular hydrogen evolved carries the generated arsine directly through the atomic absorption spectrophotometer nebuliser to a nitrogen-hydrogen entrained air flame for <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>measurement</b> is described. The average absorption by arsenic atoms generated from the total arsine evolved was measured by integrating the absorbance for 16 seconds. The use of the absorption signal integration mode was found to free the technique from most kinetic interferences, while the stripping of the arsine from solution reduces the potential for chemical interferences in the solution phase. Gas flow rates affected sensitivity markedly, but the optimal flow rates for nitrogen and hydrogen were standardised on 90 cm 3 s- 1 and 30 cm 3 s- 1 respectively as a compromise between lower flow-rates giving longer arsenic residence times and higher sensitivity, and higher flow-rates giving a stiffer, less draught-sensitive flame. An optimum flame height of 6 mm above the burner produced sufficient atomization and low background absorption. Generally, sample volumes between 5 - 20 cm 3 {{could be used in}} different acidic media within the concentration range 10 % (v/v) – 50 % (v/v). The proposed system produced a significantly improved atomic absorption sensitivity of 25 ng and a detection limit of (95 % confidence) of 5. 2 ng for arsenic.

The dye laser system was foundtominimize the production of the continuum which in turn allowed a greater fraction of the energy to be transmitted to the sample surface at atmospheric pressure. The magnitude of the atmospheric pressure over the sample surface had a significant effect on both the duration and magnitude of the peak absorption of Mn in a reference steel sample. Spatially resolved <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>measurements</b> on the plume indicated that the plume was distributed over a much larger volume at low pressure (1 torr) than at atmospheric pressure. The plume appeared to be more uniform in composition at low pressure. <b>Absorption</b> line width <b>measurements</b> of the low pressure plume indicated that the temperature of the plasma had cooled dramatically from an estimated 10, 000 - 20, 000 ° K during its formation to 400 - 1000 ° K a few microseconds after the termination of the dye laser pulse. Its measured absorption width coupled with the reported values of the emission line widths of high intensity pulsed hollow cathode lamps indicated that a source with a narrower spectral profile was desirable for <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>measurements</b> in the plume.

These organs included the gills, mantle, foot, reproductive organs, adductor muscle, and viscera. After ashing and dissolving with nitric acid (8 M), each tissue was analyzed for ⁶⁵Zn by gamma-ray spectrometry. The determination of total zinc concentrations of the various organs was accomplished by <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> spectrophotometry {{as well as by}} neutron activation analysis. Variable amounts of both stable zinc and radioactive ⁶⁵Zn were observed within the specific tissues from a given location.

Both radiozinc and ⁶⁵Zn {{specific activity}} decreased with distance from the Columbia River mouth, whereas the stable zinc tended to remain uniform for a specific tissue.

W., Weaver, L. H., & Kester, W. R. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 8030 - 8044]. The mutant NP was isolated to homogeneity, and its structural, functional, calcium-binding, and stability properties were investigated. Proteolytic fragmentation with Staphylococcus aureus V 8 protease of mutant NP was used to isolate and analyze the protein fragment encompassing the site of mutation, unambiguously establishing the effective insertion of the new 10 -residue segment. <b>Atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>measurements</b> allowed us to demonstrate that mutant NP binds three calcium ions instead of the two ions bound to wild-type NP, showing that indeed the chain segment grafted from TLN to NP maintains its calcium-binding properties. The mutant NP showed kinetic parameters essentially {{similar to those of}} the wild-type NP with Z-Phe-Leu-Ala-OH as substrate. The enzyme inactivation of mutant vs wild-type NP was studied as a function of free [Ca 2 +]. It was found that mutant NP was much less stable than the wild-type NP when enzyme solutions were dialyzed at neutral pH in the presence of [Ca 2 +] below 10 (- 3) M. On the other hand, the kinetic thermal stability to irreversible inactivation of mutant NP, when measured in the presence of 0. 1 M CaCl 2, was found to be increased about 2 -fold over that of the wild-type NP. Thus, modulation of enzyme stability by free [Ca 2 +] in mutant NP correlates with similar findings previously reported for thermolysin. Overall, the results obtained indicate that protein engineering experiments can be used to prepare hybrid proteins on the basis of sequence and function analysis of homologous protein molecules and show the feasibility of engineering metal ion binding sites into proteins...|$|R
40|$|Transport and {{deposition}} of colloidal Fe, Mn and Al oxides play key {{roles in the}} cycling of toxic transition metals in aquatic environments because these colloids strongly bind transition metals. Further, attachment of biological cells and biofilm growth on surfaces can indirectly affect toxic metal distribution by influencing the {{deposition of}} colloidal oxides to surfaces. To elucidate the mechanisms governing these processes, deposition of colloidal oxides onto surfaces must be evaluated {{in the presence of}} suspended and adherent bacterial cells. Both particle size and concentration are expected to influence deposition. An experimental protocol was developed to determine the size distribution of iron colloids in mixtures with suspended cells. A Ti(III) reagent was used to reduce and dissolve colloidal Fe(III) from mixtures containing both suspended cells and Fe colloids. The size distribution of Fe(III) colloids in the original solution was then determined from the difference between size distributions before and after dissolution of Fe with Ti(III). The Ti(III) reagent dissolved over 95 % of the Fe colloids without altering the size distribution of suspended bacterial cells, and the method accurately determined the size distribution of Fe colloids added to cell suspensions. The applicability of this protocol was tested by applying it to a study of the deposition of Fe(III) oxide particles onto glass surfaces with and without biofilms of the bacterium Burkholdaria cepacia 17616. Experimental results using a laboratory biofilm reactor indicated that the deposition rate of Fe(III) colloids was not significantly affected by the presence of B. cepacia biofilms or by the presence of previously deposited Fe. However, deposition of Fe to reactor surfaces other than the glass surfaces may have interfered with the analyses, and <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>measurements</b> showed a slight increase in Fe deposition onto glass surfaces with biofilms present. Fe deposition to the composite of all reactor surfaces increased with increasing colloidal particle size, indicating a dominance of interception and/or sedimentation in controlling Fe deposition on surfaces in the biofilm reactor...|$|R
40|$|The binding {{of calcium}} to bilayer {{membranes}} composed of mixtures, in various proportions, of 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (POPC) plus 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoglycerol (POPG) was investigated by using <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> spectroscopy and deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance. The number of bound calcium ions, X 2, was determined {{in the low}} calcium concentration range (up to 100 mM) via <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> spectroscopy. Simultaneous <b>measurements</b> of the deuterium magnetic resonance spectra of POPC, specifically deuteriated at the alpha-methylene segment of the choline head group, revealed a linear relationship between the quadrupole splitting, delta vQ, and X 2 for each particular proportion of POPC-POPG. The amount of bound calcium was then determined at much greater calcium concentrations, where the <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> spectroscopy <b>measurements</b> were unreliable, using deuterium magnetic resonance. At low Ca 2 + concentrations, the amount of bound Ca 2 + increased linearly with increasing proportion of POPG, demonstrating an electrostatic contribution to Ca 2 + binding. At high Ca 2 + concentrations, the calcium binding isotherms exhibited saturation behavior with a maximum binding capacity of 0. 5 Ca 2 + and 1. 0 Ca 2 + per phospholipid for pure POPC and mixtures of POPC-POPG, respectively. Simultaneous deuteriation of POPG and POPC showed that both lipids remained in a fluidlike lipid bilayer at all Ca 2 + concentrations tested. Any phase separation of quasi-crystalline Ca 2 +-POPG clusters could be excluded. The residence time of Ca 2 + at an individual head group binding site was shorter than 10 (- 6) - 10 (- 5) s. Thus, Ca 2 + ions accumulate near the negatively charged POPG-POPC membrane surface but move freely in a "trough" of the electrical potential. The effective surface charge density, sigma, could be determined from the measured amount of bound Ca 2 +. Subsequently, the surface potential, psi 0, and the concentration of free Ca 2 + ions at the plane of ion binding could be calculated by employing the Gouy-Chapman theory. The availability of these parameters allowed a rigorous evaluation of various models for the chemical contribution to Ca 2 + binding. For mixed POPC-POPG bilayers, a simple Langmuir adsorption model yielded the best fit to the experimental data, and the binding constants were 19. 5 and 18. 8 M- 1 for POPG contents of 20 and 50 mol %, respectively. Sodium binding was comparatively weak with a binding constant of 0. 6 - 0. 85 M- 1. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|Fabric {{has always}} been {{prominent}} throughout history. In the last 70 years new synthetic fabrics have been developed which mimic the natural fibres but have increased strength, durability and stretchability. Common fibres include Polyester, Nylon and Lycra(R). These fibres can be blended to incorporate the properties of both the individual fibre types. Gold nanoparticles {{have been found to}} give the stable deep red colour found in stained glass but the science was not understood until the quantum mechanical work of Mie in 1908 on the interaction of electromagnetic radiation (visible light) with fine particles of matter. It is proposed that gold nanoparticles can be used as stable colourants bound to synthetic fibres and other textiles due to its chemical unreactivity. The most common formation method is the use of a reductant such as poly(ethylene imine), sodium citrate or tannic acid. This thesis reports the research and development of new, novel hybrid materials created by combining the interesting properties of both the synthetic fabrics and gold nanoparticles. Twenty five different methods (broken down into four general categories - pre-made colloids, in-situ reduction, use of external reductant after uptake of gold solution and growth of seed particles) were attempted resulting in fabrics that were a variety of shades and colours including pink, purple, tan and gold. The synthetic fabric-gold nanoparticle hybrid samples were analysed by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet/visible reflectance spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and ColourQuest measurements. A sample was also subjected to industry standard "abrasion" and colourfastness tests in which it gained the highest mark possible, showing no staining of other fabrics under dry rub conditions. <b>Atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>measurements</b> were performed on solutions after the fabric was removed in order to confirm the amount of gold uptake by the fabric samples. Analysis showed that a range of nanoparticle sizes and shapes were produced which influenced the visual colour of the fabric. The purple samples produced are caused by small particles (500 nm) that are either made up of small spheres fused together or are large plates (trigonal, hexagonal); therefore, Mie's laws do not appear to apply. Light coloured samples generally have a few small particles (< 100 nm) that are spaced out over the fibre surface...|$|R
40|$|Removal of {{extracellular}} calcium {{may result}} in depolarization of the resting cell membrane potential. This {{has been attributed to}} the stabilizing action of calcium on the ionic permeability of the cell membrane. It is unknown whether this phenomenon is exclusively mediated by extracellular calcium or through associated changes in intracellular calcium. To examine this, we exposed rat aortic smooth muscle cells in culture to different calcium concentrations and studied their effects on the resting membrane potential and intracellular calcium activity. The resting membrane potential was dependent on the extracellular potassium concentration. Exposure to reduced extracellular calcium concentrations (0. 25 and 0. 5 mM) caused a steep and reversible depolarization of the membrane potential, but intracellular calcium, measured with fura 2 -AM, was not reduced below that measured in control conditions (1. 8 mM). <b>Atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> spectrophotometric <b>measurements</b> did not indicate a measurable gain in cell sodium after reduction of extracellular calcium levels. We conclude that extracellular calcium controls the resting cell membrane potential of vascular smooth muscle through a mechanism that is independent of cytosolic Ca 2 + activity. (Hypertension 1989; 14 : 549 - 555) There is evidence that extracellular calcium([Ca 2 +]o) is an important regulator of arterialblood pressure, 1 - 2 possibly acting throug...|$|R
