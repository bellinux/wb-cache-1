40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: Evaluation of a {{protocol}} of activation-deactivation of <b>alarm</b> <b>soundings</b> on noninvasive {{mean arterial pressure}} (MAP) monitoring. Materials and methods: 103 patients were analyzed. <b>Alarm</b> <b>soundings</b> on noninvasive MAP were either activated (group A) or inactivated (group NA) according to {{a protocol}} based on patient's hemodynamic status. RESULTS: In {{the first part of}} the study (11 periods of 24 hours), we informed the nursing staff before data collection. In the second part of the study (11 periods of 24 hours), we did not inform the nursing staff before data collection. Results of the two parts were assembled and the final analysis consisted of 3, 304 hours of monitoring with 12, 839 noninvasive MAP measurements, 6, 354 in group A and 6, 485 in group NA. In group A, 75 of 944 (8 %) of abnormal measurements were detected or managed with a delay > 15 minutes and among them 16 required a therapeutic adjustment. In group NA, 140 of 265 (53 %) of abnormal measurements were detected or managed with a delay > 15 minutes and among them, only one required a therapeutic adjustment. The number of <b>alarm</b> <b>soundings</b> avoided in group NA was 286. CONCLUSION: In this study, a systematic activation of <b>alarm</b> <b>soundings</b> for non-invasive blood pressure monitoring seemed unnecessary for the safety of ICU patients...|$|R

50|$|In October 2013, Nest {{announced}} its second product, the Nest Protect smoke and carbon monoxide detector. The Nest Protect {{is available in}} {{both black and white}} (the black is exclusively sold through Nest directly) and also comes in battery or AC-powered models. The Nest Protect features a multicolored light ring which is color-coded to indicate different operations, such as yellow to indicate an early warning or red if an <b>alarm</b> is <b>sounding.</b> The ring also has a motion detector which turns it white briefly when someone passes under to provide illumination. The Nest Protect is voice-activated and warns of an <b>alarm</b> <b>sounding</b> briefly before it does. It is also able to communicate with the Nest Thermostat to provide the Auto-Away feature information that someone is present in the house, as well as to shut off the furnace {{in the event of a}} fire or carbon monoxide. The Nest Protect also features a controversial Wave Silence feature to stop an <b>alarm</b> from <b>sounding</b> with a wave in the event of a potential false alarm. It is available for sale in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Ireland and the Netherlands.|$|R

50|$|Inattentional {{blindness}} is also {{prevalent in}} aviation. The development of heads-up display (HUD) for pilots, which projects information onto the windshield or onto a helmet-mounted display, has enabled pilots {{to keep their}} eyes on the windshield, but simulator studies have found that HUD may cause runway incursion accidents, where one plane collides with another on the runway. This finding is particularly concerning because HUDs are being employed in automobiles, which could lead to potential roadway incursions. When a particular object or event captures attention {{to the extent to which}} the beholders' attentional capacity is completely absorbed, the resulting inattentional blindness has been known to cause dramatic accidents. For example, an airliner crew, engrossed with a blinking console light, failed to notice the approaching ground and register hearing the danger <b>alarm</b> <b>sounding</b> before the airliner crashed.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to distress signals like Mayday and pan-pan, most vessels, especially passenger ships, use some emergency signals {{to alert the}} crew on board, and in some cases, also the passengers.

50|$|The {{classical}} conditioning paradigm components for the bell and pad method are the following: The unconditioned stimulus (US) is the awakening stimulus or the alarm sound, the unconditioned response (UR) is the awakening response and sphincter contraction, the neutral stimulus (NS) {{is the feeling}} produced by bladder distention (feeling of having a full bladder), the conditioned stimulus (CS) is the feeling produced by bladder distention, and the conditioned response (CR) is the awakening response and sphincter contraction. Initially the individual experiences the <b>alarm</b> <b>sounding</b> (activated by urination) (US) eliciting the awakening response and sphincter contraction (UR) to wake up, stop urinating, and travel to the bathroom. After continued pairing of the alarm sound (US) with {{the feeling of a}} full bladder (NS), the previous NS of feeling a full bladder becomes the CS and elicits the waking response (CR) of waking up to go use the bathroom and urinate.|$|R

50|$|The fallacy {{arises from}} {{confusing}} the natures {{of two different}} failure rates. The 'number of non-bells per 100 terrorists' and the 'number of non-terrorists per 100 bells' are unrelated quantities. One does not necessarily equal the other, and they don't {{even have to be}} almost equal. To show this, consider what happens if an identical alarm system were set up in a second city with no terrorists at all. As in the first city, the alarm sounds for 1 out of every 100 non-terrorist inhabitants detected, but unlike in the first city, the alarm never sounds for a terrorist. Therefore, 100% of all occasions of the <b>alarm</b> <b>sounding</b> are for non-terrorists, but a false negative rate cannot even be calculated. The 'number of non-terrorists per 100 bells' in that city is 100, yet P(T | B) = 0%. There is zero chance that a terrorist has been detected given the ringing of the bell.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This article {{explores the}} {{potential}} of virtual reality (VR) to study burglary by measuring user responses on the subjective, physiological, and behavioral levels. Furthermore, it examines the influence of individual dispositions, such as sensation seeking and self-control, on behavior during a virtual burglary event. Methods: Participants, male university undergraduates (N ¼ 77), could freely move around a virtual neighborhood wearing a VR headset and using a game controller and were instructed to burgle {{one of the houses}} in the neighborhood. Participant movement, items stolen from the house, and heart rate (HR) were recorded throughout the burglary event. Individual dispositions were measured before, and subjective user responses were measured after, the event. Additionally, we experimentally varied whether there was an <b>alarm</b> <b>sounding</b> and participants’ beliefs about the chance of getting caught (deterrence). Results: Participants reacted subjectively to the burglary event by reporting high levels of presence in the virtual environment (VE) and physiologically by showing increased HRs. In terms of behavior, high deterrence resulted in fewer items being stolen and a shorter burglary. Furthermore, sensation seekers stole more valuable items, while participants high in conscientiousness stole fewer items. Conclusions: The results suggest that VEs have substantial potential for studying criminal behavior...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} a selective activation of <b>sounding</b> <b>alarms</b> on non-invasive blood pressure (BP) monitoring {{according to the}} patient haemodynamic status. Study design: Prospective study. Methods: Activation of alarms on BP was regulated with a protocol. Sounding alarms were either inactivated when patient's haemodynamic status was stable (group 1), or activated when it was unstable (group 2). The frequency of BP measurement was one every 15 min. For all mean BP value recorded, the following criteria were analyzed: 1) normality of the value compared to ranges 65 - 115 mmHg in group 1 or compared to alarm thresholds in group 2; 2) consequences on the care and therapeutic; 3) delay when an abnormal value was detected and managed after more than 15 min. Results: 1, 674 hours of monitoring from 42 patients, allowed the analysis of 6, 695 measurements of mean BP, 3, 092 in group 1 and 3, 603 in group 2. In group 1, 2, 822 measurements were considered as normal and 3, 094 measures in group 2. Eight measurements had consequences on therapeutic in group 1, with only one with delay in care giving. 287 measurements had consequences on therapeutic in group 2, 8 with delay in care giving. Six per cent of abnormal measurements in group 2 were managed with delay. This protocol reduced by 52 % the production of <b>sounding</b> <b>alarms</b> on BP, without noxious effects for the patients. Conclusion: Selective activation of <b>sounding</b> <b>alarms</b> on BP, according to the patient haemodynamic status, reduced noise pollution and could be one solution to improve monitoring efficiency in intensive care unit.

40|$|I was {{managing}} the construction project, and I thought my biggest challenge was simply finishing {{the work in}} time for start of the holiday shopping season. The store opened three weeks before Thanksgiving. Everything looked great. Business picked up steadily as the serious spending season approached. Then, two days before Thanksgiving, disaster struck. The fire protection system was designed to prevent smoke and fire from reaching the merchandise. If a fire alarm went off anywhere in the building, the system went into a massive pressurization mode. Dampers would open and the system would pump in hundreds of cubic feet of air from outside into the store, pressurizing every square foot, preventing fire or smoke from spreading into the store. That night an unknown event tripped the alarm-and it sounded for six hours. The air conditioning system was still operational as the outside air temperatures had been warm all month. That night, however, temperatures plummeted to 20 degrees. With an <b>alarm</b> <b>sounding</b> in a building complex that covers many millions of square feet, no one {{paid attention to the}} cold air flowing into the space. Pipes froze and burst. Hundreds of gallons of water came down through the drywall, soaking merchandise, the carpet and the hardwood racks.

40|$|More {{and more}} people in the United Kingdom are using the {{telephone}} to interact with suppliers of goods and services. This growth of call centre usage has required {{an increase in the number}} of call centre workers; an estimated 2 % of the UK working population is now employed in call centres 1. This relatively new occupation has found itself subject to a longrecognised occupational hazard: acoustic shock. Acoustic shock is broadly defined as a sudden and unexpected burst of noise transmitted through the call handler’s headset; this noise is usually high frequency. The signal may be caused by interference on the telephone line, by mis-directed faxes, or by a smoke or fire <b>alarm</b> <b>sounding</b> at the caller’s end. There have been instances of malicious callers blowing whistles into the sending handset. The level of such unexpected acoustic events may be subjectively high, much greater than the call handler’s desired speech listening level. However, the earphone output level may have been limited by fast-acting compression circuitry in the call-handling equipment, or as a last resort by peak-clipping in the earphone itself. For headsets as worn by call centre workers, the maximum output sound pressure level is limited to 118 decibels re 20 mN or to 118 dB(A) 2, 3, 4. In response to such unexpected loud sounds, the natural reaction is to remove the headset quickly, thus limiting the exposure duration to a few seconds. The call handler may be shocked or startled by the piercing noise, but exposure to these acoustic events is not sufficient to cause hearing loss as assessed by conventional methods. However, other auditory and neurological symptoms may develop, resulting in a personal injury claim against the call handler’s employer. This paper presents summaries of the symptoms of eighteen UK call centre workers making compensation claims. The findings are taken from the reports by claimants’ and defendants’ medical examiners...|$|R
