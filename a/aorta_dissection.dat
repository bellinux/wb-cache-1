40|$|ObjectiveLimited {{long-term}} outcome {{data are}} available on survival {{and the need for}} aortic root or valve reoperation after surgery for acute ascending <b>aorta</b> <b>dissection.</b> We report our 42 -year experience. MethodsWe reviewed the records of 269 patients who had undergone surgery for acute ascending <b>aorta</b> <b>dissection</b> from July 1969 to June 2011. The mean age at surgery was 62. 1 ± 15. 2 years, and 181 were men (67. 3 %). The distal operation was limited to hemiarch replacement. The proximal aortic operation groups included a composite valve conduit in 66 patients (24. 5 %), aortic root repair in 112 (41. 6 %), and isolated supracoronary ascending aorta replacement in 91 (33. 8 %). ResultsOperative morbidity occurred in 224 patients (83. 3 %) and mortality in 44 (16. 4 %), with similar rates among the groups (P = . 894 and P = . 466, respectively). The mean follow-up was 9. 7 ± 7. 5 years. The Kaplan-Meier survival estimate at 10 and 20 years was 65. 5 % ± 3. 6 % and 28. 7 % ± 4. 3 %, respectively, and was similar among the groups (P = . 227). Reoperation on the aortic root or valve occurred in 20 patients (8. 9 %) at a median of 6. 8 years (range, 0. 2 - 20. 3). The freedom from reoperation rate at 10 and 20 years was 91. 5 % ± 2. 3 % and 79. 3 % ± 6. 1 %, respectively, with no difference among the groups (P = . 605). ConclusionsOperative morbidity and mortality rates are significant after repair of acute ascending <b>aorta</b> <b>dissection.</b> Aortic root surgery can be performed without an apparent increase in the prevalence of operative morbidity or mortality; however, patients remain at risk of subsequent aortic root or valve surgery...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo analyse our {{experience}} with {{endovascular stent graft}} repair of descending <b>aorta</b> <b>dissections</b> that require supraaortic branch vessel revascularisation. DesignRetrospective study. MethodsFrom 2001 to 2009, 22 consecutive patients with the above dissections were retrospectively analysed. Inclusion requirement: aortic landing zone proximal to the left subclavian artery of less than 15  mm. Hybrid, scalloped or fenestrated endovascular stent grafts were selected based on dissection characteristics. Annual follow-up visits (median 27. 1 months) included computed tomography angiography. End points include progressive pathology, complications and survival rates. ResultsSurgery was successful in all except for one operative complication. Two patients died within 30 days after surgery, one to cerebral infarction {{and the other to}} myocardial infarction. No postoperative complications occurred in the remaining patients. Thrombosis formed in the aortic false lumen of the graft exclusion segment in all patients. The maximum diameter of this segment decreased in 18 patients and was stable in two. In 19 patients, blood flow remained in the false lumen distal to the exclusion area not covered by stent. Patency was seen at mid- and long-term follow-up, without proximal endoleak, graft displacement or deaths. ConclusionEndovascular stent graft methods show promise in endovascular stent graft repair of proximal descending aortic dissections involving the distal arch...|$|R

5000|$|Open aortic surgery ("OAS", {{also known}} as Open aortic repair, [...] "OAR") {{describes}} a technique whereby an abdominal or retroperitoneal surgical incision is used to visualize and control the aorta for purposes of treatment.

In 2003, OAS was surpassed by endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) as the most common technique for repairing abdominal aortic aneurysms in the United States. In OAS for abdominal aortic aneurysm, the aneurysmal portion of the aorta is replaced with a graft, usually made of dacron or PTFE.|$|R

Aortic clamping proximal to the left subclavian artery in a patient with an aberrant right subclavian artery slows or eliminates flow to both vertebral arteries.
