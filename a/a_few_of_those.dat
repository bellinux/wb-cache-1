5|$|For {{those with}} pain {{localized}} {{to the lower}} back due to disc degeneration, fair evidence supports spinal fusion as equal to intensive physical therapy and slightly better than low-intensity nonsurgical measures. Fusion may be considered for those with low back pain from acquired displaced vertebra that does not improve with conservative treatment, although only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who have spinal fusion experience good results. There {{are a number of}} different surgical procedures to achieve fusion, with no clear evidence of one being better than the others. Adding spinal implant devices during fusion increases the risks but provides no added improvement in pain or function.|$|E
5|$|The 2000s saw {{formation}} of several pioneering Oriental metal bands from the Arab world, the best-known {{of which is}} Myrath from Tunisia. They have released four albums (three internationally) and have toured in Europe with Orphaned Land. Their sound combined progressive metal (in the vein of Dream Theater, et al.) with specifically Arab & North African melodies and themes. The Kordz from Lebanon straddle the line between hard rock and progressive metal, and again draw on local folk melodies (produced mainly via keyboards) to broaden the sonic palette. Hard rock band Lazywall from Morocco frequently makes use of oud and djembe in their music, producing something analogous to Oriental metal (though generally no heavier than Alice in Chains). North Africa has had a growing metal scene for some time, and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> bands have ventured into folk-metal, notably Andaz Azzul from Algeria, which blends Berber melodies & themes with violin and metal. And Egypt's truly path-breaking female-fronted Oriental metal band Massive Scar Era has recently broken through and has posted official videos on YouTube, though they continue to face considerable discrimination at home, with frontwoman Sherine reporting harassment on account of her participation. Their sound has broadened to include the heavy use of violin (in effect making them a folk-metal band, rather than simply another of the growing profusion of heavy metal bands in the Middle East).|$|E

Around 12 crew members climbed on board Collapsible B, and they rescued those they could until some 35 men were clinging precariously to the upturned hull. Realising the risk to the boat of being swamped by the mass of swimmers around them, they paddled slowly away, ignoring the pleas of dozens of swimmers to be allowed on board. In his account, Gracie wrote of the admiration he had for those {{in the water}}; [...] "In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke from a swimmer because of a refusal to grant assistance... was met with the manly voice of a powerful man... 'All right boys, good luck and God bless you'."

Its occupants had to sit for hours in a foot of freezing water, and many died of hypothermia during the night.|$|E

500|$|Whereas most {{comic book}} and pulp adaptations were box office {{failures}} in the 1980s, Conan the Barbarian {{was one of the}} few that made a profit. [...] According to Sammon, it became the standard against which sword and sorcery films were measured until the debut of Peter Jackson's [...] in 2001; several contemporary films of the same genre were judged by critics to be clones of Conan, such as The Beastmaster (1982). [...] Conans success inspired low-budget copycats, such as Ator, the Fighting Eagle (1982) and Deathstalker (1983). [...] Its sequel, Conan the Destroyer, was produced and released in 1984; only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> involved in the first film, such as Schwarzenegger, Mako, and Poledouris, returned. [...] Later big- and small-screen adaptations of Robert E. Howard's stories were considered by Sammon to be inferior to the film that started the trend. [...] A spinoff from Conan was a 20-minute live-action show, , that ran from 1983 to 1993 at Universal Studios Hollywood.
