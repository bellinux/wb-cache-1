Not only has the coverage range of insured persons expanded, insurance benefits are also increasing as the labor demands increase. But a call for further reform is emerging in recent years. In particular, workers without a fixed employer and self-employed workers, as members of trade unions, have not been able to participate in employment insurance. For the former, although it is legally possible, it is difficult in practice; while for the latter, it is not possible in accordance with the law. To enhance the coverage range of employment insurance, it is necessary to reform the laws and regulations concerning employment insurance.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} theoretical arguments, empirical evidence, and econometric {{findings to}} support the statement that rational economic policies depend qualitatively on stages of development that are defined by productivity and institutional indicators of a country. We consider the impact of industrial policies, speed of foreign exchange reserves accumulation, technology transfers and immigration policies, as well as FDI and liberalization of capital flows, on rate of economic growth. It is argued that the impact may be positive or negative; in many cases a threshold combination of GDP per capita and institutional quality indicators may be found to separate two different outcomes. A precondition of economic success is the timely switching of economic policies to avoid both types of mistakes: excessive inertia or premature use of instruments that are effective for more <b>advance</b> <b>countries</b> only. The stage of development theory implies that international financial institutions (including IMF, WB, and EBRD) should work out a list of differentiated prescriptions that may be efficiently followed by countries with different levels of institutional and technological development, and so the system of assistance to developing countries could be improved.

However compare to success of Indian pharmaceutical industry other crucial sectors in healthcare industry such as medical device industry has not witnessed similar growth.

Evidence presented in this paper is based on the case studies of innovative products and firms in both sectors and for data analysis theoretical framework based on innovation systems literature is used. Initial findings suggest that highly knowledge intensive sector such as medical device requires interactive ecosystem of institutions compared to development of innovations in pharmaceutical industry. Further innovative product development in medical device industry is associated to firms and institutions working closely with practitioners and users unlike pharmaceutical product development where collaboration involves firms working with R&D institute and universities. Research reveals that in post independent era Indian government set up CSIR and other research institutes that created basic ecosystem which supported first, imitation and then innovation in Indian pharmaceutical industry.

40|$|In recent years, many {{so-called}} {{developed countries}} {{had to change}} their competitive strategies, due to the emergence on the international scenario of countries based on low labour costs. A growing number of studies signals {{the need for the}} <b>advance</b> <b>countries</b> to increase the technological content of their products, {{while at the same time}} dealing with increasingly fragmented and integrated production systems and more and more complex innovation processes. This implies the necessity to look for external knowledge sources and growing interactions between firms and university, in an increasing process of technology transfer. Technology transfer can take place in different ways and different modalities. Among the most studied we find spin offs, i. e. firms created by academicians or students in order to develop the results of their research. Much has been written on their origin, development and performances. However, very rarely these firms arise spontaneously. More often they are the result of a complex decision process related to the personal evaluation of the founder on a wide variety of elements. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that support to spin offs does not only mean financial subsidies or firm incubators, but also stimulation of the propensity of academicians towards entrepreneurship. Starting from the Theory of Planned Behavior introduced by Icek Ajzen in 1991, the present work is aimed at identifying the main determinants of the decision of academics of becoming entrepreneurs, testing then the identified determinants by means of a case study carried out among scholars of three Californian universities: UCLA, University of California San Diego and Stanford University.

The relatively <b>advance</b> <b>countries</b> lose competitive advantages in product groups intensive in unskilled labor and shift to products and processes, intensive in capital, skilled labor and innovation. Sri Lanka being a labour abundant country it is logical to demonstrate its competitive advantage in clothing manufacturing. However country is progressively losing the ultimate advantage they had on labor. Even by the mid 1990 s labour cost in Sri Lanka were higher than in neighboring countries such as China, India Pakistan and Vietnam. In addition to increasing labour costs Sri Lankan apparel manufactures are to be' confronted with decreasing prices due to increasing competition and additional upward pressures are exerted on the manufacturers by high absenteeism and employee turnovers. Although high mechanization and better utilization of human resource are considered as counter moves to combat increasing manufacturing costs the former has limited practical value due to frequent style mix changes.

40|$|Background: Drugs {{have become}} an {{essential}} necessity in public health, people {{and the government has}} become willingly to spend more money on the country’s healthcare system to restore health, save lives, preventing disease and epidemics. Drugs should be properly regulated throughout development, production, importation and subsequent distribution to ensure it is prescribed with safe, effective and of good quality standards. The structure of drug regulations today has evolved over time. During the process, the scope of legislative and regulatory power expanded in result of a series of disastrous events related to pharmaceutical products, the adoption of more restrictive legislative were put in place for stronger safeguard to the public. In comparison to Singapore, Taiwan, US and EU where the drug regulatory system is highly structured, flexible and innovative, Hong Kong (HK) has a relatively simple and stubborn drug regulatory system and drug approval is greatly dependent on the approval status of the <b>advance</b> <b>countries.</b> According to the current registration system in HK, a new drug usually takes about 18 - 24 months to obtain an approval, and this figure is far behind the standard of Singapore in which medicine could be registered in 60 days. It is vital to have speedy approval process with high standards in safety, efficacy and quality on all approved drugs. If drugs are approved in a rush manner, it will lead to serious adverse drug reactions (ADR), or even deaths in consumption of unsafe, and ineffective drugs. On the other hand, slow approval will make patients suffer and increase the mortality rate to due inaccessibility of appropriate medicines to sustain life and combat diseases. With reference to the initiatives and innovative regulatory frameworks in the abovementioned countries, the modification of the local drug regulatory system is strongly recommended. Aim: 	 1. To examine the regulatory frameworks between Singapore, Taiwan, US and EU which affect the evaluation timeline required for new drugs approval. 2. As the first study to examine the drug regulations in HK, the regulatory barriers for new drugs submission will be explored and whether the regulatory initiatives from the abovementioned countries may result in an improvement in the overall drug regulation system HK. Method: This dissertation is a literature review and it will employ concentration in the drug regulation systems in Singapore, Taiwan, US and EU with varying levels of pharmaceutical regulation capacities. Search engines including Google, MedLine, PubMed (database up to 2012) with key words search of “Department of Health (DoH), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Union (EU), Taiwan FDA, Health Sciences Authority, evaluation routes, drug registration requirement, review timeline, Centre for Drug Evaluation, Pharmaceutical Evaluation Reports, risk management systems, pharmacovigilance, drug legislation”. Results: With an in-depth evaluation of the HK’s guideline and supporting document required for new drug submission, it is highly recommended that unnecessary documents at new drug submission (NDA) should be elimination to facilitate the new drugs approval process. The regulatory frameworks between all studied countries vary significantly in which implementation of initiatives (e. g. multiple evaluation routes, in-house evaluation system) from individual country affects the standards of new drugs approval and the evaluation timeline required to grant approvals. Conclusion: The regulatory frameworks in HK shall be revised with reference to numerous initiatives developed in the regulatory systems in Singapore, Taiwan, Us and EU. The possible key regulatory barriers which leads to the delays in new drugs approvals in HK includes duplication of certificates, limited number of Pharmacy and Poison Board meetings, the requirement of endorsement of new drugs approvals at the legislative council, absence of in-house evaluation system which allows full assessment of submission dossier, deficiency of clinical trials with the inclusion of local population, absence of electronic submission, multiple evaluation routes and rigorous post-marketing pharmacovigilance monitoring system. If the Department of Health (DoH) in Hong Kong could scrutinize the current regulatory frameworks with referenced to these countries, it will improve the overall drug regulatory system and reduce drug lag due to unnecessary barriers. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|E
