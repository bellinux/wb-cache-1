5|$|The German {{influence}} {{brought into}} Norway by neo-classicism abated when Norway gained full independence in 1905. A {{new generation of}} Norwegian architects educated in Sweden {{took the lead in}} developing <b>a</b> <b>distinctly</b> national architecture, endeavouring to break the German historicist tradition. However, German modernism and town planning continued to influence early 20th-century architecture. As the Norwegian Institute of Technology was founded in 1910 and began to teach architecture in Trondheim, there also emerged <b>a</b> <b>distinctly</b> Norwegian collegium of architects that has contributed to a Norwegian regional architecture, discussed by the art historian Sigfried Giedeon.|$|E
5|$|Achebe's novels laid a {{formidable}} groundwork for this process. By altering syntax, usage, and idiom, he transforms the language into <b>a</b> <b>distinctly</b> African style.

5|$|During {{these years}} Gaudí {{completed}} {{a series of}} works with <b>a</b> <b>distinctly</b> oriental flavour, inspired by {{the art of the}} Middle and Far East (India, Persia, Japan), as well as Islamic-Hispanic art, mainly Mudejar and Nazari. Gaudí used ceramic tile decoration abundantly, as well as Moorish arches, columns of exposed brick and pinnacles in the shape of pavilions or domes.|$|E
5|$|Her {{first solo}} album My Winter Storm (2007) {{contains}} rock and metal songs {{as well as}} songs that resemble classical songs.

It has a quicker, deeper wingbeat than do other loons.|$|E

5|$|As Lord President of the Council, Dudley headed <b>a</b> <b>distinctly</b> conciliar {{government}} {{and sought to}} introduce the adolescent King into business. Taking over an almost bankrupt administration, he ended the costly wars with France and Scotland and tackled finances in ways that led to some economic recovery. To prevent further uprisings he introduced countrywide policing on a local basis, appointing Lords Lieutenants who were {{in close contact with}} the central authority. Dudley's religious policy was—in accordance with Edward's proclivities—decidedly Protestant, further enforcing the English Reformation and promoting radical reformers to high Church positions.|$|E

5|$|Canada has a {{well-developed}} media sector, but {{its cultural}} output; particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines, is often overshadowed by imports from the United States. As a result, {{the preservation of}} <b>a</b> <b>distinctly</b> Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and {{institutions such as the}} Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).|$|E
5|$|From the 2nd to the 4th centuries, the Christian {{authors who}} would become the Latin Church Fathers were in active {{dialogue}} with the Classical tradition, within {{which they had been}} educated. Tertullian, a convert to Christianity from Roman Africa, was the contemporary of Apuleius and one of the earliest prose authors to establish <b>a</b> <b>distinctly</b> Christian voice. After the conversion of Constantine, Latin literature is dominated by the Christian perspective. When the orator Symmachus argued for the preservation of Rome's religious traditions, he was effectively opposed by Ambrose, the bishop of Milan and future saint—a debate preserved by their missives.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{majority}} of medieval cathedrals, those of England are cruciform. While most are of the Latin Cross shape with a single transept, several including Salisbury, Lincoln, Wells and Canterbury have two transepts, which is <b>a</b> <b>distinctly</b> English characteristic. The transepts, unlike those of many French cathedrals, always project strongly. The cathedral, whether of monastic or secular foundation, often has several clearly defined subsidiary buildings, in particular the chapter house and cloister.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{structure}} of the Scottish royal court in the period before the reign of David I, but by the late thirteenth century, it had taken on <b>a</b> <b>distinctly</b> feudal character. The major offices were the steward or stewart, chamberlain, constable, marischal and chancellor. The office of stewart, responsible for management of the king's household, was created by David I and given as an hereditary office to Walter Fitzalan, whose descendants became the House of Stewart. The office was merged with the crown when Robert II inherited the throne.|$|E
5|$|Postan {{argued that}} {{demography}} {{was the principal}} driving force in the medieval English economy. In <b>a</b> <b>distinctly</b> Malthusian fashion, Postan proposed that the English agrarian economy saw little technical development during the period and by the early 14th century was unable to support the growing population, leading to inevitable famines and economic depression as the population came back into balance with land resources. Postan began the trend towards stressing continuities between the pre- and post-invasion economies, aided by fresh evidence emerging {{from the use of}} archaeological techniques to understand the medieval economy from the 1950s onwards.|$|E

5|$|The Georgia Tech {{campus is}} located in Midtown, an area north of {{downtown}} Atlanta. Although a number of skyscrapers—most visibly the headquarters of AT, The Coca-Cola Company, and Bank of America—are visible from all points on campus, the campus itself has few buildings over four stories and {{has a great deal}} of greenery.

5|$|The song {{begins with}} <b>a</b> <b>distinctly</b> Vivaldian style, as the fast tempo and classical-style chord {{progression}} anticipates {{the lyrics to}} follow. The opening chords and the melody emphasize the tonic of the leading notes: Fm–E–D–Cm–D–E–Fm–D–E–Fm, resembling a Baroque work. This {{is followed by the}} sound of dance music, produced by a powerful beat from the instruments. Madonna's vocal range spans from F3 to C5, and has a different sound from her previous work, more mature, centered, and with a lower range.|$|E
5|$|A {{handful of}} {{rooms in the}} modern State Apartments reflect either 18th-century or Victorian Gothic design. The State Dining Room, for example, whose current design {{originates}} from the 1850s but which was badly damaged during the 1992 fire, is restored to its appearance in the 1920s, before the removal {{of some of the}} gilded features on the pilasters. Anthony Salvin's Grand Staircase is also of mid-Victorian design in the Gothic style, rising to a double-height hall lit by an older 18th-century Gothic vaulted lantern tower called the Grand Vestibule, designed by James Wyatt and executed by Francis Bernasconi. The staircase has been criticised by historian John Robinson as being <b>a</b> <b>distinctly</b> inferior design to the earlier staircases built on the same site by both Wyatt and May.|$|E
