5|$|In {{the early}} hours of November 7, 1825, the day the General Assembly was to open its session, a man knocked on the door of Sharp's residence. When Sharp <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> the visitor grabbed him with his left hand and used his right to stab him in the heart with a {{poisoned}} dagger. Sharp died at approximately two o'clock in the morning. After lying in state in the House of Representatives Hall, he was buried in Frankfort Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|William Bell, Seward's butler, <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> when Powell knocked {{slightly}} after 10p.m. Powell told Bell {{that he had}} medicine from Seward's physician, {{and that}} his instructions were to personally show Seward how to take it. Overcoming Bell's skepticism, Powell made {{his way up the}} stairs to Seward's third-floor bedroom. At the top of the staircase he was stopped by Seward's son, Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W. Seward, to whom he repeated the medicine story; Frederick, suspicious, said his father was asleep.|$|E
5|$|Lana Tisdel's {{potential}} {{involvement in}} the {{rape and murder of}} Brandon Teena was also highlighted. Various people involved in the case, particularly Brandon's family, have alleged that Tisdel was somehow involved with the murders, or had at least set them up in an act of vengeance. Perhaps the most notable admission about Tisdel's motives came from Tom Nissen, who infamously confessed that Tisdel was present {{at the time of the}} murders in the car and had even tried knocking on the door of the farmhouse where Brandon, Lambert and DeVine were staying. When nobody <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> Nissen alleges that Lotter broke in while Tisdel waited in the vehicle while the murders were carried out. Tisdel denied this and a lack of evidence meant that it could not be vigorously pursued in the proceeding court case—the residing judge considered most of Nissen's claims as nothing more than hearsay. Not only did Tisdel vehemently deny any involvement in Brandon's murder, she denied ever being present at Lisa Lambert's farmhouse on the night Brandon was murdered. Unlike Tisdel's own evidence and the admissions presented in court, Boys Don't Cry took the liberty of placing Tisdel at the crime scene, albeit without any intention of setting Brandon up.|$|E

Back in the house they found pipes and {{connectors}} suitable for bombs hidden in the pantry, as well as three cheap pocket watches, flashlight batteries, brass terminal knobs, and unmatched wool socks of the type used to transport the bombs. Metesky had <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in pajamas; after he was ordered to get dressed for the trip to Waterbury Police Headquarters, he reappeared wearing a double-breasted suit, buttoned.|$|E
500|$|A plot {{to kidnap}} Douglas-Home in April 1964 was foiled by the Prime Minister himself. Two left-wing {{students}} from the University of Aberdeen {{followed him to the}} house of John and Priscilla Buchan, where he was staying. He was alone at the time and <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> where the students told him that they planned to kidnap him. He responded, [...] "I suppose you realise if you do, the Conservatives will win the election by 200 or 300." [...] He gave his intending abductors some beer, and they abandoned their plot.|$|E

500|$|Several {{observers}} {{have noted that}} foreign journalists {{were not allowed to}} interview the self-immolation victims recovering in hospitals. Even the victims' relatives were not permitted to speak with them, according to David Ownby. [...] Pan wrote that [...] "Beijing denied requests to interview Liu Siying and the three other survivors, who are all hospitalized... A Kaifeng official said only China Central Television and the official New China News Agency were permitted to speak to their relatives or their colleagues. A man who <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> at the Liu home referred questions to the government." [...] The survivors were interviewed by the state-run press, however. In one such interview, CCTV interviewed the 12-year-old Liu Siying. Government sources reported Liu Siying had undergone a tracheotomy shortly before the interview. Speaking through approved media outlets, she said that her own mother told her to set herself on fire to reach the [...] "heavenly golden kingdom"; journalist Danny Schechter doubted that the child {{would have been able to}} speak to the Chinese media so soon after a tracheotomy, yet Liu Siying appeared to be speaking clearly and singing in the interview.|$|E
2500|$|Tom Quong Kee was a 74-year-old laundry {{proprietor}} who was {{a member}} of the Bing Kong Tong in Mina, Nevada. Hughie Sing, his American-educated apprentice of two years, pointed Kee out as a target for Gee. During the night of August 27, 1921, Gee knocked on the door of Kee's residence while armed with a Colt [...]38 revolver. Gee fatally shot Kee, who <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in his pajamas. Unlike many other Tong killings, Gee and Sing were apprehended.|$|E
2500|$|At 7:03a.m. EDT, Officers Paul Sciullo and Stephen Mayhle of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police {{responded to}} a 9-1-1 call from Poplawski's mother over a {{domestic}} disturbance. [...] When the officers arrived at the scene, the mother <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> explaining that she wanted Poplawski out of the house. As the two officers entered the home, Poplawski was reportedly wearing a bulletproof vest and [...] "lying in wait". Sciullo was immediately shot in the head. Almost immediately thereafter, Officer Mayhle was also shot in the head.|$|E

25|$|Example: We visit every {{household}} {{in a given}} street, and interview {{the first person to}} <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> In any household with more than one occupant, this is a nonprobability sample, because some {{people are more likely to}} <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> (e.g. an unemployed person who spends most of their time at home is more likely to answer than an employed housemate who might be at work when the interviewer calls) and it's not practical to calculate these probabilities.|$|R
2500|$|Another story {{shows his}} partner Terence Reese {{picking up a}} {{collection}} of silver cup trophies from Schapiro's flat in Eaton Place (the Upstairs, Downstairs setting) and carrying them in a pillow-case. Stopped in the street by a policeman and asked to explain his unusual sack of possessions, Reese led the officer back to the flat so that Schapiro could validate his explanation. When Schapiro <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> he sized up the situation, and when asked [...] "Can you identify this man?", said [...] "Never seen him before in my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Government {{investigations}} into the killings culminated in {{the report of the}} [...] "Saikia Commission", presented to the Assam Assembly 15 November 2007. The report describes how the killings were organised by Prafulla Mahanta, then the Assam Home Minister. They were executed by the police, with co-operation from the Indian Army. The gunmen were former members of ULFA who had surrendered to the government. They approached their targets at home, at night, knocking on the door and speaking in Assamese to allay suspicion. When the victims <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> they were shot or kidnapped to be shot elsewhere.|$|E
2500|$|Jane Alsop {{reported}} {{that on the}} night of 19 February 1838, she <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of her father's house to a man claiming to be a police officer, who told her to bring a light, claiming [...] "we have caught Spring-heeled Jack here in the lane". She brought the person a candle, and noticed that he wore a large cloak. The moment she had handed him the candle, however, he threw off the cloak and [...] "presented a most hideous and frightful appearance", vomiting blue and white flame from his mouth while his eyes resembled [...] "red balls of fire". Miss Alsop {{reported that}} he wore a large helmet and that his clothing, which appeared to be very tight-fitting, resembled white oilskin. Without saying a word he caught hold of her and began tearing her gown with his claws which she was certain were [...] "of some metallic substance". She screamed for help, and managed to get away from him and ran towards the house. He caught her on the steps and tore her neck and arms with his claws. She was rescued by one of her sisters, after which her assailant fled.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the aid of}} Peter Guagenti, Fisher {{obtained}} a [...]25 caliber pistol and then went out to steal a set of license plates off a neighbourhood car. On May 19, 1992, Guagenti helped Fisher put the license plates on his Pontiac Firebird and then drove her to the Buttafuoco home in Massapequa, New York. Fisher later explained to the police that she had expected Guagenti {{to carry out the}} shooting, but he refused. When Mary Jo Buttafuoco <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> Fisher told her that Joey Buttafuoco {{was having an affair with}} Fisher's (imaginary) younger sister, providing a T-shirt advertising Buttafuoco's auto body shop for her [...] "proof." [...] The conversation lasted about 15 minutes, but Buttafuoco became increasingly angry with Fisher's claims. She finally told her to leave and then turned her back to go back into the house. Fisher then produced the gun, struck Buttafuoco in the head with it, and then aimed at her temple and fired. Buttafuoco fell to the ground, severely wounded. Fisher dropped the shirt and the gun and ran towards the car, but Guagenti told her to take the evidence with her, so she ran back to retrieve both items and then they both fled the scene. Neighbors called 911 and came to Buttafuoco's aid. She was operated on all night, and although unable to remove the bullet, the doctors were able to save her life.|$|E
