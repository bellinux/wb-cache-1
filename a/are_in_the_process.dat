5|$|Carisbrook, the city's former main rugby union venue and {{a former}} Test cricket ground, is at {{the eastern end of}} the suburb between The Glen and the Hillside Railway Workshops. It was the home of Otago Rugby Union until a new stadium opened in North Dunedin (the Forsyth Barr Stadium at University Plaza) in 2011. The new stadium is the new home of the Otago Rugby Union and Highlanders Super Rugby franchise, and met with some {{opposition}} within Dunedin, with objections focusing largely on the cost. The future of Carisbrook looks bleak, and many of the former facilities <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of being dismantled or removed.|$|E
5|$|Five more {{teenage girls}} head towards the estate, Kelli, Ashley, Lisa, Cindy, and Megan. S.C.A.T. {{was able to}} place agent Kelli Medd (Dana Plato) within the group as an {{undercover}} agent. The girls {{are not aware of}} her true identity. Also with the girls is Danny, Lisa's younger brother. What the gang does not know is the house is infested with Augers, vampiric beings that need blood to survive. The Martin family themselves <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of becoming vampires. The following events that take place and the ending vary widely depending on which characters the player is able to save from the Augers.|$|E

5|$|An {{increasingly}} popular conspiracy theory among American right-wing populists {{is that the}} hypothetical North American Union and the amero currency, proposed by the Council on Foreign Relations and its counterparts in Mexico and Canada, {{will be the next}} milestone in the implementation of the New World Order. The theory holds that a group of shadowy and mostly nameless international elites are planning to replace the federal government of the United States with a transnational government. Therefore, conspiracy theorists believe the borders between Mexico, Canada and the United States <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of being erased, covertly, by a group of globalists whose ultimate goal is to replace national governments in Washington, D.C., Ottawa and Mexico City with a European-style political union and a bloated E.U.-style bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|Consisting of two quasars with a {{separation}} of less than 5 arcseconds, the quasar pair 4C 11.50 {{is one of the}} visually closest pairs of quasars in the sky. The two have markedly different redshifts, however, and are thus unrelated. The foreground member of the pair (4C 11.50 A) does not have enough mass to refract light from the background component (4C 11.50 B) enough to produce a lensed image, although it does have a true companion of its own. An even stranger galaxy pair is 3C 321. Unlike the previous pair, the two galaxies making up 3C 321 are interacting with each other and <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of merging. Both members appear to be active galaxies; the primary radio galaxy may be responsible for the activity in the secondary by means of the former's jet driving material onto the latter's supermassive black hole.|$|E

5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily children, who have already developed or <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of developing this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking flexibly about them. Similarly, {{in order to be}} cognitively flexible they must overcome centration, which is the tendency for young children to solely focus on one aspect of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely able to focus on one aspect of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, then they will be more cognitively inflexible.|$|E
5|$|The Chiroptera {{as a whole}} <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> {{of losing}} the ability to {{synthesize}} vitamin C: most have lost it completely. In a test of 34 bat species from six major families of bats, including major insect- and fruit-eating bat families, all {{were found to have}} lost the ability to synthesize it, and this loss may derive from a common bat ancestor, as a single mutation. Earlier reports of only fruit bats being deficient were based on smaller samples. However, recent results show that {{there are at least two}} species of bat, the frugivorous bat (Rousettus leschenaultii) and insectivorous bat (Hipposideros armiger), that have retained their ability to produce vitamin C.|$|E
5|$|The National Archives of Malta, {{like its}} {{counterparts}} {{in other areas}} of the world, has been moving to increase the availability of its services on the Internet. A number of items in its collection have been, or <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of being, digitised, and a catalogue listing search, along with a short description of each item, is available online on the Archives' web site. The Archives releases many of its publications, including periodical newsletters, its annual report and the State of the Archives report, on its web site, and maintains an 'e-shop' to facilitate the sale of copies of some of its text and image holdings to interested members of the public. It is also possible to search the holdings of Malta's National Memory Project, a memory of those who have contributed to the history of Malta, through the Archives' web site.|$|E

5|$|The {{constellation}} {{does not}} lie on the galactic plane of the Milky Way, {{and there are no}} prominent star clusters. NGC 625 is a dwarf irregular galaxy of apparent magnitude 11.0 and lying some 12.7 million light years distant. Only 24000 light years in diameter, it is an outlying member of the Sculptor Group. NGC 625 is thought to have been involved in a collision and is experiencing a burst of active star formation. NGC 37 is a lenticular galaxy of apparent magnitude 14.66. It is approximately 42 kiloparsecs (137,000 light-years) in diameter and about 12.9 billion years old. Robert's Quartet (composed of the irregular galaxy NGC 87, and three spiral galaxies NGC 88, NGC 89 and NGC 92) is a group of four galaxies located around 160 million light-years away which <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of colliding and merging. They are within a circle of radius of 1.6 arcmin, corresponding to about 75,000 light-years. Located in the galaxy ESO 243-49 is HLX-1, an intermediate-mass black hole—the first one of its kind identified. It is thought to be a remnant of a dwarf galaxy that was absorbed in a collision with ESO 243-49. Before its discovery, this class of black hole was only hypothesized.|$|E
