2500|$|The Platz glider {{was built}} around a central, two part boom. A curved, {{circular}} cross-section steel tube reached from the nose {{at least as far}} aft as the welded sockets which received the ends of the main wing spars. A solid, circular section wood beam was inserted into this steel tube, extending it rearwards. The wing spars were also circular, solid and wooden, set with strong dihedral which took their tips to the height of the extreme nose so that the foreplanes, elevators or jibs could be attached between these three points. [...] Their inner trailing edges were directly controlled by the pilot, who sat over the central beam-wing spar joint. They were initially hinged together at their leading edges, but later the hinge point was moved rearwards towards the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> to reduce pilot load and separated only behind the hinge. [...] Since there were no ribs, the airfoil was determined by the airflow and the pilot, as for the sloop's jib. [...] The main wing, a [...] single surface stretched between the spars and the extreme tail, also had its camber determined by the airflow, like the mainsail of the sloop. [...] Both wing sheets were produced by sewing together narrow strips of material; the longitudinal joints between them are prominent in some back lit, better quality images.|$|E
2500|$|After the end {{of world}} War I some Caudron C.23s, a large trimotor night bomber, were {{modified}} to act as passenger aircraft, but the C.25 was the first aircraft Caudron had designed from the beginning to carry passengers. It was large, with a [...] span, so Caudron built in hinges to allow the wings to be folded for easier handling on the ground. The wings were rectangular in plan, mounted without stagger and fabric covered. It was a three bay biplane with unusually thin, wooden, parallel, vertical interplane struts, assisted by flying wires of thicker than usual gauge. [...] The engine mountings, two pairs of parallel struts, defined the inner bay. The outer pair of these struts were doubled since this was where the wing folded and so the ends of the wing either side of the fold retained their struts. [...] Four vertical cabane struts braced the centre of the upper wing from the upper fuselage. There were ailerons on both lower and lower planes, extending over more than half the span. These were not aerodynamically balanced in the usual way but were connected to each other by three vertical rods which halfway up were hinged to the trailing edge of a narrower and shorter horizontal surface which rotated about an axis well behind its <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre.</b> The wires from the cockpit operated these ancillary surfaces, which then moved the ailerons, just as the leading edge of a conventional balanced aileron, extending forward of the hinge, assists the pilot's input.|$|E
40|$|Independent {{numerical}} {{methods for}} obtaining the subsonic load distribution on a thin wing of arbitrary twist and camber {{have been developed}} at NPL, NLR (Netherlands) and BAC (Warton). The three methods have been studied jointly and their novel features have been reviewed critically. The best solutions by each method show excellent agreement for wings, at uniform incidence, having smooth leading and trailing edges. Spanwise loading, local <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centres,</b> lift, pitching moment, vortex drag and chordwise loadings are tabulated for circular and rectangular planforms, for a wing of constant chord with hyperbolic leading and trailing edges, and for a tapered sweptback wing. The convergence of the solutions is examined in detail with respect to separate parameters representing the numbers of spanwise integration points and spanwise and chordwise collocation points. The tapered sweptback planform is considered with different amounts and types of artificial central rounding, but the crucial problem of a central kink under lifting conditions remains a subject for research...|$|R
40|$|Summary. A brief {{review of}} oscillatory {{theories}} reveals {{that some of these}} suffer from a defect that has been corrected in the Algol programme now subject to critical examination. Its features in steady and lowfrequency subsonic flow are outlined, and extensive tabulated results are presented for seventeen planforms. The accuracy and convergence of solutions are studied in relation to arbitrary parameters repreauiitiiig chordwise and spanwise collocation positions, spanwise integration points and the essential central rounding of sweptback wings. Rectangular and other wings with streamwise symmetry, untapered and tapered sweptback wings, slender and curved-tipped wings show progressively slower convergence, and they are examined in respect of overall forces, spanwise loading, local <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centres,</b> central chordwise loading and oscillatory pitching derivatives. Some new general criteria are recommended for selecting the arbitrary parameters. Serious inaccuracy arising from the original defect is established, and hence the need to examine theories for general frequency. The residual errors in the Algol programme may stem from high or low aspect ratio demanding extra spanwise or chordwise terms, but the most elusive cause of collocation error in the standard solutions is found to be insufficient central rounding of highly sweptback wings.

50|$|The {{longitudinal}} {{static stability}} of an aircraft is significantly {{influenced by the}} distance (moment arm or lever arm) between the centre of gravity (c.g.) and the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> of the airplane. The c.g. is established by {{the design of the}} airplane and influenced by its loading, as by payload, passengers, etc. The <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> (a.c.) of the airplane can be located approximately by taking the algebraic sum of the plan-view areas fore and aft of the c.g. multiplied by their blended moment arms and divided by their areas, in a manner analogous to the method of locating the c.g. itself. In conventional aircraft, this point is aft of, but close to, the one-quarter-chord point of the wing. In unconventional aircraft, e.g. the Quickie, it is between the two wings because the aft wing is so large. The pitching moment at the a.c. is typically negative and constant.|$|E
50|$|A {{centrifugal}} {{twisting force}} is experienced by any asymmetrical spinning object. In the propeller it acts to twist the blades {{to a fine}} pitch. The <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> of pressure is therefore usually arranged to be slightly forward of its mechanical centreline, creating a twisting moment towards coarse pitch and counteracting the centrifugal moment. However in a high-speed dive the aerodynamic force can change significantly and the moments can become unbalanced.|$|E
50|$|However, so we don't get {{centre of}} gravity or <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> {{movements}} aft of the blade elastic axis (which can introduce undesirable aerodynamic and inertial couplings), then the tip must be configured with an area shift forward.

A specific proposal is made for quantification offinal understeer or oversteer.

Thus Nu is non-dimensional, is zero for a notiona 1 ji;lal neutral vehicle, positive forfnal understeer and negative forfinal oversteer. A typical value is 0. 150 (rear drive) or 0. 220 (front). The various design parameters that influence the understeer number are investigated, and equations are obtained and quantified, including centre of mass position, lateral load transfer distribution, longitudinal load transfer, traction, the components of aerodynamic forces and moments, the effect of non-free differentials {{and the effect of}} load increments.

40|$|Recent {{work on the}} {{aerodynamics}} of {{flapping flight}} reveals fundamental differences in the mechanisms of aerodynamic force generation between fixed and flapping wings. When fixed wings translate at high angles of attack, they periodically generate and shed leading and trailing edge vortices as reflected in their fluctuating aerodynamic force traces and associated flow visualization. In contrast, wings flapping at high angles of attack generate stable leading edge vorticity, which persists throughout {{the duration of the}} stroke and enhances mean aerodynamic forces. Here, we show that aerodynamic forces can be controlled by altering the trailing edge flexibility of a flapping wing. We used a dynamically scaled mechanical model of flapping flight (Re ≈ 2000) to measure the aerodynamic forces on flapping wings of variable flexural stiffness (EI). For low to medium angles of attack, as flexibility of the wing increases, its ability to generate aerodynamic forces decreases monotonically but its lift-to-drag ratios remain approximately constant. The instantaneous force traces reveal no major differences in the underlying modes of force generation for flexible and rigid wings, but the magnitude of force, the angle of net force vector and centre of pressure all vary systematically with wing flexibility. Even a rudimentary framework of wing veins is sufficient to restore the ability of flexible wings to generate forces at near-rigid values. Thus, the magnitude of force generation can be controlled by modulating the trailing edge flexibility and thereby controlling the magnitude of the leading edge vorticity. To characterize this, we have generated a detailed database of aerodynamic forces as a function of several variables including material properties, kinematics, <b>aerodynamic</b> forces and <b>centre</b> of pressure, which {{can also be used to}} help validate computational models of aeroelastic flapping wings. These experiments will also be useful for wing design for small robotic insects and, to a limited extent, in understanding the aerodynamics of flapping insect wings...|$|R

The horizontal tail has an area equal to 1/6 of the wing area. Sections of the vertical and horizontal tail are circular arc profiles defined identically to the profile of the wing. Forward of the 1.5 D body extension, the geometry of the AGARD-C model is identical to that of the AGARD-B.

50|$|The {{solution}} usually adopted is {{to provide}} large elevator and/or elevon surfaces on the wing trailing edge.

In a highly swept delta wing the distance between trailing edge and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> is larger so enlarged surfaces are not required.

A retractable undercarriage and side-by-side seating to optimise the instructional process were specified. The majority of two seat gliders have had tandem seating, with the student's seat over the centre of gravity (c.g.) so that its occupation would not affect the trim. Since both occupants of the Hi 24 sat ahead of the wing leading edge for good visibility, this was not an option and it was decided to employ a variable sweep wing, moving its <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> to the c.g., rather than shift the c.g. with movable weights.|$|E

They may also involve simplifying assumptions with a significant impact on their accuracy. This may result in unrealistic levels of performance being estimated at an early stage in a design, with consequent risk later in a program. The work described here demonstrates a novel approach for estimating the aerodynamic characteristics of both simple swept-tapered and cranked wings. This approach combines analysis methods with optimal Design of Experiments to generate simple algebraic functions, or response surface models, representing the outputs of a series of more detailed analyses. Proof of concept for the response surface model technique, and subsequently, optimal Design of Experiments is demonstrated for simple swept-tapered wings. The response surface modelling approach is subsequently demonstrated for wing planforms with up to four cranks. Application of the technique to cranked wings has required the development of an optimal Design of Experiments method capable of handling non-linear constraints and larger sample sets. Construction of the response surface models required the automation of geometry and analysis tools to cope with large numbers of sample configurations for each problem. The resulting response surface models have been implemented in conceptual design tools and spreadsheet-based performance methods, where they have replaced ‘equivalent ’ swept-tapered wing approximations, with their associated inaccuracies.

40|$|Summary. Leading-edge {{separation}} from fairly thin wings of moderate or low aspect ratio {{gives rise to}} aerodynamic loading and forces that are non-linear with incidence. It {{is important to be}} able to estimate these effects theoretically for wings of arbitrary planform. A simplified mathematical vortex model has been devised by Gersten for wings in steady incompressible flow. This model in conjunction with Multhopp's linear liftingsurface theory provides the basis of the present method. The investigation covers a variety of planforms, and each type serves to illustrate different facets of non-linear theory and its numerical application. Many comparisons between the calculated results and wind-tunnel measurements are used in a critical appraisal of the method. When there are leading-edge vortices or extensive regions of separated flow, the calculated total lift and pitching moment give a decisive improvement on linear theory. Analysis shows a simple correlation between the centre of non-linear lift and the linear <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre.</b> The spanwise distributions of lift and local centre of pressure on rectangular wings are well predicted, but the calculated loading on swept wings appears to be unrealistic. An alternative treatment of the mathematical model on the basis of slender-wing theory illustrates some defects of the method in its present form. It might be developed to simulate the rolling-up of vortex sheet...|$|E
40|$|Summary. -Results {{are given}} of {{pressure}} measurements and boundary-layer traverses on a two-dimensional wing with 10 per cent RAE 101 section at Reynolds numbers of 1 · 6 X 106 and 3 · 2 X 106 • These results, {{which have been}} integrated to give lift, drag and aerodynamic-centre characteristics, are used to check some calculation methods {{for the growth of}} the turbulent boundary layer and for the effect of a known boundary layer on the pressure distribution. It is concluded that the calculation of the boundary layer still needs a little refinement before it is accurate enough to predict viscosity effects on pressure distribution, lift, drag and aerodynamic centre; but that these effects can be calculated if the actual boundary-layer characteristics are known. 1. Introduction. -This note is a further contribution to the study of viscous flow about a two-dimensional aerofoil. The effect of viscosity is not only to produce a drag force due to the shear stresses on the aerofoil surface-skin friction-but also to modify the pressure distribution over the aerofoil. This brings about a reduction in lift, a change in the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre,</b> and another drag force, the form drag. Primarily the viscosity ensures that the flow leaves th...|$|E
40|$|Summary. -Tests {{were made}} at a Reynolds number of 1 · 8 X 106 and Mach numbers up to 0 · 93. The wing tip was cropped to a taper of 1 / 7 and the wing section was RAE 102, symmetrical, 10 per cent thickness/chord at 35 per cent chord. Form drag is highly {{localised}} near the root at low speed. Above M = 0, 88, rearward movement of the strong shock causes a rapid rise of drag at all sections. Spanwise loading at low incidence is close to potential theory for wing without body up to M = 0 · 9. A tip stall occurs at M ~ 0 · 9 for lX = 3 · 65 deg and at M ~ 0 · 8 for lX = 7 · 7 deg, and causes a nose-down moment. Overall lift slope at low CL's increases to a maximum at about M = 0 · 89, then falls off with signs of a recovery at M = 0 · 92. Local aerodynamic centres at low CL agree with potential theory for wing alone at low speeds, but move backwards beyond M = O· 8. The overall <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>centre</b> for the wing moves back about 10 per cent mean chord by M = 0 · 92. There is a loss of elevon power for angles up to- 5 deg above M = 0 ' 92, as found on a complete model at lower Reynolds number...|$|E
