It is associated to <b>arterial</b> <b>abnormalities</b> (absence of the brachiocephalic trunk and arteria lusoria) that can be identified by ultrasonography. The aim {{of the study was to}} verify the usefulness of preoperative ultrasonography in the research of nonrecurrent ILN by the means of identification of <b>arterial</b> <b>abnormalities</b> and the impact on ILN morbidity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 750 patients who underwent neck surgery with right-side ILN dissection. A preoperative ultrasonography aimed to identify <b>arterial</b> <b>abnormalities</b> associated to nonrecurrent ILN was performed in 400 patients (Group A) while no preoperative attempts were performed in the remaining patients (Group B). Patients' characteristics, time for intraoperative identification of the ILN, and morbidity were compared. RESULTS: Five and four nonrecurrent ILN were identified in groups A and B, respectively (p = NS). Preoperative ultrasonography correctly predicted nonrecurrent ILN in all cases (accuracy 100 %). Nonrecurrent ILN palsy never occurred in group A, while three cases occurred in group B (p < 0. 05). The mean time for intraoperative identification of both nonrecurrent and normally recurrent ILN was significantly shorter in group A (p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative ultrasonography can correctly identify nonrecurrent ILN, allowing earlier nerve identification and prevention of injuries...|$|R

These aneurysms are fragile, apt to rupture, and difficult to diagnose preoperatively. Though local factors such as jet streams and bacterial endocarditis may influence their formation there must be an underlying generalised weakness in the arterial wall.

40|$|Many {{victims of}} the sudden infant death {{syndrome}} (SIDS) have abnormally heavy cardiac right ventricles. The degree of this abnormality is directly proportional to: a) the mass of muscle about small pulmonary arteries, b) the amount of brown fat retention about adrenal glands, and c) the presence of hepatic erythropoiesis. The pulmonary <b>arterial</b> <b>abnormality</b> is probably the result of chronic alveolar hypoventilation, while brown fat retention and hepatic erythropoiesis are likely consequences of chronic hypoxemia. These abnormalities are found in both SIDS victims who die with and those who die without mild respiratory tract infections. However, there are some differences between the two SIDS groups.

40|$|Background and Purpose-Contrast {{angiography}} (CA) is {{the reference}} examination for {{the diagnosis of}} cerebral <b>arterial</b> <b>abnormality,</b> but this procedure is invasive. In childhood, ischemic strokes are being increasingly investigated by means of MRI, including MR angiography (MRA). Very few data are available about the accuracy of MRA compared with CA {{in the specific context}} of acute pediatric stroke. We sought to compare the results of MRA with those of CA for the study of cerebral arteries in children with arterial infarction in an arterial distribution. Methods-Twenty-four children presenting with 26 infarcts were studied. All were examined with cerebral MRI and MRA and with CA. The interval between CA and MRA was < 3 days for most of the patients. Results-Arterial lesions were detected in all but 2 children. They were located in the major cerebral arteries, predominantly in the anterior circulation (85 % of cases). All lesions shown by CA were present on MRA (19 cases). Patients with no lesion on MRA had normal CA (2 cases). Associated distal vascular lesions and degree of arterial stenosis were more accurately detected with CA.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{characterize}} the anatomy of vertebral arteries using magnetic resonance imaging scans of 250 consecutive patients. OBJECTIVES: To document the prevalence of midline vertebral artery (VA) migration in a subgroup of patients presenting with neck pain, radiculopathy, or myelopathy and to identify the course of the VA through the TFs. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Knowledge of VA anomalies and their respective prevalence may help surgeons decrease the incidence of iatrogenic injury to this artery. METHODS: In this retrospective review of 281 consecutive patients, who had an magnetic resonance imaging for axial neck pain, radiculopathy, or myelopathy, anatomic measurements were obtained from C 2 to C 7. RESULTS: The observed VA anomalies can be classified into following 3 main groups: (1) intraforaminal anomalies-midline migration, (2) extraforaminal anomalies, and (3) arterial anomalies. Midline migration of the VA was identified in 7. 6 % (19 / 250) of patients. The etiology can be degenerative or traumatic. It is important to note that the pattern of medial migration was clockwise rotation from caudal to cephalad and was present in all of our patients with anomalous arteries. Additionally, at C 6, only 92 % (460 / 500) of VAs were located within their respective transverse foramens and hypoplastic VAs were identified in 10 % (25 / 250) of patients. CONCLUSION: Anomalies that must be considered before surgery include interforamenal anomalies, extraforamenal anomalies, and arterial anomalies. The intraforaminal anomalies involve midline migration, which places the VA at direct risk during corpectomy. Extraforaminal anomalies are related to VAs entering the transverse foramen at a level other than C 6, which can increase the risk of injury during the anterior approach to the cervical spine. Arterial anomalies can be fenestrated, hypoplastic, or absent. These raise concern with the ability to maintain cerebral perfusion in the setting of damage to one of the VAs with the presence of contralateral <b>arterial</b> <b>abnormality...</b>|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveIn {{the absence}} of ischemic events, {{arterial}} pathology at the thoracic outlet (TO) is rarely identified because findings of chronic arterial pathology may be masked by symptoms of neurogenic compression. This study describes the clinical presentations and significance of arterial compression at the TO. MethodsThis was a retrospective analysis of the clinical records and imaging studies of 41 patients with objective findings of arterial compression at the TO. Sixteen were diagnosed from 1990 to 2003, during which 284 patients underwent surgery for TO decompression with selective arterial imaging; 25 were diagnosed from 2003 to 2009, and 62 underwent TO surgical decompressions. ResultsSubclavian artery stenosis, with or without poststenotic dilatation (PSD), was found in 26 patients (63 %), subclavian artery aneurysms in 12 (29 %), chronic subclavian occlusion in 1 (2. 4 %), and axillary artery compression in 2 (5 %). Chronic symptoms difficult to discern from neurogenic compression were present in 27 patients (66 %; 24 had subclavian stenoses or PSD, or both, 1 had subclavian occlusion, and 2 had axillary artery compression); 13 (32 %) presented with acute ischemia (11 had aneurysms and 2 had PSDs), and 1 asymptomatic patient had a subclavian aneurysm. Osteoarticular anomalies were found in 27 patients (66 %), including 19 cervical ribs, 4 first rib anomalies, and 4 clavicular or first rib fractures, or both. Among 27 patients with subclavian aneurysms or PSD, 21 (78 %) had a bone anomaly. Arterial pathology was deemed significant in 30 patients (73 %) and mild or moderate in 11 (21 %). Symptoms in 23 of these patients were compatible with neurogenic compression without clinical suspicion of arterial pathology, but 13 (56 %) harbored a significant arterial anomaly. ConclusionsThe incidence of arterial pathology secondary to compression at the TO may be underestimated, and in {{the absence of}} obvious ischemia, significant arterial pathology may not be suspected. Two-thirds of patients with arterial compression have associated bone anomalies. Therefore, routine arterial imaging seems advisable for patients evaluated for TO syndrome in the presence of a bone anomaly at the TO or an examination that shows an <b>arterial</b> <b>abnormality.</b> In the absence of these signs, however, arterial pathology may be overlooked in patients with symptoms suggestive of neurogenic compression. Further study is needed to elucidate the incidence, natural history, and clinical relevance of arterial compression and PSD at the TO...|$|E

Our aim was to perform 1 -year MR angiographic and clinical follow-up of patients treated with mechanical endovascular thrombectomy using the Solitaire device. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with stroke treated between August 2010 and July 2012 were prospectively evaluated with a minimum follow-up of 1 year after mechanical endovascular thrombectomy. Angiographic follow-up was performed on a 3 T MR imaging scanner and included intracranial artery TOF MRA and supra-aortic artery gadolinium-enhanced MRA. Images were assessed to detect <b>arterial</b> <b>abnormalities</b> (stenosis, occlusion, dilation) and were compared with the final post-mechanical endovascular thrombectomy run to differentiate delayed and pre-existing abnormalities. Clinical evaluation was performed with the mRS and the 36 -Item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire quality-of-life scale. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were angiographically assessed at the mean term of 19 Â± 4 months. MRA showed intracranial artery abnormalities in 10 patients, including 5 delayed intracranial artery abnormalities in 4 patients (4 stenoses and 1 dilation), 4 cases of pre-existing intracranial artery stenosis, and 2 occlusions. Pre-existing etiologic cervical artery stenosis or occlusion was observed in 2 patients. All these patients remained asymptomatic during the follow-up period. A significant clinical improvement was observed at 1 -year follow-up in comparison with 3 -month follow-up (P <. 0001), with a good outcome achieved in 62. 5 % of patients and an acceptable quality of life restored.

With obstructive lesions, intense neointimal Tn expression co-localized with EGF and PCNA. Fn accumulation in the periendothelium increased with medial hypertrophy and became more widespread in a diffuse pattern with neointimal formation. The neointima was predominantly composed of alpha-smooth-muscle-actin-positive cells, occasional inflammatory cells with no evidence of apoptosis.

40|$|Arteriopathies are the commonest {{cause of}} {{arterial}} ischaemic stroke (AIS) in children. Repeated vascular imaging {{in children with}} AIS demonstrated {{the existence of a}} â€˜transient cerebral arteriopathyâ€™ (TCA), characterized by lenticulostriate infarction due to non-progressive unilateral arterial disease affecting the supraclinoid internal carotid artery and its proximal branches. To further characterize the course of childhood arteriopathies, and to differentiate TCA from progressive arterial disease, we studied the long-term evolution of unilateral anterior circulation arteriopathy, and explored predictors of stroke outcome and recurrence. From three consecutive cohorts in London, Paris and Utrecht, we reviewed radiological studies and clinical charts of 79 previously healthy children with anterior circulation AIS and unilateral intracranial arteriopathy of the internal carotid bifurcation, who underwent repeated vascular imaging. The long-term evolution of arteriopathy was classified as progressive or TCA. Clinical and imaging characteristics were compared between both groups. Logistic regression modelling was used to determine possible predictors of the course of arteriopathy, functional outcome and recurrence. After a median follow-up of 1. 4 years, 5 of 79 children (6 %) had progressive arteriopathy, with increasing unilateral disease or bilateral involvement. In the others (94 %), the course of arteriopathy was classified as TCA. In 23 % of TCA patients, follow-up vascular imaging showed complete normalization, the remaining 77 % had residual <b>arterial</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> with improvement in 45 % and stabilization in 32 %. Stroke was preceded by chickenpox in 44 % of TCA patients, and in none of the patients with progressive arteriopathies. Most infarcts were localized in the basal ganglia. In 14 (19 %) of TCA patients, transient worsening of the arterial lesion was demonstrated before the arteriopathy stabilized or improved. Thirteen TCA patients (18 %) had a recurrent stroke or TIA. Thirty TCA patients (41 %) had a good neurological outcome, compared with none of the five patients with progressive arteriopathy. Arterial occlusion, moyamoya vessels and ACA involvement were more frequent in progressive arteriopathies. Cortical infarct localization was significantly associated with poor neurological outcome (OR 6. 14, 95 % CI 1. 29 â€“ 29. 22, P = 0. 02), while there was a trend for occlusive arterial disease to predict poor outcome (OR 3. 00, 95 % CI 0. 98 â€“ 9. 23, P = 0. 06). Progressive arteriopathy was associated with recurrence (OR 18. 77, 95 %CI 1. 94 â€“ 181. 97, P = 0. 01).

Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity has been proposed as {{the gold standard for}} arterial stiffness measurement and is a well recognized predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcome. Systolic BP and pulse pressure in the ascending aorta may be lower than pressures measured in the upper limb, especially in young individuals. A number of studies suggest closer correlation of end-organ damage with central BP than with peripheral BP, and central BP may provide additional prognostic information regarding cardiovascular risk. Moreover, BP-lowering drugs can have differential effects on central aortic pressures and hemodynamics compared with brachial BP. This may explain the greater beneficial effect provided by newer antihypertensive drugs beyond peripheral BP reduction. Although many methodological problems still hinder the wide clinical application of parameters of arterial stiffness, these will likely contribute to cardiovascular assessment and management in future clinical practice. Each of the abovementioned parameters reflects a different characteristic of the atherosclerotic process, involving functional and/or morphological changes in the vessel wall. Therefore, acquiring simultaneous measurements of different parameters of vascular function and structure could theoretically enhance the power to improve risk stratification. Continuous technological effort is necessary to refine our methods of investigation in order to detect early <b>arterial</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> <b>Arterial</b> stiffness and its consequences represent the great challenge of the twenty-first century for affluent countries, and "de-stiffening" will be the goal of the next decades...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{association}} of cortical organization disorders with facial hemangi-omas or vascular malformations {{has been described}} {{in only a few}} reports. The {{purpose of this study was}} to show the close {{association of}} these cutaneous anomalies with cortical dysplasias and intracranial vascular abnormalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five patients, all women, with cutaneous vascular abnormalities, 4 with hemangioma and 1 with vascular malformation, were studied with MR and MR angiography. RESULTS: All 5 of the patients showed cortical dysplasia. The cutaneous lesions involved the left frontal region, ipsilateral to the cerebral hemisphere with cortical dysplasia, in all of the patients. Four patients had seizures that responded well to antiepileptic drugs. Hemispheric hypoplasia was associ-ated with the cortical dysplasia in all 5 of the patients. <b>Arterial</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were found in all of the patients, consisting of aplasia of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery in 2, persistence of the trigeminal artery in 2, persistence of both proatlantal arteries and double kinking in the internal carotid artery in 1, and origin of both anterior cerebral arteries from the same internal carotid in all 5 of the patients, 1 of whom also showed an intracavernous anterior cerebral artery origin of the same side of the hemispheric hypoplasia and polymicrogyria. Seizures and mild psychomotor delay could be caused b...|$|R
40|$|Homocysteine is a {{risk factor}} for the {{development}} of atherosclerosis and its thrombotic complications. We have employed an animal model to explore the hypothesis that an increase in reactive oxygen species and a subsequent loss of nitric oxide bioactivity contribute to endothelial dysfunction in mild hyperhomocysteinemia. We examined endothelial function and in vivo oxidant burden in mice heterozygous for a deletion in the cystathionine Î²-synthase (CBS) gene, by studying isolated, precontracted aortic rings and mesenteric arterioles in situ. CBSâ€“/+ mice demonstrated impaired acetylcholine-induced aortic relaxation and a paradoxical vasoconstriction of mesenteric microvessels in response to superfusion of methacholine and bradykinin. Cyclic GMP accumulation following acetylcholine treatment was also impaired in isolated aortic segments from CBSâ€“/+ mice, but aortic relaxation and mesenteric arteriolar dilation in response to sodium nitroprusside were similar to wild-type. Plasma levels of 8 -epi-PGF 2 Î± (8 -IP) were somewhat increased in CBSâ€“/+ mice, but liver levels of 8 -IP and phospholipid hydroperoxides, another marker of oxidative stress, were normal. Aortic tissue from CBSâ€“/+ mice also demonstrated greater superoxide production and greater immunostaining for 3 -nitrotyrosine, particularly on the endothelial surface. Importantly, endothelial dysfunction appears early in CBSâ€“/+ mice in the absence of structural <b>arterial</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> Hence, mild hyperhomocysteinemia due to reduced CBS expression impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation, likely due to impaired nitric oxide bioactivity, and increased oxidative stress apparently contributes to inactivating nitric oxide in chronic, mild hyperhomocysteinemia...|$|R
40|$|Duplex-Doppler study {{typically}} exhibits triphasic {{brachial artery}} blood flow velocity pattern in subjects classified as normal without clinically evident atherosclerotic complications, heart disease, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus. In this study, the authors described the late systolic wave on the brachial artery blood flow velocity pattern {{in patients with}} coronary artery disease and investigated the relation between late systolic wave and vascular stiffness. Blood flow profile and velocity of the brachial artery were determined noninvasively by ultrasound pulsed-Doppler technique {{under the guidance of}} a B-mode ultrasound image in 96 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The control group consisted of 23 healthy subjects with no or maximally 2 risk factors (only among age, cigarette smoking, obesity, and gender) for vascular disease. None of the patients and controls had clinical evidence of arterial disorders at upper extremities. In 32 patients (33 %) with CAD, a late systolic wave was observed in the brachial artery Doppler study. On the other hand, no late systolic wave was observed in the healthy subjects. In addition, multivessel disease, hypertension, advanced age, diabetes, and smoking were significantly more frequent in patients with the late systolic wave. In conclusion, peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>abnormalities</b> induced by vascular stiffness may produce alterations in regional wave reflections, and the normal triphasic pattern of the brachial artery blood flow may change by the appearance of the late systolic wave...|$|R
40|$|It is {{now clear}} that hepatopulmonary {{syndrome}} (HPS) may occur and contribute significantly to gas exchange abnormalities in the setting of other cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Since there is no gold-standard diagnostic test for HPS, diagnosis rests on documenting <b>arterial</b> oxygenation <b>abnormalities</b> resulting from intrapulmonary vasodilatation in the setting of liver disease. Retrospective studies suggest that many patients with HPS develop progressive intrapulmonary vasodilatation over time and that mortality is significant. This case highlights the clinical value in investigating for HPS and right-to-left shunts when confronted with a patient presenting with unexplained hypoxia in combination with platypnoea and/or orthodeoxia.
