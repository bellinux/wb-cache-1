5|$|The Moon's orbit intersects {{with the}} {{ecliptic}} {{at the two}} nodes that are 180 degrees apart. Therefore, the new moon occurs close to the nodes at two periods of the year approximately six months (173.3 days) apart, known as eclipse seasons, and there will <b>always</b> <b>be</b> at least one solar eclipse during these periods. Sometimes the new moon occurs close enough to a node during two consecutive months to eclipse the Sun on both occasions in two partial eclipses. This means that, in any given year, there will <b>always</b> <b>be</b> at least two solar eclipses, and there can {{be as many as}} five.|$|E

5|$|Bike {{maneuverability}} {{and handling}} {{is difficult to}} quantify for several reasons. The geometry of a bike, especially the steering axis angle makes kinematic analysis complicated.

Bike designs tend to consist of a trade-off between maneuverability and stability.|$|E
