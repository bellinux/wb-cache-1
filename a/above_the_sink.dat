50|$|To easily {{understand}} the concept of an isolation valve, one can think of the valves under a kitchen or bathroom sink in a typical household. These valves are normally left open so that the user can control the flow of water with the spigot <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink,</b> and does not need to reach under the counter to start or stop the water flow. However, if the spigot needs to be replaced (i.e. maintenance needs to take place on the system), the isolation valves are shut to stop the flow of water when the spigot is removed. In this system, the isolation valves and the spigot may even be the same type of valve. However, due to their function they are classified as the isolation valves and, {{in the case of the}} spigot, the control valves.|$|E

40|$|The steady {{withdrawal}} of an inviscid fluid of finite depth into a line sink is {{considered for the}} case in which surface tension is acting on the free surface. The problem is solved numerically by use of a boundary-integral-equation method. It is shown that the flow depends on the Froude number, F B=m(gH 3 B) – 1 / 2, and the nondimensional sink depth =H S/H B, where m is the sink strength, g the acceleration of gravity, H B is the total depth upstream, H S is {{the height of the}} sink, and on the surface tension, T.

40|$|The coupled {{phenomena}} of momentum, heat, and mass transfer were simulated {{in order to}} predict and {{to better understand the}} generation and movement of intermetallic dross particles within certain regions of a typical galvanizing bath. Solutions for the temperature and aluminum concentration can be correlated with the solubility limits of aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) to determine the amount of precipitated aluminum in the form of Fe 2 Al 5 top dross. Software developed by the Industrial Materials Institute of the National Research Council of Canada (IMI-NRC), including k- 3 ̆b 5 turbulence modeling for heat and mass transfer, was adapted for the simulation of a sequence of operating parameters. Each case was modeled over a period of 1 hour, taking into account an ingot-melting period followed by a nonmelting period. The presence of an ingot significantly changes the temperature distribution and also results in important variations in the local aluminum concentration, since the makeup ingot has a higher aluminum concentration. The simulation showed that during the ingot melting, the total aluminum concentration is higher at the ingot side of the bath than at the strip exit side. The region below the ingot presents the highest aluminum concentration, whereas lower aluminum concentrations were found in the region <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> roll, between the strip and the free surface. It was shown that precipitates form near the ingot surface because this region is surrounded by a solution at 420 0 C, which is lower than the average bath temperature of 460 0 C. When no ingot is present, the total aluminum concentration becomes much more uniform and decreases with time at a constant rate, depending on the coating thickness. This information is of major significance in the prediction of the formation of dross particles, which can cause defects on the coated product. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

2500|$|Stratovolcanoes are {{a common}} feature of {{subduction}} zones. The magma that forms them arises when water, which is trapped both in hydrated minerals and in the porous basalt rock of the upper oceanic crust, is released into mantle rock of <b>the</b> asthenosphere <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>sinking</b> oceanic slab. <b>The</b> release of water from hydrated minerals is termed [...] "dewatering", and occurs at specific pressure/temperature conditions for specific minerals as the plate subducts to lower depths. The water freed from the subducting slab lowers the melting point of the overlying mantle rock, which then undergoes partial melting and rises due to its density relative to the surrounding mantle rock, and pools temporarily {{at the base of}} the lithosphere. The magma then rises through the crust, incorporating silica rich crustal rock, leading to a final intermediate composition. When the magma nears the surface it pools in a magma chamber under the volcano. The relatively low pressure of the magma allows water and other volatiles (CO2, S2−, Cl−) dissolved in the magma to begin to come out of solution, much like when a bottle of carbonated water is opened. Once a critical volume of magma and gas accumulates, the obstacle provided by the volcanic cone is overcome, leading to a sudden explosive eruption.|$|R

40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the Faculty of Arts, University of the Witwatersrand, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts, Clinical Psychology. Johannesburg December 1989 Bulimia, the syndrome characterised by a pattern of episodic binge eating followed by attempts to purge the food by vomiting or laxative abuse, was only identified as a distinct syndrome in the late 1970 s. The first studies to record these symptoms focused on bulimia as an associated feature or subtype of anorexia nervosa. In subsequent research however, it became evident that binge-eating and purging behaviour also occurs in normal weight people. It is this group of 'normal weight bulimics' who {{are the focus of}} this study. The present study focuses on the mother-daughter relationship, hypothesizing that this rulncionship will be of some significance in the etiology and maintenance of the syndrome (this {{has been shown to be}} the case in anorexia nervosa). There has been very little research in this area and available information is based on clinical material from individual case studies. Two groups of women were selected, a bulimic and a non-bulimic group, and their perceptions of their mothers compared. The subjects were given a short demographic questionnaire, a projective test (the Thematic Apperception Test) which is sensitive to issues pertaining to the mother-daughter relationship, and an open ended question eliciting a description of their mothers. The data was analysed by two independent clinicians, using Beliak's (1986) method, and significant trends in the mother-daughter relationship were identified. The findings confirmed the significance of the mother-daughter relationship. The results were divided into two categories: the daughter's perceptions of her mother, and the daughter's feelings and responses. The major findings were, firstly, that the bulimic daughters feel emotionally deprived, and secondly, that the bulimic daughters feel extremely angry with their mothers but are afraid of expressing this anger directly. Instead they tend to become passive, and to withdraw into revengeful fantasies or to resort to passive aggressive behaviour. The present research brings to light a number of issues related to the mother-daughter relationship and the relationships in the 'bulimic family' as a whole, which require further investigation. "The woman is consoling the girl. But the girl feels the need to be alone. She can't accept love from others readily because she is scared. Scared that one day it will be removed, taken away or that it will turn to hate. She feels alone. Deep inside there is a need for consolation but she hides this insecurity with an invisible shield. " (Bulimic subject's response to one of the TAT cards). "She knew what she had to do before it was too late, and she rose up with difficulty and walked across the thick carpet to the bathroom, and flicked on the light.

2500|$|Trout tend {{mostly to}} feed underwater. When fishing deeper waters such as rivers or lakes, putting a fly {{down to the}} trout may be more {{successful}} than fishing on the surface, especially {{in the absence of}} any surface insect activity or hatch. The nymph itself can be weighted, as is the popular bead headed hare's ear nymph or bead headed pheasant tail nymph. Alternatively, the angler can use an attractor pattern such as a prince nymph. Weights can be added to the leader. Probably the best weight to use is twist on lead or other metal strips because it has a much less detrimental effect on the casting ability. A sinking tip fly line can also serve to <b>sink</b> <b>the</b> fly. A common nymphing and general overall fly fishing technique that even beginners can master is a [...] "dead drift" [...] or tight line fishing technique, casting directly across the river, letting the fly line drift downriver while keeping any slack out of the line. If the Nymph is drifting too fast, then you should perform an upstream mend. If the nymph is drifting too slowly, you should mend downstream. A beginner need simply to point the rod at the fly, lifting the rod in the event of a strike. This is a [...] "downstream technique" [...] where the angler moves in a downstream direction.

40|$|More {{than twenty}} seismic lines were {{analysed}} across {{the intersection of}} the Taiwan orogen and the Ryukyu arc-forearc system. The main results of this study concern the recognition of two superposed sedimentary basins that were previously unknown. We have named the recent one the Hoping Basin and the older, tectonized one the Suao Basin. The Suao Basin, containing sediments more than 3 km thick, records subsidence of about 3 km on its southwestern portion after being shortened in the direction of plate convergence. On the basis of seismicity, gravity, present-day plate kinematics as well as seismic reflection data, we relate the dramatic subsidence of the Suao Basin to the initiation of a WNW-trending tear fault within the Philippine Sea plate. This tear fault decouples the subducting Philippine Sea plate to the northeast and the apparent overthrusting Philippine Sea plate in the Coastal Range to the southwest. Back-arc rifting may thus occur in the westernmost ection of <b>the</b> Okinawa trough <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>sinking</b> Philippine Sea slab while lithospheric shortening prevails south of Hualien. As a consequence, the triangular area located southwest of the tear fault, between the Taiwan coastline and the toe of the Yaeyama ridge, no longer belongs to the Ryukyu forearc. It is now passively transported with the non-subducting portion of the Philippine Sea plate.
