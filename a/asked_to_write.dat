5|$|In 1972, Ochs was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> {{the theme}} song for the film Kansas City Bomber. The task proved difficult, as Ochs {{struggled}} to overcome his writer's block. Although his song was not used in the soundtrack, it was released as a single.|$|E
5|$|That autumn Hogg {{visited the}} couple in Edinburgh, which he greatly enjoyed. Hogg soon became very {{attracted}} to Harriet, and often spent time alone with her whenever Percy <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> in solitude.

5|$|Von Neumann was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> {{an essay}} for the layman {{describing}} what mathematics is, {{and produced a}} beautiful analysis. He explained that mathematics straddles the world between the empirical and logical, arguing that geometry was originally empirical, but Euclid constructed a logical, deductive theory. However, he argued, that {{there is always the}} danger of straying too far from the real world and becoming irrelevant sophistry.|$|E
5|$|Geisel {{created the}} book in {{response}} to a debate in the United States about literacy in early childhood and the ineffectiveness of traditional primers such as those featuring Dick and Jane. Geisel was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a more entertaining primer by William Spaulding, whom he had met during World War II and who was then director of the education division at Houghton Mifflin. However, because Geisel was already under contract with Random House, the two publishers agreed to a deal: Houghton Mifflin published the education edition, which was sold to schools, and Random House published the trade edition, which was sold in bookstores.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> {{a series}} called Riverboat, set in 1860s Mississippi. When he {{discovered}} that the producers wanted no black people on the show, he argued so much with them that he lost the job. He also considered moving to England around this time, as Sir Lew Grade of Associated Television wanted Roddenberry to develop series and set up his own production company. Though he did not move, he leveraged the deal to land a contract with Screen Gems that included a guaranteed $100,000, and became a producer {{for the first time}} on a summer replacement for the Tennessee Ernie Ford Show titled Wrangler.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} brought in to be a low-budget {{replacement}} for a script by Stephen Fry that had been pushed back, and was filmed mainly in the Tremorfa area of Cardiff at a housing estate. Graham was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> an episode primarily for children which would soften the much darker finale that would be broadcast after. The episode was watched by 7.14 million viewers in the UK, and was given an Appreciation Index of 83. Though Graham received letters from children who enjoyed the episode, it did not generate a positive response from adult fans and critics.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{what was}} to become Ruma Maida began in 2008, when Utami was {{approached}} by Lamp Pictures and <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a nationalism-themed script; she completed the task in six months, with input from Soeriaatmadja. After three months of pre-production, shooting began in Semarang, Central Java, and Kota, Jakarta. Editing took three months, after which the film– with a soundtrack by the band Naif and a song written by Utami– premiered on 28 October 2009, the anniversary of the 1928 Youth Pledge; it was later shown in film festivals in Singapore, Australia, and Italy.|$|E
5|$|After her release, Sarumpaet {{continued}} {{to participate in}} pro-democracy movements; these actions led to her fleeing Indonesia after hearing rumours {{that she would be}} arrested for dissent. When she returned to Indonesia, Sarumpaet {{continued to}} write politically charged stageplays. She became head of the Jakarta Art Board in 2003; two years later she was approached by UNICEF and <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a drama to raise awareness of child trafficking in Southeast Asia. The resulting work served as the foundation for her 2009 feature film debut, Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President). This film was submitted to the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film but not nominated. The following year, she released her first novel, Maluku, Kobaran Cintaku (Maluku, Flame of My Love).|$|E

5|$|In {{seeking to}} {{discipline}} the nuns, the Vatican did not contact {{any one of}} them personally, and did not respond to direct individual communication. Rather, the superiors of the nuns were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> letters verifying whether or not the nuns were in line with Catholic teaching on abortion, and a variety of responses were received from the superiors. A few nuns disavowed their position on abortion and the cases were quickly closed. Most nuns held to their earlier conviction, although their superiors sent letters saying that they accepted Church teaching. Once a nun's superior had {{sent a letter to the}} Vatican, the case was closed, without any further attempt to prevent the nun from speaking out on the issues.|$|E
5|$|The {{critical}} and commercial {{success of the}} film of David Copperfield led to an invitation to return to Hollywood in 1936. When he got there {{he found that the}} studio executives had no idea which films they wanted him to work on, and he had eight weeks of highly paid leisure, during which he wrote a short story and worked on a novel. He was eventually <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the scenario for Little Lord Fauntleroy, which he enjoyed doing. He spent most of his fees on paintings, forgetting to keep enough money to pay US tax on his earnings. He replenished his American funds with a lecture tour – his last – in late 1936.|$|E
5|$|The {{language}} spoken {{during this period}} {{is thought to be}} Southwestern Brythonic, but only one or two inscribed stones survive in Somerset from this period. However, a couple of curse tablets found in the baths at Bath may be in this language. Some place names in Somerset seem to be Celtic in origin and may be from this period or earlier, e.g. Tarnock. Some river names, such as Parrett, may be Celtic or pre-Celtic. The religion of the people of Somerset in this period is thought to be Christian but it was isolated from Rome until after the Council of Hertford in 673AD when Aldhelm was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a letter to Geraint of Dumnonia and his bishops. Some church sites in Somerset are thought to date from this period, e.g., Llantokay Street.|$|E

5|$|The soundtrack to Nier {{is largely}} {{composed}} of melancholy acoustic pieces which heavily feature vocals by vocalist Emi Evans (Emiko Rebecca Evans), a singer from England living in Tokyo. She is the singer {{for the band}} freesscape, and had previously worked on video games such as Etrian Odyssey. In addition to singing, Evans was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> her own lyrics in futuristic languages. The composers gave her preliminary version of songs and the style they wished the language to be in, such as Gaelic or French, and she invented the words. Evans wrote songs in versions of Gaelic, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English and Japanese, where she {{tried to imagine what}} they would sound like after 1000 years of drifting.|$|E
