50|$|As {{described}} above, host cells phosphorylate nucleoside analogs to nucleotide analogs. The latter {{serve as}} poison building blocks (chain terminators) for both viral and host DNA, causing respectively the desired <b>antiviral</b> <b>effect</b> and drug toxicity/side effects. Taking phosphonatenucleotide analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NtARTIs or NtRTIs) directly obviates the initial phosphorylation step, but host enzymes must still phosphorylate the phosphonate nucleotide analogue to the phosphonate-diphosphate state for anti-viral activity. These molecules were first synthesized by Antonin Holy at the Czech Academy of Sciences, and commercialized by GILEAD.|$|E
50|$|High {{dietary intake}} of green tea (specifically, catechins and theanine that {{is found in}} tea products) has been {{correlated}} with reduced risk of contracting influenza, as well as having an <b>antiviral</b> <b>effect</b> upon types A and B. Specifically, {{the high levels of}} epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechin gallate, and epigallocatechin present in green tea were found to inhibit influenza virus replication. Additionally, topical application has been suggested to possibly act as a mild disinfectant. Regular dietary intake of green tea has been associated with stronger immune response to infection, through the enhancement of T-Cell function.|$|E
50|$|The deamination {{activity}} ultimately {{results in}} G→A hypermutations at “hot spots” of the proviral DNA. Such hypermutation ultimately destroys the coding and replicative {{capacity of the}} virus, resulting in many nonviable virions. APOBEC3G has a much weaker <b>antiviral</b> <b>effect</b> when its active site has been mutated {{to the point that}} the protein can no longer mutate retroviral DNA. It was originally thought that the APOBEC3G-mediated deamination can also indirectly lead to viral DNA degradation by DNA repair systems attracted to the mutated residues. However, this has been discounted because human APOBEC3G reduces viral cDNA levels independently of DNA repair enzymes UNG and SMUG1.|$|E
40|$|The {{methyl ester}} of {{amphotericin}} B (AME) is water soluble, retains antifungal activity, and is significantly less toxic in mammals than amphotericin B. In contrast to amphotericin B, {{which is not}} water soluble, AME exhibits <b>antiviral</b> <b>effects</b> against vesicular stomatitis virus, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, Sindbis virus, and vaccinia virus in a plaque reduction assay. No <b>antiviral</b> <b>effects</b> could be demonstrated against the unenveloped adenovirus type 4 or echovirus type 11. The extent of virus inactivation {{was found to be}} dependent upon the AME concentration, contact time, and temperature. No consistent effect of the virus concentration on the probability of plaque-forming unit inactivation could be determined. The <b>antiviral</b> <b>effects</b> of AME were partially antagonized by the presence of serum. Binding of AME to vesicular stomatitis virus was demonstrated by the comigration of drug and virus in linear sucrose gradients. AME represents a new class of antiviral agents with activity at concentrations relevant to therapeutics. Sterol components of the host cell membrane that become incorporated into the viral envelope are postulated as the site of reaction with AME...|$|R

50|$|The protein down-regulates {{transcription}} {{from the}} HIV-1 {{long terminal repeat}} promoter region, suggesting that function of this protein may be to mediate interferon's <b>antiviral</b> <b>effects.</b> Other proteins that function to restrict HIV replication include TRIM5alpha and APOBEC3G.|$|R
50|$|The <b>antiviral</b> <b>effect</b> of NRTIs and NtRTIs is {{essentially}} the same; they are analogues of the naturally occurring deoxynucleotides needed to synthesize the viral DNA and they compete with the natural deoxynucleotides for incorporation into the growing viral DNA chain. However, unlike the natural deoxynucleotides substrates, NRTIs and NtRTIs lack a 3′-hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose moiety. As a result, following incorporation of an NRTI or an NtRTI, the next incoming deoxynucleotide cannot form the next 5′-3′ phosphodiester bond needed to extend the DNA chain. Thus, when an NRTI or NtRTI is incorporated, viral DNA synthesis is halted, {{a process known as}} chain termination. All NRTIs and NtRTIs are classified as competitive substrate inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to inhibiting the dengue virus (DENV) in some species of genus Aedes, Wolbachia {{has been identified}} to inhibit replication of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in A. aegypti. The Wmel strain of Wolbachia pipientis significantly reduced infection and dissemination rates of CHIKV in mosquitoes, compared to Wolbachia uninfected controls and the same phenomenon was observed in yellow fever virus infection converting this bacterium in an excellent promise for YFV and CHIKV suppression. Another study tested the effect of Wolbachia on the replication of West Nile virus (WNV), but in cell line Aag2 derived from A. aegypti cells, suggesting that despite {{the existence of an}} enhancement of viral genomic RNA replication in the cell line Wolbachia infected, the production of secreted virus was significantly inhibited. Also, the <b>antiviral</b> <b>effect</b> in intrathoracically infected mosquitoes depends on the strain of Wolbachia, and the replication of the virus in orally fed mosquitoes was completely inhibited in wMelPop strain of Wolbachia.|$|E
50|$|Vidarabine {{works by}} {{interfering with the}} {{synthesis}} of viral DNA. It is a nucleoside analog and therefore has to be phosphorylated to be active. This is a three-step process in which vidarabine is sequentially phosphorylated by kinases to the triphosphate ara-ATP. This is the active form of vidarabine and is both an inhibitor and a substrate of viral DNA polymerase.When used as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase, ara-ATP competitively inhibits dATP leading {{to the formation of}} ‘faulty’ DNA. This is where ara-ATP is incorporated into the DNA strand replacing many of the adenosine bases. This results in the prevention of DNA synthesis, as phosphodiester bridges can no longer to be built, destabilizing the strand.Vidarabine triphosphate (ara-ATP) also inhibits RNA polyadenylation; preventing polyadenylation essential for HIV-1 and other retroviruses; and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, preventing transmethylation reactions.Uniquely to vidarabine, the diphosphorylated vidarabine (ara-ADP) also has an inhibitory effect. Other nucleoside analogs need to be triphosphorlated to give any <b>antiviral</b> <b>effect,</b> but ara-ADP inhibits the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. This prevents the reduction of nucleotide diphosphates, causing a reduction of viral replication.|$|E

When interferon was washed out within 48 h, their growth recovered gradually. The effects of interferon on cell growth depended on the amount of interferon added per cell. A subline, named IF r, was isolated which grows in the presence of 2 ooo units/ml of interferon, whereas growth of vesicular stomatitis virus in these cells is suppressed by IO units/ml of interferon, just as in the parent cells.

50|$|Myricetin {{has been}} seen to {{demonstrate}} antiviral activity against a number of viruses including Moloney murine leukemia virus, Rauscher murine leukemia virus, and the human immunodeficiency virus. Its effects against the proliferation of viruses {{is thought to be}} a consequence of myricetin’s ability to inhibit the proper functioning of reverse transcriptase. Myricetin was identified as a competitive inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase of Rauscher murine leukemia virus and a partial competitor with respect to the human immunodeficiency virus. Investigations into the activity of the HIV-1 strain when introduced to myricetin suggest the <b>antiviral</b> <b>effects</b> are derived from the inhibition of HIV-1 integrase, however, there are suspicions that the inhibition is non-specific. Structural analysis of myricetin and other flavonoids with observed <b>antiviral</b> <b>effects</b> indicate that the 3,4’ free hydroxyl groups likely are responsible for inhibition.|$|R

40|$|The {{replication}} of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in hepatocytes is strongly inhibited {{in response to}} IFN-α/β and IFN-γ. Although it has been previously demonstrated that IFN-α/β eliminates HBV RNA-containing capsids from the cell in a proteasome-dependent manner, the precise cellular pathway that mediates this <b>antiviral</b> <b>effect</b> has not been identified. Because IFN-induced signal transduction involves kinase-mediated activation of gene expression, we used an immortalized hepatocyte cell line that replicates HBV in an IFN-sensitive manner to investigate the role of cellular kinase activity and the cellular transcription and translation machinery in the <b>antiviral</b> <b>effect.</b> Our results indicate that Janus kinase activity {{is required for the}} <b>antiviral</b> <b>effect</b> of IFN against HBV, but that phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase, cyclin-dependent kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and NF-κB activity are not. Additionally, we found that inhibitors of cellular transcription and translation completely abolish the <b>antiviral</b> <b>effect,</b> which also appears to require cellular kinase activity downstream of signal transduction and gene expression. Collectively, these results identify IFN-regulated pathways that interrupt the HBV replication cycle by eliminating viral RNA-containing capsids from the cell, and they provide direction for discovery of the terminal effector molecules that ultimately mediate this <b>antiviral</b> <b>effect...</b>|$|E

Cells could not be protected against he cytopathogenic effect of vaccinia, herpes, Echo or vesicular stomatitis virus at m. o. i. > I. At a m. o. i, of ~< I, cells could be protected but the amount of interferon ecessary to yield protection was inversely related to the m. o. i. When protection was afforded, it was only transient. The duration of the <b>antiviral</b> <b>effect</b> of interferon was also inversely related to the m. o. i. The dependence of the <b>antiviral</b> <b>effect</b> on the m. o. i, could not be explained by assuming the viruses to be mixtures of subtypes with different interferon sensitivity. Also, selection by interferon treatment of interferon-insensitive subtypes couldnot be shown. The greater <b>antiviral</b> <b>effect</b> of interferon at low m. o. i, was probably not caused by induction of interferon by the infecting virus. A direct inactivation by the virus of the <b>antiviral</b> <b>effect</b> of interferon could not be demonstrated.

50|$|As a {{pharmaceutical}} agent, some research {{has suggested that}} administration of dehydroascorbic acid may confer protection from neuronal injury following an ischemic stroke. The literature contains many reports on the <b>antiviral</b> <b>effects</b> of vitamin C, and one study suggests dehydroascorbic acid has stronger <b>antiviral</b> <b>effects</b> and a different mechanism of action than ascorbic acid. Solutions in water containing ascorbic acid and copper ions and/or peroxide, resulting in rapid oxidation of ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic acid, have been shown to possess powerful but short-lived antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiviral properties, and have been used to treat gingivitis, periodontal disease, and dental plaque. A pharmaceutical product named Ascoxal is an example of such a solution used as a mouth rinse as an oral mucolytic and prophylactic agent against gingivitis. Ascoxal solution has also been tested with positive results as a treatment for recurrent mucocutaneous herpes, and as a mucolytic agent in acute and chronic pulmonary disease such as emphysema, bronchitis, and asthma by aerosol inhalation.|$|R
40|$|Viruses use {{a limited}} set of host {{pathways}} for infection. These pathways represent bona fide antiviral targets with low likelihood of viral resistance. We identified the salicylanilide niclosamide as {{a broad range}} antiviral agent targeting acidified endosomes.
