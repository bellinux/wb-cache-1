According to the company, its technology sends <b>audible</b> <b>signals</b> only in the direction of travel, thus allowing the vehicle to be heard by those who may be in the car's path, without disturbing others with unwelcome noise. Insero Horsens, a Danish venture company, has provided a significant investment to help ECTunes fully develop its technology.|$|E
2500|$|The {{alternate}} {{purpose is}} [...] "look-down/shoot-down" [...] capability required to improve military air combat survivability. Pulse-Doppler {{is also used}} for ground based surveillance radar required to defend personnel and vehicles. Pulse-Doppler signal processing increases the maximum detection distance using less radiation {{in close proximity to}} aircraft pilots, shipboard personnel, infantry, and artillery. Reflections from terrain, water, and weather produce signals much larger than aircraft and missiles, which allows fast moving vehicles to hide using nap-of-the-earth flying techniques and stealth technology to avoid detection until an attack vehicle is too close to destroy. Pulse-Doppler signal processing incorporates more sophisticated electronic filtering that safely eliminates this kind of weakness. This requires the use of medium pulse-repetition frequency with phase coherent hardware that has a large dynamic range. Military applications require medium PRF which prevents range from being determined directly, and range ambiguity resolution processing is required to identify the true range of all reflected signals. Radial movement is usually linked with Doppler frequency to produce a lock signal that cannot be produced by radar jamming signals. Pulse-Doppler signal processing also produces <b>audible</b> <b>signals</b> {{that can be used for}} threat identification.|$|E

50|$|The Marèges Dam is a {{concrete}} arch dam on the Dordogne River. It is located 4 km southeast of Liginiac in Corrèze department, France. It was constructed between 1932 and 1935 by the Railway Company du Midi. Its primary purpose is {{the generation of}} hydroelectricity and the original power station contained four Francis turbine-generators. The dam and power plant was built to help France become less dependent on costly energy resource imports after World War I. The fifth Francis turbine-generator, rated at 122 MW, at the Saint Pierre power station, on the left bank of the river, was commissioned in 1988. The dam, designed by André Coyne, incorporated several innovative features to include a ski-jump spillway, the right abutment anchored with a prestressed cable and monitored with <b>audible</b> <b>signals</b> and a new cofferdam design.|$|E
