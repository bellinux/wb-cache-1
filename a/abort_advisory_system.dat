Design/methodology/approach: In this article the <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> was created in Exsys Professional program. What is more, the system was upgraded with a help tool – a database, because it makes possible to collect and keep data. The database as such was created with the use of Microsoft Access 2000, an integral part of Microsoft Office for Windows. Findings: Based on comprehensive literature, the article reviewed the implementation of the <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> in some small enterprises, because a system operator can very quickly adjust the structures (organizational and project teams) to a project.

40|$|Abstract: The {{problem of}} {{evaluation}} of <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> quality is studied. Specifically, 18 advisory strategies for op-erators {{of a cold}} rolling mill were designed using different modelling assumptions. Since some assumptions may be more appropriate in different working regimes, we also design a new advising strategy based on the on-line merging of advices. In order to measure actual suitability of the <b>advisory</b> <b>systems,</b> we define two measures: operator’s performance index and coincidence of the observed operator’s actions with the advices. A time-variant model of <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> suitability is proposed. Merging of the advices is achieved using Bayesian theory of decision-making. Final assessment of the original <b>advisory</b> <b>systems</b> and the new system is performed on data recorded during 6 months of operation of a real rolling mill. This task {{is complicated by the}} fact that the operator did not follow any of the recommendations generated by the <b>advisory</b> <b>systems.</b> Val-idation was thus performed with respect to the proposed measures. It was found that merging of the advising strategies can significantly improve quality of advising. The approach is general enough to be used in many similar problems. ...|$|R

Whereas institutional approaches, most often in (comparative) public administration, identify features of politico-administrative systems to account for policy-making such as politicization or {{the role of the}} centre, policy perspectives explain policy-making by factors related to the respective policy domain, e. g. frames or agenda-setting. This divide becomes crucial in the analysis of policy advice.

Hence, concerns have been voiced as regards the capacity of the <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> to be able to incorporate new knowledge, resulting in a growing interest in how advisors obtain and construct the knowledge necessary for offering adequate advisory services to their clients. In this article we explore how advisors within the English land management <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> (land agents, applied ecologists and veterinarians) develop and optimise their knowledge by engaging in different kinds of networks (centralised, distributed and decentralised), each of which employs a different type of social capital. Key findings suggest that to obtain the knowledge needed to solve complex queries of clients, advisors use distributed networks and draw upon informal ‘communities of practice’ within their own advisory profession characterised by bonding social capital, but also draw upon broader ‘networks of practice’ involving multiple advisors from different advisory professions, which rely on bridging social capital. The employment of decentralised networks which rely on linking social capital, to solve complex queries or develop new services, for example through contacts with scientific institutes, appears to be less developed, despite brokering activities of the professional associations. Whereas fragmentation and disconnect due to competition and epistemological differences do play a role; they do not appear to prevent overall knowledge exchange among advisors within and across different professions. Assumptions of a collapse of interaction within the land management <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> are not supported by the evidence, as there appears to be much bonding and bridging social capital.

40|$|Purpose: To promote {{sustainable}} agriculture, various {{development projects}} are encouraging farmers around Madagascar's Lake Alaotra to adopt conservation agriculture techniques. This article's {{objective is to}} analyze the capacity of a project-funded <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> to accompany such an innovation and to design and implement an advisory method aimed at fostering learning processes for sustainable changes at the farm level. Design/methodology/approach: We used an analytical framework where three components {{are responsible for the}} <b>advisory</b> <b>system's</b> performance: the governance, including the funding mechanisms, the methods for generating advice and the capacities of actors involved in the provision of advice. We carried out surveys with the main actors involved in advisory services and with farmers involved in conservation agriculture. Findings: Results of the study highlight the current domination of technical advice dedicated to promoting conservation agriculture based on recommendations arising from agricultural research. Even if advisory actors show a willingness to promote advisory services which address the overall farm complexity, the results question the advisory method used and the ability of advisors to adopt an <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> built jointly with the farmers. The farmers and farmers' organizations have a limited ability to influence choices made by the project.

An intelligent CAD system should be able to assist a designer during the product design process by detecting design problems, providing alternative suggestions and correcting design violations. This research concentrates on developing a collaborative design <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> based on a constraint-based product modeling environment. ^ We classify engineering constraints during the product design process as component design constraints, manufacturing constraints and assembly constraints. Engineering constraints are modeled and managed in close relation to assembly and component models. We develop an enhanced assembly modeling scheme based on spatial relationships and introduce mating bonds in the assembly for easy and systematic integration with the design <b>advisory</b> <b>system.</b> The representation and management of constraints are elaborated at the component level and assembly level using a graph-based approach. ^ We develop a model for a design <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> which is embedded in the constraint modeling scheme.

The interactions among these three sub-models is reasoned from the constraint graphs. The assembly design <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> plays an important role from the viewpoint of the whole product design, so it is amplified in detail.
