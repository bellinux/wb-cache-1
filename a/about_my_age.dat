The British and French troops were in bad shape – even guys <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> looked old and tired. After three years of living and dying inside a dirt trench, you know the Brits and French were happy to see us [...] "doughboys." [...] Every last one of us Yanks believed we’d wrap this thing up in a month or two and head back home before harvest. In other words, we were the typical, cocky Americans no one wants around, until they need help winning a war." ...|$|E
500|$|Calle 13 {{once again}} became {{the subject of}} debate when the duo {{traveled}} to Cuba in March 2010, to perform in front of the American embassy in the country. Before the show, a political prisoner had died in a hunger strike in protest of the Cuban government, and Cuban exiles in Miami criticized the group for performing at such a time. Residente defended the performance, noting that it had been inaccurately reported and that [...] "we said things that no artist had said from the stage, like 'here the people are in charge, and the government has to obey.'" [...] These events had a major impact on Residente's lyrical style and the subjects he planned to discuss on the new album: [...] "What's making me more mature is not <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> it's about what I'm seeing and living. I'm not saying things carelessly anymore. I'm thinking before I say them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jindal's {{nickname}} {{dates to}} his childhood identification with Bobby Brady, an ABC sitcom character. He has said, [...] "Every day after school, I'd {{come home and}} I'd watch The Brady Bunch. And I identified with Bobby, you know? He was <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> and 'Bobby' stuck." [...] He has been known by his nickname ever since, although his legal name remains Piyush Jindal.|$|E
60|$|I looked. He was <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own <b>age,</b> broad-shouldered, deep-chested, eyes sparkling, and ruddy-cheeked with health. A finer {{specimen}} of manhood {{one would not}} ask.|$|R
60|$|As I {{started to}} obey, my chest {{swelling}} with pride in my mission, Jed Dunham cried {{out that he}} wanted to go with me. Jed was <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own <b>age.</b>|$|R
60|$|At the {{masthead}} I {{made the}} acquaintance of two youngsters of <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own <b>age,</b> {{one of whom}} informed {{me that he had}} been there three hundred and thirty-two days out of the year.|$|R
2500|$|In the 50th anniversary special, [...] "The Day of the Doctor" [...] (2013), the Eleventh Doctor is queried {{about his}} age by his younger self, to which he replies [...] "I dunno, I lose track. Twelve hundred and {{something}} I think, unless I'm lying. I can't remember if I'm lying <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> – that's how old I am." [...] He makes several references to being 400 years older than the War Doctor, which would encompass the timelines of the Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh Doctors. In the next episode, [...] "The Time of the Doctor", the Doctor spends centuries defending the planet Trenzalore. After one interval, the Doctor states he has lived there for 300 years. Another long interval passes, during which the Doctor's age is not given, but he physically ages considerably before regenerating into the Twelfth Doctor. The 2014 e-book Tales of Trenzalore states the Doctor spent 900 years on Trenzalore.|$|E
2500|$|... "On {{the fourth}} day of August we reached the north bank of the Republican River and went into camp. At 9 o'clock that evening, three white men came into camp and {{reported}} {{to me that a}} large band of Sioux warriors [...] camped 25 miles [...] northwest, waiting for an opportunity to attack the Pawnees for several days, anticipating that we would move up the river where buffaloes were feeding. Previous to this, white men visited us and warned us to be on our guard against Sioux attacks, and I was a trifle skeptical as to the truth of the story told by our white visitors. But one of the men, a young man <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> at the time, appeared to be so sincere in his efforts to impress upon me that the warning should be heeded, that I took him to Sky Chief who was in command that day, for a conference. Sky Chief said the men were liars; that they wanted to scare the Pawnees away from the hunting grounds so that white men could kill buffaloes for hides. He told me I was squaw and a coward. I took exception to his remarks, and retorted: 'I will go as far as you dare go. Don't forget that.' ...|$|E
60|$|I noticed, by the by, that {{although}} Mr. Micawber {{was just as}} much confused as ever <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> and standing, he always remembered, as a genteel thing, that I was a pupil of Doctor Strong's.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} the remotest idea," [...] said Johnny. [...] "He {{is a man}} <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own <b>age,</b> very good-looking, and {{apparently}} very well {{able to take care}} of himself. He is short-sighted, and holds a glass in one eye when he looks out of a carriage-window. That's all that I know about him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I shouldn't {{care how}} soon. When {{a man has}} worked as I have done, he gets <b>about</b> tired at <b>my</b> <b>age.</b> I suppose I'd better be down at the committee-room about ten to-morrow?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{observed}} {{that they were}} both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to conceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door, I also {{observed that}} they both looked of <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own <b>age,</b> or rather younger, {{and that they were}} greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice, and (as far as I could see) face too.|$|R
6000|$|... "Walters looks <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> and is {{thin and}} dark; an amusing fellow and remarkably well informed. In fact, I couldn't guess his nationality; {{he seemed to}} have been everywhere. He had good manners, but somehow one missed----" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS LUTESTRING [very decisively] If it is a {{question}} <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> Mr Chief Secretary, it had better not be asked. All that concerns you about my personal affairs {{can be found in the}} books of the Accountant General.|$|E
6000|$|... "Seems to me poor {{children}} have better times than rich ones. I can't go out, {{and there is}} a girl <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> splashing along, without any maid to fuss about rubbers and cloaks and umbrellas and colds. I wish I was a beggar-girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he {{is a fine}} fellow; but you see, he {{is seven}} or eight years older than I am, while I feel with you that you are <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own <b>age.</b> By the way, it is high time that we dropped calling each other by our surnames, {{especially}} as mine is such a long one; so in future let us be' Henri' and 'Leigh 'to each other. Most of the peasants call me Henri." ...|$|R
60|$|All our doubts, however, {{upon this}} head were very soon set at rest, {{for on the}} very day that the {{repairing}} and the furnishing had been completed I had occasion to ride into Wigtown, and I met upon the way a carriage which was bearing General Heatherstone and his family to their new home. An elderly lady, worn and sickly-looking, was by his side, and opposite him sat a young fellow <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own <b>age</b> and a girl who appeared to be a couple of years younger.|$|R
60|$|Although he did {{not look}} very healthy,--having pimples on his face, and a {{breaking}} out at his mouth,--these dreadful preparations quite appalled me. I judged him to be <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own <b>age,</b> but he was much taller, and he had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance. For the rest, he was a young gentleman in a gray suit (when not denuded for battle), with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in advance of the rest of him as to development.|$|R
6000|$|... "You do not know--he {{may have}} had a {{daughter}} of <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> or size, or appearance; or with my laugh, or voice, or something else that reminds him of her, when he sees me. One thing I am sure of-- Peter is no enemy of MINE" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “So far as I can recollect, he had light hair, and {{his eyes}} were a darker blue than you often see; <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> I think, and unmistakably a sailor, but he had a smart look and the stamp of command. Do you know anybody like that?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only {{that there}} are four of them. Kate is older than you, Fred and Frank (twins) <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> and a little girl (Grace), who is nine or ten. Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys. I fancied, {{from the way he}} primmed up his mouth in {{speaking}} of her, that he didn't admire Kate much." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were some}} boys of <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own <b>age,</b> William's sons, {{and as they}} at once led me away down into the grove, I can say little {{of what went on}} in the house after that. It must have been still in the warm September weather for we climbed the slender leafy trees and swayed and swung on their tip-tops like bobolinks. Perhaps I did not go so very high after all but I had the feeling of being very close to the sky.|$|R
60|$|Our guide {{about the}} camp, the {{half-breed}} {{son of a}} St. Louis trader, was a big, fine-featured, intelligent man of <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own <b>age,</b> whose pleasant lips, and deep brown eyes attracted me. He knew everybody, both white and red, {{and as soon as}} he understood my wish to write fairly of his people, he gave himself unreservedly to our service. Taking us from lodge to lodge, he introduced us to the men whose characters were of the most value in my study and told them of my wish to report them with sympathy and truth.|$|R
60|$|It {{was late}} one sultry night when I sat moodily beside {{an open window}} in my house at Gaspard's Trail. I had risen before the sun that morning, but, though tired with a long day's ride, I felt restless and ill-disposed to sleep. Thomas Steel, whose {{homestead}} stood some leagues away, lounged close by with his unlighted pipe on his knee and his coarse sun-faded shirt flung open showing his bronzed neck and the paler color of his ample chest. He was <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own <b>age</b> and possessed the frame of a gladiator, but there was limp dejection in his attitude.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's a goodish stretch, sir. I {{come up in}} a cab, and the cab's {{waiting to}} be paid. We could go back in it before you paid it, if you liked. I went first to your office, {{according}} to {{the direction of the}} papers found in the pockets, and there I see nobody but a chap of <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> who sent me on here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are exaggerating altogether," [...] Cyril said; [...] "and yet, in {{what you}} say <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> I think you are partly right. I have lived {{most of my life}} alone; I have had much care always on my shoulders, and grave responsibility; thus it is that I am older in many ways than I should be at my years. I would it were not so. I have not had any boyhood, as other boys have, and I think it has been a great misfortune for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Age {{does not}} go by years," [...] said Mrs. Dobbs Broughton. [...] "We all know that. 'His hair was grey, but not with years.' Look here, Conway," [...] and she moved back her tresses from off her temples to show him that there were gray hairs behind. He did not see them; and had they been very visible she might not perhaps have been so ready to exhibit them. [...] "No one can say that length of years has blanched them. I have no secrets from you <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>age.</b> One should not be grey before one has reached thirty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh, but, of course, {{there are}} heaps {{of them that}} I couldn’t {{possibly}} be—women who’ve got grandchildren or sons {{old enough to have}} celebrated their coming of age. I’ve only got to consider the ones <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own <b>age.</b> I tell you how you might help me this afternoon, if you don’t mind; go through any of the back numbers of Country Life and those sort of papers that you can find in the smoking-room, and see if you come across my portrait with infant son or anything of that sort. It won’t take you ten minutes. I’ll meet you in the lounge about tea-time. Thanks awfully.” ...|$|R
60|$|Anneke {{thanked him}} for this pledge, and the {{conversation}} changed. There {{was a young man}} present, who bore the name of Schuyler, and who was nearly related to Madam, with whose air, manner and appearance I was much struck. His aunt called him 'Philip;' and, being <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own <b>age,</b> during this visit I got into conversation with him. He told me he was attached to the commissariat under Gen. Bradstreet, and that he should move on with the army, as soon as the preparations for its marching were completed. He then entered into a clear, simple explanation of the supposed plan of the approaching campaign.|$|R
60|$|Up to {{this time}} I had both hated and feared them, {{knowing that they}} hated and despised me, and now, {{suddenly}} I was thrust among them and put on my own defenses. For a few weeks I felt like a young rooster in a strange barn-yard,--knowing that I would {{be called upon to}} prove my quality. In fact it took but a week or two to establish my place in the tribe for {{one of the leaders of}} the gang was Mitchell Scott, a powerful lad of <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own <b>age,</b> and to his friendship I owe a large part of my freedom from persecution.|$|R
6000|$|My officer, Lieutenant Linderwood, was as ill as {{the captain}} of the sloop, and was carried ashore, too. They were both young men of <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> who had been {{delicate}} in the West India climate. I even took that in bad part. I thought I was much fitter for the work than they were, and that if all of us had our deserts, I should be both of them rolled into one. (It may be imagined what sort of an officer of marines I should have made, without the power of reading a written order. And as to any knowledge how to command the sloop--Lord! I should have sunk her in a quarter of an hour!) ...|$|E
60|$|And William Coleman, then a merchant's clerk, <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> {{who had the}} coolest, clearest head, {{the best}} heart, and the exactest morals of almost any man I ever met with. He became {{afterwards}} a merchant of great note, {{and one of our}} provincial judges. Our friendship continued without interruption to his death, upwards of forty years; and the club continued almost as long, and was the best school of philosophy, morality, and politics that then existed in the province; for our queries, which were read the week preceding their discussion, put us upon reading with attention upon the several subjects, that we might speak more to the purpose; and here, too, we acquired better habits of conversation, everything being studied in our rules which might prevent our disgusting each other. From hence the long continuance of the club, which I shall have frequent occasion to speak further of hereafter.|$|E
6000|$|... "I lived till a {{fortnight}} ago in lodgings, having two rooms, one {{a very good}} one; and paying for everything fifty-six dollars a month, the dollar being four shillings and twopence. This you will see is dear; but I could make no better arrangement, for there is an unusual affluence of strangers this year. I have now come {{to live with a}} friend, a Dr. Calvert, in a small house of our own, where I am much more comfortable, and live greatly cheaper. He is a friend of Mrs. Percival's; <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> an Oriel man, and a very superior person. I think the chances are, we shall go home together.... I cannot tell you of all the other people I have become familiar with; and shall only mention in addition Bingham Baring, eldest son of Lord Ashburton, who was here for some weeks on account of a dying brother, and whom I saw a great deal of. He is a pleasant, very good-natured and rather clever man; Conservative Member for North Staffordshire.|$|E
60|$|Hereupon, {{the colonel}} {{and my father}} knocked the ashes out of their pipes at the same instant, and both laughed,--a merriment in which the parson, my grandfather, my dear mother, and I myself joined. Even a negro boy, who was <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own <b>age,</b> and whose name was Jacob, or Jaap, but who was {{commonly}} called Yaap, grinned at the remark, for he had a sovereign contempt for Yankee Land, and all it contained; almost as sovereign a contempt as that which Yankee Land entertained for York itself, and its Dutch population. Dirck {{was the only person}} present who looked grave; but Dirck was habitually as grave and sedate, {{as if he had been}} born to become a burgomaster.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a girl}} of <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own <b>age</b> in the farm-house family, and she sat {{opposite}} {{to me at the}} narrow table at meal-times. It had come into my mind, at our first dinner, that she might take the fever from me. The thought had not disquieted me then. I had only speculated how she would look under the altered circumstances, and whether she would die. But it came into my mind now, that I might try to prevent her taking the fever by keeping away from her. I knew I should have but scrambling board if I did; so much the less worldly and less devilish the deed would be, I thought.|$|R
60|$|One {{day there}} came a cry from behind a curtained window. I stood {{still for a moment}} and then ran; but before I could get far enough away I heard it again, a long, {{piercing}} cry, growing fiercer before it ceased; so that I ran faster still, not heeding where I went, till I found myself in a raw, unfinished street, ending in black waste land, bordering the river. I stopped, panting, wondering how I should find my way again. To recover myself and think I sat upon the doorstep of an empty house, and there came dancing down the road with a curious, half-running, half-hopping step--something like a water wagtail's--a child, a boy <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own <b>age,</b> who, after eyeing me strangely sat down beside me.|$|R
