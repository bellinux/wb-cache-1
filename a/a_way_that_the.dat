5|$|A matroid is a {{mathematical}} structure in which certain sets of elements are defined to be independent, in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> independent sets satisfy properties {{modeled after the}} properties of linear independence in a vector space. One of the standard examples of a matroid is the graphic matroid in which the independent sets are the sets of edges in forests of a graph; the matroid structure of forests is important in algorithms for computing the minimum spanning tree of the graph. Analogously, we may define matroids from pseudoforests.|$|E
5|$|Cena hosts American Grit on Fox, {{which is}} a reality {{television}} series with 10 episodes. 16 {{men and women were}} split into four teams, where challenges were given. A $1 million USD prize was given to the winning team. American Grit premiered on Fox on April 14, 2016. Cena has been retweeting motivational tweets from his followers on Twitter who used the hashtag #ShowYourGrit, in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fan did something motivational to his/her friends in a real-life scenario. The finale of Season 1 aired on June 9, 2016.|$|E

5|$|Passive constructions {{also use}} {{auxiliary}} verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{object of the}} active phrase becomes {{the subject of the}} passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with get. For example, putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen (by her), or he gets seen (by her).|$|E
5|$|Some {{eukaryotic}} cells, {{such as the}} protist Euglena, {{also have}} flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tip of the flagellum whips in a circle. The eukaryotic flagellum, also called a cilium or undulipodium, is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.|$|E
5|$|The Church of San Benedetto in Catania (Illustrations 15 and 16) is a {{fine example}} of a Sicilian Baroque interior, {{decorated}} between 1726 and 1762, the period when Sicilian Baroque was at the height of its fashion and individuality. The ceilings were frescoed by the artist Giovanni Tuccari. The most spectacular part of the church's decoration is the nun's choir (Illustrations 16), created c. 1750, which was designed in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> nuns' voices could be heard during services, but the nuns themselves were still quite separate from and unseen by the less spiritual world outside.|$|E

Many rural cemeteries, including Oakwood, subsequently became virtual outdoor sculpture museums, displaying the works of well-known contemporary sculptors as memorials to the deceased. Oakwood is home to thousands of individual statues and sculptures as well as 24 private mausolea. Because of its popularity as a public park, many memorials included benches to invite visitors to rest while investigating the large, hilly property.|$|E

5|$|Theistic {{evolution}} was {{the idea}} that God intervened in the process of evolution, to guide it in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> living world could still be considered to be designed. The term was promoted by Charles Darwin's greatest American advocate Asa Gray. However, this idea gradually fell out of favor among scientists, as they became more and more committed to the idea of methodological naturalism and came to believe that direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive. By 1900, theistic evolution had largely disappeared from professional scientific discussions, although it retained a strong popular following.|$|E

About 50 million years after they were deposited, the tectonic plate of which they were a part collided with another small plate {{and then with the}} proto-North American continent. The collisions, which welded the plates to the continent, folded the Cleopatra tuff in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two ore bodies ended up on opposite sides of a fold called the Jerome anticline.|$|E

The edges of the platforms are labelled platform 1 and 2, and platform 3 and 4, in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two outer tracks are accessible from platforms 1 and 4, and the central track, usually used by trains that terminate and reverse at Arnos Grove station, is accessible from platforms 2 and 3. Platforms 1 and 2 are designated for trains to Cockfosters while platforms 3 and 4 are for trains to Central London.|$|E

After attempting but failing to override the veto, Congress swiftly crafted new legislation, the Apportionment Act of 1792, which Washington signed into law on April 14.|$|E

5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios. The ambulance is fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, {{in the manner of a}} traffic broadcast, but in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into every RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} made in September 2008, the Social Democrats, the Conservative People's Party, the Liberal Party and the Danish People's Party {{agreed to}} not fund {{an expansion of}} the metro northwest. Initially, the system operated trains from 01:00 to 05:00 only on Thursdays through Saturdays, but, starting on 19 March 2009, night service was extended {{to the rest of the}} week. This caused a logistical challenge, because Metro Service used the nights for maintenance. The routes were therefore set up in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> system could be operated on only a single track, leaving the other free for work. In May 2009, six companies were pre-qualified to bid for the public service obligation to operate the metro. These were Serco-NedRailways, Ansaldo STS, Arriva, S-Bahn Hamburg, Keolis and DSB Metroâ€”a joint venture between DSB and RATP. The process was delayed because of a procedural error by Metroselskabet, who failed to pre-qualify DSB Metro.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to retelling the plot from Metroid, Metroid: Zero Mission introduces new cinematics {{to push the}} story forward. Sakamoto believed {{in the importance of}} having a story to complement a game. He found it particularly difficult to convey the game's plot accurately in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> player can understand, because of the sparse use of dialogue in the Metroid series. The story for Metroid: Zero Mission was rewritten to explore Samus Aran's backstory more than in the original Metroid. Cinematics are used to show Samus' memories to move the story forward and to keep the plot open for interpretation. Sakamoto claimed that this was intended to expand the original story while retaining some mystery. The game is the first Metroid game to let the player choose a difficulty level {{at the start of the}} game; each of three levels varies in the amount of damage caused by enemies. The battle with Mother Brain marked the end of the original Metroid; however, Metroid: Zero Mission offers players extra levels to play after the battle.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 20 November Stavka telephoned Stalingrad Front {{commander}} Andrei Yeremenko asking if he would begin his portion of the offensive on schedule, at 08:00. He responded he would do so only if the fog lifted; although the 51st Army opened its artillery barrage on time because front headquarters could not contact the division, {{the rest of the}} forces prepared for the operation received orders to postpone the attack until 10:00. The 51st Army engaged the Romanian 6th Corps, taking many prisoners. As the 57th Army joined the attack at 10:00, the situation developed in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Stalingrad Front could throw its armored corps into battle. The German 297th Infantry Division watched as its Romanian support failed to put up resistance against the Red Army. However, confusion and lack of control caused the Soviet 4th and 13th Mechanized Corps to stumble as they began to exploit the breakthroughs achieved by the opening offensive.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1943, Alvarez {{returned}} to the United States with an offer from Robert Oppenheimer to work at Los Alamos on the Manhattan project. But Oppenheimer suggested that he first spend a few months at the University of Chicago working with Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos. During these months, General Leslie Groves asked Alvarez to think of <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> US could {{find out if the}} Germans were operating any nuclear reactors, and, if so, where they were. Alvarez suggested that an airplane could carry a system to detect the radioactive gases that a reactor produces, particularly xenon 133. The equipment did fly over Germany, but detected no radioactive xenon because the Germans had not built a reactor capable of a chain reaction. This was the first idea of monitoring fission products for intelligence gathering. It would become extremely important after the war.|$|E
5|$|Made on {{a budget}} of 180 million {{including}} production, prints and advertising, and marketing, Mary Kom earned 200 million, and before release recouped more than its cost from brand tie-ups. The film made profits before the release. Partnership was arranged in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> products from brands were either showcased in the film or the brands promoted the film in their advertising. The satellite rights of the film were sold for 140 million and music rights for 30 million. The film was released in DVDs on 15 October 2014 across all regions in a one-disc pack in NTSC format. Distributed by Shemaroo Entertainment, it contained behind-the-scene footage and deleted scenes. The VCD and Blu-ray versions were released at the same time. The Mary Kom Blu-ray is the first Blu-ray title in India to feature a Dolby Atmos soundtrack.|$|E
