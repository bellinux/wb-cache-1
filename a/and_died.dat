After analysis {{of the characteristics of}} the metal stamping development process and the interaction level among part design <b>and</b> <b>die</b> design activities, the needs for concurrent stamping part <b>and</b> <b>die</b> design are explored in depth, and an activity model for concurrent stamping part <b>and</b> <b>die</b> development is presented. A framework is proposed to support concurrent stamping part <b>and</b> <b>die</b> development by providing computer aided environments for part, process <b>and</b> <b>die</b> design, advisory tools for part stampability evaluation and part cost estimation, as well as process <b>and</b> <b>die</b> evaluation, <b>and</b> knowledge bases incorporated in the advisory tools. According to the framework, a design support strategy for concurrent stamping part <b>and</b> <b>die</b> development is investigated to guide the coordination of design activities including material selection, part stampability evaluation, process planning <b>and</b> <b>die</b> design, as well as cost estimation. Based on the proposed approach and strategy, the system prototype has been developed employing the knowledge-based approach. The results of this research will facilitate the rationalization of stamping part <b>and</b> <b>die</b> development <b>and</b> thus reduce the cost of metal stamping development...|$|R

40|$|In This Paper {{we present}} a study of Split Punch <b>and</b> <b>Die</b> of Sheet Metal Blanking Process for Length Component. The Component with 740 mm length is {{considered}} and Analysis of Punch <b>and</b> <b>Die</b> was carried out for study. The Split Punch <b>and</b> <b>Die</b> techniques introduced is being studied in this paper {{and it is the}} most applicable technique for the lengthy components. Sheet metal parts are widely used in products of high complexity and precision such as vehicles, aircraft and other automobile related products. Therefore, the press process has been identified {{as one of the most}} important manufacturing processes. During Blanking Process the force acting is more between the punch <b>and</b> <b>die,</b> failure or damage may occurs as reaches some production, so need to replace the punch <b>and</b> <b>die</b> as damages occurs. For small components punch <b>and</b> <b>die</b> can easily replaceable, easy maintenance, easy handling, less time consuming and low cost. As we consider lengthy components punch <b>and</b> <b>die</b> the manufacturing, heat treatment, maintenance, handlings need more time and cost is also very high. By integrating the split method of punch <b>and</b> <b>die</b> will be highly beneficial also helps to reduce the cost and time for heat treatment, easy replaceable of damaged parts, easy maintenance, easy handling, good life and durability can be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays {{the tool}} <b>and</b> <b>die</b> {{industry}} has to meet various new challenges. An {{increasing number of}} production sites distributed world-wide requires a high flexibility in the procurement and maintenance of tools <b>and</b> <b>dies.</b> This flexibility is strongly connected to an increasing complexity and increasing costs. However, enterprises {{are more and more}} exposed to competitive pressure by new entrants from Eastern European Countries and the Far East branching out into the tool <b>and</b> <b>die</b> market with simple commodity moulds. To keep their business profitable, tool <b>and</b> <b>die</b> manufacturers need to strategically re-align their organisational management. A promising approach is the collaboration in at least regional tool <b>and</b> <b>die</b> making networks. Cost effects in terms of lower tooling costs and a decrease in maintenance efforts can be achieved as well as technological progress by joining the individual competencies of the collaborating tool <b>and</b> <b>die</b> makers. However, collaborations in production industry yield to new challenges for the participating enterprises.

The work is divided into four chapters, in which theoretical and practical knowledge is entwined and complemented. The first three chapters dwell on death, life after death and funeral rituals in general, and further on Romany history connected to their death <b>and</b> <b>dying</b> <b>and</b> contemporary Romany funeral traditions, including Romany faith in afterlife and spirits of the dead. The last chapter of the degree work summarizes {{the knowledge of the}} previous three chapters, and it is the very mentioned reflexion of the attitude of Romanies to death <b>and</b> <b>dying...</b>|$|R
