5|$|Skyscrapers are a {{relatively}} recent phenomenon in Japan. Due to aesthetic and engineering concerns, Japan's Building Standard Law set an absolute height limit of 31metres until 1963, when the limit was abolished {{in favor of a}} Floor <b>Area</b> <b>Ratio</b> limit. Following these changes in building regulations, the Kasumigaseki Building was constructed and completed in 1968. Double the height of Japan's previous tallest buildingthe 17-story Hotel New Otani Tokyothe Kasumigaseki Building is regarded as Japan's first modern high-rise building, rising 36stories and 156metres (512ft) in height. A booming post-war Japanese economy and the hosting of the 1964 Summer Olympics helped lead to a building boom in Tokyo during the 1960s and 1970s. Construction continued through the 1980s and 1990s as the Japanese asset price bubble rose and fell. Mainland Tokyo is divided into two sections: Western Tokyo and the special wards of Tokyo. All of the prefecture's tallest buildings are within the 23special wards, which comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City. Nishi-Shinjuku, a district within Shinjuku, was the prefecture's first major skyscraper development area. Starting with the construction of the Keio Plaza Hotel in the 1971, the district is now home to 11 of Tokyo's 40tallest skyscrapers.|$|E

The ossicles are essential for efficient coupling of sound waves into the cochlea, since the cochlea environment is a fluid–membrane system, and it takes more pressure to move sound through fluid–membrane waves than it does through air; a pressure increase is achieved by the <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> of the tympanic membrane to the oval window, resulting in a pressure gain of about 20 from the original sound wave pressure in air. This gain is a form of impedance matching – to match the soundwave travelling through air to that travelling in the fluid–membrane system.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} imagery registration/conflation and change {{detection}} requires sophisticated and robust methods to produce better image fusion, target recognition, and tracking. Ideally these methods should be invariant to arbitrary image affine transformations. A new abstract algebraic structural invariant approach with <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> {{can be used}} to identify corresponding features in two images and use them for registration/conflation. <b>Area</b> <b>ratios</b> of specific features do not change when an image is rescaled or skewed by an arbitrary affine transformation.

The mass <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> of the solar collector integrated in large-tilt-angle (70 °- 90 °) with south facades of the residential buildings in five meteorologic regions including 133 cities in China were calculated and analyzed.

25|$|Loons fly strongly, {{though they}} have high wing-loading (mass to wing <b>area</b> <b>ratio),</b> which complicates takeoff. Indeed, most species must run upwind across the water's surface with wings {{flapping}} to generate sufficient lift to take flight. Only the red-throated loon (G. stellata) can take off from land. Once airborne, loons are capable of long flights during migration. Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey, who have implanted satellite transmitters in some individuals, have recorded daily flights of up to 1078km in a 24-hour period, which probably resulted from single movements. North European loons migrate primarily via the South Baltic and directly over land to the Black Sea or Mediterranean. Loons can live as long as 30 years and can hold their breath {{for as long as}} 90 seconds while underwater.|$|E

[...] This percentage for large Alaskan glaciers is between 60 and 70 for non-calving glaciers, 70-80 for moderately calving glaciers and up to 90 for very high calving rate glaciers. By using accumulation <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> (AAR) data for Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers, Pelto (1987) and Viens (1995) produced models showing that climate acts as a first-order control on the advance/retreat cycle of calving glaciers during most of the advance retreat cycle, but there are climate insensitive periods as well. [...] Pelto (1987) examined the terminus behavior of 90 Alaskan glaciers and found that the terminus behavior of all 90 were correctly predicted based on the AAR and calving rate.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Using 1 H {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy (MRS), we quantitatively evaluated correlation representing linear relationship between the metabolite peak <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> associated with poor shimming conditions. The inadequate shimming due to linear shim offsets directly affected overall MR spectral quality as well as peak area for each metabolite. Three major peaks such as N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho) were used as a reference for data analysis. Despite considerable variations of metabolite peak area, a significant correlation between the metabolite peak <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> relative to Cr was established while {{the correlation between the}} peak <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> relative to Cho and NAA was not. The present study suggested that metabolite peak <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> based on the metabolite of Cr could be an acceptable quantification method even under the poor shimming in clinical MRS examination.

In general, magnums {{are thought to}} be higher quality, as there is less oxygen in the bottle, and the volume-to-surface <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> favours the creation of appropriately-sized bubbles. However, there is no hard evidence for this view. Other bottle sizes, mostly named for Biblical figures, are generally filled with Champagne that has been fermented in standard bottles or magnums.

2500|$|The F-15's {{maneuverability}} {{is derived}} from low wing loading (weight to wing <b>area</b> <b>ratio)</b> with a high thrust-to-weight ratio enabling the aircraft to turn tightly without losing airspeed. The F-15 can climb to [...] in around 60 seconds. The thrust output of the dual engines {{is greater than the}} aircraft's combat weight, so it has the ability to accelerate vertically. The weapons and flight control systems are designed so that one person can safely and effectively perform air-to-air combat. The A and C models are single-seat variants; these were the main air-superiority versions produced. B and D models add a second seat behind the pilot for training. E models use the second seat for a weapon systems officer. Visibly, the F-15 has a unique feature vis-à-vis other modern fighter aircraft: it does not have the distinctive turkey feather aerodynamic exhaust petals covering its engine nozzles. [...] This is because the petal design on the F-15 was problematic and could fall off in flight; therefore they were removed, resulting in a 3% aerodynamic drag increase.|$|E
2500|$|Pander {{followed}} their first aircraft, the small, single-seat monoplane Pander D with a two-seat, low-powered biplane for club and training use. The Pander E {{was a true}} sesquiplane, with a lower wingspan exactly half that of the upper span; in plan, though not in detailed construction the lower wing was almost a half scale copy of the upper wing, the two maximum chords being in the ratio of 0.52 and the <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> 0.23. [...] The wings were entirely of wooden construction, apart from part of their covering. [...] The upper plane was built around two box spars with spruce flanges and plywood webs. [...] From the leading edge to behind the forward spar the covering was three-ply, with fabric aft. [...] There were ailerons only on this upper wing. [...] The narrower lower wings were of similar construction but used only a single box spar, though this was extended into a larger D-box by ply skinning forward around the leading edge. [...] The wings were arranged so that the rear spar of the upper one was vertically above the single lower wing spar and the aft member of the V-form interplane struts was correspondingly vertical, with the forward member reaching forward to the forward upper spar. These Vs leaned outwards, their base on the lower wing strengthened with a further single strut to the upper fuselage longeron. The upper wing, built in two pieces, was held high above the fuselage by four cabane struts to the front spar and two more to the aft; the wings were pin-jointed to them.|$|E

Methods: Published anatomy references and atlases were reviewed and discrepancies resolved by examination of anatomic specimens and multi-planar reformatted images to describe transverse CT anatomy of lumbosacral region paraspinal muscles. Sixteen Belgian malinois military working dogs were retrospectively recruited and assigned to lumbosacral pain positive versus negative groups based on medical record entries. A single observer unaware of dog group measured CT transverse areas of paraspinal muscles and adjacent vertebral bodies, in triplicate, for L 5 -S 1 vertebral locations. A statistician compared muscle transverse <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> and asymmetry at each vertebral location between groups. Results: The relative co-efficient of variation for triplicate CT area measurements averaged 2. 15 % (N= 16). Multifidus lumborum (L 6 - 7), psoas/iliopsoas (L 5 - 6, L 6 - 7), and sacrocaudalis dorsalis lateralis (L 6 - 7, L 7 -S 1) transverse <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> were significantly smaller in dogs with lumbosacral pain (n= 11) vs. without lumbosacral pain (n= 5) (p< 0. 05).

Clinical relevance: Computed tomographic morphometry of lumbosacral region paraspinal muscles is a feasible objective method for use in future evidence-based research studies in working dogs. Potential future research applications include determining whether decreased paraspinal muscle <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> and/or increased paraspinal muscle asymmetry could be used as markers for preclinical lumbosacral pain in stoic dogs or risk factors for other injuries in high performance canine athletes; or determining whether core muscle strengthening exercise prescriptions for dogs with lumbosacral pain have an effect on paraspinal muscle <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> and asymmetry...|$|R
