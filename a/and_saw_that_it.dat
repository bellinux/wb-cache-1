25|$|In 2007, Stoltenberg {{went into}} more detail {{about how she}} {{started out as a}} drug addict, to TV {{journalist}} Tonje Steinsland–the second time her life as an addict {{was the subject of a}} television special. It started in 1991, when she was 27. She witnessed two drug addicts in a fight in a cafe in Oslo when something fell out of the pocket of one of them. She picked it up <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was heroin. Together with her boyfriend she went home and decided to snort the drug. For the next three years she was an intravenous drug user. By the end of the 1990s, she was close to dying. In the interview, Stoltenberg also tells of a boyfriend who subjected her to punishments, psychological terror and much fear, however, the heroin turned all of that into a feeling of freedom and made her perceive their relationship as simply wonderful, for a while.|$|E
25|$|The {{weight of}} the falling men pulled Hudson and Douglas from their holds and dragged them down the north face. The Taugwalders and Whymper were left alive when the rope linking Douglas to the elder Taugwalder broke. They were stunned by the {{accident}} {{and for a time}} could not move until the younger Taugwalder descended to enable them to advance. When they were together Whymper asked to see the broken rope <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been employed by mistake as it was the weakest and oldest of the three ropes they had brought. They frequently looked, but in vain, for traces of their fallen companions. They continued their descent, including an hour in the dark, until 9.30 p.m. when a resting place was found. At daybreak the descent was resumed and the group finally reached Zermatt, where a search of the victims was quickly organized. The bodies of Croz, Hadow and Hudson were found on the Matterhorn Glacier, but the body of Douglas was never found. Although the elder Taugwalder was accused of cutting the rope to save himself and his son, the official inquest found no proof of this.|$|E
25|$|One such {{story is}} that of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah’s, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi {{answered}} only that {{he be able to}} join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophet’s actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the man’s wall <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.|$|E

At the time she {{dismissed}} it, but then checked the page {{near the end of}} her workday <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had received around 5,000 notes in that time, which she said [...] "is insanely viral [...] ". Tom Christ, Tumblr's director of data, said at its peak the page was getting 14,000 views a second (or 840,000 views per minute), well over the normal rates for content on the site. By later that night, the number of total notes had increased tenfold.|$|E
2500|$|Edgartown Police Chief James Arena {{arrived at}} the scene about 10 or 15 minutes later. After {{attempting}} unsuccessfully to examine {{the interior of the}} submerged vehicle, Arena summoned a commercial diver along with equipment capable of towing or winching the vehicle out of the water. Diver John Farrar arrived at 8:45 equipped with scuba gear and discovered Kopechne's body; he extricated it from the vehicle within 10 minutes. Police checked the car's license plate <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was registered to Kennedy. Kennedy was still at the pay phone by the ferry crossing and heard that his car and Kopechne's body had been discovered; he crossed back to Edgartown and went to the police station. Gargan simultaneously went to the hotel where the [...] "boiler room girls" [...] were staying to inform them about the incident.|$|E
2500|$|By daybreak {{the twins}} were {{approaching}} the sacred mountain called [...] [...] They saw smoke rising from the ground, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> came from an underground chamber with a ladder extending.

[...] "We do not know who we are, and we do not know where we are going," [...] said the twins. [...] "We are fleeing for our lives." [...] "You must tell me more," [...] said Spider Woman.

2500|$|China's [...] "learn from foreigners" [...] {{programme}} quickly {{met with}} impediments. The Chinese military institutions were {{in desperate need}} of reform. Cixi's solution, under the advice of officials at court, was to purchase seven British warships. When the warships arrived in China, however, they were staffed with British sailors, all under British command. The Chinese were enraged at this [...] "international joke", negotiations broke down between the two parties, and China returned the warships to Britain, where they were to be auctioned off. Scholars sometimes attribute the failure of China's foreign programmes to Cixi's conservative attitude and old methods of thinking, and contend that Cixi would learn only so much from the foreigners, provided it did not infringe upon her own power. Under the pretext that a railway was too loud and would [...] "disturb the emperors' tombs", Cixi forbade its construction. When construction went ahead anyway in 1877 on Li Hongzhang's recommendation, Cixi asked that they be pulled by horse-drawn carts. Cixi was especially alarmed at the liberal thinking of people who had studied abroad, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> posed a new threat to her power. In 1881, Cixi put a halt to the policy of sending children abroad to study and withdrew her formerly open attitude towards foreigners.|$|E
2500|$|Even when pastoring {{his church}} in Dallas, Bosworth would hold {{meetings}} in other areas, and his ministry {{always had an}} element of praying for the sick and divine healing. [...] When his wife died in 1919, he arranged for someone to look after his children, then went started larger scale evangelistic meetings. [...] It appears the turning point for Bosworth's healing ministry were meetings in Lima, Ohio in August 1920. [...] The pastor there asked Bosworth to preach on Divine healing. [...] While Bosworth had previously believed in Divine Healing, and had prayed for the sick, he had not previously preached Divine Healing. [...] Bosworth writes {{that he went to}} the Lord and asked [...] "'suppose I preach on Healing and the people come and don't get healed?' [...] The Lord said 'If people didn't get saved, you wouldn't stop preaching the gospel.'" [...] Bosworth studied the question, prayed about it <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was God's will to heal as well as save people. [...] In the Lima meetings Bosorth stepped out on the Word, preached Divine Healing, and stated that healing of the body was {{as much a part of}} the gospel as salvation of the soul. [...] He invited the sick to come and hear the word of healing for their bodies. [...] The people responded, they were healed, and it led to more who came for salvation.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{internet}} leak of Civil War was {{a source}} of some controversy. Aaron Hale-Williams, a writer for the online publication Racket Magazine, was given a password-encoded streaming media version of the album by Fat Wreck Chords so that he could publish a review prior to its release. Hale posted the password and a link to the album stream on the music news website Punknews.org, and the album soon spread onto peer-to-peer networks after the streaming audio was converted into MP3 format. Racket Magazine Editor Jonathan Yost learned of the leak from Hale and contacted Fat Wreck Chords: [...] "He called me to tell me how good it was, and mentioned that he gave it to 'two or three' people. I scoped it on PunkNews <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was all over the place, so [...] dropped Fat a line to change the password before it got too far out of control." [...] Meanwhile, Hale had been submitting samples of his writing to Scott Heisel, Music Editor for Alternative Press and former editor for Punknews.org. Heisel had been covering news of Civil Wars recording and development for Alternative Press and learned of the album leak, which he called [...] "illegal...immoral and immature." [...] He contacted Fat Wreck Chords to inform them of the situation {{at about the same time}} as Yost, and learned that the Hale was the suspected source of the leak: ...|$|E
