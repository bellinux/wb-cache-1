Among the major manufacturers were Mercedes-Euklid, Archimedes, and MADAS in Europe; in the USA, Friden, Marchant, and Monroe were the principal makers of rotary calculators with carriages. Reciprocating calculators (most {{of which were}} <b>adding</b> <b>machines,</b> many with integral printers) were made by Remington Rand and Burroughs, among others. All of these were key-set.

25|$|From {{the early}} 1900s through the 1960s, {{mechanical}} calculators dominated the desktop computing market (see History of computing hardware). Major suppliers in the USA included Friden, Monroe, and SCM/Marchant. (Some comments about European calculators follow below.) These devices were motor-driven, and had movable carriages where results of calculations were displayed by dials. Nearly all keyboards were full — each digit {{that could be}} entered had its own column of nine keys, 1..9, plus a column-clear key, permitting entry of several digits at once. (See the illustration below of a Marchant Figurematic.)One could call this parallel entry, by way of contrast with ten-key serial entry that was commonplace in mechanical <b>adding</b> <b>machines,</b> and is now universal in electronic calculators. (Nearly all Friden calculators, {{as well as some}} rotary (German) Diehls had a ten-key auxiliary keyboard for entering the multiplier when doing multiplication.) Full keyboards generally had ten columns, although some lower-cost machines had eight. Most machines made by the three companies mentioned did not print their results, although other companies, such as Olivetti, did make printing calculators.|$|E

2500|$|After {{returning}} to the East Coast in 1921, Sidis was determined to live an independent and private life. He only took work running <b>adding</b> <b>machines</b> or other fairly menial tasks. He worked in New York City and became estranged from his parents. It took years before he was cleared legally to return to Massachusetts, and {{he was concerned about}} his risk of arrest for years. He obsessively collected streetcar transfers, wrote self-published periodicals, and taught small circles of interested friends his version of American history.

2500|$|Despite appearances, these {{machines}} were not simply Selectric typewriters with an RS-232 connector added. [...] As with other electric typewriters and electric <b>adding</b> <b>machines</b> of the era, Selectrics are electromechanical, not electronic, devices: The only electrical components are the power cord, power switch, and electric motor. The electric motor runs continuously. [...] The keys are not electrical pushbuttons {{such as those}} found on a computer keyboard. Pressing a key does not produce an electrical signal as output, but rather engages a series of clutches which couple the motor power to the mechanism to turn and tilt the element. A Selectric would work equally well if hand-cranked (or foot-powered, like treadle powered sewing machines) at sufficient speed.|$|E
