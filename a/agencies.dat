40|$|In this essay, Pierce and Weiss {{report the}} results of a study of {{judicial}} review of <b>agency</b> interpretations of <b>agency</b> rules. Prior studies found that, while courts at all levels uphold about 70 % of <b>agency</b> actions, the Supreme Court upholds 91 % of <b>agency</b> interpretations of <b>agency</b> rules. Pierce and Weiss find that lower courts do not confer this type of “super-deference” on <b>agency</b> interpretations of <b>agency</b> rules. District courts and circuit courts uphold 76 % of such <b>agency</b> actions. That is within the range of the findings of prior studies of judicial review of other types of <b>agency</b> actions and much lower than {{the rate at which the}} Supreme Court upholds <b>agency</b> interpretations of <b>agency</b> rules. Pierce and Weiss also find no evidence that judges are influenced by their political or ideological preferences when they review <b>agency</b> interpretations of <b>agency</b> rules. That finding is consistent with the findings of a prior study of judicial review of <b>agency</b> findings of fact, but it is inconsistent with the findings of several studies of judicial review of <b>agency</b> interpretations of agency-administered statutes and of judicial review of <b>agency</b> policy decisions...|$|R

40|$|Pivotal to {{the mutual}} shaping {{of self and}} <b>agency</b> {{is the sense of}} <b>agency,</b> or agentive self-awareness.

Building on that basis, I then turn to issues concerning the contents and structure of states of agentive self-awareness. Finally, I discuss the relation between <b>agency</b> and sense of <b>agency.</b> Is the sense of <b>agency</b> a reliable indicator of actual <b>agency?</b> Does it represent <b>agency</b> as it really is?
