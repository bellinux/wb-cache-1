25|$|As the {{temperature}} increases, an <b>amorphous</b> <b>solid</b> will become less viscous. At {{some point the}} molecules may obtain enough freedom of motion to spontaneously arrange themselves into a crystalline form. This {{is known as the}} crystallization temperature (Tc). This transition from <b>amorphous</b> <b>solid</b> to crystalline solid is an exothermic process, and results in a peak in the DSC signal. As {{the temperature}} increases the sample eventually reaches its melting temperature (Tm). The melting process results in an endothermic peak in the DSC curve. The ability to determine transition temperatures and enthalpies makes DSC a valuable tool in producing phase diagrams for various chemical systems.|$|E
25|$|Activated carbon is {{a highly}} porous, <b>amorphous</b> <b>solid</b> {{consisting}} of microcrystallites with a graphite lattice, usually prepared in small pellets or a powder. It is non-polar and cheap. One of its main drawbacks is that it reacts with oxygen at moderate temperatures (over 300nbsp&°C).|$|E
30|$|There is, however, {{disagreement}} {{on the size}} or even {{the nature of the}} clusters and fraction of interstitial space in <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids,</b> the origin of enthalpy for relaxation, the contribution of molecular geometry to the structure of <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids</b> and its relationship to relaxation, and finally the structural connection between the relaxation process and crystallization. There are possible implications of the molecular shape and packing on the size and nature of the CRRs in <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids.</b> The enthalpy relaxation is dependent on inter-CRR densification with persistent intra-CRR molecular packing such that the maximum size of CRRs is set as a limit for “stable” <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids.</b>|$|R
30|$|Professor Kenneth Morris, Long Island University, gave a {{presentation}} on {{the influence of}} molecular anisotropy on the structure and structural relaxation of <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids.</b> Dr. Morris started by stating what we know and agree on based on our current understanding of the <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids.</b> He stated that the evolution of spatial heterogeneity in <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids</b> leads to crystallization, that some characteristic cooperatively rearranging regions (CRRs) make up the solid, and that with time the solid relaxes to a more energetically favorable arrangement of molecules. He then proposed to extend the concept of molecular packing patterns to non-crystalline <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids.</b> For example, microstructures can form due to ordering based on density (toward crystallization) and bonds (toward locally preferred structures).|$|R
50|$|The stable {{liquid state}} unlike most glasses and <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids,</b> is a {{thermodynamically}} stable equilibrium state. Thus new liquid-liquid or fluid-fluid transitions {{in the stable}} liquid (or fluid) states are more easily analysed than transitions in <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids</b> where arguments are complicated by the non-equilibrium, non-ergodic nature of the amorphous state.|$|R
25|$|Glass {{transitions}} {{may occur}} {{as the temperature}} of an <b>amorphous</b> <b>solid</b> is increased. These transitions appear as {{a step in the}} baseline of the recorded DSC signal. This is due to the sample undergoing a change in heat capacity; no formal phase change occurs.|$|E
25|$|Polycrystals {{are made}} {{of a large number}} of small single crystals, or crystallites, held {{together}} by thin layers of <b>amorphous</b> <b>solid.</b> Crystal powder is obtained by grinding crystals, resulting in powder particles, made up of one or more crystallites. Both polycrystals and crystal powder consist of many crystallites with varying orientation.|$|E
25|$|A {{parameter}} {{of particular}} interest in synthetic polymer manufacturing is the glass transition temperature (Tg), at which amorphous polymers undergo a transition from a rubbery, viscous liquid, to a brittle, glassy <b>amorphous</b> <b>solid</b> on cooling. The glass transition temperature may be engineered by altering the degree of branching or crosslinking in the polymer or {{by the addition of}} plasticizer.|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} cross effects between {{mechanical}} strains and magnetic fields {{on the plastic}} response of magnetoelastic <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids.</b> It {{is well known that}} plasticity in non-magnetic <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids</b> under external strain γ is dominated by the co-dimension 1 saddle-node bifurcation in which an eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix vanishes at γ_P like √(γ_P-γ). This square-root singularity determines much of the statistical physics of elasto-plasticity, and in particular that of the stress-strain curves under athermal-quasistatic conditions. In this Letter we discuss the much richer physics that can be expected in magnetic <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids.</b> Firstly, magnetic <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids</b> exhibit co-dimension 2 plastic instabilities, when an external strain and an external magnetic field are applied simultaneously. Secondly, the phase diagrams promise a rich array of new effects that have been barely studied; this opens up a novel and extremely rich research program for magnetoplastic materials...|$|R

25|$|Examples {{of large}} {{crystals}} include snowflakes, diamonds, and table salt.

A third category of <b>solids</b> is <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids,</b> where the atoms have no periodic structure whatsoever. Examples of <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids</b> include glass, wax, and many plastics.|$|R
25|$|The term lead crystal is, by technicality, not an {{accurate}} term to describe lead glass, as glass, an <b>amorphous</b> <b>solid,</b> lacks a crystalline structure. The {{use of the}} term lead crystal remains popular for historical and commercial reasons. It is retained from the Venetian word cristallo to describe the rock crystal imitated by Murano glassmakers. This naming convention has been maintained to the present day to describe decorative hollow-ware.|$|E
25|$|When {{allowed to}} cool slowly, the molten polymer forms a more {{crystalline}} material. This material has spherulites containing many small crystallites when crystallized from an <b>amorphous</b> <b>solid,</b> rather than forming one large single crystal. Light tends to scatter as it crosses {{the boundaries between}} crystallites and the amorphous regions between them. This scattering means that crystalline PET is opaque and white in most cases. Fiber drawing is among the few industrial processes that produce a nearly single-crystal product.|$|E
25|$|Glass is an <b>amorphous</b> <b>solid.</b> It {{exhibits}} {{an atomic}} structure {{close to that}} observed in the supercooled liquid phase but displays all the mechanical properties of a solid. The notion that glass flows to an appreciable extent over {{extended periods of time}} is not supported by empirical research or theoretical analysis (see viscosity of amorphous materials). Laboratory measurements of room temperature glass flow do show a motion consistent with a material viscosity on the order of 1017–1018 Pa s.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn model <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids</b> {{produced}} via differing quench protocols, {{a strong}} correlation is established between local yield stress measured by direct local probing of shear stress thresholds and the plastic rearrangements observed during remote loading in shear. This purely local measure shows a higher predictive power for identifying sites of plastic activity when compared with more conventional structural properties. Most importantly, the sites of low local yield stress thus defined are shown to be persistent, remaining predictive of deformation events even after fifty or more such plastic rearrangements. This direct and non-perturbative approach gives access to relevant transition pathways that control the stability of <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids.</b> Our results reinforce the relevance of modeling plasticity in <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids</b> based on a gradually evolving population of discrete and local zones pre-existing in the structure...|$|R
25|$|Grain {{boundaries}} are in general {{only a few}} nanometers wide. In common materials, crystallites are large enough that grain boundaries account for {{a small fraction of}} the material. However, very small grain sizes are achievable. In nanocrystalline solids, grain boundaries become a significant volume fraction of the material, with profound effects on such properties as diffusion and plasticity. In the limit of small crystallites, as the volume fraction of grain boundaries approaches 100%, the material ceases to have any crystalline character, and thus becomes an <b>amorphous</b> <b>solid.</b>|$|E
25|$|About 60% {{crystallization}} is {{the upper}} limit for commercial products, {{with the exception of}} polyester fibers. Clear products can be produced by rapidly cooling molten polymer below Tg glass transition temperature to form an <b>amorphous</b> <b>solid.</b> Like glass, amorphous PET forms when its molecules are not given enough time to arrange themselves in an orderly, crystalline fashion as the melt is cooled. At room temperature the molecules are frozen in place, but, if enough heat energy is put back into them by heating above Tg, they begin to move again, allowing crystals to nucleate and grow. This procedure is known as solid-state crystallization.|$|E
25|$|In physics, the {{standard}} {{definition of a}} glass (or vitreous solid) is a solid formed by rapid melt quenching, although the term glass {{is often used to}} describe any <b>amorphous</b> <b>solid</b> that exhibits a glass transition temperature Tg. For melt quenching, if the cooling is sufficiently rapid (relative to the characteristic crystallization time) then crystallization is prevented and instead the disordered atomic configuration of the supercooled liquid is frozen into the solid state at Tg. The tendency for a material to form a glass while quenched is called glass-forming ability. This ability can be predicted by the rigidity theory. Generally, a glass exists in a structurally metastable state with respect to its crystalline form, although in certain circumstances, for example in atactic polymers, there is no crystalline analogue of the amorphous phase.|$|E

25|$|As {{previously}} stated, {{by adjusting}} the magnetic lenses such that the back focal plane of the lens rather than the imaging plane {{is placed on the}} imaging apparatus a diffraction pattern can be generated. For thin crystalline samples, this produces an image that consists of a pattern of dots {{in the case of a}} single crystal, or a series of rings in the case of a polycrystalline or <b>amorphous</b> <b>solid</b> material. For the single crystal case the diffraction pattern is dependent upon the orientation of the specimen and the structure of the sample illuminated by the electron beam. This image provides the investigator with information about the space group symmetries in the crystal and the crystal's orientation to the beam path. This is typically done without using any information but the position at which the diffraction spots appear and the observed image symmetries.|$|E

40|$|We derive {{expressions}} for {{the lowest}} nonlinear elastic constants of <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids</b> in athermal conditions (up to third order), {{in terms of the}} interaction potential between the constituent particles. The effect of these constants cannot be disregarded when <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids</b> undergo instabilities like plastic flow or fracture in the athermal limit; in such situations the elastic response increases enormously, bringing the system much beyond the linear regime. We demonstrate that the existing theory of thermal nonlinear elastic constants converges to our expressions in the limit of zero temperature. We motivate the calculation by discussing two examples in which these nonlinear elastic constants {{play a crucial role in}} the context of elasto-plasticity of <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids.</b> The first example is the plasticity-induced memory that is typical to <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids</b> (giving rise to the Bauschinger effect). The second example is how to predict the next plastic event from knowledge of the nonlinear elastic constants. Using the results of this paper we derive a simple differential equation {{for the lowest}} eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix in the external strain near mechanical instabilities; this equation predicts how the eigenvalue vanishes at the mechanical instability and the value of the strain where the mechanical instability takes place.

40|$|The {{yield of}} <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids</b> like {{metallic}} glasses under external stress was discussed asserting {{that it is}} related to the glass transition by increasing temperature, or that it can be understood using statistical theories of various sorts.

The yield of <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids</b> at low temperatures is a highly structured phenomenon, characterized by a specific series of mechanical instabilities, and having no similarity at all to fluidization by increased temperature, real or fictive.

40|$|<b>Amorphous</b> <b>solids</b> {{increase}} their stress {{as a function}} of an applied strain until a mechanical yield point whereupon the stress cannot increase anymore, afterwards exhibiting a steady state with a constant mean stress. In stress controlled experiments the system simply breaks when pushed beyond this mean stress. The ubiquity of this phenomenon over a huge variety of <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids</b> calls for a generic theory that is free of microscopic details. Here we offer such a theory: the mechanical yield is a thermodynamic phase transition, where yield occurs as a spinodal phenomenon. At the spinodal point there exists a divergent correlation length which is associated with the system-spanning instabilities (known also as shear bands) which are typical to the mechanical yield. The theory, the order parameter used and the correlation functions which exhibit the divergent correlation length are universal in nature and can be applied to any <b>amorphous</b> <b>solids</b> that undergo mechanical yield.
