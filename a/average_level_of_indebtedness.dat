The "t" tests on differences in means revealed that private sales tend to be associated with small woolproducing enterprises. In Western Australia, the further removed enterprises are from an auction selling centre the lower the probability of a private sale. In the Eastern States, the probability of a private sale was higher during the period of supply management in 1974 - 75, the <b>average</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness</b> to pastoral companies was lower for those enterprises from which wool was sold privately and traditional ties to wool selling brokers were apparently important in the 1974 - 75 wool selling season, although the importance of this factor diminished in 1975 - 76.

40|$|The {{expansion}} of credit markets has fostered economic growth across the European Union, {{but it has}} also produced a sharp increase in the <b>average</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> household <b>indebtedness.</b> As a consequence of the financial crisis, the drop in households’ disposable income has undermined the ability of many EU households to honour their financial commitments. Against this background, this paper investigates the complexity <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness</b> and draws a distinction between its legal and economic dimensions in order to better understand the phenomenon. Despite efforts made by the European Commission, we found that the definition <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness</b> and over-indebtedness still lacks precision. Mirroring the interventions of national legislators in terms of consumer protection, over-indebtedness in the EU tends to be narrowly defined in terms of its relationship with insolvency. Therefore, further efforts need to be taken in designing the necessary measures to alleviate and prevent over-indebtedness. Accordingly, this study focuses on the role of financial education, analyses the impact of the relevant EU directives, collects important evidence in support of harmonising debt-advice services and explores the path towards a common methodology of early detection of vulnerable households...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} performance (measured by return on assets, return on equity and profit margin) and capital structure (measured by indebtedness) in Czech manufacturing companies and how this relationship has changed {{with respect to the}} world financial crisis. In order {{to address the issue of}} heterogeneous sectors present in manufacturing industry and to provide a universally applicable conclusion, the key variables were transformed according to the percentile rank within a given manufacturing sector in a given year. The general conclusion is that the examined relationship is not the same for all <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness.</b> The relationship is positive until it reaches a certain <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness</b> and above this threshold the relationship is negative. This threshold differs across different industry sectors, time and with the usage of different performance measures.

40|$|Objectives: (1) To examine {{trends in}} <b>level</b> <b>of</b> student loan <b>indebtedness</b> for groups <b>of</b> pharmacists that were first {{licensed}} between 1980 and 2006; (2) To examine if demographic variables {{are associated with}} <b>level</b> <b>of</b> student loan indebtedness; (3) To examine the association between student loan debt and choice of practice setting while controlling for demographic variables. Methods: Data {{for this study were}} collected from a national random sample of 3, 000 pharmacists using a self administered survey. Descriptive statistics were used to examine trends in <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness.</b> The relationships between <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness,</b> demographic variables and practice setting choice were examined using Chi-square statistics. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine the independent association of student loan debt and choice of practice setting while controlling for demographic variables. Results: The proportion of licensed pharmacists reporting student loan debt after graduation, and the mean amount of debt incurred increased between 1980 and 2006. Non-white pharmacists incurred debt at a higher proportion compared to white, and they also incurred significantly higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> debt. A lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness</b> was associated with choosing independent practice over chain practice. Conclusions: Student loan indebtedness has been increasing over time, especially for non-white pharmacy students. Future research should be done to examine other factors that might influence student debt load, work contributions and choice of practice settings. The affordability of pharmacy education for students of color and how salaries may or may not help off-set these costs also should be examined closely...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{transition}} to monetary stability, we analyzed the real effort rate with the debt service for Portugal in a context of a decrease in nominal interest rates. Monthly time series data from January 1991 to September 2013 were used. The UECM of the ARDL model was applied which allowed capturing the long-run and short-run effects. The results suggest that the Portuguese reality has two distinct behaviors, one before and one after effecting monetary union. We detected the presence of different variables in explaining the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness</b> in both periods. In the first period (1991 M 1 - 1998 M 12), only financial effort is relevant when explaining the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness</b> <b>of</b> the economic agents. In the second period (1999 M 1 - 2013 M 9) the financial depth, German balance of payments and current balance and capital account are also statistically significant in the increase <b>of</b> the <b>indebtedness</b> <b>level.</b> The research supports that in the first period, the increase of financial effort reduces the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness</b> <b>of</b> the economic agents. In the second period, we have the presence of a structural break, resulting from the regime change that occurred in the economy. In this period, for a decrease of financial effort there is a reduction <b>of</b> the <b>indebtedness</b> <b>level,</b> in the long-run. The results support that there is a regime shift around 1999, whose economic nature produced an economic impact that caused indebtedness change, before and after euro introduction. For the second period (1999 M 1 - 2013 M 9) we obtained a cointegration relationship between financial effort and indebtedness. ...|$|R

This significance is well used in the analysis of structures of the capital of Tunisian businesses. Similarly, the ratio of MTB has kept its importance {{at the threshold of}} 1 % for both ratios of debt. In this regard, for the debt ratio in the long term, the negative sign of the coefficient confirms its negative impact on the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness</b> <b>of</b> Tunisian firms.

This is not surprising, given the high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness</b> <b>of</b> the Spanish families that were caught up by the housing bubble in recent years. What is more, spiralling increases in house prices have been combined with increases in home ownership (see Garriga 2010), making the situation the more unbearable in terms of mortgage obligations. Recent increases in the interest rate will definitely force those under financial stress to participate in the labour market more eagerly.|$|R

It also appears that banks became less willing to supply credit during periods associated with a deterioration in asset quality, and reduced profits due to declining regulatory protection from competition, and a need to increase capital adequacy levels. ...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the effect of a change in the {{monetary}} policy interest rate on aggregate demand may be larger at higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness</b> through its impact on cash flows. However, the extent of credit constraints may be at least as important, if not more so. In particular, monetary policy could have a larger impact on aggregate demand when credit constraints are pervasive (which could be the case at low or high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness,</b> or both). This paper examines {{the extent to which the}} strength of credit growth, which can be seen as a proxy for credit constraints, may affect the transmission of monetary policy in a way that cannot be captured in linear models. The results reveal that GDP growth is more responsive to interest rate shocks when credit growth is low. Separate models for household and business credit growth confirm this finding: consumption and business investment are more responsive to interest rate shocks when credit is growing slowly for the household and business sectors, respectively. monetary policy; business-cycle asymmetries; threshold models...|$|R

The problem <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness</b> in Croatia appeared after 1999 when public and external debt recorded accelerated growth rates. There is a danger of risk associated with the sources of funding that affects the apprehension {{about the possibility of}} future external debt servicing. However this is not only the specificity of the Croatian economy, because most Southeastern European transition countries were in a similar situation. The goal of the analysis is to compare the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness</b> in Croatia and Southeastern European countries and test the hypothesis of the paper which states that “Croatia is highly indebted country according to external debt burden and external debt flow indicators”.

40|$|In South Africa, {{studies have}} found changes in {{consumption}} and credit usage over time to be significant amongst low-income consumers. Yet, there has been limited empirical research on consumer behaviour in South Africa and even less on low-income consumerism. This study, which explores the relationship between materialism and indebtedness among a sample of low-income, instalment paying consumers of South Africa's largest catalogue retailer, aims to augment our understanding of these phenomena, whilst making some international comparisons. The study assesses whether (i) consumers display strong characteristics of materialism and (ii) whether materialism is a significant variable in predicting the consumers' propensity for incurring debt. It is concluded that low-income consumers are indeed highly materialistic. The study further suggests the presence of statistically significant relationships between consumers' <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness</b> and the demographic variables age and gender.
