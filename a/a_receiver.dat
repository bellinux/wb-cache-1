5|$|In {{order to}} be effective, costly signals must fulfill {{specific}} criteria. Firstly, signallers must incur different levels of cost and benefit for signalling behaviour. Secondly, costs and benefits must reflect the signallers’ phenotypic quality. Thirdly, the information provided by a signal should be directed at and accessible to an audience. <b>A</b> <b>receiver</b> can be anyone who stands to benefit from information the signaller is sending, such as potential mates, allies, or competitors. Honesty is guaranteed when only individuals of high quality can pay the (high) costs of signalling. Hence, costly signals {{make it impossible for}} low-quality individuals to fake a signal and fool <b>a</b> <b>receiver.</b>|$|E

5|$|Callender's true success, however, was in {{the passing}} game, where he accrued 92yards, putting him first among all {{receivers}} in the game. Callender's 13catches were an ACC Championship Game record and were the fourth-highest total for <b>a</b> <b>receiver</b> in any game in ACC history. Wide receiver Kevin Challenger finished the game with 4catches for 45yards, while the Eagles' Rich Gunnell finished the game with 54yards. Surprisingly {{for the number of}} receiving yards recorded by the Eagles in the game, no Boston College receiver caught a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{different}} receivers {{caught at}} least one pass, with Dexton Fields leading all receivers in the game with sevencatches for 101yards. Both totals were the highest marks recorded in the game by either team. Fields was also the recipient of a play that tied for the longest pass play of the game, a 37-yard toss from Reesing halfway through the third quarter. Cornerback and game MVP Aqib Talib came into the game as <b>a</b> <b>receiver</b> several times, but because his appearance in the game was such an unusual occurrence, the Virginia Tech defense was able {{to zero in on}} him and prevent him from catching the ball.|$|E
5|$|Hemingway posted {{his first}} 100-yard {{reception}} game, first two-touchdown performance and a career-high five-reception {{effort in the}} September 5 season opener for the 2009 team against Western Michigan, during his third career start.

5|$|Over {{the next}} two seasons, Jones {{developed}} into a star flanker, a position he helped invent. He was both a running threat and <b>a</b> <b>receiver</b> – his tall stature was well-suited to receiving – and helped complement a passing attack that featured the Browns' two main ends, Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie. Jones often went in motion behind {{the line of scrimmage}} before the snap at a time when few players did so, causing confusion and mismatches on defense. He had 312 rushing yards and 241 receiving yards in 1949, when the Browns won another AAFC championship.|$|E

Propaganda and speeches were typical radio fare immediately after the seizure of power, but as time went on Goebbels insisted that more music be played so that listeners would not turn to foreign broadcasters for entertainment.|$|E
5|$|The {{defensive}} backfield, {{often called}} the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S). Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS). Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, typically opposite of <b>a</b> <b>receiver</b> {{so as to be}} able to cover him, while safeties line up between the cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary. Safeties are the last line of defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.|$|E
