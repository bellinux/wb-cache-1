5|$|In 1952, Alexander S. Douglas created OXO, <b>a</b> <b>software</b> <b>program</b> for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) computer, which simulates {{a game of}} tic-tac-toe. The EDSAC was one of {{the first}} stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and filled an entire room; it {{included}} three 35×16 dot matrix cathode ray tubes to graphically display the state of the computer's memory. As a part of a thesis on human–computer interaction, Douglas used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game. The player entered input using a rotary telephone controller, selecting which of the nine squares on the board they wished to move next. Their move would appear on the screen, and then the computer's move would follow. The game was not available to the general public, and was only available to be played in the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory, by special permission, as the EDSAC could not be moved. Like other early video games, after serving Douglas's purpose, the game was discarded. Around the same time, Strachey expanded his draughts program for another mainframe computer, the Manchester Mark 1, culminating in a version for the Ferranti Mark 1 in 1952, which had a CRT display. Like OXO, the display was mostly static, updating only when a move was made. OXO and Strachey's draughts program are the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen.|$|E

For example, Eclipse Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) [9] provides a model-driven approach to generating graphical editors in Eclipse from a meta-model. The meta-model can be also implemented directly as <b>a</b> dedicated <b>software</b> <b>program</b> using <b>a</b> <b>software</b> <b>programming</b> language, such as Java. Our requirements management meta-model can be, and has been, implemented as a spreadsheet template in Microsoft Excel application.|$|R

25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1950s, {{electronic}} music and electronic visual art have co-existed in the same digital medium (Campen 2007, Collopy 2000, Jewanski & Sidler 2006, Moritz 2003). Since that time, the interaction of these fields of art has increased tremendously. Nowadays, students of art and music have digital software at their disposal that uses both musical and visual imagery. Given the capability of the Internet to publish and share digital productions, {{this has led to}} an enormous avalanche of synesthesia-inspired art on the Internet (Campen 2007) (cf. website RhythmicLight.com on the history of visual music). For instance, Stephen Malinowski and Lisa Turetsky from Berkeley, California wrote <b>a</b> <b>software</b> <b>program,</b> entitled the , that translates and shows music pieces in colored measures.|$|E
25|$|Primitives. What is the {{underlying}} framework {{used to represent}} knowledge? Semantic networks {{were one of the}} first knowledge representation primitives. Also, data structures and algorithms for general fast search. In this area there is a strong overlap with research in data structures and algorithms in computer science. In early systems the Lisp programming language which was modeled after the lambda calculus was often used as a form of functional knowledge representation. Frames and Rules were the next kind of primitive. Frame languages had various mechanisms for expressing and enforcing constraints on frame data. All data in frames are stored in slots. Slots are analogous to relations in entity-relation modeling and to object properties in object-oriented modeling. Another technique for primitives is to define languages that are modeled after First Order Logic (FOL). The most well known example is Prolog but there are also many special purpose theorem proving environments. These environments can validate logical models and can deduce new theories from existing models. Essentially they automate the process a logician would go through in analyzing a model. Theorem proving technology had some specific practical applications in the areas of software engineering. For example, it is possible to prove that <b>a</b> <b>software</b> <b>program</b> rigidly adheres to a formal logical specification.|$|E
500|$|For n {{individual}} sequences, {{the naive}} method requires constructing the n-dimensional {{equivalent of the}} matrix formed in standard pairwise sequence alignment. The search space thus increases exponentially with increasing n and is also strongly dependent on sequence length. Expressed with the big O notation commonly used to measure computational complexity, a naïve MSA takes O(LengthNseqs) time to produce. [...] To find the global optimum for n sequences this way {{has been shown to}} be an NP-complete problem. [...] In 1989, based on Carrillo-Lipman Algorithm, Altschul introduced a practical method that uses pairwise alignments to constrain the n-dimensional search space. [...] In this approach pairwise dynamic programming alignments are performed on each pair of sequences in the query set, and only the space near the n-dimensional intersection of these alignments is searched for the n-way alignment. The MSA program optimizes the sum of all of the pairs of characters at each position in the alignment (the so-called sum of pair score) and has been implemented in <b>a</b> <b>software</b> <b>program</b> for constructing multiple sequence alignments.|$|E

Twenty-three female students and twenty male students participated in the study, during which students received instruction on using Microsoft Access, <b>a</b> new <b>software</b> <b>program</b> for them. Students completed a Microsoft Access assessment to determine if there was a gender disparity in student knowledge and skill level in using Access. They also took pre and post attitude surveys to determine their attitudes toward computer use in general and toward the Microsoft Access learning experience. The results indicate there is not a gender disparity associated with attitudes about computer use in general or proficiency with using <b>a</b> new <b>software</b> <b>program,</b> but there may be a slight gender disparity associated with attitudes toward learning <b>a</b> new <b>software</b> <b>program.</b> Males reported feeling slightly more confident about using a ne...|$|R

500|$|Investigations {{were held}} in various states, {{including}} Arkansas, Michigan, and Missouri, which led to lawsuits that accused brokers of illegally reselling tickets from the Best of Both Worlds Tour. [...] "When you allow the hijacking of the market, it's literally the worst of both worlds. You get charged too much, and there's no access for the locals", said Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon. Numerous ticket brokers accessed tickets prior to fans {{as a result of}} <b>a</b> <b>software</b> <b>program</b> by RMG Technologies Inc, which permitted its clients to circumvent Ticketmaster.com's CAPTCHA access controls, and use the copyrighted website in a manner that violated the site's [...] "Terms of Use". Ticketmaster took legal action against RMG Technologies via the United States District Court for the Central District of California, claiming that the developed software for ticket brokers illegally [...] "allows them to cut in line". RMG Technologies representative denied the allegations and said they should not be held accountable because Ticketmaster is getting still paid for the tickets. [...] "This may be the only time in history that any seller sued its customers for paying them too much money", the attorney for RMG Technologies wrote in court documents.|$|E
500|$|Only a few {{assets from}} Resident Evil 1.5 could be recycled, as the {{principal}} locations in the final build were made to look more extravagant and artistic, based on photographs taken of the interiors of Western-style buildings in Japanese cities. These environments were created with <b>a</b> <b>software</b> <b>program</b> called O2, and each background took {{two to three weeks}} to render. The maximum number of zombies displayed on the screen at one time was limited to seven, making it possible to use 450 polygons for the comparatively detailed models of Leon and Claire. The protagonists, instead of being given visible wounds, were made to limp slowly upon receiving heavy damage. Apart from the graphics, {{one of the most important}} new features was the [...] "Zapping System", which was partly inspired by Back to the Future Part II, a time travel-themed film sequel that offers a different perspective on the story of the original film. The voice-overs by the all-Canadian cast of Resident Evil 2 were recorded before the actual cutscenes were completed, with each of the actors selected from a roster of ten people per role. Thereafter, the full-motion videos (FMVs) were created by filming stop motion animations of action figures, which were then rendered to completed pictures with computer graphics (CG) tools. Ada's movie model could not be finished in time. Thus, she is the only main character not to appear in a pre-rendered cutscene.|$|E
