500|$|The Wonderwall {{score was}} Harrison's first {{opportunity}} to compose extensively for a single project. He later described how he went about preparing the music: [...] "I had a regular wind-up stopwatch <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> the film to 'spot-in' the music with the watch. I wrote the timings down in my book, then I'd go to , make up a piece, record it." [...] As with his songs for the Beatles over this period, including [...] "Within You Without You" [...] and [...] "Blue Jay Way", he composed mainly on keyboard instruments such as piano or organ, rather than guitar. In addition to the Indian pieces, Harrison wrote and arranged selections in Western musical styles. In some cases, these pieces were outlined to the musicians at the recording session by Harrison, on guitar, and they then improvised on his ideas. With other selections, he first made a demo, which the musicians followed.|$|E
500|$|In September 1941, Presley entered {{first grade}} at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his {{instructors}} regarded him as [...] "average". He {{was encouraged to}} enter a singing contest after impressing his schoolteacher with a rendition of Red Foley's country song [...] "Old Shep" [...] during morning prayers. The contest, held at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, was his first public performance. Ten-year-old Presley was dressed as a cowboy; he stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang [...] "Old Shep". He recalled placing fifth. A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday; he had hoped for something else—by different accounts, either a bicycle or a rifle. Over the following year, he received basic guitar lessons from two of his uncles and the new pastor at the family's church. Presley recalled, [...] "I took the guitar, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> people, and I learned {{to play a little}} bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very shy about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} in this cottage that the first dawnings of the Jungle Books came to Kipling: [...] " [...] [...] {{workroom}} in the Bliss Cottage was seven feet by eight, and from December to April, the snow lay level with its window-sill. It chanced that I had written a tale about Indian Forestry work which included a boy who had been brought up by wolves. In the stillness, and suspense, of the winter of ’92 some memory of the Masonic Lions of my childhood's magazine, and a phrase in Haggard's Nada the Lily, combined with the echo of this tale. After blocking out the main idea in my head, the pen took charge, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> it begin to write stories about Mowgli and animals, which later grew into the two Jungle Books [...] ". With Josephine's arrival, Bliss Cottage was felt to be congested, so eventually the couple bought land — [...] on a rocky hillside overlooking the Connecticut River — from Carrie's brother Beatty Balestier and built their own house.|$|E
