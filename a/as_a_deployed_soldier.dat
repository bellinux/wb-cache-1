5000|$|The Flat Daddy concept {{dates back}} to at least 2003, when Cindy Sorenson of Bismarck, North Dakota created a cutout of her husband who was {{deployed}} in Iraq with the North Dakota National Guard.

The idea was shared by Sorenson with Elaine Dumler, a motivational speaker who mentioned the idea in a book offering coping tips for families with <b>a</b> <b>deploying</b> <b>soldier.</b> Dumler obtained <b>a</b> trademark on the term [...] "Flat Daddy", hoping to prevent anyone from profiting on the idea. Dumler filed for the trademark on October 16, 2006, for use as photographs of active duty military personnel mounted on cardboard cut-outs, vinyl, and photo paper and in books {{in the field of}} military family readiness.

40|$|This Master's thesis called Problems of resocialization of {{soldiers}} returning back from deployments offers {{an insight into}} the problems {{of soldiers}} of the Army of the Czech Republic. It deals with the integration of soldiers into society after their tour of duty. Soldiers are exposed to stressful situations during their deployments. Similarly, the deployment is demanding for a soldier's family. That is why soldiers can face problems during resocialization after coming back from deployments. The thesis is divided into several parts. The theoretical part deals with the history and the present of the Army of the Czech Republic deployments, the public's view of deployments, the training of soldiers before deployments. Next chapter deals with motivational factors of a soldier, what the requirements and duties of the soldier are and what {{the care of the}} soldier is prior, during and after deployment. It defines what a deployment is all about, what stress, trauma, and post traumatic stress disorder are. It then describes interpersonal relationships in <b>a</b> <b>deployed</b> <b>soldier's</b> environment and the <b>deployed</b> <b>soldier's</b> family, and specifies the resocialization of <b>a</b> <b>deployed</b> <b>soldier.</b> The aim of the thesis was to find out whether the resocialization of a professional soldier after coming back from deployment is problematic. One research question was raised: What are the problems of resocialization of a soldier after coming back from deployment? The sample of the study consisted of 9 communication partners, including 6 men and 3 women. All communication partners were ACR soldiers. The sample was selected using the snowball method. The prerequisite was at least one deployment. The qualitative research strategy was chosen to achieve the goal of this thesis. Semi-structured interviews were used as data source. The interviews were written down and then analyzed using open and axial coding. The research has shown that each soldier needs a different time to adapt to everyday life. The biggest problem was the return to the family, especially to the children. More problems arise after returning from a combat zone such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> response to noise and alertness. It was also found that soldiers would appreciate the possibility of longer leave after returning from deployment and positive reception by the public. None of the soldiers needed professional assistance after returning from deployment. The thesis could be beneficial to military psychologists, chaplains, and commanders. It could serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> focus on preventing problems after returning from deployments. It can also provide information on the ACR and deployments to lay and professional public...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedLandmines {{continue to be}} a threat to both military and civilian communities throughout the world. Current methods of detection, while better than nothing, could certainly be improved. Seismic SONAR is a promising new technology that may help save countless lives. The goal of this thesis was to advance Seismic SONAR development by introducing a mobile source which could be easily used in practical applications. A small tracked vehicle with dual inertial mass shakers mounted on top was used for a source. The source accurately transmitted the shaker signal into the ground, and its mobility made it a practical choice for field operations. It excited Rayleigh waves, as desired, but also generated undesirable P-waves and was not found to be directional. It proved incapable of finding a target. Improvements, such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>deploying</b> <b>an</b> array of mobile sources and a stronger source, should vastly enhance the performance of such tracked vehicles in seismic SONAR mine detection and should be pursued.

At the Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) level this maintenance process is crucial <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>deployed</b> SDS evolves quickly when services are added, modified or dropped. Knowledge-based approaches, based on manually written grammars or inference rules, are often preferred as system designers can modify directly the SLU models in order to take into account such a modification in the service, even if no or very little related data has been collected. However as new examples are added to the annotated corpus, corpus-based methods can then be applied, replacing or in addition to the initial knowledge-based models.
