5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Flash</b> Flood of Colour is {{the third}} studio album by English rock band Enter Shikari, and was {{produced}} by Dan Weller. The album was recorded in May and June 2011 at Karma Sound Studios in Bang Saray, Thailand, and at the Fortress in London, United Kingdom.

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>flashing</b> amber {{indication}} is {{a warning}} signal. In the United Kingdom, <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> amber light is used only at pelican crossings, {{in place of the}} combined red-amber signal, and indicates that drivers may pass if no pedestrians are on the crossing.|$|R
50|$|Where {{a signal}} aspect {{incorporates}} <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> lamp, the flashing lamp is always applied to less restrictive signals. This {{is to prevent}} <b>a</b> stuck <b>flashing</b> relay from accidentally upgrading the signal.|$|R
5000|$|In {{some parts}} of Canada, <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> green (known as Advanced Green) light signals {{permission}} for a left turn before the opposing traffic is allowed to enter the intersection, i.e., oncoming traffic is facing a RED light. Similarly, <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> green may be an Extended Green, for left turns after the opposing traffic's full green phase. The flashing light may be a [...] "full" [...] green, or a green left arrow, both meaning the same thing. At least one traffic light in Montreal (on the Island of Montreal, 'Right-on-Red' is not allowed), has <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> right-turn arrow, indicating that the pedestrian crossing has a red light, so {{it is safe to}} turn right and drive across it. At some intersections in Winnipeg, Manitoba, <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> green right-turn arrow appears with a red light when traffic from the right has <b>a</b> green <b>flashing</b> left-turn arrow and is not allowed to make a U-turn. In other parts of the same country (e.g., Vancouver) <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> green light conveys a very different meaning: the crossing road has stop signs with no lights of its own, and oncoming traffic also has <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> green, not <b>a</b> red stop-light. This functions the same as a European [...] "priority" [...] sign (a yellow-and-white diamond shaped sign indicating that the current street is a Priority or [...] "main" [...] road, which cross streets must yield to at uncontrolled junctions, opposite to the usual arrangement in many European countries), {{for which there is no}} direct equivalent in North America.|$|R
5|$|Downcutting and canyon {{widening}} continue {{today as}} the process of erosion continues to try to reduce the topography to sea level. In 1998 <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> flood temporarily increased the Virgin River's flow rate from 200 to 4,500ft³/s (6 to 125m³/s). Geologists estimate that the Virgin River can cut another thousand feet (300m) before it loses the ability to transport sediment to the Colorado River to the south. However, additional uplift will probably increase this figure.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, the British forces {{landed on}} the island and told the keeper's wife, Thankful Stone, that they had nothing to fear as long as they kept the light burning. Later, the keeper, Solomon Stone, had to put the light out per order of the New London customs inspector. The British {{threatened}} to blow up the lighthouse, and Stone got an order to relight the lighthouse. In 1856, the light was upgraded from the twelve lamps to a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The light's new characteristic was a fixed light with <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> every two seconds. Around 1976, a GE 1000-watt bulb was used. When the lighthouse was repaired after the fire and automated in 1978, a modern optic replaced the Fresnel lens. The lighthouse currently uses a VRB-25 lens. The lighthouse switched to solar power in 1988. The light's characteristic is <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> of white light every ten seconds. It continues to operate as a navigational aid to the nearby Intracoastal Waterway.|$|E
5|$|In Jamaica, <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> {{flood warning}} {{remained}} {{in effect for}} flood-prone regions for four days, ultimately discontinued on October3. Schools and several businesses, including the US Embassy in Kingston, closed on September2930 as the island braced for heavy rains. Public transit was suspended islandwide {{on the evening of}} September29, and shipping interests were cautioned to secure their vessels. At the height of the storm, army and police officials patrolled the island in case of emergencies.|$|E
50|$|Washington state, {{particularly}} Seattle, used <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> yellow ball in {{the left}} turn signal for the same purpose. Seattle also used a 4-lamp signal at about 20 locations, with a red ball, a steady yellow ball, <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> yellow ball, and a dual-mode yellow and green arrow; during the permissive turn, the flashing yellow ball was displayed.|$|R

5|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} deals with current affairs (primarily the Great Recession). It confronts flaws in {{government}} action {{to end the}} global recession, also touching on the political situation in Israel and climate change. <b>A</b> <b>Flash</b> Flood of Colour demonstrated Enter Shikari's continued fusion of electronic and rock music influences. The album's cover depicts an inverted social hierarchy.|$|E

25|$|Usage of {{emergency}} vehicle lighting is restricted in the United Kingdom through the Road Vehicle Lighting Regulations 1989. It is illegal for any vehicle to show <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> colored light (with {{the exception of}} the normal direction indicators or a green anti-lock brake warning indicator), unless it is an emergency or other authorized vehicle. However recently pedal cycles can exhibit <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> rear red lamp and flashing white front lamp.|$|R

5000|$|Failures: If {{power is}} still available, <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> amber light {{is used to}} warn of an intersection. Methods to {{distinguish}} the main road from the secondary road (and hence right of way) include using yield (give way) signs, stop signs or <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> red light on the secondary road as well as written signage. In some countries including Australia, the road rules outline procedures such as giving way to the right.|$|R
50|$|The {{flashing}} yellow arrow {{was introduced}} {{not because of}} a perceived {{lack of understanding of}} the circular green. For turning drivers, there is no perceptible difference between the flashing yellow arrow and the circular green, because both mean the same thing; however, the meaning of the flashing yellow arrow is different for drivers who are not making the indicated turn. To the driver turning left, the flashing yellow arrow means exactly the same as a Yield Sign, and <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> red arrow means exactly the same as a Stop sign. Left turning drivers facing <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> yellow arrow are allowed to make a left turn if there is a gap in oncoming traffic, however when facing <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> red arrow drivers must come to a complete stop before making a left turn. (However, the MUTCD requires that a traffic study be performed before installing <b>a</b> <b>flashing</b> red arrow signal) With the flashing yellow arrow or flashing red arrow, opposing straight-ahead traffic has a circular green at the same time. With the steady green arrow, opposing traffic must have a circular red.|$|R
