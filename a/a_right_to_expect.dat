2500|$|Faced with {{choosing}} between British interests and Iran, the U.S. chose Britain, Gasiorowski said. [...] "Britain {{was the closest}} ally of the United States, and the two countries were working as partners {{on a wide range}} of vitally important matters throughout the world at this time. Preserving this close relationship was more important to U.S. officials than saving Mosaddeq's tottering regime." [...] A year earlier, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill used Britain's support for the U.S. in the Cold War to insist the United States not undermine his campaign to isolate Mosaddegh.

2500|$|The United Kingdom {{took its}} anti-nationalisation case against Iran to the International Court of Justice at The Hague; PM Mosaddegh said {{the world would}} learn of a [...] "cruel and imperialistic country" [...] {{stealing}} from a [...] "needy and naked people". The court ruled {{that it had no}} jurisdiction over the case. Nevertheless, the British continued to enforce the embargo of Iranian oil. In August 1952, Iranian Prime Minister Mosaddegh invited an American oil executive to visit Iran and the Truman administration welcomed the invitation. However, the suggestion upset Churchill who insisted that the U.S. not undermine his campaign to isolate Mosaddegh: [...] "Britain was supporting the Americans in Korea, he reminded Truman, and had <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> Anglo-American unity on Iran." ...|$|E

Several are essential for all student journalists,but others are more vital for those who, like me, suffer from permanently itchy feet and wish to practise their craft in foreign climes. In either case my belief is that, in today’s new e-world,journalism educators should still be teaching the basic journalism skills that are of practical use in the marketplace, they should not show an exaggerated interest in the PhD research that attracts so much coveted university funding, and they must try to put the interests and needs of their students first. I am fully aware of the academic debate raging between those who think that university journalism courses should be educating young people in a broad sense and others who believe these courses should provide youngsters with practical skills the profession can use. Both are valid, but I believe young people studying journalism have <b>a</b> perfect <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> they will leave equipped with skills to find a job in an increasingly competitive environment...|$|R
5000|$|Carr {{received}} an appointment as professor to the University of Wisconsin in 1855 — his title was Chair of Natural Sciences, {{and he also}} was to teach a course in agricultural science. He was the eighth member of the faculty, {{and at the time}} this was considered by the regents to fill the needs. The university was new, and as a lobbying ploy to enhance legislative and public support, Carr and Daniel Read were inaugurated in a ceremony in the Assembly hall. Carr used the occasion to outline his educational philosophies, and throughout his time in Madison he continued to push for emphasis on practical relevancy of the coursework offered by the university. [...] "The public have <b>a</b> reasonable <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> ... that these departments connect the University directly with the industrial interests of the State, by affording instruction to young men, in Agriculture, Mining, etc...." [...] Like many academics at the university, he immediately became involved with the state historical society. He was {{also a member of the}} State Geological Survey and served as a university regent from 1857-1859. Outspoken and at times at odds with his colleagues, in 1867 Carr lost his faculty position during a general turnover due to reforms instituted by new university president Paul A. Chadbourne.|$|R
60|$|In my opinion, {{it is our}} duty, when we {{have the}} desires of the people before us, to pursue them, not in the spirit of literal obedience, which may militate with their very principle,--much less to treat them with a peevish and {{contentious}} litigation, as if we were adverse parties in a suit. It would, Sir, be most dishonorable for a faithful representative of the Commons to take advantage of any inartificial expression of the people's wishes, in order to frustrate their attainment of what they have <b>an</b> undoubted <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect.</b> We are under infinite obligations to our constituents, who have raised us to so distinguished a trust, and have imparted such a degree of sanctity to common characters. We ought to walk before them with purity, plainness, and integrity of heart,--with filial love, and not with slavish fear, which is always a low and tricking thing. For my own part, in what I have meditated upon that subject, I cannot, indeed, take upon me to say I have the honor to follow the sense of the people. The truth is, I met it on the way, while I was pursuing their interest according to my own ideas. I am happy beyond expression to find that my intentions have so far coincided with theirs, that I have not had, cause to be in the least scrupulous to sign their petition, conceiving it to express my own opinions, as nearly as general terms can express the object of particular arrangements.|$|R

60|$|As my pen {{finishes}} these passages, I can but be amused {{to think}} what a terrible hubbub would have been made (in truth was made) about any similar expressions of opinion {{a quarter of a}} century ago. In fact, the contrast between the present condition of public opinion upon the Darwinian question; between the estimation in which Darwin's views are now held in the scientific world; between the acquiescence, or at least quiescence, of the theologians of the self-respecting order at the present day and the outburst of antagonism on all sides in 1858-9, when the new theory respecting the origin of species first became known to the older generation to which I belong, is so startling that, except for documentary evidence, I should be sometimes inclined to think my memories dreams. I have a great respect for the younger generation myself (they can write our lives, and ravel out all our follies, if they choose to take the trouble, by and by), and I should be glad to be assured that the feeling is reciprocal; but I am afraid that the story of our dealings with Darwin may prove a great hindrance to that veneration for our wisdom which I should like them to display. We have not even the excuse that, thirty years ago, Mr. Darwin was an obscure novice, who had no claims on our attention. On the contrary, his remarkable zoological and geological investigations had long given him an assured position among the most eminent and original investigators of the day; while his charming 'Voyage of a Naturalist' had justly earned him a wide-spread reputation among the general public. I doubt if there was any man then living who had <b>a</b> better <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> that anything he might choose to say on such a question as the Origin of Species would be listened to with profound attention, and discussed with respect; and there was certainly no man whose personal character should have afforded a better safeguard against attacks, instinct with malignity and spiced with shameless impertinences.|$|R
40|$|In a {{landmark}} non-decision last term, five Justices of the United States Supreme Court would {{have held that}} citizens possess <b>a</b> Fourth Amendment <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> that certain quantities of information about them will remain private, {{even if they have}} no such expectations with respect to any of the information or data constituting that whole. This quantitative approach to evaluating and protecting Fourth Amendment rights is certainly novel and raises serious conceptual, doctrinal, and practical challenges. In other works, we have met these challenges by engaging in a careful analysis of this “mosaic theory” and by proposing that courts focus on the technologies that make collecting and aggregating large quantities of information possible. In those efforts, we focused on reasonable expectations held by “the people” {{that they will not be}} subjected to broad and indiscriminate surveillance. These expectations are anchored in Founding-era concerns about the capacity for unfettered search powers to promote an authoritarian surveillance state. Although we also readily acknowledged that there are legitimate and competing governmental and law enforcement interests at stake in the deployment and use of surveillance technologies that implicate reasonable interests in quantitative privacy, we did little more. In this Article, we begin to address that omission by focusing on the legitimate governmental and law enforcement interests at stake in preventing, detecting, and prosecuting cyber-harassment and healthcare fraud...|$|R
