Instead, Greer was repaired and upgraded to keep it close to Triple-A standards until a new stadium could be built. In late 2013, talks about {{the construction of a new}} ballpark—later called First Tennessee Park—were revived. Three possible sites were identified by the architectural firm Populous as being suitable for a new stadium: the east bank of the Cumberland River, the North Gulch area, and Sulphur Dell. Sulphur Dell, the site of the city's original ballpark from 1870 to 1963, was chosen.|$|E

The station received a small expansion that year, and a covered island platform was built between the W tracks.

5|$|In the 1960s, Wolgin began {{development}} of a two-tower high-rise complex in the West Market Street neighborhood of Philadelphia. Existing structures at the site were demolished in 1969 <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> condemned the structures using eminent domain. With the project over budget, Centre Square was redesigned just before construction was scheduled to begin. Originally intended to be two steel high rises, the redesign used concrete instead. Unlike similar projects in the city, the entire complex was constructed all at once. The US$80-million Centre Square opened in 1973 with First Pennsylvania Bank as the lead tenant. Centre Square is credited with shifting Philadelphia's downtown office district from South Broad Street to West Market Street.|$|E

5|$|Major-General Charles George Gordon {{was given}} the job of {{evacuating}} the Egyptian garrison from Khartoum. He arrived on 18 February 1884. Gordon was reluctant to abandon the population of Khartoum to {{the forces of the}} Mahdi, and also felt that by evacuating the city he would open the way for the Mahdi to threaten Egypt. He bombarded the authorities in Cairo with telegrams suggesting alternative courses, and delayed starting the evacuation. On 13 March 1884 the tribes north of Khartoum declared for the Mahdi, cutting the telegraph and blocking river traffic. Khartoum was besieged, falling on 25 January 1885 after a siege of 313 days. A relief column arrived two days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> had fallen and Gordon had been killed.
