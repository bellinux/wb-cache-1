50|$|This {{package of}} {{regulation}} implement Basel III in the European Union. Despite {{the fact that}} the new rules respect the balance and level of ambition of Basel III, there are two reasons why Basel III cannot simply be copy/pasted into EU legislation and, therefore, a faithful implementation of the Basel III framework shall be assessed having regard to the substance of the rules. First, Basel III is not a law. It is the latest configuration of an evolving set of internationally agreed standards developed by supervisors and central banks. That has to now go through a process of democratic control as it is transposed into EU and national law. Furthermore, while the Basel capital adequacy agreements apply to 'internationally active banks', in <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> it has applied to all banks (more than 8,300) as well as investment firms. This wide scope is necessary in <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> since banks authorised in one Member State can provide their services <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>EU's</b> single market (known as 'EU banking passport') and as such are more than likely to engage in cross-border business.|$|R

Some secularists in Turkey envisage that the accession of Turkey will contribute to the spread of secular western values in Turkey. Conversely, some non-secularists in Turkey envisage that accession will contribute to the further growth and acceptance of Islam in Europe. The EU accession bid has stimulated Turkey's political and legal reforms and intensified the democratisation process.|$|E

25|$|The European Union's Executive Commission {{proposed}} a European Union-wide anti-racism law in 2001, but European Union states failed {{to agree on}} the balance between prohibiting racism and freedom of expression. An attempt to ban the swastika <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> in early 2005 failed after objections from the British Government and others. In early 2007, while Germany held the European Union presidency, Berlin proposed that the European Union should follow German Criminal Law and criminalize the denial of the Holocaust and the display of Nazi symbols including the swastika, which is based on the Ban on the Symbols of Unconstitutional Organizations Act. This led to an opposition campaign by Hindu groups across Europe against a ban on the swastika. They pointed out that the swastika has been around for 5,000 years as a symbol of peace.
