5|$|De-icers spray heated {{de-icing}} fluid, often {{propylene glycol}} or ethylene glycol, onto icy surfaces {{such as the}} bodies of <b>aircraft</b> <b>and</b> road surfaces. These prevent ice from forming {{on the body of}} the aircraft while on the ground. Ice makes the surface of the wings rougher, reducing the amount of lift they provide while increasing drag. The ice also increases the weight of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>and</b> can affect its balance.|$|E

5|$|A {{shortage}} of aircraft {{played a role}} in transporting the task force to France, which had to be divided into two large groups and a small glider group for the British. On D-Day the first large group would be transported to France by 394 <b>aircraft</b> <b>and</b> eighty gliders. A second group of 325 <b>aircraft</b> <b>and</b> 270 gliders would arrive in the afternoon. The smaller British group consisting of the 2nd Parachute Brigade's glider forces would arrive shortly after the first group in the morning. In total 9,099 troops, 221 vehicles and 213 artillery guns would be delivered to France during Operation Rugby.|$|E

5|$|Although the XB-21 {{failed to}} win a {{production}} contract, {{it was the first}} of a long line of North American Aviation medium bomber <b>aircraft,</b> <b>and</b> provided experience and knowledge that assisted in the development of the North American NA-40, which, developed into the B-25 Mitchell, would become one of the Army's standard medium bombers of World War II.|$|E
5|$|American {{aircraft}} also attacked {{several other}} ships docked at Yokosuka. The unfinished Matsu class destroyer Yaezakura broke {{in two and}} sank after being bombed, and the submarine I-372 was destroyed by another bomb; {{at the time the}} submarine's crew was ashore and did not suffer any fatalities. Two escort vessels and a torpedo boat were also sunk. In addition to these losses, five other ships, including the obsolete destroyer Yakaze and training ships Fuji and Kasuga were damaged. Despite their proximity to Nagato, Fukugawa Maru No.7 and Ushio were not damaged. The British and United States aircraft dispatched against airfields claimed to have destroyed 43 Japanese <b>aircraft</b> <b>and</b> damaged another 77. The pilots of these aircraft also claimed the destruction of several railway locomotives. Allied losses in the attacks made on 18July were 12 U.S.Navy aircraft, two Royal Navy <b>aircraft</b> <b>and</b> 18 aircrew. The Allied pilots were disappointed they had not sunk Nagato, despite the battleship being the primary target of the raid.|$|E
5|$|Announcing {{plans for}} the future of the British {{military}} on 21 July 2004, the Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon detailed plans to reduce the upgrade programme to cover only 16 MRA4 <b>aircraft,</b> <b>and</b> suggested that an eventual fleet of 12 might suffice. PA02, the second development MRA4, achieved its first flight in December 2004 and was used to test elements of the mission system and the air vehicle. BAE Systems received a contract worth Â£1.1 billion for 12 MRA4s on 18 July 2006; three were to be development <b>aircraft</b> <b>and</b> nine more converted to production standard.
