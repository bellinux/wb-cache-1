5|$|After the war, Hōshō {{served as}} a {{repatriation}} transport to retrieve Japanese servicemen and civilians stationed overseas and return them to Japan. In October and November 1945, accompanied by the cruiser Kashima, she carried 700 passengers from Wotje <b>Atoll,</b> 311 from Jaluit <b>Atoll,</b> and an undocumented number from Enewetak <b>Atoll</b> to Uraga, Kanagawa.|$|E

The islets were named by Harald Rehder and John Randall, who visited the <b>atoll</b> during an expedition by the Smithsonian Institution in 1975.|$|E

50|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>atolls</b> {{around the globe}} is instructive: most of the world's <b>atolls</b> are in the Pacific Ocean (with concentrations in the Tuamotu Islands, Caroline Islands, Marshall Islands, Coral Sea Islands, and the island groups of Kiribati, Tuvalu and Tokelau) and Indian Ocean (the <b>Atolls</b> of the Maldives, the Lakshadweep Islands, the Chagos Archipelago and the Outer Islands of the Seychelles). The Atlantic Ocean has no large groups of <b>atolls,</b> other than eight <b>atolls</b> east of Nicaragua that belong to the Colombian department of San Andres and Providencia in the Caribbean.|$|R
5|$|The convoy {{arrived at}} Addu <b>Atoll</b> {{on the evening}} of 9 February, and {{anchored}} there to refuel and take on supplies. This <b>atoll</b> served as a secret supply base for Allied vessels in the Indian Ocean, and the Australian soldiers were not told where they were while the refuelling took place. The troops were also not permitted to go ashore, but regarded the sight of the tropical <b>atoll</b> as a welcome change from the arid Middle East. After the ships were refuelled, the convoy sailed on the afternoon of 10 February.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Tokiwa and the other minelayers of the 19th Division of the 4th Fleet escorted two troop {{transports}} that carried the occupation forces for the Gilbert Islands. In January 1942, the ship participated in Operation R (the invasion of Rabaul and Kavieng) and returned to Kwajalein <b>Atoll</b> afterwards. She was damaged by American carrier aircraft in February 1942 and forced to return home for repairs. Tokiwa returned to Truk on 14 July, and reoccupied Makin <b>Atoll</b> the following month after the Makin Raid.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Parsons was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} rear admiral without ever having commanded a ship. He participated in Operation Crossroads, the nuclear weapon tests at Bikini <b>Atoll</b> in 1946, and later the Operation Sandstone tests at Enewetak <b>Atoll</b> in 1948. In 1947, he became deputy commander of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project. He {{died of a heart attack}} on 5 December 1953.|$|E

50|$|Lakshadweep is an {{archipelago}} {{of twelve}} <b>atolls,</b> three reefs and five submerged banks, {{with a total}} of about thirty-nine islands and islets. The reefs are in fact also <b>atolls,</b> although mostly submerged, with only small unvegetated sand cays above the high-water mark. The submerged banks are sunken <b>atolls.</b> Almost all the <b>atolls</b> have a northeast-southwest orientation with the islands lying on the eastern rim, and a mostly submerged reef on the western rim, enclosing a lagoon. It has 10 inhabited islands, 17 uninhabited islands, attached islets, 4 newly formed islets and 5 submerged reefs.|$|R
50|$|The Maldives has twenty-six natural <b>atolls</b> and few island {{groups on}} {{isolated}} reefs, {{all of which}} have been divided into twenty-one administrative divisions (twenty administrative <b>atolls</b> and Malé city).|$|R

5|$|Elements {{took part}} in the capture of Engebi in the Eniwetok <b>Atoll</b> on 18 February 1944, code named Operation Catchpole. Because of the speed and success of the attack on Kwajalein, the attack was {{undertaken}} several months ahead of schedule. After a week of fighting, the division secured the islands of the <b>atoll.</b> The division then returned to Hawaii to continue training. There, in June 1944, General Douglas MacArthur and President Franklin Roosevelt personally reviewed the division.|$|E

5|$|Nagato was {{selected}} to participate as a target ship in Operation Crossroads, a series of U.S. nuclear weapon tests held at Bikini <b>Atoll</b> in mid-1946. In mid-March, Nagato departed Yokosuka for Eniwetok, but her hull had not been repaired from the underwater damage sustained during the attack on 18 July and she leaked enough that her pumps could not keep up. The ship had a list of seven degrees to port by the time tugboats from Eniwetok arrived. She reached the <b>atoll</b> on 4 April and Bikini in May.|$|E

A convoy assignment took Mahan to Samoa, where she joined Task Force 17 (including the carrier , two cruisers and five destroyers). The task force carried out raids on Jaluit <b>Atoll,</b> Mili <b>Atoll</b> and Makin <b>Atoll</b> (Butaritari) in the Marshall Islands and Gilbert Islands. Mahan {{moved on to}} Canton Island in late February 1942, temporarily assigned to offshore patrol duty. By early April, she was at sea with a convoy bound for San Pedro, California.
