60|$|On {{the first}} great {{question}} that the Convention had to decide--the fate of the king--Condorcet voted on the two main issues very much as a wise man would have voted, knowing the event as we know it. He voted that the king was guilty of conspiring against liberty, and he voted for the punishment of exile in preference to that of death. On the intermediate issue, whether {{the decision of the}} Convention should be final, or should be submitted to the people for ratification, he voted as a wise man should not have done, in favour of an appeal to the people. Such an appeal must inevitably have led to violent and bloody local struggles, and laid France open to the enemy. It is a striking circumstance that, though Condorcet thus voted that the king was guilty, he had previously laid before the Convention a most careful argument to show that they were neither morally nor legally competent to try the king at all. How, he asked, without violating every principle of jurisprudence, can you act {{at the same time as}} legislators constituting the crime, as accusers, and as judges? His proposal was that Lewis XVI. should be tried by a tribunal whose jury and judges should be named by the electoral body of the departments.[34] With true respect for Condorcet's honourable anxiety that the conditions of justice should be rigorously observed--for, as he well said, 'there is no liberty in a country where positive law is not the single rule of judicial proceedings'--it is difficult to see why the Convention, coming as it did fresh from the electoral bodies, who must have had the question what was to be done with the imprisoned king foremost in their minds, why the members of the Convention should not form as legitimate a tribunal as any body whose composition and authority they had themselves defined and created, and which would be chosen by the very same persons who less than a month before had invested them with their own offices. Reading this most scrupulous and juristic composition, we might believe the writer to have forgotten that France lay mad and frenzied outside the hall where he stood, and that in political action the question what is possible is at least <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>what</b> is compatible with the maxims of scientific jurisprudence. It was to Condorcet's honour as a jurisconsult that he should have had so many scruples; it is as much to his credit as a politician that he laid them aside and tried the king after all.|$|E

It argues that ideas about leadership which are predicated upon the assumption that ‘what works’ can be identified, prescribed and replicated are at least an inadequate way of conceiving the concept and often may be inappropriate and unhelpful. It also argues that in the leadership world ‘making sense of things’ is at least <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> ‘seeking <b>what</b> works’. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, the article outlines two approaches to the conceptualization of leadership that it terms the ‘traditional’ and ‘emerging’ approaches. Second, it considers the policy context within which leadership is today located, both in education and more widely within the public sector. Third, it explores some implications that these ideas about leadership and this policy context raise for leadership and leadership development in education. Finally, it draws conclusions, identifying six dimensions of a sense-making agenda for educational leaders. </p...|$|R

This paper discusses the idea of semantic service requests for composite services, and presents a multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) based model of composite service requests.

And the politics, economy and cultural situations in these areas are different from those in their own nations. And in all of these differences, the difference between cultures is the one that has the greatest and the most direct influence on the transmission of advertisements.
