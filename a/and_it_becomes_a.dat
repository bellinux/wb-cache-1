M-60 and M-66 separate west of Union City, and M-66 turns north into Calhoun County.|$|E

But then the character gets thrust into the story in a way that his life is seriously at risk <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> little more action oriented and a little more horror movie-esque. So, he kinda bounces back between being humorous and also being real… the rest of these guys, they look really good in their suits and they've got abs, they can kick and fight and punch. Newt is sort of the 'everyman' and he's flawed and he's arrogant." [...] Del Toro gave Geiszler the mentality of a celebrity chef, with tattoos and a [...] "big personality". According to the director, Day was cast based on his performance in an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: [...] "He comes out with a stick, and he has a monologue about what it is to hunt the rats in the basement. It was very funny, but he was coming from character. He was not doing big stuff, he was, like, really mourning and lamenting his job, you know, how inhuman it is. And I thought, 'This guy is great at shading and comedy.' There are moments in the movie where he delivers them both." [...] Trek Buccino portrays Geiszler as a child.|$|E

My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back."

It was a great work environment ... <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Strain theory, {{also known}} as Mertonian Anomie, {{advanced}} by American sociologist Robert Merton, suggests that mainstream culture, especially in the United States, is saturated with dreams of opportunity, freedom, and prosperity—as Merton put it, the American Dream. Most people buy into this dream, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> powerful cultural and psychological motivation. Merton also used the term anomie, but it meant something slightly different for him than it did for Durkheim. [...] Merton saw the term as meaning a dichotomy between what society expected of its citizens and what those citizens could actually achieve. [...] Therefore, if the social structure of opportunities is unequal and prevents the majority from realizing the dream, some of those dejected will turn to illegitimate means (crime) in order to realize it. Others will retreat or drop out into deviant subcultures (such as gang members, or what he calls [...] "hobos").|$|E

6000|$|All {{who have}} killed or {{witnessed}} {{the killing of}} the puma--and I have questioned scores of hunters on this point--agree that it resigns itself in this unresisting, pathetic manner to death at the hands of man.

When a world, not yet doomed for death, is rushing down to ever-deeper Baseness and Confusion, it is a dire necessity of Nature's to bring in her Aristocracies, her Best, even by forcible methods. When their descendants or representatives cease entirely to be the Best, Nature's poor world will very soon rush down again to Baseness; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> dire necessity of Nature's to cast them out.

60|$|Again, the {{preference}} we feel for certain qualities of sound presents a like difficulty, admitting only of a like solution. It is {{generally agreed that}} the tones of the human voice are more pleasing than any others. Grant that music takes its rise from the modulations of the human voice under emotion, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> natural consequence that the tones of that voice should appeal to our feelings more than any others; and so should be considered more beautiful than any others. But deny that music has this origin, and the only alternative is the untenable position that the vibrations proceeding from a vocalist's throat are, objectively considered, {{of a higher order}} than those from a horn or a violin. Similarly with harsh and soft sounds. If the conclusiveness of the foregoing reasonings be not admitted, it must be supposed that the vibrations causing the last are intrinsically better than those causing the first; and that, in virtue of some pre-established harmony, the higher feelings and natures produce the one, and the lower the other. But if the foregoing reasonings be valid, it follows, as a matter of course, that we shall like the sounds that habitually accompany agreeable feelings, and dislike those that habitually accompany disagreeable feelings.|$|E

You will find, on consideration, the {{ultimate}} fact {{to be that}} to which I have just referred you;--my statement in [...] "Aratra," [...] {{that the idea of}} a construction originally useful is retained in good architecture, through all the amusement of its ornamentation; as the idea of the proper function of any piece of dress ought to be retained through its changes in form or embroidery. A good spire or porch retains the first idea of a roof usefully covering a space, as a Norman high cap or elongated Quaker's bonnet retains the original idea of a simple covering for the head; and any extravagance of subsequent fancy may be permitted, so long as the notion of use is not altogether lost. A girl begins by wearing a plain round hat to shade her from the sun; she ties it down over her ears on a windy day; presently she decorates the edge of it, so bent, with flowers in front, or the riband that ties it with a bouquet at the side, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> bonnet.
