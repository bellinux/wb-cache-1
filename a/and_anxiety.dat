Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the relationship between anxiety in school-age children before surgery <b>and</b> parental state-trait <b>anxiety.</b> Method: This descriptive study was performed on 81 children within the age group of 6 - 12 years admitted for elective surgical operation and 128 parents in Doctor Sheikh Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, 2016. Children's <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> parental <b>anxiety</b> were measured before the entrance of the patients to the operating room via Revised Children's Manifest <b>Anxiety</b> Scale (RCMAS) <b>and</b> Spielberger’s State-Trait <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory, respectively. The data was analyzed in SPSS, version 16, using the relevant statistical tests. Results: The results of Pearson product-moment correlation test showed a positive correlation between children's <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> fathers' state <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> between children's <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> mothers' state <b>anxiety</b> (r= 0. 27, r= 0. 41; P= 0. 005, P= 0. 040, respectively). However, no statistically significant relationship was observed between children's <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> parents' trait <b>anxiety,</b> age of children, as well as parents' educational level, occupation, and level of trait anxiety. Implications for Practice: Considering the association between parents' state <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> children's <b>anxiety,</b> implementing preoperative interventions to prepare parents for surgery is recommended...|$|R
