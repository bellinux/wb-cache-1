40|$|Mycotoxins pose a {{challenge}} to a safe food supply worldwide, and their threat is expected to worsen with our changing climate. The need for diligence is exemplified by the discovery of fumonisin B 2 in wine, which joins ochratoxin A as a mycotoxin of concern in the grape-wine chain. To elucidate the mycotoxin risk in southeastern <b>American</b> <b>wine,</b> <b>grape</b> samples were collected from vineyards during harvest in 2013 and potentially mycotoxigenic fungi (Fusarium and Aspergillus) were isolated from the samples. Numerous Fusarium isolates were recovered and identified to the species level by comparison of translation elongation factor 1 -α gene sequences to verified strains. Fusarium fujikuroi was the most abundant species recovered (239 isolates), followed by F. proliferatum (52), F. incarnatum-equiseti (14), F. oxysporum (7), F. concentricum (1), and F. solani (1). In vitro assays quantified fumonisin production for representative isolates via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Surprisingly, nearly all F. fujikuroi isolates produced fumonisins B 1, B 2, and B 3 at levels comparable to both the F. proliferatum isolates and the positive control, Fusarium verticillioides. Such capacity for fumonisin production refutes the generally accepted notion that F. fujikuroi produces undetectable or low levels of fumonisins and provides evidence to reconsider this species as a mycotoxigenic threat to economically significant crops...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{complex and}} dynamic changes during grape berry {{development}} {{have been studied}} in Vitis vinifera, but {{little is known about}} these processes in other Vitis species. The grape variety 'Norton', with a major portion of its genome derived from Vitis aestivalis, maintains high levels of malic acid and phenolic acids in the ripening berries in comparison with V. vinifera varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon. Furthermore, Norton berries develop a remarkably high level of resistance to most fungal pathogens while Cabernet Sauvignon berries remain susceptible to those pathogens. The distinct characteristics of Norton and Cabernet Sauvignon merit a comprehensive analysis of transcriptional regulation and metabolite pathways. Results A microarray study was conducted on transcriptome changes of Norton berry skin during the period of 37 to 127 days after bloom, which represents berry developmental phases from herbaceous growth to full ripeness. Samples of six berry developmental stages were collected. Analysis of the microarray data revealed that a total of 3, 352 probe sets exhibited significant differences at transcript levels, with two-fold changes between at least two developmental stages. Expression profiles of defense-related genes showed a dynamic modulation of nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) resistance genes and pathogenesis-related (PR) genes during berry development. Transcript levels of PR- 1 in Norton berry skin clearly increased during the ripening phase. As in other grapevines, genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway were up-regulated in Norton as the berry developed. The most noticeable was the steady increase of transcript levels of stilbene synthase genes. Transcriptional patterns of six MYB transcription factors and eleven structural genes of the flavonoid pathway and profiles of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins (PAs) during berry skin development were analyzed comparatively in Norton and Cabernet Sauvignon. Transcriptional patterns of MYB 5 A and MYB 5 B were similar during berry development between the two varieties, but those of MYBPA 1 and MYBPA 2 were strikingly different, demonstrating that the general flavonoid pathways are regulated under different MYB factors. The data showed that there were higher transcript levels of the genes encoding flavonoid- 3 '-O-hydroxylase (F 3 ' H), flavonoid- 3 ', 5 '-hydroxylase (F 3 ' 5 'H), leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX), UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3 '-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT), anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) 1 and LAR 2 in berry skin of Norton than in those of Cabernet Sauvignon. It was also found that the total amount of anthocyanins was markedly higher in Norton than in Cabernet Sauvignon berry skin at harvest, and five anthocyanin derivatives and three PA compounds exhibited distinctive accumulation patterns in Norton berry skin. Conclusions This study provides an overview of the transcriptome changes and the flavonoid profiles in the berry skin of Norton, an important North <b>American</b> <b>wine</b> <b>grape,</b> during berry development. The steady increase of transcripts of PR- 1 and stilbene synthase genes likely contributes to the developmentally regulated resistance during ripening of Norton berries. More studies are required to address the precise role of each stilbene synthase gene in berry development and disease resistance. Transcriptional regulation of MYBA 1, MYBA 2, MYB 5 A and MYBPA 1 as well as expression levels of their putative targets F 3 ' H, F 3 ' 5 ' H, LDOX, UFGT, ANR, LAR 1, and LAR 2 are highly correlated with the characteristic anthocyanin and PA profiles in Norton berry skin. These results reveal a unique pattern of the regulation of transcription and biosynthesis pathways underlying the viticultural and enological characteristics of Norton grape, and yield new insights into the understanding of the flavonoid pathway in non-vinifera grape varieties. </p...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MAgricAdmin (Agricultural Economics)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The wine {{industry}} {{is one of}} the oldest commercial activities in South Africa. The South African <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> industry annually produces more than a million tonnes of grapes, making the country the ninth largest producer in the world. The total area under <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> production is divided into eight regions for administrative purposes. These boundaries are a legacy of the era of controlled marketing and there is continued meaningfulness of having various classifications such as ‘wine of origin’ scheme. The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that determine the producers’ choice of <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivars in the wine regions in South Africa. Time series data for the period 1990 - 2003 were used to estimate the parameters of linear regression models. Two equations for each <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivar in each region were postulated and estimated using Ordinary Least Squares as applied with Eviews. Further, a stepwise regression as applied in STATISTICA was used to eliminate the parameters that were not statistically significant at five percent significant level. In identifying the factors that determine the choice of <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivars in the regions, the results showed that each <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivar in each region has its own factors influencing the producers’ choice of that specific <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivar. Same <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivars in different regions similarly have its own factors determining the producers’ choice. The implication of this is that there are differences in terms of the requirements and types of crops and <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivars grown in each region. However, the most important result that emerged with regular frequency is that, the factors determining the producers’ choice of a specific <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivar for each region is price of other <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivars and competitive products in that wine region. The price of specific <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivars only had an influence on few <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivars. The implication is that the producers in South Africa appears to consider the prices of other <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivars and competitive products before making a choice of whether to plant or uproot a specific <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivar more than the price of the specific <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivar. This supports the theory that farm prices play a key role in allocating resources and in rewarding efficient producers...|$|R
