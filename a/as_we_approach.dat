500|$|Fortunately at {{the present}} time we are in an area where the water is deeper than normal for the Atlantic and for a number of hours there is [...] worry about {{unexpectedly}} scraping the top of any unsuspected submerged peak. [...] But we will want that fathometer badly <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> Cape Horn.|$|E
500|$|The third {{ball was}} revamped again in 1995 for 1996, adding a {{computerized}} lighting system with 180 halogen bulbs and 144 strobe lights, and over 12,000 rhinestones. Lighting designer Barry Arnold {{stated that the}} changes were [...] "something [...] {{had to be done}} to make this event more spectacular <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> the millennium." ...|$|E
500|$|A promotional {{video for}} the tour was {{released}} in September 2009. West posted the video on his blog accompanied by the text, [...] "What happened to all the rock stars? The fame killed them!" [...] The 30-second clip features slow-motion footage of a topless Gaga being carried by a man presumed to be West. Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone described it as [...] "soft 70s porn", while adding that he had [...] "no idea what [...] {{has to do with}} the 30-second clip, but we're sure it'll start to make more sense as more promos roll out <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> the tour's launch." ...|$|E
60|$|Despite the slowing of the engines, and {{the dead}} silence that prevailed, the boats were {{observed}} by the Turkish sentinels <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached.</b>|$|R
60|$|A dark mass loomed {{in front}} of us, which proved <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> to be four horses {{fastened}} by their bridles to the hedge.|$|R
60|$|As I supposed, the {{carriage}} contained ladies, and I knew them all. The coachman instinctively drew up, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached.</b> <b>We</b> always stopped and spoke, on such occasions.|$|R
2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} {{positive}} review: [...] "It's deals and betrayal on Once Upon a Time <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> the final two weeks of Season 5. So it's fitting, naturally, that we pick up with Emma (and everyone else) asking WHAT?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Another top legal {{firm in the}} US, Speiser Krause, which {{represented}} 60 relatives, of whom half were UK families, concluded contingency deals securing them fees of between 28 and 35% of individual settlements. Frank Granito of Speiser Krause noted that [...] "the rewards in the US are more substantial {{than anywhere else in}} the world but nobody has questioned the fee whilst the work has been going on, it is only now <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> a resolution when the criticism comes your way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paradoxically, {{dimensional}} analysis {{can be a}} useful tool even if all the parameters in the underlying theory are dimensionless, e.g., lattice models such as the Ising model {{can be used to}} study phase transitions and critical phenomena. Such models can be formulated in a purely dimensionless way. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> the critical point closer and closer, the distance over which the variables in the lattice model are correlated (the so-called correlation length, [...] ) becomes larger and larger. Now, the correlation length is the relevant length scale related to critical phenomena, so one can, e.g., surmise on [...] "dimensional grounds" [...] that the non-analytical part of the free energy per lattice site should be [...] where [...] is the dimension of the lattice.|$|E
60|$|The {{sound of}} Chainbearer's voice, {{speaking}} in a low but distinct tone, caught our ears <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> him, and <b>we</b> all stopped to listen.|$|R
6000|$|Cain. [...] But {{the lights}} fade from me fast, [...] And some till now grew larger <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached,</b> [...] And wore {{the look of}} worlds.|$|R
6000|$|... "Be not downhearted, dearest Dus," [...] I whispered, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> the storehouse; [...] "after all, these wretches {{will not}} dare to transgress against the law, very far." ...|$|R
2500|$|Cumbric {{place names}} {{are found in}} Scotland south of the firths of Forth and Clyde. Brittonic names north of this line are Pictish. They are also found {{commonly}} in the historic county of Cumberland and bordering areas of Northumberland. They are less common in Westmorland, with some in Lancashire and the adjoining areas of North Yorkshire. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> Cheshire, late Brittonic placenames are probably better described as being Welsh rather than Cumbric. As noted below, however, any clear distinction between Cumbric and Welsh is difficult to prove. For references see Armstrong et al., Watson and Jackson. [...] There remain many Brittonic place-names in northern England which should not be described as Cumbric because they originate from a period before Brittonic split into its daughter dialects e.g. Welsh, Cornish, Breton and– arguably– Cumbric.|$|E
6000|$|... "You surely {{understand}} {{the reason why}} it grows warmer <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> the equator, and colder as we go from it, whether we go north or south?" ...|$|E
60|$|More {{and more}} {{beautiful}} grows the scene <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> the Rhone--the river broader, hills more commanding, and architecture tinged with the Italian. Bradshaw says it equals the Rhine.|$|E
6000|$|Father couldn't even shake hands, for Dolly {{was still}} pawing and {{plunging}} but he smiled <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> {{and called out}} in reference to Dolly, [...] "She'll quiet down in a minute." ...|$|R
60|$|One {{of these}} searchers for useless {{treasure}} straightened up <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached,</b> and I {{saw that he}} was an old man, who looked as if he might have been a gentleman's servant.|$|R
60|$|We {{said no more}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> the light, {{but made}} softly for the door. I laid my hand upon the latch; and {{whispering}} Steerforth to keep close to me, went in.|$|R
60|$|If you {{see your}} way to meet us in New Orleans, drop me a line, now, and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> that city I will {{telegraph}} you what day we shall arrive there.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, sir," [...] he said, [...] "we {{may fall}} in with peasants, or be {{challenged}} by sentries, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> the battery, and {{my ability to}} speak Spanish might be an advantage." ...|$|E
6000|$|What opium is instilled {{into all}} disaster! It shows {{formidable}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> it, {{but there is}} at last no rough rasping friction, but the most slippery sliding surfaces. We fall soft on a thought; Ate Dea is gentle,-- ...|$|E
60|$|To {{my great}} joy I saw, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached,</b> {{that the girl}} who stooped to kindle the fire was Waboose. Her mother sat on a bank near her, looking very pale and worn.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Rochester {{must have}} been aware of the {{entrance}} of Mrs. Fairfax and myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never lifted his head <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Reverend Finch was {{suffering}} under a second suspension of speech. All {{he could say}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> {{the door of the}} silent and solitary building--and he said that with extreme difficulty--was, [...] "Pray let us be careful!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We cannot fight them, today, {{but we can}} hinder their work. We will scatter {{through the}} forest and, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> them, each is to sound his horn; and {{continue}} to do so, from time to time. The Romans will think that a great force is advancing against them." ...|$|E
60|$|But <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> {{the present}} age we still find {{wonderful}} narrations about archers. Robin Hood, for instance, {{was a great}} fellow with the bow. It is said that on one occasion he shot an arrow so that it fell a mile {{from where he was}} standing! A long shot, and hard to be equalled by the crack rifles of the present day.|$|E
60|$|Towards mid-day, {{on looking}} out, we see two tiny spires {{standing}} {{side by side}} against the sky. They seem to be twins, and grow taller <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach.</b> I describe them to B., and he says they are the steeples of Cologne Cathedral; and we all begin to yawn and stretch, and to collect our bags and coats and umbrellas.|$|E
60|$|A {{very few}} minutes sufficed {{to reach the}} limits of our narrow domain; and, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> them, Guert {{pointed out to me}} the mound of ice that was piling up behind it, as a most fearful symptom.|$|R
60|$|I {{observed}} {{with a feeling}} of surprise, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> him, that none of these garments showed the slightest indication of the rough treatment and wetting which they must have received during their wearer's submersion and struggle to the shore.|$|R
60|$|The black, {{wrinkled}} face {{could be}} seen through the window <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached,</b> and so far as being able to read an expression of either hope or despair upon his countenance, one {{might as well have}} gazed at a graven image.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon--Lord Aylward. I {{was aware of}} the {{contemplated}} purchase of that title, I did not know that it had been completed. I was about to add that all the same we mean to go to that camp, and that if any violence towards us is attempted <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> it, you will remember that you are in our hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|Suppose {{the various}} kinds of land to be {{represented}} by the [...] alphabet; that those below O pay no agricultural rent, and that [...] all lands increase in fertility and situation <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach</b> the [...] beginning of the alphabet, but which, as far up as K, are used in [...] agriculture; that higher than K all are more profitably used for [...] building purposes, viz.: ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{had gone}} on quite ahead of my company, and as my mule soberly paced {{downward}} in the almost perpendicular road, I seemed to be poised so high above the enchanting scene that I had somewhat the same sensation as if I were flying. I don't wonder that larks seem to get into such a rapture when they are {{high up in the}} air. What a dreamlike beauty there is in distance, disappearing ever <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approach!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldn't lay {{too much}} stress {{on what you}} have been telling me," [...] I {{observed}} quietly <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> that unattractive building. [...] "No man will believe a girl who has just accepted his suit to be not well-balanced,--you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What, in natur', {{does all}} this mean?" [...] exclaimed old Holmes, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> him, reining in his horse, for the {{purposes}} of a conference. [...] "Is the governor sending out ra-al Injins ag'in' us, in order to favor the landlords?" ...|$|R
50|$|Continued {{growth in}} demand for student places at the College has meant that an {{additional}} English teaching block containing six classrooms, new Special Needs Accommodation, an additional Laboratory and a new Art and Design room were opened <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> the millennium.|$|R
