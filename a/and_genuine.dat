5|$|Howard {{shows up}} at Bernadette's {{apartment}} and gives Penny a heartfelt <b>and</b> <b>genuine</b> apology to give to her, which reduces Penny to tears. Bernadette overhears this and forgives him. Amy is relieved that she is still a maid of honor and the four hug. Leonard later meets Penny {{in the laundry room}} and wants to have sex, but Penny declines.|$|E
5|$|In {{the romantic}} period, typified by Sylves (1927) and Volumes (1928), Rabearivelo's poems are shorter and reflect a purer form of {{traditional}} models. He identified {{himself and his}} work as post-symbolist {{in the early part}} of his artistic career. Regarding Rabearivelo's works from this period, editor Jacques Rabemananjara acknowledged the poet's evident talent but critiqued his over-adherence to form and poetic conventions at the expense of innovation <b>and</b> <b>genuine</b> self-expression.|$|E
5|$|Pliny {{returns to}} the problem of fraud and the {{detection}} of false gems using several tests, including the scratch test, where counterfeit gems can be marked by a steel file, <b>and</b> <b>genuine</b> ones not. Perhaps it refers to glass imitations of jewellery gemstones. He refers to using one hard mineral to scratch another, presaging the Mohs hardness scale. Diamond sits {{at the top of the}} series because, Pliny says, it will scratch all other minerals.|$|E

5|$|Since its {{original}} release, Cannibal Holocaust {{has been the}} target of censorship by moral and animal activists. Other than graphic gore, the film contains several scenes of sexual violence <b>and</b> <b>genuine</b> cruelty to animals, issues which find Cannibal Holocaust in the midst of controversy to this day. Due to this notoriety, Cannibal Holocaust has been marketed as having been banned in over 50 countries. In 2006, Entertainment Weekly magazine named Cannibal Holocaust as the 20th most controversial film of all time.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his life}} in {{politics}} and his long military career he characterised the arrogant and extravagant aristocrat of the period. His progression through the Army was marked by many episodes of extraordinary incompetence, but this can be measured against his generosity to the men under his command <b>and</b> <b>genuine</b> bravery. As {{a member of the}} landed aristocracy he had actively and steadfastly opposed any political reform in Britain, but {{in the last year of}} his life he relented and came to acknowledge that such reform would bring benefit to all classes of society.|$|E
5|$|Although Littleprincessemma, American Pharoah's dam, is the {{half-sister}} to graded stakes winner Storm Wolf, and to Misty Rosette, {{winner of}} the Old Hat Stakes in 2006, her own undistinguished racing career, combined with the modest record of her sire, Yankee Gentleman, dampened initial public expectations for her second-born foal. Yet American Pharoah's maternal bloodline includes Storm Cat, a Grade I winner retired early due to injury, Northern Dancer, a Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner, and Terlingua, a celebrated broodmare, through whom he is a fifth-generation descendant of Secretariat. He is also descended through his dam from Flying Paster, a Grade I champion who was 1978 California Horse of the Year, and Exclusive Native (sire of Affirmed <b>and</b> <b>Genuine</b> Risk). Through both sire and dam, American Pharoah is a fifth- and sixth-generation descendant of Bold Ruler, {{as well as a}} sixth- and seventh-generation descendant of Tom Fool, one of the top thoroughbreds of the last century. His tail-female line traces back to The Oldfield Mare, foaled circa 1695.|$|E

5|$|The new {{pieces were}} {{publicly}} announced on May 15, 1965, and coin dealers immediately offered $7.50 each for them, ensuring {{that they would}} not circulate. The public announcement prompted a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources during a severe coin shortage, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 dollars had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure {{that there would be no}} repetition, Congress inserted a provision in the Coinage Act of 1965 forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years. No 1964-D Peace dollars are known to exist in either public or private hands. Two specimens were discovered in a Treasury vault in 1970 and were destroyed, but rumors and speculation about others in illegal private possession continue to appear from time to time. The issue has also been privately restruck using unofficial dies <b>and</b> <b>genuine,</b> earlier-date Peace dollars resulting in an altered date.|$|E

25|$|Despite her conniving and vindictive nature, {{she often}} {{displays}} tender <b>and</b> <b>genuine</b> compassion toward family and loved one. For {{the duration of}} the serial, Dorian suffers from claustrophobia, which is explained {{to be the result of}} her mother Sonya's child abuse (actress Strasser states stated that this character trait was added to mirror her actual illness).|$|E
25|$|Her {{religion}} prevented {{her from}} being crowned, as Roman Catholics {{were forbidden to}} take part in Anglican services. She initially faced hardships due to the language barrier, the king's infidelities and the political conflicts between Roman Catholics and Anglicans. Over time, her quiet decorum, loyalty <b>and</b> <b>genuine</b> affection for Charles changed the public's perception of her.|$|E

25|$|The {{album was}} also {{released}} as a shaped wooden box set (aka Siamese Dream Collectors Edition) with metal hinges, limited to only 1,000 copies and containing the UK HUT CD album {{housed in a}} recess with individually numbered silver metal embossed plate at the side and a 20-page booklet housed in a similar recess in the lid. Though the CD itself and the booklet are official <b>and</b> <b>genuine,</b> the wooden box is not an official Virgin (US) or HUT (UK) release.|$|E
25|$|Speculation {{in stocks}} {{is a risky}} and complex {{occupation}} because {{the direction of the}} markets are generally unpredictable and lack transparency, also financial regulators are sometimes unable to adequately detect, prevent and remediate irregularities committed by malicious listed companies or other financial market participants. In addition, the financial markets are usually subjected to speculation. This does not invalidate the well documented true <b>and</b> <b>genuine</b> stories of large success and consistent profitability of many individual stock investors and stock investing organizations along the history.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, Scranton {{was chosen}} by President Ford to become United States Ambassador to the United Nations. His {{measured}} approach to diplomacy <b>and</b> <b>genuine</b> interest in human rights earned him much respect in his short time in office. Some in the Republican Party pushed for Scranton to be named Ford’s running mate for the 1976 presidential election, but Ford chose Senator Robert Dole of Kansas instead. After his term as UN Ambassador, Scranton retired {{to his home in}} Dalton, Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|The Dalai Lama {{denied that}} his {{government}} {{had anything to}} do with the Olympic protests and said that he did not advocate a boycott of the games. He called on demonstrators to refrain from any violence, and gave interviews clarifying that his goals were not currently to seek independence from China. The Dalai Lama threatened to resign over TPUM disobedience to the official policy of non-violence <b>and</b> <b>genuine</b> Tibetan autonomy. In the end, international pressure finally led PRC representatives to renew unofficial talks with their Dharmsala counterparts.|$|E
25|$|In his Stigmata: A Medieval Phenomenon in a Modern Age, Ted Harrison {{suggests}} that there is no single mechanism whereby the marks of stigmata were produced. Harrison found no evidence from a study of contemporary cases that the marks were supernatural in origin. He concluded, however, that marks of natural origin need not be hoaxes. Some stigmatics marked themselves in attempt to suffer with Christ as a form of piety. Others marked themselves accidentally and their marks were noted as stigmata by witnesses. Often marks of human origin produced profound <b>and</b> <b>genuine</b> religious responses.|$|E
