5|$|Herrerasaurus had a long, narrow skull that lacked {{nearly all}} the specializations that {{characterized}} later dinosaurs, and more closely resembled those of more primitive archosaurs such as Euparkeria. It had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) in its skull, two pairs of which were for the eyes and nostrils. Between the eyes and the nostrils were two antorbital fenestrae <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of tiny, 1-centimeter-long (0.4in) slit-like holes called promaxillary fenestrae.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} World War I Kilkis saw {{service in}} the Allied {{intervention}} in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea. While supporting the French and British forces defending Sevastopol in April 1919, Kilkis observed mutinies on several French battleships. Her crew taunted the French mutineers by hanging a dummy from the yardarm. Kilkis then returned to Greece. During the subsequent Greco-Turkish War, Kilkis served in support of landings to seize Ottoman territory. On 15 May 1919, she <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of destroyers escorted a convoy of six transports carrying the troops that undertook the occupation of Smyrna and its environs. Kilkis carried Rear Admiral Kaloulides, who thereafter served as the military governor of the city. The Ottoman Navy had been interned by the Allies {{after the end of}} World War I, and so provided no opposition to the Royal Hellenic Navy's activities.|$|E

5|$|Both {{ships were}} rearmed {{in the late}} 1860s with 14 seven-inch and 2 eight-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns. The new guns were heavier so fewer could be carried. On both ships the eight-inch guns were mounted {{amidships}} on the main deck on the broadside <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of seven-inch guns were mounted on the upper deck as fore and aft chase guns. Eight of the remaining seven-inch guns were also placed on the main deck on the broadside where they were protected by the ship's armour, but one pair was on the main deck further aft where they were not protected by armour. The two ships differed where the last pair of seven-inch guns was positioned: Defence mounted them on the main deck, forward of the armour, while Resistance mounted hers on the upper deck.|$|E
