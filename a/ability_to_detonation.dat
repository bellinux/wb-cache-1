40|$|The {{validity}} {{and accuracy of}} performance measurements for pulse detonation engines depend on the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> accurately measure thrust and fuel mass flow rates during system operation. Experimental tests have revealed that when fuel mass flow rates are calculated by conventional mass metering methods, incorrect values of the aggregate fuel mass in the combustor will often be calculated due to inaccurate assumptions regarding the spatial fuel distribution. The difficulty in predicting the actual fuel distribution affects the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> achieve reliable <b>detonations</b> for successful operation and introduces inaccuracies directly into the performance calculations. Tunable diode laser and absorption spectroscopy techniques have been applied to provide time-resolved fuel mass fraction measurements and improve the fidelity of the specific impulse calculations. Results show that stratified fuel distributions that begin near stoichiometric at the forward end of the combustor and gradually become fuel lean near the combustor exit produce substantially higher specific impulse values than axially uniform fuel distributions with {{the same amount of}} aggregate fuel due <b>to</b> the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> reliably detonate while operating at an overall lean condition.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. Operational {{characteristics of a}} valveless pulse detonation engine system are being characterized by both experimental and computational efforts. The detonation diffraction process from a small "initiator" combustor to a larger diameter main combustor in a continuous airflow configuration was evaluated during multi-cycle operation of a pulse detonation engine. The multi-cycle detonation experiments were performed on an axisymetric engine geometry operating on both ethylene and propane fuel/air mixtures. The new design explored the effect of forward relief area on performance and its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> isolate the <b>detonation</b> products from the incoming air flow during cyclic operation. The use of a small fuel-oxygen initiator to initiate a fuel/air detonation in a larger main combustor has been achieved and has demonstrated the benefit of generating an overdriven detonation condition near the diffraction plane for enhanced transmission to a larger combustor. Mach reflections have been observed on the outer wall downstream of the diffraction plane for the two-dimensional geometry and {{appear to be the}} primary re-initiation mechanisms for the re-established fuel-air detonations for this geometry. Multi-cycle tests have successfully evaluated initiator/main combustor diameter ratios of up to 1. 58 and are expected to continue through 2. 0. FUNDED BY: N 00014 - 02 - 2 - 0153.

The results are often represented as run distance or time versus input shock 4 pressure on Pop plots. In practice, however, input shocks to explosives are often not 1 D. Instead, they may 5 be oblique or non-planar. Here, we present results {{from a series of}} experiments in which a PBX 9502 slab 6 was bonded on one side to a PBX 9501 slab. The faster detonation in the PBX 9501 slab drove an oblique 7 shock in the PBX 9502. The result was a two-dimensional (2 D) shock structure consisting of a region of 8 delayed reaction, referred to as an initiating layer, immediately adjacent to the PBX 9501 / 9502 interface, 9 and a transition <b>to</b> <b>detonation</b> further from the interface. The initiating layer thickness varied with the input 10 shock pressure, which was controlled by the thickness of the PBX 9501 layer. The results of seven such 11 tests are presented in run-time vs. input-shock-pressure space and compared to Pop plots generated with 12 data from 1 D experiments.
