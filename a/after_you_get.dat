6000|$|... "I {{have just}} {{heard that the}} {{solicitor}} is to be seen to-morrow. Possibly, therefore, I shall return in the evening <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What are {{you going}} to do with yourselves <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> settled?" [...] asked Jo, {{buttoning}} Amy's cloak as she used to button her pinafores.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Fleur, [...] "six weeks. You'll have {{forgotten}} me by then. We'll {{meet in the}} National Gallery the day <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{glad you}} didn't back out, at any rate. You did show pluck, you poor things! I hope you enjoyed the beach <b>after</b> <b>you</b> did <b>get</b> there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I just {{stuck on}} {{and did what}} I could with the stuff. I got a bit of money of my own--and I said to myself, 'Well, here you are with the gear and no one to look <b>after</b> <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> won't <b>get</b> such a chance again, my boy, not in all your born days. Why not make what you can with it? '" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose a mad dog or {{a runaway}} horse was <b>after</b> <b>you,</b> could <b>you</b> <b>get</b> {{out of the}} way without upsetting, Colonel," [...] asked the Doctor, with a twinkle in the eyes that were fixed on the rakish hat.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> {{into the}} valley," [...] said Rollo, [...] "shall you go across it, {{and go over}} the {{mountains}} on the other side, into Italy?" ...|$|E
60|$|From Clifton to Culham {{the river}} banks are flat, monotonous, and uninteresting, but, <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> through Culhalm Lock—the coldest and deepest {{lock on the}} river—the {{landscape}} improves.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can foot your expenses, and lend you a year's {{income in}} advance. But {{it must be}} a clean cut; <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> out there your {{whereabouts}} must only be known to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some day," [...] said Mr. Truax, [...] "when you're {{head of a}} women's {{real-estate}} firm, <b>after</b> <b>you</b> women <b>get</b> the vote, and rusty, old-fashioned {{people like}} me {{are out of the}} way, perhaps you can do that sort of thing." [...] And he smiled encouragingly.|$|R
60|$|Jeff {{run off to}} get the water, though, {{just like}} he hadn't been saying {{anything}} spiteful, for he's a raal good-hearted fellow, <b>after</b> all, once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> at the foundation of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "And, Tom," [...] said Mrs. Shearne, [...] "you {{are sure}} to be {{comfortable}} at school, because I asked Mrs. Davy to write to her sister, Mrs. Spencer, who has a son at Eckleton, and tell her {{to tell him to}} look <b>after</b> <b>you</b> when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> there. He is in Mr. Dencroft's house, which is next door to Mr. Blackburn's, so you will be quite close to one another. Mind you write directly <b>you</b> <b>get</b> there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the least. My veglione hasn't ended yet. I'm still {{practically}} at the Pergola. It's easy {{to keep a}} {{thing of}} that sort up if you don't sleep <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{you know}} what your rights are, an don't you let Job impose on you in any way. I'll be round here <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> through work, an' we'll bunk in somewhere together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{we thought}} we'd give the fellows a little surprise," [...] {{answered}} Dick modestly. [...] "We purchased the biplane some time ago. It's easy to run <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the knack of it." ...|$|E
50|$|Treatments {{that seriously}} affect {{the immune system}} e.g. bone marrow {{transplant}} and cancer treatment—in these your entire bone marrow—is {{the source of the}} immune system—is wiped out, to clear the body of cancer (which can often spread to the marrow). <b>After</b> that <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a transplant in of cancer-free marrow, from a donor, or from yourself when you were in remission. These basically have to re-generate the immune repertoire again.|$|R
50|$|Once {{an ability}} surpasses 20, it gains {{a level of}} mastery, noted by a rune (ш) and then drops down to 1. So instead of 21, the {{character}} would have a 1ш. This cycle repeats, so <b>after</b> 20ш <b>you</b> <b>get</b> 1ш2, signifying two masteries. The first edition book lists some godlike powers up to 12 masteries (ш12), as this system allows for limitless scaling without a huge burden of additional dice or complex math.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, lass, that's {{no way for}} a woman," [...] said Wade, {{and there}} was {{something}} in his kind tone, in his look, in his presence, that calmed Columbine. [...] "I'll look <b>after</b> Moore. <b>You</b> go <b>get</b> some water an' a towel." ...|$|R
60|$|They keep {{always trying}} to make your bed before you get up, thus {{destroying}} your rest and inflicting agony upon you; but <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> up, they don't come any more till next day.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will feel}} very {{differently}} <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> over being tired and bewildered," [...] said Anne, who, knowing a certain thing that Leslie did not know, {{did not feel}} herself called upon to waste overmuch sympathy.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I don’t suppose you’ll {{mind the}} {{seasickness}} <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> used to it," [...] said the considerate Mr. Chalk, [...] "and the storms, and the cyclones, and fogs, and collisions, {{and all that}} sort of thing." ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{my great}} {{ambition}} now {{to catch a}} broadbill. That would completely round out my fishing experience. And I shall try. But I doubt that I will be so fortunate. It takes a long time. Boschen was years catching his fish. Moreover, though {{it is hard to}} get a broadbill to bite--and harder to hook him--it is infinitely harder to do anything with him <b>after</b> <b>you</b> do <b>get</b> fast to him.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Manley smiled. [...] "You young scamps, {{you have}} got 'runaway from home' as plainly on your faces {{as if it was}} printed there. If we were to enlist you, we should be having your friends here <b>after</b> <b>you</b> to-morrow, and <b>get</b> into a scrape for taking you." ...|$|R
50|$|In January 2010 The Subs {{launched}} a new concept on YouTube, which they called The Famous Videocast. During three short shows, hosted by The Subs themselves, the band members talk about the music videos they like. Each time they mention a video, you can click through to the video. <b>After</b> each video, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> directed back to the show.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed I do, and <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a {{taste of}} the old fellow's flesh, roasted in his own shell, you'll say it goes ahead of {{everything}} except a morsel of fat from the back of Mr. Armadillo." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There will {{be plenty}} of time for {{explanation}} <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> here," [...] was the mysterious reply, and then the deacon signified that the interview was at an end by turning to speak with some gentlemen who had been watching the boys closely.|$|E
6000|$|Trot's face fell. [...] "I'll {{hold on to}} the handle," [...] said Button-Bright, [...] "and she {{can hold}} on to me. It doesn't pull hard at all. You've no idea {{how easy it is to}} fly that way <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> used to it." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{defending}} the Motherland, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> into a Sherman and land on Utah Beach, {{where you have}} to clear the bunkers and advance to St. Mere Eglise. Then <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to drive around the Bocage and destroy some V-2 rockets. And <b>after</b> that, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> Operation Cobra, where you have destroy some artillery. The next mission {{is probably one of the}} hardest. You go up against nothing but Tigers, and <b>you</b> have to <b>get</b> the tank ace named Michael Wittmann. Following that, you join the 3rd Army and drive like hell up to Bastogne to rescue the 101st Airborne in the Battle of the Bulge. Next <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to go in a King Tiger and sneak behind enemy lines again. And the last mission is the drive to and crossing of the Rhine, {{where you have to}} break through to the river and get over before the bridge is blown up.|$|R
50|$|After the German Campaign {{there is}} the Russian campaign. In the first mission, you have to cross the Volga and {{complete}} the encirclement of Stalingrad. In the next mission, {{you have to stop}} the German's Operation Winter Storm by destroying a heavily armored supply train. And then <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to go into Stalingrad and root out the Germans in the Red Square there. The next Russian mission is to stop the initial push of the German at Kursk in July 1943. <b>After,</b> that <b>you</b> <b>get</b> in a German Panther tank and sneak behind the German lines to rescue some Russian POWs. And then you have to destroy the German's last all-out attempt to win the battle of Kursk.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then kill me now, {{or you may}} slip up on one of your {{cherished}} buzzard-feasts," [...] cried Joe, with glinting eye and taunting voice. [...] "Then go sneaking back to your hole like a hyena, {{and stay}} there. Wetzel is on your trail! He missed you last night; but {{it was because of}} the girl. He's <b>after</b> <b>you,</b> Girty; he'll <b>get</b> <b>you</b> one of these days, and when he does--My God!---" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You ketched {{the kid in}} time. That's all I wanted. Take him an' Leslie {{up in one of}} {{the canyons}} an' keep them there till further orders. You needn't stay, Stockton, <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> them in a safe place. An' you can send up grub." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{should think}} you might be {{interested}} in me: nobody else can do for me what you can, and I want you to stay with me. That's just the way with you men: you don't care any thing about us <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes! {{see it all}} through," [...] said Mr. Van Astrachan. [...] "Young {{people must}} be young. It's all right enough, and you won't miss my Polly <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> fairly into it near so much as I shall. I'll sit up for her till twelve o'clock, and read my paper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that is {{a cabinet}} to put them in, and keep them safe. Then, when you have done looking at them yourself, you put them away safely; and, <b>after</b> a time, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a great many collected, and you take {{pleasure}} in looking them over from time to time, and showing them to other boys that come to see you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] he said, [...] "not {{for another}} moment shall {{you feel as}} poor as that. Money will have no value {{for you in the}} future. The fifty {{thousand}} pounds will only be a start. <b>After</b> that, <b>you</b> will <b>get</b> royalties. If I had it, I would give you {{a quarter of a million}} now for your plans; I know that I can <b>get</b> <b>you</b> more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who all was doin' the talkin' last night?" [...] asked Frank next morning, when we {{were having}} a late breakfast. [...] "Cause I've a joke on somebody. Jim he talks in his sleep often, an' last night <b>after</b> <b>you</b> did finally <b>get</b> settled down, Jim he up in his sleep an' says: 'Shore he's windy as hell! Shore he's windy as hell'!" ...|$|R
