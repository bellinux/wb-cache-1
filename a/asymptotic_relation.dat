40|$|Dipole mixed {{pulsation}} {{modes of}} consecutive radial order {{have been detected}} for thousands of low-mass red-giant stars with the NASA space telescope Kepler. Such modes {{have the potential to}} reveal information on the physics of the deep stellar interior. Different methods have been proposed to derive an observed value for the gravity-mode period spacing, the most prominent one relying on a relation derived from asymptotic pulsation theory applied to the gravity-mode character of the mixed modes. Our aim is to compare results based on this <b>asymptotic</b> <b>relation</b> with those derived from an empirical approach for three pulsating red-giant stars. We developed a data-driven method to perform frequency extraction and mode identification. Next, we used the identified dipole mixed modes to determine the gravity-mode period spacing by means of an empirical method and by means of the <b>asymptotic</b> <b>relation.</b> In our methodology, we consider the phase offset, ϵ_g, of the <b>asymptotic</b> <b>relation</b> as a free parameter.
