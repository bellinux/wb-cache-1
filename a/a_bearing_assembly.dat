50|$|All {{parts of}} a bearing are subject to many design constraints. For example, {{the inner and outer}} races are often complex shapes, making them {{difficult}} to manufacture. Balls and rollers, though simpler in shape, are small; since they bend sharply where they run on the races, the bearings are prone to fatigue. The loads within <b>a</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly</b> are also affected by the speed of operation: rolling-element bearings may spin over 100,000 rpm, and the principal load in such a bearing may be momentum rather than the applied load. Smaller rolling elements are lighter and thus have less momentum, but smaller elements also bend more sharply where they contact the race, causing them to fail more rapidly from fatigue. Maximum rolling-element bearing speeds are often specified in 'nDm', which is the product of the mean diameter (in mm) and the maximum RPM. For angular contact bearings nDms over 2.1 million {{have been found to be}} reliable in high performance rocketry applications.|$|E

The friction torque depends on the viscosity of the grease base oil, on its nature (mineral, ester, PAO, etc.), on the coefficient of friction in full film conditions, but also on the interaction between grease thickener and base oil, which affected contact replenishment and contact starvation, and thus influenced the friction torque...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of idlers is to provide the correct shaping, support and {{protection}} of a belt conveyor, reduce motion resistance as well as support for transported materials. The durability of idlers depends on numerous construction, engineering and operational factors. In practice, the idler bearings are often damaged due to wear and tear, jamming or seizure and the calculated durability does not comply with the actual lifetime of a bearing (Antoniak 2007). According to laboratory and operational practices, the quality of currently manufactured standard idlers is low and their average durability is approximately one year (Gladysiewicz, Orzeł, Noga 2012). Idlers {{do not meet the}} requirements specified in the PN-M- 46606 : 2010 standard, even at the stage of their production, which is confirmed by tests carried out in the Department of Mechanical Devices Testing – the Central Mining Institute (GIG). Taking the above into consideration, testing stands which allow the testing of static and dynamic resistance of idlers' movements as well as stands for examing the idlers' water-tightness and dust-tightness in accordance with the PN-M- 46606 : 2010 standard have been designed and constructed in the Department of Mechanical Devices Testing – the Central Mining Institute. The abovementioned testing stands were extended with additional functions, with regard to the above specified standard, facilitating the measurement of the temperature of bearing assemblies and to test the influence of rotational speed and idler loading in regards to durability. The tests were carried out on idlers with diameters of ϕ 133 and ϕ 159 mm, with <b>a</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly</b> equipped with a single-raw ballbearing. A newly developed type of hybrid seal (labyrinth-lip), registered in the Patent Office of the Republic of Poland under the number W. 121582 on 17 December 2012 (Pytlik, Rabsztyn 2012), was used in the idler with the diameter of ϕ 133. A typical labyrinth seal was used in the idler with the diameter of ϕ 159. On the basis of the durability tests carried out on both of these idlers it can be concluded that the applied research methodology describes the test conditions of idlers, in a manner {{as close as possible to}} their actual operational conditions, which were subject to a variety of factors for a total time of 116 hours, they included: dust, water, loads and variable rotational speed.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{two major}} failure {{phenomena}} that bearing industry face, (i) Brittle materials failure phenomenon {{commonly referred to}} as Hertzian cone crack, which is formed due to impact or indentation, and (ii) the bearing assembly is prone to failure due to fretting wear at the bearing/shaft and the bearing/housing interface. Finite Element Method was utilized to study the nature of Hertzian cone crack formation and the fretting wear was investigated using an experimental setup. ^ Brittle materials such as silicon carbide SiC, Alumina Al 2 O 3, other ceramics and soda lime glass develop Hertzian cone cracks when indented or impacted by a hard sphere. Ceramics are now being used in various applications and the cone cracks formed during the manufacturing or due to other contact interactions, limit the fatigue life of the component. A Hertzian cone crack is thought to be the origin of catastrophic failure. In this thesis, ABAQUS explicit finite element software is utilized to investigate Hertzian cone crack occurring in various materials. This model employs axisymmetry and cohesive-law to initiate and propagate cracks in arbitrary directions along the grain boundaries. Voronoi tessellation process is used to simulate microstructure of these materials of Hertzian cone crack. The kinematic contact algorithm is used for defining the contact between a sphere and the substrate. A sphere made of the desired material is impacted on a semi-infinite domain at a variety of speeds and the effective impact load is calculated for different materials to compare with the experimental results. Generally, three types of cracks are found in brittle materials, i. e. conical cracks, lateral cracks and radial cracks. Conical crack formations and behavior are studied here. The crack initiation and propagation nature compares well with the experimental results where multiple cracks initiate and gets arrested as the contact radius increases and finally a crack is formed at or just outside the contact radius which propagates as a dominant cone crack. In this study, various parameters such as cone crack initiation radius, crack length, coefficient of restitution are investigated for various materials. The crack length results match closely with the experimental results. From the crack length results for different materials and for different velocities, a correlation between the crack length, material properties and the load is established. ^ Fretting wear occurs due to small oscillatory motion between two bodies in contact. Fretting phenomenon is divided into fretting wear and fretting fatigue, where fretting wear is characterized by debris formation which results in damage and fretting fatigue is a failure caused by crack formation. This study aims to understand the fretting wear occurring in the bearing-housing assembly by varying different parameters such as fits 2 ̆ 6 tolerances, surface roughness, hardness and type of housing material for different load conditions. A test rig is developed to observe the effect of different parameters of housing in the assembly. Reduced factorial design in design of experiments (DOE) is followed to obtain conclusive results with optimum number of experiments. This study provides a guideline of the parameters that should be controlled in <b>a</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly</b> in order to prevent fretting wear and failure due to fretting. Wear volume in the bearing and the number of revolutions after which onset of wear track is observed are used as the governing output parameters in statistically deciding the optimum parameters. ...|$|E

Although bearing life has been traditionally defined by the onset of spalling, as specified by international standard ISO 281, this definition does not always reflect the real operational conditions, since bearing wear can also represent a failure criterion when excessive run-out occurs.
