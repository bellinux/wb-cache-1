40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{about the}} influence of Self-Hypnosis on the three important qualities determining the personality trait of an individual namely: Internal Drive (ID), <b>Ego</b> <b>and</b> Super <b>Ego.</b> Self-Hypnosis is a technique that regulates one’s own mind by setting attributes to achieve the basic goals in life having a wider range of variation from one individual to another. There is a constant conflict occurring in an individual’s mind between ID, <b>Ego,</b> <b>and</b> Super <b>Ego</b> throughout his life time till death. The paper work attempts to bring certain facts about the ID, <b>Ego</b> <b>and</b> Super <b>Ego</b> <b>and</b> how to balance between the three through Self-Hypnosis...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Ego</b> <b>and</b> the Id {{develops}} {{a line of}} reasoning as a groundwork for explaining various (or perhaps all) psychological conditions, pathological and non-pathological alike. These conditions result from powerful internal tensions—for example: 1) between the <b>ego</b> <b>and</b> the id, 2) between the <b>ego</b> <b>and</b> the super <b>ego,</b> <b>and</b> 3) between the love-instinct and the death-instinct. The book deals primarily with the <b>ego</b> <b>and</b> the effects these tensions have on it.|$|R

25|$|Psychologists such as William James {{initially}} {{used the}} term motivation to refer to intention, in a sense similar {{to the concept of}} will in European philosophy. With the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian thinking, instinct also came {{to be seen as a}} primary source of motivation. According to drive theory, the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence. Psychoanalysis, like biology, regarded these forces as physical demands made by the organism on the nervous system. However, they believed that these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche. Classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the reality principle, roughly corresponding to id <b>and</b> <b>ego.</b> Later, in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud introduced the concept of the death drive, a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and psychic repetition of traumatic events. Meanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain, reward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking. Clark Hull formalized the latter idea with his drive reduction model.|$|E

Betty Mensch and Alan Freeman support this view, writing, [...] "Drawing on old Christian symbolism (the fish was an ancient sign of Christianity) Dr. Seuss portrays the fish {{as a kind}} of ever-nagging superego, the embodiment of utterly conventionalized morality." [...] Philip Nel notes that other critics have also compared the fish to the superego. Anna Quindlen called the Cat [...] "pure id" [...] and marked the children, as mediators between the Cat and the fish, as the ego. Mensch and Freeman, however, argue that the Cat shows elements of both id <b>and</b> <b>ego.</b>|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} varied {{depictions of the}} {{different}} forms of Kaali. The most common shows her with four arms and hands, showing aspects of creation and destruction. The two right hands are often held out in blessing, one in a mudra saying [...] "fear not" [...] (abhayamudra), the other conferring boons. Her left hands hold a severed head and blood-covered sword. The sword severs the bondage of ignorance <b>and</b> <b>ego,</b> represented by the severed head. One interpretation of Kaali's tongue is that the red tongue symbolizes the rajasic nature being conquered by the white (symbolizing sattvic) nature of the teeth. Her blackness represents that she is nirguna, beyond all qualities of nature, and transcendent.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the success}} in the box office, Jailhouse Rock earned mixed reviews from critics. It was looked upon as scandalous once it was {{released}} because it portrayed Vince Everett as an anti-heroic character, presented a convict as a hero, used the word [...] "hell" [...] as a profanity, and included a scene showing Presley in bed with co-star Tyler. The Parent-Teacher Association described the movie as [...] "a hackneyed, blown-up tale with cheap human values." [...] The New York Times criticized Guy Trosper for writing a screenplay where the secondary characters whom Mickey Shaughnessey and Judy Tyler acted out were [...] "forced {{to hang on to}} the hero's flying mane <b>and</b> <b>ego</b> for the entire picture." [...] Cue magazine called the film [...] " [...] unpleasant, mediocre and tasteless drama." ...|$|E
500|$|Stanley {{praises the}} series saying [...] "It's not clear exactly why this bleak series is so exhilarating and binge-worthy. It {{could be that}} just as victims of tragedy {{find it hard to}} accept that their {{suffering}} is random and purposeless, voters find it intolerable that so many of the petty, shortsighted moves by elected officials have no greater meaning than small-time expediency." [...] She also notes that the series [...] "is more cynical than The Americans on FX and more pessimistic about human nature than The Walking Dead on AMC". However, The Americans [...] "is more complex and inventive" [...] according to Stanley who concurs that season 2 is darker but notes it is more compelling than season 1. [...] Stuever compares the show unfavorably to both Veep for its [...] "bumbling chaos <b>and</b> <b>ego</b> implosions" [...] over House of Cards [...] "prohibitively sinister" [...] execution and The Good Wife for its superior delivery of [...] "nastiness and self-interest in power plays".|$|E

Their arrival on the musical scene {{paved the way}} for several other notable Southern rock acts — among those Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Marshall Tucker Band and Wet Willie — to achieve commercial success, and also [...] "almost single-handedly" [...] made Capricorn Records into [...] "a major independent label." [...] Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, writing for Rolling Stone, wrote that the group [...] "defined the best of every music from the American South in that time. They were the best of all of us." [...] He went on to call the band [...] "a true brotherhood of players — one that went beyond race <b>and</b> <b>ego.</b> It was a thing of beauty." [...] The band's extended popularity through heavy touring in the early 1990s created a new generation of fans, one that viewed the Allmans as pioneers of [...] "latter-day collegiate jam rock." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{suggest that}} Meyer is likely a Republican, while others feel {{she is a}} Democrat. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times notes that Meyer's party {{affiliation}} is unknown because the show focuses on bullying <b>and</b> <b>ego</b> rather than ideology. James Poniewozik of Time explains the ambiguity as follows: Veep is [...] "almost all politics and almost no political issues". Robert Lloyd of Los Angeles Times explains the lack of need for party affiliations, or even political ideology in a similar manner, saying that Veep is [...] "less a show about politics than about politicking." [...] In an interview with The New Yorker Radio Hour, Julia Louis-Dreyfus suggested that Meyer's associated political party is intentionally left unknown to the audience. Louis-Dreyfus later elaborated: [...] " [...] politics are all about her and staying alive ... she will hold any position if it keeps her in office." [...] In the episode Election Night, CNN represents states won by Meyer as blue. In the same episode, she also comments winning the 'blue wall' states of Connecticut and Vermont with [...] "A bowl of hair could win those states".|$|E
