25|$|Poppy {{seeds are}} a common and flavorsome topping for breads and cakes. One gram of poppy seeds {{contains}} up to 33 micrograms of morphine and 14 micrograms of codeine, and the Substance <b>Abuse</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Services</b> Administration in the United States formerly mandated that all drug screening laboratories use a standard cutoff of 300 nanograms per milliliter in urine samples. A single poppy seed roll (0.76grams of seeds) usually did not produce a positive drug test, but a positive result was observed from eating two rolls. A slice of poppy seed cake containing nearly five grams of seeds per slice produced positive results for 24 hours. Such results are viewed as false positive indications of drug use and were {{the basis of a}} legal defense. On November 30, 1998, the standard cutoff was increased to 2000 nanograms (two micrograms) per milliliter. Confirmation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry will distinguish amongst opium and variants including poppy seeds, heroin, and morphine and codeine pharmaceuticals by measuring the morphine:codeine ratio and looking for the presence of noscapine and acetylcodeine, the latter of which is only found in illicitly produced heroin, and heroin metabolites such as 6-monoacetylmorphine.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Recent {{policy has}} focused on documenting and {{reducing}} ethnic disparities in availability and quality of health care. The authors examined differences by ethnic status in unmet need for alcoholism, drug <b>abuse,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> treatment. METHOD: Data were from a follow-up survey of adult respondents to a 1996 - 1997 national survey. Non-Hispanic whites, African Americans, and Hispanics were compared in access to alcoholism <b>and</b> drug <b>abuse</b> treatment <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care (primary or specialty), unmet need for care, satisfaction with care, and use of active treatment for alcoholism, drug <b>abuse,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems in the prior 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 31. 9 % of whites, 28. 1 % of African Americans, and 30. 1 % of Hispanics had some alcoholism, drug <b>abuse,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care, mostly in primary care. Among those with perceived need, compared to whites, African Americans {{were more likely to}} have no access to alcoholism, drug abuse, or <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care (25. 4 % versus 12. 5 %), and Hispanics {{were more likely to have}} less care than needed or delayed care (22. 7 % versus 10. 7 %). Among those with need, whites were more likely than Hispanics or African Americans to be receiving active alcoholism, drug abuse, or <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> treatment (37. 6 % versus 22. 4 %- 25. 0 %). CONCLUSIONS: The authors document greater unmet need for alcoholism <b>and</b> drug <b>abuse</b> treatment <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care among African American and Hispanics relative to whites. New policies are needed to improve access to and quality of alcoholism, drug <b>abuse,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> treatment across diverse populations...|$|R
