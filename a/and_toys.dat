2500|$|The poodle {{has been}} bred {{in at least}} three sizes, {{including}} Standard, Miniature, <b>and</b> <b>Toy.</b> According to the American Kennel Club, which recognised the breed in 1887, the Standard Poodle is the oldest of the three varieties, and was later bred down to the miniature <b>and</b> <b>toy</b> sizes. The British Kennel Club also recognises three sizes, stating that the miniature <b>and</b> <b>toy</b> are scaled down versions of the standard. The Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) recognizes four sizes of one breed: standard, medium, miniature, <b>and</b> <b>toy.</b> Poodles exist in many coat colors. Despite the Standard Poodle's claim to greater age than the other varieties, some evidence shows the smaller types developed only a short time after the breed assumed the general type by which it is recognized today.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{discrete}} time one-factor {{models of}} the term structure of interest rates and their application to the pricing of interest rate contingent claims are examined theoretically and empirically. The first chapter provides {{a discussion of the}} issues involved in the pricing of interest rate contingent claims and a description of the Ho and Lee (1986), Maloney and Byrne (1989), and Black, Derman, <b>and</b> <b>Toy</b> (1990) discrete time models. In the second chapter, a general discrete time model of the term structure from which the Ho and Lee, Maloney and Byrne, and Black, Derman, <b>and</b> <b>Toy</b> models can all be obtained is presented. The general model also provides for the specification of an additional model, the ExtendedMB model. The third chapter illustrates the application of the discrete time models to the pricing of a variety of interest rate contingent claims. In the final chapter, the performance of the Ho and Lee, Black, Derman, <b>and</b> <b>Toy,</b> <b>and</b> ExtendedMB models in the pricing of Eurodollar futures options is investigated empirically. The results indicate that the Black, Derman, <b>and</b> <b>Toy</b> <b>and</b> ExtendedMB models outperform the Ho and Lee model. Little difference in the performance of the Black, Derman, <b>and</b> <b>Toy</b> <b>and</b> ExtendedMB models is detected. ...|$|R

5|$|A toyline for {{the film}} was {{confirmed}} by Hasbro in February 2012. Despite the movie's release being moved from June 2012 to March 2013, the initial assortments of figures, vehicles, and role-play items were shipped to retailers, and appeared on store shelves in May 2012. A Variety article was published stating that the already released figures had been pulled from the shelves and recalled by Hasbro, although the company's official statement indicated that existing product would be sold through. New product shipments were halted by Hasbro, but existing Retaliation figures were available in Target, Wal-Mart, <b>and</b> <b>Toys</b> R Us as late as December 2012. The toyline was re-released in the United States in February 2013. A four-part limited series comic book titled G.I.

5|$|By this time, {{the first}} wave of what would {{eventually}} be more than four million letters, telegrams, postcards, and phone calls had flooded into RNC headquarters and other political offices. While a later study found that only about 7 percent of these communications addressed any substantive issue, they still ran 75 to one in favor of Nixon. Nixon skeptics joined in; both Stassen and Dewey sent congratulatory telegrams. Many letters included contributions {{to help pay for the}} cost of the broadcast; the RNC eventually recouped four-fifths of the $75,000 cost. Newspaper switchboards were jammed with calls from people seeking the RNC's address, while Western Union was caught off guard by Nixon's request that listeners wire the RNC, and had no extra help on hand.

5|$|Musker and Clements {{created the}} Genie with Robin Williams in mind; even though Katzenberg {{suggested}} actors such as John Candy, Steve Martin, and Eddie Murphy, Williams was approached and eventually accepted the role. Williams came for voice recording sessions during {{breaks in the}} shooting of two other films he was starring in at the time, Hook <b>and</b> <b>Toys.</b> Unusually for an animated film, much of Williams' dialogue was ad-libbed: for some scenes, Williams was given topics and dialogue suggestions, but allowed to improvise his lines. It was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters. Eric Goldberg, the supervising animator for the Genie, then reviewed Williams' recorded dialogue and selected the best gags and lines that his crew would create character animation to match.|$|E

Her husband resigned from his employment in 1989 to work with Judy. Winmark purchased the company in 1992.

In 2010, the complete cost to start a Once Upon a Child was between $200,000 and $250,000 and the average yearly sales were between $650,000 and $725,000.|$|E
