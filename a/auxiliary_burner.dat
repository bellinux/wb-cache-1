40|$|A {{novel model}} of the molten {{carbonate}} fuel cell (MCFC) and gas turbine (GT) hybrid system with direct internal reforming is established, where the fuel cell and the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>burner</b> are taken as the heat reservoirs of the GT. Expressions for the power output and efficiency of the hybrid system are derived by considering various irreversible losses resulting from the overpotentials in the MCFC, the heat leakage in the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>burner,</b> and the finite-rate heat transfer and compression, expansion, and regeneration processes in the GT. The effects of some key parameters including the molar fraction of the oxygen in the oxidant, the utilization factor of the hydrogen in the MCFC {{on the performance of}} the hybrid system are revealed. It is found that the efficiency of the hybrid system will be increased by adding the utilization factor of the hydrogen, and the maximum power output of the hybrid system will be achieved when the utilization factor of the hydrogen is equal to 0. 78. Moreover, the flowing rates of the syngas and oxidant and the molar fraction of the oxygen in the oxidant are determined under the optimal efficiency or maximum power output of the hybrid system.

These small systems including a gas reformer, a fuel cell stack and an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>burner</b> are dimensioned to fulfill the heating and warm water demands of a building by hundred percent in the winter case. Considering the electric efficiency, the thermal load, the dimensions of the storage and the user behavior nearly the same can be said for the accumulated electric load of a building.

"Virtual power plants" as a result of these distributed power stations are seen as an important part in the future grid structure.

In this process, auxiliary fuel such as natural gas or oil is injected directly into the lower region of the primary flame zone just above the grate. This increases and stabilizes the average combustion temperature, which improves combustion of high-moisture fuels, provides more uniform temperature profiles and reduced peak temperature, and reduces the availability of oxygen to reduce NOx formation. This is in contrast to conventional reburning, where natural gas is injected above the primary combustion zone after the majority of NOx has already been formed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStirling {{engines are}} a {{promising}} candidate for micro-cogeneration in residential and small-scale tertiary applications. Due to {{the variability of}} energy demand profiles and electricity tariffs, real applications often require to operate the cogeneration unit with multiple daily starts and stops, especially during summer and intermediate seasons. This work focuses on the experimental analysis of a commercial 1  kWel Stirling unit, burning natural gas and generating 8  kWth of useful heat through hot water and up to 12  kWth with an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>burner,</b> when subjected to cyclic on-off operation. The scope is collecting useful data about energy balances and emissions during on-off transients, which can be later used to optimize {{the management of the}} cogeneration unit when coupled with real users. Different cyclic tests are experimented (with intermediate stops and operation of either one or two burners), keeping the temperature of the cogeneration water at the unit inlet at 50 °C and its mass flow rate at the nominal value of 0. 194  kg/s. The Stirling unit has shown an electrical efficiency of 8. 9 %, based on Lower Heating Value (LHV), in the most favorable cyclic test and 8. 2 % in the worst case, while thermal efficiency ranges between 91. 0 and 92. 6 %. For comparison, the steady state electrical efficiency is 10. 8 % (LHV) while the thermal is 90. 1 % with only one burner running in full cogeneration mode. Steady state efficiencies become 7. 2 % and 92. 0 % (LHV), respectively, with the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>burner</b> running. The significant reduction of average electrical efficiency suggests the necessity to limit the frequency of starts and stops in real operation.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this program was to test the {{technical}} and economic feasibility of a novel dry sorbent injection process called the Two-Step Rapid Sulfur Capture process for several advanced coal utilization systems. The Two-Step Rapid Sulfur Capture process consists of limestone activation in a high temperature <b>auxiliary</b> <b>burner</b> for short times followed by sorbent quenching in a lower temperature sulfur containing coal combustion gas. The Two-Step Rapid Sulfur Capture process {{is based on the}} Non-Equilibrium Sulfur Capture process developed by the Energy Technology Office of Textron Defense Systems (ETO/TDS). Based on the Non-Equilibrium Sulfur Capture studies the range of conditions for optimum sorbent activation were thought to be: activation temperature > 2, 200 K for activation times in the range of 10 [...] 30 ms. Therefore, the aim of the Two-Step process is to create a very active sorbent (under conditions similar to the bomb reactor) and complete the sulfur reaction under thermodynamically favorable conditions.

40|$|This paper {{described}} the findings and data {{resulting from the}} German National Dioxin Measurement Programme at 11 plants with 15 incineration units. The programme’s main focus was to provide answers {{to the question of}} the causes of dioxins and furans formation in the plant and to look for ways to reduce dioxin and furan emissions, including waste management measures and technical measures taken inside the plants. The investigations confirmed the finding that a major proportion of the dioxin and furan emissions is due to de novo synthesis. Two areas have to be mentioned here, the cooling zone behind the combustion chamber and the dust removal system. Significant differences in dioxin and furan concentration levels were ascertained between variations of operating parameters, e. g. much air, little air, extremely unfavourable operating conditions (i. e. start-up and shut-down without <b>auxiliary</b> <b>burners)</b> and the normal operating conditions specific to a plant. To comply the limit value of 0. 1 ng I-TE m- 3 it is necessary that conventional thermal treatment plants take additional measures to remove dioxins and furans from the flue gas.

40|$|A {{considerable}} {{rise in the}} Electric Arc Furnace steelmaking {{has taken}} place in the EU during the last decade. As a result, the amount of steelmaking dust has increased as well. This dust is recycled in order to recover the valuable amount of zinc present in it. In contrast to the increase in dust generation, the capacity of recycling sites has not changed accordingly and there are growing concerns over this imbalance. In the present thesis, logistics and resource allocation of dust recycling in the EU are analysed. Data collected through a questionnaire survey was used to formulate the transportation model of linear programming. The results of the model highlight the location of gaps in recycling capacity and its uneven geographical distribution. The state of the recycling can be improved by research in scrap de-zincing; a process that can recover most of the zinc prior to steelmaking thereby lowering the total amount of dust. To this effect experiments were conducted using electro-galvanized scrap samples in order to study the kinetics of zinc evaporation. Various parameters such as the flow rate of carrier gas, scrap heating rate, packed bed voidage, permeability, and specific surface area were studied with a view of a possible scale-up of the process. The results show that there is a potential of integrating the de-zincing step into high temperature scrap pre-heating processes using shaft type systems that utilize off-gases of steelmaking and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>burners...</b>|$|R

The system {{is based on the}} coupling of innovative solar thermal collectors with a small Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), simultaneously producing electric energy and low temperature heat. The novelty of the proposed system lies in the solar collector field, which is based on stationary evacuated flat-plate solar thermal collectors capable to achieve the operating temperatures typical of the concentrating solar thermal collectors. The solar field consists of about 73. 5 m 2 of flat-plate evacuated solar collectors, heating a diathermic oil up to a maximum temperature of 230 °C. A diathermic oil storage tank is employed in order to mitigate the fluctuations due to the variability of solar energy availability. The hot diathermic oil exiting from the tank passes through an <b>auxiliary</b> gas-fired <b>burner</b> which provides eventual additional thermal energy. The inlet temperature of the diathermic oil entering the ORC system varies {{as a function of the}} availability of solar energy, also determining an oscillating response of the ORC. The ORC was simulated in Engineering Equation Solver (EES), using zero-dimensional energy and mass balances. The ORC model was subsequently implemented in a more general TRNSYS model, including all the remaining components of the system. The model was used to evaluate the energy and economic performance of the solar CHP system under analysis, in different climatic conditions. The results show that the efficiency of the ORC does not significantly vary during the year, remaining always close to 10 %. On the other hand, the efficiency of the solar collectors is very high in summer (> 50 %) and significantly lower during the coldest winter days (down to 20 %). Pay-back periods are extremely attractive in case of feed-in tariffs (about 5 years), whereas the profitability of the system is scarce when no public funding is available. A sensitivity analysis was also performed, in order to determine the combination of system/design parameters able to maximize the thermo-economic performance of the system. It was found that the system may be economically feasible for the majority of locations in the Mediterranean area (pay-back periods around 10 years), whereas the profitability is unsatisfactory for Central-Europe sites...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{treatment}} of waste by incineration is considered an ultimate solution {{in order to get}} rid of waste properly by using the combustible properties of waste and transforming them into inert form and gaseous emission, with the main advantage of a huge reduction in mass and volume of treated waste, destruction of the dangerous components in waste, and obtaining green and clean energy from the exothermal reaction from the completed combustion process. In order to achieve the main goal of incineration, a good design, construction, supervision, and intensive operation and maintenance must be taken into account, especially for the small-scale incinerator. This research will deal with the green, innovative, and eco design and manufacturing technology of a 1 -ton per batch municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerator. The concept design of the incinerator will focus on the design of the feeding process where only one batch of waste will be discharged into the combustion chamber at one time instead of the semi-feed process, as found in the conventional incinerator. This will ease the operation of the operator and reduce the operating cost. Moreover, the innovative design includes the redesign of combustion air injection into either the primary or secondary combustion chamber in order to achieve the 3 Ts of combustion (time, temperature. and turbulence). This design can eliminate the use of an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>burner</b> in the primary combustion chamber. Rethinking the innovative design of using recirculation hot flue gas for preheating of wet garbage in order to pre-dry the waste before combustion is also taken into account.

Key improvements are the integration of thermal energy storage and {{the reduction of the}} operating temperature of the gas turbine to 950 °C. As a result the solar receiver can provide the necessary temperature for solar-only operation of the plant at design point - without using the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>burner.</b> Annual performance calculations and an economic analysis of four different plant concepts were performed. Those concepts were analyzed using innovative power block processes. In general,such systems offer reliable and dispatchable power with low specific CO 2 emissions. A substantial decrease of CO 2 emissions has been achieved all along the four variants compared to results of a previous project [1]. Compared to the defined reference molten salt solar tower the solar-hybrid gas turbine plants as of now yield higher plant efficiencies, but have a slightly lower potential for CO 2 reduction. Among the SHGT plants the variants including a bottoming Organic Rankine Cycle (SHORCC and SHORCC-R) achieve the highest efficiencies but have significantly higher LCOE, caused by the high costs of the ORC components which are not yet commercially available in the requireddimensions. The solar-hybrid combined cycle plant (SHCC) and solar-hybrid gas turbine plant with quasi isothermal compression and recuperation (SHGT-ICR) perform best among the SHGT plants in terms of LCOE, and can be considered an interesting alternative to molten salt tower plants. Taking into account other factors, such as plant complexity and water consumption, an isothermal solar gas turbine plant shows the most potential advantages. However, theSHCC has the highest technological maturity and is a likely candidate for a future demonstration plant...|$|E
40|$|Micro-cogeneration Stirling {{units are}} {{promising}} for residential applications {{because of high}} total efficiencies, favorable ratios of thermal to electrical powers and low CO as well as NOx emissions. This work focuses on the experimental and the numerical analysis of a commercial unit generating 8 kW of hot water (up to 15 kW with an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>burner)</b> and 1 kW of electricity burning natural gas. In the experimental campaign, the initial pressure of the working fluid is changed in a range from 9 to 24 barg – 20 barg being the nominal value – while the inlet temperature of the water loop and its mass flow rate are kept at the nominal conditions of, respectively, 50 °C and 0. 194 kg/s. The experimental results indicate clearly that the initial pressure of the working fluid – Nitrogen – affects strongly the net electrical power output and efficiency. The best performance for the output and efficiency of 943 W and 9. 6 % (based on the higher heating value of the burnt natural gas) are achieved at 22 barg. On the other hand, the thermal power trend indicates a maximum value of 8420 W at the working pressure of 24 barg, which corresponds to a thermal efficiency of 84. 7 % (again based on higher heating value). Measurements are coupled to a detailed model based on a modification of the work by Urieli and Berchowitz. Thanks to the tuning with the experimental results, the numerical model allows investigating the profiles of the main thermodynamic parameters and heat losses during the cycle, as well as estimating those physical properties that are not directly measurable.

40|$|Industrial {{activities}} cause {{a variety}} of environmental problems. These are largely caused by emissions of air pollutants, the production of waste and depletion of natural resources. As a consequence, industrial managers face a complex problem when assessing the overall environmental pressure on the environment, and options to reduce this pressure. This complexity {{is associated with the}} range of activities taking place in industrial processes, the variety and complexity of their environmental effects, the number of available technologies for pollution control, and the costs of pollution reduction. Despite this complexity, pollution reduction in industry is not always based on systematic analyses, nor on clearly defined company priorities to environmental management. An important reason for this is a lack of integrated analyses of the environmental impact of industrial processes, the options to reduce this impact and the associated costs. An instrument to assist plant managers in deciding on environmental management is of utmost importance. However, a decision support tool that takes a company perspective and covers all relevant environmental issues as well as costs of environmental management is currently not available in the literature. The overall objective of the thesis is to develop a decision support tool to analyse options to reduce the environmental impact of an industrial company. A model is developed for the assessment of the potential environmental impact resulting from emissions of environmental pollutants, as well as the effectiveness of reduction options and the associated costs. The tool aims to take a company perspective and to assist the company management in the analyses of possible strategies to improve the company's environmental performance. An industrial plant, supplying the automotive industry with aluminium pressure die casting products, located in Portugal, served as case study. The following research questions are addressed:   1)        What existing environmental systems analysis methods and tools can in principle be combined in a decision support tool and used to analyse the environmental performance of a plant from a company perspective? Which technical pollution reduction options are available for reducing the environmental impact of an aluminium pressure die casting plant? What are their technical potentials to reduce this impact, and the associated costs for the plant? How can a model be developed that can be used from a company perspective to analyse options to reduce the environmental impact of aluminium pressure die casting? How do different strategies to combine pollution reduction options improve the environmental performance of an aluminium pressure die casting plant, and what are the associated costs for the plant? Environmental systems analysis (ESA) is often used to assist decision making in finding solution to complex environmental problems. A systems analysis research strategy is followed to address the above formulated research questions. It is based on a stepwise approach consisting of: 1) Problem definition; 2) Evaluation and selection of existing ESA tools; 3) Identification of pollution reduction options; 4) Model building; 5) Model application and finally 6) Evaluation of the methodological approach. In this environmental systems analysis, seven analytical tools are combined. These are {{selected on the basis of}} criteria ensuring an analysis that takes a company perspective; includes environmental and economic aspects of decision making; includes a complete coverage of the potential environmental impacts and allows for an assessment of the consequences of pollution reduction strategies. The associated characteristics of the decision support tool to be developed are that it i) considers a gate-to-gate approach; ii) considers the processes within the plant that are relevant for the assessment of the environmental impact; iii) uses plant specific data easily available from the process owner; iv) considers up-to-date and plant specific pollution reduction options; v) provides information on the cost-effectiveness of the reduction options; vi) can be used to express the environmental performance in one overall environmental   indicator; and vii) can be used to explore possible user-defined pollution reduction strategies. Based on these characteristics the following analytical tools are considered useful for the purpose of this study: Life Cycle Assessment, Substance Flow Analysis, Multi-Criteria Analysis, Technology Assessment, Sensitivity Analysis, Scenario Analysis and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis. Next, 18 pollution reduction options are identified for the aluminium pressure die casting plant studied. For each option the potential to reduce the pollution and the costs associated with their implementation is estimated. The options include typical end-of-pipe solutions, as well as more structural changes in the industrial processes. The options are considered the best available for the current aluminium pressure die casting sector. The inventory shows that promising and effective opportunities exist for pollution reduction.   A model (MIKADO) is developed for and applied to the specific aluminium die casting plant. MIKADO is the Model of the environmental Impact of an Aluminium Die casting plant and Options to reduce this impact. The model includes material and energy flows in the plant that give rise to environmental problems. It considers the following sub-processes: Melting; Casting; Finishing; Internal Transports and <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Burners.</b> MIKADO can be used to analyse future trends in the potential environmental impact of the aluminium pressure die casting plant and the effect of different pollution reduction strategies, as well as the costs for the company. One of the strengths of MIKADO is the integrated approach that it takes in analysing, simultaneously, all the relevant environmental problems caused by the aluminium die casting plant. MIKADO results are first analysed for the situation that reflects the current practice in the plant. In addition, a partial sensitivity analysis performed to study the sensitivity of MIKADO results to changes in parameter values. The results indicate that more than 90 % of the environmental impact of the company is from the sub-processes Melting and Casting. Moreover, the environmental impact caused by the plant is mostly associated with human toxicity problems (caused by metal emissions, and emissions of ozone precursors) and the depletion of natural gas. Four relatively larger sources of environmental pollution include the use of natural gas and emissions of hydrogen fluoride in Melting, and emission of chromium and non-methane volatile organic compounds from Casting. These four cause about two-thirds of the overall environmental impact. MIKADO results show to be relatively insensitive to the valuation factors used to assess the overall environmental impact. A systematic analysis of the pollution reduction options reveals that the potential to reduce pollution varies largely for the 18 options analysed. Individual options may reduce the overall environmental impact by up to 40 %. The most effective single options, leading to the largest reductions, are found to be two wet scrubbers associated to Casting. The costs to implement reduction options differ largely. Six options have net negative costs, implying that the company may in fact earn money by implementing them. These include the use of a granular desoxidation agent, reduction of the scrap produced during Casting and Finishing, the use of electric forklift trucks in internal transport, a new mould release agent and compacting the metal load entering the melting furnaces. The last option is found to be the most paying. Seven different types of reduction strategies are analysed, assuming the simultaneous implementation of different pollution reduction options. These strategies, reflecting different environmental management objectives, are analysed with respect to their potential to reduce the environmental impact and the costs associated with the implementation of options. The strategies differ largely with respect to their effect on the environmental impact (10 - 87 % reduction) and costs (- 268 to + 277 kEuro/year). The most effective strategy is a combination of options to reduce human toxicity, but this is also a relatively costly strategy. The least effective is related to metal yield increase. Combining the most paying options is an interesting strategy: it reduces the overall environmental impact by 45 % at negative net costs (- 268 kEuro/year). Eleven strategies could be defined which reduce the overall environmental impact by more than 50 %. Of these two have net negative costs. It is also possible to reduce largely the environmental impact in the case in which the costs of add-on techniques are compensated by benefits of the paying options. This is, for instance, the case when most cost effective options are combined. Results show a large reduction in the overall environmental impact (86 % reduction), while the company gains 51 kEuro/year. Novel aspects of this thesis include: 1) the company perspective that it takes; 2) the involvement of plant managers throughout the research; 3) the environmental systems analysis research strategy (sequence of environmental systems analysis steps and iterations), and 4) the selection of environmental systems analyses tools. The company perspective taken when developing MIKADO is reflected by the definition of system boundaries, the production processes included and the pollution reduction options considered in the model characteristics. The decision support tool only considers the industrial processes that can be managed by the plant managers, as well as the different types of environmental problems that the plant contributes to (air emissions, liquid effluents, solid wastes and natural resources used within the plant gates). The involvement of plant managers during MIKADO development was essential for ensuring that the tool to support decision making fulfils their expectations on the assessment of the environmental performance of the plant. A major strength of the tool developed to plant managers is its flexibility. This flexibility contributes to the willingness of the plant manager to use MIKADO to analyse possibilities for environmental management in the plant. The research strategy taken in this thesis includes a unique sequence of steps and iterations and is considered the appropriate and useful for development of decision support tools for environmental management in industrial companies. The environmental systems analysis procedure followed here may also be useful in assisting environmental decision making by other industries. Finally, the procedure to select analytical tools as a basis for the model was helpful. The detailed description of the procedure followed and the resulting combination of the analytical tools may serve as an example for other studies. This also holds for the combination of seven different environmental systems analysis tools, as presented in this thesis...|$|R

Fuel cells are a promising approach to high-efficiency power generation, as they directly convert chemical energy to electric work. High-temperature fuel cells such as the SOFC can be integrated in gas turbine processes, which further increases the electrical efficiency to values up to 70 %. However, {{there are a number}} of obstacles for safe operation of such a system, such as fuel cell damage through thermal loads or undesired chemical reactions, or gas turbine problems related to high thermal capacity and volume of the pressurised components. Development of suitable plant design as well as operation and control strategies is hence a key task for realisation of the mentioned systems. The first part of the thesis describes the utilised models. All component models that have been developed and applied for the work are mathematically defined based on a fixed pattern. The thermodynamically most relevant components are tubular SOFC, indirect internal reformer and heat exchangers, and spatially discretised models are used for these. For the turbomachinery, map-based steady-state behaviour is modelled. Gas residence times and pressure drops are accounted for in all components they are relevant. Based on the component models, three different hybrid cycles are examined. In the first cycle, the SOFC replaces the combustion chamber of a recuperated single-shaft turbine. The SOFC is pressurised and the cycle is called “directly integrated SOFC cycle” (DIC). Further cycle options are a DIC with a two-shaft gas turbine (DIC- 2 T) and an indirectly integrated SOFC cycle (IIC). In the latter, the compressed gas is heated recuperatively with the exhaust gas and the SOFC is operated at ambient pressure by connecting its air inlet to the turbine exhaust. All cycles incorporate the SOFC system design proposed by Siemens-Westinghouse, including indirect internal reforming, a tubular SOFC bundle and anode recirculation by an ejector. The first cycle (DIC) is regarded as standard cycle. Objectives for highly efficient, safe system design are formulated and design parameters are associated. A design calculation determines the design parameters for the standard cycle, based on a nominal power output of 220 kW. The design LHVbased electric efficiency is app. 63 %. Related to the design point, steady-state part-load ability of the system is analysed and displayed in two-dimensional performance maps where each axis represents one degree of freedom. Degrees of freedom considered are fuel and air flow; fuel utilisation is assumed constant. A result is that a strategy with constant mean fuel cell temperature is most advantageous in terms of safe and gentle operation. Further advantages of this strategy are the ability for low part-load and high efficiency at part-load operation. A control strategy is derived for dynamical implementation of the found part-load strategy. The system power output is primarily controlled by the SOFC power. The fuel utilisation is kept within certain bounds and the fuel flow is manipulated to control it to its design value. The fuel cell temperature is controlled by the air flow, which again is controlled by manipulating the GT shaft speed through the generator power. To determine the required air flow, a mixed feedforward and feedback strategy is used, where the feedforward part calculates a prediction based on the net power output and the feedback part provides correction based on the measurement of the SOFC fuel outlet temperature. Additional constraints to the control system are the supervision of the shaft speed and the valid operation regime of the anode recirculation ejector. The proposed control strategy provides robust control. The mean SOFC temperature, however, shows large transient deviation upon large load steps. The time to reach the setpoint power for large load steps is up to 70 s, while small load steps are followed in typically 1 - 2 s. A conclusion is that the system is suitable for load following operation as long as small load steps occur, as for example in distributed power generation for residential applications. Shutdown and startup strategies are introduced where the gas turbine provides air for cooling/heating throughout the procedures. Additional equipment and piping such as an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>burner,</b> a turbine exhaust throttle, a bypass around the recuperative heat exchanger as well as nitrogen and hydrogen supply and mixing units are required. Therewith, smooth cooling/heating of the cell can be accomplished without external electric power, but with a considerable amount of fuel and flushing nitrogen required. A further analysis investigates fuel flexibility of a system designed for methane: Hydrogen can be utilised without larger system modifications; only the control system characteristics must be adapted. Because no endothermic steam reforming takes place, the power output is, however, reduced to 70 % of the original value, and efficiency is reduced to 55 %. Applying the additional equipment required for shutdown/startup, the power can be increased to 94 % of the original value, although at a further efficiency decrease. In order to use ethanol as fuel in the ejector-driven anode, a recuperative vaporiser must be applied in the fuel channel. Supposed that reliable reforming catalysts for ethanol can be provided, 88 % of the original power output can be achieved at a high efficiency of 62 %. The investigation of the other cycle options reveals that a two turbine cycle where the power turbine is rotating at constant speed, mostly differs in terms of controllability. For controlling the air flow, another handle such as variable inlet guide vanes or air bypass around the SOFC system is required. The indirectly integrated SOFC cycle (IIC) has a significantly lower efficiency of only 56 %, assuming the SOFC at the same temperature level than in the DIC.
