5|$|Learning that James {{seeks to}} revive the project and {{continue}} his work by acquiring a Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.), the Lone Wanderer soon tracks him down to Vault 112, and frees him from a virtual reality program being run by the Vault's sadistic Overseer, Dr. Stanislaus Braun, whom James had sought out for information on a G.E.C.K.. Reunited with their father, the pair soon return to Rivet City and recruit Li and the other project members to resume work at the Jefferson Memorial. Just as they begin testing the project, the Memorial is invaded by the Enclave, a powerful military organization formed from {{the remnants of the}} pre-War United States government, which continues to remain active despite the demise of their brethren on the West Coast thirty years previously (see Fallout 2). Seeking to stop them gaining control of his work, James urges the Lone Wanderer to finish his work and find a G.E.C.K. before flooding the project's control room with massive amounts of radiation, preventing the Enclave's military leader, Colonel Augustus Autumn, from taking control of it and killing himself in the process, though Autumn survives. Taking the remaining project members to safety, the Lone Wanderer makes contact with the Brotherhood of Steel within the ruins of the Pentagon, now known as the Citadel. With their help, the Lone Wanderer travels to Vault 87 to find a G.E.C.K., which had been used as a testing site for the Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV) <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>as</b> a breeding ground for the Super Mutants. The Lone Wanderer recovers the G.E.C.K. from within the Vault. But as they make their way out, the Wanderer is ambushed by Colonel Autumn and the Enclave and is captured.|$|E

5|$|The fortifications {{had only}} {{relatively}} thin crenelated walls, which were insufficiently strong to counter artillery bombardments. They {{were lined with}} many tall towers for archers, but {{could not be used}} to mount cannon. Don Luis Bravo de Acuña, the governor of Gibraltar, produced a report for the king recommending a series of changes to the territory's fortifications. A series of new batteries was built along the Line Wall, each named after saints, and a New Mole (later renamed the South Mole) was built to provide additional protection to ships in the harbour. On the north side of Gibraltar, the Muralla de San Bernando (now the Grand Battery) was fully adapted to mount cannon facing the isthmus with the old archery towers being pulled down and replaced by bastions. The Old Mole, stretching into the Bay of Gibraltar, provided further mountings for cannon to sweep the isthmus. A series of defensive works constructed on a glacis above the entrance to the town provided further enfilading fire. A formidable bastion was constructed to protect the south of the town; known as the Baluarte de Nuestra Señora del Rosario ("Bastion of Our Lady of the Rosary"), <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>as</b> the South Bastion, it enfiladed the ditch across the Gate of Africa, now the Southport Gates. However, the effectiveness of the new fortifications was undermined by the continued failure of the Spanish crown to provide enough troops to man them.|$|E

25|$|In 1987, the NZRFU {{wrote to}} the International Rugby Football Board, later known as the International Rugby Board (IRB) <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>as</b> World Rugby, {{requesting}} the possibility of hosting an inaugural Rugby World Cup. The 1987 World Cup was eventually given to both New Zealand and Australia. The All Blacks {{made it to the}} final, where they would meet France. The All Blacks won and were crowned the first ever World Champions. In the 1980s, New Zealand provincial sides participated in the South Pacific Championship, along with teams from Australia and Fiji. In 1992 this type of competition was relaunched as the Super Sixes, and was expanded to the Super 10 later. As rugby entered the professional era in the mid-1990s, along with South Africa and Australia, New Zealand formed SANZAR, which would see them start a provincial rugby competition, the Super 12. The 1996 Super 12 season saw the Auckland Blues finish in second place, whilst the Waikato Chiefs 6th, the Otago Highlanders 8th, the Wellington Hurricanes 9th, and the Canterbury Crusaders 12th. The SANZAR agreement also saw the formation of the Tri Nations Series, a contest between the respective national sides, the All Blacks, Springboks and Wallabies. The All Blacks won the first series. Beginning in 2012, the Argentina Pumas entered the competition, which was renamed The Rugby Championship. New Zealand was supposed to jointly host the 2003 World Cup with Australia, but a disagreement with the IRB saw the tournament given to Australia in its entirety. In 2006, New Zealand won the right to host the 2011 World Cup.|$|E
