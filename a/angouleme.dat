5|$|A {{conflict}} between the new papal legate, Peter of Capua, and the Latin Patriarch of Antioch, Peter of <b>Angoulême,</b> who had become Raymond-Roupen's supporter, ended with the excommunication of the patriarch. Exploiting the situation {{to get rid of}} his opponent, Bohemond replaced Peter of <b>Angoulême</b> with the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, SymeonII {{with the support of the}} commune in early 1207. Peter of <b>Angoulême</b> was reconciled with the legate, excommunicated Bohemond and the commune, and then persuaded some nobles to rise up against Bohemond, forcing him to take refuge in the citadel. Leo entered Antioch, but Bohemond collected his forces and defeated the Armenians. Peter of <b>Angoulême</b> was captured and died of drink deprivation in his prison.|$|E
5|$|In honour of Hergé's legacy, {{the awards}} handed {{out at the}} <b>Angoulême</b> International Comics Festival were named Alph-Art Awards.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond {{had already}} been on bad terms with Peter of <b>Angoulême,</b> Latin Patriarch of Antioch. Taking {{advantage}} of a conflict between the patriarch and the papal legate, Peter Capuano, Bohemond restored the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, Symeon II, in early 1206 or 1207. Peter of <b>Angoulême</b> and the papal legate were reconciled and the patriarch excommunicated Bohemond, Symeon and the commune {{with the approval of}} the Holy See. He also imposed an interdict on Antioch, but the burghers ignored his decision and visited the Greek churches.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{was born}} at the Château d'Angoulême, in <b>Angoulême,</b> then part of the Duchy of Aquitaine. His name, Edward of <b>Angoulême,</b> is a {{territorial}} designation referring to his birthplace; this was a common naming practice in 14th-century England. Through his father, Edward, the Black Prince, {{he was a member}} of the House of Plantagenet and the second, but eldest surviving grandson of the reigning English monarch, Edward III. Edward was related to the reigning French royal House of Valois through his paternal grandmother, Philippa of Hainault. His mother, Joan, was his father's first cousin once removed, and was suo jure Countess of Kent.|$|E
5|$|The château, a {{few miles}} north of <b>Angoulême</b> and in fact in Angoumois, was later used as the country seat of the La Rochefoucauld family.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, the Saint Young Men manga {{has sold}} over 10 million copies. Individual {{volumes of the}} series have {{frequently}} appeared on lists of the weekly and annual best-seller manga in Japan. It received a Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize and was nominated at the <b>Angoulême</b> International Comics Festival. Its film adaptation has been well received by the Japanese public.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII {{negotiated}} Marie-Thérèse's {{release from}} her Paris prison in 1795. He desperately {{wanted her to}} marry her first cousin, Louis-Antoine, Duke of <b>Angoulême,</b> {{the son of the}} Count of Artois. Louis XVIII deceived his niece by telling her that her parents' last wishes were for her to marry Louis Antoine, and she duly agreed to her uncle-king's wishes.|$|E
5|$|Peter of <b>Angoulême</b> helped Raymond-Roupen's {{supporters}} {{to return from}} Cilicia to Antioch in late 1207. Surprised by the coup, Bohemond sought refuge in the citadel. Although Leo of Cilicia also entered the town, Bohemond was able to muster his troops and defeat his enemies. He captured and imprisoned the Latin patriarch who refused to acknowledge him as the lawful prince. After Peter of <b>Angoulême</b> died of thirst, Pope Innocent III ordered Albert Avogadro, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, to excommunicate Bohemond. Bohemond continued to support the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch and did not allow Peter of Ivrea, the new Latin Patriarch of Antioch, to visit his see. He also debated {{the right of the}} Holy See to make a judgement about the succession in Antioch, stating that the principality was a fief of the Latin Emperors of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|The Château de Verteuil is {{recorded}} in 1080 as {{the property of}} the Lord of La Rochefoucauld. Since then the castle has almost always belonged to a member of this family. The first recorded successful siege was in 1135, by Count Wulgrin II of <b>Angoulême</b> (–1140), when the castle belonged to Aymar II de la Rochefoucauld. Hostilities continued between their descendants, William VI of <b>Angoulême</b> (died 1179) and Guy IV of la Rochefoucauld, but had ceased by 1170 when they both attended the dedication of the church of Saint-Amant-de-Boixe. Louis VII of France (1120–80) and Eleanor of Aquitaine (1122–1204) may have stayed at Verteuil in 1137. Eleanor's mother was a Rochefoucauld, and due to the unsettled state of the country the young couple only stayed in safe and preferably well-fortified places in their journey from Bordeaux to Paris.|$|E
5|$|The new peace {{would only}} last for two years; war recommenced in the {{aftermath}} of John's decision in August 1200 to marry Isabella of <b>Angoulême.</b> In order to remarry, John first needed to abandon Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, his first wife; John accomplished this by arguing that he had failed to get the necessary papal permission to marry Isabel in the first place – as a cousin, John could not have legally wed her without this. It remains unclear why John chose to marry Isabella of <b>Angoulême.</b> Contemporary chroniclers argued that John had fallen deeply in love with Isabella, and John may have been motivated by desire for an apparently beautiful, if rather young, girl. On the other hand, the Angoumois lands that came with Isabella were strategically vital to John: by marrying Isabella, John was acquiring a key land route between Poitou and Gascony, which significantly strengthened his grip on Aquitaine.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} ecclesiastics died at or {{shortly after the}} council, {{including}} Robert de Bethune, the Bishop of Hereford, who fell ill {{on the third day}} of the council and died on either 14 or 16 April 1148. The Bishop of <b>Angouleme</b> died in June, after attending the council. The Archbishop of Trier, Albero de Montreuil, was so ill he was carried to the council on a horse litter.|$|E
5|$|Berry was {{the only}} member of the family thought to be able to beget children. His wife gave birth to a posthumous son in September, Henry, Duke of Bordeaux, nicknamed Dieudonné (God-given) by the Bourbons because he was thought to have secured the future of the dynasty. However the Bourbon {{succession}} was still in doubt. The Chamber of Deputies proposed amending Salic law to allow the Duchess of <b>Angoulême</b> to accede to the throne. On 12 June 1820, the Chambers ratified legislation that increased the number of deputies from 258 to 430. The extra deputies were to be elected by the wealthiest quarter of the population in each département. These individuals now effectively had two votes. Around the same time as the “law of the two votes”, Louis XVIII began to receive visits every Wednesday from a lady named Zoé Talon, and ordered that nobody should disturb him while he was with her. It was rumoured that he inhaled snuff from her breasts, which earned her the nickname of tabatière (snuffbox). In 1823, France embarked on a military intervention in Spain, where a revolt had occurred against the King Ferdinand VII. France succeeded in crushing the rebellion, an effort headed by the Duke of <b>Angoulême.</b>|$|E
5|$|John's first wife, Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, was {{released}} from imprisonment in 1214; she remarried twice, and died in 1217. John's second wife, Isabella of <b>Angoulême,</b> left England for <b>Angoulême</b> soon after the king's death; she became a powerful regional leader, but largely abandoned the children she had had by John. John had five legitimate children, all by Isabella. His eldest son, Henry III, ruled as King of England {{for the majority of}} the 13th century. Richard became a noted European leader and ultimately the King of the Romans in the Holy Roman Empire. Joan became Queen of Scotland on her marriage to Alexander II. Isabella was Holy Roman Empress as the wife of Frederick II. His youngest daughter, Eleanor, married William Marshal's son, also called William, and later the famous English rebel Simon de Montfort. John had a number of illegitimate children by various mistresses, including nine sons – Richard, Oliver, John, Geoffrey, Henry, Osbert Gifford, Eudes, Bartholomew and probably Philip – and three daughters – Joan, Maud and probably Isabel. Of these, Joan became the most famous, marrying Prince Llywelyn the Great of Wales.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII {{was forced}} {{once again to}} leave Jelgava when Alexander of Russia {{informed}} him that his safety could not be guaranteed on continental Europe. In July 1807, Louis boarded a Swedish frigate to Stockholm, bringing with him only the Duke of <b>Angoulême.</b> Louis did not stay in Sweden for long; he arrived in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, England, in November 1807. He took up residence in Gosfield Hall, leased {{to him by the}} Marquess of Buckingham.|$|E
5|$|The Count of Artois ruled as Lieutenant-General of {{the kingdom}} until his brother's arrival in Paris on 3 May. Upon his return, the king {{displayed}} himself to his subjects by creating a procession through the city. He took up residence in the Tuileries Palace the same day. His niece, the Duchess of <b>Angoulême,</b> fainted {{at the sight of}} the Tuileries, where she had lived during the time of the French Revolution.|$|E
5|$|The Rochefoucaulds, who {{had played}} a major role in the fight against the English, now began to ravish <b>Angoulême.</b> Charles VII returned, and this time {{destroyed}} the castle, largely by fire. However, the stones were recovered and the castle rebuilt. In 1446 the Rochefoucaulds managed to obtain the king's pardon and permission to build a defensive wall and two towers in Verteuil to restore the traditional refuge of the villagers. Under this pretext they made the castle among the best defended in France.|$|E
5|$|Ernouf {{was on an}} {{inspection}} away from this command when Napoleon landed at Cannes. Upon his landing, many of the soldiers of Angoulême's army flocked to Bonaparte's banner, beginning the Hundred Days. The mere news of Napoleon's escape from Elba and the defection {{of some of the}} troops caused Charles, Duke of <b>Angoulême,</b> to panic and capitulate. Ernouf returned to Marseille, where he learned that André Masséna also had chosen the imperial cause, after which he left for Paris. Napoleon rescinded Ernouf's honors and titles, and dismissed him from his post in the military on 15April 1815. After Napoleon's final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, the second restoration of the Bourbons that summer also restored Ernouf's rights and property.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was born}} in Winchester Castle on 1 October 1207. He was the eldest son of King John and Isabella of <b>Angoulême.</b> Little is known of Henry's early life. He was {{initially}} looked after by a wet nurse called Ellen {{in the south of}} England, away from John's itinerant court, and probably had close ties to his mother. Henry had four legitimate younger brothers and sisters – Richard, Joan, Isabella and Eleanor – and various older illegitimate siblings. In 1212 his education was entrusted to Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester; under his direction, Henry was given military training by Philip D'Aubigny and taught to ride, probably by Ralph of St Samson.|$|E
5|$|In August, {{elections}} for the Chamber of Deputies returned unfavourable results for Talleyrand. The ministry wished for moderate deputies, but the electorate voted almost exclusively for ultra-royalists, resulting in the so-called Chambre introuvable. The Duchess of <b>Angoulême</b> and the Count of Artois pressured King Louis for the dismissal of his obsolete ministry. Talleyrand tendered his resignation on 20 September. Louis XVIII chose the Duke of Richelieu to be his new Prime Minister. Richelieu was chosen because he was accepted by Louis's family and the reactionary Chamber of Deputies.|$|E
5|$|Henry III (1 October 1207– 16 November 1272), {{also known}} as Henry of Winchester, was King of England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Aquitaine from 1216 until his death. The son of King John and Isabella of <b>Angoulême,</b> Henry assumed the throne {{when he was only}} nine {{in the middle of the}} First Barons' War. Cardinal Guala {{declared}} the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by William Marshal, defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225, which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons. His early rule was dominated first by Hubert de Burgh and then Peter des Roches, who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230, the King attempted to reconquer the provinces of France that had once belonged to his father, but the invasion was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, Richard, broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church.|$|E
5|$|John's {{personal}} life greatly affected his reign. Contemporary chroniclers state that John was sinfully lustful {{and lacking in}} piety. It was common for kings and nobles of the period to keep mistresses, but chroniclers complained that John's mistresses were married noblewomen, which was considered unacceptable. John had at least five children with mistresses during his first marriage to Isabelle of Gloucester, and two of those mistresses {{are known to have}} been noblewomen. John's behaviour after his second marriage to Isabella of <b>Angoulême</b> is less clear, however. None of John's known illegitimate children were born after he remarried, and there is no actual documentary proof of adultery after that point, although John certainly had female friends amongst the court throughout the period. The specific accusations made against John during the baronial revolts are now generally considered to have been invented for the purposes of justifying the revolt; nonetheless, most of John's contemporaries seem to have held a poor opinion of his sexual behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII {{admitted}} the Count of Artois and his nephews the Dukes of <b>Angoulême</b> and Berry into the king's council in May 1814, upon its establishment. The council was informally headed by Prince Talleyrand. Louis XVIII took a large {{interest in the}} goings-on of the Congress of Vienna (set up to redraw the map of Europe after Napoleon's demise). Talleyrand represented France at the proceedings. Louis was horrified by Prussia's intention to annex the Kingdom of Saxony, {{to which he was}} attached because his mother was born a Saxon princess, and he was also concerned that Prussia would dominate Germany. He also wished the Duchy of Parma to be restored to the Parmese Bourbons, and not to Empress Marie Louise of France, as was being suggested by the Allies. Louis also protested the Allies' inaction in Naples, where he wanted the Napoleonic usurper Joachim Murat removed in favour of the Neapolitan Bourbons.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{was born}} at the Archbishop's Palace, Bordeaux, in the English principality of Aquitaine, on 6 January 1367. According to {{contemporary}} sources, three kings"the King of Castille, the King of Navarre and the King of Portugal"were present at his birth. This anecdote, {{and the fact that}} his birth fell on the feast of Epiphany, was later used in the religious imagery of the Wilton Diptych, where Richard is one of three kings paying homage to the Virgin and Child. His elder brother Edward of <b>Angoulême</b> died near his sixth birthday in 1371, and Richard became his father's heir. The Black Prince finally succumbed to his long illness in June 1376. The Commons in parliament genuinely feared that Richard's uncle, John of Gaunt, would usurp the throne. For this reason, the prince was quickly invested with the princedom of Wales and his father's other titles.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 {{release of}} Jaojoby's first {{full-length}} album, titled Salegy!, was facilitated by fRoots magazine editor Ian Anderson, {{who had worked}} with Jaojoby to record several of his tracks for a radio broadcast two years previously. Jaojoby's second album, Velono, was the first salegy album to be recorded in France, as well as the first of his albums to be produced in a professional-quality recording studio. Following the 1994 release of Velono, Jaojoby became a regular on the international music festival circuit and has performed at such events as WOMAD in Reading, the Festival du Bout du Monde in Brittany, WOMEX in Spain, the Festival des Musiques Métisses in <b>Angoulême,</b> the MASA Festival in Abidjan, and similar events in Germany, the Netherlands, and Portugal. Jaojoby's excitement over his rise to international celebrity was attenuated by the 1995 death of the band's original drummer, Jean-Claude Djaonarana, who had first performed with Jaojoby as a member of Los Matadores.|$|E
5|$|When the barons of England revolted against John in 1215, Maulay {{was given}} command of Corfe Castle by John. Along with Corfe, Maulay was also given custody of John's younger son, Richard of Cornwall. He was also given Gomshall in Surrey. In 1216 {{he was given}} the office of Sheriff of Dorset and Somerset, where he {{made a name for himself}} with his exactions and heavy profiteering. Besides the custody of Richard of Cornwall, Maulay was also {{responsible}} for supervising the confinement of John's niece, Eleanor of Brittany, who, as the daughter of Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, elder brother of King John, had a strong claim to the English throne and had been held captive since 1202. At times, he was also responsible for keeping John's wife, Isabella of <b>Angouleme</b> and his heir, Prince Henry, safe from rebels, as long as they were at Corfe.|$|E
5|$|Aymer {{was the son}} of William de Valence, son of Hugh X, Count of La Marche and Isabella of <b>Angoulême.</b> William was Henry III's {{half-brother}} {{through his}} mother’s prior marriage to King John, and as such gained a central position in the Kingdom of England. He had come to the earldom of Pembroke through his marriage to Joan de Munchensi, granddaughter of William Marshal. Aymer was the third son of his family, so little is known of his birth and early years. He {{is believed to have been}} born some time between 1270 and 1275. As his father was on crusade with Lord Edward until January 1273, a date towards the end of this period is more likely. With the death in battle in Wales of his remaining brother William in 1282 (John, the elder brother, was dead in 1277), Aymer found himself heir to the Earldom of Pembroke. William de Valence died in 1296, and Aymer inherited his father's French lands, but had to wait until his mother died in 1307 to succeed to the Earldom. Through inheritance and marriages his lands consisted of– apart from the county palatine in Pembrokeshire– property spread out across England primarily in a strip from Gloucestershire to East Anglia, in south-east Ireland (Wexford), and French lands in the Poitou- and Calais areas.|$|E
5|$|The final straw was Henry's {{decision}} {{to give his}} youngest son John three major castles belonging to Young Henry, who first protested and then fled to Paris, followed by his brothers Richard and Geoffrey; Eleanor attempted to join them but was captured by Henry's forces in November. Louis supported Young Henry and war became imminent. Young Henry wrote to the pope, complaining about his father's behaviour, and began to acquire allies, including King William of Scotland and the Counts of Boulogne, Flanders and Blois—all of whom were promised lands if Young Henry won. Major baronial revolts broke out in England, Brittany, Maine, Poitou and <b>Angoulême.</b> In Normandy some of the border barons rose up and, {{although the majority of}} the duchy remained openly loyal, there {{appears to have been a}} wider undercurrent of discontent. Only Anjou proved relatively secure. Despite the size and scope of the crisis, Henry had several advantages, including his control of a large number of powerful royal castles in strategic areas, control of most of the English ports throughout the war, and his continuing popularity within the towns across his empire.|$|E

25|$|It {{was this}} feat that {{earned him the}} name Taillefer, which was borne by all his {{descendants}} until Isabella of <b>Angoulême</b> who was also known as Isabelle Taillefer, the wife of King John of England.
