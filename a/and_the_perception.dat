5|$|The {{extent of}} Rommel's {{involvement}} in the military's resistance against Hitler or the 20 July plot is difficult to ascertain, as people most directly involved did not survive, and limited documentation of the conspirators' plans and preparations exists. Thus, Rommel's participation remains ambiguous, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of it largely has its source in subsequent events, (especially Rommel's forced suicide), and the post-war accounts by surviving participants.|$|E
5|$|A new Prisons Act {{was passed}} in 1981, which updated the 1903 act and its eleven {{amendments}} with modern philosophies and practices – codifying departmental orders, instructions, and policy documents. The act was, however, slanted towards prisoner management and safety, as the government and opposition were mindful of public opinion, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of lax security at Fremantle. The result was legislation criticised by the Criminal Lawyers Association, academics, and newspapers, including for minimal welfare provisions that did little to ensure prisoner welfare. The department was {{at the same time}} renamed the Prisons Department once more, to emphasise imprisonment as its primary responsibility.|$|E
40|$|In 2004, {{parents and}} {{teachers}} from selected Title I schools in Miami-Dade County Public Schools (M-DCPS), Miami, Florida were surveyed {{to determine the extent}} to which their perceptions of school quality in high-performing high-minority high-poverty schools compared to <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents <b>and</b> teachers in low-performing high-minority high-poverty schools. Data were collected from 718 parents and 111 teachers by means of a written survey— School Effectiveness Questionnaire published by The Psychological Corporation (Baldwin, et al., 1998). Three research questions were answered by testing 21 hypotheses. Mean scores, paired-sample t-test, Multiple Analysis of Variances (MANOVA) and descriptive comparative statistics were used. Based on the statistical treatment, the following conclusions appear warranted: (1) Significant differences existed in <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in high-performing schools <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in low-performing schools with respect to clear and focused mission. (2) Significant differences existed in <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in high-performing schools <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in low-performing schools with respect to assessment and monitoring of students achievement. (3) Significant differences existed in <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in high-performing schools <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in low-performing schools with respect to parent/community participation. (4) Significant differences existed in <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in high-performing schools <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in low-performing schools with respect to safe and orderly environment. (5) Significant differences existed in <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in high-performing schools <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in low-performing schools with respect to teachers taking part in decision-making and teachers having control over portions of the school 2 ̆ 7 s instructional budget. (6) Significant differences existed in <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in high-performing schools <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in low-performing schools with respect to increased opportunities for student. (7) Parents in the low-performing schools rated 7 of the 9 attributes as needing attention, except for High Expectations (x¯ = 4. 06) and Emphasis on Basic Skills (x¯ = 4. 25). (8) Teachers in low-performing schools rated 9 of the 11 attributes of school effectiveness as needing attention except for Clear and Focused Mission (x¯ = 4. 21) and Professional Development (x¯ = 4. 06). (9) Parents in high-performing schools rated their schools higher compared to parents in low-performing schools. (10) Teachers in high-performing schools rated their schools higher compared to teachers in low-performing schools except for Frequent Assessment (x¯ = 3. 96), and Parent/Community Participation (x¯ = 3. 95). ...|$|R

5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of the bird's size.|$|E
5|$|Nolan North, {{the voice}} actor who played Drake, {{had a large}} role in {{defining}} the character's physical and vocal reactions. In the Uncharted series, the actors were used for motion capture, and acted as if performing in a movie. Motion capture was done on a soundstage, and the dialog recorded during this process was used in the game. North was allowed to ad-lib dialog and insert aspects of his own personality into the character. In naming the character, the development team considered many different choices, including Ethan, Samuel, and John. Matthew Drake was seriously contemplated, but received a poor reaction from those it was presented to. Eventually, Naughty Dog settled on the name Nathan for its ability to be shortened to Nate, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> that it sounded historical. Drake's character design changed little between Drake's Fortune and Among Thieves.|$|E
5|$|On {{her return}} to Australian waters, several sailors aboard the warship mutinied after a request for an extra day's leave in Fremantle was denied, {{although}} other issues {{played a part in}} the mutiny, including minimal leave during the war, problems with pay, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> that Royal Navy personnel were more likely to receive promotions than Australian sailors. Post-war budget cuts saw Australias role downgraded to a training ship before she was placed in reserve in 1921. The disarmament provisions of the Washington Naval Treaty required the destruction of Australia as part of the British Empire's commitment, and she was scuttled off Sydney Heads in 1924.|$|E

5|$|One colonist at Wessagusset, {{seeing these}} signs and other {{indications}} of hostility, fled to Plymouth to bring word of an imminent attack. Adding to his desperation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of imminent hostility, he was pursued by natives during his flight. Arriving at Plymouth on March 24, {{he met with}} the Governor and town council. It is unclear whether this colonist's report was the tipping point, or whether Plymouth had already decided to mount a preemptive attack. Plymouth's Edward Winslow had recently been warned by Massasoit, a sachem whose life he saved using English medicine, of a conspiracy of several tribes against Wessagusset and Plymouth. The threatening tribes, he was told, were led by the Massachusett but also included the Nauset, Paomet, Succonet, Mattachiest, Agowaywam, and Capawack tribes {{from as far away as}} Martha's Vineyard. In either case, Plymouth colony sent a small force under Miles Standish to Wessagusset. They arrived there on March 26.|$|E
5|$|The {{affiliation}} of the Assemblies of God {{with the}} National Association of Evangelicals in 1942 signaled the AG's alignment with evangelicalism and {{its opposition to}} mainline Protestantism and the ecumenical movement. The AG and its evangelical partners agreed on most issues and shared similar world views though the AG's Pentecostal distinctives—Spirit baptism and the operation of spiritual gifts—were not embraced by most evangelical Christians. The AG's response then to the charismatic movement {{that began in the}} 1960s was a cautious one, affirming the move of the Holy Spirit yet urging that all revival must be judged by scripture. For the first time, beliefs and practices which had largely remained confined to the classical Pentecostal denominations began to impact mainline Protestant and Roman Catholic churches on a large scale. The fact that this occurred in these churches (which were historically seen by Pentecostals as suspect), the multifaceted nature of the movement owing to the many different traditions its participants came from, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> by Pentecostals that the movement was based too much on experience and not on biblical teaching led some in the Assemblies of God to see it in relation to the ecumenical movement.|$|E
