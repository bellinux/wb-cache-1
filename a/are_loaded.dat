5|$|The Calais migrant crisis led to {{escalating}} {{tension between}} the UK and France {{in the summer of}} 2015. The UK blamed France for not doing enough to stop migrants from entering the tunnel or making attempts to scale fences built along the border. The British Prime Minister David Cameron released a statement saying that illegal immigrants would be removed from the UK even if they reached the island. To discourage migrants and refugees from jumping on train shuttles at Calais, the UK government supplied fencing to be installed in the Eurotunnel where the vehicles <b>are</b> <b>loaded</b> onto train shuttles in Calais.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} two platforms, one for {{unloading}} {{and one for}} loading. Two trains <b>are</b> <b>loaded</b> and unloaded while the third train is running the course. There is also a separate line in the station where riders can wait for the first seat. The loading platform has red overhead lights, which are located above the train. Millennium Force's theme song is played in the station while riders are boarding.|$|E
5|$|When one inhales or exhales, {{according}} to verses 4.47–65, the Nadis <b>are</b> <b>loaded</b> with vital airs. There are ten types of vital airs, corresponding to {{different stages of}} breathing, and they are named Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana, Naga, Kurma, Krikara, Devadatta and Dhananjaya. These affect the Nadis in different ways, and how the body functions and what the balance of organs within the body is, depends on food one takes in and how well inhalation and exhalation are able to deliver the vital airs to various body parts.|$|E

50|$|It should {{eventually}} {{be possible for}} any ITSO product to <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> onto any ITSO card.

South West Trains ticket vending machines allow tickets to <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> onto most ITSO cards.|$|R
5|$|On Halloween, when Homer {{collects}} {{supplies to}} protect his family and home from the marauding zombies, he decides to pursue a black sports car—which is a probe for the aliens' ship—to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. There, he finds Professor Frink, who has discovered the aliens' weakness: nuclear waste. He {{plans to use the}} alien ship's tractor beam to suck up cars that <b>are</b> <b>loaded</b> with barrels of nuclear waste. After successfully loading Frink's car, along with three more, into the aliens' tractor beam, the ship explodes. The following day, Springfield is returned to normal, and Homer is seen as a celebrity among the alien viewers of Foolish Earthlings.|$|E
5|$|When a USB {{device is}} first {{connected}} to a USB host, the USB device enumeration process is started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device. The data rate of the USB device is determined during the reset signaling. After reset, the USB device's information is read by the host and the device is assigned a unique 7-bit address. If the device {{is supported by the}} host, the device drivers needed for communicating with the device <b>are</b> <b>loaded</b> and the device is set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.|$|E
5|$|At Union Station, {{the cars}} <b>are</b> <b>loaded</b> onto a train {{car with the}} help of Wrench. Steve arrives shortly {{thereafter}} and after bribing Wrench, is surprised to find Charlie and the others waiting for him. Steve brandishes a gun and demands his gold back, but Mashkov arrives; Charlie explains that he has offered Mashkov part of the gold and Steve in exchange for helping with security protection. Steve is punched in the face by Stella before being taken away by Mashkov, who reveals he will be tortured and killed. The group boards the train as it departs to New Orleans, and celebrate in John's honor. The epilogue shows them all having used their share of the gold for their own desired purposes; Handsome Rob purchases an Aston Martin Vanquish, Left Ear buys a mansion in southern Spain, while Napster buys a powerful stereo capable of blowing a woman's clothes off. Meanwhile, Charlie takes John's advice about finding someone he wants {{to spend the rest of}} his life with, and he and Stella travel to Venice together.|$|E
