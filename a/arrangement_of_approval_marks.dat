5000|$|The {{dismissal}} of General Douglas MacArthur ignited {{a firestorm of}} outrage against Truman and support for MacArthur. Fierce criticism from virtually all quarters accused Truman of refusing to shoulder the blame for a war gone sour and blaming his generals instead. Others, including Eleanor Roosevelt, supported and applauded Truman's decision. MacArthur meanwhile returned to the U.S. to a hero's welcome, and addressed {{a joint session of}} Congress. In part due to the dismissal <b>of</b> MacArthur, Truman's <b>approval</b> <b>mark</b> in February 1952 stood at 22% according to Gallup polls, which was, until George W. Bush in 2008, the all-time lowest <b>approval</b> <b>mark</b> for an active American president.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, a {{piece of}} {{property}} became available at 1025 Bunn Drive in the northeast section of Princeton, with zoning appropriate for a church. After a lengthy process <b>of</b> <b>approvals,</b> <b>marked</b> by some vocal opposition, the congregation gained the requisite permissions to build and relocate. A new LEED certified facility of nearly 50,000 square feet was opened in December 2013. The church granted a permanent conservation easement over the wetlands on the southern third of the site, allowing for trail access to the Herrontown Woods Arboretum from Bunn Drive. With the departure from Westerly Road, a name change was deemed appropriate, and the church elders unanimously agreed upon Stone Hill Church of Princeton. The Stone Hill is {{a reference to the}} Rocky Hill Ridge on which the new building is located and the significant amount of stone that needed to be removed to allow for the foundation. [...] The original building was demolished to allow for subdivision into residential lots in accordance with the zoning. The new fellowship hall was named in honor of the Harris family, the three siblings who founded the church and donated the original land. The new prayer chapel was named in honor of Westerly and became home to the previous building's communion table and cross.|$|R

5000|$|The {{antisense}} field {{anticipated that}} the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> fomivirsen <b>marked</b> {{the beginning of a}} new age of antisense drug treatments, that would be similar to the uptake of monoclonal antibody therapy, but the next FDA <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> an antisense drug came in 2013. [...] Part of what held up Isis and other companies in the field, was the way that the oligomers were chemically treated to make them into drugs which prevented some hydrolysis but also reduced affinity to the antisense molecules' targets; around 2004 the field was shifting to second generation modifications. [...] Clinical trials of antisense therapeutics by Isis and others in the early 2000s were also plagued by lack of efficacy and immune reactions to drug candidates. Isis had to cut its workforce by 40% in 2005 due to weak sales of fomivirsen and lack of confidence by the market in antisense technology.|$|R

40|$|Decisions {{to adopt}} medical devices at the {{hospital}} level have consequences for health technology assessment (HTA) on system level and are therefore important to decision makers. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} characteristics of organizations and individuals that are more inclined to adopt and utilize cardiovascular devices based on a comprehensive analysis of environmental, organizational, individual, and technological factors and to identify corresponding implications for HTA. Seven random intercept hurdle models were estimated using the data obtained from 1249 surveys completed by members of the European Society of Cardiology. The major findings were that better manufacturer support increased the adoption probability of ‘new’ devices (i. e. in terms <b>of</b> CE <b>mark</b> <b>approval</b> dates), and that budget pressure increased the adoption probability of ‘old’ devices. Based on our findings, we suggest investigating the role of manufacturer support in more detail to identify diffusion patterns relevant to HTA on system level, to verify whether it functions as a substitute for medical evidence of new devices, and to receive new insights about its relationship with clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. © 2017 The Authors.

Congestion contributed to a decline of the on-time performance of buses, which was 92% percent in 2012 and 85% percent in the first quarter of 2014. Thomas Duane, representing New York's 29th Senate District which includes the area around the PABT, has also called for reduced congestion in the neighborhood. A consortium of regional transportation advocates, the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, have proposed a reconfiguration and expansion of the terminal, a PM west bound XBL, bus stops at other Manhattan locations, and a new bus storage depot. A proposed bus garage in Midtown, so that day-time turnover buses could avoid unnecessarily traveling through the tunnel without passengers, was scrapped by the agency in October 2011. In May 2012, the commissioner of NJDOT suggested that some NJ Transit routes could originate/terminate at other Manhattan locations, notably the East Side; an <b>arrangement</b> requiring <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> the NYC Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) to use bus stops.|$|R
