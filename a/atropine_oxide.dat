40|$|Acute organophosphorous {{pesticide}} (OP) poisoning kills a lot {{of people}} each year. Treatment of acute OP poisoning is of very difficult task and is a time taking event. Present day informatics methods (telemedicine), bioinformatics methods (data mining, molecular modeling, docking, cheminformatics), and nanotechnology (nanomedicine) should be applied in combination or separately to combat the rise of death rate due to OP poisoning. Use of informatics method such as Java enabled camera mobiles will enable us early detection of insecticidal poisoning. Even the patients who are severely intoxicated (suicidal attempts) can be diagnosed early. Telemedicine can take care for early diagnosis and early treatment. Simultaneously efforts must be taken with regard to nanotechnology to find lesser toxic compounds (use less dose of nanoparticle mediated compounds: nano-malathion) as insecticides and find better efficacy of lesser dose of compounds for treatment (nano-atropine) of OP poisoning. Nano-apitropine (<b>atropine</b> <b>oxide)</b> may be a better choice for OP poisoning treatment as the anticholinergic agent; apitropine and hyoscyamine have exhibited higher binding affinity than atropine sulfate. Synthesis of insecticides (malathion) with an antidote (atropine, apitropine) in nanoscale range will prevent the lethal effect of insecticides...|$|E
40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{inhibitory}} nonadrenergic, noncholinergic (NANC) neurotransmitter was studied in the canine ileocolonic junction. In a first series of experiments, circular muscle strips were mounted in organ baths filled with aerated Krebs-Ringer solution for isometric tension recording. During a norepinephrine-induced contraction and {{in the presence of}} <b>atropine,</b> nitric <b>oxide</b> (NO) induced tetrodotoxin-resistant relaxations that were similar to the NANC relaxations obtained by electrical stimulation and acetylcholine (ACh). Inhibition of the NO biosynthesis by N(G) -monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) and N(G) -nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) resulted in an increase in basal tension and inhibited the relaxations to electrical stimulation and ACh, but not those to NO. These effects were partly reversed by L-arginine, but not by D-arginine. Hemoglobin also raised the basal tension and reduced the relaxations to electrical stimulation and ACh and abolished those to NO. In a second series of experiments, we demonstrated the release of a labile factor with vasodilator activity upon stimulation of NANC nerves of the canine ileocolonic junction using a superfusion bioassay cascade. The release of this factor was inhibited by tetrodotoxin and L-NNA, whereas it was increased by L-arginine. The biological activity was enhanced by superoxide dismutase and eliminated by hemoglobin. Our results suggest that NO or an NO-releasing substance represents the NANC neurotransmitter in the canine ileocolonic junction. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} nitric oxide and {{acetylcholine}} (ACh) were investigated on the electrical and mechanical properties of vascular smooth muscle {{cells of the}} canine mesenteric artery. Isolated tissues {{with or without the}} endothelium were contracted with prostaglandin F(2 α). Nitric oxide caused comparable concentration-dependent relaxations in rings with and without endothelium. ACh induced concentration-dependent relaxations only in arteries with endothelium. The relaxations to both nitric oxide and ACh were inhibited by methylene blue or oxyhemoglobin. Either in {{the presence or absence of}} prostaglandin F(2 α), ACh caused transient hyperpolarization of the cell membrane of the vascular smooth muscle. The ACh-induced transient hyperpolarization was not observed after mechanical removal of the endothelial cells or after treatment with <b>atropine.</b> Nitric <b>oxide</b> (≤ 8 x 10 - 6 M) did not alter membrane potential, in either the presence or absence of the endothelium. The excitatory junction potentials generated by perivascular nerve stimulation were inhibited by ACh but not by nitric oxide. These results suggest that in the canine mesenteric artery 1) the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor generated by ACh is not nitric oxide; 2) nitric oxide relaxes vascular smooth muscle by a direct effect; and 3) nitric oxide does not modify adrenergic neurotransmission. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the role}} of {{dopamine}} in the bowel motility {{is far from being}} clear, our aim was to analyse pharmacologically the effects of dopamine on mouse ileum contractility. Contractile activity of mouse ileum was examined in vitro as changes in isometric tension. Dopamine caused a concentration-dependent reduction of the spontaneous contraction amplitude of ileal muscle up to their complete disappearance. SCH- 23390, D 1 receptor antagonist, which per se increased basal tone and amplitude of spontaneous contractions, antagonized the responses to dopamine, whilst sulpiride or domperidone, D 2 receptor antagonists, were without effects. The application of both D 1 and D 2 antagonists had additive effects. SKF- 38393, D 1 receptor agonist, mimicked dopamine-induced effects. Dopamine responses were insensitive to tetrodotoxin, <b>atropine,</b> nitric <b>oxide</b> synthase inhibitor or adenosine receptor antagonists, but they were reduced by adenylyl cyclase inhibition or apamin. Dopamine at a concentration which did not cause a significant reduction of phasic contractions inhibited the cholinergic contractions in response to field stimulation. SCH- 23390 per se induced an increase of the neural cholinergic contraction and antagonized the dopamine effects, whilst sulpiride or domperidone did not. The application of D 1 and D 2 antagonists had additive effects. In conclusion, mouse ileum is under basal inhibitory control by dopamine, through D 1 receptor activation, linked to adenylyl cyclase and activation of apamin-sensitive potassium channels. An agonistic interaction of the dopamine receptor subtypes in the regulation intestinal contractility has being also highlighted. This study would provide new insight on the pharmacology of the modulation of the gastrointestinal contractility by dopamine...|$|R
40|$|Aims We {{investigated}} the effects induced by exogenous adenosine on the spontaneous contractile {{activity of the}} longitudinal muscle of a mouse ileum, the receptor subtypes activated, the involvement of enteric nerves and whether opening of K+ channels was a downstream event leading to the observed effects. Main methods Mechanical responses of the mouse ileal longitudinal muscle to adenosine were examined in vitro as changes in isometric tension. Key findings Adenosine caused a concentration-dependent reduction of the spontaneous contraction amplitude of the ileal longitudinal muscle up to its complete disappearance. This effect induced was markedly reduced by an A 1 receptor antagonist, but not by A 2 and A 3 receptor antagonists and mimicked only by the A 1 receptor agonist. Adenosine uptake inhibitors did not change adenosine potency. A 1 receptor expression was detected at the smooth muscle level. Adenosine responses were insensitive to tetrodotoxin, <b>atropine</b> or nitric <b>oxide</b> synthase inhibitor. Tetraethylammonium and iberiotoxin, BKCa channel blockers, significantly reduced adenosine effects, whilst 4 -aminopyridine, a Kv blocker, apamin, a small conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ (SKCa) channel blocker, charybdotoxin, an intermediate conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ (IKCa) and BKCa channel blocker, or glibenclamide, an ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker, had no effects. The combination of apamin plus iberiotoxin caused a reduction of the purinergic effects greater than iberiotoxin alone. Significance Adenosine acts as an inhibitory modulator of the contractility of mouse ileal longitudinal muscle through postjunctional A 1 receptors, which in turn would induce opening of BKCa and SKCa potassium channels. This study would provide new insight in the pharmacology of purinergic receptors involved in the modulation of the gastrointestinal contractility...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} apply ion {{exchange}} paper chromatography to forensic chemistry, quaternary ammonium bases and related compounds, {{in the form}} of reineckates, were examined whether they were chromatographically detected with ion exchange paper. The ion exchange paper, amberlite SA- 2 was used. A dimethyl sulfoxide solution of the reineckate was spotted at the starting point that was at a 4 cm distance from the bottom edge of the ion exchange paper strip. The strip was hung in a chamber at 30 ℃, the bottom edge of strip was immersed in lM-Na 2 HPO 4 -NaOH buffer solution (pH 13. 30), and the ascending development was applied. After the run was completed, the strip was dried and passed through a freshly prepared solution of 2 % phosphomolybdic acid in lM hydrochloric acid. The presence of the bases was evidenced by the appearance of the yellow spot. Under such a condition, Rf values of the bases were as follows: 0. 44 for choline, 0. 20 for neurine, 0. 18 for tetraethylammonium, 0. 79 for betaine alde- hyde, 0. 74 for creatinine, and 0. 39 for antipyrine. It was impossible to detect betaine, <b>atropine,</b> and trimethylamine <b>oxide</b> by the above method. Irradiation of light on a dimethyl sulfoxide solution of choline remeckate had effect on the rate of release of choline from choline reineckate. Also, other careful investigation of the release showed that the release was caused by amberlite SA- 2 during the run. Beside, this method was applied to the detection of choline in the plants. 有機塩基のライネッケートを試料とするイオン交換ぺ一パークロマトグラフィーを試み，次の結果を得た。(1) イオン交換紙としてアンバーライトSA－ 2 を，展開液として 1 M－Na 2 HPO 4 －NaOH：緩衝液（pH 15 ． 50 ）を用いて，有機塩基のラィネッケートからもとの有機塩基を遊離再生せしめるための特別の操作を行なうことなく，有機塩基の分離，検出および定量を迅速かつ簡単に行なうことができた。(2) 有機塩基の遊離再生に関与する因子は光エネルギーおよびアンバーライトSA－ 2 であった。(3) 本法をアキのノゲシおよびオニタビラコに適用し，それぞれコリンを迅速かつ簡単に検出することができた...|$|R
