5|$|The frogs {{may move}} up to 100m during amplexus before the female lays her eggs. During the laying of the eggs, the pair of frogs remain in amplexus and the male is assumed to {{fertilise}} the eggs with his sperm. Males are also seen to paddle their rear legs during this time, which is speculated to accelerate fertilisation. The egg-laying and fertilisation process takes around five minutes. An average of 5,000 eggs are deposited amongst aquatic vegetation in a gelatinous mass; however, a clump of 11,682 has been recorded. The female moves around while depositing, {{leaving a trail of}} eggs that sometimes entangles upon itself. Initially, the mass floats, but sinks up to 12 hours after laying, or when disturbed. The eggs are distinct from those of other frog species; they are 2–2.5mm wide upon deposition and are bicoloured, black at one end and white at the other. They immediately begin to expand, quickly reaching around 4mm across, before sinking. When first laid, they float with the black pointing up, but after sinking, the orientation becomes disordered. Two to five days later, the tadpoles hatch out, but the process can take only a few hours on occasions. The hatching rate varies between 46 and 77%, and peaks at 22°C. Hatching is less likely in <b>acidic</b> <b>waters,</b> although alkaline conditions do not lead to a lower rate compared to neutral conditions. Given the large number of eggs that hatch per female and given the scarcity of mature frogs, tadpole survival rates are believed to be very low.|$|E

500|$|Dragonflies {{as a group}} {{occupy a}} {{considerable}} variety of habitats, but many species, and some families, have their own specific environmental requirements. Some species prefer flowing waters, while others prefer standing water. For example, the Gomphidae (clubtails) live in running water, and the Libellulidae (skimmers) live in still water. Some species are found in temporary water pools and are capable of tolerating changes in water level, desiccation, and the resulting variations in temperature, but some genera such as Sympetrum (darters) [...] have eggs and larvae that can resist drought and are stimulated to grow rapidly in warm, shallow pools, also often benefiting from the absence of predators there. Vegetation and its characteristics including submerged, floating, emergent, or waterside are also important. Adults may require emergent or waterside plants to use as perches; others may need specific submerged or floating plants on which to lay eggs. Requirements may be highly specific, as in Aeshna viridis (green hawker), which lives in swamps with the water-soldier, Stratiotes aloides. The chemistry of the water, including its trophic status (degree of enrichment with nutrients) and pH can also affect its use by dragonflies. Most species need moderate conditions, not too eutrophic, not too acid; a few species such as Sympetrum danae (black darter) and Libellula quadrimaculata (four-spotted chaser) prefer <b>acidic</b> <b>waters</b> such as peat bogs, while others such as Libellula fulva (scarce chaser) need slow-moving, eutrophic waters with reeds or similar waterside plants.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, the acidic {{discharges}} {{from active}} or abandoned mines were called acid mine drainage, or AMD. The term acid rock drainage, or ARD, {{was introduced in}} the 1980s and 1990s to indicate that acidic drainage can originate from sources other than mines. For example, a paper presented in 1991 at a major international conference on this subject was titled: [...] "The Prediction of Acid Rock Drainage - Lessons from the Database" [...] Both AMD and ARD refer to low pH or <b>acidic</b> <b>waters</b> caused by the oxidation of sulfide minerals, though ARD is the more generic name.|$|E
2500|$|Pure {{water has}} a pH close to 7 (neither {{alkaline}} nor acidic). Sea water can have [...] pH values {{that range from}} 7.5 to 8.4 (moderately alkaline). Fresh water can have widely ranging pH values depending on the geology of the drainage basin or aquifer {{and the influence of}} contaminant inputs (acid rain). If the water is acidic (lower than 7), lime, soda ash, or sodium hydroxide can be added to raise the pH during water purification processes. Lime addition increases the calcium ion concentration, thus raising the water hardness. For highly <b>acidic</b> <b>waters,</b> forced draft degasifiers can be an effective way to raise the pH, by stripping dissolved carbon dioxide from the water. Making the water alkaline helps coagulation and flocculation processes work effectively and also helps to minimize the risk of lead being dissolved from lead pipes and from lead solder in pipe fittings. [...] Sufficient alkalinity also reduces the corrosiveness of water to iron pipes. Acid (carbonic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid) may be added to alkaline waters in some circumstances to lower the pH. Alkaline water (above pH 7.0) {{does not necessarily mean that}} lead or copper from the plumbing system will not be dissolved into the water. [...] The ability of water to precipitate calcium carbonate to protect metal surfaces and reduce the likelihood of toxic metals being dissolved in water is a function of pH, mineral content, temperature, alkalinity and calcium concentration.|$|E
30|$|<b>Acidic</b> <b>water</b> and Al {{interferes with}} the ionbalance of fish by {{increasing}} ion efflux and by inhibiting the uptake of essential ions from the environment. <b>Acidic</b> <b>water</b> and Al also Ca use internal hypoxia which is seen, for example, as increased ventilation rate and may result from the precipitation or polymerization of Al onto the gills. Increased mucus secretion, and thickening or more striking changes in the bronchial epithelium may also occur. Innewly-hatched fry the gas exchange is mainly cutaneous and the skin evidently functions in ion-exchange also. Aluminum in <b>acidic</b> <b>water</b> clearly augments both the decrease of activity and retardation of yolk absorption and consequently the development and growth of yolk-sac fry, seen especially in species with a large yolk-sac and a long yolk-sac phase (Keinanen et al., 2000).|$|R
