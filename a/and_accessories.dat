5|$|Aesthetically glam metal draws {{heavily on}} the glam rock or glitter rock of the 1970s, often with very long backcombed hair, use of make-up, gaudy {{clothing}} <b>and</b> <b>accessories</b> (chiefly consisting of tight denim or leather jeans, spandex, and headbands). The visual aspects of glam metal appealed to music television producers, particularly MTV, whose establishment coincided {{with the rise of}} the genre. Glam metal performers became infamous for their debauched lifestyles of drugs, strippers and late-night parties, which were widely covered in the tabloid press.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to battling on foot, mecha specific to a character can be summoned. While each mech has a fixed main pilot, the sub-pilot can be changed, which alters {{the types of}} attacks the mech can perform. After defeating the enemy, the party receives experience points which raise their basic statistics, and skill points which are used to upgrade each character's skill tree, unlocking new skills. New items <b>and</b> <b>accessories</b> can only be gathered either through searching the environment or defeating enemies, as currency and shops are not present.|$|E

40|$|Parallel to the {{olfactory}} system, most mammals {{possess an}} accessory olfactory or vomeronasal system. The olfactory and vomeronasal epithelia project {{to the main}} <b>and</b> <b>accessory</b> olfactory bulbs, which in turn project to adjacent areas of the telencephalon, respectively. New data indicate that projections arising from the main <b>and</b> <b>accessory</b> olfactory bulbs partially converge in the rostral telencephalon and are non-overlapping at caudal telencephalic levels. Therefore, the basal telencephalon should be reclassified in olfactory, vomeronasal and mixed areas. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that virtually all olfactory- and vomeronasal-recipient structures send reciprocal projections to the main <b>and</b> <b>accessory</b> olfactory bulbs, respectively. Further, non-chemosensory recipient structures also projects centrifugally to the olfactory bulbs. These feed-back projections appear to be essential modulating processing of chemosensory information. The present work aims at characterizing centrifugal projections to the main <b>and</b> <b>accessory</b> olfactory bulbs arising from olfactory, vomeronasal, mixed and non-chemosensory recipient telencephalic areas. This issue has been addressed by using tracer injections in the rat and mouse brain. Tracer injections were delivered into the main <b>and</b> <b>accessory</b> olfactory bulbs {{as well as in}} olfactory, vomeronasal, mixed and non-chemosensory recipient telencephalic structures. The results confirm that olfactory- and vomeronasal-recipient structures project to the main <b>and</b> <b>accessory</b> olfactory bulbs, respectively. Interestingly, olfactory (e. g., piriform cortex), vomeronasal (e. g., posteromedial cortical amygdala), mixed (e. g., the medial amygdala) and non-chemosensory-recipient (e. g., the nucleus of the diagonal band) structures project to the main <b>and</b> to the <b>accessory</b> olfactory bulbs thus providing the possibility of simultaneous modulation and interaction of both systems at different stages of chemosensory processing...|$|R

5|$|The Famicom {{version of}} Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei is a {{traditional}} role-playing video game in which the player takes control of a party composed of two humans {{and a number of}} demons. The party explores a large dungeon using a first-person perspective. The human characters use a variety of weapons and items, with the primary weapons being swords and guns. The items, which can range from healing items to different types of currency, are picked up from enemies or found in chests scattered through the dungeon. Weapons <b>and</b> <b>accessories</b> are purchased at different shops found within the dungeon. Progress is saved using a password system.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} often {{encouraged}} {{to take advantage of}} environmental light sources and placing, and to use other light-based weapons <b>and</b> <b>accessories,</b> such as flare guns, hand-held flares and flashbangs. Wake can use searchlights to take out massive waves of Taken. Streetlights and other light stands can provide a safe haven, which the Taken cannot enter, and will regenerate the character's health faster. Otherwise, health regenerates slowly with time, when not taking any damage. In certain sections of the game, it is possible to use a car to traverse between locations in Bright Falls. When in a car, the player can run down Taken on the road, or boost the vehicle's headlights to destroy them.|$|E
