40|$|The imaging <b>and</b> <b>graphic</b> art {{industry}} {{is one of}} the higher GDP (Gross Domestic Product) generating industries in the UK. Generally, the quality of imaging <b>and</b> <b>graphic</b> art products depends on the properties of the imaging fluids, which are, in turn, determined by the physico-chemical interactions within the fluid, the imaging system and the imaging substrate. Despite the fact that the imaging <b>and</b> <b>graphic</b> art industry has been in existence for over one hundred years, it has thus far been difficult to understand many fundamental aspects of the physico-chemical interactions involved with the imaging process. To some extent, this has hindered the development of high quality imaging fluids, especially for more challenging imaging <b>and</b> <b>graphic</b> art work.

40|$|The topicality of the {{investigated}} {{problem is}} stipulated {{by the social}} need for training competitive engineers {{with a high level}} of graphical literacy; especially geometric <b>and</b> <b>graphic</b> training of students and its projected results in a competence-based approach; individual characteristics and interests of the students, as well as methodological approaches to the design of training and methodological support of the process of individualization of geometric <b>and</b> <b>graphic</b> training. The purpose of the article is to develop a structural and functional model of organization of geometric <b>and</b> <b>graphic</b> training of students of a technical University and its approbation. The leading method of research of this problem is a pedagogical modeling, which allows to consider this issue as a process of developing students readiness to operate spatial objects in the study of geometric <b>and</b> <b>graphic</b> disciplines. The article presents the structural and functional organization model of geometric <b>and</b> <b>graphic</b> training of students in technical university, consisting of interrelated components: a target, theoretical and methodological, technological, diagnostic and effective; we developed an algorithm for the implementation of this model. The article can be useful for the organization of the geometric <b>and</b> <b>graphic</b> training in universities, with appropriate adaptation in educational institutions of secondary vocational education in specialized classes in secondary schools. © 2016 Poluyanov et al...|$|R

5|$|Contracting out to {{independent}} studios, Philips subsequently used the characters to create three {{games for the}} CD-i, with Nintendo taking no part in their development except to give input on {{the look of the}} characters based on the artwork from Nintendo's original two titles and that of their respective instruction booklets. Philips insisted that the development studios utilize all aspects of the CD-i's capabilities including FMV, high-resolution graphics, and CD-quality music. Because the system had not been designed as a dedicated video game console, there were several technical limitations, such as laggy controls (especially for the standard infrared controller), and numerous problems in streaming-audio, memory, disc access, <b>and</b> <b>graphics.</b>|$|E
