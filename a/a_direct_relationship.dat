For factors that are variable, the table notes if it has <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>relationship</b> or an inverse relationship.

5|$|The {{composition}} originated {{during a}} period marked by Harrison's devotion to a Hindu-aligned ascetic life and {{the height of his}} public association with the Hare Krishna movement, which included his donation of Bhaktivedanta Manor for use as an ISKCON temple. In his lyrics, Harrison sings of the falsehood of striving for wealth or power in the material world and advocates <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>relationship</b> with one's deity as a genuine life goal. In doing so, he belittles the role of political leaders, as well as his own status as a celebrated rock musician. The song's Krishna Conscious message was also reflected in Harrison's choice of artwork for the Material World album, specifically the reproduction of a painting from a Prabhupada-published edition of the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E

5|$|Males {{are known}} to be aggressive, with larger and older turtles being more dominant. Larger males rank higher on the social {{hierarchy}} often created by wood turtle colonies. In the wild, the submissive turtle is either forced to flee, or is bombarded with physical abuses, which include biting, shoving, and ramming. Larger and more dominant males will sometimes try to remove a subordinate male while he is mating with a female. The defender will, if he does not successfully fight for his position, lose the female to the larger male. Therefore, among males, there is <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>relationship</b> between copulation opportunities and social rank. However, the outcome of encounters between two turtles is more aggression-dependent than size-dependent. The wood turtle that is more protective of his or her area is the victor. Physical bouts between wood turtles (regardless of gender) increases marginally during the fall and spring (times of mating).|$|E
5|$|The urial (O. vignei) {{was once}} {{thought to have been}} a forebear of {{domestic}} sheep, as they occasionally interbreed with mouflon in the Iranian part of their range. However, the urial, argali (O. ammon), and snow sheep (O. nivicola) have a different number of chromosomes than other Ovis species, making <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>relationship</b> implausible, and phylogenetic studies show no evidence of urial ancestry. Further studies comparing European and Asian breeds of sheep showed significant genetic differences between the two. Two explanations for this phenomenon have been posited. The first explanation is that a currently unknown species or subspecies of wild sheep that contributed to the formation of domestic sheep. The second explanation is that this variation is the result of multiple waves of capture from wild mouflon, similar to the known development of other livestock.|$|E

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{ascertain}} how trait aggression relates to individuals' motives and tendencies to participate in various types of gossip; while empirically differentiating between the application of negative and positive gossip within organizations. Based on the association between both gossip and aggression with dominance and power, the current study proposed that individuals' tendency to gossip would {{be a function of}} trait aggression and their motive to gossip. In other words, aggressive individuals possess a strong desire to harm and gain power from others and they are likely to perceive gossip as a means to fulfill this need. Results (N = 353) indicated that there is a relationship between trait aggression and gossip. Specifically, the interaction between implicit and explicit aggression had <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> positive <b>relationship</b> with the tendency to gossip about others' achievements. Additionally, implicit aggression had <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> positive <b>relationship</b> with the motive to gossip for negative influence, information gathering/validation, and group protection as well as the tendency to gossip about social information and others' physical appearance. Moreover, explicit aggression had <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> positive <b>relationship</b> with both the motive to gossip for negative influence and the tendency to gossip about social information. Last, and most intriguing, only the motive to gossip for negative influence had <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> positive <b>relationship</b> with the tendency to gossip about social information, others' physical appearance, others' appearance, and sublimated gossip. Taken together, results imply that trait aggressive individuals gossip more than their non-aggressive counterparts and are motivated to do so {{in order to have a}} negative influence on others. M.

25|$|The {{accepted}} {{theory of}} {{heat in the}} 18th century viewed {{it as a kind}} of fluid, called caloric; although this theory was later shown to be erroneous, a number of scientists adhering to it nevertheless made important discoveries useful in developing the modern theory, including Joseph Black (1728â€“99) and Henry Cavendish (1731â€“1810). Opposed to this caloric theory, which had been developed mainly by the chemists, was the less accepted theory dating from Newton's time that heat is due to the motions of the particles of a substance. This mechanical theory gained support in 1798 from the cannon-boring experiments of Count Rumford (Benjamin Thompson), who found <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>relationship</b> between heat and mechanical energy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractUsing two {{different}} studies we assess {{under what conditions}} Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) affects consumer satisfaction. In the first study, based on the American Customer Satisfaction Index, and a content analysis of CSR initiatives reported by 65 US companies, findings show <b>a</b> positive <b>direct</b> <b>relationship</b> between CSR and customer satisfaction with CSR training and environmental initiatives, but <b>a</b> negative <b>direct</b> <b>relationship</b> between CSR corporate communication initiatives and customer satisfaction. The second study, through an empirical study based on an online survey of consumers, points to {{a positive relationship between}} CSR and customer satisfaction. Our findings suggest <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> and <b>an</b> indirect route for this relationship through brand attitudes. These apparently divergent, but complementary results, between the two studies are explained by the different conceptual approaches that underline the CSR communication processes and the relationship between consumers and brand.
