5|$|Renoir {{continued}} shooting additional {{scenes with}} some of the actors. The opening scene at the airfield was shot in mid-June at the Bourget Airport {{in the middle of the}} night with whatever extras they could find. Renoir had almost run out of money when he filmed the car crash scene, which was shot very quickly with Alain Renoir <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> operator. Renoir never liked the scene and initially removed it. The principal photography was nine and a half weeks over schedule when it was finally wrapped in June.|$|E

5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with Utada entering a warehouse, and lifts a tarp off a hover cycle. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> pans away from the bike, Utada sits down and starts the bike. The first verse opens with Utada singing to the camera in a warehouse, whilst intercut scenes have her driving throughout Shibuya, Japan. As the verse progresses, two more clones of Utada appear and sing behind the original Utada. As the chorus starts, the hover cycle starts grinding against the road as she rides through small streets and corners. During the second verse, Utada stops through a city centre as shots of the clones appear on city billboards. She takes of her goggles, {{and stares at the}} moon, while close-up of the clone's faces are seen singing to the track.|$|E
5|$|At Tabata's suggestion, Naora {{expanded}} the color palette {{to increase the}} game's realism and tie in with XVs art style. The original idea was to change the original red hue to a golden one to match the redone logo, but the graphics looked too dark on the large screen even with the adjustment, so blue tones were added to brighten up the scenery. Additional bass sounds {{were added to the}} sound effects, as the original platform's speaker system had previously limited the range and strength of sounds. The original camera behavior needed to be developed from scratch, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> angles used in the original looked out of place on the large screen. During the run-up to release, the team made modifications to the camera after receiving negative comments during demonstrations, addressing scenery collisions and the visibility of player and enemy characters during active gameplay. Because of these modifications, character speed and movement could be increased and improved. By December 2014, the game was in its final stages of development and undergoing debugging.|$|E
5|$|Before Crisis was {{the first}} {{original}} video game developed by Square Enix exclusively for mobile phones, originally released on NTT DoCoMo's FOMA mobile devices, and the first action role-playing game exclusive to the platform. The company's first major mobile title, also in collaboration with NTT DoCoMo, was a remake of the original Final Fantasy. Using {{lessons learned from the}} development of the Final Fantasy port, the team worked hard to make Before Crisis a uniquely mobile experience, with gameplay features built to exploit mobile functions such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> and network capacity. The camera function used to generate Materia was based on a simple image recognition that specifies the Materia generated based on the picture's general color. One of the challenges during development was to keep the framerate smooth during moments of high action, especially as no two mobiles would have identical components. In addition to these problems were issues with integrating the multiplayer functions, balancing the gameplay for different playstyles, creating a comfortable button layout, and adjusting the amount of content they could include for mobiles while maintaining the desired product quality.|$|E

Angela and Wallace head off to bed in one another's arms but <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> pans out the scene shifts to their skeletal remains {{in the same position}} {{in the middle of a}} field. FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigate and after closer examination of the bones, the two find a strange yellow substance covering the underside of the skeletons which was missed in the original examination.

5|$|The {{fourth and}} final entry in the Uncharted series, , was showcased at E3 2014, during Sony's press conference. A trailer {{features}} a wounded Drake washing ashore an island. He rises, grabs his gun, and checks its ammo before walking into a jungle-like area, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> pans to show hanging cages with skeletons inside. The trailer also features a conversation between Drake and Sully, where Drake asks for Sully's help, having seemingly just laid out a plan. Sully warns Nate against it, but Nate responds {{that he has no}} choice, and asks if he can count on Sully one last time, who confirms that he can. A Thief's End takes place three years after the events of Drake's Deception. Drake has retired from fortune hunting, and is seemingly still married to Elena, as he still wears his ring in the trailer, but is dragged back into the profession by his thought dead older brother, Sam Drake (voiced by Troy Baker), after the latter discovers a lead to the semi-mythical anarchist colony of Libertalia and with it, the possible location of the treasure stolen by the legendary pirate captain Henry Avery.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Gaga, {{dressed in black}} clothing, sunglasses, bloody feet, and {{seemingly}} bionic features, walking through a field in Nebraska; having returned on foot after years of absence. Gaga goes to buy ice cream from an ice cream truck, but she suddenly drops it as a toothless man with a doll in his hand grins at her. She begins to have flashbacks to an earlier time spent in Nebraska as scenes of Gaga having a wedding, being tortured by a man inside a barn, and being inside a water tank appear in quick succession. The song starts playing <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> zooms slowly towards Gaga, who is standing bent forward as she begins singing. The video continually switches to scenes where Gaga, with little make up, a simple gray-colored hair style, and a white dress, plays a piano {{in the middle of}} a cornfield, while her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, sits on top of the piano, smoking and drinking a beer. As Calderone pulls up his sleeves, present day Gaga is still walking through the desert.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} scene in which Eminem stands on the rooftop of the Manhattan Municipal Building in New York, saying the {{introductory}} lyrics. The video cuts between scenes where he raps on the rooftop and another scene where Eminem is trapped inside a dark basement. Eminem moves closer towards the edge of the building until he leaves to go downstairs as the chorus begins. He starts walking down Market Street in Newark and jaywalks across the street, avoiding vehicles that pass by. Eminem sees distorted reflections of himself on the window of a car; he continues on, only to be surrounded by a series of mirrors. Confused, Eminem tries to escape, and {{towards the end of the}} second chorus, he breaks through a mirror to find himself in the middle of the street. Interspersing scenes show Eminem as he tries to break out of the basement. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> zooms out, the viewers see him on the edge of a destroyed street while a subway tunnel can be seen below the road.|$|E
5|$|The series' title {{sequence}} {{was created}} by production studio Elastic for HBO. Creative director Angus Wall and his collaborators received the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Main Title Design for the sequence, which depicts a three-dimensional map of the series' fictional world. The map is projected {{on the inside of}} a sphere which is centrally lit by a small sun in an armillary sphere. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> moves across the map, focusing on the locations of the episode's events, clockwork mechanisms intertwine and allow buildings and other structures to emerge from the map. Accompanied by the title music, the names of the principal cast and creative staff appear. The sequence concludes after about 90 seconds with the title card and brief opening credits indicating the episode's writer(s) and director. Its composition changes as the story progresses, with new locations replacing those featuring less prominently or not at all.|$|E

She dances erotically around a pole and up against a mirror. Throughout the video, she continues to dance and flip her hair while special effects lights flash around her <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> moves slightly in and out of focus to the beat of the song. The video's light systems change from black and white with aura-like blue and pink hues to full blown color. Around the middle of the video, she is joined by two alter egos of her female friends, who also dance around the pole. The blonde Spears and her friends, while watching the dancing, later draw their attention to an attractive man sitting with his friends at a table across the bar.|$|E

As she sticks it on her wall, she begins a quest to lose weight for {{the man in the}} photo, and starts running and exercising in Los Angeles, California. Throughout the entire video, it has the woman running to different locations and trying different workouts with the public, whilst small animations of her exercising are added into small parts. Near the end of the video, the girl decides to get a makeover, whilst a stylist dresses her in a pink dress. She runs towards the man in a park, though he is disinterested and walks away. A man holding a balloon bumps into the woman, and <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> pans away to the balloons floating towards the sky, the woman turns into Hamasaki.

5|$|Type-0 had {{a highly}} {{positive}} reception in Japan, with it garnering near-perfect scores in Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation. Import reviews were also fairly positive, sharing many points of praise with the Japanese reviews.

Other aspects came in for criticism, such as elements of the graphics upgrade, the real-time strategy segments, and the localization. Western previews of Agito have also been positive, with critics agreeing that it looked good on the platform and worked well from a gameplay standpoint. Final Fantasy XV was positively received by many journalists; praise went to aspects of the story, the main characters, battle system and graphics, while the overarching plot, supporting cast and other technical elements such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> and late-game changes in gameplay were criticized.|$|E
5|$|While {{the video}} was filmed {{as a single}} shot on at least three {{different}} occasions, they planned on using post-editing to slow down or speed up {{certain parts of the}} take to keep it in time with the final soundtrack. There is a noted cut in the video, in which the camera passes through a set of curtains on the transition to the downstairs portion of the machine; according to one of the machine designers, Hector Alvarez, this cut was introduced by the band, speculating it was introduced to avoid a shot of one of the band members or cameraman in frame or otherwise to keep the machine video synchronized to the machine. Both Tim Nordwind, bassist for the band, and Adam Sadowsky, president of Syyn Labs, said that while the machine worked in its entirety 3 times, and no cut was needed, the decision was made so a better result on the downstairs portion could be included in the final version. There was also a second cut which can be noticed by watching a piano against a wall <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> passed behind some rods; the piano can be seen apparently warping in shape and position.|$|E
