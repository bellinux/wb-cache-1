30|$|In these mining systems, a {{continuous}} miner or an <b>auger</b> <b>machine</b> is primarily used to extract coal from the highwalls. Recently other {{systems such as}} Bucyrus Highwall Miners (formerly Superior Highwall Miners) and American Highwall Systems have been introduced in the US (The Virginia Center for Coal and Energy Research 2008).|$|E
30|$|Highwall mining {{systems have}} {{improved}} mining operations {{due to their}} safety and productivity. However, the application is restricted by coal seam conditions such as the dip, thickness, roll, split of the seam, the existence of faulting and folding, etc. It is difficult or almost impossible to apply the system into steeper dipping coal seams, over 15 °. Therefore, another type of system was developed, aimed at coal seams in the 16 °– 25 ° dip range. A high-powered <b>auger</b> <b>machine,</b> for use in seam dips of up to 23 °, was developed and introduced at a coal mine in Australia (Matsui et al. 2003).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{computer}} {{hardware and software}} integrated to provide computer-assisted control and monitoring of four different coal mining machines. The backbone of each system is a U. S. Bureau of Mines integrated distributed microcomputer control network called BOM/NET. The network provides connections for intelligent sensors and systems that provide for navigation, diagnostics, and computer control. Many different computer systems using various operating systems (including RMX I, UNIX, VXWORKS, DOS and DCX 51) have been connected to the network and each have had complete network functionality. A description of the network's integration to Joy' 16 CM, a Joy 14 CM, a Jeffrey 102, continuous mining machines, and a custom built <b>auger</b> <b>machine</b> is provided. The networks for the Joy 16 CM, the Joy 14 CM, and the Jeffrey 102 have been installed and extensively tested at the Bureau's surface test facility. The Jeffrey 102 system has also been tested in a highwall coal seam. The Joy 14 CM will soon be tested underground...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{raise the}} cutting {{efficiency}} {{and percentage of}} lumps for the <b>auger</b> mining <b>machine,</b> two cutting models (the axial cutting and the radial cutting) were proposed according to the mining technique of the <b>auger</b> mining <b>machine.</b> Picks installed on different positions of the operating mechanism were optimized. The operating mechanism was developed according to the optimized result. For comparison, trials were carried out with the existing operating mechanism of the same model of <b>auger</b> mining <b>machine.</b> The {{results indicate that the}} production efficiency and the advance speed of the new operating mechanism are increased, and the axial resistance is reduced in the same conditions as the existing operating mechanism. And the drilled hole is flatness, there are no obvious cross-sections {{on the wall of the}} hole, which indicates that the stability of the new operating mechanism is good, and taking full advantage of coal collapsing during cutting with picks. Simultaneously, the percentage of lumps of the new operating mechanism is increased, while wear on the picks is uniform...|$|R
40|$|Powder filled sachets {{containing}} a 3 : 1 (w/w) powder mixture of diacetylmorphine base and caffeine anhydrate were {{developed as a}} dosage form for smokable heroin used {{for the treatment of}} chronic, treatment-resistant heroin addicts. The powder mixture was filled into sachets using a micro dose <b>auger</b> filler <b>machine.</b> The goal {{of this study was to}} identify the most important process variables that influence precision of dosing. Five variables were tested: auger speed, agitator speed, hopper fill level, dose interval, and dose. An experimental design was used to study the effects of each of these variables, including possible non-linear and interaction effects. A 9 -term regression model was constructed, explaining 94 % of the observed variation in dose weight variation coefficient. Dose, agitator speed and hopper fill level were the most important variables. The regression model was used to identify optimal settings of the variables for four sachet doses intended for routine manufacture. The results of four test batches manufactured with these optimised settings showed that accurate (accuracy: 99. 0 - 101. 0 %) and precise (CV: 3. 2 - 5. 3 %) filling of diacetylmorphine/caffeine sachets is possible using the micro dose <b>auger</b> filler <b>machine.</b> (C) 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the entire}} {{structure}} and operating {{principles of the}} toss feeding typed stalk baler are introduced. The baler is mainly consisted of collecting, feeding, compression and knotting component. A Y-shaped straw chopper blade {{is used in the}} collecting. A combination component of <b>auger</b> and toss <b>machine</b> is adopted in the feeding system. The sliding block of compressor is driven by rod-crank mechanism. Structure analysis shows that the toss feeding typed straw baling machine has advantages of simple structure, high efficiency and low manufacturing cost. At the same time, the structural analysis provides an important theoretical basis for further optimal design of baling machine...|$|R
5000|$|Deep cement mixing {{involves}} first extracting {{soil from}} the ground into which binder material is later to be injected. Typically this is done with an <b>auger</b> type <b>machine</b> in order to penetrate deeply but narrowly into the soil. Upon reaching the required depth, cement or sometimes another binder material is being injected into the excavated hole. As the soil is soft, the binder material mixes with the soil diffusing back into the excavated hole, so {{it is important to}} choose a binder material appropriate for the specific soil, although {{in the vast majority of}} cases, cement works well. As the cement-soil mix begins to harden, further cement is added on top of the growing column until the column reaches all the way up to the start. During this process further excavation of the diffusing soil may be required. Finally the machinery is moved to the location of the next column where the process is repeated in order to form another column. Once fully hardened these columns are then able to bear much higher loads than the seabed (when using the technique to reclaim land) or the typically soft soil upon which one wants to build.|$|R
40|$|A braconid parasitoid, Diachasmimorpha tryoni (Cameron), was {{released}} from the air into Guatemalan coVee plantations that contained Mediterranean fruit ¯ ies, Ceratitis capitata (Weidemann). Parasitoid adults were chilled, placed in paper bags, and dropped from an altitude of 100 m and at an airspeed of ~ 130 km /h. Releases were made at four diVerent densities over a period of two years. At the higher release rates parasitism levels reached as high as 84 %. The feasibility of using a more technically sophisticated aerial release technique, the <b>auger</b> sterile-insect release <b>machine</b> utilized in C. capitata sterile- ¯ y aerial eradication projects in California and Florida, was also examined. Chilled D. tryoni either alone or in combination with chilled, sterile C. capitata, were dropped over target areas and the released parasitoids examined for mortality and damage. Samples of released parasitoids were taken and tested for ` ¯ ight ability ’; i. e. ¯ ight response after an opportunity to recover from chilling. There was no evidence of signi ® cant mortality due to aerial release, and the ¯ ight-ability of insects released at various rates and altitudes did not signi ® cantly diVer from chilled controls that were not released from an airplane...|$|R
40|$|In July 2011, a 46 year-old male {{equipment}} operator (victim) {{working for}} a trenchless utility installation contractor suffered fatal crushing injuries when a horizontal <b>auger</b> boring (HAB) <b>machine</b> overturned. At {{the time of the}} incident, the victim was installing three steel pipe casings using a trenchless method called pipe ramming at a municipal water project site. Each casing was 36 in (0. 9 m) in diameter and 40 ft. (12 m) long. The casings were driven horizontally through the ground by a pneumatic ramming hammer. On the day of the incident, the victim was operating an HAB machine to bore inside the casings to remove earth material that filled the casings during installation. The machine was mounted on a track assembly and the track assembly was not anchored to the ground. The weight of the machine and the track assembly was 15, 800 lbs. (7, 167 kg). The victim was operating the machine at the operator’s platform located {{on the left side of}} the machine (when facing the casing). The incident occurred shortly after 10 : 00 am when the auger string had advanced approximately 11 ft. (3. 4 m) into the casing. The HAB machine along with the track assembly suddenly pitched to the left roughly 90 degrees counterclockwise (Photo 1). Unable to jump free, the victim was pinned by the machine against the ground before the machine swung back to the upright position. Immediately the machine pitched to the left a second time, crushing the victim, and swun...|$|R
