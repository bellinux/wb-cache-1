Widlar {{decided to move to}} a semiconductor manufacturing company, and in 1963 Jerry Sanders, a Fairchild Semiconductor salesman, provided him the opportunity. According to Thomas Lee, Fairchild also wanted to have Widlar on board, and breached professional ethics by recruiting a key employee of their customer. In September 1963 Widlar was invited for an interview with Fairchild research and development (R) manager Heinz Ruegg. Widlar arrived at the interview intoxicated, and frankly told Ruegg what he thought about Fairchild's analog circuits: [...] "What they are doing is bullshit". Widlar was sent to another interview with the company's <b>Applications</b> <b>Engineering</b> division, which was based in Mountain View, California. The division head, John Hulme, hired Widlar despite objections from the first round interviewers. Widlar's first assignment at Fairchild targeted IC reliability through adjustments in fabrication processes. This early work, directed by process engineer David Talbert, reduced the price of planar process and made possible development of monolithic (fully integrated) linear ICs. Widlar, who formally reported to John Barrett, proved himself capable of quickly improving Barrett's own designs and very soon squeezed his nominal boss out of the company.|$|E

50|$|His first {{assignment}} at SSC, known {{then as the}} Mississippi Test Facility, was as a test engineer {{working on}} the Saturn V S-II second stage test program, part of the Apollo Project. When the facility's manager, Jackson Balch, began diversifying the installation in the early 1970s, he assigned Estess to serve {{as one of his}} marketers. Balch tasked Estess with searching for new and compatible federal and state agencies to share in the vast facilities and diverse programs starting up at the center.Estess was then named head of the <b>Applications</b> <b>Engineering</b> Office that related to the new agencies and the public sector. He later served as deputy of the Earth Resources Laboratory (ERL). His organizational and management skills were further developed during his tenure as director of the Regional Applications Program (RAP). The RAP was an innovative approach to assist the 17 Sun Belt states in the application of remote sensing technology to resource planning and management. Estess was selected as the center's deputy director in 1980 when the facility was known as the National Space Technologies Laboratories (NSTL).|$|E
5000|$|In 1970, {{he joined}} Fairchild Semiconductor in San Francisco as an <b>applications</b> <b>engineering</b> {{consultant}} within their sales division. While there, {{he created the}} early arcade game Demolition Derby out of his garage. In the mid-1970s, Lawson was made Chief Hardware Engineer and director of engineering and marketing for Fairchild's video game division. There, he led {{the development of the}} Fairchild Channel F console, released in 1976 and specifically designed to use swappable game cartridges. At the time, most game systems had the game programming stored on ROM storage soldered onto the game hardware, which could not be removed. Lawson and his team figured out how to move the ROM to a cartridge that could be inserted and removed from a console unit repeatedly, and without electrically shocking the user. This would allow users to buy into a library of games, and provided a new revenue stream for the console manufacturers through sales of these games. Lawson's invention of the interchangeable cartridge was so novel and influential that every cartridge he produced had to be approved by the Federal Communications Commission. The Channel F was not a commercially successful product, but the cartridge approach was picked up by other console manufacturers, popularized with the Atari 2600 released in 1977.|$|E

In this research preview, we present our current and planned work regarding this problem.

40|$|Abstract—Large {{companies}} have large embedded software systems, where common and reusable software parts are dis-tributed in various interrelated subsystems that also {{have lots of}} uncommon and non-reusable parts. The approach finds software parts {{that may or may}} not be reusable in a particular <b>application</b> <b>engineering</b> project. It is the task of <b>application</b> <b>engineering</b> to figure out whether the identified components and variants are directly reusable and reuse them in <b>application</b> <b>engineering.</b> In Software Product Lines, the identified reusable common and variable components should be generalized and stored into asset bases. In real life, it may be too much effort and costs to generalize application level assets into domain assets and it is just more feasible to try to find reusable common and variable components directly from existing applications. The proposed approach is selectively targeting the component-feature model instead of an inclusive search to improve the identification. We explore the components and their features from a predefined component node list and the features node vector respectively...|$|R
