5|$|By {{the time}} Carl Meissner {{published}} his 1856 <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genus, there were 58 described Banksia species.

He listed six species and a further four varieties all now sunk into B.marginata in series Salicinae.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus helenae is {{distinguished}} from the more common C.striatus by its faint inner-surface plication (C.striatus has a more pronounced plication), the nodular <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hairs on the outer surface, and microscopically by the spore shape – ellipsoid in C.striatus, ovoid or spheroidal in C.helenae.|$|E
5|$|First {{collected}} in 1964, it was formally described in 2009.

Chalukyan temples were, almost always, built facing the east.|$|E

5|$|A virus particle, {{also known}} as a virion, {{consists}} of genes made from DNA or RNA which are surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a capsid. The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capsomers can either be icosahedral (20-sided), helical or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, which is formed by proteins. Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of lipid (fat) called an envelope.|$|E
5|$|After initial cutting, {{the diamond}} is shaped in {{numerous}} stages of polishing. Unlike cutting, {{which is a}} responsible but quick operation, polishing removes material by gradual erosion and is extremely time consuming. The associated technique is well developed; it is considered as a routine and can be performed by technicians. After polishing, the diamond is reexamined for possible flaws, either remaining or induced by the process. Those flaws are concealed through various diamond enhancement techniques, such as repolishing, crack filling, or clever <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stone in the jewelry. Remaining non-diamond inclusions are removed through laser drilling and filling of the voids produced.|$|E

5|$|Charles Martel was {{the first}} member of a group of five battleships built to a broadly similar design, but {{different}} enough to be considered unique vessels. Design specifications were identical for each of the ships, but different engineers designed each vessel. The ships were based on the previous battleship , but instead of mounting the main battery all on the centerline, the ships used the lozenge <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier vessel , which moved two of the main battery guns to single turrets on the wings. The five ships were built in response to the British s.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds occur {{most often}} as {{euhedral}} or rounded octahedra and twinned octahedra known as macles. As diamond's crystal structure has a cubic <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atoms, {{they have many}} facets that belong to a cube, octahedron, rhombicosidodecahedron, tetrakis hexahedron or disdyakis dodecahedron. The crystals can have rounded off and unexpressive edges and can be elongated. Diamonds (especially those with rounded crystal faces) are commonly found coated in nyf, an opaque gum-like skin.|$|E

5|$|Disadvantages {{resulting}} from the nature of orbital mechanics would make the <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbits of the swarm extremely complex. The simplest such arrangement is the Dyson ring, in which all such structures share the same orbit. More-complex patterns with more rings would intercept more of the star's output, but would result in some constructs eclipsing others periodically when their orbits overlap. Another potential {{problem is that the}} increasing loss of orbital stability when adding more elements increases the probability of orbital perturbations.|$|E
