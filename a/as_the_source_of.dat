30|$|It can be {{observed}} that both cyclic load and generator control equipment (GCE) were reported <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> forced oscillations. In addition, in the recent years, GCEs such as PSS and automatic voltage regulators (AVR) are reported more often <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> forced oscillations. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forced oscillations mainly are located on the generator sides. This prior information suggests that to detect and locate forced oscillations, one may want to place more attentions on the generation sides.|$|R

5|$|In {{a further}} step, some NAD is {{converted}} into NADP by NAD kinase, which phosphorylates NAD.

5|$|A 1996 E. Coli {{outbreak}} {{at one of}} Burger King's largest beef providers, Hudson Foods, gave Tyson Foods one of {{its largest}} business coups. Hudson {{was one of the}} largest poultry providers in the United States and one of Tyson's largest competitors when they moved into beef processing at the behest of Burger King. Once it had secured a contract with Burger King, Hudson opened a beef processing plant in Nebraska. When the plant was identified <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> an E.

5|$|According to Martin Špegelj, the Defence Minister of Croatia between August 1990 and July 1991, the Croatian Army was {{informed}} by a Yugoslav Air Force Željava Air Base-based source about a top secret mission {{prepared for the}} next day, but Špegelj claims that the information was not taken seriously {{due to lack of}} details. Other sources assert that a warning was conveyed by Croatian security and intelligence system services, indicating the Soviet Union and its then-president Mikhail Gorbachev <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the information.

5|$|Borobudur was {{considered}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> souvenirs, {{and parts of}} its sculptures were looted, some even with colonial-government consent. In 1896 King Chulalongkorn of Siam visited Java and requested and was allowed to take home eight cartloads of sculptures taken from Borobudur. These include thirty pieces taken {{from a number of}} relief panels, five buddha images, two lions, one gargoyle, several kala motifs from the stairs and gateways, and a guardian statue (dvarapala). Several of these artifacts, most notably the lions, dvarapala, kala, makara and giant waterspouts are now on display in the Java Art room in The National Museum in Bangkok.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{hypothesis}} was put forth that argued the impactor {{that killed the}} dinosaurs belonged to the Baptistina family of asteroids. Concerns have been raised regarding the reputed link, in part because very few solid observational constraints exist of the asteroid or family. Indeed, it was recently discovered that 298 Baptistina does not share the same chemical signature <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the K–Pg impact. Although this finding may make {{the link between the}} Baptistina family and K–Pg impactor more difficult to substantiate, it does not preclude the possibility. A 2011 Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, (WISE), study of reflected light from the asteroids of the family estimated the break-up at 80Ma, giving it insufficient time to shift orbits and impact the Earth by 66Ma.|$|E
5|$|In Arabic, {{the word}} for street (الشارع, ash-shāriʿ) is derived from a root whose other forms denote a place of entry or beginning, {{the point of a}} weapon, and law or {{lawfulness}} and legitimacy in both the secular and religious sense. Among those words are sharia, the term for Islamic religious and moral law. Shāriʿ itself {{can also be used to}} refer to a legislator or lawgiver, and when used with the definite article al- in a religious context is a reference to God <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> all religious law.|$|E

According to one account, two master planned communities were situated {{in the middle of the}} drainage and were thus deluged by the storm. The water department head took the blame for the construction, but also said that the disaster was a natural phenomenon.|$|E

He states that Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus and Plato all travelled abroad to learn magic, remarking that it was surprising anyone accepted the doctrines they brought back, and that medicine (of Hippocrates) and magic (of Democritus) should have flourished simultaneously {{at the time of}} the Peloponnesian War.|$|E

Whorf took a special interest in the Hopi language and started working with Ernest Naquayouma, a speaker of Hopi from Toreva village living in Manhattan, New York. Whorf credited Naquayouma <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> most of his information on the Hopi language, although in 1938 he took a short field trip to the village of Mishongnovi, on the Second Mesa of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{pigeons and doves}} are used as food; however, all types are edible. The {{powerful}} breast muscles characteristic of the family make excellent meat.

5|$|Spanish conquistadors brought {{potatoes}} and tomatoes from the Americas to Europe in the 16th century, but these vegetables only became commonly grown and consumed in Eastern Europe in the 19th century. Eventually, both became staples of peasant diet and essential ingredients of Ukrainian and Russian borscht. Potatoes replaced turnips in borscht recipes, and tomatoes – fresh, canned or paste – took over from beet sour <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> tartness. The turnip is rarely found in modern recipes, and even then, together with potatoes. In Ukraine, beet sour and tomatoes were both used {{for some time}} until the latter ultimately prevailed during {{the last third of}} the 19th century.|$|E
