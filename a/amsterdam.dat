5|$|Around 1657, Ruisdael {{moved to}} <b>Amsterdam,</b> by then a prosperous city which {{was likely to}} have offered a bigger market for his work. His fellow Haarlem painter Allaert van Everdingen had already moved to <b>Amsterdam</b> and found a market there. On June 17, 1657 he was baptized in Ankeveen, near Naarden. Ruisdael {{lived and worked in}} <b>Amsterdam</b> {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1668, his name appears as a witness to the {{marriage}} of Meindert Hobbema, his only registered pupil, a painter whose works have been confused with Ruisdael's own.|$|E

5|$|Stokvis {{was born}} to Rachel Wittering and Joseph Barend Stokvis, Jr., a Jewish {{physician}} and obstetrician in <b>Amsterdam.</b> He studied medicine in <b>Amsterdam</b> and at the University of Utrecht under Franciscus Donders and Jacobus Schroeder van der Kolk, obtaining a doctorate on a dissertation on hepatic glucose production in diabetes in 1856. His thesis appeared shortly {{after the publication of}} related work by the French physiologist Claude Bernard. Stokvis may also have been influenced by the chemist Gerardus Mulder in <b>Amsterdam.</b> Subsequently, he travelled to Paris and Vienna (and possibly Prague), before establishing himself in medical practice in <b>Amsterdam.</b> He continued his medical research under the physiologists Adriaan Heynsius, Wilhelm Kühne and Thomas Place. In 1867, the Brussels Academy awarded a gold medal to Stokvis for an essay on the development of albuminuria, a kidney disorder in which the protein albumin can be detected in the urine.|$|E
