2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that differences in penis size between individuals are caused not only by genetics, but also by environmental factors such as culture, diet, and chemical or pollution exposure. Endocrine disruption resulting from chemical exposure has been linked to genital deformation in both sexes (among many other problems). Chemicals from both synthetic (e.g., pesticides, anti-bacterial triclosan, plasticizers for plastics) and natural (e.g., chemicals found in tea tree oil and lavender oil) sources have been linked to various degrees of endocrine disruption. Both PCBs and the plasticizer DEHP have been associated with smaller penis size. DEHP metabolites measured from the urine of pregnant women have been significantly associated with the decreased penis width, shorter <b>anogenital</b> <b>distance,</b> and the incomplete descent of testicles of their newborn sons, replicating effects identified in animals. Approximately 25% of US women have phthalate levels similar to those in the study.

The presence of a contiguous male fetus located caudally with respect to uterine blood flow led to the masculinization of male-like behavior in male rats, the defeminization of female like behavior in females and to increased body weights on Day 21 of gestation in both sexes. No significant differences were detected in the remaining parameters.

In the present study, the effects of DEHP exposures on fetal Leydig cells (FLCs) and adult Leydig cells (ALCs) were assessed. Pregnant dams of Long-Evans rats were treated with 0, 10, and 750 mg/kg body weight DEHP from Gestational Day 12. 5 to Postnatal Day (PND) 21. 5. Fetal Leydig cell clustering and FLC-specific gene expression were examined. <b>Anogenital</b> <b>distances</b> (AGDs) of male pups were assessed at PND 2. Serum testosterone levels of male pups and mRNA levels of ALC-specific genes were measured at PNDs 21 and 49. The AGDs of male pups were significantly shorter in the group treated with 750 mg/kg DEHP (mean ± SEM, 3. 68 ± 0. 16 mm) compared with control (4. 62 ± 0. 13 mm). The FLCs were aggregated after 10 and 750 mg/kg DEHP exposures. Several FLC-specific genes, including luteinizing hormone receptor (Lhcgr) and steroidogenic enzyme genes, were downregulated at both doses. Serum testosterone levels were significantly lower compared with control at PND 21 after treatment of 10 or 750 mg/kg DEHP, and continued to be lower even up to 49 days postpartum at the higher dose. The mRNA levels for Lhcgr and steroidogenic enzyme genes were significantly lower at both doses of DEHP at PND 21, whereas {{there were no significant}} differences for these genes at PND 49.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{functions}} of chromosome Y (chrY) genes beyond their effects on sex and reproduction. In hearts, postpubertal testosterone affects the size of cells and the expression of genes differently in male C 57 BL/ 6 J than in their C 57. YA counterparts, where the original chrY has been substituted with that from A/J mice. We further compared the 2 strains to better understand how chrY polymorphisms may affect cardiac properties, the latter being sexually dimorphic but unrelated to sex and reproduction. Genomic regions showing occupancy with androgen receptors (ARs) were identified in adult male hearts from both strains by chromatin immunoprecipitation. AR chromatin immunoprecipitation peaks (showing significant enrichment for consensus AR binding sites) were mostly strain specific. Measurements of <b>anogenital</b> <b>distances</b> in male pups showed that the biologic effects of perinatal androgens were greater in C 57 BL/ 6 J than in C 57. YA. Although perinatal endocrine manipulations showed that these differences contributed to the strain-specific differences in the response of adult cardiac cells to testosterone, the amounts of androgens produced by fetal testes were not different in each strain. Nonetheless, chrY polymorphisms associated in newborn pups' hearts with strain-specific differences in genomic regions showing either AR occupancy, accessible chromatin sites, or trimethylation of histone H 3 Lysine 4 marks, as well as with differential expression of 2 chrY-encoded histone demethylases. In conclusion, the effects of chrY on adult cardiac phenotypes appeared to result from an interaction of this chromosome with the organizational programming effects exerted by the neonatal testosterone surge and show several characteristics of being mediated by an epigenetic remodeling of chromatin.

40|$|Physical {{inactivity}} is {{the underlying}} cause of a large variety of chronic health conditions, is the second leading actual {{cause of death in}} the United States, and is a major contributor to obesity and diabetes. In spite of the strong evidence favoring physical activity as a successful and cost-effective therapy, voluntary activity levels in the United States are extremely low. Given that the most potent biological regulators of daily activity known thus far are the sex hormones (specifically testosterone) and that there are multiple environmental endocrine disruptors (ED) that directly affect sex hormone functioning, it is an intriguing possibility that environmental exposure to ED may directly affect physical activity levels. Mouse dams were treated with benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) or a control substance (sesame oil) on days 9 - 16 of pregnancy. The resulting pups were weaned at three weeks of age and were randomly assigned to a four week, 10 week or 20 week sacrifice group. Daily distance, duration, and speed were measured in pups. All mice were measured weekly to determine body composition. Additionally, blood samples were extracted via a heart stick to be used for later analysis of testosterone in male pups and estrogen in female pups.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} the androgenic and anti-androgenic effects of endocrine disruptors (EDs) alter reproductive function and exert distinct effects on developing male reproductive organs. To further investigate these effects, we used an immature rat model {{to examine the effects}} of di-(2 ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and flutamide (Flu) on the male reproductive system. Immature male SD rats were treated daily with DEHP and Flu on postnatal days (PNDs) 21 to 35, in a dose-dependent manner. As results, the weights of the testes, prostate, and seminal vesicle and <b>anogenital</b> <b>distances</b> (AGD) decreased significantly in response to high doses of DEHP or Flu. Testosterone (T) levels significantly decreased in all DEHP- treated groups, whereas luteinizing hormone (LH) plasma levels were not altered by any of the two treatments at PND 36. However, treatment with DEHP or Flu induced histopathological changes in the testes, wherein degeneration and disorders of Leydig cells, germ cells and dilatation of tubular lumen were observed in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, hyperplasia and denseness of Leydig, Sertoli and germ cells were observed in rats given with high doses of Flu. The results by cDNA microarray analysis indicated that 1, 272 genes were up-regulated by more than two-fold, and 1, 969 genes were down-regulated in response to DEHP, Flu or both EDs. These genes were selected based on their markedly increased or decreased expression levels. These genes have been also classified on the basis of gene ontology (e. g., steroid hormone biosynthetic process, regulation of transcription, signal transduction, metabolic process, biosynthetic process [...] .). Significant decreases in gene expression were observed in steroidogenic genes (i. e., Star, Cyp 11 a 1 and Hsd 3 b). In addition, the expression of a common set of target genes, including CaBP 1, Vav 2, Plcd 1, Lhx 1 and Isoc 1, was altered following exposure to EDs, suggesting that they may be marker genes to screen for the anti-androgenic or androgenic effects of EDs. Overall, our results demonstrated that exposure to DEHP, Flu or both EDs resulted in a alteration of gene expression in the testes of immature male rats. Furthermore, the toxicological effects of these EDs on the male reproductive system resulted from their anti-androgenic effects. Taken together, these results provide a new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the detrimental impacts of EDs, in regards to anti-androgenic effects in humans and wildlife...|$|R

Regrouping gestating sows is a common, stressful production practice, but {{its impact on}} the developing pigs of the sow is not fully known. This study examined the effects of regrouping gestating sows and the administration of exogenous glucocorticoids on the growth and external reproductive morphology of pigs. At 37. 2 ± 0. 26 d of gestation, 6 cohorts of 18 sows (N = 108) were placed in 1 of 3 treatments: socially stable (Stable), hydrocortisone acetate (HCA), or mixed (Mixed). The HCA sows were administered 70 mg HCA, a synthetic glucocorticoid, twice daily during the 21 d experimental period. Each Mixed sow was penned with 2 companion sows (Companion) and regrouped on d 7 and 14 with 2 different Companion sows in a new pen. Stable and HCA sows were penned in treatment groups of 3 sows. Sow social rank was assessed weekly during feeding. After the 21 d experimental period, all sows were housed in gestation stalls for the duration of pregnancy. During the 21 d, Companion sows gained more weight than HCA and Mixed sows (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with Stable sows intermediate. High ranked sows gained more weight than middle and low ranked sows (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Mixed sows had greater head lesion scores than Stable and HCA sows (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with Companion sows intermediate. Head lesions increased with lower social rank (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Sow treatment did not affect farrowing rate, litter size, or sex ratio (P 3 ̆e 0. 10). Social rank also had no effect on farrowing rate (P 3 ̆e 0. 10), but affected total litter size (P = 0. 03). High ranked sows bore and weaned more live females than low ranked sows (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), in part due to differential preweaning mortality among female pigs (P = 0. 01). Only male pigs were affected by sow treatment. Preweaning mortality was higher among male pigs from HCA than from Mixed sows (P = 0. 04) with other treatments intermediate.

Rats exposed in utero to valproic acid did not develop hypospadias and even had a slightly increased <b>anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> in males 3 – 4 days after birth. A classical antiandrogenic drug, flutamide, caused hypospadias as well as a reduction of the <b>anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> in males. At the age of 3 months, rats exposed in utero with either valproic acid or flutamide showed a reduced testicular weight and hypoplasia of tubules, which seemed not {{to be related to the}} antiandrogenic activity of flutamide as it did not correlate with the presence of hypospadias. The mechanism through which valproic acid causes hypospadias in man and affects testicular development in rat is unknown.

OBJECTIVES: The aims {{of this study were}} to develop and implement a protocol for the measurement of anogenital distances in infants and to evaluate the association between maternal fat intake and <b>anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> in male and female infants. The association of mother‟s exposure to dioxin-like compounds with fat intake during pregnancy was also examined in a subsample. METHODS: A pilot study was conducted and comprised of 9 infants. In the current study we measured <b>anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> for 305 infants (158 males and 147 females), 0 to 16 months old. Dietary information was obtained for their mothers, participating in the mother-child cohort study. Measurements were associated with maternal fat intake for 150 mother-child pairs. RESULTS: In the total study population a negative correlation was found between maternal fat intake and anogenital distances, but results were statistically significant only for <b>anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> (AGD), anoscrotal distance (ASD) and penis width (PW) in males. Among newborns, women with high fat intake during pregnancy had more possibilities to give birth to an infant with a phenotype of short <b>anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> regardless of sex, after controlling for maternal and pregnancy related factors. CONCLUSION: Maternal fat intake during pregnancy that could be related to a higher uptake of endocrine disruptors was associated with shorter anogenital distances in males. Further analyses with a larger sample and the use of biomarkers are needed...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> {{in animals}} {{is used as}} a measure of fetal {{androgen}} action. Prenatal exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in rodents causes reproductive changes in male offspring and decreases <b>anogenital</b> <b>distance.</b> OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether in utero exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like compounds adversely influences <b>anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> in newborns and young children (median age, 16 months; range, 1 - 31 months) METHODS: We measured <b>anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> among participants of the "Rhea" mother-child cohort study in Crete and the Hospital del Mar (HMAR) cohort in Barcelona. <b>Anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> (AGD; anus to upper penis), anoscrotal distance (ASD; anus to scrotum), and penis width (PW) were measured in 119 newborn and 239 young boys; anoclitoral (ACD; anus to clitoris) and anofourchetal distance (AFD; anus to fourchette) were measured in 118 newborn and 223 young girls. We estimated plasma dioxin-like activity in maternal blood samples collected at delivery with the Dioxin-Responsive Chemically Activated LUciferase eXpression (DR CALUX®) bioassay. RESULTS: Anogenital distances were sexually dimorphic, being longer in males than females. Plasma dioxin-like activity was negatively associated with AGD in male newborns. The estimated change in AGD per 10 pg CALUX®-toxic equivalent/g lipid increase was - 0. 44 mm (95 % CI: - 0. 80, - 0. 08) after adjusting for confounders. Negative but smaller and nonsignificant associations were observed for AGD in young boys. No associations were found in girls. CONCLUSIONS: Male infants may be susceptible to endocrine-disrupting effects of dioxins. Our findings are consistent with the experimental animal evidence used by the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization to set recommendations for human dioxin intake. This study was partly funded by FP 6 and FP 7 European Union grants (contract number FOOD-CT- 2005 - 016320 and 241604 respectively...|$|E
40|$|Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is {{used for}} malaria control by 10 countries, nine {{of which are in}} Africa. Technical DDT {{contains}} various isomers with 65 - 80 % insecticidal p,p'-DDT and 15 - 21 % o,p'-DDT, an estrogenic chemical, while the persistent metabolite of p,p'-DDT, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), is an antiandrogen. In utero antiandrogenic exposure reduces <b>anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> in animal models and the anal position index in a single study. This study examined the associations between mother's serum DDT and DDE levels at delivery and <b>anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> in their children at birth and age 1 year. Data were collected as part of the Venda Health Examination of Mothers, Babies and their Environment (VHEMBE), a birth cohort study located in rural South Africa. DDT and DDE concentrations were measured in blood samples collected from 752 mothers at delivery. <b>Anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> measurements, taken at birth (n = 671) and age 1 year (n = 674), included anofourchette and anoclitoral distances in girls, and anoscrotal and anopenile lengths in boys. We also measured anococcygeal and coccyx-fourchette distances in girls, while in boys, we measured anococcygeal and coccyx-scrotal distances as well as penile length and penile width. The anal position index is calculated for both sexes as anoscrotal/coccyx-scrotal in boys and anofourchette/coccyx-fourchette in girls. We found no associations between p,p'-DDT/-DDE or o,p'-DDT and <b>anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> measurements at birth in either boys or girls. At 1 year, o,p'-DDE was negatively associated with anofourchette in girls (β =- 1. 32 mm, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = - 2. 27, - 0. 38) and positively associated with penile width in boys (β = 0. 30 mm, 95 % CI = 0. 00, 0. 60). The results do not suggest an overt antiandrogenic or estrogenic effect on <b>anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> after long-term DDT exposure. These weak associations may be due to chance.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> (AGD), {{a sexually}} dimorphic measure of genital development, is a marker for {{endocrine}} disruption in animal studies {{and may be}} shorter in infant males with genital anomalies. Given the correlation between <b>anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> and genital development, we sought to determine if <b>anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> varied in fertile compared to infertile adult men. METHODS: A cross sectional study of consecutive men being evaluated for infertility and men with proven fertility was recruited from an andrology clinic. <b>Anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> (the distance from the posterior aspect of the scrotum to the anal verge) and penile length (PL) were measured using digital calipers. ANOVA and linear regression {{were used to determine}} correlations between AGD, fatherhood status, and semen analysis parameters (sperm density, motility, and total motile sperm count). FINDINGS: A total of 117 infertile men (mean age: 35. 3 ± 17. 4) and 56 fertile men (mean age: 44. 8 ± 9. 7) were recruited. The infertile men possessed significantly shorter mean AGD and PL compared to the fertile controls (AGD: 31. 8 vs 44. 6 mm, PL: 107. 1 vs 119. 5 mm, p< 0. 01). The difference in AGD persisted even after accounting for ethnic and anthropomorphic differences. In addition to fatherhood, on both unadjusted and adjusted linear regression, AGD was significantly correlated with sperm density and total motile sperm count. After adjusting for demographic and reproductive variables, for each 1 cm increase in a man's AGD, the sperm density increases by 4. 3 million sperm per mL (95 % CI 0. 53, 8. 09, p =  0. 03) and the total motile sperm count increases by 6. 0 million sperm (95 % CI 1. 34, 10. 58, p =  0. 01). On adjusted analyses, no correlation was seen between penile length and semen parameters. CONCLUSION: A longer <b>anogenital</b> <b>distance</b> is associated with fatherhood and may predict normal male reproductive potential. Thus, AGD may provide a novel metric to assess reproductive potential in men...|$|E
