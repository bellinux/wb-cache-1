5|$|Such savings <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> {{associations}} {{had been}} deregulated {{in the early}} 1980s, allowing them to make highly risky investments with their depositors' money. Keating and other savings <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> operators took advantage of this deregulation. Savings and loans established connections to many members of Congress, by supplying them with needed funds for campaigns through legal donations.

Hampshire Building <b>and</b> <b>Loan</b> Association No. 1 was incorporated by West Virginia Secretary of State Henry S. Walker on March 11, 1890. White was one of six corporators, with two shares ($35 each), of the Romney Manufacturing, Land and Improvement Company, which was created for the acquisition of land near Romney {{for the establishment of a}} hotel or summer resort and the development of residential real estate. The Romney Manufacturing, Land and Improvement Company was incorporated by Walker's successor, William A. Ohley, on July 10, 1890.|$|E

5|$|The Keating Five {{were five}} United States Senators accused of {{corruption}} in 1989, igniting a major political scandal {{as part of the}} larger Savings <b>and</b> <b>Loan</b> crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The five senators – Alan Cranston (Democrat of California), Dennis DeConcini (Democrat of Arizona), John Glenn (Democrat of Ohio), John McCain (Republican of Arizona), and Donald W.

The ultimate cost of the crisis is estimated to have totaled around $160.1 billion, about $124.6 billion of which was directly {{paid for by the}} U.S. federal government. The accompanying slowdown in the finance industry and the real estate market may have been a contributing cause of the 1990-1991 economic recession.

5|$|The three Britons {{were brought}} to trial on 6 April 1826. Lehuby, still in the Netherlands, was tried in absentia. The Crown prosecution's case was seriously {{hampered}} by his absence, particularly because many key documents were {{with him in the}} Netherlands. The prosecutor alleged a complex conspiracy between MacGregor, Lehuby and their associates to profit personally from a fraudulent land concession <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> prospectus. MacGregor's lawyer, a Frenchman called Merilhou, asserted that if anything untoward had occurred, the missing managing director should be held culpable; there was no proof of a conspiracy, he said, and MacGregor could have been himself defrauded by Lehuby. The prosecutor conceded that there was insufficient evidence to prove his case, complimented MacGregor for co-operating with the investigation fairly and openly, and withdrew the charges. The three judges confirmed the defendants' release—"a full and perfect acquittal", Hippisley would write—but days later the French authorities succeeded in having Lehuby extradited, and the three men learned they would have to stand trial again.|$|E

Theories concerning trade credit granted by industrial firms <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> by financial institutions are broadly divided into those that focus on the differences between the key players, i. e. businesses and financial institutions, and those that focus on the differences between methods, i. e. trade credit <b>and</b> <b>loans.</b> However, empirical studies such as that conducted by Petersen and Rajan (1997) do not necessarily validate theories based on differences in either credit players or credit methods. This paper used newly-available data to examine how much impact differences in players and methods have on the relationship between trade credit <b>and</b> <b>loans.</b> Even when granted by the same player, trade credit <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> can act in completely different ways, while {{it is not uncommon for}} loans or trade credit granted by different players to exhibit the same features. Leading research does not clearly indicate that differences in the nature of credit instruments have a more noticeable impact on the relationship between trade credit <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> than differences in the players do; this is significant when considering players and methods for corporate financing in the future. ...|$|R

Chandler defeated Combs in the primary {{by a vote of}} 259,875 to 241,754 and went on to win his second term as governor. Combs returned to Prestonsburg, set up a savings <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> company, and re-established his law practice. During the four years of Chandler's term, Combs accepted a number of speaking engagements, but otherwise remained out of the public eye. Meanwhile, the state's need for funds compelled Chandler to raise the state sales tax and other taxes, despite his campaign promises not to do so. Consequently, Chandler lost credibility and Combs gained a reputation as a courageous, forthright, and honest politician for having acknowledged the state's financial need during the campaign.|$|E
5|$|New York {{was unable}} to build on their 1970 success. Tarkenton left the team's 1971 {{training}} camp in a salary dispute, before coming back {{a few days later}} after signing a one-year contract. In place of a salary increase, Tarkenton had asked for a large loan to get a tax break, but the Maras turned it down, and made sure the press knew the raise <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> were denied. Johnson missed most of the season with a knee injury, and the Giants dropped to 4–10. Before the 1972 season they traded Tarkenton, who frequently feuded with Webster, back to the Vikings. Initially the trade produced positive results, as New York rallied to finish 8–6 in 1972. The 1972 team was led by veteran journeyman quarterback Norm Snead (acquired in the trade for Tarkenton), who led the league in passing and had the best season of his career. They set a still-standing team record on November 26 when they scored 62 points via eight touchdowns and two field goals. After the 1972 season however, the Giants suffered one of the worst prolonged stretches in their history. Meanwhile, Tarkenton would lead the Vikings to three Super Bowls and establish a Hall of Fame resume.|$|E

For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit will shrink to $1.34trillion, and the 10-year deficit will increase to $8.53trillion or 90% of GDP. The most recent increase in the U.S. debt ceiling to $17.2trillion took effect in February 2014. On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings. By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.|$|E
