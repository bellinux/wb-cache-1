5|$|Cohesion between {{sentences}} is achieved {{through the use}} of deictic pronouns as <b>anaphora</b> (e.g. that is exactly what I mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event). Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true! (the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.|$|E
25|$|Only {{in cases}} of “genuinely {{quantified}} NP’s” is bound <b>anaphora</b> feasible because bound <b>anaphora</b> cannot involve reference or coreference.|$|E
25|$|Previous {{studies on}} <b>anaphora</b> focused on coreference instead of bound <b>anaphora,</b> which {{dictated}} groupings of <b>anaphora</b> facts {{in a specific}} way. Reinhart states that previous analyses focusing primarily on coreference would determine the permissibility of examples (16)-(18) in three different ways. Group (16) would be classified as cases where definite NP coreference is allowed. Definite NP coreference would be deemed impossible in group (17). Finally, group (18) would require special treatment since it deals with cases of quantified NP <b>anaphora.</b> By following these coreference rules, Reinhart notes that examples (16)–(18) would not constitute well-formed sentences.|$|E
50|$|Many ancient {{texts of}} <b>anaphoras</b> have survived, {{and even if}} no more in use, they are useful to trace {{the history of the}} <b>anaphoras,</b> and in general the history of the Eucharist during the centuries. Most of these texts became parts of <b>anaphoras</b> still in use.|$|R
50|$|The Antiochene Maronite Catholic Church {{is one of}} {{the richest}} if not the richest in the number of <b>anaphoras</b> {{contained}} in its Liturgy, most of them belong to the tradition of the Antiochene rites. There are at least seventy-two Maronite <b>Anaphoras.</b>|$|R
50|$|The various <b>Anaphoras</b> {{will have}} slight differences.|$|R
25|$|While bound {{variable}} pronouns {{fall into}} the category of <b>anaphora,</b> there are cases in which bound variable pronouns behave differently from regular <b>anaphora.</b> Take, for instance, the examples below, as presented by Reinhart.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Anaphora</b> follows.|$|E
25|$|Studies on <b>anaphora</b> {{focus on}} the {{conditions}} for definite NP <b>anaphora</b> and avoid the problems with interpreting pronouns. Reinhart clarifies the difference between bound-variable pronouns (ie. bound-anaphora) and coreference (ie. the referential interpretation) and concludes that the bound-variable conditions apply {{to a number of}} seemingly unrelated phenomena, including reflexivization, quantified NP <b>anaphora,</b> and sloppy identity. She argues that the way pronouns can be interpreted and the times at which coreference cannot occur are determined by the syntax of the sentence.|$|E

5000|$|To the Ordo communis, the Syriac Church {{has added}} a very great number of {{alternative}} <b>Anaphoras,</b> {{many of which have}} not been published. These <b>Anaphoras</b> are ascribed to all manner of people; they were composed at very different periods. One explanation of their attribution to various saints is that they were originally used on their feasts.|$|R
5000|$|The more {{important}} currently used <b>anaphoras</b> of the East Syrian Rite are the followings: ...|$|R
25|$|The Second Eucharistic Prayer is an {{abridgement}} of the Roman Canon {{with elements}} included from the <b>Anaphora</b> of the Apostolic Tradition, {{most notably in}} its proper preface and in the Epiclesis. The Third Eucharistic Prayer is a new composition, longer than the Second Eucharistic Prayer, and contains Alexandrian, Byzantine, and Maronite elements. Its structure follows the Roman Canon. It {{is based on the}} 4th-century <b>Anaphora</b> of St Basil. The fourth Eucharistic Prayer is roughly based upon the <b>Anaphora</b> of St Basil, with, among other things, the epiclesis moved before the Institution Narrative.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>anaphoras</b> {{currently}} {{used by the}} Syro-Antiochene Rite (or West Syrian Rite) are numerous and the main are: ...|$|R
5000|$|To {{describe}} {{the structure of}} the <b>Anaphoras</b> as it became standardized from the 4th century, we can look at {{the structure of the}} <b>anaphoras</b> in the Antiochene (or [...] "West Syrian") family of liturgies, which display an order and logic that finds no equal elsewhere. This structure is still valid, with some significant variations typical of each rite, for the Catholic Church, Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Church, while it was modified, both in the pattern and in the underlying theology, during the Protestant Reformation. Beginning with the Oxford Movement of the 1840s and after the Liturgical Reform Movement of the 1950s, a systematic examination of historic <b>anaphoras</b> began and this in turn has caused the reform of many Eucharistic prayers within mainline Protestant denominations.|$|R
5000|$|The Byzantine Rite uses three <b>anaphoras,</b> {{which are}} the core part of the Divine Liturgies which take the same name: ...|$|R
25|$|In the Byzantine Rite, the Nicene Creed is sung or recited at the Divine Liturgy, {{immediately}} {{preceding the}} <b>Anaphora</b> (Eucharistic Prayer), {{and is also}} recited daily at compline.|$|E
25|$|Assyrian ministers are warmly invited (but not obliged) {{to insert}} the Words of Institution in the <b>Anaphora</b> of Addai and Mari when Chaldean {{faithful}} are {{present at the}} liturgy.|$|E
25|$|The Eucharistic Prayers (or Anaphoras) of all {{the present}} Christian Churches that believe in apostolic {{succession}} include the Words of Institution, and the relevant Institution narrative, with the sole exception of some versions of the <b>Anaphora</b> of Addai and Mari.|$|E
5000|$|The Coptic Church, even if its own rite is the Alexandrian Rite, uses two <b>anaphoras</b> {{that belong}} to the literal {{tradition}} of the Antiochene rites: ...|$|R
50|$|The church {{employs the}} Syriac dialect of Eastern Aramaic in its liturgy, the East Syrian Rite, which {{includes}} three <b>anaphoras,</b> attributed to Thaddeus (Addai) and Mari, Theodore of Mopsuestia and later also Nestorius.|$|R
50|$|The various extant <b>anaphoras</b> {{attributed}} to St. Basil {{in the various}} Eastern Christian rites may be classified into two groups: one which includes the Egyptian texts, and one which includes all other texts.|$|R
25|$|Chaldean {{faithful}} {{unable to}} approach a Catholic minister {{are permitted to}} participate and to receive Holy Communion in an Assyrian celebration of the Holy Eucharist, even if celebrated using the <b>Anaphora</b> of Addai and Mari in its form without the Words of Institution.|$|E
25|$|Although, then, it is {{impossible}} to establish any sort of mutual dependence, it is evident that the Roman Canon contains likenesses to the two Eastern rites too exact to be accidental; in its forms it most resembles the Antiochene <b>Anaphora,</b> but in its arrangement it follows, or guides, Alexandria.|$|E
25|$|A {{relative}} clause {{is a kind}} of subordinate clause that contains an element whose interpretation is provided by an antecedent on which the subordinate clause is grammatically dependent; that is, there is an <b>anaphora</b> relation between the relativized element in the {{relative clause}} and the antecedent on which it depends.|$|E

2500|$|The Roman Canon or Eucharistic Prayer I is {{the first}} of four <b>anaphoras</b> or eucharistic prayers for general use in the Roman Rite Mass. Before 1970, it {{was the only one in}} the Roman Missal.|$|R
25|$|The <b>anaphora</b> (Eucharistic prayer) of the Assyrian Church of the East – {{included}} in its Liturgy of Addai and Mari – {{does not contain}} the Words of Institution that recount Jesus' words at the Last Supper. The Holy Leaven thus serves as a physical link with the Last Supper {{in lieu of a}} verbal one.|$|E
25|$|While it is {{possible}} that the Trisagion has origins in the Biblical 'thrice holy' of Isaiah 6:3 (the Sanctus: Holy, holy, holy, Lord of Sabaoth. Heaven and earth are full of your glory', etc.), they are today separate prayers. The latter is used at a different point in the Liturgy (in the Divine Liturgy, during the <b>anaphora).</b>|$|E
25|$|The pro-clitic va and the post-clitic di both mark anaphoric relations. va {{is placed}} {{immediately}} before the noun, and codes for discourse-internal <b>anaphora</b> (that is, {{reference to a}} term {{that has already been}} introduced in the earlier context). di immediately follows the noun, and seems to refer to the immediate context preceding it (comparable with the English anaphoric use of 'this').|$|E
50|$|To {{properly}} identify {{senses of}} words one must know common sense facts. Moreover, sometimes {{the common sense}} is needed to disambiguate such words like pronouns in case of having <b>anaphoras</b> or cataphoras in the text.|$|R

5000|$|With one exception, that of Addai and Mari, all of {{the extant}} <b>anaphoras</b> {{incorporate}} some form of Jesus' words over the bread and wine at the Last Supper: [...] "This is my body" [...] over the bread and, over the wine, [...] "This is my blood." ...|$|R
