25|$|The most {{brilliant}} analysis ever {{done on a}} structural puzzle was surely the solution (1953) of the terramycin problem. It was a problem of great industrial importance, and hence many able chemists had performed {{an enormous amount of}} work trying to determine the structure. There seemed to be too much data to resolve the problem, because a significant number of observations, although experimentally correct, were very misleading. Woodward took a large piece of cardboard, wrote on it <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> and, by thought alone, deduced the correct structure for terramycin.

25|$|The {{traveling}} salesman {{problem is}} {{what is called a}} conventional optimization problem. That is, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> (distances between each destination point) needed to determine the optimal path to follow are known with certainty and the goal is to run through the possible travel choices {{to come up with the}} one with the lowest total distance. However, let's assume that instead of wanting to minimize the total distance traveled to visit each desired destination, we wanted to minimize the total time needed to reach each destination. This goes beyond conventional optimization since travel time is inherently uncertain (traffic jams, time of day, etc.). As a result, to determine our optimal path we would want to use simulation - optimization to first understand the range of potential times it could take to go from one point to another (represented by a probability distribution in this case rather than a specific distance) and then optimize our travel decisions to identify the best path to follow taking that uncertainty into account.|$|E

Fuller felt that Cole did [...] "a decent enough job," [...] claiming that the Siren was the [...] "best-realised thing" [...] about the episode, [...] "only slightly ahead of Karen Gillan looking very fetching in a pirate outfit." [...] Simon Brew of Den of Geek started by comparing the episode to Lost [...] "massive, intriguing" [...] cliffhangers, [...] "and then sauntered off to other less interesting stuff," [...] mainly criticising that the little girl's regeneration in [...] "Day of the Moon" [...] was left unresolved. However, Brew [...] "still enjoyed" [...] "The Curse of the Black Spot", reacting positively to the episode's production values and the reveal of the black spots. Nick Setchfield of the science-fiction based magazine SFX opined that the high points of the episode were that it was [...] "high on shivery maritime atmosphere," [...] and the Doctor for not being [...] "in instant possession of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts,</b> but who reloads his thinking as events unfold."

500|$|The Jefferson–Hemings {{controversy}} {{is related to}} the question of whether, after Jefferson had become a widower, he impregnated Sally Hemings, resulting in his fathering her six children of record. The controversy dates from the 1790s. Jefferson having a sexual relationship with Hemings was first reported in 1802 by one of Jefferson’s enemies, a political journalist named James T. Callender, after he noticed several light skinned slaves at Monticello. Jefferson himself never publicly denied this allegation. However, members of his family did. In the 1850s Jefferson's eldest grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, said that the late Peter Carr, a nephew of Jefferson's, had fathered Hemings' children, rather than Jefferson himself. This information was published and became the common wisdom; most major historians of Jefferson denied Jefferson's paternity for the next 150 years. In the late 20th century, historians began reanalyzing the body of evidence. In 1997, Annette Gordon-Reed published a book, Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy, that analyzed the historiography of the controversy, demonstrating how historians since the 19th century had accepted early assumptions. They favored Jefferson family testimony while criticizing Hemings family testimony as [...] "oral history," [...] and failed to note <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts.</b> A consensus began to emerge after the results of a DNA analysis in 1998, which showed no match between the Carr male line, proposed for more than 150 years as the father(s), and the one Hemings descendant tested. It did show a match between the Jefferson male line and the Eston Hemings descendant.|$|E
