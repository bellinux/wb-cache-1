5|$|Before leaving, Shackleton {{instructed}} Frank Wild {{that he was}} {{to assume}} full command as soon as the James Caird departed, and that should the journey fail, he was to attempt to take the party to Deception Island the following spring. The James Caird was launched from Elephant Island on 24 April 1916. The wind was a moderate south-westerly, which aided a swift getaway, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> was quickly {{out of sight of the}} land.|$|E
5|$|The {{plans for}} Havfruen were {{purchased}} in 1910 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> was {{built at the}} Copenhagen Navy Yard. She was launched on 31 August 1912. She initially received the pennant number of H 1, but was assigned the number 2 in April 1913. She was later designated A 2 when the class {{became known as the}} A class late in her career. Havfruen was the last ship of the class to be removed from service when she was stricken on 3 May 1932.|$|E

5|$|The {{river is}} a {{used by many}} for recreation, with the {{footpaths}} on the riverbanks often filled with cyclists and joggers. Rowers use the lake for training all year round, and many clubs such as the Adelaide University Boat Club, the Adelaide Rowing Club, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> houses of the secondary schools which participate in the annual Head of the River are located upon its banks. Several rowing regattas are held on the Torrens Lake course in the summer months of each year, contested by both club and school crews.|$|E
5|$|During the mid 1990s, Ramiz Sadiku was docked {{for a major}} {{overhaul}} and reconstruction. However, {{due to the lack}} of funds the work was never completed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> was decommissioned and eventually sold for scrap. The boat's superstructure, propulsion, sensors and weapon systems were dismantled, after which the new owner moved the boat to an underground naval dock on the Luštica peninsula. The boat remained there for several years, before its deteriorating condition caused it to sink inside the dock. The wreck was raised in 2014 and towed to Zelenika where it was broken up to smaller segments which were then transported to the Nikšić steel factory.|$|E

60|$|This {{order was}} {{enforced}} by a musket shot which whizzed over <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> {{within an inch}} of the captain's head. The men ceased rowing <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> of <b>the</b> pirate ranged close up.|$|R
5|$|During the night, {{the four}} boats became separated. Bulkeley spent time {{looking for the}} other three boats, {{but was unable to}} find them in the darkness. At dawn he gave up, and headed for one of the {{alternative}} hiding places. Kelly's PT-34 was the first to reach the rendezvous point, a cove on Tagauayan Island, two hours late at 09:30. There was no sign of the other boats, and Rockwell, in the same boat with Kelly, was far from convinced that Kelly had found the correct island. Some repairs were made, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> was refueled by hand pumps from the drums. Two men were posted atop the island's tallest hill to watch out for the Japanese and the other boats.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Bond disguises {{himself as}} one of Largo's henchmen, and uncovers Largo's plan to destroy Miami Beach. Bond is {{discovered}} by Largo, but rescued by Leiter, who orders the United States Coast Guard to parachute to the area via US Air Force transport aircraft. After an underwater battle, the henchmen surrender. Largo escapes to his ship, which h{{as one of}} the bombs on board. As it begins to leave, Bond gets on underwater. The ship is pursued by Royal Navy and U.S. Coast Guard vessels, but Largo jettisons the rear of the ship, revealing the front as a hydrofoil as it escapes. Bond fights Largo on board, and he is about to shoot Bond when Domino, freed by Largo's nuclear physicist Ladislav Kutze, shoots Largo with a harpoon gun. Bond, Domino, and Kutze jump overboard, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> runs aground and explodes. A sky hook-equipped CIA B-17 aircraft then rescues Bond and Domino.|$|E

60|$|The battery, indeed, {{soon began}} to fire again, irregularly, as the guns were loaded.

5|$|Four of {{the voice}} actors from the {{previous}} installment returned to reprise their roles, including Terrence C. Carson and Keith Ferguson, who voiced Kratos <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> captain, respectively. Linda Hunt returned as the narrator, who was revealed to be the Titan Gaia, and Carole Ruggier returned in her final voicing of the character Athena. Both Paul Eiding, who had voiced Zeus and the gravedigger, and Fred Tatasciore, who had voiced Poseidon, returned but did not reprise those roles, and instead voiced the characters Theseus and Typhon, respectively. Corey Burton {{assumed the role of}} Zeus, who had voiced the character in the 1998 Disney animated film , and in the subsequent animated series Hercules. Famed actors Michael Clarke Duncan and Leigh-Allyn Baker lent their voices for the characters Atlas and Lakhesis, respectively. Actor Harry Hamlin was chosen to voice the character Perseus because of his previous portrayal of the same character in the 1981 feature film Clash of the Titans. Although removed early in the game's development, Cam Clarke is credited for the voice of Hercules. Keythe Farley was the voice director alongside Kris Zimmerman and Gordon Hunt.|$|E

25|$|While {{travelling}} {{on route}} {{in a boat}} he encountered a severe storm endangering the boat and all on board. He prayed for deliverance <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> was saved {{and as a consequence}} those on board were converted to Christianity and baptized.|$|E
60|$|On {{the present}} {{occasion}} {{there was no}} consultation, as has been already seen. The traverse was a short one, <b>the</b> morning fine, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> good.
