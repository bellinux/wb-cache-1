40|$|Introduction The aged {{care system}} caters for Australians aged 65 and over (and Indigenous Australians aged 50 and over) who {{can no longer}} live without support in their own home. Care is {{provided}} in people’s homes, {{in the community and}} in residential aged care facilities (nursing homes) by a wide variety of providers. The Australian Government is the primary funder and regulator of the system. Total government expenditure on aged care services was around $ 15. 8 billion in 2014 – 15, with the Australian Government providing approximately 95 per cent of this funding. The Aged Care Act 1997 (the Act) and associated Aged Care Principles set out the legislative framework for the funding and regulation of aged care, although services are also provided through contractual arrangements outside of the Act. The Australian Government Department of Health (DoH) is responsible for the operation of the Act. This quick guide provides a brief overview of aged care in Australia. It describes the types of care provided, <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> accessing subsidised care, statistics on aged care, the organisations that provide care, and the regulatory <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>ensuring</b> quality care. The quick guide does not describe care that is provided outside of the formal aged care system, such as care provided by family members or accommodation in retirement villages...|$|R

40|$|The {{structures}} and processes established within an institution offering Islamic financial Services (IIFS) for monitoring and evaluating Shariah compliance rely essentially on arrangements internal to the firm. By being {{incorporated in the}} institutional structure, a Shariah supervisory board (SSB) {{has the advantage of}} being close to the market. Competent, independent, and empowered to approve new Shariah-conforming instruments, an SSB can enable innovation likely to emerge within the institution. The paper reviews the issues and options facing current <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>ensuring</b> Shariah compliance by IIFS. It suggests a framework that draws on internal and external arrangements to the firm and emphasizes market discipline. In issuing its fatwas, an SSB could be guided by standardized contracts and practices that could be harmonized by a self-regulatory professionals'association. A framework with the suggested internal and external features could ensure adequate consistency of interpretation and enhance the enforceability of contracts before civil courts. The review of transactions would mainly be entrusted to internal review units, which would collaborate with external auditors responsible for issuing an annual opinion on whether the institution's activities has met its Shariah requirements. This process would be sustained by reputable entities such as rating agencies, stock markets, financial media, and researchers who would channel signals to market players. This framework would enhance public understanding of the requirements of Shariah and lead to more effective options available to stakeholders to achieve improvements in Islamic financial services.

This thesis explores the recent reforms and the impact they are having on the existing principle of judicial independence, with a view to recommending the notion of institutional autonomy as a means of further securing that independence. The rationale for further legislative protection and investigation of this constitutional principle is found within the requisites of the rule of law. The method for achieving a sufficient degree of institutional autonomy is a stricter adherence to the separation of powers doctrine. The notion of institutional autonomy is considered in detail and the various elements are outlined. These are then applied to the United Kingdom Supreme Court to assess the current degree of institutional autonomy and make recommendations <b>for</b> <b>ensuring</b> greater <b>independence</b> in accordance with the intentions of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. ...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographyThe present {{document}} was {{prepared by the}} ECLAC Women and Development Unit for the International Meeting on Gender Statistics and Indicators for Measuring the Incidence of and Trends in Violence against Women in Latin America and the Caribbean (La Paz, Bolivia, 21 - 23 November 2001). The document reflects the inputs which the participants provided for the working paper submitted by ECLAC at that event. It is a tool for measuring the incidence of violence against women in intimate relationships, {{as well as the}} main characteristics of the phenomenon. The first part describes how the problem of violence against women came to be part of national, regional and international public agendas. One of the problems detected in the enforcement of the relevant laws is the lack of sufficient and adequate follow-up mechanisms for monitoring the application of penalties. This document represents an attempt to meet that need by providing indicators that make it possible to carry out the consultation processes that result in the formulation of public policy. The second part presents a classification and non-exhaustive analysis of the surveys and administrative records used to measure violence against women in recent years. This part also highlights the challenges that should be analyzed and considered in adapting and improving such sources as statistically valid inputs for the construction of indicators. The third and final part presents a minimum set of indicators {{in the form of a}} proposal to be considered by the countries of the region. The proposal aims to strike a balance between what is ideal and what is possible by attempting to complement efforts already under way while incorporating characteristics, purposes and objectives that go beyond the bare minimum. The document concludes by suggesting institutional <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>ensuring</b> that the implementation of this set of indicators is integrated into the process of institutionalizing public policies with a gender perspective...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between EU Competition policy and EU Cohesion policy {{is at best}} one of ambiguity and at worst one of direct conflict. While EU Cohesion policy explicitly intervenes to alter economic outcomes, EU Competition policy aims to ensure that State intervention does {{not interfere with the}} smooth functioning of the internal market or distort competition to an extent contrary to the common interest. EU Competition policy predates EU Cohesion policy by several decades. EU Cohesion policy in its current form dates back {{to the end of the}} 1980 s, which saw the radical restructuring and upgrading of a policy that had until then largely been an adjunct to national regional policies. By contrast, EU Competition policy was enshrined in the Treaty from the outset. It is clear that, back in the 1950 s, the authors of the Treaty perceived the risks to the common market that lay in allowing Member States unfettered use of subsidies. Moreover, although the original provisions have been subject to extensive interpretation, the fundamental principle has remained unchanged since the outset: State aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition in the EU is prohibited, subject to certain exceptions. Given this context, EU-sponsored intervention in the form of the Structural Funds arguably sits uneasily with the precepts of State aid control, and there remain significant conceptual and practical difficulties in reconciling EU Cohesion and Competition policies, especially given that the Structural Funds Regulations impose specific requirements on the Member States which make State aid compliance issues of particular relevance to Structural Fund Managing Authorities. The aim of this article is to explore those issues and examine how they have been addressed in practice. It draws on a mix of desk research and interviews with staff working on the implementation of Structural Funds programmes and in State aid compliance. The article starts with an examination of definitional issues associated with State aid and briefly reviews the scope of admissible aid. It then covers the institutional and procedural <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>ensuring</b> compliance with the State aid rules, and concludes by highlighting some key areas of difficulty where tensions remain unresolved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{draws upon}} an {{empirical}} study and combines moral philosophical insights and sociological analysis {{to shed light}} on the ethical issues in intensive care. It is argued that moral philosophical debate often leaves aside the social context in which ethical decisions are taken and carried through. In order to gain an understanding of how intensive care is accomplished and specifically how ethical issues are handled, the study focused primarily on nurses' accounts of and views on the practices which form the everyday work of intensive care. A qualitative approach was adopted involving theoretical sampling and the constant comparative method of analysis. The paper argues that the most difficult ethical issue in intensive care, namely the withholding or withdrawal of treatment, is an area in which nursing and medical perspectives are often at odds. However, when the social context of clinical practice is taken into account, this paper argues, there is common ground between the two professions. It was found that the period during which the decision to withdraw treatment is being made, the members of the intensive care team closest to the bedside, nursing and medical staff, become impatient for some resolution of the situation. The differences of opinion which arise over the decision to withdraw are not simply {{to do with the way}} in which the situation is experienced by each professional group, proximity to the patient had a part to play in shaping their views rather than, as it is sometimes presumed, a simple rift between medicine and nursing. The data suggest that intensive care has to be a team effort. Even though there is no legal requirement for nurses to agree with the ICU decisions, there seems to be a strong desire within the intensive care team that moral consensus should be achieved in the interests of good patient care. Intensive care relies on the integrity of the team and the unfailing functioning of teamwork. Consequently, achieving this, it seems, is more important than other temporary lapses in interprofessional relations and disagreements over treatment in individual cases. Consensus is important and its achievement is a central, day to day working <b>arrangement</b> <b>for</b> <b>ensuring</b> the solidarity of the team.

The current study focuses on mobile remote presence (MRP) systems as used by a population who could potentially benefit from more social connectivity and communication with remote people — older adults. Communication technologies are important <b>for</b> <b>ensuring</b> safety, <b>independence,</b> and social support for older adults, thereby potentially improving their quality of life and maintaining their independence [24]. However, before such technologies would be accepted and used by older adults, it is critical to understand their perceptions of the benefits, concerns, and adoption criteria for MRP systems. As such, we conducted a needs assessment with twelve volunteer participants (ages 63 - 88), who were given first-hand experience with both meeting a visitor via the MRP system and driving the MRP system to visit that person. The older adult participants identified benefits such as being able to see and be seen via the MRP system, reducing travel costs and hassles, and reducing social isolation. Among the concerns identified were etiquette of using the MRP, personal privacy, and overuse of the system. Some new use-cases were identified that have not yet been explored in prior work, for example, going to museums, attending live performances, and visiting friends who are hospitalized. The older adults in the current study preferred to operate the MRP themselves, rather than to be visited by others operating the MRP system.
