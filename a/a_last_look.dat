500|$|While the Forerunner {{ships are}} being activated, Anders escapes through a {{teleportation}} device and is rescued. Cutter decides {{to destroy the}} Forerunner fleet rather than allow the Covenant to use it. Anders formulates a plan to detonate the ship's faster-than-light drive in the planet's sun, as the explosion would cause a supernova. Before they can prepare the reactor, Forge and the Spartans are ambushed by the Arbiter and his Elites. The Spartans dispatch the aliens and Forge kills the Arbiter. The reactor is damaged during the fight, necessitating a manual detonation. Forge volunteers for the suicidal task, telling the Spartans {{that they will be}} needed in the coming fight. The Spirit of Fire escapes just as Forge overloads the reactor, destroying the Forerunner fleet. Without its faster-than-light drive, the Spirit of Fire is left drifting in space. The crew enters cryonic sleep for long-term storage as Cutter takes <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at Forge's empty cryonic tube. If the game is completed on the [...] "Legendary" [...] difficulty mode, Serina wakes Cutter and tells him that [...] "something has happened".|$|E

500|$|Trott {{retained}} the captaincy when Andrew Stoddart returned to Australia with his English team in 1897–98. Stoddart's team got {{away to a}} good start when they won the First Test in Sydney by [...] nine wickets, K. S. Ranjitsinhji scoring 175runs. With Joe Darling, Trott devised a plan to curb Ranjitsinhji's run scoring. [...] An exponent of the leg glance, [...] "Ranji" [...] would take <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at the field before he took guard. [...] Taking advantage of this fact, after he took strike, the Australians deliberately weakened the off side with two men placed about [...] away from him. [...] Bowling a leg side line, the Australians aimed for a catch from a shot played to that side. Darling said of the plan, [...] "As soon as he had his last look and the bowler was at the point of delivering the ball, we shifted positions by a few yards, sometimes one way, sometimes the other. [...] Occasionally, only one would move and sometimes none would move. [...] This eventually put him clean off his game." [...] The English captain Archie MacLaren agreed saying, [...] "Ranji is in a blue funk". Regardless of the tactics, Ranji made 457runs at an average of 50.77 for the Test series.|$|E

Also seen are forty episodes from the last life of the Lord Buddha, beginning with an image of Setaketu Deva to Prince Siddhartha peeping through the tapestry for <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at his consort Yasodhara and his newborn son Rahula, {{before he left the}} palace for the life of recluse in the forest.|$|E
2500|$|Margaret {{was finally}} called on Thursday {{afternoon}} and she arrived the next morning. [...] However, Lukwiya's colleagues were strict in the protocols. [...] While {{she was forced}} to sit on a stool three feet away from his bed, she was eventually allowed to hold his foot through three layers of glove. [...] On Sunday, his breathing had become so laboured that he was put on a respirator. [...] By early Monday evening the oxygen level of his blood was rising and his pulse was near normal. [...] It appeared that he might pull through but later that evening Lukwiya's lungs began haemorrhaging, a worst-case scenario. [...] Lukwiya died at 1:20 am on Tuesday, 5 December 2000. [...] When Margaret was informed and came to the ward, the body had already been put into a polyethylene bag. [...] When she asked if they could unzip it a little so she could have <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>look,</b> she was refused; the body was too infectious to take any risks.|$|E
