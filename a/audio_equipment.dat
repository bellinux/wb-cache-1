40|$|Abstract — Audio {{signals are}} often {{contaminated}} by background environment noise and buzzing or humming noise from <b>audio</b> <b>equipments.</b> <b>Audio</b> denoising aims at attenuating the noise while retaining the underlying signals. Removing noise from audio signals requires a nondiagonal processing of time-frequency coefficients to avoid producing “musical noise. ” A block thresholding estimation procedure is introduced, which adjusts all parameters adaptively to signal property by minimizing a Stein {{estimation of the}} risk. Non Diagonal time-frequency audio denoising algorithm attenuates the noise by processing each spectrogram coefficient independently. This Estimator is to minimize the error between clean signal and the enhanced signal. Numerical experiments demonstrate the performance and robustness of this procedure through objective and subjective evaluations...|$|R
