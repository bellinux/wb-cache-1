5000|$|Maria Theresa, {{with her}} {{sovereign}} decision from October the 2nd 1776, {{gave up the}} possession of Fiume, that so far belonged to the Habsburgs, {{and give it to}} the Hungarian kingdom, with a view of fostering its trade. Since Hungary proper was distant some 500 km, according to the act, understandably, the city was annexed to Croatia whose territory began right beyond the city walls.Although Croatia, as a kingdom, was united with Hungary and together they formed the [...] "Lands of the Holy Crown of St Stephen", the Fiumani protested, and with support of the Hungarian Vice Regency Council, {{two and a half years}} later, Maria Theresa (as Queen of Hungary) enacted the royal rescript on April, the 23rd 1779, with whom Fiume was annexed to Hungary directly as a corpus separatum <b>adnexum</b> sacra hungaricae coronae.From that moment on the two kingdoms never ceased to batter on the issue whose was Fiume. The Fiumani, as a third part, gave their reading that Fiume (or better: the corpus separatum) was autonomous from both. Given the institutional instability that characterized the whole period from 1779 up to 1848, this was more or less true.Fiume retained the autonomous status from the surrounding territory it enjoyed with the Habsburgs, since the function of the Governor was preserved, and who was now always drawn from the ranks of the Hungarian aristocracy. Fiume was the only city in Hungary (Croatia included) that had such an institution. The development of the port needed huge investments that only Hungary could offer and the leaning of all the local forces towards Hungary appears inevitable.|$|E
30|$|A 30 -year-old Asian patient {{presented}} to the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain. She had previously delivered two children vaginally and had {{been found to have}} a positive pregnancy test the week before. Oligomenorrhoea, possibly due to her history of hyperprolactinaemia, meant that her dates were uncertain. Serum βhCG level was approximately 1, 500  IU/l and trans-vaginal ultrasound failed to demonstrate an intra-uterine pregnancy. Instead, a mass was seen in the left <b>adnexum</b> measuring 4.1 [*]×[*] 2.4 [*]×[*] 5.1  cm with free fluid in the pouch of Douglas. The right <b>adnexum</b> appeared to contain an ovarian cyst measuring 8.1 [*]×[*] 6.6 [*]×[*] 5.4  cm.|$|E
40|$|A case of {{comprehensive}} laparoscopic surgical staging for ovarian dysgerminoma in a 13 -year-old girl is described. A 20 -cm pelvic mass, rising from right <b>adnexum,</b> was incidentally diagnosed, {{and the patient}} underwent laparoscopic right salpingo-oophorectemy. Pathologic findings were consistent with diagnosis of pure dysgerminoma. We then performed laparoscopic staging including peritoneal washing; resection of right infundibulopelvic ligament; systematic pelvic, common iliac, and infrarenal paraaortic lymphadenectomy; appendectomy; and infracolic omentectomy. Uterus and left <b>adnexum</b> were spared to preserve future fertility. Currently, the patient is alive and free of disease after 21 months of follow-up. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} reported case {{of comprehensive}} laparoscopic surgical staging for ovarian neoplasm in a 13 -year-old patien...|$|E
30|$|Diagnostic {{laparoscopy}} later {{performed in}} view {{of a history of}} subfertility, deep dyspareunia, cyclical rectal pain and severe backache demonstrated endometriotic deposits in the pouch of Douglas and right ovary, the left tube and ovary were fixed and densely adherent to the pelvic side wall and the left <b>adnexum</b> obscured by omental adhesions.|$|E
30|$|Adnexal torsion is a {{condition}} that may result in serious consequences, including adnexa removal. Recently, de-torsion has replaced salpingo-oophorectomy as the treatment for a twisted ischaemic <b>adnexum,</b> {{and the best way}} to do it seems to be laparoscopic surgery. A case of adnexal torsion caused by a giant para-ovarian cyst treated, with good results, by a conservative laparoscopic approach is reported.|$|E
30|$|Two {{weeks after}} her {{discharge}} from hospital, the patient {{presented to the}} emergency department with recurrent abdominal pain. Trans-abdominal ultrasound revealed a left ovarian cyst measuring 5.5 [*]×[*] 4.4 [*]×[*] 2.8  cm and a large haemorrhagic mass in the right <b>adnexum</b> with a volume of 252  cc. At laparotomy, a simple cyst of the left ovary was excised. The conserved right ovary was enlarged and necrotic. An oophorectomy was, therefore, performed.|$|E
30|$|A 22 -year-old, Caucasian patient {{presented}} to the emergency department at 12  weeks into her third pregnancy. She had previously experienced one first trimester miscarriage and one first trimester termination of pregnancy. She complained of left iliac fossa pain with no vaginal loss. Trans-abdominal ultrasound confirmed a viable pregnancy, but also demonstrated two simple cysts within the left <b>adnexum</b> measuring 6.5 [*]×[*] 5.6 [*]×[*] 4.9  cm and 6.4 [*]×[*] 5.7 [*]×[*] 5.2  cm. The right ovary appeared normal.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 36 -year-old woman with primary {{infertility}} of six-year duration who had IVF/ICSI on account of male factor infertility. Transvaginal scanning done on the 30 th day following embryo transfer revealed an empty uterine cavity with two gestational sacs containing active fetal echoes in the right <b>adnexum.</b> Patient reluctantly had right salpingectomy via open laparatomy. The patient had repeat embryo transfer eleven months afterwards that culminated in the delivery of living twins with a fetal papyraceous...|$|E
30|$|Her IVF {{treatment}} was abandoned at this stage. She returned {{home after a}} week, but was readmitted into hospital because of persistent abdominal distension and pain. Her subsequent management was multi-disciplinary and included a gynaecologist, general surgeon and a physician. Emergency diagnostic laparoscopy was performed and 5  l of haemorrhagic fluid were drained. There were also endometriotic lesions on the right ovary, with the left <b>adnexum</b> buried in a mass of small and large bowel. As she was not bowel prepared, exploratory surgery was not carried out.|$|E
30|$|Adnexal torsion is {{more common}} {{on the right side}} [1, 4]. Although an ovarian mass is widely {{believed}} to be the precipitating cause, torsion may occur in apparently normal <b>adnexum,</b> particularly in children. In cases where an adnexal abnormality is present, para-ovarian and para-tubal masses {{are most likely to be}} encountered. A benign dermoid cyst is the most common ovarian mass to undergo torsion. Benign masses are more likely to undergo torsion and malignancy is found in less than 5 % of torsions [1, 16, 17].|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} {{spontaneous}} unilateral live tubal twin pregnancy {{in a patient}} {{with a history of}} previous ectopic pregnancy (EP) and tubal surgery. Transvaginal ultrasound showed one pregnancy sac containing two fetal poles with cardiac activity, which appeared to be sited within the right <b>adnexum.</b> The right tubal EP was removed by salpingectomy. Ultrasound findings of suspected adnexal mass and free liquid in the Douglas pouch along with an increased a beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin levels, especially in association of risk factors, can help the early diagnosis of EP and reduce the related mortality and morbidity...|$|E
30|$|The {{first case}} {{in this series}} was {{performed}} on the recommendation of Dr Valentino Bergamini from Verona who was visiting the senior author’s (ARBS) operating theatre in Manchester. A 14 -year-old girl presented with abdominal pain due to a torted <b>adnexum</b> secondary to a para-tubal cyst as illustrated in the photograph. The ovary is seen to be oedematous and discoloured. The quick, uneventful recovery from conservative surgery and the subsequent ultrasonic evidence of normal ovarian function encouraged the authors to employ conservative management of ovarian torsion in emergency cases which have since presented to the hospital.|$|E
40|$|A 28 -year {{old woman}} {{presented}} at eight weeks and {{four days of}} gestation, according to her menstrual dates, complaining of painless vaginal bleeding for three days. Her urinary pregnancy test was positive. Initial transvaginal ultrasound demonstrated an irregular complex structure with a fluid filled centre in the right <b>adnexum.</b> Despite the diagnosis of a possible underlying unruptured right tubal ectopic pregnancy, she declined surgical intervention and was managed expectantly as an inpatient. When she complained of increasing abdominal pain with haemodynamic instability, an emergency laparotomy was performed and a diagnosis of bilateral tubal ectopic pregnancy was made. Case repor...|$|E

30|$|Adnexal torsion (AT) is {{the fifth}} most common {{surgical}} gynaecological emergency and, therefore, requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Mostly, it occurs in the child-bearing age group, with a frequency of 2.7 % of all gynaecological emergencies, {{but it is not}} uncommon in premenarchal girls (15 %) or postmenopausal women (15 %) [1]. This entity consists of total or partial rotation of the <b>adnexum</b> around its vascular axis that induces a venous and lymphatic blockage leading to gangrene and haemorrhagic necrosis. It usually presents as a sudden, continuous, non-specific pain in the lower abdomen. When AT is suspected, a prompt laparoscopic approach is indicated to confirm the diagnosis and to avoid irreversible ovarian damage [2]. Ultrasound findings and Doppler flow study, in addition to the clinical symptoms, may help to achieve diagnosis [3]. Definitive diagnosis would be with laparoscopy or laparotomy examination. The aetiology is unknown. In most cases, an ovarian tumour is present. Torsion of a normal sized ovary is extremely rare. Large and heavy ovarian cysts, such as benign cystic teratoma or polycystic ovaries, seem to be prone to torsion. Comerci et al [4] reported an incidence of 3.5 % torsions in a series of 517 patients with benign cystic teratomas. Cysts smaller than 5  cm are infrequently a cause of torsion. After pelvic inflammatory disease and pelvic endometriosis, torsion is rare, owing to associated pelvic adhesions, even if an endometrioma is present. Until recently, the standard management of the twisted ischaemic <b>adnexum</b> was salpingo-oophorectomy. Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} de-torsion is an alternative mode of treatment [5, 6]. The advantages of ovarian preservation are clear, because AT occurs most often in adolescent girls and in women of child-bearing age. Although the size of the cyst is often the limiting factor for laparoscopic management, in selected cases it may be a safe option.|$|E
30|$|A 25 -year-old woman, gravida 3, para 3, {{with regular}} menstrual cycles, intrauterine device as a {{contraceptive}} method, and with previous history of renal colic, {{was admitted to}} the hospital after the onset of right renal pain with nausea and vomiting. There was tenderness on deep abdominal palpation, with evident abdominal guarding. An ultrasound scan revealed a large cystic mass of dense content that appeared to depend on the right <b>adnexum</b> and was on the uterus. The mass measured 117  mm[*]×[*] 89  mm. Colour and spectral Doppler findings were absence of vascularisation both peripherally and inside the mass, according with signs of hypoperfusion. The blood investigations revealed moderate anaemia and leukocytosis with left deviation, serum tumour marker values (CA 125, CA 19.9) within the normal ranges, and negative findings for serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG).|$|E
40|$|The Hungarian-Croatian Compromise was {{regulated}} by the article XXX of 1868, reached between the Parlament of Hungarian Kingdom {{on the one hand}} and the Sabor of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia on the other hand. The article XXX of 1868 turned to be a joint basic law of Hungary and of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia. Hungary and Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia form one state unity, alike towards to the other territories under His Majesty’s rule and towards other countries. Fiume, the only important harbour of Hungary and district of Fiume form a „separatum sacrae regni coronae <b>adnexum</b> corpus”, with regard to whose special autonomy and the legislative and administrative conditions. A new aggreement is to be reached by means of negotiations between the Hungarian Parliament, the Sabor of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia and the town of Fiume for a joint understanding...|$|E
30|$|Available {{procedures}} include either resection {{when the}} tube cannot be salvaged, or untwisting and fixation {{of the tube}} if torsion is incomplete and/or recent and the tubal tissues remain viable, primarily in young women wishing to preserve their fertility [7, 12]. The obvious effects on the fertility of a patient with fallopian tube torsion should be viewed under the possibility of subsequent torsion and necrosis of the contralateral <b>adnexum,</b> especially if the patient is young. Pregnancy has been reported after detorsion [14]. The differentiation between necrosis with strangulation of the twisted tube and potential viability is, nevertheless, extremely challenging, {{and there is the}} theoretical risk of pulmonary embolism if untwisting is performed after thrombosis of the vascular supply of the tube [12]. Kruger and Heller [15] found that the surgeon’s description of the adnexae at the time of surgery was a reliable predictor of the microscopic appearance of the necrosis.|$|E
30|$|Isolated torsion of the {{fallopian tube}} in perimenopausal women is very rare. A patient who {{presented}} with an adnexal mass with possible ovarian torsion {{and with a}} raised Ca 19 - 9 titer is reported. A 48 -year-old perimenopausal woman had acute lower right abdominal pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Ultrasonographic studies revealed a multiloculated cystic mass in the right <b>adnexum,</b> and Ca 19 - 9 was raised. The symptoms worsened, and emergency laparoscopy and salpingoophorectomy were performed. Histology revealed isolated fallopian tube torsion with a benign ovarian cyst. Torsion of the fallopian tube, although rare, should always be considered {{as part of the}} differential diagnosis of any symptomatic pelvic mass, even in a perimenopausal woman. Characteristic ultrasonographic and CT findings have been reported, an early diagnosis can be made, and an endoscopic, less radical procedure will be the treatment of choice resulting in shorter hospitalization, increased patient satisfaction, and more cost benefits.|$|E
30|$|Successful {{laparoscopic surgery}} {{was carried out}} 20  days after her fourth cycle of {{chemotherapy}} and included a laparoscopic total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy with stripping of the surrounding pelvic peritoneum and supracolic omentectomy. The surgery was carried out using Harmonic ACE™. At laparoscopy, there was no ascites, uterus was of normal size and mobile with a small volume left adnexal mass present. There was no obvious uterine serosal disease or omental nodularity but the pelvic peritoneum in the left <b>adnexum</b> appeared abnormal and was widely excised en bloc together with the uterus, tubes and ovaries. The liver and diaphragm appeared normal. All visible disease was excised but no node dissection was performed. Blood loss was 200  mL and she made a routine postoperative recovery and was discharged the following day. The histology showed carcinoma within the full thickness of the left fallopian tube and paratubal tissue extending into the serosa at the left cornua of the uterus. Left ovary, right tube, ovary, parametria, uterus, cervix and omentum were free of disease. Excision margins were clear of disease. She restarted her chemotherapy 2  days post-operatively with no delay in her treatment schedule. She is 20  months post treatment and disease free.|$|E
30|$|Up {{until the}} 1990 s, AT had been managed by adnexectomy {{because of the}} belief that de-torsion would {{increase}} the risk of pulmonary embolism from the twisted pedicle, and the necrotic ovary could predispose the patient to disseminated intravascular coagulation or pulmonary collapse with the release of vasoactive substances from ischaemic tissues [10]. However, some authors have demonstrated that de-torsion of the twisted adnexa preserves ovarian function and does not {{increase the risk of}} pulmonary embolism, in comparison with excision without untwisting [11, 12]. The patient we have report on did not have any complication. Several studies have shown that estimation of the degree of necrosis during surgery is inaccurate [13]. Colour, size and oedema of the twisted ischaemic adnexa usually do not reflect the real damage to the ovarian tissue, and, probably, the colour is due to venous stasis, because venous flow is the first to be compromised. On the other hand, the ovary has double arterial irrigation, from the aorta and the uterine arteries, that allows long periods of torsion without ischaemia; thus, de-torsion is probably the only technical treatment. The twisted ischaemic <b>adnexum</b> appears oedematous and friable, and it is liable to be traumatised. De-torsion should, therefore, be performed with care, and preferably with blunt instruments if laparoscopy is used. Ovarian function is preserved in 88 % to 100 % of cases [14]. There is no need to extend the duration of operation to observe ovarian reperfusion. Recurrence of ovarian torsion is rare.|$|E
