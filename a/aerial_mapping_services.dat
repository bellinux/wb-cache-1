What {{we wanted to find}} out was the actual accuracy that can be reliably achieved using a UAV to collect data under field conditions throughout a 2 Ha site. We flew a UAV over the test area in a “lawnmower track ” pattern with an 80 % front and 80 % side overlap; we placed 45 ground markers as check points and surveyed them in using network Real Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK GPS). We specifically designed the ground markers to meet our accuracy needs. We established 10 separate ground markers as control points and inputted these into our photo modelling software, Agisoft PhotoScan. The remaining GPS coordinated check point data were added later in ArcMap to the completed orthomosaic and digital elevation model so we could accurately compare the UAV photogrammetry XYZ data with the RTK GPS XYZ data at highly reliable common points. The accuracy we achieved throughout the 45 check points was 95 % reliably within 41 mm horizontally and 68 mm vertically and with an 11. 7 mm groun...|$|R

40|$|Accurate geo-location of {{remotely}} sensed {{image is}} the basis of various advanced tasks, such as image fusion, image mosaic, change detection, etc. Although rigorous sensor model or vender-provided RPC model can be utilized to perform direct geo-location, the accuracy of the models is limited by the interior and exterior orientation parameters. Consequently, ground control points (GCPs) are of great importance to perform precise geometric rectification in practical applications, which is commonly collected from the reference images. In this paper, we suggest a novel approach to automatically collect GCPs from online <b>aerial</b> <b>maps,</b> for free or with a low cost (to purchase an API key). The online <b>aerial</b> <b>maps</b> consist of various data sources, which are lined up in a number of zoom levels using a single projection for the entire world. Firstly, the initial imaging model (rigorous sensor model or RPC model) is used to calculate the geographic extent of the sensed image, and the best zoom level of the online <b>aerial</b> <b>maps</b> is determined by the resolution of the sensed image. Secondly, we use the Static <b>Maps</b> API <b>Service</b> of online <b>aerial</b> <b>maps,</b> i. e. sending a URL (Uniform Resource Locater) request, to fetch the required reference image tiles (256 × 256 pixels) automatically. Thirdly, the corresponding sensed image tiles can be extracted from the sensed image according to the extents of the reference image tiles. Finally, for each pair of tile images, the SIFT matching method is applied to find the matched points. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides a very practical way to collect ground control points conveniently and efficiently, which can be immediately applied to rectify the remotely sensed images. 1...|$|R
