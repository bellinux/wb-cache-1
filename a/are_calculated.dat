The operators collect these fares by selling electronic data-storing tickets, the prices of which <b>are</b> <b>calculated</b> based on {{the distance between the}} start and destination stations. These prices increase in fixed stages for standard non-discounted travel. Fares <b>are</b> <b>calculated</b> in increments based on approximate distances between stations, in contrast to the use of fare zones in other subway systems, such as the London Underground.|$|E
