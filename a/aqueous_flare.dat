40|$|Purpose: Inflammatory {{cataracts}} {{secondary to}} Behcet’s disease (BD) or Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH) {{are thought to}} result from a pathological dysregulation of cytokines {{that is different from}} that of age-related (AR) cataracts. However, {{little is known about the}} function of cytokines in the development of inflammatory cataracts. The purpose of this study was to identify possible differences in cytokine expression in inflammation- and age-related cataract patients. Methods: Analysis techniques involving the concomitant use of a cocktail of antibody-coated non-magnetic beads were used to determine the cytokine expression profiles of BD, VKH and AR cataract patients. Furthermore, anterior chamber <b>aqueous</b> <b>flares</b> and inflammatory cells were quantitatively measured with a laser flare cell meter (LFCM). Results: The expressions of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), IL- 4, IL- 6, IL- 10, IL- 17 A, and interferon-c (IFN-c) were analyzed in aqueous humor (AqH), phytohemagglutinin (PHA) -stimulated and non-PHA-stimulated cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the three types of cataract patients. IL- 6 and IFN-c were identified above the detection limits, but, among the BD and VKH cataract patients, only the levels of IL- 6 were significantly higher in both the AqH and PBMC non-PHA cultures compared with the levels observed in the AR cataract patients. In contrast, IFN-c was significantly elevated in the AqH of the BD cataract patients compared with the VKH and AR cataract patients. In the PHA-stimulated PBMC cultures, IL- 2, IFN-c, IL- 6, and IL- 17 A were significantly increased, and the IL- 6 level was significantly higher in the VKH patients than in th...|$|R

Methods: Ten patients receiving treatment with HCQ and no ophthalmic symptoms were enrolled. After complete ocular examination, mfERG and laser flare-cell photometry were performed. Patients were also {{divided into two}} subgroups with HCQ cumulative dose (CD) higher or lower than 500 g. Results obtained were compared with a control group of ten healthy subjects and statistical analysis was performed. Results: In patients receiving HCQ treatment, mfERG P 1 -wave in ring 2 showed {{a significant reduction in}} amplitude and a significant increase in latency compared to healthy control subjects, respectively resulting in 1. 143 µV vs 1. 316 µV (P= 0. 040) and 38. 611 ms vs 36. 334 ms (P= 0. 024). These changes are highly related to CD. Furthermore, when using the laser flare-cell photometry, a significant increase in <b>aqueous</b> humor <b>flare</b> and cellularity was shown in patients with CD higher than 500 g, resulting in a mean value of 14. 4 ph/ms compared to 8. 1 ph/ms in patients with CD lower than 500 g (P= 0. 0029). These reports appear highly related to CD (P= 0. 001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed mfERG P 1 -wave amplitude in ring 2 as the most sensitive value in detecting early HCQ-related retinopathy. Conclusion: MfERG was shown to be a very sensitive test in detecting early retinal toxicity and should be used for the screening of patients receiving HCQ treatment. Although less sensitive, laser flare-cell photometry can provide further information to evaluate early toxic retinal cell damage.

40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} effect of a topical non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug as an alternative to topical steroids for postoperative control of inflammation in cataract surgery. Methods: The effect of diclofenac sodium 0. 1 &#x 0025; following cataract surgery was studied and compared to routine corticosteroid, dexamethasone phosphate 1 &#x 0025; in a prospective, double-blind randomized study. Both groups were similar in baseline parameters. Postoperative inflammatory response, intraocular pressure and best-corrected visual acuity following standard extracapsular cataract extraction were assessed in both groups in the initial 21 days and the severity of these parameters was graded. The severity of postoperative inflammatory response to the two drugs was graded at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days. Intraocular pressure and visual acuity at baseline and endpoint were compared and statistically analyzed. Results: The two groups did not differ statistically in treatment effect for any of the variables including <b>aqueous</b> cells, <b>flare,</b> ciliary congestion, Descemet&#x 2032;s folds, visual acuity and intraocular pressure (p&#x 0026;lt; 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Postoperative {{inflammation}} {{continues to}} be a cause of patient discomfort, delayed recovery, and in some cases, suboptimal visual results. Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroid are commonly used in the management and prevention of noninfectious ocular inflammation following cataract surgery. Aims: The aim was to study the safety and efficacy of various NSAIDs drops for control of postoperative inflammation following cataract surgery and compare with steroid eye drops in a patient following cataract surgery. Subjects and Methods: Totally, 200 patients undergoing phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation were randomly assigned to receive either nepafenac 0. 1 % 3 times daily, bromfenac 0. 09 % twice daily, ketorolac 0. 5 % 4 times daily for 1 month or 1 % prednisolone eye drops as their postoperative anti-inflammatory medication with 50 cases in each group. The patients were examined at the 1 st day (baseline), 1 st week, 2 nd week, and 4 th week after surgery. Postoperative inflammation was evaluated subjectively by intraocular pressure, slit-lamp assessment of signs of inflammation, including conjunctival hyperemia, ocular pain, and <b>aqueous</b> cells and <b>flare.</b> Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed by the SPSS program for Windows, version 17. 0. Results and Conclusions: In our study, we found that prednisolone 1 % was more effective in controlling postoperative intraocular inflammation in terms of reducing anterior chamber cells and flare. We found that ketorolac 0. 5 % and nepafenac 0. 1 % were equally effective in controlling postoperative ocular pain and inflammation. All four drugs are effective in controlling post cataract surgery ocular inflammation.

40|$|PurposeTo {{evaluate}} once-daily nepafenac 0. 3 % {{to prevent}} and treat ocular pain and inflammation after cataract surgery. SettingSixty-five centers in the United States and Europe. DesignRandomized double-masked vehicle- and active-controlled phase 3 study. MethodsPatients received nepafenac 0. 3 % once daily, nepafenac 0. 1 % 3 times daily, or their respective vehicles from day − 1 to day 14 after cataract extraction. An additional drop of study drug was administered 30 to 120 minutes preoperatively. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with a cure for inflammation (score of 0 for both <b>aqueous</b> cells and <b>flare)</b> at day  14. ResultsOf randomized patients, 817 received nepafenac 0. 3 %, 819 received nepafenac 0. 1 %, and 200 and 206 received the respective vehicles. Significantly more nepafenac 0. 3 % patients had no inflammation (68. 4 % versus 34. 0 %) and were pain free (91. 0 % versus 49. 7 %) at day 14 than vehicle patients (both P<. 0001). Nepafenac 0. 3 % was noninferior to nepafenac 0. 1 % for inflammation (95 % confidence interval [CI], − 5. 73 % to 3. 17 %) and pain-free rates (95 % CI, − 3. 08 % to 2. 70 %). At all postoperative visits, fewer treatment failures (P≤. 0012) and more clinical successes (P≤. 0264) were observed with nepafenac 0. 3 % versus vehicle. Nepafenac 0. 3 % was well tolerated and had a safety profile {{comparable to that of}} nepafenac 0. 1 %. ConclusionsOnce-daily nepafenac 0. 3 % was noninferior to nepafenac 0. 1 % 3 times daily for prevention and treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery. The safety of nepafenac 0. 3 % was comparable to that of nepafenac 0. 1 %, with the added convenience of once-daily dosing. Financial DisclosureDrs.

40|$|Purpose. To assess {{alterations}} in the blood-aqueous barrier after radial keratotomy (RK), photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), and phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK). Methods. <b>Aqueous</b> <b>flare</b> was evaluated using the Kowa FM 500 laser flare meter {{in a total}} of 87 eyes from 82 patients who underwent refractive surgery. Measurements were obtained preoperatively in 51 eyes of 51 patients who underwent RK or PRK and again at the end of surgery, and at 1 day and 1 week postoperatively. These patients had been randomized (double masked) to receive topical 0. 1 % dexamethasone, polymyxin B (6, 000 U/ml), and 0. 5 % neomycin 4 times a day for 1 week after surgery, or polymyxin B (6, 000 U/ml) and 0. 5 % neomycin for 1 week. <b>Aqueous</b> <b>flare</b> measurements were also obtained before surgery in 36 eyes (31 patients) that underwent LASIK and again at 1 day and 1 and 2 weeks postoperatively. All patients in this group received topical 0. 1 % dexamethasone, polymyxin B (6, 000 U/ml), and 0. 5 % Neomycin 4 times a day for 15 days after surgery. Results. Uneventful RK induced a significant increase in flare immediately after surgery, although this did return to baseline 1 day after surgery (Friedman test). Measurements at 7 days after surgery were similar in steroid-treated and untreated groups. Limbal bleeding, which occurred in 23 % (12 / 51) eyes, did not induce significantly increased flare as compared to uneventful RK. Microperforations, which occurred in 18 % (9 / 51) eyes, did induce significant {{alterations in}} the blood-aqueous barrier that persisted for > 1 day, but measurements returned to preoperative levels by day 7. PRK and LASIK induced substantially increased flare in some eyes. Phototherapeutic keratectomy, in particular, induced an elevation in flare measurements that did not return to normal levels even by 15 days after surgery (Friedman test). Conclusions. Using mean results of laser flare meter evaluation, uneventful RK appears to induce short-lasting elevations in <b>aqueous</b> <b>flare</b> in both steroid-treated and untreated patients. Microperforation induced prominent alterations in flare measurements, although limbal bleeding did not.

40|$|AIM—To {{investigate}} {{change in}} the area of anterior capsular opening (ACO) after cataract surgery and its relation to the degree of postoperative anterior inflammation in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).  METHODS— 31 eyes of 31  patients with DM and 30  eyes of 30  normal controls scheduled to undergo cataract surgery were examined prospectively. The area of ACO was measured with an anterior eye segment analysis system (EAS- 1000) on the day following surgery and 3,  6, and 12  months after surgery. Comparative analyses were made on the area of ACO relative to the presence of DM and diabetic retinopathy (DR). The percentage reduction of area of ACO was calculated from values 1  day and 12  months after surgery, and multiple regression analysis was performed on the presence of DM, patient age, ACO area on the first postoperative day, and <b>aqueous</b> <b>flare</b> intensity 1  day and 12  months after surgery.  RESULTS—The area was significantly smaller in the DM group at 3  (p= 0. 015, Student's t test), 6  (p= 0. 011), and 12  (p= 0. 010) months postoperatively. Patients having DR showed significantly smaller ACO area than the non-DR group 3  (p= 0. 039), 6  (p= 0. 033), and 12  (p= 0. 028) months after surgery.

Methods: Forty patients were included, all of whom had undergone vitrectomy combined with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation for epiretinal membrane. Twenty eyes from 40 patients received topical 2 % dorzolamide three times a day. The patients were followed up for at least 3 months. In this study, we evaluated the effect of dorzolamide on visual acuity, intraocular pressure, central macular thickness, and <b>aqueous</b> <b>flare.</b> Results: Mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) best-corrected visual acuity preoperatively and 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months after surgery was 0. 48 ± 0. 23, 0. 60 ± 0. 16, 0. 40 ± 0. 29, and 0. 24 ± 0. 32, respectively, in the treatment group, and 0. 40 ± 0. 09, 0. 44 ± 0. 12, 0. 32 ± 0. 10, and 0. 16 ± 0. 09, respectively, in the control group. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups. Mean central macular thickness preoperatively and at 2 weeks and 3 months after surgery was 572. 6, 427. 2, and 333. 4 µm, respectively, in the treatment group, and 571. 4, 485. 2, and 388. 4 µm, respectively, in the control group. Mean <b>aqueous</b> <b>flare</b> preoperatively, and 1 month and 3 months after surgery was 8. 6, 34. 2, and 23. 5 photon counts per millisecond (pc/ms), respectively, in the treatment group, and 9. 7, 24. 7, and 23. 4 pc/ms, respectively, in the control group. No statistically significant differences were observed between data from the two groups. However, statistically significant (P < 0. 05) differences in mean central macular thickness at 1 month and mean <b>aqueous</b> <b>flare</b> at 2 weeks after surgery were found between the treatment group (358. 8 µm, 36. 8 pc/ms) and the control group (467. 8 µm, 64. 0 pc/ms). Differences in mean intraocular pressure preoperatively and at 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months after surgery were not statistically significant between the two groups. Intraocular pressure never exceeded 21 mmHg. Conclusion: Topical dorzolamide significantly reduced mean central macular thickness at 1 month and mean <b>aqueous</b> <b>flare</b> at 2 weeks after surgery for epiretinal membrane compared with controls. Although further investigation of more cases and longer follow-up are needed, this study suggests that topical dorzolamide can be efficacious in reducing macular edema in the early phase after vitrectomy via its anti-inflammatory effect.

The results suggest that IL- 1 is involved in the postoperative inflammation that occurs after intraocular lens implantation {{and the use of the}} IL- 1 ra would be valuable for reducing this problem...|$|E
40|$|To {{describe}} cytokines, chemokines {{and growth}} factors profiles in patients undergoing cataract surgery with femtosecond laser pretreatment and investigate {{their relationships with}} the postoperative in vivo inflammation index. Aqueous humor was collected from 22 eyes after femtosecond laser pretreatment and from 22 eyes {{at the beginning of}} routine cataract surgery. The levels of 45 inflammation-related mediators were measured using multiplex fluorescent bead-based immunoassays. Laser flare photometry was measured preoperatively and at 1 day, 7 days and 30 days postoperatively. Compared with the control group, the femtosecond laser treatment group showed significantly higher aqueous humor levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF- 2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF), interleukin (IL) - 1 ra and IL- 18, and significantly lower aqueous humor levels of IL- 9, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) -BB, eotaxin and TNF-β. Postoperative <b>aqueous</b> <b>flare</b> was significantly greater in the manual cataract surgery group at 1 day (p< 0. 001), 7 days (p< 0. 001) and 30 days (p = 0. 002). No correlation was found between the analyzed mediators and the <b>aqueous</b> <b>flare</b> values. The expression profiles of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors and the correlations of these profiles with the in vivo inflammatory indexes for patients undergoing cataract surgery with femtosecond laser pretreatment were identified.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{double-blind}} randomised {{prospective study}} {{was to assess the}} effect of subconjunctival Betnesol (betamethasone sodium phosphate 0. 1 %) on the recovery of the blood aqueous barrier (BAB) following cataract surgery in uncomplicated eyes. Twenty patients [10 male, mean age 71. 4 (SD 12. 7) years] admitted for routine cataract surgery were randomised into two groups. All patients recruited into the study were free of other ocular disease and were not taking any anti-inflammatory medication. Group A received a subconjunctival injection of cefuroxime (125 mg) alone while group B received a subconjunctival injection of both cefuroxime and Betnesol. All surgery was performed by a single surgeon using a standardised surgical technique and all patients received the same postoperative medication. The Kowa laser flare cell meter was used to measure <b>aqueous</b> <b>flare</b> and cells preoperatively and on the first, second, and seventh postoperative day, and at 1 and 3 months following surgery. The code was broken only after all patients had been followed-up for 3 months postoperatively. There {{was no significant difference between}} the two groups in <b>aqueous</b> <b>flare</b> and cells at any of the postoperative visits. In this study we were unable to demonstrate any beneficial effect of subconjunctival betamethasone on damage to and recovery of the BAB following cataract surgery in the uncomplicated eye...|$|E
40|$|Ocular {{hypertension}} (OHT) {{caused by}} inflammation or corticosteroid treatment {{is a common}} complication of uveitis. Ripasudil hydrochloride hydrate (K- 115) is reportedly efficacious for lowering intraocular pressure (IOP). We retrospectively compared the IOP-lowering effect of K- 115 for inflammatory and corticosteroid-induced OHT associated with uveitis. Thirty-six consecutive eyes of 27 patients with uveitis-associated OHT (20 and 16 eyes with inflammation- and corticosteroid-induced OHT, respectively) were treated with K- 115 with or without other anti-glaucoma agents. In the inflammation-induced OHT, mean IOP and <b>aqueous</b> <b>flare</b> significantly decreased (P < 0. 001 and P = 0. 035, respectively), changing from 26. 4 ± 7. 5 mmHg and 28. 1 ± 15. 0 photon counts per millisecond (pc/ms) at the initial assessment to 17. 9 ± 5. 4 mmHg and 17. 1 ± 10. 7 pc/ms at the last visit, respectively. In the corticosteroid-induced OHT, mean IOP significantly decreased (P = 0. 0005), changing from 26. 7 ± 7. 8 mmHg and 18. 7 ± 11. 2 pc/ms to 18. 6 ± 8. 8 mmHg and 22. 6 ± 15. 3 pc/ms, respectively; conversely, <b>aqueous</b> <b>flare</b> remained unchanged. In the inflammation-induced OHT, K- 115 was more efficacious in the eyes with higher IOP. Neither remarkable adverse effects nor exacerbation of uveitis were observed {{in the eyes of}} either group during the observation period. K- 115 decreased IOP in both inflammation- and corticosteroid-induced OHT associated with uveitis and played a synergistic role in reducing ocular inflammation in uveitis treatment...|$|E
40|$|AIM—To {{investigate}} {{the effect on}} intraocular pressure (IOP) and <b>aqueous</b> <b>flare</b> of topical applications of latanoprost and dipivefrin alone or combined.  METHODS— 22 patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were included in a 4  week open label study. Median age was 68  years (range 50 - 79). They were allocated to either 2  weeks' treatment with once daily evening administration of latanoprost monotherapy (50  µg/ml) or twice daily dipivefrin monotherapy (1  mg/ml), followed by 2  weeks' combination therapy with both drugs.  RESULTS—Latanoprost alone reduced IOP from 19. 3  (SD 1. 4) to 14. 8  (0. 9) mm Hg (p< 0. 01). Addition of dipivefrin caused a further reduction to 12. 4  (0. 9) mm Hg (p< 0. 01 compared with latanoprost alone). In the group where the treatment started with dipivefrin IOP was reduced from 22. 3  (1. 2) to 18. 4  (1. 0) mm Hg (p< 0. 01) and with the combination to 14. 9  (0. 9) mm Hg (p< 0. 01). No change in <b>aqueous</b> <b>flare</b> was observed with either drug, alone or in combination. A slight increase in conjunctival hyperaemia was observed when the two drugs were combined.  CONCLUSIONS—Latanoprost and dipivefrin have an additive effect on IOP and no clinically {{significant effect on the}} permeability to proteins of the blood-aqueous barrier. This implies that the two drugs can be a useful combination for the treatment of glaucoma.    Keywords: aqueous flare; intraocular pressure; latanoprost; dipivefri...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} NO {{levels in}} tears and anterior chamber inflammation after phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation with trabeculectomy through different operative incisions. METHODS: Totally 49 patients(50 eyes) with primary acute angle-closure glaucoma and cataract were randomly divided to single-incision group and double-incision group. Both were treated by phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation and trabeculectomy after routine IOP-lowering drugs treatment. Preoperative and postoperative NO levels in tears were compared, and the <b>aqueous</b> <b>flare</b> and cells were examined using a laser flare-cell meter(LFCM). RESULTS: Postoperative tear NO was 9. 86 ± 0. 78 μmol/L in single-incision group,it was 9. 13 ± 0. 67 μmol/L in double-incision group, the differences was statistically significant(t = 3. 57, P t = 2. 02, P CONCLUSION: The early inflammatory injury of double-incision {{was significantly lower}} than that of single-incision. It has the advantages of safety. But the surgical skill should be improved to less the injuries caused by operations...|$|E
30|$|The use of LFCM in the {{evaluation}} of postoperative inflammation following cataract surgery has been described in many studies [18 – 20]. LFCM enables assessment of the degree of inflammation by quantitatively measuring such parameters as white blood cell count and protein concentration in the aqueous humor. This study also included secondary endpoints that were evaluated with LFCM. Aqueous cell counts and <b>aqueous</b> <b>flare</b> values as measured with LFCM were significantly lower in the nepafenac than in the placebo group. The mean flare value in the placebo group reached its peak on day  7 while no postoperative increase in flare values was observed in the nepafenac group. Cell scores and flare scores determined by slit lamp biomicroscopy and flare values and cell counts measured with LFCM showed similar patterns of changes over time from day  3 and thereafter, demonstrating the appropriateness of the efficacy evaluation based on cell scores and flare scores determined by slit lamp biomicroscopy and the efficacy of nepafenac in the management of postoperative inflammation.|$|E
30|$|In Japan, the {{ophthalmic}} preparations {{of steroids}} or NSAIDs {{are used for}} the treatment of postoperative inflammation following cataract surgery. NSAIDs are also used for the prevention of postoperative cystoid macular edema (CME). Diclofenac sodium and bromfenac have been shown to reduce postoperative inflammation [7 – 10]. Some studies have shown that <b>aqueous</b> <b>flare</b> values in the early postoperative period are even lower in those treated with diclofenac sodium than in those treated with steroids [11, 12]. Other studies have demonstrated that NSAIDs are effective in preventing postoperative CME [13 – 16], in which an ophthalmic NSAID was administered for several months after cataract surgery. Nepafenac is a prodrug metabolized into its active form, amfenac. Ex vivo inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by nepafenac/amfenac was significantly greater and of longer duration than diclofenac [2]. And nepafenac had sixfold greater corneal penetration than diclofenac [17]. Amfenac was the more potent COX- 2 inhibitor than bromfenac and ketorolac. And the combined area under the curve of nepafenac and amfenac was higher than the bromfenac and ketorolac [1].|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} dynamic {{changes in the}} anterior segment in patients with acute anterior uveitis (AAU) using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). Acute anterior uveitis was diagnosed in 18 patients according to history and ocular examinations. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was performed and the results at three time-points (within 2 weeks of the uveitis attack, and at 2 - 4 weeks and 6 weeks after it) were analysed. The relationships between clinical manifestations and UBM findings were also evaluated. All investigated AAU patients showed severe ciliary injection, numerous dust keratic precipitates (KPs), <b>aqueous</b> <b>flare</b> and inflammatory cells, and were treated predominantly with corticosteroid and cycloplegic eyedrops. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed {{a large number of}} cells in the anterior and posterior chamber, marked oedema and exudates in and around the iris and ciliary body within 2 weeks of AAU onset. These abnormalities were dramatically improved at 2 - 4 weeks and almost resolved at 6 weeks and thereafter.

40|$|A 3 -year-old Tennessee Walking horse gelding {{presented}} to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals in August of 2007. He was referred to Cornell for multiple incidences of uveitis and suspected ERU. On presentation, abnormalities were restricted to the horse's ocular exam. No significant findings were noted on initial bloodwork. He was positive for Leptospira bratislava. He was initially treated with topical and systemic anti-nflammatories. In October 2007, a recheck examination showed that the patient's ERU had progressed mildly. Leptospira spp. titers at this point revealed a lower, but still positive, titer for L. bratislava. He was maintained topical medications with instructions to return in 1 month.
