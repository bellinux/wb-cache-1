40|$|This study aims to quantitatively {{evaluate}} the rice policy reforms in Japan since 1995. First, I review {{the development of}} the Japanese rice policy reforms since the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture and the transition of the representative indices that measure the level of agricultural protection, such as the producer support estimate (PSE) and the aggregate measure of support (AMS). Next, a quantitative evaluation of the volume of transfers facilitated by the rice policies is carried out by employing the standard framework of welfare analysis. The changes in social welfare are simulated when the ex ante and ex post policies related to rice, namely, direct payment per output, purchase of rice by the government, and <b>acreage</b> <b>control,</b> are abolished and when the import tariff on rice is abolished. In addition, I calculate the average transfer efficiency (ATE) of the rice policies during the analysis period and draw the surplus transformation curve (STC) along with the changes in the <b>acreage</b> <b>control</b> rate. It is concluded that <b>acreage</b> <b>control</b> is the most important policy instrument in the current rice policy mix however, it is highly inefficient and imposes a serious burden on consumers and government expenditure. rice policies, welfare analysis, <b>acreage</b> <b>control...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{analytical}} and numerical general equilibrium models {{to assess the}} efficiency impacts of agricultural policies in a second-best setting with pre-existing distortionary taxes. We analyze production subsidies, production quotas, <b>acreage</b> <b>controls,</b> subsidies for <b>acreage</b> reductions and lump sum transfers to agricultural producers. We find that pre-existing taxes raise the cost of all these policies and by a substantial amount. Under our central estimates this increase in cost is typically at least 100 - 200 percent. Two effects underlie these results. First, raising the rates of distortionary taxes to finance subsidy policies leads to additional efficiency losses. Second, policies that raise (lower) the costs of producing agricultural output lead to a reduction (increase) in the economy-wide level of employment. This implies an efficiency loss (gain) in the labor market, which is distorted by taxes. The latter effect is not incorporated in earlier studies. Consequently, previous studies have significantly overstated the costs of production subsidies and understated the costs of production quotas, <b>acreage</b> <b>controls</b> and subsidies for acreage reductions. ...|$|R

40|$|This report {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} the USDA stabilization program on corn year-end carryover stocks and corn utilization. It also presents data on the cost of the program to the USDA. The objectives of the program were to stabilize corn and other feed grain utilization and prices and to raise the long-run level of those prices. In pursuit of these objectives, a program of non-recourse loans to farmers on corn sealed in cribs on their farms was undertaken, supplemented later by provisions for purchase agreements and loans stored in commercial warehouses. This stabilization program was backed up in some years by <b>acreage</b> <b>control</b> programs designed to reduce corn production. The 2 ̆ 2 total realized cost 2 ̆ 2 of the corn price and production programs to the USDA from 1932 to 1955 was 1. 3 billion.

Most of this cost was incurred in fiscal 1954 and 1955, when storage stocks were larger than in earlier years.

40|$|The US {{government}} has been {{actively involved in the}} production and trade of agricultural products in the world market. Corn as an agricultural product has not been spared. The minimum price for corn has been set above the domestic and world market prices. Such pricing policies have naturally generated surpluses that have been traded in the world market at subsidized prices. At times, the US has used <b>acreage</b> <b>control</b> policy to help reduce the level of excess supply. Price and income subsidies also have been used to complement <b>acreage</b> <b>control</b> policy when surpluses are immense. The empirical results have shown that these interventions have impacted on the world price of corn and subsequently on the foreign exchange earnings of the competing exporting countries. However, the issue of how significant these instabilities have been still remains and is more of a normative issue. The measure of the opportunity costs of these policies has provided an idea of the size of compensation to the competing countries of Argentina and Thailand. The last part of the dissertation investigates on the possible effects of the US policies on the behavior of Argentina and Thailand. The results obtained cannot confirm nor reject the premisses of US policies' harmful impacts. Such inconclusive outcome may be tied back to the inconsistency of the trading policy setting in Argentina and Thailand.

40|$|The steep rate of {{increase}} in yield of grain crops in the United States since the mid- 19502 ̆ 7 s {{has resulted in the}} use of the term 2 ̆ 2 explosion in technology. 2 ̆ 2 Surplus grains piled up to such proportions after the 1960 · harvest that <b>acreage</b> <b>control</b> appeared. to be in order. But despite substantial reductions in acreages after 1960 the increased output per acre has just about compensated for acreage reductions. During this period of rapid increase in output per acre there has been a growing tendency to believe that technology has reduced the influence of weather on grain production so that we no longer need to fear shortages due to unfavorable weather. There is also a popular belief that <b>acreage</b> <b>control</b> fail to achieve the objective of production control, and that public funds are being wasted in storing surplus grains which we don 2 ̆ 7 t need. There is increasing evidence, however, that a period of favorable weather interacted with technology to produce our recent high yields, and that perhaps half of the increase in yield per acre since 1950 has been due to a change to more favorable weather for grain crops. These findings have important implications in continued support for research in production technology and in the way in which we look at our surplus stocks of feed and food grains. If a period of favorable weather has been responsible for half of the increase in yields since 19501 then what can we expect if the weather trend reverses itself for a few years? Do we have periodicity in weather, and have we just passed through a run of favorable years that might be followed by a run of unfavorable years? Should we treat our surplus grains as reserves? How does our rate of growth in grain output compare with the needs of a growing world population?

40|$|Japan’s {{seemingly}} monolithic protectionist farm {{policies were}} often easily moderated by external pressures. This study analyzes {{the change of}} the degree and the methods of protectionist farm policies, focusing on Japan’s most important crop, rice. It calculates consumer surplus, producer surplus and government spending in {{the past fifty years}} and integrates these figures into one diagram utilizing the STC (surplus transformation curve) analysis, developed by Bruce Gardner in 1983. The result of the analyses suggests that external pressures have a considerable impact on domestic protectionist farm policies. For example, in 1986 when the demand by the RMA (Rice Milling Association) in the U. S. that Japan should open its rice market was issued, the STC diagram clearly shows that the level of protection estimated from the international market price diminished. Nevertheless, at that time the level of protection estimated from the domestic equilibrium did not fall. This implies that the government successfully pretended to resist external pressure, but in reality reduced the level of protection, considering the US demands. Furthermore, in 1994 when the Uruguay Round agreement was finalized, the STC diagram also shows that Japan’s acceptance reduced its level of protection. The level of protection estimated from the domestic equilibrium was also reduced at the same time. These two observations suggest that external pressures distinctly affect the degree of protectionist farm policies, while the method of protection depends on domestic political conditions.

40|$|A partial {{equilibrium}} {{framework is}} used to estimate the deadweight loss arising from government intervention in the U. S. rice market {{in order to protect}} domestic producers. The efficiency of the rice program is compared to other grain programs. Deadweight losses relative to taxpayer and consumer costs from rice programs in recent years were only slightly higher compared to the same measure associated with major commodity programs. The primary source of deadweight losses in rice programs result from set-asides. The potential savings from completely decoupling the rice program are estimated to reach $ 387 million for 1987. Key words: <b>acreage</b> <b>control,</b> deadweight loss, decoupling, rice programs. Commodity programs that tie producers ' sup-port to production decisions are becoming a ma-jor issue in designing the programs. Current dis-cussions of planting flexibility and decoupling are examples. The point of these discussions is to move producers away from making produc-tion decisions in response to the program and to facilitate their response to market signals. The goal is to avoid the necessity of using large set-asides to reduce the buildup of excessive stocks, and thereby to increase the efficiency in income transfer from taxpayers and consumers to pro-ducers. The marketing loan provision of the Food Se-curity Act of 1985 reflects market orientation on the demand side of the market by virtually elim-inating government management of stocks. Freezing a payment yield and determining base acreage at the previous five-year-moving aver-age is a limited decoupling on the supply side. In addition, the 50 / 92 underplanting provision of current rice programs further decouples pro-duction decisions from program payments-rice growers who underplant their permitted acreage by planting between 50 % and 92 % of the per-mitted acreage and devote the remaining acre...|$|E

40|$|Interest in {{possibilities}} of forage-grain substitution in the dairy cow ration has been increased by recent agricultural developments. One development is <b>acreage</b> <b>control</b> which allows farmers to grow forage {{as a replacement}} crop for grain. Another is the continuing interest in conservation: Erosion control plans ordinarily require an increased acreage of grasses and legumes and fewer acres of grains and row crops. Both of these developments increase the supply of forages relative to grains and give rise to questions of using forage profitably. One possibility is the substitution of forage for grain in rations of ruminants. The feasibility of this adjustment depends, however, on {{the rate at which}} the various classes of feeds substitute for each other. Recent changes in price structures, with dairy product prices depressed relative to feed and labor costs, also have caused farmers to examine substitution possibilities as a means of lowering costs and increasing profits. Then, too, yearly and geographic differentials in the costs of concentrates relative to forages and to the price of milk give rise to questions of the most profitable ration under particular economic circumstances. To what extent should the grain-forage ration be varied as the price of grain changes relative to the price of forage at particular locations? To what extent should the most profitable ration differ between grain surplus and grain deficit areas or other areas where concentrates are priced at different levels? These questions can be answered only if information is available on substitution ratios. The optimum ration, in terms of profit maximization, can be determined only by relating substitution ratios to price ratios. Finally, determining the nature of the milk production surface with its expression of feed/milk transformation ratios and feed substitution coefficients is a central problem in dairy cow nutrition...|$|E

40|$|Two themes {{stand out}} in this {{extraordinary}} analysis of decline in family farm population on the Northern Great Plains since the 1930 s. One is the organization of farmers and ranchers {{as a reaction to}} economic colonialism and inhospitable natural conditions. Lynwood Oyos properly portrays the Farmers Union as the largest rural organization with a politically liberal disposition in the history of his state. Its leaders, representing as many as 21, 600 members (in 1949), fashioned 2 ̆ 2 a triangle 2 ̆ 2 of functions to include cooperative services, education of members, and lobbying for assistance from both state and national governments. Oyos chronicles the Farmers Union 2 ̆ 7 s negative reactions to spokesmen for the Farm Bureau, who favored no governmental interference in a free market economy, and to members of the American Agriculture Movement, who called for exaggerated governmental regulation and economic guarantees. Between these extremes, Farmers Union members lobbied in favor of price supports while channeling increasing energy into regional cooperative efforts to alleviate economic distress. Oyos reveals that, as a group, Farmers Union members favored isolationism until World War II, then international commitments by the United States government. The Cold War supplied initial rationale for the change, but soon a need for federal involvement in marketing surplus farm and ranch products abroad provided greater incentive. Global marketing fast became an integral component of Farmer Union policy. Oyos makes his greatest contribution to historical literature with a detailed analysis of federal farm policies from the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) of 1933 through the implementation of the Freedom to Farm Act of 1996. Beginning with Franklin Roosevelt and Henry Wallace in the 1930 s, he traces the administration of congressional agricultural policies by presidents and secretaries of agriculture {{to the end of the}} twentieth century. With clear and substantial descriptions he explains parity, price floors, target prices, crop loans, deficiency payments, <b>acreage</b> <b>controls,</b> the Soil Bank, Set Asides, Payments in Kind (PIK), and the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). His text exposes administrative chicanery and instability in federal policies as principal causes for the steady decline of family farming. In the absence of remedial amendments to the Freedom to Farm Act, which is designed to phase out federal support, Oyos predicts continuing deterioration in family farming and corresponding change in rural sociology. Some professional historians might differ with him about scattered facts or interpretations, but all should appreciate his sharp presentation of significant themes in a clear and pleasing style. A remarkable selection of photographs greatly enhances the text. End notes and bibliographical categories provide ample evidence of thoroughgoing research in both primary and secondary sources.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop a viable NDE technique for the inspection of orbiter thermal protection system (TPS) tile bonds. Phase 2, discussed here, concentrated on developing an empirical understanding of the bonded and unbonded vibration signatures of <b>acreage</b> tiles. <b>Controlled</b> experiments in the laboratory have provided useful information on the dynamic response of TPS tiles. It has been shown that several signatures are common to all the pedigree tiles. This degree of consistency in the tile-SIP (strain isolation pad) dynamic response proves that an unbond can be detected for a known tile and establish the basis for extending the analysis capability to arbitrary tiles for which there are no historical data. The field tests of the noncontacting laser acoustic sensor system, conducted at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), investigated the vibrational environment of the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) and its effect on the measurement and analysis techniques being developed. The data collected showed that for orbiter locations, such as the body flap and elevon, the data analysis scheme, and/or the sensor, will require modification to accommodate the ambient motion. Several methods were identified for accomplishing this, and a solution is seen as readily achievable. It was established that the tile response was similar to that observed in the laboratory.

40|$|Thermal {{protection}} systems (TPS) and hot structures {{are required for}} a range of hypersonic vehicles ranging from ballistic reentry to hypersonic cruise vehicles, both within Earth’s atmosphere and non-Earth atmospheres. The focus of this paper is on air breathing hypersonic vehicles in the Earth's atmosphere. This includes single-stage to orbit (SSTO), two-stage to orbit (TSTO) accelerators, access to space vehicles, and hypersonic cruise vehicles. This paper will start out with a brief discussion of aerodynamic heating and thermal management techniques to address the high heating, followed by an overview of TPS for rocket-launched and air-breathing vehicles. The argument is presented that as we move from rocket-based vehicles to air-breathing vehicles, we need {{to move away from the}} “insulated airplane ” approach used on the Space Shuttle Orbiter to a wide range of TPS and hot structure approaches. The primary portion of the paper will discuss issues and design options for CMC TPS and hot structure components, including leading edges, <b>acreage</b> TPS, and <b>control</b> surfaces. The current state-of-the-art will be briefly discussed for some of the components. The two primary technical challenges impacting the use of CMC TPS and hot structures for hypersoni...|$|R
40|$|Commercial lettuce, grown principally in the West, is {{produced}} continuously {{throughout the year}} but in different areas with growing periods of various lengths. These various growing periods are due to different seasonal climatological patterns among producing areas. Weekly lettuce shipments are generally dominated by a few growers or grower-shippers with large <b>acreages.</b> Shippers have <b>control</b> over 85 percent of all lettuce planted for some harvesting periods and 65 percent for others, through coordination arrangements with growers. Due to the perishable (non-storable) nature of lettuce, the amount harvested is the amount shipped to consumption centers. The lettuce subsector appears to behave in a coercive (predatory) manner. This conduct {{is evident in the}} long periods of relatively low prices and the short periods of high lettuce prices experienced in the subsector. Lettuce prices are characterized by wide intraseasonal variation largely because of an increasing overlap of harvest periods among producing areas, production expansion to new areas, and weather conditions. The outcomes are the short-run surpluses or deficits experienced by the subsector. This market instability in turn causes farmer and shipper income instability. The lack of adequate information about lettuce acreage planted each week contributes to additional uncertainty regarding the decision grow-ers and shippers make about lettuce acreage to be planted at a given time in a particular area. Inade-quate information on acres planted, compounded with the uncertainty of weather patterns, becomes a major problem in attempting to decrease th...|$|R

40|$|The 1996 Farm Bill, {{now known}} as the FAIR (Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform) Act of 1996, has been portrayed as {{reforming}} U. S. agricultural policy. Gone are set aside and base <b>acreage</b> <b>controls</b> over farm planting decisions. Gone, too, are deficiency payment programs that provided protection against downward price movements for producers of program commodities. According to conventional wisdom, the FAIR Act provides an environment in which farmers enjoy greater production flexibility, but face much more risk. In fact, careful examination of the FAIR Act innovations leads to the conclusion that no radical changes have been made in food and feed grain agricultural policies, and that {{it is unlikely that the}} FAIR Act will cause large changes in crop acreages. The framework for the agricultural price and income support programs of the 1980 s and 1990 s was established by the 1973 Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act. The key elements for wheat, barley, and rice were target prices and deficiency payments and price supports for each crop through nonrecourse loan programs. In contrast, the FAIR Act creates a much simpler system of transfer payments for food grain and feed grain producers. Nonrecourse loan programs remain, but variable deficiency payments are replaced by fixed market transition payments for the period 1996 to 2002. For each program crop, producers receive payments of 85 percent of their 1996 crop acreage base multiplied by their 1995 program crop yields. Producers can plant any crops (other than fruits and vegetables) on their land (unless it is CRP land). This paper discusses the following aspects of the farm program: Decoupling: Most links at the farm level between current production decisions and current or future deficiency payments were severed by the provisions of the 1985 Act which froze program yields at 1985 levels. The FAIR Act can therefore be viewed as simply completing a decoupling process between deficiency payments and production decisions, by ending the system that actually required farmers to plant program crops on base acres to receive government transfer payments. Elimination of acreage reduction programs: By the 1990 s the role of ARPs in controlling supplies had diminished for wheat and feed grains, partly because of the 1988 and 1989 droughts which reduced inventories, and partly because of higher prices associated with the advent of the CRP and land retirement through the 0 - 92 program. Their abolition in 1996 has therefore had little effect on the farm decision making environment. Production Flexibility: The rules governing base acreage calculations under the 1981 and 1985 farm bills made it costly for producers to switch to nonprogram crops like soybeans. However, these problems were mitigated in the 1990 Act which allowed program crop producers to reallocate up to twenty-five percent of their base acres to other crops. In fact, the planting flexibility provided by the 1990 Act has never been fully utilized by producers. The planting flexibility of the 1996 Act therefore seems unlikely to have significant effects on farmers' planting decisions. Federal Spending: Whether the FAIR Act involves a cut in support for feed and food grain producers is also unclear. Under the Act, wheat and feed grain producers will receive $ 29. 2 billion in market transition payments over the next seven years. Based on current estimates, these payments are likely to be higher than those that would have been made under the 1990 Act provisions because wheat and feed grain prices are forecast to be relatively high over the period 1996 - 1997. Farm Income Variability: Much has also been made of the effects of the FAIR ACT on "the farm safety net. " Yet, in fact, price-based deficiency payments provided little income stability to producers with low yields when prices were high, since in that case deficiency payments were small. In fact,increased planting flexibility may actually provide some degree of income stability to producers by allowing them to respond to shifts in relative prices for different crops. In addition, the 1996 Act provides minimum guarantees for revenue streams through the market transition payment system. As these payments decline over the duration of the Act, they will become less important as a source of income stability. By 2002, Congress will have to readdress farm programs, including food and feed grain policies. Whether the 1996 Act represents the end of large scale farm subsidies therefore remains an open question. One interpretation of the 1996 legislation is that it is providing aid to the farm sector as it moves towards a "new subsidy" environment rather than a "no subsidy" environment. In the interim, although the FAIR Act involves substantive changes in the structure of U. S. agricultural policy, its actual effects on agricultural production seem likely to be small. agricultural policy, 1996 Farm Bill, feed and food grains, Agricultural and Food Policy, Q 1,...|$|R
40|$|Phelipanche ramosa L. Pomel is a root holoparasitic {{weed plant}} of many cultivations, {{particularly}} of tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum L.) crop. In Italy, Phelipanche problem is increasing, both in density and in <b>acreage.</b> The biological <b>control</b> of this parasitic weed {{involves the use}} of living organisms as numerous fungi and bacteria that can infect the parasitic weed, while it may improve the crop growth. This paper deals with the biocontrol with microorganism, including Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and fungal pathogens as Fusarium oxisporum spp. Colonization of crop roots by AM fungi can provide protection of crops against parasitic weeds because of a reduction in their seed germination and attachment, while F. oxisporum, isolated from diseased broomrape tubercles, proved to be highly virulent on P. ramosa. The experimental trial was carried out in open field at Foggia province (Apulia Region, Southern Italy), during the spring-summer season 2016, in order to evaluate the effect of four biological treatments: AM fungi and Fusarium oxisporum applied in the soil alone or combined together, and Rizosum Max® product, compared with the untreated control, to reduce the P. ramosa infestation in processing tomato crop. The principal results to be drawn from this study under field condition, in contrast of those reported previously under laboratory and greenhouse conditions, show that both AM fungi and F. oxisporum do not provide the reduction of the number of emerged shoots of P. ramosa. This can arise probably from the low efficacy seedling of the agent pathogens for the control of this parasite in the field. On the contrary, the Rizosum Max® product, containing AM fungi and some rizophere bacteria combined with several minerals and organic substances, appears to be most effective for the reduction of P. ramosa infestation...|$|R
