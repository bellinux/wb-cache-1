5|$|A {{little further}} on, I found the older and smaller wall, {{which used to}} enclose the pent-up inner prison where nobody was put, except for ceremony. But, whosoever goes into Marshalsea Place, turning out of Angel Court, leading to Bermondsey, will find {{his feet on the}} very paving-stones of the extinct Marshalsea jail; will see its narrow yard to the right and to the left, very little altered if at <b>all,</b> <b>except</b> that the walls were lowered when the place got free; will look upon the rooms in which the debtors lived; and will stand among the {{crowding}} ghosts of many miserable years.|$|E
5|$|Anatomically, spiders {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel. Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae. In <b>all</b> <b>except</b> the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax. Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure.|$|E

Kuznetsova then reached her 2nd Miami Open final of her career. There she beat Carina Witthöft, Caroline Garcia, Serena Williams, Ekaterina Makarova and Timea Bacsinszky, <b>all,</b> <b>except</b> Bacsinszky, in three tight sets.

5|$|Boccaccio {{fills in}} the history before the hostage {{exchange}} as follows. Troilus mocks the lovelorn glances of other men who put their trust in women before falling victim to love himself when he sees Cressida, here a young widow, in the Palladium, the temple of Athena. Troilus keeps his love secret and is made miserable by it. Pandarus, Troilus' best friend and Cressida's cousin in {{this version of the}} story, acts as go-between after persuading Troilus to explain his distress. In accordance with the conventions of courtly love, Troilus' love remains secret from <b>all</b> <b>except</b> Pandarus, until Cassandra eventually divines the reason for Troilus' subsequent distress.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the threat}} of imprisonment, Mysterion unmasks himself, showing the {{television}} viewers only the portion of his face that looks similar to almost all of Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class. The crowd, however, is shocked to learn Mysterion's identity and, much to the regret of <b>all</b> <b>except</b> Coon, who says that he knew who Mysterion was, even calling him out on it at one point (though this helps the audience little as Cartman claimed that practically everyone in his class was Mysterion at times), Mysterion is hauled to prison. With Professor Chaos, General Disarray and Mysterion defeated, Cartman now perceives {{that he is the}} superhero in South Park and that every town should have a Coon like him.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{significant}} easing of the closure policy in 2010, {{the economy of}} Gaza began to see a substantial recovery from anemic levels {{during the height of}} the blockade. The economy of Gaza grew by 8% in the first 11 months of 2010. Economic activity is largely supported by foreign aid donations. There are a number of hotels in Gaza, including the Palestine, Grand Palace, Adam, al-Amal, al-Quds, Cliff, al-Deira and Marna House. <b>All,</b> <b>except</b> the Palestine Hotel, are located along in the coastal Rimal district. The United Nations (UN) has a beach club on the same street. Gaza is not a frequent destination for tourists, and most foreigners who stay in hotels are journalists, aid workers, UN and Red Cross personnel. Upmarket hotels include the al-Quds and the al-Deira Hotel.|$|E
5|$|Having taken {{office in}} 1805, Shaw {{determined}} to re-establish the tradition whereby the Lord Mayor took precedence in public processions within the City of London over <b>all</b> <b>except</b> the reigning monarch, {{and took the}} opportunity of the funeral of Lord Nelson in 1806 to do so. According to one account, Shaw discussed the matter with the Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, who was aware that the Prince Regent would be attending the funeral, but did not seem willing to take action. Shaw then offered to visit the King himself at Windsor Castle to resolve the matter, and Liverpool {{said that he would}} see what could be done. By the following day, the Royal Warrant of Precedence had been granted, and Shaw duly led the procession.|$|E
