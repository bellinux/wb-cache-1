5|$|It {{has been}} a {{struggle}} telling this story over the years, {{because a lot of}} people don't want to hear about this kind of history. People don't relate to it, or just don't want to hear <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>But</b> Mama told me to keep it alive, so I keep telling it... It's a sad story, but it's one I think everyone needs to hear.|$|E

5|$|Growing up {{as part of}} a lucha libre {{family the}} future Espanto Jr. decided he wanted to follow in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather at an early age. In a 2010 interview he recalled how he would be in the front row watching his father wrestle from the time he could walk. In 1996 his father suffered an injury during a match and was briefly clinically dead while in the ring until he was revived. While the injury left a big impression on the then-10 year old he later accepted that it was an accident and tried not to think <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> did comment that his mother still worried about him every time he competed.|$|E

5|$|Von Stroheim's {{original}} edit contained {{two main}} sub-plots that were later cut. The point of these sub-plots was to contrast two possible outcomes of Trina and McTeague's life together. The first depicted {{the lives of}} the junkman Zerkow and Maria Miranda Macapa, the young Mexican woman who collects junk for Zerkow and sold Trina the lottery ticket. Maria often talks about her imaginary solid gold dining set with Zerkow, who becomes obsessed by it. Eventually, believing she has riches hidden away, Zerkow marries her. He often asks <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> she gives a different answer each time he mentions it. Zerkow does not believe her and becomes obsessed with prying the truth from her. He murders her and after having lost his mind, leaps into San Francisco Bay.|$|E

Jerry calls Ray and has lunch with him, while George sits in the next booth and eavesdrops on their conversation. Jerry and George asks him about the statue, but Ray gets offended and leaves when he hears their opinion. Elaine and Rava get into an argument about Jerry's accusation, and Elaine is no longer allowed to edit Rava's book. Without notifying anybody, Kramer dresses up in Irving's old clothes and goes to Ray's apartment, {{pretending to be a}} cop, and recovers the statue, despite Ray's protests. Kramer returns the statue to a grateful George. But while George is holding the statue, Kramer gives him a friendly pat on the back, causing George to drop the statue, which breaks when it hits the floor. The episode ends without ever revealing whether or not Ray had in fact stolen the statue from Jerry's apartment.|$|E

25|$|Which was, you know, {{that was}} cool – {{somebody}} had to get it, I suppose. What happened actually was then I started to ring him up. I thought, here's the guy historically placed to give Lennon–McCartney a good deal at last, 'cos we got signed when we were 21 or something in a back alley in Liverpool. And the deal, it's remained the same, even though we made this company the most famous – hugely successful. So I kept thinking, {{it was time for}} a raise... I did talk to him <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> he kind of blanked me on it. He kept saying, 'That's just business, Paul.' You know. So, I thought, 'Yeah, it is,' and waited for a reply, but we never kind of got to it... It was no big bust-up. We kind of drifted apart after that".|$|E

25|$|Two {{high-profile}} cases {{show how the}} system of traditional courts was manipulated to silence opponents of the Banda government. Perhaps the most flagrant misuse of the Traditional Court system occurred in the trial in 1976 of Albert Muwalo (also known as Albert Muwalo Nqumayo), Secretary General of the Malawi Congress Party and Focus Gwede, Head of the Police Special Branch, {{on a charge of}} attempting to assassinate President Banda. Both these men had been closely associated with highly repressive government policies in the 1970s, but the crime they were accused of involved plotting to overthrow that government. Banda had defined plotting to overthrowing the government as merely speaking aloud <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> there was little evidence that the accused had even done that. The only concrete evidence against the men was their illegal possession of firearms. However, the Traditional Court admitted as evidence three anonymous and unsubstantiated letters that denounced the men, on the basis, “…there is no smoke without fire” and recordings of two telephone conversations about the guns, which did not discuss any plans to use them. In order to establish a motive for the alleged treason, the court considered Muwalo’s possession of photographs of ex-ministers who fled Malawi after the Cabinet Crisis of 1964 and copies of books which the court deemed subversive, although only one was actually banned. The court held that mere possession of the photographs of people who had, “…rebelled against the Malawi government” made the owner a rebel, and owning the books was enough to brand their owner a communist sympathiser. There was even less “evidence” against Gwede, but both men were sentenced to death for treason. Muwalo was hanged, but Gwede received a last minute reprieve and remained in prison until 1993.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the game}} Hershiser {{explained}} why he wanted to win a World Series more than break the scoreless innings streak: [...] "You can break a record or win a Cy Young and go home and celebrate with your wife and friends, but after it's over there's {{only a few people}} that really care <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>But</b> if you win a team thing, you've got 24 guys and all their families, all their friends, a whole city celebrating." ...|$|E
500|$|Gallagher {{reportedly}} {{blasted the}} organisers of the 2008 Glastonbury Festival for scheduling US hip-hop artist Jay-Z as a headliner for the traditionally guitar-driven festival: [...] "If it ain't broke don't fix it. If {{you start to}} break it then people aren't going to go. I'm sorry, but Jay-Z? No chance. Glastonbury {{has a tradition of}} guitar music and even when they throw the odd curve ball in on a Sunday night you go 'Kylie Minogue?' I don't know <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>But</b> I'm not having hip-hop at Glastonbury. It's wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No words <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> sir, <b>but</b> cut his fastenings"--Jaap {{had tied}} the Indian's arms behind him, with a rope, as an easy mode of leading him along. [...] "Do {{you know the}} man's name?" ...|$|R
