40|$|In this paper, a {{wireless}} mid-infrared spectroscopy sensor network {{was designed and}} implemented for carbon dioxide fertilization in a greenhouse environment. A mid-infrared carbon dioxide (CO 2) sensor based on non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) with the functionalities of wireless communication and <b>anti-condensation</b> prevention was realized as the sensor node. Smart transmission power regulation was applied in the wireless sensor network, according to the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), to realize high communication stability and low-power consumption deployment. Besides real-time monitoring, this system also provides a CO 2 control facility for manual and automatic control through a LabVIEW platform. According to simulations and field tests, the implemented sensor node has a satisfying <b>anti-condensation</b> ability and reliable measurement performance on CO 2 concentrations ranging from 30 ppm to 5000 ppm. As an application, based on the Fuzzy proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) algorithm realized on a LabVIEW platform, the CO 2 concentration was regulated to some desired concentrations, such as 800 ppm and 1200 ppm, in 30 min with a controlled fluctuation of <± 35 ppm in an acre of greenhouse...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{proposed}} the novel air-conditioning system which combined induction ventilation and radiant air-conditioning. The indoor terminal device is the radiant induction-unit (RIDU). The RIDU is the induction unit {{combined with the}} pore radiant panel on which the copper pipes with rigid aluminum diffusion fins are installed. The two-stage evaporator chiller with the non-azeotropic mixture refrigerant is utilized in the system to reduce the initial investment in equipment. With the performance test and the steady state heat transfer model based on the theory of radiative heat transfer, {{the relationship between the}} induction ratio of the RIDU and the characteristic of the air supply was studied. Based on this, it is verified that the RIDU has a lower dew-point temperature and better <b>anti-condensation</b> performance than a traditional plate-type radiant panel. The characteristics of the radiation and convection heat transfer of the RIDU were studied. The total heat exchange of the RIDU can be 16. 5 % greater than that of the traditional plate-type radiant terminal...|$|E
30|$|As {{one of the}} {{nanoscale}} architectures, {{copper oxide}} nanostructures offer unique characteristics and advantages. First, Cu {{is one of the}} most commonly used materials in numerous commercial products. Also, Cu oxidation and their nanostructures have been widely studied for a long time. Second, CuO nanostructures are easy to synthesize via cost-effective bottom-up process such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [1], thermal oxidation in air [2 – 4], and hydrothermal methods [5, 6]. For example, various Cu-related oxide nanostructures such as CuO nanowire, Cu 2 O nanotube, Cu 2 O nanoribbon, and CuO plates can be made using a simple oxidation technique [5, 7]. Third, CuO is a chemically stable material as a base for hierarchical structures [8 – 10] or for functionalized structures [11] in various applications [8 – 10, 12]. As the surfaces based on CuO nanostructures also provide extremely high roughness, they are suitable for self-cleaning [8, 9], <b>anti-condensation</b> [11], and anti-corrosion [13] applications. Especially, superamphiphobic surfaces that can repel water as well as low surface tension liquids were investigated using CuO and hydrophobic wax-based hierarchical structures [8, 9].|$|E
40|$|DE 102007025577 A 1 UPAB: 20081217 NOVELTY - A {{titanium}} oxide-containing source with {{a deposition}} rate {{of less than}} 10 nm/s, is used for coating a substrate at a temperature of less than 500 degrees C in an oxygen-containing atmosphere. The coated substrate is then heat treated over an interval of 30 minutes or more at a temperature between 200 degrees C and 1000 degrees C. Deposition takes place at a substrate temperature less than 100 degrees C in an atmosphere containing oxygen at preferably 2 x 10 - 4 mbar. The preferred heat treatment temperature is 600 degrees C. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The oxygen proportion during heat treatment is preferably 27 %. The atmosphere is air and/or the heat treatment is at normal pressure, {{with a duration of}} 1 h. The deposition rate is less than 0. 5 nm/s. The resultant titanium oxide layer thickness is 200 - 300 nm. The substrate is glass, ceramic, metal or a composite of one or more of these. The physical gas phase deposition process (PVD) is used. Sputtering is preferred, using a hollow cathode method. Alternatively a vacuum metallization technique involving thermal vaporization, electron beam vaporization, laser beam vaporization or arc vaporization is used. Heat treatment is at constant temperature. This is reached at a heating rate, exceeding 100 degrees C per minute; the same cooling rate is used subsequently. An inorganic material, V, W, Co, Bi, Nb and/or Mn, is co-vaporized from a separate source. Before titanium oxide coating, a dielectric diffusion barrier layer is deposited, comprising SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, Si 3 N 4 and/or AlN and especially SiO 2. A multiple layer system is deposited. The layer remote from the substrate is 10 nm thick and/or alternating highly-refractive layers including TiO 2 and low-refractivity layers containing SiO 2 are deposited. AN INDEPENDENT CLAIM IS INCLUDED FOR the deposited layer. USE - For vacuum deposition of transparent titanium oxide layers with high levels of photocatalytic activity. The disclosure also lists widely ranging industrial and domestic applications for the layer, including lamps, vehicle glass, building glazing, mirrors, vehicle mirrors, lenses and spectacle lenses. Its functions include photocatalytic air- and/or water cleaning, anti-reflection, <b>anti-condensation,</b> superhydrophilicity, or surface components splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen(all claimed). Further optical component applications are listed. ADVANTAGE - Known commercial vacuum coating plants can be used to deposit a titanium oxide layer of very high photocatalytic activity. This is 100 times more active, than measured in similar prior art. The layers are highly transparent in visible- and near infra-red light, hence optical applications such as filters, lenses, mirrors, sight glasses, and instrument covers can be served. The layers have high hardness, so having high resistance to mechanical wear and scratching...|$|E
