5|$|As {{time went}} on, Louis XVIII {{realised}} that France would never accept {{an attempt to}} return to the Ancien Régime. Accordingly, he created another policy in 1805 with a view toward reclaiming his throne: a declaration that was far more liberal than his former ones. It repudiated his Declaration of Verona, promised to abolish conscription, retain Napoleon I's administrative and judicial system, reduce taxes, eliminate political prisons, <b>and</b> <b>guarantee</b> amnesty to everyone who did not oppose a Bourbon Restoration. The opinions expressed in the declaration were largely those of the Count of Avaray, Louis's closest associate in exile.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 1941, Germany, {{supported}} by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting against them. They were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary. The primary targets of this surprise offensive were the Baltic region, Moscow and Ukraine, {{with the ultimate}} goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line, from the Caspian to the White Seas. Hitler's objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate Communism, generate Lebensraum ("living space") by dispossessing the native population <b>and</b> <b>guarantee</b> access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's remaining rivals.|$|E

40|$|In {{the setting}} of secure multiparty computation, a set of parties wish to compute a joint {{function}} of their private inputs. The computation should preserve security properties such as privacy, correctness, independence of inputs, fairness <b>and</b> <b>guaranteed</b> output delivery. In the case of no honest majority, fairness <b>and</b> <b>guaranteed</b> output delivery cannot always be obtained. Thus, protocols for secure multiparty computation are typically of two disparate types: protocols that assume an honest majority (and achieve all properties including fairness <b>and</b> <b>guaranteed</b> output delivery), <b>and</b> protocols that do not assume an honest majority (and achieve all properties except for fairness <b>and</b> <b>guaranteed</b> output delivery). In addition, in the two-party case, fairness <b>and</b> <b>guaranteed</b> output delivery are equivalent. As a result, the properties of fairness (which means that if corrupted parties receive output then so do the honest parties) <b>and</b> <b>guaranteed</b> output delivery (which means that corrupted parties cannot prevent the honest parties from receiving output in any case) have typically been {{considered to be the}} same. In this paper, we initiate a study of the relation between fairness <b>and</b> <b>guaranteed</b> output delivery in secure multiparty computation. We show that in the multiparty setting these proper-ties are distinct and proceed to study under what conditions fairness implies guaranteed output delivery (the opposite direction always holds). We also show the existence of non-trivial func-tions for which complete fairness is achievable (without an honest majority) but guaranteed output delivery is not, and the existence of non-trivial functions for which complete fairness <b>and</b> <b>guaranteed</b> output delivery are achievable. Our study sheds light on the role of broadcast in fairness <b>and</b> <b>guaranteed</b> output delivery, <b>and</b> shows that these properties should sometimes be considered separately...|$|R

5|$|An {{agreement}} was reached in 1984 between the Grand County Commission and the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) to balance the conflicting public demands to retire and preserve the aging bridge.

Grand County agreed to petition to have the bridge {{be included in the}} National Register of Historic Places, assume maintenance <b>and</b> <b>guarantee</b> the bridge would be preserved. The nomination was approved and the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 12, 1984. In 1988, the replacement bridge was completed, and the title deed to the Dewey Bridge was handed over to the county in 1989. Grand County completed a restoration project in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Cissé {{made his}} return to {{training}} on 20 October 2006, and scored his first goal for Olympique de Marseille on 22 December 2006 when they beat AS Saint-Étienne 2–1. With only four goals in 14 appearances by April, Cissé's performances were drawing such criticism that former player Jean-Pierre Papin urged Cissé's critics to be more patient while the striker recovered from his career-threatening injury. Despite the slow start, Cissé managed to score 4 goals in his final 7 league appearances to finish with 8 goals in 21 league appearances, helping Marseille to finish 2nd in the 2006–07 season <b>and</b> <b>guarantee</b> a Champions League place for the 2007–08 season. On 12 May 2007, he scored 2 goals in the French Cup Final against Sochaux, although Marseille still lost the match 5–4 on penalties, after a 2–2 stalemate after extra time following a late equaliser by another Liverpool player on loan Anthony Le Tallec.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} round of group matches during the 1979 Benson & Hedges Cup, a one-day cricket competition, Somerset County Cricket Club faced Worcestershire County Cricket Club at New Road, Worcester, on 24 May 1979. The result of the match would help to {{determine}} which teams progressed to the quarter-finals of the competition. If Somerset lost the match, and Glamorgan won their match, then Somerset, Worcestershire and Glamorgan would all be level on points, and bowling strike rate would be used as a tie-breaker. Brian Rose, Somerset's captain, realised that if he batted first and declared the innings closed after just one over, it would protect Somerset's strike rate advantage <b>and</b> <b>guarantee</b> them qualification. Somerset scored just one run from their over, and Worcestershire then took ten balls to score the two runs they needed to win. The match was completed in 18 minutes, and consisted of only 16 legal deliveries.|$|E

Results revealed that farmers in investigated regions willing to pay 26. 49 percent more than present costs of providing irrigation water in order to have sufficient <b>and</b> <b>guaranteed</b> irrigation water...|$|R

5|$|Railways reached Lincoln in August 1848, 15 {{years after}} the first proposal. The Wakefield, Lincoln and Boston Railway hoped to build {{railways}} in the area, and negotiated with the proprietors and those of the Fosdyke. Under the arrangement, they would take over both navigations, <b>and</b> <b>guarantee</b> a fixed income for the proprietors. They would then merge with the London and York Railway. Both proposals had been absorbed into the Great Northern Railway (GNR) by the time an Act of Parliament was obtained, but the original agreement was retained, and the GNR leased the Witham for 999 years for a payment of £10,545 per year to the proprietors. This figure represented the average profits for the previous three years, plus five per cent. The railway company also agreed to pay the interest on mortgages amounting to £24,692 which the proprietors held, but had redeemed them by 1857. The railway from Lincoln to Boston ran along the eastern bank of the river, and opened on 17 October 1848.|$|E
