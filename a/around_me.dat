5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone <b>around</b> <b>me</b> said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E

25|$|Merleau-Ponty {{demonstrates}} a corporeity of consciousness {{as much as}} an intentionality of the body, and so stands in contrast with the dualist ontology of mind and body in Descartes, a philosopher to whom Merleau-Ponty continually returned, despite the important differences that separate them. In the Phenomenology of Perception Merleau-Ponty wrote: “Insofar as I have hands, feet; a body, I sustain <b>around</b> <b>me</b> intentions which are not dependent on my decisions and which affect my surroundings in a way that I do not choose” (1962, p.440).|$|E

I really hated how I looked like, how I was... I, Victoria, didn’t exist. It felt like everything {{in my life and}} <b>around</b> <b>me</b> was controlled by others. The one thing I could control was the food I put in me”. She further said that “What happened cost and I was the one who stood for the payments. Now I’m feeling well and with the insights I’ve acquired through this I can hopefully help someone else”.|$|E

[...] Musically, the composition features contrasting moods between the ethereal, ballad-like verses and the more strident choruses.|$|E
