5|$|Agreeing with Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Griffiths also wrote, {{in regards}} to {{legislative}} interpretation, that: The days have long passed when the courts adopted a strict constructionist view of interpretation which required them to adopt the literal meaning of the language. The courts now adopt a purposive approach which seeks {{to give effect to}} the true purpose of legislation and <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> look at much extraneous material that bears upon the background against which the legislation was enacted.|$|E
5|$|Salamanders {{use their}} tails in defence and some <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> {{jettison}} them {{to save their}} lives in {{a process known as}} autotomy. Certain species in the Plethodontidae have a weak zone {{at the base of the}} tail and use this strategy readily. The tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape. Both tails and limbs can be regenerated. Adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so.|$|E
5|$|The South Volcanic Zone has a {{long history}} of eruptions and poses a threat to the {{surrounding}} region. Any volcanic hazard—ranging from minor ashfalls to pyroclastic flows—could pose a significant risk to humans and wildlife. Despite its inactivity, Cerro Azul could again produce a major eruption; if this were to happen, relief efforts would probably be quickly organized. Teams such as the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> effectively evacuate, assist, and rescue people threatened by volcanic eruptions.|$|E

5|$|The {{expedition}} {{to cut down}} the badnjak is the basic activity in the preparation part of the celebration. It can be performed by an individual, but it is usually a collective act accompanied by a festive procession that may include carriages and horsemen. After the tree {{to be used as}} the badnjak is cut down, it is adorned with straw, ribbons, oranges, apples, and sometimes with the Serbian flag. In some parishes more than one badnjak is used in the celebration, and a different tree is felled for each. Often bunches of leaved oak twigs <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> be distributed to the congregation gathered at the church. Each badnjak is festively taken to the church gate, often transported on carriages. The badnjak may be taken into the churchyard without any ceremony, or it may be followed by a procession, {{as is the case in}} parts of Republika Srpska and the Bay of Kotor.|$|E
5|$|The hen flea (Ceratophyllus gallinae) is {{the most}} common flea in their nests. The small, pale house-sparrow flea C. fringillae, is also {{occasionally}} found there and probably arises from the habit of its main host of taking over the nests of other species. This flea does not occur in the US, even on house sparrows. Lice include Menacanthus eurystemus, Brueelia nebulosa and Stumidoecus sturni. Other arthropod parasites include Ixodes ticks and mites such as Analgopsis passerinus, Boydaia stumi, Dermanyssus gallinae, Ornithonyssus bursa, O. sylviarum, Proctophyllodes species, Pteronyssoides truncatus and Trouessartia rosteri. The hen mite D. gallinae is itself preyed upon by the predatory mite Androlaelaps casalis. The presence of this control on numbers of the parasitic species may explain why birds <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> reuse old nests.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda's {{service sector}} {{suffered}} during the late-2000s recession as bank lending, foreign aid projects and investment were reduced. The sector rebounded in 2010, becoming the country's largest sector by economic output and contributing 43.6% of the country's GDP. Key tertiary contributors include banking and finance, wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transport, storage, communication, insurance, real estate, business services and public administration including education and health. Tourism {{is one of}} the fastest-growing economic resources and became the country's leading foreign exchange earner in 2007. In spite of the genocide's legacy, the country is increasingly perceived internationally as a safe destination. The number of tourist arrivals in 2013 was 864,000 people, up from 504,000 in 2010. Revenue from tourism was US$303million in 2014, up from just US$62million in 2000. The largest contributor to this revenue was mountain gorilla tracking, in the Volcanoes National Park; Rwanda is one of only two countries in which mountain gorillas can be visited safely; the gorillas attract thousands of visitors per year, who <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> pay high prices for permits. Other attractions include Nyungwe Forest, home to chimpanzees, Ruwenzori colobus and other primates, the resorts of Lake Kivu, and Akagera, a small savanna reserve in the east of the country.|$|E
