5|$|OXO or Noughts <b>and</b> <b>Crosses</b> is a {{video game}} {{developed}} by A S Douglas in 1952 for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) computer, which simulates a game of noughts <b>and</b> <b>crosses.</b> It {{was one of the}} first games developed in the early history of video games. Douglas programmed the game as part of a thesis on human-computer interaction for the University of Cambridge. The EDSAC {{was one of the first}} stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and had three small cathode ray tube screens to display the state of the memory; Douglas re-purposed one screen to demonstrate portraying other information to the user, such as the state of a noughts <b>and</b> <b>crosses</b> game. After the game served its purpose, it was discarded on the original hardware but later successfully reconstructed. OXO, along with a draughts game by Christopher Strachey completed around the same time, is one of the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen. Under some definitions, it thus may qualify as the first video game, though other definitions exclude it due to its lack of moving or real-time updating graphics.|$|E

40|$|Many {{transportation}} agencies maintain grade as {{an attribute}} in roadway inventory databases; however, {{the information is}} often in an aggregated format. Cross slope is rarely included in large roadway inventories. Accurate methods available to collect grade <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> slope include global positioning systems, traditional surveying, and mobile mapping systems. However, most agencies {{do not have the}} resources to utilize these methods to collect grade <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> slope on a large scale. This report discusses the use of LIDAR to extract roadway grade <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> slope for large-scale inventories. Current data collection methods and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. A pilot study to extract grade <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> slope from a LIDAR data set, including methodology, results, and conclusions, is presented. This report describes the regression methodology used to extract and evaluate the accuracy of grade <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> slope from three dimensional surfaces created from LIDAR data. The use of LIDAR data to extract grade <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> slope on tangent highway segments was evaluated and compared against grade <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> slope collected using an automatic level for 10 test segments along Iowa Highway 1.

30|$|Global {{trend towards}} {{sustainable}} developments have brought natural, renewable biodegradable raw material into the focus, {{but due to}} lack of technical knowhow, {{only a small fraction of}} these non-conventional fibres are harvested and utilized. In this study we have developed parallel laid 100 % banana nonwoven fabric <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> laid banana/polypropylene (60 : 40) nonwoven fabric. Three varieties of banana fibers namely Mahalaxmi, Shrimanti and Graint Naine were used for needle punched non-woven fabric preparations. Analysis of physical properties is carried out in machine direction <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> direction. This paper concludes that cross laid nonwoven fabric show superior tensile properties as compared to parallel laid nonwoven fabric. Shrimanti fibre nonwoven fabric is stronger than Graint Naine and Mahalaxmi fibre nonwoven fabric for both the parallel laid <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> laid structure. Parallel laid Mahalaxmi banana nonwoven fabric <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> laid Graint Naine banana nonwoven fabric gives higher elongation% for machine <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> direction. Increased air permeability of cross laid (60 : 40) banana/polypropylene non-woven fabric observed than parallel laid 100 % banana non-woven fabric. Parallel laid Graint Naine non-woven fabric showed higher air permeability than Shrimanti and Mahalaxmi parallel laid non-woven fabric. Bursting strength of parallel laid nonwoven fabric is higher, both in the machine as well as in cross direction than cross laid nonwoven fabric for three varieties of banana fibres. Shrimanti banana non-woven fabric showed higher bursting strength for parallel laid <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> laid structure than Graint Naine and Mahalaxmi parallel laid <b>and</b> <b>cross</b> laid structure.|$|R
