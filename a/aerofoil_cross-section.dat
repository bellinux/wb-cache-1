40|$|Advanced {{composite}} materials, particularly carbon fibre-reinforced epoxies, {{are used}} {{extensively in the}} construction of contemporary Formula One racing cars because of their high specific stiffness and strength properties. The present Chapter is concerned with one significant load-bearing component, namely the suspension push-rod. These push-rods exist at the four corners of a car and link the monocoque, engine and gearbox casing to a racing track and, as such, they are subject to severe inertial forces and dynamic compressive and flexure forces. The design, manufacture and in-service behaviour of carbon/epoxy push-rods are discussed in the present Chapter. Both uniform and tapered layups of unidirectional and woven cross-ply prepreg have been used to manufacture pushrods of <b>aerofoil</b> <b>cross-sections.</b> These structural components have been loaded to catastrophic failure and the identified damage mechanisms were seen to includefibre micro buckling, fibre kinking and fibre fracture. A comparison has been made between the actual and theoretically predicted failure strains and it is seen that buckling was the ultimate cause of failure in all cases. The ultimate strength of the carbon/epoxy composite material was greater than the compressive strength of the push-rods and consequently, scope exists for improving the performance of the present design of composite push-rods...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the current research {{is to develop a}} Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model to investigate rigid and flexible aerofoil propulsive characteristics when the aerofoil IS subjected to oscillatory flapping motions. The study is also extended to rectangular wings. Flows past the flapping aero foils at moderate Reynolds numbers are simulated using the twodimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The Baldwin-Lomax algebraic turbulence model is incorporated to determine eddy viscosity for higher Reynolds numbers turbulent flow simulations. Flows past flapping wings are simulated using strip theory, which computes the flows in multiple two-dimensional planes located at intervals along the wing span. The flows are assumed locally. two-dimensional and the three-dimensional effects between each section are incorporated via the consideration of vortex lattice effects. The simulations are modelled using piecewise linear finite element approximation method on an unstructured triangular finite element mesh. A dynamic moving mesh is used to compute flexible aerofoils and wings. The mesh is remeshed at each fluid time step using the spring segment analogy method. A novel treatment of the near. -wall viscous grids ensures that the good orthogonal properties are maintained to facilitate the turbulence computations. A wide range of simulations is carried out for an oscillatory heaving NACA 0012 aerofoil. Parametric studies of basic parameters like the amplitude of oscillation, its reduced frequency, and the flow freestream Reynolds numbers effects on aero foil performance are conducted. The influences of the flexural profile on the flexible aerofoil propulsive characteristics are also investigated. The rectangular wing, oflow aspect ratio 4 and NACA 0012 <b>aerofoil</b> <b>cross-sections,</b> is also simulated in oscillatory heaving motion. The chordwise flexural effects of the heaving flexible wing on its propulsive characteristics are studied too. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Summary. [...] A {{simple method}} is {{described}} for calculating the pressure distribution {{on the surface}} of a thick twodimensional aerofoil section, at any incidence, in incompressible potential flow. The method has been proposed by F. Riegels and H. Wittich, Refs. 1 and 2. It is particuIarly suitable for practical applications, since knowledge o_f the section ordinates only is required. This paper gives a complete derivation of the theory including a detailed discussion of the approximations made and their effect on the accuracy of the results. The pressure distributions calculated by the present method are identical withthe exact values for <b>aerofoils</b> of elliptic <b>cross-section,</b> and the numerical values for Joukowsky aerofoils agree well with the exact solutions. Calculations for a typicM practical aerofoil show good agreement with the results from S. Goldstein's method, approximation III, Refs. 3 and 4. The method is extended to sheared wings of infinite span and to the centre-section of swept wings, using tile solution for zero lift from Ref. 16 and the solution for the thin wing with lift from Refs. 10 and 17. K_ [...] 1. I~troduction. [...] The calculation of the pressure distribution over the surface of an aerofoil in inviscid flow is one of the classic problems of fluid motion theory. It has regained importance in the design of swept-wing aircraft. A large number of calculation methods have been devised for two-dimensional aerofoils, and it is now possible to choose a method which is suitable fo...|$|R
5000|$|The L 65 had a single-bay, {{staggered}} biplane configuration and {{was constructed}} of wood with a plywood skin. The wings were braced by interplane I-struts of broad <b>aerofoil</b> <b>cross-section.</b> Two prototypes were built, the first {{powered by a}} 340 kW (450 hp) water-cooled 12-cylinder [...] "broad-arrow" [...] Napier Lion engine; the second had its first flight in 1926 and had a 421 kW (565 hp) version of the Lion. The second prototype underwent evaluation by the Reichswehr to equip the clandestine training school at Lipetsk, but the Heinkel HD 17 was selected instead and no further aircraft were produced.|$|E
50|$|The {{design was}} {{carefully}} evolved {{in response to}} a public competition for museum seating announced by the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology in 2009. Burt has now made over 20 benches utilising a subtly slender <b>aerofoil</b> <b>cross-section</b> matched to end grain blocked ends It is his most extensive museum project to date. The benches suit the galleries of the original building with as much grace and purpose as the modernist extension by Rick Mather, and the ability to tie together the public spaces was {{an important part of the}} commission. There is a new element to three benches commissioned in September 2011 for the Egyptian Galleries (and installed in November) with a subtle change of configuration of the seat to the leg, with its 'flare' as Burt says 'more referentially apposite' to the tenor and the subject of the spaces. These benches are made from Herefordshire oak.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with a}} finite element model for coupled bending-bending-torsion {{vibration}} analysis of a pretwisted Timoshenko beam with varying <b>aerofoil</b> <b>cross-section.</b> The element derived in this paper has two nodes, with seven degrees of freedom at each node. The nodal variables are transverse displacements, cross-section rotations and the shear angles in two planes and torsional displacement. The advantage of the present element is the exclusion of unnecessary derivatives of fundamental nodal variables, which were included to obtain invertable square matrix by other researchers, by choosing proper displacement functions and using relationship between cross-sectional rotation and the shear deformation. Element stiffness and mass matrices are developed from strain and kinetic energy expressions by assigning proper order polynomial expressions for cross-section properties and considering higher order coupling coefficients. The correctness of the present model is confirmed by the experimental results available in the literature. Comparison of the proposed model results {{with those in the}} literature indicates that a faster convergence is obtained. The results presented also provide some insights in the formulation by clearly indicating that higher order coupling terms have considerable influence on the natural frequencies...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper the static bending of pre-twisted {{cantilever}} blading is examined. The blading is pre-twisted linearly about the centroid of its cross-section to a maximum angle of n/ 2 radians and {{is considered to be}} mounted encastr 6 at the root. The behaviour of such blading, particularly when bending under a distributed load, is of considerable practical importance. By the application of variational calculus, static equilibrium equations are derived from expressions for the total potential energy of blades subject to either concentrated or uniformly distributed bending loads. Solution of the equilibrium equations yields expressions for the static deflexions. Over a range of pre-twist angles between 0 and n/ 2 radians deflexions are calculated for blades of (1) narrow rectangular cross-section when subjected to either method of loading, (2) narrow <b>aerofoil</b> <b>cross-section</b> when subjected to a uniformly distributed load. Sets of steel cantilever blades of MITOW rectangular cross-section are loaded laterally at their free ends and the deflexions determined by measurement. The experimental values of deflexion compare reasonably with the relevant calculated ones. Small discrepancies bemeen the two sets of results are not yet fully explained and further investigation of the problem is under consideration. For blades where the pre-twist angles do not exceed 7 r/ 2 radians, the agreement obtained between the two sets of deflexions for the concentrated load system is such that the validity of the theory, when it is applied to other loading systems, can safely be assumed without further recourse to experiment...|$|E
