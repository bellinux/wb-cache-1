25|$|Habit {{formation}} {{is the process}} by which a behavior, through regular repetition, becomes automatic or habitual. This is modelled as an increase in <b>automaticity</b> with number of repetitions up to an asymptote. This process of habit formation can be slow. Lally et al. (2010) found the average time for participants to reach the asymptote of <b>automaticity</b> was 66 days with a range of 18–254 days.|$|E
25|$|The {{conduction}} velocity {{increases in the}} atria, but decreases in the AV node. The effect upon Purkinje fibers and ventricles is negligible. <b>Automaticity</b> is also increased in the atria, AV node, Purkinje fibers, and ventricles.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} digital tools, online or mobile apps, have been {{introduced}} {{that are designed to}} support habit formation. For example, Habitica is a system that uses gamification, implementing strategies found in video games to real life tasks by adding rewards such as experience and gold. A review of such tools, however, suggests most are poorly designed with respect to theory and fail to support the development of <b>automaticity.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Automaticity</b> is {{a measure}} of the {{propensity}} of a fiber to initiate an impulse spontaneously. The product of a hypoxic myocardium can be hyperirritable myocardial cells. These may then act as pacemakers. The ventricles are then being stimulated by more than one pacemaker. Scar and dying tissue is inexcitable, but around these areas usually lies a penumbra of hypoxic tissue that is excitable. Ventricular excitability may generate re-entry ventricular arrhythmia.|$|E
25|$|The injured {{spinal cord}} is an “altered” spinal cord. After a SCI, supraspinal and spinal sources {{of control of}} {{movement}} differ substantially from that which existed prior to the injury, thus resulting in an altered spinal cord. The <b>automaticity</b> of posture and locomotion emerge from the interactions between peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) to work in synergy, each system having intrinsic activation and inhibition patterns that can generate coordinated motor outputs.|$|E
25|$|Fluency: The {{ability to}} read orally with speed, accuracy, and vocal expression. The {{ability to read}} fluently {{is one of several}} {{critical}} factors necessary for reading comprehension. If a reader is not fluent, {{it may be difficult to}} remember what has been read and to relate the ideas expressed in the text to his or her background knowledge. This accuracy and <b>automaticity</b> of reading serves as a bridge between decoding and comprehension.|$|E
25|$|The <b>automaticity</b> model, {{which became}} {{widespread}} following exposition by John Bargh {{and others in}} the 1980s, describes sophisticated processes for executing goals which can be selected and performed over an extended duration without conscious awareness. Some experimental data suggests that the brain begins to consider taking actions before the mind becomes aware of them. This influence of unconscious forces on people's choices naturally bears on philosophical questions free will. John Bargh, Daniel Wegner, and Ellen Langer are some prominent contemporary psychologists who describe free will as an illusion.|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that most cardiac myocardial cells with an associated increased propensity to arrhythmia development have an associated loss of membrane potential. That is, the maximum diastolic potential is less negative and therefore exists closer to the threshold potential. Cellular depolarisation can be due to a raised external concentration of potassium ions K+, a decreased intracellular concentration of sodium ions Na+, increased permeability to Na+, or a decreased permeability to K+. The ionic basic <b>automaticity</b> is the net gain of an intracellular positive charge during diastole in the presence of a voltage-dependent channel activated by potentials negative to 50 to 60mV.|$|E
25|$|Myocardial {{cells are}} exposed to {{different}} environments. Normal cells may be exposed to hyperkalaemia; abnormal cells may be perfused by normal environment. For example, with a healed myocardial infarction, abnormal cells can be exposed to an abnormal environment such as with a myocardial infarction with myocardial ischaemia. In conditions such as myocardial ischaemia, possible mechanism of arrhythmia generation include the resulting decreased internal K+ concentration, the increased external K+ concentration, norepinephrine release and acidosis. When myocardial cell {{are exposed to}} hyperkaliemia, the maximum diastolic potential is depolarized {{as a result of}} the alteration of Ik1 potassium current, whose intensity and direction is strictly dependent on intracellular and extracellular potassium concentrations. With Ik1 suppressed, an hyperpolarizing effect is lost and therefore there can be activation of funny current even in myocardial cells (which is normally suppressed by the hyperpolarizing effect of coexisting potassium currents). This can lead to the instauration of <b>automaticity</b> in ischemic tissue.|$|E
25|$|Motor {{planning}} {{is an important}} component of becoming a fluent semantic compaction user. Icon sequencing should be the initial focus of learning to use semantic compaction devices. A beginner needs to be fluent in a given icon set before progressing to a more advanced level. The Language Acquisition through Motor Planning (LAMP) strategy aids individuals in developing motor plans for sequencing icons for messages. Minspeak relies upon the motor-based learning principles that when motor patterns are repeated, these processes become automatic and simplified. Common automated motor patterns include typing on a keyboard without looking, riding a bicycle, or swallowing food and drink. Increased <b>automaticity</b> and simplification with the production of language allows experienced Minspeak users to delegate cognitive attention to their intended message (language) instead of to the formulation of their message. This allows users to focus on communicating a specific message rather than focus on how to build the message by searching for icons across different pages and or screens. The use of LAMP strategies has been associated with increased natural expression through unique combinations of words in non-verbal children with autism. Ideally, once the system of Minspeak is mastered, productions of communication should take less time and effort across communication contexts.|$|E
25|$|Experts have {{tremendous}} experience through practice and {{education in a}} particular field. Musical experts {{use some of the}} same strategies as do many experts in fields that require large amounts of memorization: chunking, organization and practice. For example, musical experts may organize notes into scales or create a hierarchical retrieval scheme to facilitate retrieval from long term memory. In a case study on an expert pianist, researchers Chaffin & Imreh (2002) found that a retrieval scheme was developed to guarantee that the music was recalled with ease. This expert used auditory and motor memory along with conceptual memory. Together the auditory and motor representations allow for <b>automaticity</b> during performance, whereas the conceptual memory is mainly used to mediate when the piece is getting off track. When studying concert soloists, Chaffin and Logan (2006) reiterate that a hierarchical organization exists in memory, but also take this a step further suggesting that they actually use a mental map of the piece allowing them {{to keep track of the}} progression of the piece. Chaffin and Logan (2006) also demonstrate that there are performance cues that monitor the automatic aspects of performance and adjust them accordingly. They distinguish between basic performance cues, interpretive performance cues, and expressive performance cues. Basic cues monitor technical features, interpretive cues monitor changes made in different aspects of the piece, and expressive cues monitor the feelings of the music. These cues are developed when experts pay attention to a particular aspect during practice.|$|E
2500|$|When {{behaviors}} are repeated in a consistent context, {{there is an}} incremental increase in {{the link between the}} context and the action. This increases the <b>automaticity</b> of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{attention}} given to these response or behaviours primes them for later activation. Another way to explain this process is <b>automaticity.</b> If trait descriptions, for instance [...] "stupid" [...] or [...] "friendly", have been frequently or recently used, these descriptions can be automatically used to interpret someone's behavior. An individual is unaware of this, and this may lead to behavior that {{may not agree with}} their personal beliefs.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} this stage, {{before the}} reader becomes an expert reader, many {{processes}} are starting to become automatic. This increasing <b>automaticity</b> frees up cognitive resources so that the reader can reflect on meaning. [...] With the decoding process almost automatic by this point, the brain learns to integrate more metaphorical, inferential, analogical, background and experiential knowledge with every newly won millisecond. [...] This stage in learning to read often will last until early adulthood.|$|E
2500|$|This theory {{suggests}} that as the brain analyzes information, different and specific pathways are developed for different tasks. [...] Some pathways, such as reading, are stronger than others, therefore, it is {{the strength of the}} pathway and not the speed of the pathway that is important. [...] In addition, <b>automaticity</b> {{is a function of the}} strength of each pathway, hence, when two pathways are activated simultaneously in the Stroop effect, interference occurs between the stronger (word reading) path and the weaker (color naming) path, more specifically when the pathway that leads to the response is the weaker pathway.|$|E
2500|$|This {{theory is}} the most common theory of the Stroop effect. [...] It {{suggests}} that since recognizing colors is not an [...] "automatic process" [...] there is hesitancy to respond; whereas, the brain automatically understands the meaning of words as a result of habitual reading. This idea is {{based on the premise that}} automatic reading does not need controlled attention, but still uses enough attentional resources to reduce the amount of attention accessible for color information processing. [...] Stirling (1979) introduced the concept of response <b>automaticity.</b> He demonstrated that changing the responses from colored words to letters that were not part of the colored words increased reaction time while reducing Stroop interference.|$|E
