5|$|On June 24, 2010, at a press-only Korean event, Blizzard {{announced}} that Korean players {{would be able}} to play StarCraft II for free with an active World of Warcraft subscription. In PC bangs, or other cybercafés, players can play the game by paying 500 to 1500 South Korean won (<b>approx.</b> $.50 to $1.50) per hour. Other options include a 30-day subscription for ₩9900 (<b>approx.</b> $8), a 24 hours play-time ticket for ₩2000 (<b>approx.</b> $1.50), and unlimited access for ₩69,000 (<b>approx.</b> $56). The end-user license agreement (EULA) for StarCraft II differs significantly from those of Blizzard's earlier titles in that buying the game only grants the buyer a license to play, while the game itself remains the property of Blizzard. Any breach of the EULA amounts not only to breach of contract but copyright infringement as well, giving Blizzard greater control over how the game is used. Concerns have been raised by Public Knowledge over how the altered EULA may affect multiplayer tournaments not endorsed by Blizzard.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{became a}} subject of intense news coverage. The origin of the poorly stored radioactive source was traced to KSE, which was charged with possessing radioactive substances without permission and was fined 15,000 baht (<b>approx</b> $450). Environmental Litigation and Advocacy for the Wants (EnLAW), a non-governmental advocacy group, later filed a class action lawsuit against KSE {{on behalf of the}} victims, and also against the OAEP in the Administrative Court. The Administrative Court later ruled in 2003 in favour of the plaintiffs, ordering the OAEP to pay 5,222,301 baht (<b>approx</b> $155,000) as restitution. KSE was ordered by the Civil Court to pay a total of 640,246 baht (<b>approx</b> $19,000).|$|E

According to guidelines published by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MICA), the flag may be reproduced in any size and displayed at all times, {{but it must be}} in its specified proportions and colours. MICA recommends the sizes 915 by 1,370mm (<b>approx.</b> 36 by 54in), 1,220 by 1,830mm (<b>approx.</b> 48 by 72in), and 1,830 by 2,740mm (<b>approx.</b> 72 by 108in).

5|$|Helium is commercially {{available}} in either liquid or gaseous form. As a liquid, {{it can be}} supplied in small insulated containers called dewars which hold as much as 1,000 liters of helium, or in large ISO containers which have nominal capacities as large as 42m3 (around 11,000 U.S. gallons). In gaseous form, small quantities of helium are supplied in high-pressure cylinders holding as much as 8m3 (<b>approx.</b> 282 standard cubic feet), while large quantities of high-pressure gas are supplied in tube trailers which have capacities {{of as much as}} 4,860m3 (<b>approx.</b> 172,000 standard cubic feet).|$|E
5|$|Peasants {{and their}} {{supporters}} advocated the notion that each family was supposed to receive at least four hectares of land; in their system, which made note of differences in local traditional, peasants living in wetlands were to be assigned 16 pogoane (<b>approx.</b> eight hectares), those living in plains 14 (<b>approx.</b> seven hectares), inhabitants of hilly areas 11 (between five and six hectares), while people inhabiting the Southern Carpathian areas were supposed to receive eight pogoane (<b>approx.</b> four hectares). This program was instantly rejected by many landowners, and the negotiations were ended through a decision taken by Heliade Rădulescu, when it was again decided that the ultimate resolution was a prerogative of the future Assembly. The failure to address this most significant of the problems faced by Wallachians contributed to weakening support for the revolutionary cause.|$|E

5|$|By the Late Middle Ages (<b>approx</b> 1300-1550), large battles {{became more}} common, {{probably}} because {{of the success of}} infantry tactics and changes in weaponry. However, because such tactics left the knight unmounted, the role of the war horse also changed. By the 17th century, the medieval charger had become a thing of the past, replaced by lighter, unarmoured horses.|$|E

Nosek's father confirmed that his son had been healthy up until the day of the incident. The Nosek family's representative brought a claim for damages in the amount of CZK 10,000,000 (<b>approx.</b> US$530,000).|$|E

5|$|Even in Turkey {{a system}} of weights similar to the European apothecaries' system {{was used for the}} same purpose. For medical {{purposes}} the tcheky (<b>approx.</b> 320g) was divided in 100 drachms, and the drachm in (16 killos or) 64 grains. This is close to the classical Greek weight system, where a mina (corresponding roughly to a Roman libra) was also divided into 100 drachms.|$|E
5|$|G. Washington Coffee Refining Company was {{purchased}} by American Home Products in 1943, and George Washington retired.

5|$|Metis has an {{irregular}} shape and measures 60×40×34km across, {{which makes it}} the second smallest of the four inner satellites of Jupiter. Therefore, a very rough estimate of its surface area could be placed between 5,800 and 11,600 square kilometers (<b>approx.</b> 8,700). The bulk composition and mass of Metis are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea (~0.86g/cm3), its mass can be estimated as ~3.6×1016kg. This density would imply that it is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10–15%.|$|E
5|$|Spinks {{had moved}} to Chicago by 1896, and was {{perfecting}} his billiard chalk with Hoskins.
