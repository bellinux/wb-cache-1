5|$|Shelley {{uses the}} {{historical}} novel {{to comment on}} gender relations; for example, Valperga is a feminist version of Scott's masculinist genre. Introducing women into the story who {{are not part of}} the historical record, Shelley uses their narratives to question established theological and political institutions. Shelley sets the male protagonist's compulsive greed for conquest in opposition to a female alternative: reason <b>and</b> <b>sensibility.</b> In Perkin Warbeck, Shelley's other historical novel, Lady Gordon stands for the values of friendship, domesticity, and equality. Through her, Shelley offers a feminine alternative to the masculine power politics that destroy the male characters. The novel provides a more inclusive historical narrative to challenge the one which usually relates only masculine events.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{promotes}} subjective experience, {{particularly in}} relation to nature, exploring the connections between the sublime <b>and</b> <b>sensibility.</b> Many of the letters describe the breathtaking scenery of Scandinavia and Wollstonecraft's desire to create an emotional connection to that natural world. In so doing, she gives greater value to the imagination than she had in previous works. As in her previous writings, she champions the liberation and education of women. In a change from her earlier works, however, she illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society, contrasting the imaginative connection to {{the world with a}} commercial and mercenary one, an attitude she associates with Imlay.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Thompson won an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award for Best Actress for {{the period}} drama Howards End.
