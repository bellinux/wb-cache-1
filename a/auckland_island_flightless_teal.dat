40|$|Measurements {{of major}} bones from three island populations (New Zealand mainland, <b>Auckland</b> <b>Islands,</b> Chatham Island) of extinct mergansers {{presently}} known as Mergus australis indicate that birds from Chatham Island differed {{in size and}} proportion from those at <b>Auckland</b> <b>Islands.</b> The Chatham Island specimens were smaller overall, with a shorter skull, relatively shorter premaxilla, smaller sternum and keel, relatively shorter wing bones and a narrower pelvis. These differences support its taxonomic recognition as the new species, Mergus milleneri, described in this paper. Determining reliably {{the magnitude of the}} size differences of major bones between mergansers from mainland New Zealand and <b>Auckland</b> <b>Islands</b> or Chatham Island was not possible due to inadequate samples of these sexually dimorphic taxa. However, mainland mergansers may also have been smaller than <b>Auckland</b> <b>Islands</b> birds. Based on these measurements, Holocene fossils of mergansers on New Zealand’s mainland therefore are considered to be Mergus sp. indeterminate and we recommend that Mergus australis henceforth be called the <b>Auckland</b> <b>Islands</b> Merganser...|$|R
