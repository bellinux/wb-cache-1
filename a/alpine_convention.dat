50|$|The {{system is}} going to be expanded; one Autobahn is {{currently}} under construction, and one more is planned. The transit traffic across the main chain of the Alps especially by trucks had led to a considerable environmental load to the fragile Alpine ecosystem.

50|$|The <b>Alpine</b> <b>Convention</b> is an {{international}} territorial treaty for the sustainable development of the Alps. The objective of the treaty {{is to protect the}} natural environment of the Alps while promoting its development. This Framework Convention involves the European Union and eight states (Austria, Germany, France, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland). Opened to signature in 1991 and consisting of a Framework Convention, various implementation protocols and declarations, it entered into force in 1995, contributing to reinforce the recognition of special qualities and specific characteristics of the Alps, going beyond national boundaries and seeking international action.|$|E
50|$|After World War II, the Alps {{entered a}} new phase. At {{one and the same}} time, {{regional}} identities were reinforced and a common Alpine identity was constructed. A remarkable step was made in 1991 with the signing of the <b>Alpine</b> <b>Convention</b> between all Alpine countries and the European Union. This process was strengthened by the appearance of a new set of cultural values for the Alps. In the nineteenth century, there had been a tension between the romantic advocates of the “sacredness” of the Alpine peaks (such as John Ruskin), and modern mountain climbers (such as Leslie Stephen), who promoted the notion of the Alps as the “playground of Europe.” In the twentieth century, the mountains acquired a clearly positive, iconic, status as places unsullied by undesirable urban influences such as pollution, noise and so on.|$|E
50|$|The honorary title Alpine Town of the Year {{is awarded}} {{annually}} {{by the general}} meeting of the association’s members at the recommendation of a jury. The jury examines the projects and proposals of the candidates {{on the basis of}} ecological, social and economic criteria. Every town in the area covered by the <b>Alpine</b> <b>Convention</b> can apply for the award.The designated Alpine Town of the Year organizes a workshop during which its programme is presented at least six months before the actual Alpine Town Year. During the Alpine Town Year, there will be at least three international events, and two sustainable projects will be realized. The award and the cooperation across linguistic and geographical borders put the participating towns into the limelight, give wide publicity to their efforts for sustainable development and strengthen the links among the participating towns. The Alpine Town Year can also stimulate the realization of projects: the Dobratsch Nature Park in Villach (Austria), for example, is based on the Alpine Town concept.|$|E
40|$|<b>Alpine</b> <b>Convention,</b> {{international}} {{contract for}} {{protection of the}} Alps, represents a framework for sustainable development in the Alps. However, success of this contract depends on implementation on local level, where spatial policies face local interests, and where local communities search innovative projects {{to live and stay}} in the Alps. The article shows best practice examples of implementation of <b>Alpine</b> <b>Convention</b> in Slovenia on local level...|$|E
40|$|The {{signing of}} the Convention on the {{protection}} of the Alps (also called <b>Alpine</b> <b>Convention)</b> by the Alpine States in 1991 heralded new practices and perspectives. This transnational project is intended to solve important social and ecological challenges faced by the Alpine population, i. e. motorized traffic, ageing of the population, national fragmentation of politics, climate change, etc. Convinced that the <b>Alpine</b> <b>Convention</b> should fulfill its potential, some non-governmental organizations and some particularly active persons created several networks of local political actors to connect local representatives, researchers, managers of protected areas and ecological associations. These were designed to realize what the <b>Alpine</b> <b>Convention</b> was promising: a sustainable pan-Alpine region. This thesis endeavours to understand how and why local political actors, organized in pan-Alpine networks, chose to take mountain regions in general, and the Alps in particular, as the shared frame of reference for their involvement. It explores if and how a pan-Alpine identity detached from and/or combined with the more "traditional" national identities is developing among and enacted by local political actors engaged for the <b>Alpine</b> <b>Convention.</b> It also analyzes the nature and socio-political significance of local political actors' involvement in the newly constituted pan-Alpine networks...|$|E
