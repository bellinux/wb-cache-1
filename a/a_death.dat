50|$|A {{springing}} {{executory interest}} cuts short the grantor's own interest, {{in favor of}} the grantee.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>death</b> {{certificate}} {{discovered in}} 2009 shows that Beato {{was born in}} Venice in 1832 and died on 29 January 1909 in Florence.

It is likely that early in his life Beato and his family moved to Corfu, at the time part of the British protectorate of the Ionian Islands, and so Beato was a British subject.|$|E

40|$|No law in any {{jurisdiction}} {{that permits}} physician assisted dying offers individuals <b>a</b> medically assisted <b>death</b> {{without the need}} to comply with certain criteria.

Some individuals with an enduring desire to die who do not meet the ‘due care’ criteria under the Dutch legislation turn to other means of achieving <b>a</b> self-appointed <b>death.</b> This paper explores two alternative methods of securing <b>a</b> self-determined <b>death</b> (<b>an</b> assisted <b>death</b> involving lay assistors or <b>a</b> self-hastened <b>death</b> by stopping eating and drinking), and raises the question of how far the law should recognise autonomy in the context of physician assisted death...|$|R
