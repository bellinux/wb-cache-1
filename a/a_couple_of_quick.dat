25|$|However, {{the quick}} scoring {{and the first}} Test result led many {{people to believe that}} Australia would come back with a vengeance {{on the second day of}} the matcht. Instead, Steve Harmison bowled a maiden over first up to Justin Langer, and Matthew Hayden holed out to Harmison's new-ball partner Matthew Hoggard for a golden duck – the first of Hayden's career. The {{dismissal}} was to set the tone of the innings. Although Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer hit runs just as quickly as England had done, the umpire's finger went up twice more before lunch – Ponting swept to the opposing captain Vaughan for 61, and Damien Martyn was run out taking a risky single for 20. Once again, Vaughan was in the action, hitting the stumps with a throw from mid off. Langer and Michael Clarke continued after lunch in the same vein, but again, <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>quick</b> wickets – Clarke edging a quicker ball from Ashley Giles behind and Simon Katich falling in the same way to Andrew Flintoff swung it England's way. At 208 for 5, the Australians were struggling, but another good partnership between Langer and Gilchrist saw them to tea with no further loss.|$|E
2500|$|When England {{arrived in}} Australia Ray Illingworth boasted {{of his new}} ball fast bowlers [...] "The Derbyshire Demon" [...] Alan Ward and [...] "The Abominable Snow Man" [...] John Snow. The [...] tall Ward was 'tall, lean, raw boned youngster with a fine pair of {{shoulders}} and powerful, rhythmical side-on action' compared to Frank Tyson, but suffered from assorted injuries and never made the expected impact in Test cricket. Instead he returned to England and the young Bob Willis was flown out to Australia as his replacement, though few people realised that this tall, gangling bowler with the chest on action would be England's fast bowling spearhead for the next 14 years. John Augustine Snow dominated the series with 31 wickets (22.83). Although {{the son of a}} country vicar who published two volumes of poetry, Snow revelled in his reputation as a big, fast bowler and emerged as Fred Trueman's successor in 1967-68 when he took a record 27 wickets (18.66) in the West Indies. He usually bowled within himself at fast-medium, but sent down <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>quick</b> balls every over as he varied his pace and Australia had no real answer to his fast, short pitched bowling. Snow had a reputation for being mercurial - he took only 7 wickets (71.57) in the state matches - strong-willed and difficult to handle, and his autobiography was suitably entitled Cricket Rebel. Keith Fletcher said [...] "In 1970/71 John Snow was at his peak, obtaining pace and movement off the seam and troubling all the upper-order batsmen". Ken Shuttleworth and Peter Lever provided good support to the two quick bowlers, Lever took 7/83 against the Rest of the World at the Oval, and Shuttleworth 5/47 in the First Test at Brisbane, but neither held down a regular Test place. Basil d'Oliveira helped with his tidy medium pace swing bowling and occasional off-spin. Illingworth himself was an off-spinner of nagging accuracy who contained batsmen rather than took wickets, conceding only 1.91 runs an over in Tests. If [...] "Illy" [...] was proof that spin bowlers mature slowly his partner Derek Underwood was a first class bowler from his teens and he would take his 100th Test wicket and 1,000th First Class wicket on the tour aged only 25. He bowled immaculate slow-medium spinners and used to say that bowling was a [...] "low mentality profession: plug away, line and length, until there's a mistake" [...] as sooner or later every batsmen would make a mistake. On damp English wickets he earned the nickname [...] "Deadly" [...] for his ability to make the ball leap and turn, as when he took 7/50 against Australia at The Oval in 1968 to win the match and square the series with five minutes to spare. The reserve spinner Don Wilson was Illingworth's old Yorkshire [...] "spin twin", but he and Underwood kept him out of the England team, like the other two he was an accurate bowler rather than a wicket-taker.|$|E

To feed his hungry sister Shankar steals a bread {{from a nearby}} tea stall, at the same there is another orphan ( [...] Kalyan Chakravarthy) boy who is also hungry looking at them, Shankar gives him a piece of bread. Shankar takes up the responsibility of raising his younger sister and also the orphan. Shankar does everything possible to earn bread and butter for them, and slowly he transforms from a small-time thief to a small-time gang leader. During this time he helps a village near by, who treats him like god. Once he bashes up Dada's (Kaikala Satyanarayana) men, an impressed Dada offers him {{to work for him}}.

Apart from crime Shankar is also a good dancer and he teaches dancing too, Radha is a big fan of him. She falls in love with him to sing <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>quick</b> duets. Shankar realizes that Revati is in love with Kalyan Chakravarthy and he does their wedding. Kalyan Chakravarthy becomes a police officer with the help of Shankar, in one of the crimes he gets some info regarding Dada's involvement. Kalyan Chakravarthy asks Shankar's help in eliminating Dada's group without knowing that Shankar is a partner in the same crime syndicate. Then Shankar decides to quit Dada's company and conveys the same to Dada. Dada accepts the proposal but he says that he is not responsible if his brother in law dies in his hands. So Shankar drops the idea of leaving Dada's company, Dada makes him the head of the syndicate. Raghu Varan and Mohan Babu are not happy with this, so they talk another gang to eliminate Shankar and Dada. Meanwhile, Kalyan Chakravarthy and Revathi comes to know that Shankar is criminal, they question him on that front. He tries to explain what scenarios led him to this. But they leave him. Mohan Babu, Raghu Varan and their new gang attacks and kills Dada and villagers whom Shankar helps. Angry Shankar kills all goons and surrenders himself to his brother in law. This film did not do very well but had good collections due to chiranjevi's prowess action and energetic dance, this is the only movie in the combination Chiranjeevi and Dasari. Dances and songs are very good and were captured very well. Top among them are Jivvumani konda gali and Padaharella vayasu padi padi leche mansu.|$|E
