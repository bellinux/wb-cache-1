Let's try to work on one song and take it from there -- not spend too much time thinking about the legend, and do something that just makes sense. [...] We did one song and another song, and we were having fun making music. And actually it was a very privileged time. She wasn't under any kind of pressure, she had time to spend on it; {{it was the only thing}} she had to work on.|$|E
500|$|I am in Lewisburg. I am calm, certain in my thoughts, {{and doing}} {{mathematics}} {{most of the}} time. I am kind of [...] "above things," [...] fully aware of what is up. Do not {{worry too much about}} me, though anything might happen. I know, Pete, that you are strong and decent. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that you should not visit me here. I do not know. With the world in turmoil I now feel that a boy your age should experience what is coming his way – fully digest it without getting a [...] "belly ache," [...] so to speak, nor getting off the right track of truth, fact, honesty, fair play, and being above board–never a sneak....|$|E
500|$|Lauren {{is portrayed}} by actress Ashley Fink. She made routine guest {{appearances}} throughout the first season, {{and became a}} member of the McKinley High glee club in the episode [...] "Special Education". Upon receiving the script in which Lauren joins the club, Fink initially reacted with disbelief. She commented, [...] "I didn't quite believe it <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I was getting Punk'd." [...] She said that being cast in Glee makes her feel like [...] "the luckiest girl in the world". Fink's favorite element of Glee is how series creator Ryan Murphy manages to take the underdogs and make them shine. She said, [...] "In life, there's so much diversity, and it's not necessarily represented on television. I think Glee is one of the few shows that actually displays the diversity and it’s just so inspirational." [...] When asked about her casting process, Fink said: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thanks, dear. But we had {{arranged}} {{for people to come}} <b>at</b> <b>first</b> whom <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you would not specially care to meet. Sir Orlando and Mr. Rattler will be there with their wives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, monsieur," [...] Louise said; [...] "I have a boy's {{suit for}} Mademoiselle Virginie. She {{did not like}} it <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that if mademoiselle went with you it would be strange to have three girls journeying under the charge of one young man." ...|$|R
500|$|Although by {{the early}} 1960s Levin was {{becoming}} a well-known name, his was not yet a well-known face. Meeting him in London the publisher Rupert Hart-Davis did not immediately recognise him: [...] "He looks about sixteen, and <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he was someone’s little boy brought along to see the fun – very Jewish, with wavy fairish hair, very intelligent and agreeable to talk to". In 1963 Levin was invited to appear regularly on BBC television's new weekly late-night satirical revue, That Was The Week That Was, where he delivered monologues to camera about his pet hates and conducted interviews, appearing as [...] "a tiny figure taking on assorted noisy giants in debate". The programme, which had a short but much-discussed run, was transmitted live; this added to its edginess and impact, but also made it prone to disruption. Levin was twice assaulted on air, once by the husband of an actress whose show Levin had reviewed severely, and once by a woman astrologer who squirted him with water.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for The Emancipation of Mimi (2005), Jozen Cummings from PopMatters {{described}} the song's production and instrumentation: [...] "The track is vintage Neptunes with big drums and intergalactic sound effects, and Carey {{adds to the}} breezy, easygoing feel of the song with a voice that is sexy, but subtle, like a shy woman who doesn’t need to {{say anything at all}} to get a man’s attention." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Say Somethin'" [...] recalls an encounter in which a male expresses interest in having a sexual affair in a bathroom with a female, while she agrees and responds [...] "If its worth you're while / Say somethin' good to me". In an interview with Newsweek, Carey described how she felt regarding the song: [...] "You're right. It is a totally different approach for me musically. When I heard it <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was a cool and interesting track, but I didn't know if it was very me." [...] Additionally, Carey outed the lines [...] "Something like volcanic / You and me seems organic / Just like stars and planets" [...] as [...] "nonesense", but claimed she [...] "loved it".|$|E
500|$|Goater's trial {{resulted}} in the offer of a professional contract, {{but he did not}} break into the first team. In 1989, Goater signed for Rotherham United in order to play first team football. At this time, Goater suffered homesickness, finding it difficult to adapt to the English climate: [...] "It took me a good two years to get used to life in England. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> the sun never shone and it wasn't for me." [...] However, he gradually got used to living in England, and over the course of seven seasons at Rotherham he gained a reputation as a reliable lower division striker, scoring 86 goals in 262 appearances, with a winner's medal for the 1996 Auto Windscreens Shield the highlight. A 1992 League Cup tie against Everton gave Goater his first experience of playing against a Premier League team. In the first leg, Goater scored the only goal of the game as Rotherham won 1–0. However, Everton won the return leg 3–0 and Rotherham were eliminated. In 1993, Goater also had a brief loan spell at Notts County, though he made only one appearance for the Nottingham club due to a work permit problem. Towards the end of the 1995–96 season, Goater had a disagreement with Rotherham manager Archie Gemmill, and decided his future lay elsewhere.|$|E
60|$|I did not grasp their mistake <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> “How rude {{of them to}} go on like that, with {{a perfect}} stranger, too!” But before I could call out and reprove them, the {{explanation}} of the matter occurred to me, and I withdrew behind a tree.|$|R
60|$|Time pressed now. The {{regiment}} {{to which}} I was attached had received orders to march. I galloped {{off in search}} of it. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> of making a hurried search for Lancey or the scout, but gave up the idea, well content to have heard that the former was alive.|$|R
60|$|I said yes, and I {{was ashamed}} to own that <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> them {{some sort of}} {{registers}} for tempering the cold in winter; this would have appeared ridiculous in the last degree to my hostess, for the Americans have as yet no conception of publicly modifying the climate, as we do.|$|R
500|$|The Sex {{book had}} {{a range of}} influences—from punk rock to earlier fashion iconoclasts like Guy Bourdin and his surrealism, and Helmut Newton, in its stylized, sado-masochistic look. The book was also {{influenced}} by Robert Mapplethorpe's infamous three-part XYZ portfolio, particularly the X portfolio, with Madonna even having considered the latter as a title during the formative stages of Sex. Photographs from Brassaï's 1933 book Paris de nuit (Paris by Night) also inspired several of the book's series of images. Madonna changed her mind about the title being X, when Spike Lee's film Malcolm X began to be promoted (the film was released {{three weeks after the}} book). She would go on to tell Vogue magazine: [...] "We were gonna call it X [...] but then the whole thing with the Malcolm X movie started. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Fuck it, it's a really good symbol and I thought of it first'. But I realized it might be confusing or look like I was copying Spike [...] Besides, Sex is almost as powerful: it's universal, it doesn't need translation - and it's only two letters more than X." [...] Warner Bros. commented that Sex was very difficult to produce, requiring contributions from many different printing and publishing companies. They also stated that in order to generate any profit, the book would have to sell at least 350,000 copies. Madonna hired top-notch talent {{for the development of the}} book; she counted on the help of friends from the music, film and fashion industry. The singer hired Fabien Baron as the art director, fashion photographer Steven Meisel, editor Glenn O'Brien, make-up artist Francois Nars and hairstylist Paul Cavaco. Madonna originally wanted the book to be of an oval shape in order to simulate a condom but the printing and manufacturing of such a book would have been too expensive. Meisel would later comment: [...] "Madonna and I can keep up with each other" [...] and that [...] "I'm doing things to make people think too. It's not really to antagonize or to push people's buttons. It's really to present another way of seeing things." ...|$|E
2500|$|TLC aired {{the last}} episodes of What Not to Wear in Fall 2013. TLC general manager Amy Winter stated, [...] "After 10 {{incredible}} seasons, {{we felt that}} it was the right time to end the series." [...] Stacy London said, [...] "This show changed me and the trajectory of my life... I've learned so much from all of our contributors [...] over the years. I hope we touched them as much as they touched me. I hope we touched our viewers... I will always cherish the time I spent on 'WNTW' and be eternally grateful to TLC for a great co-host, amazing crew and an awesome program." [...] Clinton Kelly said, [...] "When I got the job, I told everyone I knew that we’d probably do 10 episodes, get canceled and I’d go crawling back to my old job in magazine publishing. So, I’m more surprised than anyone that we’ve lasted this long. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> the essence of the show was making snarky remarks about people’s outfits, but as it turns out, 'WNTW' is about taking stock of who you are and communicating that non-verbally {{to the rest of the}} world. That’s incredibly empowering." ...|$|E

But there's wheah the point comes in. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> only <b>thought</b> of how we could {{circumvent}} yah. I treated yah as the enemy. Now, it's all the othah way. Miss Cayley, you're the cleverest woman I evah met in this world; you extort my admiration.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Picture: The trout] Then a pause ensued in the conversation, {{during which}} our eyes wandered round the room. They finally rested upon a dusty old glass-case, fixed very high {{up above the}} chimney-piece, and {{containing}} a trout. It rather fascinated me, that trout; {{it was such a}} monstrous fish. In fact, <b>at</b> <b>first</b> glance, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was a cod.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so. They {{undoubtedly}} {{showed that}} the affair was much deeper than was <b>at</b> <b>first</b> conjectured. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> the matter over, and I {{came to the conclusion}} that I must approach the case from another aspect. But really, Watson, I am keeping you up, and I might just as well tell you all this on our way to Aldershot to-morrow." ...|$|R

60|$|MRS HUSHABYE. I'm {{beginning}} to like you a little. I perfectly loathed you <b>at</b> <b>first.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{you the most}} odious, self-satisfied, boresome elderly prig I ever met.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{shy about}} it <b>at</b> <b>first....</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> perhaps {{the war would}} be over before it was {{necessary}} to discuss anything.... Didn't want to go into it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Weel, my lord," [...] said Richie, [...] "I did {{not tell}} you his name and quality <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you would be affronted at the like of him having to do in your lordship's affairs. But mony a man climbs up in Court by waur help. It was just Laurie Linklater, one of the yeomen of the kitchen, that was my father's {{apprentice}} lang syne." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{lived here}} all together, my mother-in-law, at my entreaty, {{continuing}} in the house, {{for she was}} too kind a mother to be parted with; my husband likewise continued the same as <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> myself the happiest creature alive, when an odd and surprising event {{put an end to}} all that felicity in a moment, and rendered my condition the most uncomfortable, if not the most miserable, in the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have spoken}} to her about it," [...] she said, [...] "and {{although}} she blazed up <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> so that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> should be burned alive, I made her understand just how matters really are, and she has agreed to let you stay here as a boarder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I {{would do}} so, {{but he looked}} so down-and-out that I didn't {{have the heart to}} say {{anything}} and perhaps make him feel worse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My phantom-life {{was soon}} begun: When I was barely six, I {{went out with}} an older one - And just <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it fun, And {{learned a lot of}} tricks.|$|E

6000|$|So it {{was that}} he evidently saw and that, by his admission, the case, could fairly be put. But what he evidently saw {{appeared}} to come over him, at the same time, as too much for him, so that he fell back suddenly to ground where she was not awaiting him. [...] "The difficulty is, and will always be, that I don't understand them. <b>I</b> didn't <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> should learn to. That was what I hoped, and it appeared then that Fanny Assingham might help me." ...|$|R
40|$|I take my hat {{off to the}} 2 ̆ 7 paper-and-pencil {{practitioner}} 2 ̆ 7 Peter Newby for his clever article 2 ̆ 2 Opera 2 ̆ 7 s Not Over 2 ̆ 7 Til Arepo Returns 2 ̆ 2, which I naturally assume {{was produced}} {{without the aid of}} a computer. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> sight <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he really had beaten computer buffs to the punch.

6000|$|... 'And indeed,' he said, fervently, 'I {{have thought}} and debated much whether it were His will; whether {{it could be}} right, that I, with my poverty and my burthens, should thrust myself into your wealthy and {{sheltered}} life. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you were a poor dependent, I admitted the hope. I saw you spirited, helpful, sensible, and I dared {{to think that you}} were of the stuff that would gladly be independent, and would struggle on and up with me, as I have known so many do in my own country.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{about the}} worst night I can remember," [...] said Whopper. [...] "My! how it did pour <b>at</b> <b>first!</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> sure we'd be washed down into some {{hillside}} torrent and into the lake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Striding {{to and fro}} {{over the}} bridge like mad! <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was old, crazy May Blair. What do you suppose she was doing down there at this hour of the night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; for a moment. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{it quite}} hopeless, but I have unquestionably seen, {{for a single}} moment, the face that I once knew so well. Hush! Let us draw further back. Hush!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, no, you needn't mind. I think I won't {{run that}} journal anymore. It is awful tedious. Do you know--I reckon I'm {{as much as}} four {{thousand}} pages behind hand. I haven't got any France in it <b>at</b> all. <b>First</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I'd leave France out and start fresh. But that wouldn't do, would it? The governor would say, 'Hello, here--didn't see anything in France? That cat wouldn't fight, you know. <b>First</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I'd copy France out of the guide-book, like old Badger in the for'rard cabin, who's writing a book, but there's {{more than three hundred}} pages of it.

5000|$|Speaking {{on writing}} the lyrics, Edgington said: [...] "I was sceptical <b>at</b> <b>first</b> as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{that so many}} other things needed major {{attention}} - such as finding some one who would look after my daughter and be her guardian after I had gone. However I was drawn to the project {{and it turned out to}} be the opening of the door that I sought. Billy Bragg was to give me a creative opportunity and this was to be my path to freedom and hope. Somehow in the process of writing with Billy Bragg I had found the freedom to become whole." ...|$|R
5000|$|On other occasions, Ms. Gross {{spoke of}} her {{interest}} in stillness and silence, titling one work premiered in 2007 as The Pleasure of Stillness, which documentary filmmaker Albert Maysles adopted as the title for his film about her, also completed in 2007. Maysles said, [...] "I was intrigued {{to see how she}} is affected by everyday events, movements and occurrences, which she incorporates in her work. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> sight <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> ‘Where is the dance?’, but I came to admire the intensity and sensitivities that she and her dancers bring to her work. I learned that dance can also be found in stillness." ...|$|R
