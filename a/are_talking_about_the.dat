25|$|The {{constellation}} Virgo is {{a specific}} constellation of stars in the sky, hence the process of forming Virgo cannot be an operational definition, since it is historical and not repeatable. Nevertheless, the process whereby we locate Virgo in the sky is repeatable, so in this way, Virgo is operationally defined. In fact, Virgo can have any number of definitions (although we can never prove that we <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same Virgo), and any number may be operational.|$|E
25|$|In {{the hours}} after Hades and Zelena return to Storybrooke, Zelena {{goes off to}} find the others and leaves the baby with Hades. While she is gone, King Arthur, who just escaped from the jail and is being tracked down by Mary Margaret, Merida and the dwarves, stumbles upon Hades, but he kills Arthur as he sees him as a threat. Zelena finds Regina and Robin Hood and tries to {{convince}} them that Hades has changed his ways. Emma, David and Henry are reunited with Snow and Merida and explain the details of Hades' deception but Emma's vengeance against Hades is making her too emotional. Zelena and Hades <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> others not believing that he changed. Hades gets a weapon, known as the Olympian Crystal (Zeus's thunderbolt), which can kill anybody, even a god. He also suggests that they leave Storybrooke but Zelena is not so sure if she wants to. As Emma, Merida and David find Arthur's body at the Storybrooke Bridge, David tries to calm down a furious Emma, who's trying to protect Storybrooke from Hades' wrath.|$|E

2500|$|I {{think the}} {{decision}} {{will have no}} impact on people's right to privacy, because I don't regard truthful information in court records published by court order in a newspaper to be private information.

In the case of truthful, non-defamatory information obtained legally, I think there is no possibility of any defensible [...] "right" [...] to censor what other people are saying.

Hence one also sees that since the energy is [...] (since we <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> n:th energy eigenstate) the relation [...] does not necessarily hold; here p is the measured momentum (since the energy eigenstate [...] is not a momentum eigenstate, and actually not even a superposition of two momentum eigenstates, as one could imagine from equation (...) above, it has no well-defined momentum before measurement).|$|E
2500|$|Asserting that Cantor gave a non-constructive proof {{can lead}} to {{erroneous}} statements {{about the history of}} mathematics. In A Survey of Modern Algebra, Birkhoff and Mac Lane state: [...] "Cantor's argument for this result [...] was at first rejected by many mathematicians, since it did not exhibit any specific transcendental number." [...] Birkhoff and Mac Lane <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> non-constructive proof. Cantor's proof produces transcendental numbers, and {{there appears to be no}} evidence that his argument was rejected. Even Leopold Kronecker, who had strict views on what is acceptable in mathematics and who could have delayed publication of Cantor's article, did not delay it. In fact, applying Cantor's construction to the sequence of real algebraic numbers produces a limiting process that Kronecker accepted—namely, it determines a number to any required degree of accuracy.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is always}} {{disagreement}} between fishermen and government scientists... Imagine an overfished {{area of the}} sea {{in the shape of}} a hockey field with nets at either end. The few fish left therein would gather around the goals because fish like structured habitats. Scientists would survey the entire field, make lots of unsuccessful hauls, and conclude that it contains few fish. The fishermen would make a beeline to the goals, catch the fish around them, and say the scientists do not know what they <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> <b>The</b> subjective impression the fishermen get is always that there's lots of fish - because they only go to places that still have them... fisheries scientists survey and compare entire areas, not only the productive fishing spots. – Fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly ...|$|E

2500|$|A simpler {{statement}} of the theorem uses graph theory. The set of regions of a map can be represented more abstractly as an undirected graph that has a vertex for each region and an edge for every pair of regions that share a boundary segment. This graph is planar (it {{is important to note}} that we <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> graphs that have some limitations according to the map they are transformed from only): it can be drawn in the plane without crossings by placing each vertex at an arbitrarily chosen location within the region to which it corresponds, and by drawing the edges as curves that lead without crossing within each region from the vertex location to each shared boundary point of the region. Conversely any planar graph can be formed from a map in this way. In graph-theoretic terminology, the four-color theorem states that the vertices of every planar graph can be colored with at most four colors so that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color, or for short, [...] "every planar graph is four-colorable" [...] ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|The last of McManaman's caps came in 2001 when Sven-Göran Eriksson {{utilised}} him for {{his first}} games in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, including a game back at Anfield against Finland – where McManaman set up David Beckham's winner– but then apparently {{left a message on}} McManaman's answering machine to inform him {{that he was not going}} to be in the final World Cup squad in early 2002. Despite the pleas of McManaman's Real Madrid team mates Zidane and Fernando Hierro for McManaman's case, McManaman said he never ever heard from or met Eriksson again. Zidane went on to state England had made a mistake, and described McManaman with a rare passion as one of the highest quality players he ever played with: [...] "I was surprised when McManaman was left out of the last England squad. I couldn't believe they would ignore a player of his quality. Now people <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fact that maybe he will get his chance because David Beckham is injured. But McManaman is far better than just being a replacement for Beckham. McManaman should be in the starting line-up anyway." [...] Support for McManaman also came before the 2002 World Cup in the British media, after Sky Sports published an article based on OPTA statistics, revealing that despite a poor goalscoring record, McManaman had in fact an 88% dribbling completion rate (having embarked on a run every 17 minutes), and an 84% pass completion rate, all three of which were higher by over 15% than any English midfield Premiership player at the time.|$|E

60|$|Suppose that, {{in such an}} {{international}} interlude, an English girl and an American girl <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fiancé of the former, who is coming to call. The English girl will be haughty and aristocratic (on the stage), the American girl will of course have short hair and skirts and will be cynical; Americans being more completely free from cynicism than any people in the world. It is the great glory of Americans {{that they are not}} cynical; for that matter, English aristocrats are hardly ever haughty; they understand the game much better than that. But on the stage, anyhow, the American girl may say, referring to her friend's fiancé, with a cynical wave of the cigarette, 'I suppose he's bound to come and see you.' And at this the blue blood of the Vere de Veres will boil over; the English lady will be deeply wounded and insulted at the suggestion that her lover only comes to see her because he is forced to do so. A staggering stage quarrel will then ensue, and things will go from bad to worse; until the arrival of an Interpreter who can talk both English and American. He stands between the two ladies waving two pocket dictionaries, and explains the error on which the quarrel turns. It is very simple; like the seed of all tragedies. In English 'he is bound to come and see you' means that he is obliged or constrained to come and see you. In American it does not. In American it means that he is bent on coming to see you, that he is irrevocably resolved to do so, and will surmount any obstacle to do it. The two young ladies will then embrace as the curtain falls.|$|E
