5|$|After the {{calendar}} stories, Hebel wrote Biblische Geschichten (Bible stories), {{a new school}} book for evangelical religious education. His criteria were {{that it should be}} clearly written and tell biblical stories in an exciting narrative style aimed at children from ten to fourteen. It took five years to write and was completed and released in 1824. It was used as <b>a</b> <b>textbook</b> until 1855.|$|E
5|$|Morrison co-wrote a {{paper with}} Leonard I. Schiff in 1940 {{in which they}} {{calculated}} the gamma rays emitted {{by the process of}} K-electron capture. Initially at Cornell after the war, Morrison continued working in nuclear physics, collaborating with Bethe on <b>a</b> <b>textbook,</b> Elementary Nuclear Physics (1952), one of the early treatments of the relatively new field.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} experiment {{carried out}} by Wu was the confirmation of the E. M. L. Pryce and John Clive Ward's calculations on the correlation of the quantum polarizations of two photons propagating in opposite directions. This was the first experimental confirmation of quantum results relevant {{to a pair of}} entangled photons as applicable to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. Wu later conducted research into the molecular changes in the deformation of hemoglobins that cause sickle-cell disease. She also did research on magnetism, and on the Mössbauer effect during the 1960s. She wrote <b>a</b> <b>textbook</b> with , Beta Decay, which was published in 1966, and became a standard reference on the subject.|$|E

5|$|Early in his reign, Justinian {{appointed}} the quaestor Tribonian to oversee this task. The {{first draft of}} the Codex Iustinianus, a codification of imperial constitutions from the 2nd century onward, was issued on 7 April 529. (The final version appeared in 534.) It {{was followed by the}} Digesta (or Pandectae), a compilation of older legal texts, in 533, and by the Institutiones, <b>a</b> <b>textbook</b> explaining the principles of law. The Novellae, a collection of new laws issued during Justinian's reign, supplements the Corpus. As opposed {{to the rest of the}} corpus, the Novellae appeared in Greek, the common language of the Eastern Empire.|$|E
5|$|Morgan was {{sometimes}} {{sought to investigate}} public problems on behalf of federal or state governments. She examined the food quality at San Quentin Prison in 1939, and in the 1940s she was the founding chair of the California Nutrition War Committee and served on the Office of Scientific Research and Development. In 1960, Morgan {{was a member of}} a committee that looked at the toxicity of pesticides used in agriculture. She co-authored <b>a</b> <b>textbook,</b> Experimental Food Study, with Irene Sanborn Hall, and she wrote detailed histories of the Alpha Nu and Iota Sigma Pi honor societies.|$|E
5|$|The {{algorithm}} {{was probably}} not discovered by Euclid, who compiled results from earlier mathematicians in his Elements. The mathematician and historian B. L. van der Waerden suggests that Book VII derives from <b>a</b> <b>textbook</b> on number theory written by mathematicians {{in the school of}} Pythagoras. The algorithm was probably known by Eudoxus of Cnidus (about 375 BC). The algorithm may even pre-date Eudoxus, judging from the use of the technical term ἀνθυφαίρεσις (anthyphairesis, reciprocal subtraction) in works by Euclid and Aristotle.|$|E

5|$|Despite his bluster, Kutuzov {{knew from}} dispatches that his army {{had been too}} badly hurt to fight a {{continuing}} action the following day. He {{knew exactly what he}} was doing: by fighting the pitched battle, he could now retreat with the Russian army still intact, lead its recovery, and force the weakened French forces to move even further from their bases of supply. The dénouement became <b>a</b> <b>textbook</b> example of what a hold logistics placed upon an army far from its center of supply. On September8, the Russian army moved away from the battlefield in twin columns to Semolino, allowing Napoleon to occupy Moscow and await for 5 weeks a Russian surrender that would never come.|$|E
5|$|During Modi's {{second term}} {{the rhetoric of}} the {{government}} shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development. Modi curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabad's textile industry, and dropped Gordhan Zadafia (an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet. When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP. Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi's administrative decisions. Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. Modi wrote a forward to <b>a</b> <b>textbook</b> by Dinanath Batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of his}} life, Rimsky-Korsakov {{combined}} his {{composition and}} teaching with {{a career in the}} Russian military—at first as an officer in the Imperial Russian Navy, then as the civilian Inspector of Naval Bands. He wrote that he developed a passion for the ocean in childhood from reading books and hearing of his older brother's exploits in the navy. This love of the sea might have influenced him to write two of his best-known orchestral works, the musical tableau Sadko (not to be confused with his later opera of the same name) and Scheherazade. Through his service as Inspector of Naval Bands, Rimsky-Korsakov expanded his knowledge of woodwind and brass playing, which enhanced his abilities in orchestration. He passed this knowledge to his students, and also posthumously through <b>a</b> <b>textbook</b> on orchestration that was completed by his son-in-law, Maximilian Steinberg.|$|E

5|$|In January 1933, the Nazi Party came {{to power}} in Germany. In May, Born became one of six Jewish professors at Göttingen who were {{suspended}} with pay; Franck had already resigned. In twelve years they had built Göttingen into one of the world's foremost centres for physics. Born began looking for a new job, writing to Maria Göppert-Mayer at Johns Hopkins University and Rudi Ladenburg at Princeton University. Offers soon started to pour in, and he accepted one from St John's College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he wrote a popular science book, The Restless Universe, and <b>a</b> <b>textbook,</b> Atomic Physics, that soon became a standard text, going through seven editions. His family soon settled into life in England, with his daughters Irene and Gritli becoming engaged to Welshman Brinley (Bryn) Newton-John (Olivia Newton-John's parents; Born is Olivia's grandfather and Irene is her mother) and Englishman Maurice Pryce respectively.|$|E
5|$|In October 1830, {{together}} with his uncle Nicolae Rădulescu, he opened the first privately owned printing press in his country, operating on his property at Cişmeaua Mavrogheni, in Obor (the land went {{by the name of}} Câmpul lui Eliad—"Eliad's Field", and housed several other large buildings). Among the first works he published was a collection of poems by Alphonse de Lamartine, translated by Heliade from French, and grouped {{together with}} some of his own poems. Later, he translated <b>a</b> <b>textbook</b> on meter and Louis-Benjamin Francoeur's standard manual of Arithmetics, as well as works by Enlightenment authors—Voltaire's Mahomet, ou le fanatisme, and stories by Jean-François Marmontel. They were followed, in 1839, by a version of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Julie, or the New Heloise.|$|E
5|$|In general, Geographia Neoteriki, {{was welcomed}} with enthusiasm by western {{intellectual}} circles. Jean-Baptiste d'Ansse de Villoison, professor of modern Greek in the Ecole des Langues Orientales Vivantes, used it as <b>a</b> <b>textbook</b> for his students. French geographer Barbie du Bocage published a review after the book's publication along with a translated passage. Moreover, travellers who published accounts during the early 19th century, frequently cited the text. François Pouqueville, William Martin Leake, Henry Holland, and Lord Byron mentioned this work, and {{used it as a}} source of information. The book also enjoyed some popularity in the non Greek regions of the Balkan peninsula, while 19th century Bulgarian authors of geographic textbooks used it as a model.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} modern {{histories}} of the Arab nation {{in contrast to a}} history of an individual Arab country was composed by Darwaza in the late 1920s under the title Lessons of Arab History: From Antiquity to Present Times. In the book, Darwaza begins by describing the origins of the Semitic peoples, the rise of Islam, the end of Arab rule in the Middle East by Turkic groups, and the foreign rule over the Arabs by Western powers. The book was intended to be used as <b>a</b> <b>textbook</b> in primary and secondary schools throughout the British Mandates of Palestine and later Iraq, hence its simplified and direct language. Nonetheless, it played a pioneering {{role in the development of}} pan-Arabism.|$|E
5|$|Piattoli {{arrived in}} the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that year, as a tutor for the sons of Piotr Potocki, {{a member of the}} magnate Potocki family. It was said in a {{contemporary}} account that his entire material wealth at that time was composed of a “sizable library”. Piattoli ended his service with the Potocki family around 1784 due to personal disagreements with Pelagia Potocka and Maria Radziwiłł. In the meantime, he became associated with the Lubomirski family—Izabela Lubomirska in particular—and through them befriended Stanisław Kostka Potocki and Grzegorz Piramowicz. Through Potocki and Piramowicz he {{became a member of the}} Society for Elementary Books in 1784. In the Society he was tasked with writing <b>a</b> <b>textbook</b> on the history of science. Around that time he was also active in Warsaw freemasonry.|$|E
5|$|Sabon is a Garamond revival {{designed}} by Jan Tschichold in 1964, jointly released by Linotype, Monotype and Stempel in 1967. It {{is named after}} Jacques Sabon, a Frankfurt-based printer, who introduced the typefaces of Garamond and his contemporaries to German printing. An unusual feature of many releases of Sabon is that the italic, based on Granjon's work, is wider than most normal italics, at the same width as the roman style. This suited Linotype's hot metal typesetting system. Later Sabon versions, such as Jean François Porchez's Sabon Next, have not always maintained this principle. Porchez and Mosley, as part of Porchez's research into Sabon, suggest that aspects of its design may have been copied from a font by Guillaume Le Bé, a large-size specimen {{of which he had}} previously reproduced in <b>a</b> <b>textbook.</b>|$|E

5|$|Steinitz was {{the main}} chess {{correspondent}} of The Field (in London) from 1873 to 1882, and used this to present his ideas about chess strategy. In 1885 he founded the International Chess Magazine in New York and edited it until 1891. In addition to game commentaries and blow-by-blow accounts of the negotiations leading to his 1886 match with Johann Zukertort and of the American Chess Congress' world championship project, he wrote {{a long series of}} articles about Paul Morphy, who had died in 1884. He wrote the book of the 1889 New York tournament, in which he commented on all of the games 432 of them, and in 1889 he published <b>a</b> <b>textbook,</b> The Modern Chess Instructor.|$|E
5|$|The first astrological book {{published}} in Europe was the Liber Planetis et Mundi Climatibus ("Book of the Planets and Regions of the World"), which appeared between 1010 and 1027 AD, {{and may have}} been authored by Gerbert of Aurillac. Ptolemy's second century AD Tetrabiblos was translated into Latin by Plato of Tivoli in 1138. The Dominican theologian Thomas Aquinas followed Aristotle in proposing that the stars ruled the imperfect 'sublunary' body, while attempting to reconcile astrology with Christianity by stating that God ruled the soul. The thirteenth century mathematician Campanus of Novara is said to have devised a system of astrological houses that divides the prime vertical into 'houses' of equal 30° arcs, though the system was used earlier in the East. The thirteenth century astronomer Guido Bonatti wrote <b>a</b> <b>textbook,</b> the Liber Astronomicus, a copy of which King Henry VII of England owned {{at the end of the}} fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Abovian's poetry {{was filled}} with satire best {{expressed}} in The wine jug, in which he criticized Russian bureaucracy. Leisure entertainment was adapted by Abovian from notes he took in public gatherings. The work {{is a collection of}} fables in verse that chastise vice, injustice and moral degeneration. He wrote scientific and artistic non-fiction works such as the Discovery of America and Book of Stories. Abovian translated to the Armenian language the works of Homer, Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Nikolay Karamzin, I. A. Krylov and others. He continued promoting secular and comprehensive (mental, moral, working, physical) training, school accessibility, free education for the indigent and equal education of boys and girls. Pedagogical compositions of Abovian include the book for reading Introduction to education (1838), <b>a</b> <b>textbook</b> of Russian grammar and an Armenian-language novel History of Tigran, or a moral manual for the Armenian children (printed in 1941). He was the first Armenian to study scientific ethnography: the way of life and customs of the peasants of the native settlements around Kanaker, inhabitants of Yerevan, and gathered and studied Armenian and Kurdish folklore.|$|E
