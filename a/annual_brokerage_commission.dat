40|$|We {{study the}} trading costs {{for a large}} sample of equity mutual funds. Using the actual <b>brokerage</b> <b>commissions</b> paid in 2002 and {{estimating}} the implicit trading costs, we find that fund investors bear substantial portfolio trading costs. Equity funds incur an average <b>annual</b> explicit <b>brokerage</b> <b>commission</b> of 38 basis points and an average annual implicit trading cost of 58 basis points. When measured separately for different mutual fund styles, these costs are highest for small cap funds and lowest for large cap funds. About 46 % of all small cap mutual funds have trading costs that are higher than the annual fees investors pay. We suspect that many mutual fund investors are completely unaware of these trading costs and simply assume that the reported expense ratio includes them. Our findings suggest that greater attention to trading costs might help investors make more informed mutual fund investment decisions and that greater disclosure of trading costs might benefit investors...|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} {{there are}} from $ 10. 4 -$ 13. 3 billion in <b>annual</b> <b>brokerage</b> <b>commissions</b> on office and industrial properties. Our estimate {{is based on}} an underlying imputation of office and industrial sector size that relies on new data that constitutes a census of properties in major markets. This is important because estimation error is reduced the more one can rely on a census for the measure of market size. Previous estimates made before these data became available look to be subject to much greater estimation error. Our analysis concludes that there is over 7 billion square feet of office space nationally and nearly 23 billion square feet of industrial product. In aggregate, we conclude that about $ 185 billion in lease revenues are generated annually on this space. Assuming the midpoint of $ 11. 8 billion from the estimated range of gross commissions, we calculate that the present value of industry profits is in excess of $ 5 billion. This figure clearly is large enough {{to attract the attention of}} entrepreneurs using new information technologies to try to capture a portion of the value in this industry. The next two stages of this research will more carefully examine the nature of e-business operations in the commercial brokerage space and how they might influence the industrial organization of the commercial brokerage industry, the nature of brokerage firms, and compensation to brokers. ...|$|R

Moreover, a higher proportion of <b>brokerage</b> <b>commissions</b> in total revenue are associated with lower production efficiency, implying that securities houses should expand profit-making sources outside their brokerage business. securities business; internet securities brokers; revenue management; frontier productivity function; production efficiency; Japan; small firms; operating revenue; <b>brokerage</b> <b>commissions.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new evidence}} {{on the impact of}} electronic trading on <b>brokerage</b> <b>commissions</b> by investigating a sample period that covers the period of transition from floor to electronic trading on the Sydney Futures Exchange. After controlling for liquidity, volatility and broker identity, the introduction of electronic trading remains to be associated with lower <b>brokerage</b> <b>commissions</b> relative to floor markets. The study also provides new evidence on <b>brokerage</b> <b>commissions</b> in futures markets finding that commission fees charged on futures trades average 0. 002 % of transaction value. This is up to 120 times smaller than the magnitude of brokerage fees charged in stock markets, and considerably lower than the magnitude of brokerage fees assumed for futures markets in previous research. Consistent with existing studies based on stock markets, commissions charged per contract decrease with order size reflecting economies of scale in the provision of brokerage services in futures markets. Commission rates are positively related to bid-ask spreads and price volatility, which proxy for the probability of execution error costs and execution difficulty, respectively. Finally, the identity of the broker is found to be a significant determinant of commissions reflecting different pricing schedules across brokers. 15 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The century-old fixed <b>brokerage</b> <b>commission</b> system ended May 1, 1975. This is {{referred}} to as Mayday. To examine whether mutual funds benefited from the deregulation of <b>brokerage</b> <b>commission</b> rates, a regression model and the cumulative average residuals method are used to analyze the performance of mutual funds before and after Mayday. The analyses are extended to different types of funds to examine differential impacts of deregulation. In addition, the residual returns of mutual funds are compared to those of an unmanaged portfolio of Standard 2 ̆ 6 Poor 2 ̆ 7 s 500 stocks. It is found that mutual funds have benefited only marginally from the commission rate reduction. The returns to mutual fund portfolios have risen only slightly in the post-deregulation period. However, the turnover rates of mutual fund portfolios have risen substantially, which partially offsets the benefit of the commission rate reduction. It is also found that deregulation has benefited growth funds more than income-oriented funds...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present new {{empirical}} evidence on global trends in equity-related transaction costs and trading volume, as well as to highlight recent research in international market microstructure. Design/methodology/approach – Estimates of <b>brokerage</b> <b>commissions,</b> indirect trading costs, and trading volume are obtained from a comprehensive institutional investor database. Quarterly data are used to compute trends in transaction costs and trading volume, as well as shifts in trading between mature and emerging markets. Findings – The results indicate a steady decline in <b>brokerage</b> <b>commissions</b> around the world but indirect trading costs appear to have reached a plateau. The fastest growth in trading volume can be found in the emerging markets of South America but the USA leads the way in terms of the steepest reductions in transaction costs. Research limitations/implications – The paper relies on one source of transaction cost estimates over a relatively short period (March 2005 -December 2007). Originality/value – The paper provides comprehensive and current empirical evidence on important trends in international market microstructure.

40|$|Moore's law {{was first}} {{postulated}} in 1968, and it loosely {{says that the}} cost of making calculations on a computer falls by 50 % each year. Securities markets are, in essence, a form of data processing. Consequently, Moore’s law has driven important changes in those markets over the past forty years. Faster data processing was essential for major changes in securities trading. Increased turnover of portfolios was a result of faster data processing. Consequently, the criticism of that turnover may be misplaced. The effectiveness of regulatory changes, such as the lowering of <b>brokerage</b> <b>commissions</b> and the reduction in bid ask spreads, depended on reduced data processing costs, that is on Moore's Law. Deregulation of <b>brokerage</b> <b>commissions</b> could not have reduced rates by as much as it did if we had not had decreasing costs of data processing. The reduction in bid ask spreads which followed decimalization of securities quotes depended on improved data processing. Continued reductions in data processing costs will require a new regulatory approach. Regulators should consider the improvements in data processing and data transmission when they establish capital requirements and haircuts. ...|$|R
