5|$|The film Casablanca was a {{plot device}} in the science-fiction {{television}} movie Overdrawn <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Memory</b> Bank (1983), based on John Varley's story. It {{was referred to}} in Terry Gilliam's dystopian Brazil (1985). Warner Bros. produced its own parody in the homage Carrotblanca, a 1995 Bugs Bunny cartoon. In Casablanca, a novella by Argentine writer Edgar Brau, the protagonist somehow wanders into Rick's Café Américain and listens to a strange tale related by Sam. The 2016 musical film La La Land contains multiple allusions to Casablanca in the imagery, dialogue, and plot.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, Juliá played Calibanos in Mazursky's Tempest and Ray in {{the musical}} One from the Heart. In 1983, his first son with Poloway, Raúl Sigmund Juliá was born. That year he also starred in the public {{television}} film Overdrawn <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Memory</b> Bank, which received a weak reception and was satirized on Mystery Science Theater 3000. After not appearing in a film for two years, Juliá played a political prisoner named Valentín in an adaptation of Manuel Puig's Kiss of the Spider Woman. Considering that the script was unique, he agreed to begin filming before receiving his salary and traveled to South America, where he interviewed rebels and ex-prisoners to familiarize himself with their experiences and ideology. Upon its release, the film was a commercial success. For his performance, Juliá received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award and won the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures' award for best actor along with co-lead actor William Hurt.|$|E
