40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} novel system for {{monitoring}} {{the health of}} underground pipelines. Some of these pipelines transport dangerous contents and any damage incurred might have catastrophic consequences. However, most of these damage are unintentional and usually a result of surrounding construction activities. In order to prevent these potential damages, monitoring systems are indispensable. This paper focuses on acoustically recognizing road cutters since they prelude most construction activities in modern cities. Acoustic recognition can be easily achieved by installing a distributed computing sensor network along the pipelines and using smart sensors to “listen ” for potential threat; {{if there is a}} real threat, raise some form of alarm. For efficient pipeline monitoring, a novel monitoring approach is proposed. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was studied and applied. Eigenvalues were regarded as the special signature that could characterize a sound sample, and were thus used for the feature vector for sound recognition. The denoising ability of PCA could make it robust to noise interference. One class SVM was used for classifier. On-site experiment results show that the proposed PCA and SVM based acoustic recognition system will be very effective with a low tendency for raising false <b>alarms.</b> Keywords—One <b>class</b> SVM, pipeline monitoring system, principal component analysis, sound recognition, third party damage.

A time based rule associates an <b>alarm</b> <b>class</b> with the S-tartTime attribute and other attributes of alarms. The rules are evaluated with {{the coverage of the}} rules in the training data set. Given a new alarm generated at a particular time, its <b>alarm</b> <b>class</b> can be predicted with a set of time based rules. We present a new algorithm that extracts time based rules from alarm data through an ant colony optimization (ACO) process. Given an alarm training data, a search space is formulated as a square matrix indexed by distinctive attribute values. The pheromone at the search space is computed from the training data and a time based rule is discovered from the pheromone distribution. The pheromone distribution is updated after a time based rule is extracted and the search for a new rule starts. A rule pruning process is used to remove redundant rules and increase the prediction accuracy of the final rule set. We experimented the new method on Nokia Simmons (NSN) and Ericsson data sets and compared the results of the new method and the TimeSeluth system.

40|$|A {{large number}} of alarm sounds {{triggered}} by biomedical equipment occur frequently in the noisy environment of a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and {{play a key role}} in providing healthcare. In this paper, our work on the development of an automatic system for detection of acoustic alarms in that difficult environment is presented.

The approach presented in this paper consists of using the available knowledge about each <b>alarm</b> <b>class</b> in the design of the detection system. The information about the frequency structure is used in the feature extraction stage and the time structure knowledge is incorporated at the post-processing stage.

40|$|Cyber {{security}} {{is vital to}} the success of today’s digital economy. The major security threats are coming from within, as opposed to outside forces. Insider threat detection and prediction are important mitigation techniques. This study addresses the following research questions: 1) what are the research trends in insider threat detection and prediction nowadays? 2) What are the challenges associated with insider threat detection and prediction? 3) What are the best-to-date insider threat detection and prediction algorithms? We conduct a systematic review of 37 articles published in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings and edited books for the period of 1950 – 2015 to address the first two questions. Our survey suggests that game theoretic approach (GTA) is a popular source of insider threat data; the insiders’ online activities are the most widely used features in insider threat detection and prediction; most of the papers use single point estimates of threat likelihood; and graph algorithms are the most widely used tools for detecting and predicting insider threats. The key challenges facing the insider threat detection and prediction system include unbounded patterns, uneven time lags between activities, data nonstationarity, individuality, collusion attacks, high false <b>alarm</b> rates, <b>class</b> imbalance problem, undetected insider attacks, uncertainty, and the large number of free parameters in the model.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] In this thesis, a possibilistic K-nearest neighbor classifier {{is presented to}} distinguish between and classify mine and non-mine targets on data obtained from wideband electromagnetic induction sensors. The goal of this work is to develop methods for classifying wide-band electromagnetic induction data into one of several target classes or a non-target class. For some landmine detection systems, it could be necessary or helpful to discriminate between the several classes of targets, {{so that they can}} be analyzed and processed according to their specific properties. For example, it might be of importance to distinguish mines with high-metal content versus low-metal content or distinguish between anti-personnel versus anti-tank landmines. The proposed classifier achieves this goal using a method that is motivated by the observation that different buried object types often have consistent signatures depending on their metal content, size, shape, and depth. Given a sparse representation obtained using the joint orthogonal matching pursuits algorithm, particular target types consistently selected the same dictionary elements for their sparse representation. The proposed classifier distinguishes between particular target types using the frequency of dictionary elements selected by an alarm. Possibilistic weights are assigned for each alarm for sixteen landmine target classes as well as a false <b>alarm</b> <b>class.</b> The proposed classifier accuracy is compared to several state of the art methods and it shows improvement in discrimination results...|$|E
40|$|Children, LiteratureThe Age of Adolescence Ellen Handler Spitz Jepp, Who Defied the Stars by Katherine Marsh Hyperion, 385 pp., $ 16. 99 THIS PAST SUMMER, with a transfixed ten-year old by my side, I {{stood in}} Madrid’s {{palatial}} Museo Nacional del Prado, {{face to face}} with Diego Rodríguez de Silva y Velázquez. We gazed at the self-portrait of this grand master of the bravura brush stroke, gripping his palette in his left hand and wielding a paintbrush in his right, and we admired the wasp-waisted five-year-old Infanta Margarita who poses pertly before him in the endlessly fascinating Las Meninas. I pointed out diminutive King Philip IV and his queen, caught in their black-rimmed mirror just left of a coffered door, which opens mysteriously onto a dazzle of light. But about the court dwarfs—Maria Bárbola, with her bulbous head and short arms, and Nicolasito Pertusato, who kicks the lazy mastiff—I had little to say. A barrage of earnest questions from the child beside me exposed a glaring lacuna in my art history background. Why are they there? What are they doing? Were they servants, too? Why did the Spanish court keep them? As a girl, Katherine Marsh was similarly mesmerized by the dwarfs in Velázquez’s masterpiece, and by those that appear in other paintings of the period. To explore their plight, she conceived Jepp, Who Defied the Stars—her latest venture into books for young readers. Jepp is a first-person narrative, an historical novel set in the Spanish-ruled Netherlands of the late sixteenth century and in Denmark. Permit me a sigh of discontent that Las Meninas is nowhere to be found between the covers of her book, for its reproduction would have served {{as a model for the}} way that works of visual art can spark literary creation. This very painting, after all, inspired Oscar Wilde’s heartbreaking tale of an Infanta who laughs a little dwarf to death on her twelfth birthday. Throughout Jepp, Marsh’s well-imagined title character and her other court dwarfs provide answers to some of the questions raised by Las Meninas. After a happy childhood in a village near Utrecht, Jepp arrives at the Spanish court of Coudenberg in Brussels to become a court dwarf. He is brought there by a strange courtier, Don Diego (who later proves to be Jepp’s absent—and deceased—father’s younger brother). At fourteen, the boy is no taller than he was at seven. In Brussels, the Infanta treats Jepp and his cohort handsomely, but rather like toys or pets. She expects them to amuse and divert her, but they are not regarded as fully human. Courtiers and servants shamelessly touch their bodies ad libitum, costume them at will, and make them suffer a host of indignities (Jepp’s first is to jump out of a pie served to the Infanta). Far more horrifyingly, a delicate blond dwarf named Lia, Jepp’s friend, is victim of a secret rape by a courtier named Pim. Lia persuades Jepp to accompany her in an attempted escape so as to bear her baby in freedom, but she dies in childbirth. While it successfully conveys the degradation to which the dwarfs were subjected historically, the inclusion of this dark episode in a book for young readers may expose some pre-teens to an excess of depravity. Before her violation, Lia enjoys a close friendship with Robert, a kindly Hagrid-like giant who is also retained by the Infanta as a grotesque, and the court immediately assumes that it was he who made her pregnant. Marsh’s florid evocation of this huge male copulating with this tiny female, even though it proves false, may seem to corroborate widespread childhood fantasies of sexual acts as aggressive conquests. Eventually Jepp is banished from the Infanta’s presence, and his story continues while he is en route to another castle, Uraniborg in Denmark; he is transported there from Brussels in a cage reminiscent of the contraption occupied by the outsized Lemuel Gulliver in Brobdingnag. The latter parts of Marsh’s novel find him under the aegis of the famous astronomer Tycho Brahe, an eccentric island-dwelling, silver-nosed scientist, whose beer-guzzling moose attends dinner in his castle. Jepp is made to eat on the floor under the table at Tycho’s feet. What makes all this particularly poignant in the context of “young adult” fiction is that Jepp and his cohort—diminutive persons who appear neither adult nor child—can so easily stand in for the book’s intended readers. Suffering extreme humiliation, Marsh’s characters not only teach historical injustice but, closer to home, they mirror the manipulation, objectification, and failure to be taken seriously that many teens and pre-teens feel they endure under uncomprehending adults. The dwarfs in Marsh’s novel, moreover, are propelled by their frustrations into unproductive behaviors: at Coudenberg, one preens constantly before a looking glass, and another is addicted to hippocras. Under conditions of oppression, their relations with one another are tarnished by rivalry and suspicion. Thus the dwarfs become, in Marsh’s skillful hands, supremely sympathetic figures. In pre-adolescence, our bodies morph, betraying us day by day. Alien to ourselves as well as to others, we yearn to shoot up instantly or to stop growing altogether—to shrink back into warm childhood, where right and wrong lay neatly folded in separate piles on a shelf. But the door to childhood is shut. Adolescents are newly encased—like Jepp—in bodies that seem too small (or too large) but never a match for what is inside them, which nobody else can see. Marsh’s characters capture many near-ubiquitous experiences of this particular stage of life. Jepp exists in relative emotional isolation: his body, psyche, and surrounds feel intermittently out of sync. Features of Marsh’s plot parallel with psychological acuity deep levels of pre-adolescent experience. Haunted in a fatherless household by the mystery of his paternity, Jepp longs to find his father. The desire to find one’s true, lost parents animates, as we know, not only the fantasy lives of youth who have endured bereavement, abandonment, and adoption, but also of many a discomfited teen. During much of Marsh’s story, Jepp narrates his adventures while traveling like a small animal in a cage. A rough keeper named Matheus tosses in his daily food, and he knows not his destination. Again, modern echoes abound: despite the plethora of insignificant choices accorded them, young people’s lives are not in their hands, and they often feel cooped up in prisons not of their making. Marsh’s doubled narration (Jepp reminiscing about Coudenberg on his way to Uraniborg) mirrors the way youth balks haltingly at the regimentation of cultural clock time (<b>alarm</b> buzzers, <b>class</b> bells), their jerky back-and-forth between outer and inner worlds captured so brilliantly by Bill Watterson in his Calvin and Hobbes comic strips. Marsh evokes this wonderfully, with all its puzzling confusion. As one reads Jepp, Who Defied the Stars, present and past entangle just as childhood and adulthood spar. Over the course of this fine novel, what matters principally is that a meek, naïve boy, easily manipulated and duped to the point of endangering himself and his friends, develops—despite his handicap—into a more mature character, capable of assuming responsibility for his choices and responding finally to the devotion of a fiercely independent young woman. Jepp progresses from adoration of frail Lia to love for Magdalene, the daughter of Tycho Brahe, who is not a dwarf. In an image that reverses the Robert-Lia fantasy, Magdalene towers over Jepp, and from her he learns the necessity of accepting fate while acting “out of love rather than fear. ” Caught between worlds, Jepp not only grows up, he becomes real. He exits forever the world of Las Meninas, but this time with life and with hope. Ellen Handler Spitz is Honors College Professor at the University of Maryland (UMBC).

40|$|The {{building}} in XXX {{was constructed in}} XXX. It was designed using the International Building Code (IBC). This fire protection analysis report will be reviewing the building based on the 2015 edition of the IBC including several performance based fire scenarios involving the smoke exhaust system. The passive system section highlights the physical construction of the building. The building is a business occupancy with three separate stories including a penthouse which {{is included in the}} third story. The building has adequate fire ratings for a Type II-B construction except for heavy timber columns within the commons of the building. It seems likely that the designer obtained a waiver for construction with use of these heavy timber beams, but it still needs to be verified. In addition to the heavy timber construction issue, there was a concern with the egress requirements of the large conference room on the first floor. This conference room has the ability to be partitioned into three separate conference rooms. When this is achieved, the occupant load for each of these three separate smaller conference rooms is higher than an occupant load of 50. There is only one door per each of these smaller conference rooms. This is a violation of the IBC 2015 edition. The fire suppression section highlighted the capabilities of the sprinkler system. The fire flow test shows that there is a high enough water capacity at a high enough pressure for the worst case locations within the building to be supplied to meet NFPA 13. There is no need for a fire pump in this building. The fire alarm section highlights the construction of the fire alarm system. The fire <b>alarm</b> system uses <b>Class</b> A wiring as required by the AHJ for this type of construction. In addition to being a Class A wiring connection, additional provisions were included in the fire alarm system to an emergency voice notification system that notifies occupants {{in case of an emergency}} on the steps needed to maintain safety in emergency situations. Included in the fire alarm system are various panels including a Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP), 3 Transponder Panels (TP), 9 Notification Appliance Circuit Panels (NACP), and a Smoke Control Panel included in the fire alarm system. There is an issues with the placement of smoke detectors. There are no smoke detectors protecting the FACP and associated panels which does not meet NFPA 72 requirements. The smoke control system is interconnected to the fire alarm system via the smoke control panel. In the event of a fire, the smoke is exhausted through the ceiling through use of eight exhaust fans and make up air is funneled through inlets in the floors of the common areas and vents in the commons (conference rooms) through the use of five supply fans. This was a focal point in the performance based fire modeling section of the report. The performance based fire analysis focuses on two fire scenarios. The first scenario focuses an atrium fire and the second fire scenario focuses on a fire in the main conference room that removes the ability to egress through one of the three doors within the room. The two fire scenarios are not meant to verify acceptability based on NFPA 96 requirements for an exhaust system for an atrium. The fire scenarios shown to illustrate semi-realistic fires in the main conference room on the first floor and in the center of the atrium. The tenability requirements looked at for these fire scenarios were for visibility, CO (carbon monoxide) concentrations within the space, and the temperature of the air in within the space. The minimum tenability for visibility was determined to be 10 meters. Jin suggests that the criteria for visibility range from 13 ft to 46 ft (4 m to 14 m). Jin suggests a tenability limit of 10 m (33 ft) for occupants unfamiliar with a building based on his studies of people exposed to smoke. 10 m (33 ft) seems like a reasonable selection criteria for limiting visibility criterion in a non-complex building with reasonably sized rooms and square footage of the building. The minimum tenability for both the Oxbow building and the conference room on the first floor was determined due to this rational because there are periodic tours of the building and visitors that tend to join conferences within the conference room on the first floor. The minimum tenability requirement for CO concentrations was 0. 1 FED. This value was conservative enough for very low chances of affecting personnel that were sensitive to either toxic gases or asphyxiation because there are other contaminates in addition to CO concentration produced in fires depending on the materials burnt. “Hartzell [2] states that a (Ct) CO of 35, 000 ppm×min has the potential to cause serious harm to many occupants and therefore (Ct) CO = 35, 000 ppm×min would be a reasonable representation of an FED of 1. 0. If LC 50 data for rats is used, the value is 171, 000 ppm min. ” The value of 35, 000 was determined to be 1. 0 in this example. Using 35, 000 ppm, 0. 1 FED was determined to 1, 166 ppm of total exposure. The minimum tenability requirement for air temperature was determined to be 60 ° C. An exposure to a temperature of 60 º C was determined to be the worst case tenable condition for this fire model because exposure to a temperature of 60 º C air for 1 second will produce pain and 10 seconds or more will produce burns. The atrium based fire scenario shows that the building can be fully egressed with the all three of minimum required tenable requirements for visibility, CO concentration, and air temperature. Whereas, the fire scenario for egressing the conference room had visibility and CO concentration tenability issues. The analysis has determined the following conclusions and recommendations for meeting the IBC, 2015 edition: 1) The number of doors exiting the large conference room is not adequate. Recommendation: Add doors on the far sides of the conference room and include a type of interlock to the room separators to only allow one to be used at a given time. 2) Smoke detectors were not installed near the Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP), transponder panels, and the Notification Appliance Circuit (NAC) panels. Recommendation: If feasible, install smoke detectors in these locations. At minimum, a smoke detector should be installed near the FACP. 3) Heavy timber columns were installed in the atrium area. Recommendation: Verify waver from fire marshal for construction. If waver was not obtained, the heavy timber beams may need to be encased, replaced, or another alternative acceptable by the fire marshal...|$|R
