40|$|Abundant coal {{deposits}} {{have very}} low inorganic contents (ash yield; < 2 %) and hence are almost ash-free. Inexplicable {{to date is}} that the precursor of coal, modern peat deposits, almost nowhere have such low <b>ash</b> <b>yields</b> {{as a result of}} both the inorganic mineral and biogenic phytolith contents. However, despite the common occurrence of phytoliths in modern peats, they are invariably absent in coals. It has thus been hypothesized by some investigators that modern environments are not ideal analogues for the formation of low ash coal deposits. Here we present new evidence to suggest that mineral diagenesis during coalification can transform biogenic inorganics to new minerals and that a substantial component of these new minerals could be removed in solution during expulsion of moisture with coalification resulting in low ash precursors of coal. This study presents results from artificial coalification experiments of modern tropical forest peat material with <b>ash</b> <b>yields</b> between 2 - 4. 3 wt. %. The inorganic material of the peat consists almost exclusively of Al-Si-and Si-rich phytoliths and other bioliths; no other inorganic mineral matter is present. Compressed pellets of dried peat were deformed in a Griggs constant strain rate apparatus at a constant confining pressure of 5 kb and constant strain rate of 10 - 5 s - 1 at variable temperatures from 350 [degree sign]C to 550 [degree sign]C. The samples, exposed to artificial coalification processes, were then analysed by SEM, EDS, and XRD for semi-quantitative chemical analyses. The deformed material showed a lack of any biogenic silica and Al-Si-phytoliths, but contained neoformed idiomorphic quartz crystals and clays. We conclude that modern peat forming environments that have low-ash peats containing biogenic silica and other biogenic Al-Si-material can represent precursors of very low-ash coal deposits. Our experiments illustrate that during coalification, it is likely all or almost all biogenic material is transformed into new minerals, mainly quartz and clay minerals, such as kaolinite. Because natural systems are not confined to the same degree as our experiments, it is likely that part or all of the inorganic fraction migrates in solutions out of the peat or coal seam with available fluids, resulting in an almost ash-free coal deposit...|$|R

The REY distribution patterns indicate that the light REY is enriched and show a well-pronounced Eu minimum. The fractionation of individual light-REY is {{higher than that of}} the heavy-REY. The REY distribution through the K 2 coal seam shows that the top and bottom portion of the coal seam have a lower content of REY than the middle portion.

The REY distributions through the coal seam, SEM-EDX data and the correlation analysis between <b>ash</b> <b>yields</b> and the concentrations have revealed that the REY mainly occurs in the organic matter. The K 2 coal is a potential rare-metal resource due to its high REY contents, and the coal ash could be regarded as a new and promising raw material for recovery of REY as a by-product.|$|R
30|$|Most coals {{analyzed}} {{for this study}} have high total sulfur contents and high <b>ash</b> <b>yields.</b> Vitrinite is the dominant maceral group in all the coals, followed by inertinite. The minerals in LTAs of Niuchang-Yigu coals are mainly quartz, kaolinite, chamosite, mixed-layer I/S, pyrite, and calcite, with trace amounts of marcasite, dolomite, and bassanite. Quartz is mainly embedded in collodetrinite and occurs as cleat- and cell-fillings. The silica was primarily transported by aqueous solutions originated from the weathering of basaltic rocks in the Kangdian Upland and by hydrothermal fluids. The presence of β-quartz paramorph grains, distributed in collodetrinite, probably indicates that quartz from volcanic ash was deposited during peat accumulation. Clay minerals generally occur in collodetrinite and as fill in coal-forming plant cells. The chamosite {{was the product of}} Fe- and Mg-rich solutions that were probably generated by volcanic activity. In most cases, pyrite occurs as framboidal, anhedral, and euhedral particles in collodetrinite but it also is present as cell-fillings. The high pyrite content is probably the result of seawater invasion during early diagenesis. A small proportion of the carbonate minerals present occur as detrital grains in collodetrinite but most of the calcite occurs as vein-fillings and no doubt has an epigenetic hydrothermal origin.|$|R
40|$|The Soma Basin hosts three coal seams (kM 2, kM 3 and kP 1) {{and several}} altered tuff layers within the Miocene sequences. This study {{focuses on the}} {{determination}} of coal petrography, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, mineralogy and elemental contents of the three coal seams from Eynez, Işıklar and Deniş sectors in the basin, and to identify the mineralogy of altered tuff layers within kM 2 and kP 1 seams. The routine coal quality analyses show that coal samples from the kM 2 seam are characterized by lower <b>ash</b> <b>yields</b> and total S contents, and higher gross calorific values than kM 3 and kP 1 seams. The mineralogical composition of the bulk coal samples from the kM 2 seam is made up mainly of quartz, clay minerals and lesser amounts of feldspars and carbonates. In the kM 3 and {{as well as in}} the lower part of kP 1 seam carbonate minerals are being dominant phases due to the existences of fossil shell-bearing bands in the coal beds and intercalations. The statistical data implies that major elements in bulk coal samples, such as Al, Fe, K, Mg and Na, and the vast majority of minor and trace elements, as we expected, have inorganic affinity. The trace element contents and elemental enrichments are generally changeable from seam to seam; nevertheless, Cs, Li and U are commonly enriched in all studied coal seams. These could be related to the differences ion <b>ash</b> <b>yields</b> and mineralogical compositions of coal beds within the seams. The mineralogical compositions of the altered tuff layers identified within the kM 2 and kP 1 seams display similar compositions with tonsteins; therefore, these layers are presumably in air-fall ash that were originated from synchronous felsic volcanic activities around the basin. The existences of volcanic layers also have has some influences on the mineralogical and elemental composition of both seams. The SEM data shows that clay minerals originated from these layers and certain trace elements (e. g. As and Zr) are 2 enriched in the coal layers below the tuff layers in the kM 2 seam. This might be related to penetration of leached pore waters into these layers and precipitation of epigenetic minerals. The coal petrography data and coal facies diagram show that precursor peat of the kM 2 seam was accumulating under telmatic, mesotrophic anoxic conditions where the water level was high and stable. The relatively low <b>ash</b> <b>yields</b> and thicker coal beds suggest the a lower clastic input ratio from the margins; therefore, the aluminosilicate affiliated elements display lower concentrations in this seam. Following periods when the, water-table fluctuated several times and covered entire mire surface; thus, peat formation ceased and several clastic and calcareous intercalations were deposited in the kM 3 and kP 1 seams. These imply the development of limno-telmatic conditions where fluvial influences took places during peat accumulation of both seams. Therefore, clastic inputs from the margins were high which resulted in elevated the concentrations of aluminosilicate affiliated elements. Furthermore, the mineralogical compositions of coal and intercalations of both seams also suggest the development of neutral to alkaline conditions. Considering the maceral compositions along with the thickness of coal, coal seams in the Soma Basin might have and can suggest the indicate oil generation potential; however, the data of pyrolysis analysis data shows that the studied coal seams are mainly gas-prone and only certain coal beds have mixed hydrocarbon generation capacity. Nevertheless, the changes of vegetation and depositional conditions also have reflections on the HI values. The slightly higher HI and TOC in the kM 2 seems to be related to high contribution of woody material in peat and the development of more acidic conditions, whereas the predominance of herbaceous plant and alkaline conditions in the kM 3 and kP 1 seams resulted in relative low HI and TOC values. All data presented in this study indicates that lithological features, differences in coal qualities and elemental contents in the Soma Basin were mainly controlled by changes ion the depositional conditions and as well as detrital inputs during Miocene...|$|R

It is concluded that pyrolysis costs compare positively with pig manure transportation costs of 0. 06 € t− 1 km− 1, while it also offsets phosphorus extraction from the rapidly depleting phosphate rock...|$|R
