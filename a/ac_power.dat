5|$|Major {{expansion}} of the network began with the commissioning of the 735kV <b>AC</b> <b>power</b> line in November 1965, as {{there was a need}} for electricity transmission over vast distances from the north to southern Quebec.|$|E
5|$|During that year, Tesla {{worked in}} Pittsburgh, helping {{to create an}} {{alternating}} current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement <b>AC</b> <b>power.</b> Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found {{that it would not}} work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.|$|E
5|$|Hydro-Québec's {{electricity}} transmission system {{is an international}} power transmission system centred in Quebec, Canada. The system pioneered the use of very high voltage 735kV alternating current (<b>AC)</b> <b>power</b> lines that link the population centers of Montreal and Quebec City to distant hydroelectric power stations like the Daniel-Johnson Dam and the James Bay Project in northwestern Quebec and the Churchill Falls Generating Station in Labrador.|$|E

5|$|It is {{very common}} {{practice}} for power companies or their customers to impose harmonic distortion limits based on IEC or IEEE standards. For example, IEEE Standard 519 limits at the customer's connection point call for the maximum individual frequency voltage harmonic {{to be no more}} than 3% of the fundamental and call for the voltage total harmonic distortion (THD) to be no more than 5% for a general <b>AC</b> <b>power</b> supply system.|$|E
5|$|NuScale's design {{does not}} rely on powered water pumps or circulatory equipment. The company claims it can shut down and {{continue}} cooling itself indefinitely {{in the event of}} a catastrophe. The devices are intended to be kept in a below-ground pool, to absorb the shock of earthquakes, with a concrete lid over the pool. In the event that <b>AC</b> <b>power</b> is lost for normal cooling systems, the pool water begins to absorb heat and boil.|$|E
5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the <b>AC</b> <b>power</b> supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the <b>AC</b> <b>power</b> waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E
50|$|The C428 {{would have}} been a 2,750-horsepower, four-axle locomotive, powered by the same engine as the C628. Due to the {{complexity}} of DC generators at this level of <b>power,</b> the <b>AC</b> <b>powered</b> C430 was developed instead.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} comparative {{performances of}} an linear and disk <b>AC</b> MHD <b>power</b> generation with an active power. The configuration of linear and disk consist {{of the top}} and bottom stators. the top stator bottom stator winding are connected with a power supply and an electrical load, respectively. The interaction between the metal fluid and traveling magnetic field can be explained by Maxwell’s equations and Ohm’s law based on the method of finite-elements. Power flow and electrical efficiency of an <b>AC</b> MHD <b>power</b> generation have been evaluated by various slip conditions. The optimal operating point of the generator was defined by adjusting slip values. The result confirms that disk <b>AC</b> MHD <b>power</b> generation has high active power more than linear <b>AC</b> MHD <b>power</b> generation at the same slip...|$|R

5|$|Westinghouse Electric asked Tesla to {{participate}} in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago where the company had a large space in a building devoted to electrical exhibits. Westinghouse Electric won the bid to light the Exposition with alternating current and it was a key event in the history of <b>AC</b> <b>power,</b> as the company demonstrated to the American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of a fully integrated alternating current system. Tesla showed a series of electrical effects related to alternating current as well as his wireless lighting system, using a demonstration he had previously performed throughout America and Europe; these included using high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current to light a wireless gas-discharge lamp.|$|E
5|$|For {{passenger}} {{service the}} F40PH has another electrical alternator, the head-end generator. The HEP unit generates three-phase <b>AC</b> <b>power</b> at 480 V (500kW {{on the first}} order, 800kW on later units) for lighting, heating and air-conditioning the train. Originally, F40PHs powered the HEP alternator from the prime mover; from the head end to the train must be a constant frequency, and the prime mover had to turn at a constant 893 RPM while supplying head end power (even standing still, with the throttle in idle). Power to the traction motors was controlled by varying the field excitation of the main (traction) generator. On some later versions of the F40PH (and on many rebuilt F40s), a second small diesel engine {{at the rear of}} the locomotive powers the HEP alternator. In these engines, the prime-mover speed varies in the usual way; they can be identified by the diesel exhaust {{at the rear of the}} locomotive and by their quiet idle. Remaining F40s, with the constant-RPM prime movers, are noticeably louder.|$|E
50|$|The first, class BB1, were <b>AC</b> <b>powered</b> {{and served}} as prototypes. The second, class BB2, were DC powered and served in the New York Terminal district, {{specifically}} between Sunnyside Yard and New York Penn Station. The third, class BB3, was <b>AC</b> <b>powered</b> and built for the Long Island Rail Road's electrified freight operation on the Bay Ridge Branch. In 1934 a follow-up order of 14 locomotives were built as single unit class B1 for the expanding main line AC electrification system. In addition to these new units all previous BB classes were split into single units and the BB2 class were re-powered for AC operation as that system replaced the old 650VDC system in the New York terminal. At this point all 42 units were re-classed as PRR B1.|$|R

5|$|The Odyssey {{consists}} of a black, white, and brown oblong box connected by wires to two rectangular controllers. The primary console box connects to the television set through an included switchbox, which allows the player to switch the television input between the Odyssey and the regular television input cable, and presents itself like a television channel. The controllers, which are designed {{to sit on a}} flat surface, contain one button marked Reset {{on the top of the}} controller and three knobs: one on the right side of the controller, and two on the left with one extending from the other. The reset button does not reset the game, but instead is used by different games to reset individual elements, such as making a player's dot visible after it is turned off during a game. The system can be powered by six C batteries, which were included. An optional <b>AC</b> <b>power</b> supply was sold separately. The Odyssey lacks sound capability and can only display monochrome white shapes on a blank black screen.|$|E
