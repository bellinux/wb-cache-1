During the fight, Batwoman reveals her identity to Bette when she mentions her tennis career, and in the aftermath Bette is seen in her Flamebird outfit, saying that she wants to be Kate's new partner.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie go to {{the mall}} so they can meet Santa, but Peter is asking Santa for gifts (he asks for a game of Uno, a Magna Doodle, a pet chink (a mix of a {{chinchilla}} and a mink) and a Charles in Charge lunchbox.) When the mall Santa leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie sit in his lap, Santa mentions he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that Santa leaving before he got a chance to sit in his lap felt like a bigger betrayal than the betrayal of Gary Busey by reality; this takes us to Busey looking himself in the mirror asking his reflection, in the form of <b>a</b> <b>crazed</b> clown, how he is doing.|$|E
5|$|Code: Veronicas story, setting, {{and artistic}} design strayed {{away from the}} series standard. While {{previous}} games are set in the United States and have a corresponding American feel to them, Code: Veronica {{is set in the}} Southern Ocean and Antarctica and carries a European gothic horror inspired design. This is made clear in the environments which features gothic architecture and art in addition to central European carvings and German-style weaponry. In addition, the gothic feel is emphasized through the story. The horror in Code: Veronica is driven by this story which follows <b>a</b> <b>crazed</b> man and the fate of his noble bloodline. The story is told partly through a lullaby, and this method of story telling is intended to bring out European operatic undertones. This contrasts to previous games in the series which were driven by the panic elements from American horror films, such as monsters and zombies. With regards to managing the art staff, Mikami split them up depending on their interests. Those interested in guns worked solely on gun designs while those interested in environments were sent to photograph houses and castles for research.|$|E

5|$|In the Conquest route, the Avatar both {{fights in}} the war against Hoshido, and works with their adoptive family to change Nohr's brutal {{reputation}} from within. After Azura reveals that King Garon has been replaced by an impostor, the Avatar decides to have Garon sit upon the magical throne of Hoshido, which will remove the false Garon's disguise. During the invasion of Hoshido, the Nohrians spare Hinoka and capture Sakura, while Takumi, whose behavior has become increasingly erratic and violent throughout the war, apparently dies by jumping off of a rampart. Garon orders the Avatar to kill Ryoma. After their fight, Ryoma spares the Avatar the pain of killing their own brother by killing himself. Infusing the Yato with the power of Xander and Leo's Legendary Weapons, the Avatar confronts and kills the false Garon. However, <b>a</b> <b>crazed</b> Takumi suddenly appears and attacks them, and it is revealed he has been long dead and his body is possessed. The Avatar destroys Takumi's body to free his soul. Azura overuses her powers as in the Birthright route, but her death is not seen and she is instead marked as missing. In the epilogue, Hinoka is crowned queen of Hoshido and Xander is crowned king of Nohr, and a peaceful alliance between the two kingdoms is formed.|$|E
5|$|Upon his return, Edge {{began to}} show some villainous {{characteristics}} centering on his obsession for the World Heavyweight Championship. Edge, Chris Benoit, and Shawn Michaels received a title shot for Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship at Taboo Tuesday in October 2004. Michaels won the audience vote to receive the title shot, giving Edge and Benoit a tag team title shot. During the match, an angry Edge abandoned his partner (although Benoit managed to win the title on his own) and instead interfered in the main event, costing Michaels the championship. On the November 1 episode of Raw, Edge and Benoit lost the World Tag Team Championship with Edge abandoning Benoit again and {{sitting in a chair}} and watching the match. After the conclusion of the match, Edge attacked Benoit, officially turning heel {{for the first time since}} 2001. Edge then adopted a drastically different gimmick, becoming <b>a</b> <b>crazed</b> and brash villain in the process. At Survivor Series, Edge was part of Team Triple H along with Triple H, Batista and Snitsky. They were defeated by Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Maven). During the match, Edge eliminated both Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho before getting eliminated by Randy Orton.|$|E

50|$|The final {{movement}} {{opens with}} <b>a</b> slightly <b>crazed</b> upbeat character, in the vein of Arnold's lighter orchestral pieces.

The symphony closes with confidence.|$|R

Boldwood, as every one supposed he would do, had pleaded guilty, and had been sentenced to death.|$|R
25|$|Dando's BBC {{colleague}} Nick Ross stated on Newsnight on {{the night}} of her death that retaliatory attacks by criminals against police, lawyers and judges were almost unknown in Britain. Finally, forensic examination of the cartridge case and bullet recovered from the scene of the attack suggested that the weapon used had been the result of a workshop conversion of a replica or decommissioned gun. It was argued that a professional assassin would not use such a poor quality weapon. The police therefore soon began to favour the idea that the killing had been carried out by <b>a</b> <b>crazed</b> individual acting on an opportunist basis. This assumed profile of the perpetrator led to the focus on Barry George.|$|E
25|$|In Part II, Evgenii finds a ferryman and {{commands}} him to row {{to where}} Parasha's home {{used to be}} (ll. 26 – ll. 56). However, he discovers that her home has been destroyed (ll. 57–60), and falls into <b>a</b> <b>crazed</b> delirium and breaks into laughter (ll. 61–65). For a year, he roams the street as a madman (ll. 89–130), but the following autumn, he is reminded of {{the night of the}} storm (ll. 132–133) and the source of his troubles. In a fit of rage, he curses the statue of Peter (ll. 177–179), which brings the statue to life, and Peter begins pursuing Evgenii (ll. 180–196). The narrator does not describe Evgenii's death directly, but the poem closes with the discovery of his corpse in a ruined hut floating on the water (ll. 219–222).|$|E
25|$|In 1994, writer Scott Lobdell {{set up a}} {{relationship}} between Braddock and her teammate Archangel. The character is severely injured by <b>a</b> <b>crazed</b> Sabretooth in the Lobdell-written Uncanny X-Men #328. Her life is saved {{by the use of}} a mystic artifact known as the Crimson Dawn, the aftereffects of which granted Psylocke the ability to teleport in and out of shadows. Lobdell also temporarily took her out of the X-Men roster this issue. Braddock returns to the team in X-Men, vol. 2 #77–78, where she uses her Crimson Dawn-enhanced telepathy to trap the Shadow King in the astral plane. Any use of her telepathy would result in his release, so she forgoes the use of her telepathic ability. Some time later she would develop telekinesis for the first time instead. Psylocke's relationship with Archangel ends in the Claremont written X-Men, vol. 2 #109, where the character embarks upon {{a relationship}} with new Indian X-Men recruit Neal Shaara, also known as Thunderbird.|$|E

An ex-soldier, he has pawned most of his clothes to buy the gin in his basket, next to the pamphlet that denounces it. Next to him sits a black dog, a symbol of despair and depression. Outside the distiller a fight has broken out, and <b>a</b> <b>crazed</b> cripple raises his crutch to strike his blind compatriot.|$|E
25|$|King {{served as}} an elected county {{commission}} member in Fulton County, Georgia, the county encompassing most of Atlanta, from 1987 to 1993. He was defeated for reelection after revealing that he owed the federal government more than $200,000 in back taxes and fines. Also in 1993, King helped found the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr. Inc., the company that manages the license of Martin Luther King Jr.'s image and intellectual property. King remains a commissioner in the company as of 2008. During his service as a commissioner in Fulton County, King expressed appreciation to an officer who potentially saved his mother from harm from <b>a</b> <b>crazed</b> man. In February 2009, King and his wife traveled to India, fifty years after {{his father and mother}} made the trip. During his stay in India, King led a delegation, which included John Lewis and Andrew Young. In New Delhi, King visited museums on Mahatma Gandhi's life and answered questions from students. King denounced the war in Iraq and the Mumbai attacks during a lecture at the Indian Council for Cultural Relations.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{initiation}} ceremony and induction into {{the society and}} the receiving of the word, the horseman who were not {{members of the society}} but potential candidates would have trouble with horses. This would often be caused by older ploughmen who were members of the society tampering with their horses. They would put things like tacks under the horse's collar to cause it to behave irrationally. This would be unknown to the potential candidate as the techniques for training and controlling the horses were not yet given to him. Most of these techniques were based on the horse's sharp sense of smell. Foul substances placed in front of the horse or on the animal itself would cause it to refuse to move forward. This technique is known as jading and is still used by horse trainers today. There were also pleasant smelling things that were used to make a horse move forward or calm down. If the substance was an oil it could be wiped on the trainer's forehead, they would then {{stand in front of the}} animal and the smell would draw it towards them. This practice was often used in taming unruly horses. There were also pleasant smelling and inviting materials, such as sweets, that the horseman could keep in their pocket in order to calm, attract, and subdue <b>a</b> <b>crazed</b> horse. Keeping these techniques secret, along with the myth that there was a word that only the horseman knew that gave them and them alone power over horses helped guarantee their reputation, prestige, job security, and pay. The same type of logic and protection of trade secrets can be seen among modern magicians who keep their tricks secret and only share them with other members of their trade.|$|E
