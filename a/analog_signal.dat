5|$|In a {{broadcast}} system, the central high-powered broadcast tower transmits a high-frequency electromagnetic wave to numerous low-powered receivers. The high-frequency wave {{sent by the}} tower is modulated with a signal containing visual or audio information. The receiver is then tuned so as {{to pick up the}} high-frequency wave and a demodulator is used to retrieve the signal containing the visual or audio information. The broadcast signal can be either <b>analog</b> (<b>signal</b> is varied continuously with respect to the information) or digital (information is encoded as a set of discrete values).|$|E
5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an <b>analog</b> <b>signal,</b> the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of noise is called additive noise, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E

50|$|WMEI, {{along with}} its {{satellite}} stations, was off the air for several months in early 2009. This was due to WMEI and WOST having shut down their <b>analog</b> <b>signals</b> in January 2009 {{to prepare for the}} digital transition. However, due to the transition date being delayed until June 12, 2009 (from its original February 17 date) and WTIN and WNJX-TV opting to retain their <b>analog</b> <b>signals</b> on WMEI and WOST's post transition channels until June, WMEI and WOST could not begin digital broadcasts until WTIN and WNJX terminated their <b>analog</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R

25|$|KTVU {{shut down}} its <b>analog</b> <b>signal,</b> over VHF channel 2, on June 12, 2009, {{as part of}} the federally {{mandated}} transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal was relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 56, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use {{as a result of the}} transition, to UHF channel 44 (the allocation previously occupied by KBCW's <b>analog</b> <b>signal),</b> using PSIP to display KTVU's virtual channel as 2 on digital television receivers.|$|E

The station's digital signal relocated from VHF channel 9 to channel 8. Immediately before WFAA ceased transmission of its <b>analog</b> <b>signal,</b> the station aired a retrospective of its history that was narrated by meteorologist Pete Delkus, which was followed by a video of the sign-off that the station had aired at the conclusion of its broadcast day during the 1970s.|$|E

50|$|Many {{embedded}} systems {{need to read}} sensors that produce <b>analog</b> <b>signals.</b> This {{is the purpose of}} the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Since processors are built to interpret and process digital data, i.e. 1s and 0s, they are not able to do anything with the <b>analog</b> <b>signals</b> that may be sent to it by a device. So the analog to digital converter is used to convert the incoming data into a form that the processor can recognize. A less common feature on some microcontrollers is a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) that allows the processor to output <b>analog</b> <b>signals</b> or voltage levels.|$|R
