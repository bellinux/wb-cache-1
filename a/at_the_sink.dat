5|$|The {{same idea}} of using a DAG to {{represent}} a family of paths occurs in the binary decision diagram, a DAG-based data structure for representing binary functions. In a binary decision diagram, each non-sink vertex is labeled {{by the name of}} a binary variable, and each sink and each edge is labeled by a 0 or 1. The function value for any truth assignment to the variables is the value <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> found by following a path, starting from the single source vertex, that at each non-sink vertex follows the outgoing edge labeled with the value of that vertex's variable. Just as directed acyclic word graphs {{can be viewed as a}} compressed form of tries, binary decision diagrams can be viewed as compressed forms of decision trees that save space by allowing paths to rejoin when they agree on the results of all remaining decisions.|$|E
