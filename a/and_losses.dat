40|$|Abstract. —With the {{availability}} of genomic sequence data, there is increasing interest in using genes with a possible history of duplication <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> for species tree inference. Here we assess the performance of both nonprobabilistic and probabilistic species tree inference approaches using gene duplication <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> coalescence simulations. We evaluated the performance of gene tree parsimony (GTP) based on duplication (Only-dup), duplication <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> (Dup-loss), <b>and</b> deep coalescence (Deep-c) costs, the NJst distance method, the MulRF supertree method, and PHYLDOG, which jointly estimates gene trees and species tree using a hierarchical probabilistic model. We {{examined the effects of}} gene tree and species sampling, gene tree error, <b>and</b> duplication <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> rates on the accuracy of phylogenetic estimates. In the 10 -taxon duplication <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> simulation experiments, MulRF is more accurate than the other methods when the duplication <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> rates are low, and Dup-loss is generally the most accurate when the duplication <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> rates are high. PHYLDOG performs well in 10 -taxon duplication <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> simulations, but its run time is prohibitively long on larger data sets. In the larger duplication <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> simulation experiments, MulRF outperforms all other methods in experiments with at most 100 taxa; however, in the larger simulation, Dup-loss generally performs best. In all duplication <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> simulation experiment...|$|R
40|$|This {{issue of}} the Journal brings {{together}} a number of comparative articles on illness, crisis, <b>and</b> <b>loss.</b> This issue illuminates that illness, crisis, <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> are central forces shaping personal biographies and social life across comparative cultures. These international articles draw on qualitative methodologies to tap an understanding of illness and in combination provide a broad yet holistic perspective on the interrelationships of illness, crisis <b>and</b> <b>loss.</b> Each of the articles illustrates how they contribute to social change and how the cultural meanings of illness, crisis <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> are created {{to make sense of}} personal experiences in contemporary society. These are important existential issues but also significant additions to debates and discussions on illness, crisis, <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> for practitioners, user groups, and researchers.

5|$|Playing {{under various}} {{names such as}} the Los Angeles Angels, California Angels, and Anaheim Angels, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim have been members of the American League since 1961. The team's first manager, Bill Rigney, led the squad for parts of eight seasons until his release in mid-1969. The current manager is Mike Scioscia, who holds most of the Angels' {{franchise}} records for manager. He is the only Angels skipper to be named Manager of the Year, a distinction he has earned twice (2002, 2009). His regular-season wins (1066) <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> (878), postseason wins (21) <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> (24), and winning percentage (.548) are the highest of any manager in team history. Dick Williams is the only Angels manager who has been inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Five managers have served multiple terms with the team: Gene Mauch, John McNamara, Buck Rodgers, Marcel Lachemann, and Joe Maddon.|$|E
