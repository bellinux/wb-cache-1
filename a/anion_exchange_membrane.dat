40|$|Reverse {{electrodialysis}} (RED) is a clean, {{sustainable technology}} for the generation of energy from the mixing of solutions with different salinity. The ion <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> are key elements in RED. Especially the study of <b>anion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> is crucial since limited {{research has been done}} specifically for RED. This PhD thesis investigates the design and development of the RED process, focusing on fabrication, characterization and optimization of <b>anion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes.</b> Chapter 2 deals with the fabrication of <b>anion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> in a simple, environmentally friendly manner. Different membrane properties and characterization methods are studied and implemented. The directions towards how to tune membrane properties specifically for RED are defined. For the first time, it was shown that tailor-made <b>anion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> were installed in a RED stack. Chapter 3 systematically investigates the bulk membrane properties of both a series of commercially available membranes and tailor-made membranes (both <b>anion</b> and cation <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes)</b> and correlates these to experimental RED performance data. The results set directions to decrease the area resistance rather than to improve permselectivity because area resistances of the membranes were found to be the dominant parameter regarding RED performance. In Chapter 4, the practical potential of monovalent ion selective <b>anion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> is investigated. As RED in natural conditions requires the use of natural seawater and river water, the presence of multivalent ions in the feed has a decreasing effect on the power output in RED. To prevent that, monovalent ion selective membranes were fabricated. Monovalent selectivity comparable to that of their commercially available counterparts membranes was achieved. Chapter 5 is dedicated to the fabrication of micro-structured membranes that eliminate the spacer shadow effect, which occurs when non-conductive spacers are used. They reduce the effective area of the membranes for ionic transport. To eliminate that, structured <b>anion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> having straight-ridge, wave or pillar structures were fabricated. Pillar-structured membranes were advantageous compared to the other types.

50|$|In an {{electrodialysis}} stack, the dilute (D) feed stream, brine or concentrate (C) stream, and electrode (E) stream {{are allowed}} to flow through the appropriate cell compartments formed by the ion exchange membranes. Under the influence of an electrical potential difference, the negatively charged ions (e.g., chloride) in the dilute stream migrate toward the positively charged anode. These ions pass through the positively charged <b>anion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membrane,</b> but are prevented from further migration toward the anode by the negatively charged cation exchange membrane and therefore stay in the C stream, which becomes concentrated with the anions. The positively charged species (e.g., sodium) in the D stream migrate toward the negatively charged cathode and pass through the negatively charged cation exchange membrane. These cations also stay in the C stream, prevented from further migration toward the cathode by the positively charged <b>anion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membrane.</b> As {{a result of the}} anion and cation migration, electric current flows between the cathode and anode. Only an equal number of anion and cation charge equivalents are transferred from the D stream into the C stream and so the charge balance is maintained in each stream.

50|$|The biggest {{challenge}} in developing AAEMFCs is the <b>anion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membrane</b> (AEM). A typical AEM {{is composed of}} a polymer backbone with tethered cationic ion-exchange groups to facilitate the movement of free OH− ions. This is the inverse of Nafion used for PEMFCs, where an anion is covalently attached to the polymer and protons hop from one site to another. The challenge is to fabricate AEM with high OH− ion conductivity and mechanical stability without chemical deterioration at elevated pH and temperatures. The main mechanisms of degradation are Hoffmann elimination when β-hydrogens are present and direct nucleophilic attack by OH− ion at the cationic site. One approach towards improving the chemical stability towards Hofmann elimination is to remove all β-hydrogens at the cationic site. All these degradation reactions limit the polymer backbone chemistries and the cations that can be incorporated for developing AEM.|$|E
50|$|Electrodialysis (ED) {{is used to}} {{transport}} salt ions from one solution through ion-exchange membranes to another solution {{under the influence of}} an applied electric potential difference.

In almost all practical electrodialysis processes, multiple electrodialysis cells are arranged into a configuration called an electrodialysis with alternating anion and cation exchange membranes forming the multiple electrodialysis cells. Electrodialysis processes are different from distillation techniques and other membrane based processes (such as reverse osmosis (RO)) in that dissolved species are moved away from the feed stream rather than the reverse. Because the quantity of dissolved species in the feed stream is far less than that of the fluid, electrodialysis offers the practical advantage of much higher feed recovery in many applications.|$|E

This difference in electronegativity inversely induces an electrophilic carbon center in the benzene ring, which can be attacked by the lone pair electron on the vanadium(V) oxygen species, further leading to the degradation of polymer backbone, while leaving the 4, 4 '-bipyridine ion exchange groups stable.

This MV/TEMPO system has the highest cell voltage, 1.25 V, and, possibly, lowest capital cost ($180/kWh) reported for AORFBs. The water-based liquid electrolytes were designed as a drop-in replacement for current systems without replacing existing infrastructure. A 600-milliwatt test battery was stable for 100 cycles with nearly 100 percent efficiency at current densities ranging from 20 to 100 mA per square centimeter, with optimal performance rated at 40-50 mA, at which about 70 percent of the battery's original voltage was retained. The significance of the research is that neutral AORFBs can be more environmentally friendly than acid or alkaline AORFBs while showing electrochemical performance comparable to corrosive acidic or alkaline RFBs. The MV/TEMPO AORFB has an energy density of 8.4 Wh/L with the limitation on the TEMPO side.

50|$|The {{alkaline}} {{fuel cell}} used by NASA in 1960s for Apollo and Space Shuttle program generated electricity at nearly 70% efficiency using aqueous solution of KOH as an electrolyte. In that situation, CO2 coming in through oxidant air stream and generated as by product from oxidation of methanol, if methanol is the fuel, reacts with electrolyte KOH forming CO32−/HCO3−. Unfortunately as a consequence, K2CO3 or KHCO3− precipitate on the electrodes. However, this effect has found to be mitigated by the removal of cationic counterions from the electrode, and carbonate formation {{has been found to}} be entirely reversible by several industrial and academic groups, most notably Varcoe. Low-cost CO2 systems have been developed using air as the oxidant source. In alkaline <b>anion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membrane</b> fuel cell, aqueous KOH is replaced with a solid polymer electrolyte membrane, that can conduct hydroxide ions. This could overcome the problems of electrolyte leakage and carbonate precipitation, though still taking advantage of benefits of operating a fuel cell in an alkaline environment. In AAEMFCs, CO2 reacts with water forming H2CO3, which further dissociate to HCO3− and CO32−. The equilibrium concentration of CO32−/HCO3− is less than 0.07% and there is no precipitation on the electrodes in the absence of cations (K+, Na+). The absence of cations is, however, difficult to achieve, as most membranes are conditioned to functional hydroxide or bicarbonate forms out of their initial, chemically stable halogen form, and may significantly impact fuel cell performance by both competitively adsorbing to active sites and exerting Helmholtz-layer effects.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{concentration}} polarization in electrodialytic desalination occurs due to mass transfer limitations within thin film layers adjacent to <b>anion</b> and cation <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes.</b> Each type of membrane behaves quite differently in electrodialysis. <b>Anion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> promote water ionization while cation <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> do not.

The properties of a series of quaternary ammonium-functionalized poly(phenylene oxide) and Radel-based AEMs were therefore examined to understand the reasons for increased resistance in AmB to overcome this performance penalty due to the lower mobility of bicarbonate, 4. 59 × 10 − 4 cm 2 /(V s), compared to chloride, 7. 90 × 10 − 4 cm 2 /(V s) (the dilute aqueous solution mobility ratio of HCO 3 − to Cl − is 0. 58). Most membrane resistances were generally consistent with the dilute solution mobilitie...|$|R

40|$|Reverse {{electrodialysis}} (RED) is {{a promising}} and potentially attractive {{technology for the}} generation of sustainable energy from the mixing of salt and fresh water. It uses the free energy of mixing two solutions of different salinity (e. g. river and sea water) to generate power. In RED, a concentrated salt solution and a less concentrated salt solution are brought into contact through an alternating series of <b>anion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> (AEM) and cation <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> (CEM). <b>Anion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> contain fixed positive charges which allow anions to permeate through the AEM towards the anode and cation <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> contain fixed negative charges which allow cations to be transported through the CEM towards the cathode. At the electrodes a redox couple is used to mitigate the transfer of electrons. The ion <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> {{are one of the}} key elements in the RED process as they, together with ion transport phenomena and concentration polarization effects occurring at the membrane-solution interface determine to a large extent the net power output of the system. This PhD thesis investigates the design, optimization and practical potential of the reverse electrodialysis process, with a special focus on membrane and spacer properties, mass transfer of the ionic species and concentration polarization phenomena. The results of this work show the high potential of RED as renewable energy source and it also brings RED closer to practical implementation...|$|R
