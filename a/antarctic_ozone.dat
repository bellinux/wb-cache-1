The weekly air pollution measurements are compared to equivalent measurements at Zeppelin. Ground measurements are taken of ozone and mercury, two of the greatest pollution threats in the polar regions.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a sensitivity analysis of multi-variate regressions of recent springtime <b>Antarctic</b> vortex <b>ozone</b> trends using a "big data" ensemble approach. Multi-variate regression methods {{are widely used}} for studying the variability and detection of ozone trends. Based on multi-variate regression analysis of total <b>Antarctic</b> springtime vortex <b>ozone</b> {{it has been suggested}} that the observed increase of ozone since the late 1990 s is statistically significant and can be attributed to decreasing stratospheric halogens (Salby et al., 2011, 2012; Kuttippurath et al., 2013). We find that, when considering uncertainties that have not been addressed in these studies, this conclusion on ozone recovery is not warranted. An ensemble of regressions is constructed based on the analysis of uncertainties in the applied ozone record as well as of uncertainties in the various applied regressors. The presented combination of ensemble members spans up the uncertainty range with about 35 million different regressions. The poleward heat flux (Eliassen–Palm Flux) and the effective chlorine loading explain, respectively, most of the short-term and long-term variability in different <b>Antarctic</b> springtime total <b>ozone</b> records. The inclusion in the regression of stratospheric volcanic aerosols, solar variability, the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode is shown to increase rather than to decrease the overall uncertainty in the attribution of <b>Antarctic</b> springtime <b>ozone</b> because of large uncertainties in their respective records. Calculating the trend significance for the ozone record from the late 1990 s onwards solely based on the fit of the effective chlorine loading should be avoided, as this does not take fit residuals into account and thereby results in too narrow uncertainty intervals. When taking fit residuals into account, we find that less than 30 % of the regressions in the full ensemble result in a statistically significant positive springtime ozone trend over Antarctica from the late 1990 s to either 2010 or 2012. Analysis of choices and uncertainties in time series show that, depending on choices in time series and parameters, the fraction of statistically significant trends in parts of the ensemble can range from negligible to more than 90 %. However, we were unable to detect a robust statistically significant positive trend in <b>Antarctic</b> springtime vortex <b>ozone</b> in the ensemble...|$|R
40|$|In 1987 the <b>Antarctic</b> springtime total <b>ozone</b> as {{measured}} by TOMS was substantially lower than in any previous year. Polar ozone levels began decreasing significantly after a mesoscale transient minimum developed over the Weddell Sea on September 5 - 7.

The lowest level observed was 109 DU on October 5 near the South Pole, a value 29 DU less than the 1985 previous record low.

40|$|Photochemical {{calculations}} along 'diabatic trajectories' in the meridional phase {{are used}} {{to search for the}} cause of the dramatic springtime minimum in <b>Antarctic</b> column <b>ozone.</b> The results indicate that the minimum is principally due to catalytic destruction of ozone by high levels of total odd nitrogen. Calculations suggest that these levels of odd nitrogen are transported within the polar vortex and during the polar night from the middle to upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere to the lower stratosphere. The possibility that these levels are related to the 11 -year solar cycle and are increased by enhanced formation in the thermosphere and mesosphere during solar maximum conditions is discussed...|$|R
25|$|The {{behavior}} {{seen in the}} <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> hole {{is completely}} different.

25|$|Increased solar {{ultraviolet}} radiation {{resulting from the}} <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> hole has reduced marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) {{by as much as}} 15% and has started damaging the DNA of some fish.

25|$|The <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> hole {{is an area}} of the Antarctic {{stratosphere}} {{in which}} the recent ozone levels have dropped to as low as 33 percent of their pre-1975 values.

Within this polar vortex, over 50 percent of the lower stratospheric ozone is destroyed during the Antarctic spring.|$|E
40|$|Garcia and Soloman (1987) {{have noted}} that the October monthly mean minimum total ozone amounts south of 30 S were {{modulated}} by a quasibiennial oscillation (QBO) signal. The precise mechanism behind this effect, however, is unclear.

Also, the QBO at mid-latitudes appears to be better correlated with the 30 -mbar tropical QBO winds than with those at 50 mbar. Possible mechanisms that would explain these phenomena are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The 1991 <b>Antarctic</b> springtime <b>ozone</b> decline, as {{measured}} by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), was similar to those of earlier deep ozone hole years, 1987, 1989, and 1990.

Four of the last five years have exhibited an extensive, deep ozone hole. The area of the hole was about the same as in 1987, 1989, and 1990. The recovery of the low total ozone values occurred in mid-November as the polar vortex broke up...|$|R
25|$|Reactions {{that take}} place on polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) play an {{important}} role in enhancing ozone depletion. PSCs form more readily in the extreme cold of the Arctic and Antarctic stratosphere. This is why ozone holes first formed, and are deeper, over Antarctica. Early models failed to take PSCs into account and predicted a gradual global depletion, which is why the sudden <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> hole was such a surprise to many scientists.|$|E
25|$|G.M.B. Dobson (Exploring the Atmosphere, 2nd Edition, Oxford, 1968) {{mentioned}} that when springtime ozone {{levels in the}} Antarctic over Halley Bay were first measured in 1956, {{he was surprised to}} find that they were ~320 DU, or about 150 DU below spring Arctic levels of ~450 DU. These were at that time the only known <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> values available. What Dobson describes is essentially the baseline from which the ozone hole is measured: actual ozone hole values are in the 150–100 DU range.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the latest}} {{study showed that}} the role of Mount Erebus volcano in the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> {{depletion}} was probably underestimated. Based on the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data over the last 35 years and by using the NOAA HYSPLIT trajectory model, researchers showed that Erebus volcano gas emissions (including hydrogen chloride (HCl)) can reach the Antarctic stratosphere via high-latitude cyclones and then the polar vortex. Depending on Erebus volcano activity, the additional annual HCl mass entering the stratosphere from Erebus varies from 1.0 to 14.3 kt.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by {{increased}} losses of <b>Antarctic</b> stratospheric <b>ozone</b> and by improved {{understanding of the}} mechanism, a concept is suggested for action to arrest this ozone loss: injecting the alkanes ethane or propane (E or P) into the Antarctic stratosphere.

The model results suggest that annual injections of about 50, 000 tons of E or P could suppress ozone loss, {{but there are some}} scenarios where smaller E or P injections could increase ozone depletion. Further, key uncertainties must be resolved, including initial concentrations of nitrogen-oxide species in austral spring, and several poorly defined physical and chemical processes must be quantified.

40|$|Simultaneous {{measurements}} of the atmospheric burdens of CH 4, N 2 O, CO 2, CF 2 Cl 2, and CO above McMurdo Station, Antarctica, have been derived from solar absorption spectra obtained by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory high-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer. In all cases the burdens are smaller than midlatitude values. Furthermore, retrievals of N 2 O and CH 4 indicate that the tropospheric mixing ratios were normal and that the depletion of the burdens can best {{be accounted for by}} a downward shift of the volume mixing ratio profiles by some 6 - 8 km. This rules out the possibility of large-scale upwelling of ozone-poor tropospheric air into the stratosphere being the cause of the <b>Antarctic</b> springtime <b>ozone</b> depletion...|$|R
25|$|The role of {{sunlight}} in ozone depletion {{is the reason}} why the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion is greatest during spring. During winter, even though PSCs are at their most abundant, there is no light over the pole to drive chemical reactions. During the spring, however, the sun comes out, providing energy to drive photochemical reactions and melt the polar stratospheric clouds, releasing considerable ClO, which drives the hole mechanism. Further warming temperatures near the end of spring break up the vortex around mid-December. As warm, ozone and -rich air flows in from lower latitudes, the PSCs are destroyed, the enhanced ozone depletion process shuts down, and the ozone hole closes.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Government's {{attitude}} {{began to}} change again in 1983, when William Ruckelshaus replaced Anne M. Burford as Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Under Ruckelshaus and his successor, Lee Thomas, the EPA pushed for an international approach to halocarbon regulations. In 1985 20 nations, including {{most of the major}} CFC producers, signed the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, which established a framework for negotiating international regulations on ozone-depleting substances. That same year, the discovery of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> hole was announced, causing a revival in public attention to the issue. In 1987, representatives from 43 nations signed the Montreal Protocol. Meanwhile, the halocarbon industry shifted its position and started supporting a protocol to limit CFC production. However, this shift was uneven with DuPont acting more quickly than their European counterparts. DuPont may have feared court action related to increased skin cancer especially as the EPA had published a study in 1986 claiming that an additional 40 million cases and 800,000 cancer deaths were to be expected in the U.S. in the next 88 years. The EU shifted its position as well after Germany gave up its defence of the CFC industry and started supporting moves towards regulation. Government and industry in France and the UK tried to defend their CFC producing industries even after the Montreal Protocol had been signed.|$|E

40|$|Two {{years of}} ozone {{measurements}} (1996, 1997), sorted {{according to the}} analysed potential vorticity over Dumont d’Urville (66 °S), are presented. Subsidence in the vortex was observed by tracing the descent of the ozone maximum. Chemical depletion was also observed. In springtime, the ozone mixing ratio was reduced by a factor 10 on isentropes between about 400 K and 475 K. Using the observations of descent and depletion, it is shown that, at the latitude of Dumont d’Urville, chemical depletion starts close to mid-winter. Depletion starts earlier at higher altitudes (above 450 K) than at lower altitudes (below 450 K). The earlier presence of Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSCs) at higher altitudes than at lower altitudes is a likely reason.

40|$|We use {{observations}} of N 2 O and mean age to identify realistic transport in models {{in order to}} explain their ozone predictions. The results are applied to 15 chemistry climate models (CCMs) participating in the 2010 World Meteorological Organization ozone assessment. Comparison of the observed and simulated N 2 O, mean age and their compact correlation identifies models with fast or slow circulations and reveals details of model ascent and tropical isolation. This process‐oriented diagnostic is more useful than mean age alone because it identifies models with compensating transport deficiencies that produce fortuitous agreement with mean age. The diagnosed model transport behavior is related to a model’s ability to produce realistic lower stratosphere (LS) O 3 profiles. Models with the greatest tropical transport problems compare poorly with O 3 observations. Models with the most realistic LS transport agree more closely with LS observations and each other. We incorporate {{the results of the}} chemistry evaluations in the Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate (SPARC) CCMVal Report to explain the range of CCM predictions for the return‐to‐ 1980 dates for global (60 °S– 60 °N) and <b>Antarctic</b> column <b>ozone.</b> <b>Antarctic</b> O 3 return dates are generally correlated with vortex Cly levels, and vortex Cly is generally correlated with the model’s circulation, although model Cl chemistry and conservation problems also {{have a significant effect on}} return date.
