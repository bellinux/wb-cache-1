This is, there are consumption externalities and the variable cost of the drug exceeds the alternative’s. Contrarily, if the firm can commit to a price before reimbursement, a strategic effect implies that by setting a sufficiently high price, the firm can make the agency more willing to reimburse than without commitment...|$|R

Alternatively, if the firm can commit to a price in advance of the reimbursement decision, we identify a strategic effect which implies that by committing to a high price ex ante, the firm can force a listing outcome and make the agency more willing to reimburse than in the absence of commitment...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{allocation}} of environmental remediation costs to Department of Defense (DOD) contracts. Environmental remediation costs are incurred {{in the current period}} to cleanup contamination resulting from the performance of work in the past. Consequently, there is little direct beneficial or causal relationship between DOD's current contracts and the costs incurred. Yet, the manner in which remediation costs are allocated will substantially determine who pays for the rising costs of yesterday's contamination. Background material is presented to illustrate Government cost accounting practices and DOD guidance on environmental costs. Research material was obtained from the Congress, the General Accounting Office, DOD, defense contractors and industry associations. The research concludes that none of the current allocation methods are consistently fair and equitable. <b>Any</b> <b>reimbursement</b> for DOD's share of cleanup costs should be made independently of the contract cost accounting system.

Assessing this value requires consideration of research costs, research time, and what happens to patients while the research is undertaken and after completion. The investigators describe a development of the calculation of the expected value of sample information that assesses the value of investing in further research, including an only-in-research strategy and an only-with-research strategy...|$|R

This study examined the impact of evidence, process and context factors on CVZ decisions in 2004 – 2009. A data set of CVZ decisions pertaining to pharmaceutical technologies was created, including 29 variables extracted from published information. A three-category outcome variable was used, defined as the decision to ‘recommend’, ‘restrict’ or ‘not recommend’ a technology. Technologies included in list 1 A/ 1 B or on the expensive drug list were considered recommended; those included in list 2 or for which patient co-payment is required were considered restricted; technologies not included on <b>any</b> <b>reimbursement</b> list were classified as ‘not recommended’. Using multinomial logistic regression, the relative contribution of explanatory variables on CVZ decisions was assessed. In all, 244 technology appraisals (256 technologies) were analysed, with 51 %, of technologies recommended, 33 % restricted and 16 % not recommended by CVZ for funding. The multinomial model showed significant associations (p ≤ 0. 10) between CVZ outcome and several variables, including: (1) use of an active comparator and demonstration of statistical superiority of the primary endpoint in clinical trials, (2) pharmaceutical budget impact associated with introduction of the technology, (3) therapeutic indication and (4) prevalence of the target population.

40|$|Compression is {{the most}} {{effective}} treatment to promote skin ulcer healing, although there are as many different methods of performing a leg compression as the number of phlebologists, each one having personal tricks, solutions, habits. Conversely, though dressings may be done in different ways, none is considered the standard solution. We asked few (18) questions to physicians involved in this field, in Italy and abroad, looking for some common feature. The analysis of 100 replies indicated the average treatment: compression made by multilayer bandage when edema is present, knee long stocking when edema is removed, mostly based on patient’s agreement. Escharectomy should be done when ulcer bed is covered by necrotic tissue. Advanced wound care is used, with dressing changed several times a week. For highly exuding ulcers, a specific dressing is used or frequent changing is performed. The treatment in early stage of disease is done by the physician while subsequently the dressings may be performed by the patient himself, nurses or doctors. Usually no medical treatments are associated. The cost of a single dressing is often lower than 10 Euro, without <b>any</b> <b>reimbursement.</b> The compression devices aren’t reimbursed as well. The expected compression pressure is 30 / 40 mm Hg. Daytime compression is not reduced at night-time. The patient is always invited to walk. The same compression is used if the ABPI is < 1.

40|$|Systematic {{literature}} {{reviews of}} health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQoL) evidence that are to inform economic models can be challenging due to the volume of hits identified in searches using generic terms for HRQoL. Nevertheless, a robust {{review of the literature}} is required to ensure that the health state utility values (HSUVs) used in the economic model are the most appropriate available. This article provides a synopsis of literature relating to identifying, reviewing and synthesising HSUVs. The process begins with scoping the needs of the economic model, including the definitions of health states and the requirements of <b>any</b> <b>reimbursement</b> agencies. A sequence of searches may be required as the economic model evolves. The terminology used for HRQoL measures may be problematic, and as there is no robust HRQoL filter [equivalent to that applied for randomised control trial (RCTs) ], sifting the results of sensitive searches can be resource intensive. Alternative approaches such as forward and backward citation searches may reduce the resources required, while maintaining the integrity of the search. Any included studies should be assessed in terms of quality using a recommended checklist, and insufficient detail in the primary studies should be noted as a short-coming in this exercise. Subject to homogeneity (similar populations, same measure and preference weights) evidence can be pooled in some way, although methodological research into the appropriateness of alternative techniques for meta-analysis is in its infancy. Reporting standards are key and as a minimum should include details on searches, inclusion/exclusion criteria (together with rationale for exclusion at each stage), assessment of quality and relevance of included studies, and justification for the choice of final HSUVs. ...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} the number of patients treated with antiretroviral agents purchased from community-based, private chemists and to assess the global reimbursement costs for the general scheme of the French health insurance fund. Method: We performed a cross-sectional survey by using reimbursement data from the general scheme of the French health insurance fund stricto sensu. We enrolled all patients who were reimbursed for at least one antiretroviral agent they had purchased from a city-based, private chemist during the last quarter of 2000. Results: We enrolled a total of 11, 890 patients whose average age was 39. 5 years. The male-female sex ratio was 2. 7. Nearly all the patients (96, 3 %) were waived from co-payments since their illness figured on the list of long-term disorders which are reimbursed 100 % by the healthfund. One-half of the patients did not file <b>any</b> <b>reimbursement</b> request for a hospitalization during the year 2000. The healthfund reimbursed an average of 12, 404 euros per patient over the year including 8, 263 euros for medications. Average expenditures for patients receiving antiretroviral agents were nearly 11 times the expenditures for the average beneficiary in the general population. Medication costs for these patients were 39 times more than in the population in general. Conclusion: This type of easily reproducible study can enable the healthfund to carefully follow changes in care related to HIVpositive patients, particularly with respect to the out-patient medications they purchase. These data can be complemented by data from mandatory HIV reporting as well as from information concerning patients receiving in-patient hospital care. The development of a drug-coding system for medications delivered by hospitals will eventually enable us to follow the entire population of patients treated with antiretroviral drugs in France...|$|R
5000|$|Traditional Arab society, {{which is}} clan-based, {{strongly}} adheres {{to the concept}} of collective responsibility. Bedouins recognize two main forms of penalty for a crime against a member. These are blood revenge, referred to as Qisas (قصا, [...] "revenge") and blood money, Diyya (دية, [...] "blood money"/"ransom"). In cases of severe crimes such as murder and rape, blood revenge is the proscribed punishment. If a murder occurs, clansmen of the victim have the right to kill the murderer or one of his male clansmen with impunity. Certain crimes are liable for multiple acts of revenge, for example, the murder of women and children is avenged fourfold. Crimes considered treacherous, such as the murder of a guest, are also avenged fourfold. Alternatively, a crime punishable by blood revenge can be commuted to a severe fine if the family of the offended party agrees to it. Blood money is paid jointly by the clan of the offending member to the clan of the victimized member. Bedouins differentiate between crimes in which the group must pay as a standing obligation without reimbursement from the perpetrator of the offense, and crimes where the latter must reimburse them. Crimes where the clan is obligated to pay a joint fee without <b>any</b> <b>reimbursement</b> are murder, violent assault, or insults and other offenses committed during a violent conflict. The collective payment of fines for such crimes is viewed as a justified contribution to the welfare of the injured party, rather than a penalty to the perpetrator. Other offenses given a blood-price are crimes against property and crimes against honor. Concepts based on the Arabian laws of blood revenge and blood money are found in Islamic Sharia law, and are thus variously adhered to in Islamic states.|$|R
