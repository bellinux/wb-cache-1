40|$|Abstract-The {{objective}} {{in this paper}} is to present some recent advances for the finite element analysis of automobile structures. These advances pertain to the development of effective basic finite element procedures and the efficient solution of large systems of equations. With these new procedures, it is possible to model much more accurately (and reliably) the actual nonlinear physical behavior of complex structures. The illustrative solutions given in the paper include the solution of a roof-crush problem that was solved appropriately, according to the <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>situation,</b> using implicit time integration (resulting practically in a static analysis). 0 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. 1...|$|E

Secondly, the results of a numerical calculation using a double spacestep and varying timestep in the Lax-Wendroff scheme are analysed. The effect of the external magnetic field on plasma parameters such as : plasma velocity, ion temperature, electron temperature and plasma density is analysed. The experimental results [1] are compared with theory and are found to be in good agreement especially for the later times of the compression stage. At one stage, the plasma column radius is greater than the corresponding one for the case with no magnetic field. All the calculations are performed for a deuterium gas compression...|$|E

Keywords Virtual reality, task analysis, exposure therapy, phobias INTRODUCTION Phobias are {{the most common form of}} anxiety disorders, which themselves are the most common psychiatric disorders. Phobias can often be treated effectively using exposure therapy. This involves subjecting the patient to anxiety-producing stimuli while allowing the anxiety to attenuate. These stimuli have traditionally been generated by presenting the patient with <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>situations</b> (In Vivo) or by having the patient imagine the stimulus.

40|$|In {{order to}} get some insight in {{the intricacies of the}} Abraham-Minkowski energy-momentum problem in phenomenological electrodynamics, we briefly analyze eight {{different}} experimental situations in radiation optics. Six of the experiments are already existing, while the remaining two are suggestions for future endeavors. Among the first six, we distinguish between three which are incapable of informing about photon momentum in a medium, and the remaining three which are able to give us useful information. Our general conclusion is that the Abraham-Minkowski "problem" is essentially a matter of convenience. In <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>situations</b> it is the Minkowski expression which is most natural alternative to employ. Also, in a canonical context, it is the Minkowski energy-momentum tensor which is the most convenient alternative to work with, as this tensor is divergence-free causing the total radiation momentum and energy to make up a four-vector, although notably a spacelike one.

For these reasons, several methods for finding a radius of convergence are given. We will prove all results in this thesis...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an operational}} {{approach to the}} use of pulsating sources, located at spatial infinity, for defining a relativistic positioning and navigation system, based on the use of null four-vectors in a flatMinkowskian spacetime. We describe our approach and discuss the validity of it and of the other approximations we have considered in <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>situations.</b> As a prototypical case, we show how pulsars can be used to define such a positioning system: the reception of the pulses for a set of different sources whose positions in the sky and periods are assumed to be known allows the determination of the user's coordinates and spacetime trajectory, in the reference frame where the sources are at rest. In order to confirm the viability of the method, we consider an application example reconstructing the world-line of an idealized Earth in the reference frame of distant pulsars: in particular we have simulated the arrival times of the signals fromfour pulsars at the location of the Parkes radiotelescope in Australia. After pointing out the simplifications we have made, we discuss the accuracy of the method. Eventually, we suggest that the method could actually be used for navigation across the Solar System and be based on artificial sources, rather than pulsar...|$|R
40|$|Electron-electron correlation, {{excitation}} and quantum interference {{are generally}} important in attosecond physics, especially for imaging of atoms and molecules. These {{are the main}} topics addressed in this thesis, {{in the context of}} laser-induced nonsequential double ionization (NSDI). Excitation is the most extensive topic of this work and is addressed within a rigorous, semi-analytic study of the recollision-excitation with subsequent tunneling ionization (RESI) mechanism in laser-induced nonsequential double ionization (NSDI). This is the most comprehensive study of this mechanism performed {{in the context of the}} strong-field approximation to the preset date. Subsequently, we investigate potential imaging applications, by computing electron momentum distributions of atoms and molecules. For atoms, we show that the RESI electron momentum distributions depends very critically on the bound state wave function. For molecules, we address the influence of the molecular orbital geometry and of the molecular alignment with respect to the laser-field polarization, by computing the electron momentum distributions of N 2 and Li 2. We show that the electron-momentum distributions exhibit interference maxima and minima, either due to the electron emission at spatially separated centers, or to the orbital geometry, such as nodes of the atomic wavefunction. In this latter case, we do not restrict ourself only to RESI, and we also compute the electron momentum distributions of N 2 for electron-impact ionization, in which we also observe two-center interference patterns when the molecule is aligned along the laserfield polarization direction. The above-mentioned momentum constraints, together with the strong dependence of the distributions on the bound states involved, the molecular orbital geometry and the molecular alignment angle may be important for singling out the RESI mechanism in <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>situations</b> and using NSDI in ultra-fast imaging. In the final chapter, we present the first step taken by us in order to address the above-stated issues using an approach beyond the strong field approximation...|$|R
40|$|A {{generalized}} formulation {{is given}} for treating partial redistribution effects in transfer problems in resonance lines with common upper states. The formulation allows explicitly {{for the possibility}} that several spectral lines may arise in transitions from a given upper level to several sharp lower levels, including, for example, the ground state and metastable states. Line profiles for the Ca II H and K lines have been calculated, accounting for the partial frequency coherence of scattered photons. These profiles are compared with calculations made with identical atomic and atmospheric models but assuming complete redistribution. Very significant differences between the profiles obtained using these two different physical descriptions of the scattering process are found, and it is now apparent that the assumption of complete redistribution is a serious oversimplification of the <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>situation.</b> The results question the validity of equating brightness temperatures observed at K(sub 1) in stellar spectra with minimum temperatures in stellar chromospheres; it appears likely that such a procedure will systematically underestimate the value of T-min...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new algorithm to generate interior nodes within any arbitrary multi-connected regions. The boundary nodes {{and the interior}} nodes are then linked up to form the best possible triangular elements by a completely revised technique in an efficient and stable manner. Owing to the generality of the central generation program, the global domain is allowed to be divided into as many irregular subdomains as desired, in order to model closely the <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>situation.</b> Moreover, {{the boundaries of the}} sub-domains are updated from time to time when necessary to include the possibilities of progressive refinement around a sharp corner, generating radiating mesh from a prescribed node, generating mesh between two circular arcs, etc. Despite its flexibility and capabilities, data for triangulation have been kept to a minimum by a logical input module; no connectivity information between subregions is needed, and common boundaries are defined once only. All these features have contributed to a powerful method to generate 3 -node or 6 -node triangular element meshes of great variety within the most irregular heterogeneous regions. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} general {{evolution}} of spherical over-densities for thawing class of dark energy models. We model dark energy with scalar fields having canonical {{as well as}} non-canonical kinetic energy. For non-canonical case, we consider models where the kinetic energy is of the Born-Infeld Form. We study various potentials like linear, inverse-square, exponential as well as PNGB-type. We also consider the case when dark energy is homogeneous {{as well as the}} case when it is inhomogeneous and virializes together with matter. Our study shows that models with linear potential in particular with Born-Infeld type kinetic term can have significant deviation from the Î›CDM model in terms of density contrast at the time of virialization. Although our approach is a simplified one to study the nonlinear evolution of matter overdensities inside the cluster and is not applicable to <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>situation,</b> it gives some interesting insights into the nonlinear clustering of matter in the presence of thawing class of dark energy models.

A simplified analytical model is formulated to understand the physical behaviour of the plasma arc.

For single component, closed thermodynamic systems a detailed exposition is given which establishes a clear connection between the degeneracy and the scalar curvature of the Weinhold metric (Journal of Chemical Physcis, I-V, vol 63) and physical properties such as phase transition and non-ideal inter-particle interactions. Compelling evidence for the relationship is provided by several specific applications. These include the Ideal gas, the van der Waals and the Berthelot gases.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the chemical kinetics databases used to simulate the behavior of combustion systems. The individual elements are the rate expressions for the various reactions. At a fundamental level there are only unimolecular and bimolecular reactions. We will be concerned with the former and the proper way to describe these processes. In most databases these are expressed in the Arrhenius or modified Arrhenius form. This may not be correct since the implication is that the molecules are in a Boltzmann distribution. This can only be achieved if there are sufficient collisions to thermalize the reacting molecule. We consider in this presentation the case where two molecular entities form an excited adduct which can then decompose through various channels. The situation is particularly important for cases of the attack of oxygen molecules on a fuel radical during fuel oxidation and for the combination of unsaturated species during PAH/SOOT formation. The proper treatment of such reactions are well understood but has been largely neglected in existing database. We demonstrate the situation for the specific cases of oxygen molecule attack on n-propyl radical and H-atom formation as a consequence of methyl radical addition to benzyl, naphthy and phenathrenyl. The consequence is that all these processes have pressure dependences, For the aromatic compounds it appears that increasing molecular size does not necessarily help to thermalize the molecule. The conclusion is that for these general classes of reaction existing databases do not reflect the <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>situation...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} sample of 654 radio quasars seen in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and the ROSAT point source {{catalogue}} and study their broad band properties. The size of this list allows a statistically significant investigation of the soft X-ray properties of various subgroups distinguished by their radio properties. It is found that flat spectrum and steep spectrum quasars have slightly different X-ray properties which can be understood {{in the frame of}} a two component model for the emission: A beamed flat spectral component which is more dominant in flat radio spectrum objects and a steep more isotropic soft component. Combinations of these two components lead to the observed correlations of the X-ray spectral slope with the radio spectral properties, with the core dominance and radio loudness of the objects, and with redshift. Various correlations exist between the radio, optical, and X-ray properties of the sources. Flat spectrum quasars are X-ray louder than steep spectrum objects, the X-ray loudness does not evolve with redshift, and the apparent dependence of #alpha#_o_x on the optical luminosity seem to be due to biases inherent to the data. Simple proportionalities between the luminosities in the different wavelength bands appear to be inappropriate descriptions of the <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>situation</b> as they do not account for the varying contributions of the core and extended emission in the objects, i. e., the relative fraction of the beamed core to the unbeamed extended radio emission. Both components contribute in all energy bands but the physical processes governing these complex relations are not yet understood. Finally, redshift dependencies and selection effects influence the correlations as well, leading to deviations from a simple linear relation between the measured quantities in many cases. (orig.)

40|$|Physical {{processes}} obey {{one or more}} conservation laws. Engineers {{and scientists}} have derived by manipulation of these conservation laws differential equations which govern many physical systems. These differential equations are either elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic in form. State-of-the-art numerical methods accurately approximate the solutions of elliptic and parabolic differential equations, but difficulties arise when approximating the solutions of many hyperbolic differential systems which describe certain convection dominated physical phenomena. The finite element method for the solution of partial differential equations is given a physical interpretation for potential flow problems, heat flow problems, and mass conservation problems. The differential equations describing these systems represent elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic differential systems. The finite element model of the mass conservation law is modified using physical interpretations to represent an analog of the upstream weighted finite difference method. From these physical interpretations, a method for modeling single phase multi-component areal flow in a porous media is developed for both incompressible and compressible flow. This method models only the convective mass transfer, since {{the magnitude of the}} numerical diffusion added by the method is expected to be far greater than the magnitude of the physical diffusion present in the <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> <b>situation.</b> This method represents a novel idea in taking a mass balance over a computational molecule which differs from the computational molecule that is employed in the finite difference method with upstream weighting. This finite element computational molecule is a region in R(' 3) defined by a basis element for the bilinear splines in R(' 2). This method has several nice properties. The method exhibits a maximum principle, and is easily implemented in state-of-the-art numerical models of fluid flow in a porous media. The method is computationally fast. The grid orientation which is present in the finite difference method does not appear in this model. The compositional profiles generated by this method are similar to the compositional profiles generated by a finite element method which converges to the true solution of the unit mobility ratio incompressible miscible displacement problem...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} measure the level of <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> activity of patients with end-stage OA of the hip and the knee, to compare this with that of matched healthy controls, and to analyze the data in order to ascertain the factors of influence. MethodThe <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> activity was measured with an activity monitor (AM) in 40 hip and 44 knee OA patients, and compared with measurements obtained from healthy controls. Data were also collected on pain and psychological aspects as anxiety, depression and mental functioning. The primary outcome parameter of the <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> activity was the percentage of movement-related activity. ResultsThe percentage of movement-related activity did not differ between the two OA groups. It was 8. 8 (4. 2) % for the hip and 8. 1 (3. 8) % for the knee OA patients. The matched controls were significantly higher movement-related active than OA patients (about 11. 0 (2. 9) %). Increasing age and body mass index were negatively associated with the percentage of movement-related activity (Î²=âˆ’ 0. 29 and Î²=âˆ’ 0. 25, respectively), whereas mental functioning was positively related (Î²= 0. 30). ConclusionThe impact of end-stage OA on the level of <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> activity is equal for hip and knee OA patients. The <b>actual</b> <b>physical</b> activity for both of the OA groups was significantly and clinically relevantly lower compared to controls. However, this difference was smaller than expected and less dominant than patients' perception of limitations in daily life.
