40|$|The {{process by}} which liquid cloud {{droplets}} homogeneously crystallize into ice is still not well understood. The ice nucleation process based on the standard and classical theory of homogeneous freezing initiates within the interior volume of a cloud droplet. Current experimental data on homogeneous freezing rates of ice in droplets of supercooled water, both in <b>air</b> and <b>emulsion</b> <b>oil</b> samples, show considerable scatter. For example, at − 33 °C, the reported volume-based freezing rates of ice in supercooled water vary {{by as many as}} 5 orders of magnitude, which is well outside the range of measurement uncertainties. Here, we show that the process of ice nucleus formation at the <b>air</b> (or <b>oil)</b> -liquid water interface may help to explain why experimental results on ice nucleation rates yield different results in different ambient phases. Our results also suggest that surface crystallization of ice in cloud droplets can explain why low amounts of supercooled water have been observed in the atmosphere near − 40 °C...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} soybean <b>oil</b> <b>emulsion</b> and oral or enteral administration of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on stress response, cytokine production, protein metabolism, and immune function after surgery for esophageal cancer. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: It {{has been reported that}} safflower oil, rich in n- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n- 6 PUFA), affects the survival rate of septic animals and decreases the immune function. It has also been reported that the administration of fish oil, in contrast, reduces these stress responses and stress-induced immunosuppression. In humans, the effects of soybean <b>oil</b> <b>emulsion</b> and the administration of EPA on stress response and immune function after surgery have not been established. METHODS: Patients who underwent esophagectomy with thoracotomy were divided into three groups. Seven patients were fed by total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with soybean <b>oil</b> <b>emulsion,</b> which accounted for 20 % of total calories. Seven patients were given oral or enteral administration of 1. 8 g/day EPA, in addition to TPN with soybean <b>oil</b> <b>emulsion.</b> Nine patients served as the control group; these patients received fat-free TPN. Serum interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), C-reactive protein, concanavalin A (con A) - or phytohemagglutinin (PHA) -stimulated lymphocyte proliferation, natural killer cell activity, and stress hormones were measured. RESULTS: The postoperative level of serum IL- 6 was significantly higher in the group receiving soybean <b>oil</b> <b>emulsion</b> than in the fat-free group. Oral or enteral supplementation of EPA with soybean <b>oil</b> <b>emulsion</b> significantly reduced the level of serum IL- 6 compared with the patients receiving soybean <b>oil</b> <b>emulsion.</b> Con A- or PHA-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation decreased significantly on postoperative day 7 in all groups of patients.

40|$|AbstractResearch on {{rheological}} behavior of crude <b>oil</b> <b>emulsion</b> is vital due to complex behavior of crude oil. Usually, crude <b>oil</b> <b>emulsion</b> {{is found in}} mixed state with solid particles, organic additives and emulsifying agents. Crude <b>oil</b> <b>emulsion</b> can be encountered during oil production, transporting or processing. The production of emulsion is a costly problem {{both in terms of}} chemicals usage to overcome the problem and production loses. In order to get a better understanding on rheological behaviour of crude <b>oil</b> <b>emulsion,</b> the rheological study of water in <b>oil</b> <b>emulsion</b> was investigated. The present paper deals with the rheological study of light crude oil from Bintulu, Sarawak and its mixture with water. This rheological study includes viscosity dependence vs. shear rate, temperature and volume water ratio. Water in <b>oil</b> <b>emulsions</b> were prepared by mixing light crude oil with different water volume fractions (20 %, 30 % and 40 %). Rheological measurements were carried out by Antoon Paar MCR 301 rheometer operated at pressure of 2. 5 bar. The results showed that emulsion exhibit non-Newtonian flow behavior at low shear rate and Newtonian flow behaviour at high shear rate. Besides that, viscosity of water in <b>oil</b> <b>emulsion</b> was strongly augmented by increasing volume of water and decreased the temperature. It was noted that a large discontinuity in the viscosity occurs at volume water ratio of 30 to 40 %. In the case of 100 % light crude oil, the study demonstrated Newtonian behavior. However, for emulsion with different volume water ratios, the rheological studies follow non-Newtonian shear thinning behavior and were described in better way by Ostwald de Waele and Herschel-Bulkley models. As a conclusion, rheological study shows that temperature, shear rate and volume water ratio have great impacts on the viscosity of water in <b>oil</b> <b>emulsion</b> and {{it is important to understand}} these factors to avoid various costly problems...|$|R

Two realistic scenarios are considered.

A detailed kinetic PSR modelling study is performed for combustion conditions relevant both to cement kiln and precalciner operating conditions. It is demonstrated that, although NOx emissions from the precalciner are generally substantially lower than those from the cement kiln, emulsion injection in the latter appears to be favourable and can lead up to 50 % reductions in NO levels. However, injection of cutting <b>oil</b> <b>emulsion</b> with relatively high nitrogen content in the precalciner may lead, under lean conditions, to increases in the emitted NO levels.

Drop breakage occurs when the emulsion is flowed through a small gap between rotor and stator under laminar shear conditions. In this paper, we have developed the first full population balance equation (PBE) model for colloid mills and used the model to better understand the relevant drop breakage mechanisms. The PBE model accounted for both drop breakage and coalescence and generated predictions of the drop size distribution after each pass of the emulsion through the colloid mill. Drops were assumed to break due to capillary instability with the distribution of drop sizes resulting from each breakage event studied in detail. A viscosity model was developed to predict the emulsion viscosity as function of the oil fraction and the high shear rates commonly used. Nonlinear optimization was used to estimate adjustable parameters in the breakage and coalescence functions to minimize the least-squares difference between predicted and measured drop size distributions for high oil-to-surfactant emulsions. We concluded that experimentally observed drop volume distributions could not be predicted with daughter drop distribution functions reported in the literature.

The model was initialized with typical vertical density and velocity profiles in the De Soto Canyon (CARTHE GLAD experimental range) located in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. The effect of <b>oil</b> <b>emulsions</b> on DVM was included by altering the molecular viscosity of water in the upper layer of the ocean. The freshwater lenses were simulated as localized (in space) salinity and temperature anomalies, propagating as gravity currents, eventually mixing with the environment and increasing the vertical stratification. The model results suggest that propulsion speed of some organisms may somewhat change because of buoyancy effects due to varying salinity stratification in the upper layer of the ocean; the presence of <b>oil</b> <b>emulsions,</b> however, can have a more dramatic effect on the DVM of zooplankton (with dire consequences for the marine ecosystem) ...|$|R
