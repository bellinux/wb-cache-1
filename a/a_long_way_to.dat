5|$|German close {{air support}} also began to take its toll, forcing units such as the Soviet 38th Army onto the defensive. It ranged over the front, {{operating}} dangerously close to the changing frontline. Air interdiction and direct ground support damaged Soviet supply lines and rear areas, also inflicting large losses on their armoured formations. General Franz Halder remarked the air attacks went <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> breaking the Soviet offensive. The Soviet air force could do very little to stop these air attacks. Not only did the Luftwaffe attack the enemy, it also carried out vital supply missions. Bombers dropped supplies to encircled German units, which could continue to hold out until a counter-offensive relieved them. Over {{the course of the}} 16-day battle the German 6th Air Corps {{played a major role in}} the German victory, conducting 15,648 sorties (978 per day), dropping 7,700 tons of bombs on the Soviet forces and lifting 1,545 tons of material to the front.|$|E
5|$|Tanahashi next tried a Rainmaker, which Okada {{countered with}} one of his own and scored a nearfall. Although Okada {{attempted}} the Rainmaker three more times, Tanahashi countered with a bridging straitjacket German suplex, a bridging dragon suplex, a series of dragon-screw legwhips, and three High Fly Flows. The first was a crossbody while Okada was on the ropes; the second a frog splash to a seated Okada, and the third another frog splash, after which Tanahashi scored a pinfall on Okada to retain the title at 30 minutes and 57 seconds. Okada wept as he left the ring, and Tanahashi shouted that his opponent had <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> go before becoming the New Japan ace. Tanahashi closed the show, thanking the fans and performing his air guitar routine.|$|E

His achievements were not to last long after his disappearance from history in c. 1280, however. In Euboea, Licario's major gain and personal fief, the Byzantine forts were gradually retaken by the Lombards, until they recovered the entire island by 1296.|$|E

25|$|Sussex won the toss at the Oval {{and elected}} to bat. Mark Ramprakash captained Surrey as Mark Butcher {{has still not}} {{recovered}} from the injury that saw him miss England's winter tour. Only 49 overs could be bowled on the first day, as rain delayed the start till after lunch, and bad light brought an early conclusion. Cloud cover helped the bowlers, but Sussex, thanks to Michael Yardy's 44 not out, finished the day on 171 for 4. The second day saw 61 overs. Yardy, again under cloud-covered skies, progressed to 111, which will have gone <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> helping him cement a regular first team place.

25|$|Given {{the local}} {{reputation}} {{and respect for}} Hobbs senior, a local committee formed {{to raise money to}} support his family.

Hobbs assumed his father's duties as groundsman at Jesus college in the winter of 1902–03. While working there, one of his colleagues and a friend of his father, F. C. Hutt, got in contact with Hayward to ask him to arrange a trial for Hobbs, with a view to joining Surrey. Consequently, in late 1902, Hayward and Bill Reeves, an Essex cricketer born in Cambridge, bowled at Hobbs on Parker's Piece and he impressed Hayward. Hobbs and Hutt were not certain that anything would come of this, and Hutt wrote to Essex asking for a trial, but the county never replied.|$|E
