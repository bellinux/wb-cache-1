5|$|The Chamber of Deputies (1) expresses disapproval {{with the}} European Commission {{proposal}} {{to limit the}} possibility of <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> possession of firearms that are held legally in line with national laws of EU Member States, (2) refuses European Commission's infringement into a well established system of control, evidence, <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> possession of firearms and ammunition laid down by the Czech law, (3) expresses support for establishment of any and all functional measures to combat illegal trade, acquisition, possession and other illegal manipulation with firearms, ammunition and explosives, (4) refuses European Commission's persecution of Member States and their citizens through unjustified tightening of legal firearms possession {{as a reaction to}} terror attacks in Paris and (5) recommends the Prime Minister to conduct any and all legal and diplomatic steps to prevent enactment of a directive that would disrupt the Czech legal order in the area of trade, control, <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> possession of firearms and thus inappropriately infringe into the rights of the citizens of the Czech Republic.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes {{issues related}} with management of merger & acquisition projects. There are several publications and articles related to mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions</b> in the Czech Republic but {{they focus on}} subareas (accounting, tax or legal implications). Intention of {{the author of the}} dissertation is to present comprehensive view at mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions</b> <b>and</b> compose recommendations for managers who will be responsible for future merger <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> projects. The dissertation contain analysis of experiences from past <b>acquisition</b> projects <b>and</b> analysis of elements which influence merger <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> projects. Another part focuses on merger <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> structuring <b>and</b> description of important parts of any acquisition project. Author sent questionnaire to Crowe Horwath International firms and executed assessment of responses related to questions from mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions.</b> Outcome of the dissertation contain model of five stages recommended to merger <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> projects, resources for creating value during mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions,</b> limitation of mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions</b> <b>and</b> reasons for merger <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> decisions. For better explanation are numerous examples, case studies and charts used in particular sections...|$|R

40|$|There are {{numerous}} researches which analyze mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions,</b> {{but most of}} them do not focus on a certain industry, but their sample considers companies from different industries. This paper focuses on mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions</b> in the pharmaceutical industry. It is assumed that pharmaceutical companies with no experience in mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions</b> achieve better results in relatively small and domestic mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions</b> while pharmaceutical companies with greater experience in mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions</b> are successful even in bigger and international mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions.</b> Bigger mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions</b> <b>and</b> international mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions</b> are more risky for the companies so lack of experience in mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions</b> additionally increases risks during the process of mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions.</b> On average, such increase of the risk results in lower returns for stock owners of pharmaceutical companies...|$|R
5|$|After having {{positioned}} {{to perform a}} visual inspection, the robot performs an acquisition with a pan-tilt-zoom camera. Several steps take place: pointing the camera, sensing the element to be inspected, if needed repointing and zooming with the camera, image <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> inspection. Image analysis is used on doors {{to determine whether they}} are open or closed; on {{the presence or absence of}} protection for certain equipment; the state of turbofan blades or the wear of landing gear tires.|$|E
5|$|Although {{individuals}} with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, language <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> use is often atypical. Abnormalities include verbosity, abrupt transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance, use of metaphor meaningful {{only to the}} speaker, auditory perception deficits, unusually pedantic, formal or idiosyncratic speech, and oddities in loudness, pitch, intonation, prosody, and rhythm. Echolalia has also been observed in {{individuals with}} AS.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the acquisition, Eli Lilly gained {{complete}} ownership of Cialis, and promptly shut down Icos operations and laid off Icos personnel, except for 127employees working at the biologics facility. Icos was the largest biotechnology company in the state of Washington {{at the time of the}} <b>acquisition,</b> <b>and</b> employed around 700people. In December2007, CMC Biopharmaceuticals A/S, a Copenhagen-based provider of contract biomanufacturing services, bought the Bothell biologics facility and retained the existing 127employees.|$|E

5|$|By {{detecting}} {{and tracking}} visual landmarks, {{in addition to}} estimating its position relative to the aircraft, the robot can perform a visual servoing.

Artificial intelligence arbitrating various locations is also under consideration.|$|E
5|$|Concerns from Rainier Valley {{residents}} over blocked intersections, property <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> equity led the RTA (later re-branded as Sound Transit) {{to study}} a $400 million tunnel through the Rainier Valley. In November 1999, the Sound Transit Board instead selected an at-grade alignment on Martin Luther King Jr. Way {{to the west of}} Rainier, with a station at South Edmunds Street.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, the RCAF {{obtained}} 66 McDonnell CF-101 Voodoo aircraft, {{one of the}} American designs the RCAF originally rejected, {{to serve}} in the role originally intended for the Avro Arrow.

5|$|Since preservation, {{the railway}} has {{operated}} {{as a tourist}} attraction, expanding its rolling stock through <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> an engineering programme to build new locomotives and carriages. In 1976, an extension was opened along the former mineral line from Abergynolwyn to the new station at Nant Gwernol. In 2001, the preservation society celebrated its 50th anniversary, and in 2005 a major rebuilding and extension of Tywyn Wharf station took place, including a much-expanded facility for the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum.|$|E

5|$|Acquisition {{of second}} and {{additional}} languages can come at any age, through exposure {{in daily life}} or courses. Children learning a second language {{are more likely to}} achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.|$|E
5|$|Altogether, {{thirteen}} {{pieces were}} stolen {{at an estimated}} loss of $500 million, making the robbery the largest private property theft in history. Empty frames remain hanging in the museum, both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for when they are returned. One of the paintings, The Concert, was Gardner's first major <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> one of only 34 known Vermeer works in the world. It {{is thought to be}} the most valuable unrecovered stolen painting, with a value estimated at over $200 million. Another painting, The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, is Rembrandt's only known seascape. The bronze finial was taken from the top of a Napoleonic flag, possibly appearing like gold to the thieves. The museum is offering a $100,000 reward for this piece alone.|$|E
5|$|Behaviorists {{focus on}} the <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> {{teaching}} of delayed gratification, and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay. Behavior analysts capitalize on the effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards contingent on the person's current behavior, which promotes learning a delay of gratification. It {{is important to note}} that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed, the reward must have some value to the participant. Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as the reward is not a strong reinforcer of the desired behavior.|$|E
