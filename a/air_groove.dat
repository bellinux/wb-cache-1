30|$|In this study, a {{technique}} for the optimization of the optical characteristics of multi-channel filters after fabrication is proposed. The multi-channel filter under consideration {{is based on}} a Si photonic crystal (PhC), tunable liquid crystal and opto-fluidic technologies. By filling <b>air</b> <b>grooves</b> in the one-dimensional, Si-Air PhC with a nematic liquid crystal, an efficiently coupled multi-channel filter can be realised in which a wide stop band is used for channel separation over a wide frequency range. By selectively tuning the refractive index in various coupled cavities, continuous individual tuning of the central channel (or edge channels) up to 25 % of the total channel spacing is demonstrated. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the electro-optical solution for the compensation of fabrication tolerances in an integrated platform.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a highly compact silicon nano-membrane based optical phased array {{fabricated}} using conventional CMOS processing on silicon-on-insulator that provides for over 10 degrees of beam steering in a silicon slab at λ= 1. 55 µm using transverse-electrical polarized light. A low loss 1 -to- 12 multi-mode interference (MMI) optical beam splitter with high uniformity is used to provide inputs to the optical phased array. Using an unequally spaced waveguide array permits us to relax the half-wavelength spacing requirement for large angle beam steering, thereby avoiding the optical coupling between adjacent waveguides and reducing the side-lobe-level of the array radiation pattern. S-bend waveguides convert the equally spaced MMI output to the unequally spaced wave guide array, while passively equalizing the phases of each array element {{to compensate for the}} MMI output phase profile.

The experimental and calculated reflection spectra are in good agreement in the entire spectral range studied. The analysis of experimental and calculated spectra gave close values of the effective refractive indices and birefringence of the studied structures in the long-wavelength spectral region.

30|$|The air-injection {{pressure}} {{was set at}} 0.55  MPa, with air being injected at room temperature. Air injection was started when the board thickness reached 10 or 30  mm and was then stopped for the final 15  s of the pressing time. An air-injection device was prepared with holes measuring 1  mm in diameter. The holes were arranged on the lower plate with a spacing of 25  mm between the centers of adjacent holes, resulting in 81 holes in an area measuring 200  ×  200  mm through which air was injected. Holes were also punched on the caul plate (upper plate) through which high-pressure air and vapor were discharged (Fig.  1 c). Because the diameter of and spacing between the holes on the caul plate were equal to those on the air-injection device, this device also contained 81 holes on the caul plate {{in an area of}} 200  ×  200  mm. To discharge high-pressure <b>air,</b> <b>grooves</b> 1.5 -mm deep and 3 -mm wide were cut to connect the holes {{on one side of the}} caul plate.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{stability and}} breakup of a thin liquid film on a solid surface under {{the action of}} disjoining pressure. The solid surface is structured by parallel <b>grooves.</b> <b>Air</b> is trapped in the grooves under the liquid film. Our mathematical model {{takes into account the}} effect of slip due to the presence of menisci separating the liquid film from the <b>air</b> inside the <b>grooves,</b> the deformation of these menisci due to local variations of pressure in the liquid film, and nonuniformities of the Hamaker constant which measures the strength of disjoining pressure. Both linear stability and strongly nonlinear evolution of the film are analyzed. Surface structuring results in decrease of the fastest growing instability wavelength and the rupture time. It is shown that a simplified description of film dynamics based on the standard formula for effective slip leads to significant deviations from the behavior seen in our simulations. Self-similar decay over several orders of magnitude of the film thickness near the rupture point is observed. We also show that the presence of the grooves can lead to instability in otherwise stable films if the relative groove width is above a critical value, found as a function of disjoining pressure parameters. © 2011 American Physical Society.

40|$|Liquid {{water in}} low sloped roofs almost always causes problems. Roofs are {{designed}} only {{to control the}} migration of vapor, if at all. Small amounts of water leakage/penetration, may cause mold growth or catastrophic corrosion in current roofs systems. In a recent paper by the authors the effect of exterior surface emissive and absorptive properties {{was found to have}} a significant effect on the moisture performance of a roof that had a leak. Depending on the surface characteristics, roof systems can be designed to effectively manage water penetration, but at an energy cost. In the roofs system examined previously, air leakage was not included. In the present study, the authors reinvestigated the effect of water penetration and the influence of air leakage on the hygrothermal performance of a few selected roofs. The drying potential of a groove ventilated roof is examined. The performance concept is based on the fact that warming up of <b>air</b> in the <b>groove</b> increases it's ability to transport moisture to the outside. Solar radiation raises the temperature of <b>air</b> in the <b>grooves</b> and on average, during a sunny summer day 0. 5 L of water can be ventilated out of the roof per 1 m width of the roof. In this paper, one climatic condition was investigated; a hot and humid Climate representative of Houston, TX. The specific questions that the paper addresses are: What are the vapor and liquid control dynamic involved in the moisture migration of a roof in Houston TX? and how does airflow influence the performance of a roof that is initially wet ? A state-of-the-art numerical model was used to address these issues. Results showed that the drying potential depends on the ventilation rates. The roof system with ventilation grooves dried out faster from the initially wet stage than the roof without the ventilation grooves. The total increase in heat loss of the roof was found to be between 0 - 5 % depending on the thickness of the insulation. The ventilation can cool down the temperature of the roof in the middle of a hot and sunny day thus reducing the heat load to the inside...|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{hydrophobic}} nano-sculptured {{thin films}} with different roughness were fabricated {{and the result}} showed that structures which trap <b>air</b> pocket between <b>grooves</b> are more hydrophobic. By increasing roughness, void fraction and structural symmetry contact angle (hydrophobicity) increased. In addition, the wetting model of 4 - and 5 -pointed helical star structures was described by Cassie–Baxter equation, while other structures, namely vertical nano-rod, inclined nano-rod and 3 -pointed helical star, were in Wenzel state. All of the Mn nano-sculptured thin films indicate contact angle hysteresis higher than 20 ° that means these surfaces are acting as a sticky superhydrophobic surface with petal effect. The physicochemical property of the surface with 4 -pointed star-like helical structure was examined for different liquids with different polarities (i.e., formamide, tetrahydrofuran, water and α-bromonaphthalene), and it was found that water has the highest work of cohesion and spreading as well as largest contact angle.

The embossing process was studied in a combination of simulations and experiments. Firstly, the viscoelastic model of PLGA was built after testing the material properties. Secondly, the hot embossing process was simulated by ABAQUS finite element software. The deformation rules of PLGA during hot embossing were then achieved. The pressures inside the PLGA materials were different at various places during hot embossing, which lead to the differences of the filling speeds. As a result, the inner structures were easier to get formed than the outer structures. And the fluidity of PGLA would increase with the raising temperature, which however caused serious material overflow. Finally the hot embossing experiments were presented to verify the simulation results. Agreed with the filling rules of the simulation, enough duration was necessary to let the outer corners of the microstructures be formed completely. Moreover the trapped <b>air</b> in the <b>grooves</b> was compressed into small bubbles at the corners.

The conclusions from this testing are: (1) The filter flux at 0. 06 wt% solids reached a near constant value at an average of 0. 26 gpm/ft{sup 2 } (6. 25 gpm total). (2) The filter flux at 0. 29 wt% solids reached a near constant value at an average of 0. 17 gpm/ft{sup 2 } (4 gpm total). (3) The filter flux at 1. 29 wt% solids reached a near constant value at an average of 0. 10 gpm/ft{sup 2 } (2. 4 gpm total). (4) Because of differences in solids loadings, a direct comparison between crossflow filter flux and rotary filter flux is not possible. The data show the rotary filter produces a higher flux than the crossflow filter, but the improvement is not as large as seen in previous testing. (5) Filtrate turbidity measured < 4 NTU in all samples collected. (6) During production, the filter should be rinsed with filtrate or dilute caustic and drained prior to an extended shutdown to prevent the formation of a layer of settled solids on top of the filter disks.

40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} noise regulations concerning automotive vehicles {{particularly in}} Europe are forcing Tyre manufacturers {{as well as}} the automotive manufacturers to reduce radiated noise. With the future moving towards electric/hybrid vehicles, the ever present tyre noise will become more dominant. Even in the case of automotive engines running on fossil fuels, tyre noise dominates above speeds of 40 Km/h. Understanding the causes of tyre noise is the first step towards finding engineering solutions to reduce it. Numerical modelling can help the tyre engineer in understanding the causes of tyre-road noise with a design tool. In the present work, the noise radiated by the tyre surface is computed numerically using three different computational techniques. Both the time domain approach and the frequency domain approaches are used and the results are compared. The input structural vibrations are computed in ABAQUS (Ref. 1) and the results are then imported to LMSVirtual. Lab (Ref. 2) for further acoustic computations. As the main focus of this work is on the acoustic computations, only {{a brief description of the}} process involved in the structural vibration calculations is provided. In the present work, the “Horn effect” is inherently captured in the acoustic simulations. Two model tyres, viz., with tread pattern and with circumferential grooves is evaluated. The presence of tread leads to the phenomenon of stick slip and stick snap mechanisms contributing to the overall tyre noise. In addition, the motion of <b>air</b> through the <b>grooves</b> causes <b>air</b> pumping noise. It is to be noted that the structural vibration computations were performed on a rotating tyre that translated on a stationary road. In other words, the tyre underwent rotational as well as translational displacement. The acoustic computations are however performed on a stationary tyre model. One of the challenges addressed in the present work is the conversion of transient vibration results on a stationary acoustic mesh. The surface accelerations, required as boundary conditions, are converted to the frequency domain by the Fast Fourier Transformation for the Harmonic computations. The details of the structural models {{as well as the}} acoustic models and a short description of the techniques used in the computations of the radiated noise are described in the next section...|$|R
