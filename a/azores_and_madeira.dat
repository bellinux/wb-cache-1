5|$|Portuguese {{immigrants}} {{had been}} in Hawaii since the whaling days. Many of them were mixed blood Afro-Portuguese sailors who found the brown-skinned Native Hawaiians free of racial bias towards them. The first Portuguese plantation labor emigration to Hawaii came from the <b>Azores</b> <b>and</b> <b>Madeira</b> in 1878, starved out of their homelands by widespread grape vine fungus. They emigrated mostly in family groups, joining an established community of their own culture.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic torpedo {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in cool waters {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic Ocean. In the east, it is found from northern Scotland to the Gulf of Guinea, including the entire Mediterranean Sea (but not the Black Sea), the <b>Azores,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Madeira,</b> as well as from Namibia to western South Africa. In the west, it occurs from southern Nova Scotia to Venezuela and Brazil. It is rare in the North Sea and the Mediterranean and south of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|One of the widest-ranging {{deepwater}} sharks, the Portuguese dogfish is patchily distributed {{around the}} world. In the western Atlantic, it occurs from the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to the U.S. state of Delaware. In the eastern Atlantic, {{it is found}} from Iceland to Sierra Leone, including the western Mediterranean Sea, the <b>Azores</b> <b>and</b> <b>Madeira,</b> {{as well as from}} southern Namibia to western South Africa. In the Indian Ocean, this species has been caught off the Seychelles. In the Pacific, this shark occurs off Japan, New Zealand, and Australia from Cape Hawke, New South Wales, to Beachport, South Australia, including Tasmania.|$|E

5|$|The {{porbeagle}} has {{an almost}} global amphitemperate distribution, i.e. it is {{absent from the}} tropics; in the North Pacific, its niche is assumed by the salmon shark. It is found mostly within 30–70°N and 30–50°S latitudes. In the North Atlantic, the northern limit of its range extends from the Newfoundland Grand Banks off Canada, through southern Greenland, to Scandinavia and Russia; the southern limit of its range extends from New Jersey and Bermuda, through the <b>Azores</b> <b>and</b> <b>Madeira,</b> to Morocco. It {{is found in the}} Mediterranean Sea, but not the Black Sea. Normally, North Atlantic sharks only stray as far south as South Carolina and the Gulf of Guinea, but pregnant females from the western North Atlantic population are known to range into the Sargasso Sea, almost as far as Hispaniola, to give birth. In the Southern Hemisphere, the porbeagle apparently occupies a continuous band bound in the south by the Antarctic Convergence, and extending as far north as Chile and Brazil, the Western Cape province of South Africa, Australia to southern Western Australia and southern Queensland, and New Zealand. It is speculated that the porbeagle colonized the Southern Hemisphere during the Quaternary glaciation (beginning c. 2.6 Ma), when the tropical climate zone was much narrower than it is today.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azores</b> <b>and</b> <b>Madeira</b> are {{two groups}} of Portuguese islands in the Atlantic. <b>Azores</b> <b>and</b> <b>Madeira</b> are {{integral}} parts of the Portuguese Republic, but both have the special status as Autonomous Regions, {{with a degree of}} self-governance. While derogations from the application of EU law could apply, none do. Their VAT is lower than the rest of Portugal, but they are not outside the EU VAT Area.|$|E

25|$|Giant squid are widespread, {{occurring}} {{in all of}} the world's oceans. They are usually found near continental and island slopes from the North Atlantic Ocean, especially Newfoundland, Norway, the northern British Isles, Spain and the oceanic islands of the <b>Azores</b> <b>and</b> <b>Madeira,</b> to the South Atlantic around southern Africa, the North Pacific around Japan, and the southwestern Pacific around New Zealand and Australia. Specimens are rare in tropical and polar latitudes.|$|E
25|$|A {{national}} car {{registration system}} {{was established in}} 1911. The country was divided into zones (North, Centre, South, and, from 1918, the <b>Azores</b> <b>and</b> <b>Madeira),</b> each having an identification number sequence for the licence plates, which was N-000, C-000, S-000, A-000 and M-000 respectively. Hire cars had a letter A added after the registration (e.g. S-4226-A) and provisionally registered vehicles had WW added (e.g. S-1703-WW). The plates were white letters on a black background.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>Azores</b> <b>and</b> <b>Madeira</b> the {{new system}} was only adopted in 1962. The Azores were divided into three {{registration}} districts: Ponta Delgada, Angra do Heroismo and Horta. The letters AN were reserved for Angra, AR and AS for Ponta Delgada and HO for Horta. For Madeira the groups MA and MD were reserved. The white letters on red TD, TG, TH and TF were for temporary licences respectively in Ponta Delgada, Angra, Horta and Madeira.|$|E

25|$|With {{the coming}} of the Captaincy the {{population}} began to grow, but the great population growth happened between 1747 and 1756 with the arrival of about 6,000 settlers coming from the Archipelago of <b>Azores</b> <b>and</b> from <b>Madeira</b> Island. The development of the agriculture, the cotton and linen industry and the commerce followed the Azorean occupation.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to the capture of Success on 13 December, St Fiorenzo and Clyde captured the privateer Dorade eight days later. The actual captor of Dorade was Clyde. Dorade was from Bordeaux and was pierced for 18 guns, though she only had 12. She had been out 50 days and had been cruising off the <b>Azores</b> <b>and</b> <b>Madeira,</b> but had captured nothing. She and her crew of 93 men {{were on their way}} home when Clyde captured her. Unfortunately, the commander of the prize crew hoisted too much sail with the result that Dorade overturned, drowning all 19 members of the prize crew.|$|E
25|$|The escudo {{was used}} in the Portuguese mainland, the <b>Azores</b> <b>and</b> <b>Madeira,</b> with no {{distinction}} of coins or banknotes. In Portugal's African colonies, the escudo was generally used up to independence, with Portuguese and sometime local coins circulating alongside banknotes of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino, rather than those of the Bank of Portugal used on the mainland. For more details, see the escudos of Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea and São Tomé and Príncipe. Only Cape Verde continues to use the escudo. In Macau, the currency during the colonial period was, as it is today, the pataca. Timor-Leste adopted the escudo whilst still a Portuguese colony, having earlier used the pataca. Portuguese India adopted the escudo before it was annexed by India.|$|E

25|$|Some {{residents}} of Hawaii speak Hawaii Creole English (HCE), endonymically called pidgin or pidgin English. The lexicon of HCE derives mainly from English but also uses words that have derived from Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Ilocano and Tagalog. During the 19th century, {{the increase in}} immigration—mainly from China, Japan, Portugal—especially from the <b>Azores</b> <b>and</b> <b>Madeira,</b> and Spain—catalyzed {{the development of a}} hybrid variant of English known to its speakers as pidgin. By the early 20th century, pidgin speakers had children who acquired it as their first language. HCE speakers use some Hawaiian words without those words being considered archaic. Most place names are retained from Hawaiian, as are some names for plants and animals. For example, tuna fish is often called by its Hawaiian name, ahi.|$|E
25|$|In the new {{organization}} implemented in 2006, the military regions, the Airborne Troops Command and the Santa Margarida Military Camp command would be finally disbanded. This implied the completely disbandment of the territorial defense brigades. The <b>Azores</b> <b>and</b> <b>Madeira</b> military zones were however maintained, {{being responsible for}} the command of the garrison and territorial defense forces stationed in their respective isles. The three operational brigades - respectively renamed Rapid Reaction Brigade (BriRR), Mechanized Brigade (BriMec) and Intervention Brigade (BrigInt) - assumed also the administrative role of their former parent commands, starting to control the regiments responsible for maintaining their operational units (the exception being the BriMec, whose operational units were not maintained by regiments, being administratively directly under the brigade headquarters). As part of this {{new organization}}, the re-raised Commando units and the Special Operation Troops were integrated in the BriRR, joining the parachute troops. The BrigInt evolved to a light mechanized brigade, with its units being equipped with wheeled armored vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The last Army {{organizations}} in the Monarchy occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By that time, the Army was administratively organized in three grand military circumscriptions (North, Center and South), each including two military territorial divisions, plus two military commands (<b>Azores</b> <b>and</b> <b>Madeira).</b> Distributed by the several territorial divisions, there were four cavalry brigades and 12 infantry brigades, each including two regiments. Each division, brigade and military command had its own headquarters. The Lisbon Entrenched Camp constituted a separate military command headed by a general, with its own permanent garrison artillery and engineering units. In 1901, the units of Army included one engineering regiment (with sappers-miners, pontoneers, telegraph and railway companies), three engineering independent companies (fortress sappers, torpedoes and fortress telegraph), six mounted artillery regiments, one horse artillery batteries group, one mountain artillery batteries group, six garrison artillery groups, four garrison artillery independent batteries, 10 cavalry regiments, six caçadores battalions (these including also troops of cyclists and machineguns) and 27 infantry regiments. Besides these, the Army also included a number of service support units, schools and other establishments. When mobilized to enter in operations, the Army constituted the Field Army. The Field Army included a commander-in-chief and its headquarters, four active army divisions, active army independent troops (including two cavalry brigades), active army train and garrison and reserve troops. Each active division included a headquarters, two infantry brigades (each with three infantry regiments), a caçadores regiment, a cavalry regiment, three field artillery groups, a sappers-miners company and a divisional train. If needed army corps could be organized through the grouping of divisions and composite brigades which included all arms and service supports units.|$|E
