2500|$|The perp walk {{has been}} {{described}} as primarily serving the interests of the police and the media rather than the defendant or justice. [...] "Cynics might call the perp walk the crime reporter's red carpet", says crime reporter Art Miller. [...] "Police and prosecutors get to show off their trophy. [...] lap it up because that's all we know we're going to get" [...] since so many other aspects {{of the criminal justice system}} prior to trial take place out of public view, and even trials themselves may not always be televised or even photographed. [...] "Those 30 seconds of a perp walk are the lifeblood to the TV news. Between that and the mug shot that is often <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> as visuals to tell a crime story." [...] Retired NYPD detective Nicholas Casale likens it to a service: [...] "It promotes the arrest, it allows the defendant an opportunity to make a statement to the press, and it's centralized".|$|E
2500|$|Ali {{opened the}} fight moving and scoring with right crosses to Foreman's head. Then, {{beginning}} in the second round—and {{to the consternation of}} his corner—Ali retreated to the ropes and invited Foreman to hit him while covering up, clinching and counter-punching, all while verbally taunting Foreman. The move, which would later become known as the [...] "Rope-a-dope", so violated conventional boxing wisdom—letting one of the hardest hitters in boxing strike at will—that at ringside writer George Plimpton thought the fight had to be fixed. Foreman, increasingly angered, threw punches that were deflected and did not land squarely. Midway through the fight, as Foreman began tiring, Ali countered more frequently and effectively with punches and flurries, which electrified the pro-Ali crowd. In the eighth round, Ali dropped an exhausted Foreman with a combination at center ring; Foreman failed to make the count. Against the odds, and amidst pandemonium in the ring, Ali had regained the title by knockout. In reflecting on the fight, George Foreman later said: [...] "I thought Ali was just one more knockout victim until, about the seventh round, I hit him hard to the jaw and he held me and whispered in my ear: 'That <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>got,</b> George?' I realized that this ain't what I thought it was." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very well. Then <b>you</b> {{have done}} <b>all</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> to do. Say another word--one single word--and Wemmick shall {{give you your}} money back." ...|$|R
60|$|Ah, that's {{what they}} <b>all</b> said. But <b>you</b> <b>got</b> over it very well.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is THAT <b>all</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> to say?" [...] asked Newman, slowly {{rising out}} of his chair. [...] "That's a poor show for a clever lady like you, marquise. Come, try again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{guess you}} want to see Mr. Brownsill,' he said. 'Well, I am in his place now, and <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to do is to tell me what book you want.' ...|$|E
6000|$|You are the man, if I mistake you not, [...] Who lately with a supplicating twitch [...] Plucked at {{the pockets}} of the London rich And paid your share-engraver <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>got.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, I will. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> {{to do is}} to trot up Hooper Street a {{block and}} maow--and if I'm asleep, you throw some gravel at the window and that'll fetch me." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. TRAVERS. Ah! We {{were just}} {{wondering}} where <b>all</b> <b>you</b> people had <b>got</b> to.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Isobel, Isobel," [...] {{he broke}} out, [...] "don't be so bitter, {{especially}} as it is of no use. Besides after <b>all</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> everything that a girl can have--money and position and looks----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rain {{and wind}} together!" [...] Mr. Atherton shouted in {{reply to the}} chorus of {{questions}} from those below. [...] "Now, <b>all</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> {{to do is to}} make yourselves comfortable, for there will be no going up again for some time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good many, I'm afraid. All {{talking about}} you.... It's up to you. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> {{to do is}} not think you know it all, and keep still. Keep still till you {{understand}} the faculty's difficulties just a little better. Savvy? Don't that sound fairly reasonable?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The town'll be wide open," [...] Joe Goose went on. [...] "Booze? It'll {{run like}} water. The {{politicians}} have bought {{the stocks of}} the saloons. There'll be no charge. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to do is walk right up and call for it. We'll raise hell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come on, Major," [...] he said, handing Alan one spear {{and taking}} another himself. [...] "Old cannibal quite right, very nice {{night for a}} walk. Come on, Major, river shallow just here. I think this happen and try it before dark. You just follow Jeekie, that <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to do." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We don't know," [...] said Abdul, testily. [...] "They {{wrote to}} us. They seem <b>all</b> right. Haven't <b>you</b> <b>got</b> {{a lot of}} people in your league that you never heard of?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So, Charley, old fellow, {{you were}} the sad dog after <b>all.</b> <b>You</b> <b>got</b> me out of it, and I owe you my thanks, but you need not have put your neck into the noose. I should have come off with flying colours, and made them all make fools of themselves, if you had only waited." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what I {{told him}} once, {{but he says}} money ain't the thing--or {{not the only thing}} you got to give to them poor folks. You got to give your time and your {{knowledge}} and your love--I don't know what <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to give yourself, if you expect to help 'em. That's what Coonrod says." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Gaylord {{found herself}} upon {{the point of}} {{experiencing}} a painful emotion of sympathy, but she saved herself by saying: [...] "Well, Mr. Gaylord, I don't know as you've got anybody but yourself to thank for it <b>all.</b> <b>You</b> <b>got</b> him here, in the first place." [...] She {{took one of the}} kerosene lamps from the table, and went upstairs, leaving him to follow at his will.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{something}} of a hustler," [...] he remarked with a smile. [...] "For <b>all</b> that, <b>you</b> <b>got</b> a nasty knock, and your quitting for a time is justified. Well, if you feel lonesome, come along and dine at our hotel. Then we'll go and see the American opera. I'm told the show is good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Lord! My dear Captin, 800L. {{worth of}} coals {{is a mere}} nothink.

6000|$|... "No, no, no," [...] {{said the}} earl; [...] "you {{are not the}} right person at <b>all.</b> What have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to do with it? You've merely known them as family friends, but that's not enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Always thought {{white man}} mad at bottom," [...] he said, shaking his big head. [...] "To benighted black nigger thing so very simple. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to do, make love and cut {{when you get}} chance. Then she pleased as Punch, {{everything}} go smooth and Jeekie get no more kicks. Christian religion business very good, but won't wash in Asiki-land. Your reverend uncle find out that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's not {{everybody}} that's talkin'," [...] returned Willy, [...] "and I guess that them that does gets their opinions from one quarter, but I've heard {{people say that}} it's pretty plain that <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> out of that gold mine you spent in buyin' the things you brought home in your trunks; for if you didn't, you wouldn't be livin' like this, helpin' to do your own housework and cookin'." ...|$|E
60|$|So then he {{set to work}} to get up a plan to {{make him}} celebrated; and pretty soon he struck it, and offered to take me and Jim in. Tom Sawyer was always free and generous that way. There's a-plenty of boys that's mighty good and {{friendly}} when YOU'VE got a good thing, but when a good thing happens to come their way they don't {{say a word to}} you, and try to hog it all. That warn't ever Tom Sawyer's way, I can say that for him. There's plenty of boys that will come hankering and groveling around you when you've got an apple and beg the core off of you; but when they've got one, and you beg for the core and remind them how you give them a core one time, they say thank you 'most to death, but there ain't a-going to be no core. But I notice they always git come up with; <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to do is to wait.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, but don't sit here, Louise," [...] {{the latter}} pleaded, {{lingering}} near her. [...] "I {{was wrong to}} let you sit down at <b>all</b> after <b>you</b> had <b>got</b> heated." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Men {{are carried}} {{as well as}} women, Beric, and as you are a wounded man you have a double right to be carried. Here is a bag with <b>all</b> those {{ornaments}} <b>you</b> <b>got.</b> It is quite heavy to lift." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{nothing to}} you, Captain Hotspur, whether I have profit or loss. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> 'as <b>got</b> {{to look to}} is to pay me what you owe me. And I intend that you shall, or by G---- you shall suffer for it! I'm {{not going to stand}} it any longer. I know where to have you, and have you I will." ...|$|R
6000|$|As he {{approached}} the office he walked faster and faster, muttering, [...] "Guess better hustle." [...] All about him the city was hustling, for hustling's sake. Men in motors were hustling to pass {{one another in the}} hustling traffic. Men were hustling to catch trolleys, with another trolley a minute behind, and to leap from the trolleys, to gallop across the sidewalk, to hurl themselves into buildings, into hustling express elevators. Men in dairy lunches were hustling to gulp down the food which cooks had hustled to fry. Men in barber shops were snapping, [...] "Jus' shave me once over. Gotta hustle." [...] Men were feverishly getting rid of visitors in offices adorned with the signs, [...] "This Is My Busy Day" [...] and [...] "The Lord Created the World in Six Days--You Can Spiel <b>All</b> <b>You</b> <b>Got</b> to Say in Six Minutes." [...] Men who had made five thousand, year before last, and ten thousand last year, were urging on nerve-yelping bodies and parched brains so that they might make twenty thousand this year; and the men who had broken down immediately after making their twenty thousand dollars were hustling to catch trains, to hustle through the vacations which the hustling doctors had ordered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Stan; let's {{get this}} clear. You've {{got an idea}} somehow that it's you that do all the selling. Where d' you get that stuff? Where d' you think you'd be if it wasn't for our capital behind you, and our lists of properties, and all the {{prospects}} we find for you? <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to do is follow up our tips and close the deal. The hall-porter could sell Babbitt-Thompson listings! You say you're engaged to a girl, but {{have to put in}} your evenings chasing after buyers. Well, why the devil shouldn't you? What do you want to do? Sit around holding her hand? Let me tell you, Stan, if your girl is worth her salt, she'll be glad to know you're out hustling, making some money to furnish the home-nest, instead of doing the lovey-dovey. The kind of fellow that kicks about working overtime, that wants to spend his evenings reading trashy novels or spooning and exchanging a lot of nonsense and foolishness with some girl, he ain't the kind of upstanding, energetic young man, with a future--and with Vision!--that we want here. How about it? What's your Ideal, anyway? Do you want to make money and be a responsible member of the community, {{or do you want to}} be a loafer, with no Inspiration or Pep?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Blame it, {{this whole}} thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be. And so it makes it so rotten {{difficult}} to get up a difficult plan. There ain't no watchman to be drugged--now there OUGHT to be a watchman. There ain't even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to. And there's Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his bed: why, <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain. And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the punkin-headed nigger, and don't send nobody to watch the nigger. Jim could a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn't be no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg. Why, drat it, Huck, it's the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent ALL the difficulties. Well, we can't help it; we got to {{do the best we can}} with the materials we've got. Anyhow, there's one thing--there's more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers, where there warn't one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your own head. Now look at just that one thing of the lantern. When you come down to the cold facts, we simply got to LET ON that a lantern's resky. Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to, I believe. Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who are {{you calling}} ’Bob’?" [...] he demanded, in an {{unsteady}} voice. [...] "You keep yourself to yourself. I’ve heard <b>all</b> about <b>you.</b> You’ve <b>got</b> to stay there till my brother-in-law comes home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Go away, and don't {{come back}} any more;--that's <b>all.</b> <b>You</b> can't both marry her. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> to {{understand}} is this. I'm not the man to give my daughter a single shilling if she marries against my consent. By the God that hears me, Sir Felix, she shall not have one shilling. But look you,--if you'll give this up, I shall be proud to co-operate with you in anything {{you may wish to}} have done in the city.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The 1969 top 3 UK hit single for Blue Mink, [...] "Melting Pot", has the lyric: [...] "take a {{pinch of}} white man/Wrap him up in black skin. ... Mixed with yellow Chinkees. You know <b>you</b> lump it <b>all</b> together/And <b>you</b> <b>got</b> a recipe for a get-along scene/Oh what a {{beautiful}} dream/If it could only come true".
