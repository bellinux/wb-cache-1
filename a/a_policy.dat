5|$|Following the War of 1812, the United States pursued <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> {{of trying}} to prevent wars among Native Americans in the Upper Mississippi River region. This was not {{strictly}} for humanitarian reasons: intertribal warfare {{made it more difficult}} for the United States to acquire Indian land and move the tribes to the West, <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> known as Indian removal, which had become the primary goal by the late 1820s.

5|$|At party level, the Labour Party, in {{opposition}} until October 1964, was overtly against Southern Rhodesian independence under the 1961 constitution and {{supportive of the}} black nationalist movement on ideological and moral grounds.

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{understood}} that <b>a</b> price-level stabihza-tion <b>policy</b> is more ambitious than <b>a</b> zero-inflation <b>policy.</b> Targeting zero inflation {{means that the}} cen-‘tral bank brings inflation to a halt but leaves the price level where {{it is at the}} end of the inflation. By con-trast, targeting stable prices means that the central bank ends inflation and also rolls back prices to some fixed target level. By reversing inflated prices and restoring them to their preexisting level, <b>a</b> price-stabilization <b>policy</b> eradicates the upward drift of prices that can occur under <b>a</b> zero-inflation <b>policy.</b> It follows that <b>a</b> stable-price <b>policy</b> is more stringent than <b>a</b> zero-inflation <b>policy.</b> The history of monetary thought abounds with price-level (as opposed to inflation-rate) stabilizatio...|$|R

5|$|Belgium had pursued <b>a</b> <b>policy</b> of {{neutrality}} {{since its}} independence in 1830, successfully avoiding becoming a belligerent in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71).

40|$|In {{previous}} work, {{the author}} devised {{a collection of}} ontologies to model the generic structure and characteristics of the APPEL policy description language [18] utilised within the ACCENT policy system [1]. Two ontologies, namely genpol. owl and wizpol. owl, were defined using OWL (Web Ontology Language [10]) to describe the generic aspects of the policy language and aspects of how the policy wizard (user interface) uses the language. These generic ontologies are explained in CSM- 169 [3], while an ontology modelling a domain-specific implementation of the policy language for call control is described in CSM- 170 [4]. This document describes how these ontologies have been extended to define the structure of resolution policies, in addition to standard domain <b>policies.</b> <b>A</b> resolution <b>policy</b> has <b>a</b> similar structural composition to <b>a</b> standard <b>policy,</b> but places restrictions {{on the characteristics of}} its components.
