30|$|In this section, we {{consider}} several existing filtering approaches and modify them for our need. First group of approaches {{works on the}} depth map images with using no structural information from the <b>available</b> <b>color</b> channel. Gaussian smoothing and H. 264 in-loop deblocking filter [15] are the filtering approaches included in this group. The approaches of the second group actively use <b>available</b> <b>color</b> frame to improve depth map quality. While there is an apparent correlation between the color channel and the accompanying depth map, {{it is important to}} characterize which color and structure information can help for depth processing.|$|R

25|$|The Audi V8 came {{standard}} with a {{range of}} features, including a BOSE audio system with eight speakers, walnut wood trim, leather interior, and heated seats.

25|$|During 2012, the building's {{four hundred}} {{metal halide lamps}} and {{floodlights}} were replaced with 1,200 LED fixtures, increasing the <b>available</b> <b>colors</b> from nine to over 16 million. The computer-controlled system allows the building to be illuminated {{in ways that were}} unable to be done previously with plastic gels. For instance, on November 6, 2012, CNN used the top of the Empire State Building as a scoreboard for the 2012 United States presidential election. When incumbent president Barack Obama had reached the 270 electoral votes necessary to win re-election, the lights turned blue. Had Republican challenger Mitt Romney won, the building would have been lit red. Also, on November 26, 2012, the building had its first ever synchronized light show, using music from recording artist Alicia Keys. The building's owners adhere to strict standards in using the lights; for instance, they would not use the lights to play advertisements.|$|E
500|$|Development of the game's title {{screen was}} {{inspired}} by loading screens {{that were used in}} most computer games at the time; the objective was to create a nice-looking graphic while waiting for the game to load, even though the NES, more rooted in arcade traditions, did not require that. Pickford spent most of his character space on the title screen image; he was limited in the number of <b>available</b> <b>colors</b> due to the more limited graphic capabilities of the NES (as opposed to most home computers), as it was more designed for scrolling and animation and not for stationary graphics. The sword in the title screen used character sprites and used a different palette from the picture of Kuros himself; the sword had to be vertical as the NES hardware did not allow for too many sprites horizontally. Pickford planned to use, and completed, an Ironsword logo of his own when Acclaim made him use their planned logo, which he said [...] "was a bit more bland and blocky, with detail that didn't work very well at such a low pixel resolution".|$|E
5000|$|The {{algorithm}} achieves dithering {{by applying}} a threshold map [...] on the pixels displayed, causing {{some of the}} pixels to be rendered at a different color, depending on how far in between the <b>color</b> is of <b>available</b> <b>color</b> entries.|$|R
50|$|If simple video overlay is {{intended}} through a transparent color, one palette entry is specifically reserved for this purpose, {{and it is}} discounted as an <b>available</b> <b>color.</b> Some machines, such as the MSX series, had the transparent color reserved by hardware.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it is easy}} to see that G is 3-choosable: picking {{arbitrary}} colors for the vertices A and B leaves at least one <b>available</b> <b>color</b> for each of the remaining vertices, and these colors may be chosen arbitrarily.|$|R
2500|$|The {{sides are}} {{conventionally}} called White and Black. But, in earlier European chess writings, the sides were often called Red and Black because {{those were the}} commonly <b>available</b> <b>colors</b> of ink when handwriting drawing a chess game layout. In such layouts, each piece was represented by its name, often abbreviated (e.g. [...] "ch'r" [...] for French [...] "chevalier" [...] = [...] "knight").|$|E

2500|$|This {{indirect}} scheme {{restricts the}} number of <b>available</b> <b>colors</b> in an image CLUT typically 256-cubed (8 bits in three color channels with values of 0255) although each color in the RGB24 CLUT table has only 8 bits representing 256 codes {{for each of the}} R, G, and B primaries combinatorial math theory says this means that any given color can be one of 16,777,216 possible colors. However, the advantage is that an indexed-color image file can be significantly smaller than it would be with only 8 bits per pixel for each primary.|$|E
5000|$|The {{infinite}} number of <b>colors</b> <b>available</b> {{through the lens of}} a camera is impossible to display on a computer screen; thus converting any photograph to a digital representation necessarily involves some quantization. Practically speaking, 24-bit color is sufficiently rich to represent almost all colors perceivable by humans with sufficiently small error as to be visually identical (if presented faithfully), within the <b>available</b> <b>color</b> space [...] However, the digitization of color, either in a camera detector or on a screen, necessarily limits the <b>available</b> <b>color</b> space. Consequently there are many colors that may be impossible to reproduce, regardless of how many bits are used to represent the color. For example, it is impossible in typical RGB color spaces (common on computer monitors) to reproduce the full range of green colors that the human eye is capable of perceiving.|$|R
25|$|Agfa's {{similarly}} structured Agfacolor Neu {{was introduced}} in 1936. Unlike Kodachrome, the color couplers in Agfacolor Neu were incorporated into the emulsion layers during manufacture, which greatly simplified the processing. Currently, <b>available</b> <b>color</b> films still employ a multi-layer emulsion and the same principles, most closely resembling Agfa's product.|$|R
