2500|$|Robert Cooke of Drowned in Sound {{was also}} {{impressed}} and awarded {{a score of}} eight out of ten, despite stating it [...] "falls short of the dizzying intensity of its masterpiece of a predecessor." [...] He praised frontman Scott Hutchison in particular, describing his performance as still having the [...] "same tremble in the voice, the same elegance in the guitar tone, the same march of the Military Tattoo in the rhythm – but a renewed purpose". Free music magazine, The Fly, awarded the album four ½ out of five stars. Iain Moffat claimed that Scott Hutchison {{has one of the}} [...] "most underrated voices in rock" [...] as well as praising the [...] "lyrical sharpness" [...] of the album. He summarised his review by adding, [...] "what more could you possibly want from Frightened Rabbit’s third album? They’re hurling themselves fearlessly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> lights, and coming back all the stronger for it." [...] Dave Simpson of The Guardian praised the album's [...] "sharp" [...] songwriting, stating, [...] "most of their songs – with themes of escape, freedom and reinvention – have huge impassioned choruses that are made to be shouted from the nearest available mountain". Awarding four stars, he also added, [...] "The Rabbit are a band overdue a breakthrough, and fans of everyone from Arcade Fire to the similarly revamped Maccabees will find much to love here." ...|$|E

40|$|We study {{graphene}} grown {{across the}} boundary of three such grains having bright, medium, and dark color in reflection. Raman micro-spectroscopy proves presence of mostly a monoor bi-layer graphene on all the grains. Yet intensity of Raman 2 D band is grain-dependent: highest <b>at</b> <b>the</b> darkest grain and lowest <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> one. Contrary, conductive atomic force microscopy detects <b>the</b> highest conductivity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> grain and <b>the</b> lowest current <b>at</b> <b>the</b> darkest grain. This is attributed to dominant electrical current path through graphene and underlying oxide thickness of which also depends {{on the type of}} copper grain. We correlate and discuss the results with view to better understanding of graphene growth and electronic properties on large area copper substrates...|$|R
