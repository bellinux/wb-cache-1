500|$|The 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike, {{which began}} in November 2007, all but {{crippled}} the United States' entertainment industry. Virtually all scripted Hollywood shows were expected to shut down by the week of December 19, 2007. Hollywood journalist Nikki Finke reported, [...] "CEOs are determined to write off not just {{the rest of this}} TV season (including the Back 9 of scripted series), but also pilot season and the 2008/2009 schedule as well. Indeed, network orders for reality TV shows <b>are</b> <b>pouring</b> into the agencies right now." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 2007, {{an article}} in the Los Angeles Times stated that, [...] "Dishwashers, waiters and others whose jobs and {{dilapidated}} home addresses seem to make them unpromising targets for political fundraisers <b>are</b> <b>pouring</b> $1,000 and $2,000 contributions into Clinton's campaign treasury. In April, a single fundraiser in an area long known for its gritty urban poverty yielded a whopping $380,000." [...] The Times further stated, [...] "At this point in the presidential campaign cycle, Clinton has raised more money than any candidate in history. Those dishwashers, waiters and street stall hawkers are part of the reason. And Clinton's success in gathering money from Chinatown's least-affluent residents stems from a two-pronged strategy: mutually beneficial alliances with powerful groups, and appeals to the hopes and dreams of people now consigned to the margins." [...] The New York Post reported similar findings. [...] The Washington Post editorialized that reports such as these appear [...] "to be another instance in which a Clinton campaign's zeal for campaign cash overwhelms its judgment," [...] comparing it to the 1996 Clinton-Gore finance controversy of her husband.|$|E

60|$|It {{now appears}} that Banks got safely into Winchester last night, {{and is this}} morning {{retreating}} on Harper's Ferry. This justifies the inference that he is pressed by numbers superior to his own. I think it not improbable that Ewell, Jackson, and Johnson <b>are</b> <b>pouring</b> through the gap they made day before yesterday at Front Royal, making a dash northward. It {{will be a very}} valuable and very honorable service for General McDowell to cut them off. I hope he will put all possible energy and speed into the effort.|$|E

60|$|Now {{the name}} {{of all this is}} Anarchy. It not only does not know what it wants, but it does not even know what it hates. It multiplies {{excessively}} in the more American sort of English newspapers. When this new sort of New Englander burns a witch the whole prairie catches fire. These people have not the decision and detachment of the doctrinal ages. They cannot do a monstrous action and still see it is monstrous. Wherever they make a stride they make a rut. They cannot stop their own thoughts, though their thoughts <b>are</b> <b>pouring</b> into the pit.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} her. Here was a woman, {{of the finest}} grade of the English working-class, with {{numerous}} evidences of refinement, being slowly engulfed by that noisome and rotten tide of humanity which {{the powers that be}} <b>are</b> <b>pouring</b> eastward out of London Town. Bank, factory, hotel, and office building must go up, and the city poor folk are a nomadic breed; so they migrate eastward, wave upon wave, saturating and degrading neighbourhood by neighbourhood, driving the better class of workers before them to pioneer, {{on the rim of the}} city, or dragging them down, if not in the first generation, surely in the second and third.|$|E

He drops a great many knobs; but, being used to it, picks them up again with great dexterity, and, after wiping them on his sleeve, throws them back into the plates. He is a young man of exceedingly prepossessing appearance--either dirty or a mulatto, but I think the former.|$|E
