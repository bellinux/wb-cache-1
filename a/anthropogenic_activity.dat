Cetaceans which are extremely sensitive to noise are effectively being driven from their preferred coastal habitats by the use of acoustic devices. In poorer quality habitat, harbour porpoises are subjected to increased competition for resources. This situation is recognized as range contraction which can be a result of climate change, <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>activity,</b> or population decline. Large scale range contractions are considered indicative of impending extinction. A similar form of deterrent is noise pollution originating from vessel traffic.|$|E
500|$|Two {{changes to}} the global {{atmosphere}} due to <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>activity</b> threaten marine mammals. The first is increases in ultraviolet radiation due to ozone depletion, and this mainly affects the Antarctic and {{other areas of the}} southern hemisphere. An increase in ultraviolet radiation has the capacity to decrease phytoplankton abundance, which forms the basis of the food chain in the ocean. The second effect of global climate change is global warming due to increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. [...] Raised sea levels, sea temperature and changed currents are expected to affect marine mammals by altering the distribution of important prey species, and changing the suitability of breeding sites and migratory routes. The Arctic food chain would be disrupted by the near extinction or migration of polar bears. Arctic sea ice is the polar bear's habitat. It has been declining at a rate of 13% per decade because the temperature is rising at twice the rate {{of the rest of the}} world. By the year 2050, up to two-thirds of the world's polar bears may vanish if the sea ice continues to melt at its current rate.|$|E

40|$|The natural {{environment}} has been significantly affected by <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>activities.</b> Between 1700 s and 2000 s, agricultural land area had quintupled {{and the extent}} of natural vegetation was globally reduced by half. Furthermore many scientists argue that the recent rise in CO 2 levels in the atmosphere is mainly due to <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>activities.</b> <b>Anthropogenic</b> <b>activities</b> may also {{play a crucial role in}} the change of the hydro-climatologic variables. In this study, impact of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>activities</b> on two representative hydro-climatologic variables, temperature and streamflow, is investigated. The variations in temperature occur over larger spatial and time scale, and hence the United States is adopted for studying the impact on temperature. The continental United States includes most of the existing climate types in its large size and geographic variety. On the other hand, streamflow is affected by local environmental factors, including land cover condition and dam construction, and thus it is investigated based on a small regional area. ^ The three objectives of this study are to: (1) evaluate the impact of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>activities</b> on temperature in the continental U. S., and compare the impact of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>activities</b> with natural variability using the AR 4 climate models, (2) quantify the change in streamflow by considering both the natural factors and <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>activities,</b> and (3) investigate the impact of land cover change on extreme streamflow. ^ The first objective is to detect the changes in temperature in the continental United States (CONUS) and attribute these changes to <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>activities</b> by applying the Detection and Attribution methodology. The CONUS is divided into ten regions by using the K-mean clustering method. For each region, the Mann-Kendall trend analysis is used to examine the magnitude of change in observed temperature data as well as the data from eight climate models and an ensemble from all climate model outputs. Then the optimal fingerprint method is used to analyze the impact of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>activities</b> on temperature changes. The results show the trends in the observed temperature of the entire CONUS over the 20 th century lie inside the range expected from natural internal climate variability. In the regional analysis, the western U. S. is affected the most from the <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>activities,</b> based on both the results from the optimal fingerprint based detection and attribution analysis, and from comparison of trend between observed and simulated data using the Mann-Kendall test. ^ In the second objective, the roles of climate impact and <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>activities</b> on streamflow are evaluated using historical streamflow records, in conjunction with trend analysis and hydrologic modeling. In this study, four U. S. states, including Indiana, New York, Arizona and Georgia area used to represent various level of human activity based on population change and diverse climate conditions. Four hydrologic modeling methods, including linear regression, hydrologic simulation, annual balance, and Budyko analysis are then used to quantify the amount of climate impact and <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>activities</b> on streamflow. In conclusion, the results indicate that the impact of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>activities</b> is higher on streamflow at most gauging stations in all four states compared to climate impact. ^ The third objective is to investigate the effect of land cover change on the duration and severity of high and low flows by using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and copulas. High and low flows are defined in terms of percentiles of streamflow. Two watersheds, which have different dominant land covers within the Ohio River basin, are employed to carry out this study. The results show that land cover change explicitly affects the duration and severity of both high and low flows. Increase in the forest area leads to a decrease in the duration and severity in high flow; its significant impact is observed in extreme high flows. ^ Overall, the results presented in the dissertation indicate that the impact of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>activities</b> plays an important role in the hydrologic system and certainly should be considered for a better understanding of the hydrologic system. ...|$|R

The objectives {{of this study}} were to physically characterise unconsolidated soils and identify on-going <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>activities</b> on selected slopes in Dzanani in order to appraise their role as contributory factors in enhancing landslide susceptibility. Methods employed for this study comprised mapping, description of soil profile, identification of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>activities,</b> as well as experimental determination of soil colour, particle size distribution and Atterberg limits.

Analysis of the precipitation–runoff for the period 1970 – 2010 revealed breakpoints in 1986, 2000, 2004 and 2010 in the LPRB.
