5|$|Benzodiazepines share {{a similar}} {{chemical}} structure, {{and their effects}} in humans are mainly produced by the allosteric modification of a specific kind of neurotransmitter receptor, the GABAA receptor, which increases the overall conductance of these inhibitory channels; this results in the various therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines. Other less important mechanisms of <b>action</b> <b>are</b> also known.|$|E
5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central <b>action,</b> <b>are</b> in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} risk {{and severity of}} serotonergic side effects and serotonin toxicity, with individual drugs and combinations, is complex. Serotonin syndrome {{has been reported in}} patients of all ages, including the elderly, children, and even newborn infants due to in utero exposure. The serotonergic toxicity of SSRIs increases with dose, but even in over-dose it is insufficient to cause fatalities from serotonin syndrome in healthy adults. Elevations of central nervous system serotonin will typically only reach potentially fatal levels when drugs with different mechanisms of <b>action</b> <b>are</b> mixed together. Various drugs, other than SSRIs, also have clinically significant potency as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, (e.g. tramadol, amphetamine, and MDMA) and are associated with severe cases of the syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|At its simplest, a rule <b>is</b> a {{conditional}} <b>action.</b> The <b>action</b> can <b>be</b> anything {{appropriate to}} the domain. For augmenting web pages, <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> page modifiers. In other domains, the <b>action</b> can <b>be</b> whatever the endpoint can consume. When a rule's <b>action</b> <b>is</b> taken, we say that the rule [...] "fired." [...] Note that the <b>action</b> <b>is</b> conditional: the <b>action</b> <b>is</b> taken only when the rule is selected and its premise is true.|$|R
50|$|Imperative: The {{imperative}} mode {{is marked}} by several different morphemes, {{depending on how the}} <b>action</b> <b>is</b> to be carried out. /pi/ is used when the <b>action</b> <b>is</b> to be carried out {{in the presence of the}} speaker, as in cenopi Look!. /pada/ is used when the <b>action</b> <b>is</b> to be completed in the absence of the speaker.|$|R
50|$|Primary <b>action</b> <b>is</b> extorsion (external rotation); {{secondary}} <b>action</b> <b>is</b> elevation; tertiary <b>action</b> <b>is</b> abduction (i.e. it extorts the eye {{and moves}} it upward and outwards). The field of maximal inferior oblique elevation is in the adducted position.|$|R
5|$|The {{ships in}} the orders of battle below {{are listed in the}} order in which they {{appeared}} in the respective battle lines. Listed in the casualties section are the totals of killed and wounded as best as can be established: {{due to the nature of}} the battle, French losses were hard to calculate precisely. Officers killed in <b>action</b> <b>are</b> marked with a † symbol. Note that as carronades were not traditionally taken into consideration when calculating a ship's rate, these ships may have been carrying more guns than indicated below.|$|E
5|$|When {{a player}} is {{found by the}} umpire to have {{delivered}} the ball contrary to those rules, the umpire will call a no ball and {{he is said to}} have been called for throwing. Where public opinion is that a player's bowling action appears to be that he routinely throws, he is said to have a 'suspect' or an 'illegal' action, or more derogatorily, is said to be a 'chucker'. The issue is often highly emotive with accusers considering that deliveries with an illegal <b>action</b> <b>are</b> akin to cheating.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations with malicious intent could send {{information that could}} enable human civilization to destroy itself, such as powerful computer viruses or {{information on how to}} make extremely potent weapons that humans would not yet be able to use responsibly. While the motives for such an <b>action</b> <b>are</b> unknown, it would require minimal energy use {{on the part of the}} extraterrestrials. According to Musso, however, computer viruses in particular will be nearly impossible unless extraterrestrials possess detailed knowledge of human computer architectures, which would only happen if a human message sent to the stars were protected with little thought to security. Even a virtual machine on which extraterrestrials could run computer programs could be designed specifically for the purpose, bearing little relation to computer systems commonly used on Earth. In addition, humans could send messages to extraterrestrials detailing that they do not want access to the Encyclopædia Galactica until they have reached a suitable level of technological advancement, thus mitigating harmful impacts of extraterrestrial technology.|$|E
50|$|The {{dependent}} <b>action</b> <b>is</b> expressed with an adverbial participle. The main <b>action</b> <b>is</b> {{conveyed by}} the verb. If also the main <b>action</b> <b>is</b> conditional (a typical usage), {{than it can}} be expressed with a verb of conditional mood. The persons need not coincide.|$|R
2500|$|The {{bioavailability}} is 100% in intravenous (IV) injection, and {{the very}} rapid onset of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> seen within seconds. The T1/2 is 14.1 to 26.2 hours. The apparent volume of distribution is between 9.5 and 21.7 L/kg. [...] The duration of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> four to six hours. If haloperidol is given as a slow IV infusion, the onset of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> slowed, and the duration of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> prolonged.|$|R
25|$|The {{essential}} {{difference is}} in what determines {{whether or not}} an <b>action</b> <b>is</b> the right <b>action.</b> Act utilitarianism maintains that an <b>action</b> <b>is</b> right if it maximizes utility; rule utilitarianism maintains that an <b>action</b> <b>is</b> right if it conforms to a rule that maximizes utility.|$|R
5|$|The {{land that}} would become part of Sully was likely {{controlled}} by several groups before the Doeg claimed the area. English settlers encountered Algonquian language speaking members of the Doeg tribe in modern-day Northern Virginia. The Doeg are most well known for their raid in July 1675 that {{became a part of}} Bacon's Rebellion. English colonists settling in modern Northern Virginia came into conflict with the Doeg from 1661 to 1664. When diplomatic attempts failed, the governor sent the Rappahannock County militia in June 1666. The specifics of that military <b>action</b> <b>are</b> unclear, but later land grants to English settlers are not disputed, suggesting the English gained control of the area. The English presumptively took control after a violent conflict with the Doeg in 1666. Little is recorded about the disposition of this land from the time when the English gained control of it until the land is patented by the Lee family of Virginia.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, {{there are}} six phases in the game where players may take <b>actions.</b> There <b>are</b> 10 <b>actions</b> the players may take during these seasons, the order of which is {{randomly}} decided {{at the beginning of}} each season.
