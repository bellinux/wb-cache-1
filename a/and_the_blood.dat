5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is a clinical diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct {{measurement of the}} pressure in a fascial compartment, {{and the difference between}} this pressure <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> pressure, may be used to assess its severity. High pressures in the compartment and a small difference between compartment pressure and blood pressure indicate that the blood supply is likely to be insufficient, and that surgical intervention may be needed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the arrival of an arterial bubble in a de-saturating neurological tissue. The bubble exchanges gas with the surrounding tissue <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood.</b> If the bubble does not exceed a critical radius, it will eventually leave the site without growing, otherwise it will block the blood circulation and cause ischemia. The critical parameter is bubble radius. This criterion is used to prevent type II neurological symptoms. The strategy for a safe rate of ascent at this stage is to balance gas exchange.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms of {{diabetes}} insipidus should prompt a formal fluid deprivation test {{to assess the}} body's response to dehydration, which normally causes concentration of the urine and increasing osmolarity of the blood. If these parameters are unchanged, desmopressin (an ADH analogue) is administered. If the urine then becomes concentrated <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> osmolarity falls, {{there is a lack}} of ADH due to lack of pituitary function ("cranial diabetes insipidus"). In contrast, there is no change if the kidneys are unresponsive to ADH due to a different problem ("nephrogenic diabetes insipidus").|$|E

5|$|Antioxidants are {{classified}} into two broad divisions, {{depending on whether}} they are soluble in water (hydrophilic) or in lipids (lipophilic). In general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell cytosol <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> plasma, while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect cell membranes from lipid peroxidation. These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet. The different antioxidants are present at {{a wide range of}} concentrations in body fluids and tissues, with some such as glutathione or ubiquinone mostly present within cells, while others such as uric acid are more evenly distributed (see table below). Some antioxidants are only found in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in pathogens and can be virulence factors.|$|E
5|$|Brood {{parasitism}} by brown-headed cowbirds is common, {{with up to}} 25% of Carolina wren nests {{being affected}} in certain regions such as Oklahoma and Alabama. Cowbird parasitism peaks in April at 41%, and is as low as 8% and 0% in July and August, respectively. Female cowbirds sometimes eject Carolina wren eggs before laying their own, and even if host eggs are retained, the size of cowbird eggs negatively affect the hatching success of wren eggs. As a result, cowbirds may {{have a significant impact}} on the reproductive success of wrens. The feeding rate for cowbird nestlings is higher than wren feeding rates, and some have been raised to independence. This also can be detrimental to the survival of wren nestlings. A rare instance of brood-parasitism by a house finch has been recorded. The rate of brood parasitism is thought to be lower in more natural and concealed nesting locations. Body parasites such as the larvae of blowflies feed on nestlings <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> loss weakens nestlings. Fellow species of wren such as Bewick's wren and the winter wren compete for nesting locations and food, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Late Registration is {{the second}} studio album by American hip hop {{producer}} and rapper Kanye West. It was recorded {{over the course of}} a year in sessions held across studios in New York City and Hollywood, with West collaborating with American record producer and composer Jon Brion. The album features guest contributions from Adam Levine, Lupe Fiasco, Jamie Foxx, Common, Jay-Z, Brandy, and Nas, among others. Its production was notably more lush and elaborate than West's 2004 debut album The College Dropout, as he utilized intricate sampling methods and string orchestration with Brion. West's lyrics explore both personal and political themes, including poverty, drug trafficking, racism, healthcare, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> diamond trade.|$|E

5|$|Organofluorines exhibit biopersistence {{due to the}} {{strength}} of the carbon–fluorine bond. Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), which are sparingly water-soluble owing to their acidic functional groups, are noted persistent organic pollutants; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are most often researched. PFAAs have been found in trace quantities worldwide from polar bears to humans, with PFOS and PFOA known to reside in breast milk <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> of newborn babies. A 2013 review showed a slight correlation between groundwater and soil PFAA levels and human activity; there was no clear pattern of one chemical dominating, and higher amounts of PFOS were correlated to higher amounts of PFOA. In the body, PFAAs bind to proteins such as serum albumin; they tend to concentrate within humans in the liver and blood before excretion through the kidneys. Dwell time in the body varies greatly by species, with half-lives of days in rodents, and years in humans. High doses of PFOS and PFOA cause cancer and death in newborn rodents but human studies have not established an effect at current exposure levels.|$|E
5|$|The Eucharistic celebration, {{also called}} the Mass or Divine liturgy, {{includes}} prayers and scriptural readings, {{as well as an}} offering of bread and wine, which are brought to the altar and consecrated by the priest to become the body <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> of Jesus Christ, a change called transubstantiation. The words of consecration reflect the words spoken by Jesus during the Last Supper, where Christ offered his body and blood to his Apostles the night before his crucifixion. The sacrament re-presents (makes present) the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross, and perpetuates it. Christ's death and resurrection gives grace through the sacrament that unites the faithful with Christ and one another, remits venial sin, and aids against committing moral sin (though mortal sin itself is forgiven through the sacrament of penance).|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{physician}} Galen (2nd century CE) knew {{blood vessels}} carried blood and identified venous (dark red) and arterial (brighter and thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions. Galen, noting the heart as the hottest organ in the body, {{concluded that it}} provided heat to the body. The heart did not pump blood around, the heart's motion sucked blood in during diastole <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves. Galen believed the arterial blood was created by venous blood passing from the left ventricle to the right through 'pores' between the ventricles. Air from the lungs passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery {{to the left side}} of the heart and created arterial blood.|$|E

5|$|The {{biochemical}} {{basis for}} the toxicity of oxygen is the partial reduction of oxygen by one or two electrons to form reactive oxygen species, which are natural by-products of the normal metabolism of oxygen and have important roles in cell signalling. One species produced by the body, the superoxide anion (−), is possibly involved in iron acquisition. Higher than normal concentrations of oxygen lead to increased levels of reactive oxygen species. Oxygen is necessary for cell metabolism, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> supplies it to {{all parts of the}} body. When oxygen is breathed at high partial pressures, a hyperoxic condition will rapidly spread, with the most vascularised tissues being most vulnerable. During times of environmental stress, levels of reactive oxygen species can increase dramatically, which can damage cell structures and produce oxidative stress.|$|E
5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} {{has generally}} nocturnal habits and {{spends much of}} the day buried in the substrate. It has been known to follow the rising tide to forage in water barely deep enough to cover its body. This species preys upon small invertebrates, including crustaceans, annelid worms, and bivalve and gastropod molluscs, and bony fishes. It mainly targets benthic and burrowing organisms, but also opportunistically takes free-swimming prey. In Delaware Bay, this species feeds predominantly on the shrimp Cragon septemspinosa <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> worm Glycera dibranchiata, and its overall dietary composition is virtually identical to that of the roughtail stingray (D.centroura), with which it shares the bay. The bluntnose stingray is preyed upon by larger fishes such as the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas). Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium brevissime and Kotorella pronosoma, the monogenean Listrocephalos corona, and the trematodes Monocotyle pricei and Multicalyx cristata.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} teleost is denser than water, so fish must {{compensate}} for the difference or they will sink. Many teleosts have a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases {{to allow them to}} stay at the current water depth, or ascend or descend without having to waste energy in swimming. In the more primitive groups like some minnows, the swim bladder is open to the esophagus and doubles as a lung. It is often absent in fast-swimming fishes such as the tuna and mackerel. In fish where the swim bladder is closed, the gas content is controlled through the rete mirabilis, a network of blood vessels serving as a countercurrent gas exchanger between the swim bladder <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood.</b> The Chondrostei such as sturgeons also have a swim bladder, but this appears to have evolved separately: other Actinopterygii such as the bowfin and the bichir do not have one, so swim bladders appear to have arisen twice, and the teleost swim bladder is not homologous with the chondrostean one.|$|E

5|$|The {{conjugation}} of the {{new field}} colours, especially the use of green, was not traditional in the Portuguese national flag's composition and represented a radical republican-inspired change that broke the bond with the former monarchical flag. Since a failed republican insurrection on 31 January 1891, red and green had been established as the colours of the Portuguese Republican Party and its associated movements, whose political prominence kept growing until it reached a culmination period following the Republican revolution of 5 October 1910. In the ensuing decades, these colours were popularly propagandized as representing {{the hope of the}} nation (green) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> (red) of those who died defending it, as a means to endow them with a more patriotic and dignified, therefore less political, sentiment. Although the flag flown from the Oporto city hall in the morning of 31 January 1891, symbol of the republican uprising was red and green. Totally red with a green circle in the center, to which were added the inscriptions referring to the republican center to whom it belonged - the Centro Democrático Federal 15 de Novembro.|$|E
5|$|The major {{function}} of the lungs is gas exchange between the lungs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood.</b> The alveolar and pulmonary capillary gases equilibrate across the blood–air barrier, a very thin diffusion membrane which is only, on average, about 2μm thick, consisting of {{the walls of the}} pulmonary alveoli, consisting of the alveolar epithelial cells, their basement membranes and the endothelial cells of the pulmonary capillaries. This membrane is folded into about 300 million small air sacs called alveoli (each between 75 and 300µm in diameter) branching off from the bronchioles in the lungs, thus providing an extremely large surface area (estimates varying between 70 and 145m2) for gas exchange to occur.|$|E
5|$|The right heart {{collects}} deoxygenated {{blood from}} two large veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. Blood collects {{in the right}} and left atrium continuously. The superior vena cava drains blood from above the diaphragm and empties into the upper back part of the right atrium. The inferior vena cava drains the blood from below the diaphragm and empties into the back part of the atrium below the opening for the superior vena cava. Immediately above and {{to the middle of the}} opening of the inferior vena cava is the opening of the thin-walled coronary sinus. Additionally, the coronary sinus returns deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the right atrium. The blood collects in the right atrium. When the right atrium contracts, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> is pumped into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve. The pulmonary trunk divides into pulmonary arteries and progressively smaller arteries throughout the lungs, until it reaches capillaries. As these pass by alveoli carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. This happens through the passive process of diffusion.|$|E

5|$|The roughtail {{stingray}} is reportedly not highly active, spending much time {{buried in the}} sediment. It is a generalist predator whose diet generally reflects the most available prey in its environment. It mainly captures prey off the bottom, but also opportunistically takes free-swimming prey. A variety of invertebrates, as well as bony fishes such as sand lance and scup, {{are known to be}} consumed. Off Massachusetts, the main prey are crabs (Cancer), bivalves (Mya), gastropods (Polinices), squid (Loligo) and annelid worms. In Delaware Bay, most of its diet consists of the shrimp Cragon septemspinosa <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> worm Glycera dibranchiata; the overall dietary composition there is nearly identical to that of bluntnose stingrays (D. say) that share the bay. The shrimp Upogebia affinis is a major food source off Virginia. Off Florida, crustaceans (Rananoides, Ovalipes, Sicyonia brevirostris, and Portunus) and polychaete worms are the most important prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} {{produced by}} AVMs {{in the liver}} depend {{on the type of}} abnormal connection that they form between blood vessels. If the connection is between arteries and veins, a large amount of blood bypasses the body's organs, for which the heart compensates by increasing the cardiac output. Eventually congestive cardiac failure develops ("high-output cardiac failure"), with breathlessness and leg swelling among other problems. If the AVM creates a connection between the portal vein <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> vessels of the liver, the result may be portal hypertension (increased portal vein pressure), in which collateral blood vessels form in the esophagus (esophageal varices), which may bleed violently; furthermore, the increased pressure may give rise to fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity (ascites). If the flow in the AVM is in the other direction, portal venous blood flows directly into the veins rather than running through the liver; this may lead to hepatic encephalopathy (confusion due to portal waste products irritating the brain). Rarely, the bile ducts are deprived of blood, leading to severe cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts). Liver AVMs are detectable in over 70% of people with HHT, but only 10% experience problems as a result.|$|E
5|$|Varno said he {{received}} uncredited assistance from {{his friends and}} fellow screenwriters Jerome Bixby and Harold Jacob Smith, the latter of whom won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film The Defiant Ones (1958). Varno ran lines and ideas by both men and sought advice. Smith in particular inspired lines for the speech made by the monster {{at the end of}} the film, in which the creature discusses how the human characters consider him the embodiment of evil simply because he is different from them. Varno said much of that dialogue from Smith, however, ended up getting cut from the final film. One of the primary themes of the film, as embodied in John Corcoran's attempts to defend the alien creature, was that simply because someone or something is ugly or different does not necessarily make it evil. However, the script also followed a common trait of most horror films of the 1950s that even somewhat understandable monsters are not entirely sympathetic, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blood</b> Beast creature proves itself evil by impregnating Corcoran against his will and pursuing world domination.|$|E
