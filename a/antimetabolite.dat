5|$|The exosome {{has been}} shown to be {{inhibited}} by the <b>antimetabolite</b> fluorouracil, a drug used in the chemotherapy of cancer. It is one of the most successful drugs for treating solid tumors. In yeast cells treated with fluorouracil, defects were found in the processing of ribosomal RNA identical to those seen when the activity of the exosome was blocked by molecular biological strategies. Lack of correct ribosomal RNA processing is lethal to cells, explaining the antimetabolic effect of the drug.|$|E

50|$|Antifolates, such as pralatrexate, {{are part}} of a group of {{compounds}} known as <b>antimetabolites</b> with structural similarity to naturally occurring molecules involved in DNA synthesis.

40|$|Purpose: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the intraoperative application of <b>antimetabolites</b> compared with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents with or without <b>antimetabolites</b> in trabeculectomy (Trab) for glaucoma. Methods: Relevant studies were selected through extensive search using PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases in August 2013. The primary efficacy estimate was measured using weighted mean difference {{of the percentage of}} intraocular pressure reduction (IOPR%) from baseline to end-point, and the secondary efficacy estimates were odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) for complete success rate and qualified success rate. ORs were also used to measure the tolerability estimate for adverse events. Meta-analyses of fixed or random effects models were conducted using RevMan software 5. 2 to pool the results of the studies included. Heterogeneity was assessed using Chi 2 test and the I 2 measure. Results: Nine studies enrolling a total of 349 patients were included. The weighted mean difference of IOPR % from baseline was 7. 23 (95 % CI: 2. 57 – 11. 89) for <b>antimetabolites</b> vs. anti-VEGF agents and 3. 96 (95 % CI: 24. 18 – 12. 10) for <b>antimetabolites</b> vs. anti-VEGF agents plus <b>antimetabolites.</b> The pooled ORs comparing <b>antimetabolites</b> with anti-VEGF agents were 2. 37 (95 % CI: 0. 78, 7. 21) for the complete success rate and 1. 93 (95 % CI: 0. 52, 7. 16) for qualified success rate.

Azathioprine is in the purine analogue and <b>antimetabolite</b> family of medication. It works via 6-thioguanine to disrupt the making of RNA and DNA by cells.|$|E
25|$|Methotrexate is an <b>antimetabolite</b> of the antifolate type. It {{is thought}} to affect cancer and {{rheumatoid}} arthritis by two different pathways. For cancer, methotrexate competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that participates in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis. The affinity of methotrexate for DHFR is about 1000-fold that of folate. DHFR catalyses the conversion of dihydrofolate to the active tetrahydrofolate. Folic acid is needed for the denovo synthesis of the nucleoside thymidine, required for DNA synthesis. Also, folate is essential for purine and pyrimidine base biosynthesis, so synthesis will be inhibited. Methotrexate, therefore, inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, thymidylates, and proteins.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Owing to its {{technical}} refinements, "modern" trabeculectomy aims {{to reduce}} the incidence and severity of early postoperative complications while increasing postop IOP success. The purpose of our study was to evaluate namely the safety of "modern" trabeculectomy, {{the quality of the}} filtration blebs, the influence on the quality of life and secondarily IOP reduction according to the surgical procedure whether augmented with peroperative application of <b>antimetabolites</b> or not. MATERIAL-METHODS: Retrospective study including our 45 first consecutive procedures in 38 patients (mean age: 61. 1 years) with medically uncontrolled various glaucomas. All procedures were performed according to a modified P. Khaw's protocol. <b>Antimetabolites</b> were applied peroperatively in 28 / 45 eyes (62. 2 %) with a history of previous filtering surgery (12 / 28 eyes) and/or advanced glaucomatous damage (22 / 28 eyes). <b>Antimetabolites</b> were not used in the 17 / 45 other eyes with lower surgical risk factors and higher target IOP, surgical procedure was not augmented with <b>antimetabolites.</b> Postoperative management included laser suture lysis, withdrawal of adjustable sutures and 5 -FU injections when needed. Complete ocular examination was carried out preoperatively and postoperatively at day 1, 7, at 1, 2 and 3 months and every 3 months thereafter. All patients were questioned for symptoms associated with filtration bleb dysesthesia at the last visit. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 7. 9 +/- 3. 3 in the group without antimetbolites and 5. 3 +/- 2. 2 months in the group with <b>antimetabolites</b> (p 0. 05). 1 st month postoperative complications were transient and minor. They occurred in 59 % in the group without <b>antimetabolites</b> and in 68 % in the subgroup augmented with <b>antimetabolites.</b> Complications had comparable frequency of distribution between the 2 subgroups (p > 0. 05). 84 % of the filtration blebs (30 / 45) were diffuse and mildly vascularized. Avascular blebs were noticed in 7 eyes (15. 5 %) and were not related with the intraoperative application of mitomycin C (p > 0. 05). Subjective comfort was good to excellent in 42 / 45 eyes (93. 3 %). Mean final visual acuity was not altered compared with preop level (p > 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Our short term results suggest that the safety of "modern" trabeculectomy augmented with <b>antimetabolites</b> is comparable to those without intraoperative <b>antimetabolites.</b> Filtration blebs were very well tolerated in most patients. The peroperative use of <b>antimetabolites</b> precludes to appreciate if the success rates are due to the use of <b>antimetabolites</b> and/or the technique per se...|$|R

40|$|In 1958 Schwartz eta/. first {{described}} the suppressive effect on antibody formation in rabbits of the purine antagonist 5 -mercaptopurine (1). Stimulated by this finding {{a number of}} investigators have studied the effect of different <b>antimetabolites</b> on antibody formation (2 - 4) and on delayed hypersensitivity (5, 6) in various animal species. These findings are not only of theoretical interest, but have become of practical importance in homotransplantafion (7 - 9), {{in the treatment of}} autoimmune disorders in man (10, 11), and in experimental animals (12). The action of <b>antimetabolites</b> on the immune response differs from species to species. 6 -mercaptopurine (6 -MP) and aminopterin have both been reported to inhibit delayed hypersensitivity in the guinea pig (5, 13). In contrast, antibody formation in this animal was only suppressed by aminopterin (13, 14). Thus the mechanism of action of these two compounds on the immune response in guinea pigs appears to be different. For this reason it seemed of interest to study and compare the effect of these two <b>antimetabolites</b> on an experimental immune disease in this species.

40|$|Summary It {{is almost}} 50 years since <b>antimetabolites</b> were first {{found to have}} {{clinical}} antitumour activity, with Farber's discovery that aminopterin could cause remission in acute leukaemia. In the following 10 years, methotrexate, 6 -mercaptopurine and 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) {{found their way into}} clinical practice. Subsequently, cytosine arabinoside was found to have activity in acute leukaemia, but, until recently, other significant developments have involved optimizing the efficacy of existing <b>antimetabolites,</b> including the use of leucovorin with methotrexate or 5 -FU. Recently, new <b>antimetabolites</b> have become a fertile area for anti-cancer drug research. Gemcitabine (GEMZAR®) has emerged as an important new agent in several tumour types, including pancreatic, non-small-cell lung, bladder, breast and ovarian cancers. Capecitabine is an intriguing new prodrug, offering tumour selectivity and prolonged tumour exposure to 5 -FU. More potent thymidylate synthase inhibitors have also emerged; raltitrexed is now commercially available for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Others under development include LY 231514, which has other sites of action, hence the acronym MTA (multi-targeted antifolate). A novel target is glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT) and LY 309887 and AG 2034 are undergoing clinical investigation as GARFT inhibitors. A critical element with LY 309887 appears to be co-administration of folate. It seems entirely possible that several novel <b>antimetabolites</b> will establish themselves in clinical practice in future for the treatment of solid tumours.
