When they read about a former pupil who has become head of ICI, they always say, 'But that boy's an idiot. He's crap at geography.' The boy is condemned forever because in the 1960s he didn't know all the capitals of the Third World.|$|E

2500|$|Such was the {{popularity}} of Gordon that the first critical book by a British author was not published until 1908, when Baring [...] by this time raised to the peerage as Viscount Cromer [...] published his autobiography, which was notable as the first British book to portray Gordon in an unflattering manner, though Lord Cromer also tried {{to be fair and}} emphasised what he felt were Gordon's positive, as well as his negative, traits. About the charge that if only Gladstone had listened to Gordon the disaster would have been avoided, Cromer wrote that in the course of one month, he received five telegrams from Gordon offering his advice, each one of which completely contradicted the previous telegram, leading Cromer to charge that Gordon was too mercurial a figure to hold command. As a young man, Winston Churchill shared in the national consensus that Gordon was one of Britain's greatest heroes. During a meeting in 1898 in Cairo where Churchill interviewed Baring to gather material for his 1899 book The River War, Baring challenged Churchill about his belief that Gordon was a hero. After his conversation with Baring, Churchill wrote: [...] "Of course {{there is no doubt that}} Gordon as a political figure was absolutely hopeless. He was so erratic, capricious, utterly unreliable, his mood changed so often, his temper was abominable, he was frequently drunk, and yet with all that he had <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> honour and great abilities".|$|E

50|$|Sohrab Merwanji Modi {{was born}} 2 November 1897 in Bombay. After {{finishing}} school, he became travelling exhibitor in Gwalior {{with his brother}} Keki Modi. At 16 he used project films in Gwalior's Town Hall and at 26 set up his Arya Subhodh Theatrical Company. Sohrab began as a Parsi theatre actor with some experience in silent films. He earned quite {{a reputation as a}} Shakespearean actor, travelling throughout India with his brother's theatrical company and enjoying the <b>tremendous</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> fulfillment every time the curtain came down and the audience applauded. However, {{with the advent of the}} sound film in 1931, theatre was declining. To rescue this dying art, Modi set up the Stage Film Company in 1935. His first two films were filmed versions of plays. Khoon Ka Khoon (1935) was an adaptation of Hamlet and marked Naseem Bano's acting debut. The second, Said-e-Havas (1936) was based on Shakespeare's King John. Both films failed.|$|R

40|$|The {{advance of}} {{nanomaterials}} has opened new opportunities to develop ever more sensitive sensors owing to their high surface-to-volume ratio. However, {{it is challenging to}} achieve intrinsic sensitivities of nanomaterials for ultra-low level detections {{due to their}} vulnerability against contaminations. Here we show that despite considerable achievements in the last decade, continuous in situ cleaning of carbon nanotubes with ultraviolet light during gas sensing can still dramatically enhance their performance. For instance in nitric oxide detection, while sensitivity in air is improved two orders of magnitude, under controlled environment it reaches a detection limit of 590 parts-per-quadrillion (ppq) at room temperature. Furthermore, aiming for practical applications we illustrate how to address gas selectivity by introducing a gate bias. The concept of continuous in situ cleaning not only reveals the <b>tremendous</b> <b>sensing</b> potential <b>of</b> pristine carbon nanotubes but also more importantly it can be applied to other nanostructures...|$|R

40|$|For most {{teachers}} entering the profession, {{the early years}} are marked by a steep learning curve with energies directed toward mastering the curriculum, learning to pace instruction, discovering how best to manage students, fitting into {{the culture of the}} school, and establishing positive relationships with students and colleagues. So, naturally, for these beginning professionals, their sole focus is learning the fundamentals of teaching (Greenlee and deDeugd 2002). As teachers begin to master the art and skill of teaching, develop effective personalized teaching styles, and feel confident, they begin to shift their thinking from basic survival to their personal career development, sometimes wondering whether a teaching career, with a focus at the classroom level, is their ultimate niche or whether they should consider another career path. For a significant number of people, teaching is their passion. They could not imagine being anywhere but the classroom. The joys as well as the challenges they experience every day only reinforce their need to focus their careers exclusively on teaching. What typically distinguishes these faculty members from those who may look beyond the classroom is the <b>tremendous</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> daily self-fulfillment they experience helping children succeed. Not surprisingly, what often drives their career development is a desire to be master teachers. These individuals, who are {{the heart and soul of}} the best in education, look to relate career development with teaching success (Bell and Gilbert 1996; Levin 2003; Conner 2004). While the majority of teachers choose to remain classroom focused, others may experience a desire to step outside the classroom and seek out other career options within the field of education. When these feelings begin to emerge, teachers often start to ask themselves what other opportunities are available.
