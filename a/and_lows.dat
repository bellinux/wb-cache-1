40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} {{prevalence and}} causes of blindness <b>and</b> <b>low</b> vision of type 2 diabetes(T 2 DM) in Yangxin county, Hubei province. METHODS: A total of 8 316 permanent residents, {{to carry out}} epidemiological survey of blindness <b>and</b> <b>low</b> vision. Carolina First T 2 DM patients were in the observation group, the other subjects admitted to the control group. Prevalence and etiology of blind <b>and</b> <b>low</b> vision were compared. Then the data only in the observation group were analyzed. RESULTS:The rate of blindness <b>and</b> <b>low</b> vision appeared significantly higher, cataracts and retinopathy appeared significantly higher. With the increases of age, prevalence of blindness <b>and</b> <b>low</b> vision appeared significantly increased in the observation group. The rate of low vision was higher in women.

The club bounced back to ensure top flight football {{at the start of the}} 1950s. Napoli moved to their new home ground Stadio San Paolo in 1959. Despite erratic league form with highs <b>and</b> <b>lows</b> during this period, including a further relegation and promotion, Napoli had some cup success when they beat SPAL to lift the Coppa Italia in 1962, with goals from Gianni Corelli and Pierluigi Ronzon.

Kicker Jud Dunlevy had been the third-most accurate kicker in the nation heading into the Orange Bowl, having hit 21 of his 24field goal attempts during the season.

Fully aware of their daughter's occupation, Kim's parents remain completely supportive of her crime-fighting endeavors so long as she continues to obey curfew, but tend to be more-so concerned about the character's performance in school, as well as her love life. Lacking a secret identity, Kim is world famous and her profession, although accepted by her peers, is seldom acknowledged by her schoolmates or teachers. Captain of her high school's cheerleading squad, Kim Possible also explores the highs <b>and</b> <b>lows</b> of Kim's life as a high school student attempting to navigate dating, academics, homework, exams and eventually learning to drive, all the while striving to maintain a healthy work-life balance; fighting crime typically comes to Kim more naturally than the more standard components of adolescence.|$|E
5|$|The wolf is a {{frequent}} charge in English armory. It is illustrated as a supporter on the shields of Lord Welby, Rendel, and Viscount Wolseley, {{and can be found}} on the coat of arms of Lovett and the vast majority of the Wilsons <b>and</b> <b>Lows.</b> The demi-wolf is a common crest, appearing in the arms and crests of members of many families, including that of the Wolfes, whose crest depicts a demi-wolf holding a crown in its paws, in reference to the assistance the family gave to Charles II during the battle of Worcester. Wolf heads are common in Scottish heraldry, particularly in the coats of Clan Robertson and Skene. The wolf is the most common animal in Spanish heraldry, and is often depicted as carrying a lamb in its mouth, or across its back. The wolf is featured on the flags of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin and the Pawnee. In modern times, the wolf is widely used as an emblem for military and paramilitary groups. It is the unofficial symbol of the spetsnaz, and serves as the logo of the Turkish Grey Wolves. During the Yugoslav Wars, several Serb paramilitary units adopted the wolf as their symbol, including the White Wolves and the Wolves of Vučjak.|$|E

25|$|The {{climate of}} Westchester County is {{primarily}} regarded as humid continental (Koppen Dfa), and is somewhat cooler than the humid subtropical climate (Koppen Cfa) of New York City, sometimes {{by as much}} as 15°F. Winters are cold throughout the county and summers are hot inland but cooler towards the coast. Precipitation is plentiful and in some areas reaches over 45inches. Snowfall is more common in Westchester than in New York City, {{with the exception of the}} southwest of the county where snowfall is often between 40 and 60inches. In January, less dense areas have a low of 16-18°F and a high of 30–34°F while dense areas like Yonkers and White Plains have a low of 20–25°F and a high of 35-40°F. In the summer, this effect is much milder. Coastal areas (Mamaroneck, New Rochelle, Rye, Port Chester) have highs of 80–83°F <b>and</b> <b>lows</b> of 62–66°F, while inland highs will be 84–86°F <b>and</b> <b>lows</b> will be 60-66°F.
