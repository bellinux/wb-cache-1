40|$|Titanium alloys due {{to their}} {{properties}} are of great interest {{for use as a}} structural material for the parts of friction units, pump plungers, shaft-bush parts operating in harsh environments. But high tendency of titanium alloys to the contact seizure under friction restricts wider application of titanium and its alloys. One of the main ways to improve the <b>anti-friction</b> <b>properties</b> of titanium alloys is a chemical heat treatment. The most common type is nitrogen hardening that allows us to achieve high values of micro-hardness on the surface. However, the biggest drawback of the method is small depth of the hardened layer that is up to 0. 16 mm. To increase a depth of the hardened layer the paper proposes the preprocessing of the part surface by deformational cutting, which allows creating a macro-relief of different shape as the alternate vertical or inclined layers of the part material of a specified thickness and height with a gap or no gap between the layers. Doping of this structure, when nitriding, is provided over the entire macro-pattern surface, thereby enabling to obtain a thickness of the hardened layer, which depends on the processing parameters in deformational cutting. The paper presents the results of the microstructure study and the micro-hardness measurements of the VT 1 - 0 titanium alloy sample after deformational cutting process followed by nitriding. The influence of the deformational cutting parameters on the total thickness of the hardened surface layer is analyzed. It is found that the entire surface of macro-pattern has been azotized. The total thickness of the nitrogen hardened modified surface structure became 4 times larger as compared to the flat surface that was azotized.

40|$|Abstract: Titanium and Titanium –based alloys {{have been}} used for {{aerospace}} materials for many years. Recently, those alloys are now being increasingly utilised for automotive, industrial, chemical, energy industries and consumer applications because of its excellent tensile and fatigue strength, corrosion resistance and high toughness- to- mass ratio, temperature strength and Young modulus’s values. However, despite these numerous applications, their general usages are often restricted because of limitations in mechanical <b>properties</b> and poor <b>anti-friction</b> <b>properties</b> exhibited in selected service conditions. There are different rapid solidification methods that have been put forward by some authors to address these deficiencies. Laser Metal Deposition has the potential to offer all specific solutions to key engineering problems over the traditional metal-working techniques. However, the purpose of this research work focuses on the laser metal deposition of CpTi /TiC composites coatings on Ti 6 A 14 V as a substrate by the laser melting of CpTi and TiC elemental powder mixtures. The process parameters involved with the LMD method include the laser power, traverse speed, powder-flow rate, and gas-flow rates. The characterization was done using OM, SEM, EDS, microhardness and tensile testing. The laser power was varied between 800 W to 1600 W, while all the other parameters were kept constant. The results show that as laser power increases, the average hardness and the strength values also increase continuously. The results revealed that the microhardness values increases from 383 HV 0. 1 for the substrate and they reach a peak as high as 460 HV 0. 1 for sample A 3 and the lowest value of 364 HV 0. 1 for sample A 2. The tensile test showed that the average UTS for the four samples were 1545. 18 MPa while the YTS and the percentage elongation were 932. 60 MPa and 67 % respectively.

30|$|With rapid {{development}} of nanomaterial technology and stable growth of difficulties which exist for sources of energy, researchers {{have started to}} apply nanomaterial technology {{in the field of}} increasing heat transfer for the purpose of developing homogenous and stable heat transfer fluids. Nanofluids are produced by dispersing nanoparticles inside typical heat transfer fluids such as water, ethylene glycol, and oil[4]. Recently, an increase in the thermal conductivity coefficient of nanofluids which contain a little amount of metallic particles like Cu or nonmetallic particles like ZnO, Al 2 O 3, CuO, and SiC had also been reported. The natural potential of nanomaterials which are dispersed in base fluids for heat transfer also has an important effect on the rate of increase in thermal conductivity coefficient of nanofluids. For example, carbon nanotubes, due to their high thermal conductivity coefficient, are known as an ideal material for making nanofluids[5]. Hwang et al. have studied the heat transfer properties of nanofluids in water base and ethylene glycol base which contain CuO nanoparticles and multiwalled carbon nanotubes. They used transient hot wire method for measuring the thermal conductivity coefficient of nanofluids. In the case of nanofluids which contain CuO nanoparticles, their results showed that the increase of nanofluid thermal conductivity in the ethylene glycol base was more than that of the distilled water base nanofluid. Also, the thermal conductivity of distilled water base nanofluid which contains MWCNTs increased at the rate of 11.3 % in 0.01 volume fraction[6]. Totally improving the properties of a lubricant is a very important factor for saving total energy given to a mechanical system[7]. Nanoparticles also, due to their unique properties as a new kind of additive material for the purpose of improving the properties of lubricants, are very interesting and have attracted attention[8]. So far, the anti-wear and <b>anti-friction</b> <b>properties</b> of different nanolubricants[9, 10, 11, 12] and also the heat transfer properties of fluids which contain different nanostructures[6, 13, 14] had been studied by many researchers. So, in the present research, we are surveying the effect of CuO nanoparticles on the other properties of engine oil such as viscosity {{as one of the most}} important factors which are used for correct selection of the required oil in a lubricating system and also flash point and pour point as the properties which are related to the quality of oil functionality in different work conditions.|$|R
30|$|The {{wear scar}} diameters (WSD) {{of the steel}} disc that is {{lubricated}} by different oil samples are shown in Fig.  4 b. It demonstrates that the wear scar diameters are obviously decreased with adding WS 2 nanosheets. As the additive concentration is 0  %, the WSD is close to 0.35  mm. With increasing the additive concentration to 0.5  wt.%, the WSD decreases to 0.25  mm. When WS 2 nanosheet concentration increases to 1.0  wt.%, the WSD is smallest and is about 0.2  mm, which is nearly 43  % reduction for the WSD of the pure base oil. But, if the additive concentration is further increased to 2.0 or 5.0  wt.%, the WSD presents a larger trend. Therefore, we can conclude {{that there is an}} optimum concentration for WS 2 corresponding to 1.0  wt.% for their anti-wear abilities. At the same time, all of these results demonstrate that the ultrathin WS 2 nanosheets can greatly improve the <b>anti-friction</b> and anti-wear <b>properties</b> of 500 SN oil.|$|R
40|$|My work {{focused on}} the {{fabrication}} of superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) by deposition of Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles (NPs) and chemical modification with fluoroalkylsilanes (FAS). I synthesized Al 2 O 3 NPs via sol-gel method in water or isopropyl alcohol, assessing {{the differences between the}} suspensions in physicochemical properties and coating effectiveness on different materials. In some cases, the dispersant {{played a role in the}} homogeneity and performance of the coating. I explored two deposition techniques, with dip coating proving more effective than spray coating. After NPs deposition, few thermal treatments were required. I assessed the influence of treatment temperature (T) on the coating, especially for a sensitive material like copper. The crucial step of the process was the immersion in boiling water to form a flower-like boehmite nanostructure. After grafting FAS chains, the surface became superhydrophobic. I characterized the coating in terms of wetting properties (static contact angle CA and contact angle hysteresis CAH) with water and other liquids and it proved superhydrophobic and highly oleophobic. I also assessed coating durability by performing ageing tests in chemically and mechanically aggressive conditions. The coating displayed remarkable resistance, still delivering excellent liquid repellence after the tests. Furthermore, I determined surface morphology with FESEM observations throughout the process, while colleagues at Università La Sapienza investigated the surface chemical composition with XPS analysis and DFT calculations. FAS molecules formed an ordered and stable monolayer on the boehmite coating. Further characterizations concerned coating adhesion to different substrates and roughness. As SHSs have a wide range of potential applications, it is useful to assess their behavior in “dynamic” conditions. For example, the study of single drop impacts is crucial in applications like sprays or ink-jet printers. Thus, I observed the impact of water and hexadecane drops on SHSs with different morphology and chemical composition. Surprisingly, it was not possible to easily correlate wetting properties and drop impact outcome, as surfaces with the same CAs provided different drop impact results. Parameters related to the liquid (velocity, surface tension, viscosity) and to the surface (morphology, roughness and, unexpectedly, chemical composition) played relevant roles in determining impact outcomes. I also studied the drop shedding behavior on the SHSs at different T and relative humidity (RH) conditions. At room T and low RH, a sessile drop could be easily shed by a low-speed airflow. On the other hand, high RH and T < 0 °C strongly hindered shedding, thus requiring much higher airflow speed U to occur. Furthermore, surface roughness proved influent in determining critical U. I also tried to quantify the delay in drop freezing provided by the superhydrophobic coating, but instrumental issues made it difficult to obtain reliable data. Moreover, I measured the evolution of CAH when the surface was kept in high RH environment. An interesting drop in CAH after long condensation times was observed, but further investigations are needed. Finally, I evaluated the <b>anti-friction</b> <b>properties</b> of the coating deposited on pump components. The coating provided a remarkable and long-lasting friction reduction, with positive effects on pump efficiency. In summary, the hybrid, nanostructured coating owned remarkable liquid-repellent properties, due to the combination of flower-like morphology and grafted FAS molecules. The coating displayed excellent durability in a wide spectrum of aggressive environments and proved efficient even in dynamic conditions (e. g. drop impact, drop shedding with airflow). However, limitations appeared in severe conditions like high pH, high RH and freezing T. Future work must be devoted to the optimization of the coating to widen its range of potential applications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Evidence has {{strongly}} {{indicated that}} surface-active phospholipid (SAPL), or surfactant, lines {{the surface of}} cartilage {{and serves as a}} lubricating agent. Previous clinical study showed that a saturated phosphatidylcholine (SPC), dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), was effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis, however recent studies suggested that the dominant SAPL species at some sites outside the lung are not SPC, rather, are unsaturated phosphatidylcholine (USPC). Some of these USPC have been proven to be good boundary lubricants by our previous study, implicating their possible important physiological roles in joint if their existence can be confirmed. So far, no study has been conducted to identify the whole molecule species of different phosphatidylcholine (PC) classes on the surface of cartilage. In this study we identified the dominant PC molecule species on the surface of cartilage. We also confirmed that some of these PC species possess a property of semipermeability. Methods HPLC was used to analyse the PC profile of bovine cartilage samples and comparisons of DPPC and USPC were carried out through semipermeability tests. Results It was confirmed that USPC are the dominant SAPL species on the surface of cartilage. In particular, they are Dilinoleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC), Palmitoyl-linoleoyl-phosphatidylcholine, (PLPC), Palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and Stearoyl-linoleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (SLPC). The relative content of DPPC (a SPC) was only 8 %. Two USPC, PLPC and POPC, were capable of generating osmotic pressure that is equivalent to that by DPPC. Conclusion The results from the current study confirm vigorously that USPC is the endogenous species inside the joint as against DPPC thereby confirming once again that USPC, and not SPC, characterizes the PC species distribution at non-lung sites of the body. USPC not only has better <b>anti-friction</b> and lubrication <b>properties</b> than DPPC, they also possess a level of semipermeability that is equivalent to DPPC. We therefore hypothesize that USPC can constitute a possible addition or alternative to the current commercially available viscosupplementation products for the prevention and treatment of osteoarthritis in the future. </p...|$|R
40|$|With vast {{application}} of nickel-based super alloys in strategic fields, {{it has become}} increasingly necessary to evaluate the performance of advanced cutting tools for machining such alloys. In order to have elementary knowledge on machinability characteris tics of Incoloy 825 which was so far unknown, in the initial stage of experiment, tool wear and its mechanism, chip characteristics and surface integrity during dry machining were first studied using uncoated and chemical vapour deposition (CVD) multilayer TiN/TiCN/Al 2 O 3 /ZrCN coated tool with different cutting speeds. The coated tool could not improve surface finish, but outperformed its uncoated counterpart in terms of other aspects. In the second stage of the study, the primary objective was to recommend suitable cutting tool for machining Incoloy 825. Detailed study was undertaken using commercially available uncoated, CVD and physical vapour deposition (PVD) coated carbide tools, the performance of which was comparatively evaluated in terms of surface roughness, cutting temperature, cutting force, coefficient of friction, tool wear and its mechanism during dry machining. Effect of cutting speed (VC) and feed (f) was also studied. Although, CVD coated tool was not useful in decreasing surface roughness and temperature compared to uncoated one, significant decrease in cutting force and tool wear could be achieved with the same coated tool even under high cutting parameters (Vc= 124 m/min and f= 0. 2 mm/rev). On the other hand, PVD coated tool consisting of alternate layers of TiAlN/TiN outperformed the other tools in terms of all machinability characteristics that have been studied. This might be attributed to excellent <b>anti-friction</b> and anti-sticking <b>property</b> of TiN and good toughness which is a salient feature of PVD technique as well as multilayer configuration, in combination with thermally resistant TiAlN phase. In the final stage of the research work, the feasibility of best performing PVD coated tool was evaluated under environment-friendly dry machining condition in comparison with uncoated tool under conventional flood cooling and minimum quantity lubrication (MQL). Although temperature obtained with PVD coated tool under dry machining has always been significantly more than wet environment, the same coated tool remarkably brought down cutting force, surface roughness and tool wear under dry environment. The results achieved under both rough and finish modes of machining clearly established the use of PVD coated tool under dry environment as a sustainable strategy for achieving green machining of nickel-based super alloys...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} funded under the Department of Energy (DOE) Lab Call on Nanomanufacturing for Energy Efficiency and was {{directed}} toward the development of novel boron-based nanocolloidal lubrication additives for improving the friction and wear performance of machine components {{in a wide range}} of industrial and transportation applications. Argonne�s research team concentrated on the scientific and technical aspects of the project, using a range of state-of-the art analytical and tribological test facilities. Argonne has extensive past experience and expertise in working with boron-based solid and liquid lubrication additives, and has intellectual property ownership of several. There were two industrial collaborators in this project: Ashland Oil (represented by its Valvoline subsidiary) and Primet Precision Materials, Inc. (a leading nanomaterials company). There was also a sub-contract with the University of Arkansas. The major objectives of the project were to develop novel boron-based nanocolloidal lubrication additives and to optimize and verify their performance under boundary-lubricated sliding conditions. The project also tackled problems related to colloidal dispersion, larger-scale manufacturing and blending of nano-additives with base carrier oils. Other important issues dealt with in the project were determination of the optimum size and concentration of the particles and compatibility with various base fluids and/or additives. Boron-based particulate additives considered in this project included boric acid (H{sub 3 }BO{sub 3 }), hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), boron oxide, and borax. As part of this project, we also explored a hybrid MoS{sub 2 } + boric acid formulation approach for more effective lubrication and reported the results. The major motivation behind this work was to reduce energy losses related to friction and wear in a wide spectrum of mechanical systems and thereby reduce our dependence on imported oil. Growing concern over greenhouse gas emissions was also a major reason. The transportation sector alone consumes about 13 million barrels of crude oil per day (nearly 60 % of which is imported) and is responsible for about 30 % of the CO{sub 2 } emission. When we consider manufacturing and other energy-intensive industrial processes, the amount of petroleum being consumed due to friction and wear reaches more than 20 million barrels per day (from official energy statistics, U. S. Energy Information Administration). Frequent remanufacturing and/or replacement of worn parts due to friction-, wear-, and scuffing-related degradations also consume significant amounts of energy and give rise to additional CO{sub 2 } emission. Overall, the total annual cost of friction- and wear-related energy and material losses is estimated to be rather significant (i. e., as much as 5 % of the gross national products of highly industrialized nations). It is projected that more than half of the total friction- and wear-related energy losses can be recovered by developing and implementing advanced friction and wear control technologies. In transportation vehicles alone, 10 % to 15 % of the fuel energy is spent to overcome friction. If we can cut down the friction- and wear-related energy losses by half, then we can potentially save up to 1. 5 million barrels of petroleum per day. Also, less friction and wear would mean less energy consumption as well as less carbon emissions and hazardous byproducts being generated and released to the environment. New and more robust anti-friction and -wear control technologies may thus have a significant positive impact on improving the efficiency and environmental cleanliness of the current legacy fleet and future transportation systems. Effective control of friction in other industrial sectors such as manufacturing, power generation, mining and oil exploration, and agricultural and earthmoving machinery may bring more energy savings. Therefore, this project was timely and responsive to the energy and environmental objectives of DOE and our nation. In this project, most of the boron-based materials with known and potential <b>anti-friction</b> and -wear <b>properties</b> have been manufactured as colloidal additives and tested for their effectiveness in controlling friction and wear. Unlike other anti-friction and -wear additives, which consist of zinc, molybdenum, sulfur, phosphorus, and even chlorine, lubricious boron compounds considered in this project are made of boron, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen, which are more environmentally benign. Among others, boric acid is a natural mineral (known in mineralogy as �sassolite�). Based on our earlier exploratory research, it was found to offer the best overall prospect in terms of performance improvements, environmental friendliness, and ease of manufacturing and, hence, cost effectiveness. Hexagonal boron nitride and borax also offered good prospects for improving the tribological properties of lubricated sliding surfaces. Boron oxide particles were found to be rather hard and somewhat abrasive and, hence, were not considered beyond the initial screening studies. In our bench-top tribological evaluation, we also demonstrated that those additives which worked well with engine oils could work equally well with very common gear oils. When added at appropriate concentrations, such gear oils were found to provide significant resistance to micropitting and scuffing failures in bench-top tribological test systems. Their traction coefficients were also reduced substantially and their scuffing limits were improved considerably. Such impressive tribological behavior of boron-based additives may have been due to their high chemical affinities to interact with sliding contact surfaces and to form slick and protective boundary films. Indeed, our surface studies have confirmed that most of the boron-based nanoparticulate additives prepared in our project possess a strong tendency to form a boron-rich boundary film on sliding contact surfaces. It is believed that the formation of such slick and highly durable boundary films is perhaps one of the fundamental reasons for their superior anti-friction, -wear, and -scuffing performance. Boron-based additives developed under this project have shown potential to reduce or replace the uses of environmentally unsafe sulfur- and phosphorus-bearing anti-wear and �friction additives, such as zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate (ZDDP) and molybdenum dialkyl dithiocarbamate (MoDTC), in current lubricating oils. Because ZDDP and MoDTC were suspected of adversely impacting the performance of after-treatment catalysts in current engines, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other regulatory agencies are demanding that the concentrations of these catalysts in current oils be curtailed drastically. The boron-based nano-additives developed in this project may help reduce the use of ZDDP and MoDTC additives and, hence, help ease the poisoning effects on after-treatment catalysts. When used as lubricity additives, these boron additives can chemically interact with sliding or contacting surfaces and form a protective and slick boundary film, which can, in turn, help reduce friction and wear and increase resistance to scuffing. In the cases of traditional anti-friction and -wear additives mentioned, such protective boundary films result from phosphorus, sulfur, and other elements in the additive package, and again they have been under increased scrutiny in recent years, mainly because of their adverse effects on after-treatment devices. Overall, the boron-based nano-additive technology of this project was shown to hold promise for a broad range of industrial and transportation applications where lower friction and higher resistance to wear and scuffing are needed. Due to more stringent operating conditions of modern machinery, rolling, rotating, and sliding components have been failing to meet the projected lifetimes, mainly because of failures related to mechanical wear, corrosion, and scuffing. The novel boron-based additive technology developed under this project may help such machine components to function reliably by cutting down the friction and wear losses and by increasing resistance to scuffing...|$|R
