5|$|The Australians {{proceeded}} to play Yorkshire at Bradford, on <b>a</b> <b>damp</b> pitch suitable for slower bowling. In the first innings, Brown took three catches from the bowling of Keith Millerwho had resorted to bowling off spinas Yorkshire were bowled out for 71 in difficult batting conditions. Opening with Morris while Barnes was rested, Brown made 13 as the match remained finely balanced after Australia was bowled out for 101. Brown took another catch from Miller {{in the second}} innings as the hosts were bowled out for 89. Chasing 60 for victory, Brown fell to Frank Smailes for two as the Australian top order collapsed to 6/31effectively seven wickets down with the injured Sam Loxton unable to batbefore scraping home by four wickets.|$|E

Bradman rested himself and returned to London, so his deputy Lindsay Hassett led the team. Yorkshire were bowled out in difficult batting conditions for 71, before Australia replied with 101. The hosts were then bowled out for 89. Chasing 60 for victory, the Australian top order collapsed to 6/31. Neil Harvey and Don Tallon survived a dropped catch and a stumping opportunity, before seeing Australia home by four wickets. It was the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour.|$|E
5|$|The {{first case}} against Acton, before Mr. Baron Carter, {{was for the}} murder in 1726 of Thomas Bliss, a {{carpenter}} and debtor. Unable to pay the prison fees, Bliss had been left with so little to eat that {{he had tried to}} escape by throwing a rope over the wall, but his pursuers severed it and he fell 20feet into the prison yard. Wanting to know who had supplied the rope, Acton beat him with a bull's pizzle, stamped on his stomach, placed him in the hole (<b>a</b> <b>damp</b> space under the stairs), then in the strong room.|$|E
5|$|After {{the very}} warm {{practice}} sessions, qualifying on Saturday was run under difficult weather conditions. Qualifying one (Q1) started on <b>a</b> <b>damp</b> track and therefore on intermediate tyres, while by Q2 the track was almost dry and slick tyres were used. In Q1 Romain Grosjean {{collided with the}} slower running HRT of Pedro de la Rosa and lost his front wing. While he succeeded in nursing the car back into the pit lane, {{he was unable to}} change his tyres and was therefore left in a disappointing 18th position on the grid. Michael Schumacher's last ever qualifying did not go well either. He took 14th position, almost half a second down on his teammate, admitting he had perhaps compromised his setup too much for an expected wet race. The McLarens were fastest all weekend and easily took the front row, with Lewis Hamilton securing his last pole position with the team. Title contenders Vettel and Alonso both struggled, taking 4th and 8th position on the grid respectively. Pastor Maldonado was handed a 10-place grid penalty for missing the weighbridge {{in the second part of}} qualifying. He dropped from sixth to 16th, moving Alonso one place up to seventh.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{returned}} {{for the following}} match, which was against Nottinghamshire, and added 122 to register his fourth century {{in less than three}} weeks. Australia made 400 but the hosts hung on for a draw in the second innings. In the next match against Hampshire, Brown opened with Barnes and made a duck as Australia were dismissed for 117 on <b>a</b> <b>damp</b> pitch in reply to the home side's 195. It {{was the first time the}} tourists had conceded a first innings during the summer. Hampshire were subsequently bowled out in their second innings for 103 to leave Australia a target of 182. This time Barnes fell for a duck, and Brown anchored Australia to an eight-wicket win with an unbeaten 81 after a century second-wicket partnership with Ian Johnson. The final match before the First Test was against Sussex. Opening with Morris, Brown played second fiddle, accumulating 44 as the pair put on an opening stand of 153. Morris went on to 184 and Australia declared at 5/549 before completing another innings victory.|$|E
5|$|McCool was rested for {{the second}} tour match against Leicestershire, which Australia won by an innings. The next match against Yorkshireon <b>a</b> <b>damp</b> pitch {{favourable}} to slower bowlingwas the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour. McCool made three in the first innings as Australia replied to Yorkshire's 71 with 101. After the hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 5/20 in pursuit of 60 for victory when McCool arrived at the crease. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia effectively only had four wickets in hand and faced the prospect of losing to an English county {{for the first time}} since 1912. McCool scored five before hitting a long hop back to left-arm spinner Johnny Wardle to leave Australia at 6/31. However, Australia lost no further batsmen and scraped home by four wickets. McCool’s leg spin was used as Keith Miller and Bill Johnston bowled almost unchanged for the entire match.|$|E
5|$|Montoya {{took the}} fastest lap {{of the third}} {{practice}} session, a 1:25.558 which was held on <b>a</b> <b>damp</b> track. Barrichello was second fastest with a time 0.336 slower than Montoya. de la Rosa was running quickly and set the third fastest lap, a 1:26.542. BAR drivers Villeneuve and Panis set {{the fourth and fifth}} fastest times. Räikkönen, Eddie Irvine, Verstappen, Enrique Bernoldi and Heidfeld rounded out the top ten. Giancarlo Fisichella, Yoong, Jenson Button, Jean Alesi, Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Häkkinen and Fernando Alonso did not set lap times during the session. The circuit dried up for the final practice session where Michael Schumacher had the fastest lap of the weekend so far with a 1:23.178; Barrichello had the fastest time when circuit conditions improved but fell to fourth. The two Ferrari drivers were separated by Montoya and Trulli. Coulthard was fifth quickest with Ralf Schumacher sixth. Heidfeld, Häkkinen, de la Rosa and Räikkönen rounded out the top ten drivers ahead of qualifying. Enge spun but regained control of his car.|$|E

5|$|Morris was rested for the {{following}} match against Leicestershire, so Barnes partnered Brown {{at the top of}} the order. The pair put on 46 before Brown fell. Barnes then put on 111 with Bradman for the second wicket before falling for 78 at 2/157 to a leg before wicket (lbw) decision the tourists regarded as a clear error. Unhindered, Australia made 448 and won by an innings. Barnes took two catches in the first innings, both from spinners, and bowled four overs without success in the second innings. The Australians proceeded to play Yorkshire at Bradford, on <b>a</b> <b>damp</b> pitch favourable to slower bowling. Bradman rested himself and Barnes as Australia came closest to losing a match for the whole tour. The tourists were 6/31 in pursuit of 60 for victory—effectively seven wickets down with one injured player—before scraping home to win by four wickets.|$|E
5|$|Tallon {{played a}} key role in Australia's victory in the next match against Yorkshire, on <b>a</b> <b>damp</b> pitch that suited slower bowling. He came in at 7/86 and made ten in the first innings to push Australia to 101 in reply to Yorkshire's 71, in which Tallon did not concede a bye. However, Tallon was not so tidy in the second innings, conceding 11 byes as the hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings. He did not make a {{dismissal}} in the match. Australia then collapsed to 6/31 in pursuit of 60 for victory when Tallon strode in. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia only had three wickets in hand. Australia faced its first loss to an English county since 1912. He survived an immediate leg before wicket appeal and then hit a shot that fell just short of a fielder. He then compiled 17 unbeaten runs as Australia scraped home by four wickets.|$|E
5|$|The Australians then {{proceeded}} to play Yorkshire, on <b>a</b> <b>damp</b> pitch that suited slower bowling. Loxton bowled only one over, which was a maiden, before pulling his groin while trying to attain more pace, as the hosts were bowled out for 71. He was unable to bat or bowl again in the game as Australia replied with 101 and then removed the hosts for 89 to leave themselves a target of 60 for victory. Australia came closest to losing for the whole tour. They fell to 6/31, effectively seven down with Loxton unable to bat, before scraping home without further loss, although both batsmen at the crease survived chances. Due to his injury, Loxton was rested {{for the next two}} matches against Surrey at The Oval in London and Cambridge University. Australia won both matches by an innings.|$|E

5|$|As {{everything}} {{depended on}} the final game, the Imperial Cricket Conference agreed that the match be played to a finish. Carr was replaced as captain by Percy Chapman, a decision which proved controversial in the press; Rhodes was also recalled to the team, aged 48. Amid huge public interest, the match was evenly balanced {{at the end of}} the second day when England began their second innings. Overnight rain seriously damaged the pitch before the third morning and few critics—including members of the home team—expected England to score many runs. But Hobbs and Sutcliffe, who had scored 49 on the second evening, began to bat confidently before the effects of a hot sun drying <b>a</b> <b>damp</b> pitch made batting even more hazardous. Concentrating on defence, but scoring whenever possible, the pair added 172 in total. Immediately after reaching 100, Hobbs was out and received a prolonged ovation from the crowd. Many critics believed that, given the conditions, match situation and pressure, this was his greatest innings. England built up a large lead and bowled Australia out to win the Ashes. Late in the season, Hobbs made the highest score of his career, 316 not out for Surrey against Middlesex at Lord's, establishing a record individual innings for Lord's which survived until 1990. In total, Hobbs scored 2,949 runs at 77.60, including 12 centuries, to be placed first in the national batting averages.|$|E
5|$|At first, Harvey {{struggled}} in the English conditions, failing to pass 25 {{in his first}} six innings. His most notable contribution {{in the early stages}} of the campaign was against Yorkshire in Bradford, on <b>a</b> <b>damp</b> pitch that suited slower bowling. The match saw 324 runs fall for 36 wickets. No sooner had Harvey walked out to bat, stand-in captain Lindsay Hassett was caught to leave Australia at 5/20 in pursuit of 60. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia were effectively six wickets down and faced its first loss to an English county since 1912. Harvey had scored a solitary run when he hit a ball to Len Hutton at short leg, who dived forwards and grabbed it with both hands before dropping it. Harvey then swept the next ball for a boundary. Colin McCool was out at 6/31 before Harvey and wicket-keeper Don Tallon steadied Australia. Harvey was reprieved on 12; he charged the bowling but the wicketkeeper fumbled the stumping opportunity. Harvey then hit the winning runs with a six over the sightscreen, ending unbeaten on 18 not out. It was the closest Australia had come to defeat for the whole tour.|$|E
5|$|Bradman rested Lindwall for {{the second}} tour match against Leicestershire, which ended in an innings victory for the Australians. Lindwall {{returned}} for the next fixture against Yorkshire at Bradford, but bowled only nine overs {{for a total of}} 1/16. He made a duck in the first innings on <b>a</b> <b>damp</b> pitch favourable to slower bowling, as Australia scraped home by four wickets. Lindwall was due in next when Australia collapsed to 6/31 in pursuit of 60 for victory in the second innings. The tourists were effectively seven wickets down with the injured Sam Loxton unable to bat, but Neil Harvey and Don Tallon saw Australia to the target without further loss. It was the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour. The Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval. They batted first and Lindwall managed only four, clean bowled by Alec Bedser, as Australia amassed 632. He then took the first two wickets to reduce Surrey to 2/15 in the first innings. Bradman used Lindwall sparingly, taking a match total of 3/45 from 25 overs as Surrey were defeated by an innings. Fingleton felt that Lindwall was at his fastest for the season during the Surrey match. One of Lindwall's bouncers flew over three feet above the batsman's head.|$|E
