Particular attention is given in elucidating the roles of various micro-structural defects such as de-bonded fiber/matrix interfaces, cracks and voids on thermal conductivity in these materials. In addition, {{the effect of the}} fiber precursor material is explored by analyzing PAN-based and pitch-based carbon fibers, both in the same type pitch-based carbon matrix. The finite element analysis is carried out at two distinct length scales: (a) a micro scale comparable with the diameter of carbon fibers and (b) a macro scale comparable with the thickness of carbon– carbon composite structures used in the thermal protection systems for space vehicles. The results obtain at room temperature are quite consistent with their experimental counterparts.

40|$|Objectives: The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to assess personality traits and levels of anxiety in Foundation Year 2 (F 2) doctors during the foundation doctor training programme in the Northern Ireland Deanery (NIMDTA). Methods: A prospective survey-based study was conducted for all F 2 doctors attending the mandatory generic skills programme at NIMDTA. Anxiety was measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) while personality was assessed using the IPIP-NEO questionnaire. These previously validated questionnaires were completed at the start and again {{at the end of the}} F 2 year. Results: 147 (M= 65, F= 82) and 106 (M= 55, F= 51) F 2 doctors completed questionnaires at both time points. STAI scores suggested a moderate level of anxiety amongst both male and female doctors at baseline and at the end of the academic year. There was no difference between gender for either parameter (Baseline-State: 34. 0 vs. 36. 0, p= 0. 48 and Trait: 39. 0 vs. 40. 5, p= 0. 33) (End-State: 41. 0 vs. 36. 0, p= 0. 14 and Trait: 42. 0 vs. 40. 5, p= 0. 78).

40|$|The high-enthalpy flow {{generated}} by hypersonic vehicles traveling within the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s atmosphere inherently delivers an elevated heat flux {{to the vehicle}} surface. In addition to conductive heating, the liberated energy {{generated by}} various exothermic chemical reactions occurring at the vehicle surface further augment the total heat load. Quantifying the rates at which these reactions take place is imperative and remains a significant challenge as developers attempt to design {{the next generation of}} thermal protection systems. This study focused on nitrogen recombination and carbon nitridation, as these reactions are ubiquitous to the most aggressive atmospheric re-entry trajectories in which carbon-based ablative heat shields are conventionally employed. The 30 -kW inductively coupled plasma torch located within the Plasma Diagnostics and Test Laboratory at the University of Vermont was used to produce high-enthalpy nitrogen plasma flow, which sufficiently simulated the various in-flight heat flux processes. A combination of optical-based techniques, including spontaneous emission spectroscopy and laser induced fluorescence were utilized to study the free jet and the interaction of the flow with samples constructed from POCO graphite. Emission measurements within the free stream indicated that the nitrogen flow was in non-equilibrium due to the inverse predissociation of ground state nitrogen atoms into the v = 13 vibrational level of the molecular nitrogen electronic B-state. The degree of non-equilibrium was quantified by determining the overpopulation of ground state nitrogen with respect to equilibrium and its effects were considered throughout the analysis. Results obtained through emission spectroscopy and laser induced fluorescence confirmed that the graphite material behaved as a catalytic surface that actively promoted nitrogen recombination. Additionally, the calculated carbon nitridation rate was several orders less efficient, although its effect on the sample surface erosion was evident in the sample mass loss measurements. Subsequently, an independent set of heat flux measurements performed over materials of varying catalycities further supported the data obtained with optical diagnostics. Furthermore, the heat flux results yielded the surface <b>accommodation</b> <b>factor</b> of graphite for the nitrogen recombination rate and indicated that the surface was slightly less than fully-accommodating...|$|E

Reasonable accommodations (RA) have been associated with overall job satisfaction, enhanced job tenure, and, increased job performance for employees with disabilities. However, reasonable accommodation stakeholders still struggle with how best to effectively meet the needs of employees with disabilities in order to maximize their employability. Few studies have specifically examined the criteria that employers use to determine responses to reasonable accommodation requests by employees with disabilities. A sample of U. S. employers was asked to respond to a reasonable accommodation scenario, and rate the influences of a priori identified items on their response to the <b>accommodation</b> request. Exploratory <b>factor</b> analytic procedures and regression analyses are used to identify the factors correlated with employers' likelihood of approving or denying reasonable <b>accommodation</b> requests. Three <b>factors</b> were identified to underlie the criteria for employers' accommodation decisions - employer logistics and obligations in providing accommodations, relationships between employer and employee, and accommodation costs and resource.

Our understanding of the rationale by which employers respond to reasonable accommodation requests is essential to seeking solutions for hiring and retaining persons with disabilities.

We present structures of the mammalian ribosome engaged with decoding factor⋅GTPase complexes representing intermediates of translation elongation (aminoacyl-tRNA⋅eEF 1 A), termination (eRF 1 ⋅eRF 3), and ribosome rescue (Pelota⋅Hbs 1 l). Comparative analyses reveal that each decoding factor exploits the plasticity of the ribosomal decoding center to differentially remodel ribosomal proteins and rRNA. This leads to varying degrees of large-scale ribosome movements and implies distinct mechanisms for communicating information from the decoding center to each GTPase.  Additional structural snapshots of the translation termination pathway reveal the conformational changes that choreograph the <b>accommodation</b> of decoding <b>factors</b> into the peptidyl transferase center.

In that symposium, small groups of participants were invited to discuss theoretical, methodological, and implementation considerations for studying workplace function and well-being among workers with chronic health conditions. As a follow-up to the symposium, the organizers invited authors to submit original articles to a Special Section of the Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation for peer review and publication. Results Results of the symposium reflected the need to address social, not just physical, aspects of the workplace, to include both individual-level and organizational interventions, and to integrate employer perspectives and operational models.

AIM: To determine the relative contribution {{of each of}} these factors to overall dyspeptic symptom severity and weight loss in FD. METHODS: In 201 consecutive tertiary care patients with FD (mean age 40. 1 (SD 12. 6) years), gastric sensorimotor function was studied using barostat (sensitivity, compliance and <b>accommodation).</b> Psychosocial <b>factors</b> (depression and anxiety disorders, positive and negative affect, perceived stress, alexithymia and history of abuse), somatisation and co-morbid irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic fatigue symptoms were assessed using self-report questionnaires. Variables were correlated with dyspepsia symptom severity (DSS) and weight loss. Hierarchical multiple linear regression was used to identify determinants of DSS and weight loss. RESULTS: Multiple linear regression identified the following determinants of DSS: gastric sensitivity (beta = 0. 77, p = 0. 25), depression (beta = 0. 12, p = 0. 06) and somatisation (beta = 0. 48, p< 0. 0001) (controlling for age and occupation, R(2) = 0. 29, p< 0. 0001). The effect of depression on DSS is partially mediated by somatisation. Gastric sensitivity (beta = 2. 87, p = 0. 08), history of childhood sexual abuse (beta = 9. 37, p = 0. 0006), depression (beta = 0. 19, p = 0. 24) and somatisation (beta = 0. 67, p = 0. 01) are independent determinants of weight loss (controlling for gender and occupation, R(2) = 0. 42, p< 0. 0001). The effect of depression on weight loss is fully mediated by somatisation. CONCLUSION: Symptom severity and weight loss in FD are determined by psychosocial factors (depression, abuse history) and somatisation, and only to a lesser extent by gastric sensorimotor function. The importance of psychosocial factors and somatisation compared to gastric sensorimotor function is most pronounced in hypersensitive patients. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Stratal slicing {{assumes that}} the {{vertically}} equal ratio division between two time-equivalent sedimentary interfaces is approximate to slicing along time-equivalent sedimentary interfaces. This assumption {{assumes that the}} deposition velocity in the vertical direction does not change with time. However, deposition velocity is affected by factors such as sediment supply rate and changes in <b>accommodation,</b> and these <b>factors</b> change with time due {{to the effects of}} tectonic movements and paleoclimate, among other variables. Thus, any geological process is a multivariate function including the time variable. For any point on a plane, the structure and sedimentary environment constantly change with time; thus, the deposition velocity at this point changes with time. Moreover, in many cases, the effects of this change on deposits in continental basins are not negligible (Lin and Zhang 2006), which is different from deposits in marine basins. In addition, the virtual 3 D model built by Zeng et al. (1998 a, b) reveals that in the 30  Hz Ricker wavelet synthetic data, the stratal slices controlled by two marker events have a left or right deviation of approximately 9  ms. Thus, diachroneity is likely to occur in stratal slices of thin continental interbeds.|$|R

For very short pulses, increasing temperature has two effects.

(2) For higher temperatures, effect (1) saturates, but the decreasing relaxation times of Na inactivation (h) and K activation (n) <b>factor</b> <b>accommodation</b> and increased threshold. The result is a U-shaped threshold temperature curve. R. Guttman has obtained such U-shaped curves for 50 µsec pulses. Assuming higher ionic conductances decreases the electrical relaxation time and shifts the curve to the right along the temperature axis. Making the conductances increase with temperature flattens the curve. Using very long pulses favors effect (2) over (1) and makes threshold increase monotonically with temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to elucidate the factors influencing treatment compliance of asthmatic patients and to introduce the measures which will facilitate rise of the compliance indices. Materials and methods. There were examined 104 patients from 18 - 50 years old. For the study management there were formed two groups with main one comprising 51 patients undergoing combined basic medication and allergen specific immunotherapy. The second, control group, included 53 patients who refused to undergo allergen specific immunotherapy and they received only basic medication-assisted treatment. The follow-up of the patients was conducted during a year. To determinate treatment compliance there was used own questionnaire and the control of treatment efficacy was done on the grounds of Asthma Control Test and Patient Quality of Life Questionnaire. Findings of the study and their discussion. At the beginning of the study the medium index of the patients’ treatment compliance was low in both groups. During each doctor’s visiting there were checked and worked out patients’ practical skills on accurate drug administration and control over treatment handling as well as conducting of monitoring and modification of triggers (the need in smoking cessation, active motion and bodily exercises performance, hypoallergic diet abiding, etc. was explained) and comorbidity treatment. Within three months the indices increased in both groups and some increase remained six and even twelve months after. Improvement in patients’ indices of treatment compliance was accompanied by the better performance of treatment control and quality of life. During the study the majority of patients of the main group managed to reduce a daily dose of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting b 2 -agonists. Conclusion. The conducted study shows that after 12 months the indices of patients’ treatment compliance, ability to control asthma and quality of life increased in both groups while the triggers were decreased (by means of smoking cessation, comorbidity management and <b>accommodation</b> ecological <b>factors</b> control). At the same time, better results (bronchial asthma manageability, basic treatment volume decrease) were received in the group of patients with allergen-specific immunotherapy treatment application...|$|R
