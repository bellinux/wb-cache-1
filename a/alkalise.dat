The SEM micrographs of untreated jute fibres show a smooth surface, while <b>alkalised</b> jute fibres show rough and void regions between individual fibre cells.

40|$|In {{this study}} a {{thorough}} analysis {{of physical and}} fine structure of hemp fibre bundles, namely surface topography, diameter, cellulose content and crystallinity index, have been presented. The fibre bundles have been <b>alkalised</b> and physical and mechanical properties analysed. Alkalisation was found to change the surface topography of fibre bundles and the diameter decreased with increased concentration of caustic soda. Cellulose content increase slightly at lower NaCH concentrations and decrease at higher NaOH concentrations. The crystallinity index decrease with increase in caustic soda concentration up to 0. 24 % NaOH beyond which, it decreases with increase in NaOH concentration. It was {{also found that the}} tensile strength and stiffness increases with increase in the concentration of NaOH up to a limit. Tensile strength and Young's modulus increase with decrease in cellulose content, while crystalline cellulose decreases slightly but with improved crystalline packing order resulting in increased mechanical properties. Similar observations are elucidated by the crystallinity index. <b>Alkalised</b> hemp fibre bundles were found to exhibit a similar specific stiffness to steel, E-glass and Kevlar 29 fibres. The results also show that crystallinity index obtained following alkalisation has a reverse correlation to the mechanical properties. Stiffer <b>alkalised</b> hemp fibre bundles are suitable candidates as reinforcements to replace synthetic fibres. The improvement in mechanical properties of alkali treated hemp fibre bundles confirms their use as reinforcement materials. (c) 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Background—Recent studies {{indicate}} that faecal pH is acidified in patients with inflammatory bowel disease compared with healthy controls. In healthy volunteers, stool pH, faecal flora, and bile acid concentration could be affected by means of elemental diets.  Aims—To assess the role of variations of faecal pH on leucocyte endothelial cell adhesion in indomethacin induced long lasting ileitis in rats.  Methods—Indomethacin (7. 5 mg/kg subcutaneously) was injected twice, 24 hours apart. Rats were either fed with the identical diet before and 10 days after the induction of inflammation until the experiment, or the diet was changed {{at the time of}} induction. Ten postcapillary mesenteric venules (30 µm diameter) per animal were observed using intravital microscopy. Macroscopic visible intestinal ulceration was scored and faecal pH of different sections of the small bowel was determined.  Results—Small intestinal faecal pH was 8. 5 in controls and 8. 0 in indomethacin treated animals. Indomethacin significantly changed microcirculatory parameters: there was a 2. 3 -fold increase in leucocyte adherence, a 3. 2 -fold increase in leucocyte emigration, and a 20 % reduction in shear rate. Application of various diets or diet combinations resulted in variations in faecal pH ranging from 7. 8 to 8. 8 which were inversely correlated with macroscopic ulcerations (r=− 0. 67). Leucocyte adherence was attenuated with increased pH and augmented with decreased pH (r=− 0. 55). Venular wall shear rate was positively correlated with faecal pH (r= 0. 48) while leucocyte emigration showed no correlation. Leucocyte rolling velocity was not significantly altered. Normalisation of faecal pH by different <b>alkalising</b> drugs induced a significant decrease in leucocyte adherence in standard fed, indomethacin treated rats.  Conclusions—Faecal pH is lowered in the indomethacin model of long lasting ileitis in rats, which is similar to human inflammatory bowel disease. Alkalisation of faecal pH due to different diets or <b>alkalising</b> drugs reduces indomethacin induced leucocyte endothelial cell adhesion and macroscopic intestinal damage. These results may provide a rationale for the therapeutic effect of enteral diets in Crohn's disease. ...|$|R
40|$|Increases in {{dissolved}} {{organic carbon}} (DOC) fluxes may relate to changes in sulphur and nitrogen pollution. We integrated existing models of vegetation growth and soil organic matter turnover, acid-base dynamics, and organic matter mobility, to form the ‘MADOC’ model. After calibrating parameters governing interactions between pH and DOC dissolution using control treatments on two field experiments, MADOC reproduced responses of pH and DOC to additions of acidifying and <b>alkalising</b> solutions. Long-term trends {{in a range of}} acid waters were also reproduced. The model suggests that the sustained nature of observed DOC increases can best be explained by a continuously replenishing potentially-dissolved carbon pool, rather than dissolution of a large accumulated store.

40|$|Natural fibres have {{recently}} become an attractive alternative to synthetic fibres {{in the implementation}} in polymer composite structures. This is due to contemporary environmental concerns such as climate change which have caused engineers to consider renewable resources in composite structures. Inherent flaws within natural fibres {{in terms of their}} constituent contents (hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin) reduce the compatibility of these fibres with polymer matrices. Fibre surface modifications using chemical treatments have the potential to improve fibre-matrix compatibility. In this study, the effects of chemical treatments on hemp fibres and the resulted polyester matrix composite are discussed. The fibres were treated with alkali (0 - 10 % NaOH), acetyl and silane chemicals. The structural composition and thermal decomposition of the fibres after treatments were investigated through chemical analysis, fibre morphology analysis, FTIR analysis, and TGA and DSC analyses. Fibre structure and morphology analysis showed that the amount of hemicellulose and lignin constituents decreased in the case of <b>alkalised</b> and acetylated fibres. Conversely, silane molecules formed couplings on fibre surfaces and there was no changes observed in terms of hemicellulose and lignin contents. Thermal analysis revealed that, due to the presence of hemicellulose constituents, the untreated fibres had lower thermal stability. The tensile properties of treated hemp fibres were measured through DMA. Treated fibres exhibited lower strengths compared to the untreated fibres due to the removal of hemicellulose and lignin binder from their cellulose surfaces. Long unidirectional fibre composites and sandwich structures were tested using tension, compression, shear, bending and impact tests. In both composite cases, 4 % NaOH treatments reduced interface bonding strength and decreased composite properties compared to untreated samples. At higher concentrations (6 - 10 % NaOH), composite properties increased as a result of greater interface bonding. The opposite results were achieved in the case of <b>alkalised</b> fibres that were further treated with acetyl and silane treatments. Failure analysis of tested composites was undertaken through OM and SEM. Micrographs showed results which were in agreement which the properties achieved. Treated fibres were able to effectively improve the bonding properties of composites, even though the mechanical strength of these fibres could be decreased. Thus, the use of chemical treatments on fibres can be justified as overall composite mechanical properties increased when compared to untreated cases. ...|$|R
40|$|AIM: A dental {{composite}} resin, Ariston pHc, {{has been}} described as having a cariostatic effect by buffering acid saliva and preventing decalcification and infiltration of restorations. The buffering effect has been reported due to the release of OH- originated from the alkaline glass embedded in the resin. The release would occur only in the presence of low salivary pH values. The aim of this in vitro investigation was to evaluate pH variations induced by Ariston pHc and 2 other composite resins (P 60 and Z 100). METHODS: Eighteen samples were prepared for each composite and 5 specimens of each brand were embedded in artificial saliva according to Brugirar and Mazille, at 3 different pH values. A 1 (st) group of 5 specimens of each tested resin was immersed in neutral artificial saliva at pH 7. 7, a 2 (nd) group in acidified artificial saliva at pH 5. 45 and a 3 (rd) group in <b>alkalised</b> saliva at pH 9. 25. Three other samples of each resin were immersed in tubes containing distilled water at pH 7. 23 and served as controls. Twelve tubes were filled only with neutral, <b>alkalised</b> and acidified artificial saliva and distilled water at the above mentioned pH values. Measurements of pH modifications were taken after 1, 3, 9, 14, 31 days. RESULTS. Ariston pHc raised the pH of distilled water up to 9. 59 after 1 day, and to 8. 42 after 31 days. This pH modification shown by Ariston pHc in distilled water, compared to those of the other 2 composites were statistically highly significant, with p< 0. 001, while the pH variations of saliva containing the 3 resins were negligible, except for acidified saliva with Ariston pHc, where a slight pH enhancement with some statistical significance (p= 0. 04) was found. However, acidified saliva without any resin embedded was found to shift to neutrality as well. CONCLUSION: These results strongly suggest that none of the 3 tested materials can achieve an effective buffering action in vitro on low salivary pH values. However, the ability of Ariston pHc to raise the pH in distilled water, and to a lesser degree in acidified saliva, suggests that an in vivo buffering effect cannot be excluded...|$|R

Fibres were tested in tension and the 4 and 6 % NaOH treatment resulted in the highest Young's modulus and tensile strength of 65 GPa and 1064 MPa respectively. The Young's modulus and tensile strength of untreated fibres were 38 GPa and 591 MPa respectively. The treated fibres with the highest strength were used as reinforcement for cashew nut shell liquid matrix. Nonwoven fibre mats and unidirectional fibre composites were manufactured by hand lay-up compression moulding. Tensile properties, porosity and fracture surface topography of the composites were analysed. The unidirectional fibre composites exhibited the best mechanical properties and composites with lowest porosity offered the highest mechanical properties. Increase in the moulding pressure resulted in {{a decrease in the}} mechanical properties except for untreated nonwoven hemp composites in which the presence of inherent binders in the fibres contributed to an enhanced fibre-matrix interface. The contribution of naturally occurring lignin-containing fibres with natural monomers containing similar phenolic compounds provides a compatible interaction on polymerisation hence improved mechanical properties.

In this way three alkaloid fractions of different polarities and retention on silica gel plates were obtained as: the most polar N-oxides {{of the highest}} retention, the tertiary bases of medium retention, and diesterified N-oxides of the lowest retention. The former fraction was reduced into free bases by sodium hydrosulfite and purified by LLP on Extrelut-NT 3 cartridge.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{diffusion}} of commonly administered analgesics, ibuprofen and paracetamol, through gastric mucus. As ibuprofen and paracetamol are often formulated with <b>alkalising</b> excipients, or are commonly co-administered with antacids that have been demonstrated to alter their absorption, diffusion was also studied in the presence of a range of soluble and insoluble antacids or buffering agents. The effect of pH, which has been demonstrated to modify the properties of mucus, was also studied. Mucus was a significant barrier to diffusion for both drugs, compared to an unstirred aqueous layer with diffusion rates significantly lower in the presence of a mucus barrier for both drugs; ibuprofen diffusion also demonstrated a significant increase in the lag time. Paracetamol diffusion was not significantly affected by addition of any antacid, whereas ibuprofen rates were affected and the diffusion lag time for ibuprofen was significantly reduced in all cases. Isolated increases in pH increased the rate and reduced the lag time for ibuprofen diffusion. It was shown that mucus acts as a passive barrier in the case of paracetamol diffusion, and an interactive barrier to ibuprofen diffusion. Changes in mucus viscosity at different pH values may be responsible for the observed changes in ibuprofen diffusion rate. © 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model of anaerobic muscle energy-metabolism {{was developed to}} predict pH and the concentrations of nine muscle metabolites over time. Phosphorous- 31 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance {{was used to measure}} time-course data for some phosphate metabolites and pH in anoxic M. semitendinosus taken from three slaughtered sheep. Muscles were held at 35 °C during the experiment. Measurement commenced 25 min post mortem and concluded before rigor mortis. The model was fitted to these data within experimental error, by simultaneously varying model parameter values and initial substrate concentrations. The model was used to simulate the period from death until metabolic activity ceased, in order to predict the different stages of metabolic response to anoxia. The model suggested that alkalinisation would occur in all three muscles in the first few minutes after the onset of anoxia, followed by a steady decline in pH. For two of the muscles this decline continued until rigor, with final pH values of 5. 60 and 6. 07. For the other muscle, pH reached a low of 5. 60 near rigor but then increased to a final value of 5. 73. A rise in pH after rigor has been observed but not previously explained in the literature.

40|$|The {{potential}} use of {{landfill gas}} as feeding {{fuel for the}} so called molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) imposes {{the need for new}} upgrading technologies {{in order to meet the}} much tougher feed gas specifications of this type of fuel cells in comparison to gas engines. Nevertheless, MCFC has slightly lower purity demands than low temperature fuel cells. This paper outlines the idea of a new catalytic purification process for landfill gas conditioning, which may be supposed to be more competitive than state-of-the-art technologies and summarises some lab-scale results. This catalytic process transforms harmful landfill gas minor compounds into products that can be easily removed from the gas stream by a subsequent adsorption step. The optimal process temperature was found to be in the range 250 - 400 °C. After a catalyst screening, two materials were identified, which have the ability to remove all harmful minor compounds from landfill gas. The first material was a commercial alumina that showed a high activity towards the removal of organic silicon compounds. The alumina protects both a subsequent catalyst for the removal of other organic minor compounds and the fuel cell. Due to gradual deactivation caused by silica deposition, the activated alumina needs to be periodically replaced. The second material was a commercial V 2 O 5 /TiO 2 -based catalyst that exhibited a high activity for the total oxidation of a broad spectrum of other harmful organic minor compounds into a simpler compound class "acid gases (HCl, HF and SO 2) ", which can be easily removed by absorption with e. g. <b>alkalised</b> alumina. The encouraging results obtained allow the scale-up of this LFG conditioning process to test it under real LFG conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{consumption}} of mineral waters is increasing in industrialised countries. High intakes of Ca and other <b>alkalising</b> cations {{as well as}} a low acid intake are beneficial to bone. We examined which components of mineral waters are conditioning their Ca content and their alkalinising power, in order to define the optimal profile. European mineral waters were randomly selected on the Internet: 100 waters with less than 200 mg Ca/l (9 · 98 mEq/l) and fifty with more than 200 mg/l, all with complete data for SO 4, P, Cl, Na, K, Mg and Ca, and most also for HCO 3. For comparison, forty North American mineral waters were randomly chosen. The potential renal acid load (PRAL) was calculated for each mineral water. North American waters did not reveal significant results because of their low mineralisation. We performed correlations between all eight components in order to explore the properties of the mineral waters. In the European waters, twenty-six out of twenty-eight correlations showed a P value of ≤ 0 · 01. In waters with PRAL > 0 (acidifying waters), PRAL was positively correlated with SO 4, Ca, K and Mg (P< 0 · 001). In those with PRAL < 0 (alkalinising waters), PRAL was negatively correlated with HCO 3, Na, Mg, Ca, K, Cl and SO 4 (P< 0 · 001). SO 4 and HCO 3 were not found together in high quantities in the same water for geochemical reasons. A high Ca content is associated with either a high SO 4 or a high HCO 3 content. SO 4 theoretically increases Ca excretion, while HCO 3 and low PRAL values are associated with positive effects on bone. Therefore, the best waters for bone health are rich in both HCO 3 and Ca, and by consequence low in SO...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDue to only few {{experimental}} evidences, {{the importance}} of root-induced alteration of metal dynamic speciation in the rhi-zosphere in the determination of metal bioavailability to plants is still a matter for debate. The present study thus investigated how root-induced changes in pH and dissolved organic matters (DOM) altered copper (Cu) dynamic speciation in the rhizo-sphere of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum durum L.). Plants were exposed to a Cu-contaminated soil previously <b>alkalised</b> by liming to cover soil pH values ranging from 4. 8 to 7. 5. A range of analytical techniques was deployed on soil exposed (i. e. in the rhizosphere) or not (i. e. in the bulk soil) to plant roots, including the measurement and the modelling (using the Humic Ion-Binding Model VI) of Cu 2 + activity, the measurement of labile Cu concentration and Cu lability by Differential Pulse Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (DPASV) and Diffusive Gradients in Thin films (DGT). Due to root-induced alkalisation, pH reached about 7. 3 in the rhizosphere whatever the initial bulk soil pH. Compared to the most acidic bulk soil (pH % 4. 8), Cu 2 + activity decreased by three orders of magnitude in the rhizosphere while DPASV-Cu concentration decreased by 6 -fold. DOM became the key driver of Cu dynamic speciation in the rhizosphere, where roots induced up to {{an order of magnitude}} increase in DOM concentration compared to bulk soils. This resulted in an increase in labile-Cu (both DPASV and DGT) concentrations, in spite of a decrease in Cu 2 + activity. Model VI calculations supported a decrease in DOM binding capacity towards Cu in the rhizosphere. DPASV measurements unequivocally demonstrated that the increase in Cu lability in the rhizosphere solution can be attributed to a greater lability of organically-bound Cu. Collectively, our data introduce a consistent picture of root-induced changes of Cu dynamic speciation in the rhizosphere that were notably related to substantial alterations of DOM binding capacity...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilisation}} of biogases, such as fermentation, sewage or {{landfill gas}} {{for power and}} heat generation requires mandatory tailor-made purification processes {{for the removal of}} all harmful pollutants. Biogenous gases, especially landfill gas (LFG), contain a wide range of minor compounds - e. g. sulphur-containing compounds, silicones, aromatics or chlorocarbons - in concentrations high enough to considerably damage or even rapidly destroy any downstream power generation device. Biogas utilisation has been mainly limited to power generation leaving most of the heat produced practically unused. Therefore, the application of more efficient systems like fuel cells has gained in recent years lots of impulse in both scientific and technical fields bringing these devices closer to commercialisation. Among all fuel cell types, hightemperature fuel cells (e. g. MCFC or SOFC) seem to be best suited for biogas utilisation due to their high power efficiency, feeding gas versatility, high operating temperatures and their lower purity demands. This contribution gives an overview of state-of-the-art biogas upgrading technologies and will figure out the challenges of biogas purification and the needs of further improvements, respectively. Finally, the author tries to draw future prospects and briefly introduce novel approaches regarding fuel cell purity demands and cost efficiency. Adsorption devices are the most applied gas cleaning technology due to their simple process design. Due to competing adsorption phenomena, this technology poorly fulfils gas quality demands and cost efficiency requests. Gas cooling or gas scrubbing technologies in conjunction with adsorption devices do not meet the cost efficiency nor the operational safety targets. These purification systems normally target single compound classes e. g. sulphur-containing compounds (H 2 S, mercaptans), halogenated and nohalogenated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and silicon-organic compounds (siloxanes). Fraunhofer UMSICHT researches on cost-effective catalytic gas cleaning devices able to eliminate all biogas impurities by transforming them into a simple compound class "acid gases" without compromising the methane contained in biogases. These acid gases (HCl, HF, SO 2) can be easily removed by adsorption on <b>alkalised</b> materials, resulting in a highpurity gas. The search for materials for the selective removal of siloxanes from biogases revealed an activated alumina for hot gas cleaning devices and a modified silica for retrofit applications (adsorption devices) as suitable materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to estimate the effect of different forms of sulphur on yields and qualitative parameters of white mustard seeds. This topic was studied in 2004 in the form of a pot trial in a vegetation hall and linked up with an identical experiment with spring wheat conducted in 2003. Besides the control variant not fertilised with sulphur (1) we fertilised the soil with elemental sulphur (2), ammonium sulphate (3) and gypsum (4) and applied foliar dressing of elemental sulphur with bentonite (5). For all variants the nitrogen dose was 0. 9 [*]g per pot (0. 15 [*]g .  kg− 1 of soil) and for va­riants 2 to 4 it was 1 [*]g of sulphur per pot (0. 17 [*]g. kg− 1 of soil). Foliar dressing of elemental sulphur (S 0) was not applied until the stage of six true leaves in a dose of 10 [*]kg per ha (0. 032 [*]g per pot). Significantly higher yields of white mustard seeds were achieved after foliar application of S 0 which can be also due to its fungicide action. The variants where gypsum was applied showed the highest average number of branches and pods and also straw yields. After gypsum fertilisation or foliar application of S 0 the oil content in the mustard seeds exceeded 25 %; this is the minimal content required for the production of good quality mustard. The 1000 -seed weight was significantly higher after foliar application of S 0. The proportion of seeds greyish on the surface, a sign of mildew, significantly decreased after fertilisation with all forms of sulphur, but most of all after foliar application of S 0. Fertilisation with ammonium sulphate reduced the exchangeable soil reaction after harvest. On the other hand gypsum <b>alkalised</b> the soil environment and increased the content of available calcium and water-soluble sulphur. The soil of the variant where foliar dressing of S 0 was applied had a higher content of available calcium after harvest. The least amount of available sulphur and phosphorus in the soil was seen after foliar application of S 0 signalising a more efficient uptake of nutrients from the soil for the production of seed yields and for the quality of the seeds...|$|R
40|$|Exogenous {{ingestion}} of <b>alkalising</b> agents, such as sodium bicarbonate (SB), {{has been shown}} to enhance muscle buffering capacity, thereby delaying the metabolic acidosis associated with high-intensity exercise and potentially improving performance. Aim: The aim of this research was {{to examine the effects of}} acute and chronic SB supplementation and a placebo (PLA) on high-intensity intermittent performance, recovery and subsequent performance in trained rugby union players. Methods: This aim was achieved through the completion of three interconnected studies. Study 1 examined the effects of acute versus chronic SB supplementation on high-intensity intermittent performance as assessed by 6 x 10 s maximal sprint tests on a cycle ergometer. Study 2 investigated effects of chronic SB supplementation on a specifically designed field-based, highintensity intermittent rugby sevens-specific protocol. Study 3 evaluated the effects of acute SB supplementation on an 80 -minute high-intensity intermittent 15 -a-side rugbyspecific protocol using elite females and sub-elite males. Results: In Study 1, acute SB supplementation demonstrated significant elevations in pre exercise levels for blood bicarbonate (StdHCO 3 -), pH and base excess (BE-Ecf) but no significant improvement in peak power output (PPO), mean power output (MPO) or total work (TW). Chronic SB supplementation exhibited a significant increase in StdHCO 3 - following Sprint 1. However, no significant differences in performance parameters were recorded for either acute or chronic SB supplementation when compared to the PLA trial. In Study 2, no significant differences in blood or performance related variables were observed between chronic SB and PLA supplementation trials. In Study 3, pre-exercise alkalosis was induced by acute SB supplementation in both elite females and sub-elite males. However, this did not translate into an ergogenic benefit to rugby union-specific performance. Vertical jump height and passing accuracy were significantly improved with PLA as opposed to SB supplementation in the elite female group. No significant differences in performance were observed between trials in the sub-elite male group. Conclusion: The major findings of this work suggest that pre-exercise metabolic alkalosis may be induced following acute but not chronic SB ingestion. However, results are inconclusive regarding the efficacy of acute or chronic SB ingestion to enhance performance in high intensity, intermittent performance indicative of the movement patterns and physiological demands associated with rugby union. Results also appear to indicate a high degree of individual variability, which, in part, may be due to potential gastrointestinal side effects of SB ingestion...|$|R
