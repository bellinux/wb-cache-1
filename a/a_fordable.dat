2500|$|One {{result of}} the {{narrowing}} of the East River along the shoreline of Manhattan and, later, Brooklyn [...] which continued until the mid-19th century when the state {{put a stop to}} it [...] was an increase in the speed of its current. Buttermilk Channel, the strait that divides Governors Island from Red Hook in Brooklyn, and which is located directly south of the [...] "mouth" [...] of the East River, was in the early 17th century <b>a</b> <b>fordable</b> waterway across which cattle could be driven. [...] Further investigation by Colonel Jonathan Williams determined that the channel was by 1776 three fathoms deep (...) , five fathoms deep (...) in the same spot by 1798, and when surveyed by Williams in 1807 had deepened to 7 fathoms (...) at low tide. [...] What had been almost a bridge between two landforms which were once connected had become a fully navigable channel, thanks to the constriction of the East River and the increased flow it caused. Soon, the current in the East River had become so strong that larger ships had to use auxiliary steam power in order to turn. [...] The continued narrowing of the channel on both side may have been the reasoning behind the suggestion of one New York State Senator, who wanted to fill in the East River and annex Brooklyn, with the cost of doing so being covered byselling the newly made land. [...] Others proposed a dam at Roosevelt Island (then Blackwell's Island) to create a wet basin for shipping.|$|E
50|$|Horsehead Crossing is a ford on the Pecos River in Crane County, {{southeast}} of Odessa, Texas.

50|$|Thorverton's {{population}} was once much larger as the village rested near {{the primary means}} for crossing the River Exe {{on the main road}} from London towards Cornwall. It remained so until the mid-18th century. Further to this, the bridge stands on the site of <b>an</b> ancient <b>fordable</b> crossing point and accounts for the main reason the village came into existence.|$|R
50|$|The castle {{was built}} on a point above the Aar river {{as part of the}} Limes Germanicus to protect <b>an</b> easily <b>fordable</b> stretch of the river. The castle was {{bell-shaped}} with an interior courtyard that was about 28.3 m long. The walls were 3 - 5 m thick and protected by six or eight half-round towers. The walls were additionally protected by two ditches. The height of the walls is unknown, but a 7.5 m tall section on south side is still visible, incorporated into the medieval Schlössli. The castle gate was on {{the eastern side of the}} castle and was flanked by two towers. Nothing is known about the number, location or purposes of the interior buildings.|$|R
60|$|The Indus {{had risen}} in flood without warning. Last {{night it was}} <b>a</b> <b>fordable</b> shallow; to-night five miles of raving muddy water parted bank and caving bank, and the river was still rising under the moon. A litter borne by six bearded men, all unused to the work, stopped in the white sand that bordered the whiter plain.|$|E
60|$|The {{object of}} their present {{incursion}} was to surprise an outpost of the American army stationed near <b>a</b> <b>fordable</b> {{part of the}} Croton River, not far from Pine's Bridge. The post was commanded by Colonel Christopher Greene, of Rhode Island, the same who had successfully defended Fort Mercer on the Delaware, when assailed by Count Donop. He was a valuable officer, highly prized by Washington. Colonel Delancey, who led this foray, was successor to the unfortunate André as adjutant-general of the British army. He conducted it secretly, and in the night, {{at the head of}} a hundred horse and two hundred foot. The Croton was forded at daybreak, just as the night-guard had been withdrawn, and the farm-houses were surprised and assailed in which the Americans were quartered. That occupied by Colonel Greene and a brother officer, Major Flagg, was first surrounded. The major started from his bed, and discharged his pistols from a window, but was shot through the head, and afterwards despatched by cuts and thrusts of the sabre.|$|E

50|$|Levi Ruggles, {{a veteran}} of the American Civil War, founded the town of Florence on the south bank of the Gila River. He came to Arizona Territory in 1866 as a U.S. Indian Agent. Recognizing the {{agricultural}} potential of the valley, he found <b>an</b> easily <b>fordable</b> crossing on the Gila River and surveyed a townsite there. With the aid of Governor R.C. McCormick, he secured a post office in August of the same year. Ruggles held numerous public offices including that of Territorial Legislator. Florence became the county seat in the newly formed Pinal County. Silver was discovered in 1875 in the nearby mountains which {{led to the creation of}} the famous Silver King Mine.|$|R
60|$|The {{spot where}} the army had landed was a sandy island, a league in length, and very narrow, {{separated}} from the mainland by <b>a</b> channel <b>fordable</b> at low water, without any green thing growing on it, and with only one spring of fresh water, which was guarded by a tower filled with Moorish soldiers. A hundred men would have been sufficient to dislodge them; but few horses had been landed, and those were injured by their voyage, and the knights could do nothing without them. The men who {{went in search of}} water were killed by the Moorish guard, and thirst, together with the burning heat of the sun reflected by the arid sand, caused the Christians to suffer terribly.|$|R
50|$|By the Middle Ages malaria {{had reached}} Britain, locally endemic in the south. There were hot spots {{of this disease}} along {{the course of the}} river Thames as well as at Romney Marsh, so one might expect that the Brent Valley could also have harboured the disease; thus living near it may have been too {{unhealthy}} to encourage many settlements. Only at places where the river gravel beds afforded a firm river bed was fording a safe and practical proposition. Some such fording places were the Roman road crossing in Brentford itself, Green Lanes in Hanwell (a reminder that this was an old droving route, the word 'green' signifying that livestock could graze whilst on their last journey), and Hanwell Bridge on the Uxbridge Road. With only <b>a</b> few <b>fordable</b> places along the river's course, this presented an ideal natural defensive barrier.|$|R

50|$|Haining has {{previously}} been recorded on older maps, probably in error, as 'Hatting.' If correct this place name could be derived from the Gaelic athan meaning <b>a</b> 'ford or <b>fordable</b> river'. Haining Place stands beside an old ford and stepping stones. In Scots the more recent recorded name of 'Haining' is a 'fence, hedge or wall forming the boundary of an enclosure or a piece or stretch of ground enclosed in this way so as to protect a hay crop' from cattle, deer, etc. It {{is worth noting that}} at one time Haining had a lengthy pale or fence around its old deer park.|$|R
60|$|Next {{morning we}} left Nongoma {{early in the}} hope of {{reaching}} Ulundi that evening if the Ivuna and Black Umfolozi Rivers proved <b>fordable.</b> <b>As</b> it chanced, although they were high, we were able to cross them, I seated on the horse which two of the Zulus led. Next we tramped for miles through the terrible Bekameezi Valley, a hot and desolate place which the Zulus swear is haunted. So unhealthy is this valley, which is the home of large game, that whole kraals full of people who have tried to cultivate the rich land, have died in it of fever, or fled away leaving their crops unreaped. Now no man dwells there. After this we climbed a terrible mount to the high land of Mahlabatini, and having eaten, pushed on once more.|$|R
60|$|The {{story was}} a premeditated sham, {{and not a}} word of truth in it, invented to raise their spirits, and cheat {{them out of their}} cowardly phlegmatic apprehensions, and my lord had his end in it; for they were all on fire to fall on. And I am persuaded, had they been led {{immediately}} into a battle begun to their hands, they would have laid about them like furies; for there is nothing like victory to flush a young soldier. Thus, while the humour was high, and the fermentation lasted, away we marched, and, passing one of their great commons, which they call moors, we came to the river, as he called it, where our lieutenant was posted with his four men; 'twas <b>a</b> little brook <b>fordable</b> with ease, and, leaving a guard at the pass, we advanced {{to the top of a}} small ascent, from whence we had a fair view of the Scots army, as they lay behind another river larger than the former.|$|R
50|$|Jain {{cosmology}} {{divides the}} worldly cycle of time {{into two parts}} (avasarpiṇī and utsarpiṇī). According to Jain belief, in every half-cycle of time, twenty-four Tīrthaṅkaras are born in the human realm to discover and teach the Jain doctrine appropriate for that era. The word tīrthankara signifies the founder of a tirtha, which means <b>a</b> <b>fordable</b> passage across a sea. The Tīrthaṅkaras show the 'fordable path' across the sea of interminable births and deaths. Rishabhanatha {{is said to be}} the first Tīrthankara of the present half-cycle (avasarpiṇī). Mahāvīra (6th century BC) is revered as the twenty fourth tīrthankara of avasarpiṇī. Jain texts explain that Jainism has always existed and will always exist.|$|E
50|$|Kuroki {{was thus}} able to {{maneuver}} against the weak Russian left, and deployed the 12th Division and Guards Division across the Yalu River at <b>a</b> <b>fordable</b> point. The Russians observed these movements with trepidation, and General Kashtalinsky informed General Zasulich that the Japanese {{were about to}} assault the position in force and his position {{was in danger of}} being flanked. Zasulich chose to ignore the reports, thinking that the attack was only a feint, and redeployed a single battalion with four guns. Zasulitch remained convinced that the main Japanese attack would fall at Antung, and kept his main force as well as his reserves at that location.|$|E
5000|$|In Jainism, a tirthankara (Sanskrit [...] ) is a saviour {{and spiritual}} {{teacher of the}} dharma (righteous path). The word tirthankara signifies the founder of a tirtha, which is <b>a</b> <b>fordable</b> passage across the sea of interminable births and deaths, the saṃsāra. According to Jains, a tirthankara is a rare {{individual}} who has conquered the saṃsāra, the cycle of death and rebirth, {{on his own and}} made a path for others to follow. After understanding {{the true nature of the}} Self or soul, the Tīrthaṅkara attains Kevala Jnana (omniscience), and the first Tirthankara refounds Jainism. Tirthankara provides a bridge for others to follow the new teacher from saṃsāra to moksha (liberation).|$|E
6000|$|If Washington was chagrined by {{the signal}} failure of this expedition, he was cheered by the better fortune of one set on foot {{about the same}} time, under his own eye, by his young friend, Major Henry Lee of the Virginia dragoons. This active and daring officer had {{frequently}} been employed by him in scouring {{the country on the}} west side of the Hudson to collect information; keep an eye upon the enemy's posts; cut off their supplies, and check their foraging parties. The coup de main at Stony Point had piqued his emulation. In the course of his reconnoitring, and by means of spies, he had discovered that the British post at Paulus Hook, immediately opposite to New York, was very negligently guarded. Paulus Hook is a long low point of the Jersey shore, stretching into the Hudson, and connected to the main land by a sandy isthmus. A fort had been erected on it, and garrisoned with four or five hundred men, under the command of Major Sutherland. It was a strong position. <b>A</b> creek, <b>fordable</b> only in two places, rendered the hook difficult of access. Within this, a deep trench had been cut across the isthmus, traversed by a drawbridge with a barred gate; and still within this was a double row of abatis, extending into the water. Confident in the strength of his position, and its distance from any American force, Major Sutherland had become remiss in his military precautions. All this had been ascertained by Major Lee; and he now proposed the daring project of surprising the fort at night, and thus striking an insulting blow [...] "within cannon shot of New York." [...] Washington was disposed to favor the adventurous schemes of this young officer.|$|R
60|$|A cannonade {{was kept}} up {{on both sides}} until dark; but with little damage to the Americans. When night closed in, the two camps lay in sight of each other's fires, ruminating the bloody action of the {{following}} day. It was the most gloomy and anxious night that had yet closed in on the American army throughout its series of perils and disasters; for there was no concealing the impending danger. But {{what must have been}} the feelings of the commander-in-chief as he anxiously patrolled his camp and considered his desperate position? <b>A</b> small stream, <b>fordable</b> in several places, was all that separated his raw, inexperienced army from an enemy vastly superior in numbers and discipline, and stung to action by the mortification of a late defeat. In this darkest of moments a gleam of hope flashed upon his mind: a bold expedient suggested itself. Almost the whole of the enemy's force must by this time be drawn out of Princeton and advancing by detachments toward Trenton, while their baggage and principal stores must remain weakly guarded at Brunswick. Was it not possible by a rapid night-march along the Quaker road, a different road from that on which General Leslie with the rear-guard was resting, to get past that force undiscovered, come by surprise upon those left at Princeton, capture or destroy what stores were left there, and then push on to Brunswick? This would save the army from being cut off; would avoid the appearance of a defeat; and might draw the enemy away from Trenton, while some fortunate stroke might give additional reputation to the American arms.|$|R
60|$|So {{soon as the}} {{dismounted}} squadrons {{had begun}} their advance, Colonel Byng led the two who were to cover it forward. The wood we were to reach and find shelter in was about a thousand yards distant, and had been reported unoccupied by the Boers, who indeed confined themselves strictly to the hills after their rough handling on the 18th by the cavalry. We moved off at a walk, spreading into a wide open order, as wise colonial cavalry always do. And it was fortunate that our formation was a dispersed one, for no sooner had we moved into the open ground than there was the flash of a gun faraway among the hills to the westward. I had had some experience of artillery fire in the armoured train episode, but there the guns were firing at such close quarters that {{the report of the}} discharge and the explosion of the shell were almost simultaneous. Nor had I ever heard the menacing hissing roar which heralds the approach of a long-range projectile. It came swiftly, passed overhead with a sound like the rending of thin sheets of iron, and burst with a rather dull explosion in the ground a hundred yards behind the squadrons, throwing up smoke and clods of earth. We broke into a gallop, and moved in curving course towards the wood. I suppose we were a target a hundred yards broad by a hundred and fifty deep. The range was not less than seven thousand yards, and we were at the gallop. Think of this, Inspector-General of Artillery: the Boer gunners fired ten or eleven shells, every one of which fell among or within a hundred yards of our ranks. Between us and the wood ran a deep donga with <b>a</b> river only <b>fordable</b> in places flowing through it. Some confusion occurred in crossing this, but at last the whole regiment was across, and found shelter from the terrible gun--perhaps there were two--on the further bank. Thanks to our dispersed formation only two horses had been killed, and it was possible to admire without having to deplore the skill of the artillerists who could make such beautiful practice at such a range.|$|R
50|$|This was {{the only}} island on the loch and was thought {{as late as the}} 1860s to have been built by one of the lairds as a retreat for swans, geese, or other water fowl during the {{breeding}} season. It had <b>a</b> <b>fordable</b> causeway leading out to it and rose about 2.5 feet above the water level, clothed in trees and grasses. The southern end of the loch was the site of infill with slag and other wastes from 1841 onwards. By the 1860s 'The Cairn' had become distorted and shifted by the movement of the sediment on the loch caused by the weight of the infill, revealing the presence of a crannog lake dwelling (see 'Archaeology'). Infill operations completely destroyed then island in due course.|$|E
50|$|Värnamo traces {{its history}} {{back to a}} village in the medieval age; the first written mention of it stems from the 13th century. It came into {{existence}} as a village to {{the eastern side of}} <b>a</b> <b>fordable</b> place over the Lagan, a river that for large parts is difficult to travel by. As there are also smaller streams to the south and west of this location, it was considered something of a safeguard, leading to its name being amalgamated from the two Swedish words värn, which means safeguard, and mo which is a geographical location reference describing the kind of land on which the town is situated. The word mo actually means that the soil consists of fine sand, sometimes making the land surrounding the river bog or barren.|$|E
50|$|The Son {{river at}} 784 km long, {{is one of}} the longest Indian rivers. Its chief tributaries are the Rihand and the North Koel. The Son has a steep {{gradient}} (35-55 cm per km) with quick run-off and ephemeral regimes, becoming a roaring river with the rain-waters in the catchment area but turning quickly into <b>a</b> <b>fordable</b> stream. The Son, being wide and shallow, leaves disconnected pools of water in the remaining parts of the year. The channel of the Son is very wide (about 5 km at Dehri on sone) but the floodplain is narrow, only 3 to 5 km wide. In the past, the Son has been notorious for changing course, as it is traceable from several old beds near its east bank. In modern times this tendency has been checked with the anicut at Dehri, and now more so with the Indrapuri Barrage.|$|E
50|$|Thirlmere is a {{reservoir}} in the Borough of Allerdale in Cumbria and the English Lake District. The Helvellyn ridge lies {{to the east}} of Thirlmere. To the west of Thirlmere are a number of fells; for instance, Armboth Fell and Raven Crag both of which give views of the lake and of Helvellyn beyond.It runs roughly south to north and is bordered on the eastern side for much of its length by the A591 road and on the western side by a minor road. It occupies the site of a former natural lake: this had <b>a</b> <b>fordable</b> waist so narrow that it was (and is) sometimes regarded as two lakes. In the 19th century Manchester Corporation constructed a dam at the northern end, raising the water level, flooding the valley bottom, and creating {{a reservoir}} to provide the growing industrial city of Manchester with water supplies via the 96 mile-long Thirlmere Aqueduct. The reservoir and the aqueduct still provide water to the Manchester area, but under the Water Act 1973 ownership passed to the North West Water Authority; as a result of subsequent privatisation and amalgamation they (and the catchment area surrounding the reservoir) are now owned and managed by United Utilities, a private water and waste water company.|$|E
