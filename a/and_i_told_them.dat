[...] I blew a whistle, and the first game of basketball began. [...] … [...] The boys began tackling, kicking and punching in the clinches. [...] They ended up in a free-for-all in the middle of the gym floor. [...] “It certainly was murder.” [...] The most important one was that there should be no running with the ball. [...] That stopped tackling and slugging. We tried out the game with those [...] rules (fouls), and we didn’t have one casualty.” ...|$|E
500|$|Halifax {{started off}} Game 5 {{at home on}} a low note, with Liam McMorrow {{committing}} four personal fouls {{in the first three}} minutes. Nevertheless, Halifax pulled away with the 125–91 victory, putting them one win away from the title. Rainmen forward Forrest Fisher complained about Windsor, [...] "They're playing very physical, and at times a little bit dirty with sucker punches, and we started playing into their game (Friday) and that's not us. A couple of us can play like that, myself included, and we came out tonight <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> 'hey, let me take the hits, I'm used to that. You guys play your normal game.' We play the way we play, and it doesn't matter how they play." [...] According to The Chronicle Herald, [...] "the game featured several incidents that threatened to escalate into a full-scale brawl." [...] The teams' coaches would frequently have to break up skirmishes and confront officials for what they felt were bad calls.|$|E
500|$|On {{the final}} cut privilege, Spielberg was {{dissatisfied}} with the film. Columbia Pictures was experiencing financial problems, and they were depending on this film to save their company. [...] "I wanted to have another six months to finish off this film, and release it in summer 1978. They told me they needed this film out immediately," [...] Spielberg explained. [...] "Anyway, Close Encounters was a huge financial success <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> I wanted {{to make my own}} director's cut. They agreed on the condition that I show the inside of the mothership so they could have something to hang a [...] campaign on. I never should have shown the inside of the mother ship." [...] In 1979, Columbia gave Spielberg $1.5million to produce what became the [...] "Special Edition" [...] of the film. Spielberg added seven minutes of new footage, but also deleted or shortened various existing scenes by a total of ten minutes, so that the Special Edition was three minutes shorter than the original 1977 release. The Special Edition featured several new character development scenes, the discovery of the SS Cotopaxi in the Gobi Desert, and a view of the inside of the mothership. Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Special Edition was released in August 1980, making a further $15.7million, accumulating a final $303.7million box office gross. Roger Ebert [...] "thought the original film was an astonishing achievement, capturing the feeling of awe and wonder we have when considering the likelihood of life beyond the Earth. ... This new version ... is, quite simply, a better film ... Why didn't Spielberg make it this good the first time?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They stole stationery, spittoons, waste baskets, by God! They stole {{everything}} that was loose, {{and at the end}} of the term, they seemed to be looking around unsatisfied, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> there was just one thing left--the gold leaf on the dome." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I ’ave ’ad {{them two}} ladies down agin asking for Mr. Robinson, {{and also for}} poor Cap’n Flower," [...] said the watchman; [...] "they asked me some {{questions}} about ’im, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>’em</b> the lies wot {{you told me to}} tell ’em, Joe; p’r’aps that’s w’y I ’ad the warning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ain't it the {{greatest}} ever!" [...] he cried. [...] "You ain't done no damage at all. The carpenters put that wooden slide up wrong, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> they'd {{have to take}} it down, and they started to-day. That's what made them bracin's bust. The hull thing is comin' down,--so what you did don't hurt, nohow." ...|$|R
2500|$|You know, {{its engine}} sound was {{different}} from other planes; that is, the president's engine's sound ... We were looking towards where the plane was coming from, and we saw a projectile and we saw a ball of flame or flash and we saw the plane go down; and I saw it. I {{was the leader of}} the bloc so I asked the soldiers to get up <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> [...] "Get up because Kinani [...] has been shot down.' They told me, [...] "You are lying." [...] I said, [...] "It's true." [...] So I opened my wardrobe, I put on my uniform and I heard the bugle sound.|$|E
2500|$|Kirsten {{told police}} he went to Cornell’s room at 12:15a.m., but couldn't access the locked room. He then had a {{telephone}} conversation with Vicky Cornell. [...] "I told Vicky that they wouldn’t come {{open the door and}} she told me to kick it open. I did. Upon entry, I found the bedroom door locked. I called the hotel operator and told her that I needed security to open the bedroom door. They refused again, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that I’m going to damage the hotel room and (they) need to send security, call 911 and call an ambulance. I kicked the bedroom door 6-7 times before it somehow popped open. I went inside and the bathroom door was partially opened and I could see his feet." [...] Kirsten told police in a signed statement. Kirsten said that Vicky {{was on the phone with}} him the whole time asking for updates, [...] "She told me that she called the front desk and they hung up on her. It was a female. She called back a couple minutes later and a male answered, saying that it was (the first) that he was hearing about the incident." [...] Kirsten said in his statement that he loosened the band around Cornell's neck then tried to resuscitate him by compressing his chest. Medical personnel arrived at 12:56 a.m and tried to resuscitate the singer with no success. Cornell was pronounced dead at 1:30a.m., an hour and 15 minutes after his bodyguard was first contacted by Cornell's wife. It's unknown how long it took the bodyguard to gain entry to the hotel room and find Cornell.|$|E
60|$|We {{began to}} talk about my aunt's losses, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> what I had tried to do that morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no {{fight with}} you," [...] <b>I</b> cried, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> who <b>I</b> was <b>and</b> added {{that if they}} would live in peace they must sooner or later join forces with me.|$|R
60|$|Lord Langerdale {{questioned}} me concerning it, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> everything--told them of our suspicions {{in connection}} with Mr. Marx and of my determination to find him out, and discover whether he had been guilty of foul play towards the man Hart.|$|R
60|$|The Committee {{are very}} anxious to have you for a steward, {{as one of the}} heads of a large class; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>I</b> have no doubt you will act. There is no steward's fee or {{collection}} whatever.|$|R
6000|$|... "They fed me, {{for they}} could see I was starving, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> about the mine--and, well, some way I got them to 'grub-stake' me that night." ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{went out}} into the front yard I found Mr. Poplington and Jone sitting on a little stone bench, for they was tired, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> about that young woman and Davy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I {{think it}} is no use; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> all so from the first. The truth is, sir, they want a picture of my--of our schoolmistress, to hang up in the school or somewhere--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn’t {{speak for}} a time, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> could ’e stopped {{me with the}} mop agin. It was like a chained lion being tormented by a monkey. I stepped down on to the cabin floor, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>’em</b> both wot <b>I</b> thought of ’em.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I said nothing. I {{wanted to}} get out. I paid my fine, and bought a new hat, and came up here before noon next morning. There {{were a lot of}} people in the house, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> I'd been unavoidably detained, and then they began to {{recollect}} engagements elsewhere. Hackman must have seen the fight on the track and made a story of it. I suppose they thought it was distinctly American--confound 'em! It's the only time in my life that I've ever flagged a train, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't have done it but for that scarab. 'T wouldn't hurt their old trains to be held up once in a while." ...|$|R
5000|$|Erving recalled, [...] "Later on, in the Rucker Park {{league in}} Harlem, when people started calling me 'Black Moses' <b>and</b> 'Houdini', <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{if they wanted}} to call me anything, call me 'Doctor,'" [...] Over time, the {{nickname}} evolved into [...] "Dr. Julius," [...] and finally [...] "Dr. J." ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{next the}} lover: [...] "Little I knew, [...] Madam, {{you had a}} third! [...] Kissing here in my very view!" [...] --Husband and lover then withdrew. I let them; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> not they erred.|$|E
60|$|I {{sat down}} to an English breakfast and ate {{with a sort of}} languid {{appetite}}--an appetite many weeks old and very decrepit--and stirred myself to answer the questions of the four young men. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> the truth.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I met him on {{the road}} with Lady Hester Perrault, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them.</b> I walked back to Spinney Lawn with them. But," [...] as I began to thank her, and her voice went lower still, [...] "but--oh, Ursula, Lady Hester knew it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} open the door. Some stones had fallen against it, and fearing to get punished, I {{made my way}} back into the council room. It was empty when I reached it. They were searching for me in the other rooms, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never <b>told</b> <b>them</b> of my adventure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{consulted}} me {{at breakfast}} (they had ordered sweet milk and water, and toast and currant jelly, over night) about the pony, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> {{that it did}} unfortunately happen that the pony was half clipped, but that he'd be finished clipping {{in the course of}} the day, and that to-morrow morning at eight o'clock he would be ready. My own opinion is that Mrs. Harry Walmers junior was beginning to give in. She hadn't had her hair curled when she went to bed, and she didn't seem quite up to brushing it herself, and it getting into her eyes put her out. But nothing put out Mr. Harry. He sat behind his breakfast cup tearing away at the jelly, as if he'd been his own father.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a strange}} manner in which <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> my love. <b>I</b> had roared my burning words of passion through a speaking-trumpet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> not to Bertha herself, but to Mary Phillips. But the manner was of no importance. Bertha now knew that I loved her. That was {{everything}} to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wegg and Thompson bought it. I {{was angry}} at the time, because their {{withdrawal}} had driven me into a tight corner to protect my investment, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> they would bitterly regret their action. I think Wegg agreed with me, but Will Thompson was still stubborn.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course {{many people}} were {{at work in the}} yam grounds, several of which I saw; but I found {{considerable}} parties at the different villages, and had, on the whole, satisfactory conversations with them. They listened and asked questions, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> as well as I could the simplest truths of Christianity.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{now called}} the men around me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> all my story. You may imagine that they opened their eyes and mouths so wide that I thought {{some of them would}} never get them shut again. But the captain--he was from Provincetown, Cape Cod, and he went {{straight}} to business.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{he was in}} it, {{and some}} ladies, and they stopped and asked Rectus <b>and</b> <b>I</b> how we got along with our queen, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> all about it, {{you ought to have}} heard them laugh, and the governor, he said, that Poqua-dilla shouldn't suffer after we went away, even if he had to get all his pepper-pods from her. Now, wasn't that good?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't come; {{the neighbors}} brought me," [...] replied the little man, {{with a frown}} at the recollection. [...] "They said <b>I</b> was quarrelsome <b>and</b> {{fault-finding}} and blamed me because <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{all the things that}} went wrong, or never were right, <b>and</b> because <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> how things ought to be. So they brought me here and left me all alone, saying that if I quarreled with myself, no one else would be made unhappy. Absurd, wasn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yuh, but say, {{any of you}} fellows ever stay at the Rippleton, in Chicago? I don't want to knock--I {{believe in}} {{boosting}} wherever you can--but say, of all the rotten dumps that pass 'emselves off as first-class hotels, that's the worst. I'm going to get those guys, one of these days, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> so. You know how I am--well, maybe you don't know, but I'm accustomed to first-class accommodations, and I'm perfectly {{willing to pay a}} reasonable price. I got into Chicago late the other night, and the Rippleton's near the station--I'd never been there before, but I says to the taxi-driver--I always believe in taking a taxi when you get in late; may cost a little more money, but, gosh, it's worth it when you got to be up early next morning and out selling a lot of crabs--and I said to him, 'Oh, just drive me over to the Rippleton.' ...|$|R
60|$|When I came rightly to my remembrance, they {{questioned}} me {{as to what}} I had seen and heard in the Red Room. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> as best I could, though much aggrieved that to my questions they would answer nothing save to bid me to stay still and think not of the matter.|$|E
6000|$|Lord Rotherwood went on. 'They {{asked me}} who Miss Dolores Mohun was, and I {{could do no}} {{otherwise}} than tell them, and likewise where to find her, but I explained {{that she is a}} mere child; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> I would come down here, so I hope you will have as little annoyance as possible.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do {{not look}} so very ugly, my darling, do I? Not so very ugly? though they have cut off all my poor hair, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> so often not! But I kept a lock for you;' and feebly she drew from under the pillow a long auburn tress, and tried to wreathe it round his neck, but could not, and sunk back.|$|E
6000|$|To {{begin with}} {{there was a}} good deal of tension, Marion was frightfully nervous and every one was under the {{necessity}} of behaving in a mysteriously unreal fashion until I plunged, became talkative and made a certain ease <b>and</b> interest. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> of the schools, of my lodgings, of Wimblehurst and my apprenticeship days. [...] "There's a lot of this Science about nowadays," [...] Mr. Ramboat reflected; [...] "but I sometimes wonder a bit what good it is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Father Dolan <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> all {{at dinner}} about it, Father Dolan <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{had a great}} laugh over it. YOU BETTER MIND YOURSELF FATHER DOLAN, said I, OR YOUNG DEDALUS WILL SEND YOU UP FOR TWICE NINE. We had a famous laugh {{together}} over it. Ha! Ha! Ha! ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{had kept}} silent {{simply because they}} {{thought that they were}} not called to say anything; <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>I</b> {{intended}} to run into Singapore and that the best chance for the ship and the men was in the efforts all of us, sick and well, must make to get her along out of this, I received the encouragement of a low assenting murmur and of a louder voice exclaiming: [...] "Surely there is {{a way out of this}} blamed hole." ...|$|R
