5|$|In the United Kingdom, Fisher {{returned}} to his old post as First Sea Lord; he had been created 1st Baron Fisher in 1909, taking the motto Fear God <b>and</b> <b>dread</b> nought. This, combined with a government moratorium on battleship building, meant a renewed focus on the battlecruiser. Fisher resigned in 1915 following arguments about the Gallipoli Campaign with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|The 1970s and 1980s saw {{a wave of}} landbased pirate radio, {{broadcasting}} {{mostly in}} big cities. These included community-focused local stations such as Sunshine Radio in Shropshire and Radio Jackie in south west London. In London pirate stations emerged that, {{for the first time}} in UK radio broadcasting, focused on particular music genres such as Radio Invicta (92.4 FM) Europe's first soul station, started in 1970. Kiss FM (dance), Solar Radio (soul), Raiders FM, Radio Amanda and Radio Floss (rock) <b>and</b> <b>Dread</b> Broadcasting Corporation (reggae).|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that the architecture of government columbaria reflects the outlook of the Singaporean nation. The early columbaria were simple, with few aesthetic ornaments, just like early Singaporean housing flats. The later columbaria have more modern designs, with well-designed landscaped environments, and looking similar to contemporary HDB (Housing and Development Board) flats. These columbaria include the Chua Chu Kang Columbarium and the Mandai Columbarium, which was renovated and expanded in 2004 to accommodate approximately another 60,000 niches. The designs are more elaborate, and are often reminiscent of other structures people often encounter in everyday life. Comparisons have been drawn between the architecture of these columbaria and that of schools and condominiums, and hypotheses have been made that such are deliberate efforts to eliminate the sense of fear <b>and</b> <b>dread</b> traditionally associated with landscapes of death.|$|E

25|$|Reviewers {{have pointed}} out that the show {{effectively}} utilizes a number of cinematic techniques common in horror film. The editing leaves open the question of whether paranormal activity is actually occurring, and the cinematography uses night-vision and infrared photography to create a suspenseful atmosphere. The writing on the show is particularly effective at creating a sense of portent <b>and</b> <b>dread,</b> one reviewer noted, and the music and graphics contribute effectively to the tension and fear as well.|$|E
25|$|Laurent {{took a few}} steps, not speaking. He {{removed his}} jacket and vest. In shirtsleeves, he glanced again at Thérèse, who had not stirred. He seemed to hesitate. Then he noticed the pink shoulder, and bent down to press his {{trembling}} lips against that bit of bare skin. The young woman pulled her shoulder away, turning around abruptly. She stared at Laurent with a gaze so strangely mingling repugnance <b>and</b> <b>dread</b> that he stepped back, troubled and uneasy, as if overcome with terror and disgust himself.|$|E
25|$|According to existentialism, {{each man}} and each woman creates the essence (meaning) of their life; {{life is not}} {{determined}} by a supernatural god or an earthly authority, one is free. As such, one's ethical prime directives are action, freedom, and decision, thus, existentialism opposes rationalism and positivism. In seeking meaning to life, the existentialist looks to where people find meaning in life, in course of which using only reason {{as a source of}} meaning is insufficient; this gives rise to the emotions of anxiety <b>and</b> <b>dread,</b> felt in considering one's free will, and the concomitant awareness of death. According to Jean-Paul Sartre, existence precedes essence; the (essence) of one's life arises only after one comes to existence.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{a lack of}} {{stability}} and struggles with the imperialists, Sultan Shire was secretly invited to a conference in Yemen, ostensibly to discuss possible ways of settling differences. After a short session before the meeting was scheduled to begin, he {{was taken into custody}} by the British authorities. Sultan Shire was later tried without proper representation in a kangaroo court. Due to the Sultan's vehement and active opposition to foreign rule over his territory <b>and</b> <b>dread</b> {{on the part of the}} British of the prospect of another twenty years of costly and protracted battles with yet another Somali potentate, he was sentenced to exile in the Seychelles for a period of seven years (a place where the British often confined prominent anti-imperialist leaders). However, Shire continued to play a prominent role in local affairs until his eventual death a few months after independence, as the British administration sought his support before introducing any major policy changes so as to avoid alienating the influential leader.|$|E
500|$|Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park is a United States National Park {{located in}} western Colorado and {{managed by the}} National Park Service. There are two primary {{entrance}}s to the park: the south rim entrance is located [...] east of Montrose, while the north rim entrance is [...] south of Crawford and is closed in the winter. The park contains [...] of the [...] long Black Canyon of the Gunnison River. The national park itself contains the deepest and most dramatic section of the canyon, but the canyon continues upstream into Curecanti National Recreation Area and downstream into Gunnison Gorge National Conservation Area. The canyon's name owes itself {{to the fact that}} parts of the gorge only receive 33 minutes of sunlight a day, according to Images of America: The Black Canyon of the Gunnison. In the book, author Duane Vandenbusche states, [...] "Several canyons of the American West are longer and some are deeper, but none combines the depth, sheerness, narrowness, darkness, <b>and</b> <b>dread</b> of the Black Canyon." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{romantic and}} emotionally charged {{aspects of the}} film were equally praised. Andrew L. Urban of Urban Cinefile said, [...] "You will walk out of Titanic not talking about budget or running time, but of its {{enormous}} emotive power, big as the engines of the ship itself, determined as its giant propellers to gouge into your heart, and as lasting as the love story that propels it." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly described the film as, [...] "A lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom. Writer-director James Cameron has restaged the defining catastrophe of the early 20th century on a human scale of such purified yearning <b>and</b> <b>dread</b> that he touches the deepest levels of popular moviemaking." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times commented that [...] "Cameron's magnificent Titanic is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to Gone With the Wind." [...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine, on the other hand, wrote a mostly negative review, criticizing the lack of interesting emotional elements.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of Uncle David were mixed. Writing in The Guardian, Ben Walters {{noted that}} [...] "suspense <b>and</b> <b>dread</b> {{accumulate}} as the low-key naturalism and the characters' obvious affection {{for one another}} play off against the enormity of what looms ahead." [...] Comparing Uncle David to Hoyle's earlier stage work, {{he felt that the}} two were [...] "consistent", but that in the film Hoyle abandoned the [...] "fireworks of his performance persona", opting for a [...] "controlled, beguiling style". He believed that Ryder's familiarity with being filmed meant that he carried a [...] "disarmingly ingenuous presence, by turns determined and naive." [...] Walters opined that the film's [...] "menacing" [...] use of British seaside locations was similar to that in Brighton Rock and London to Brighton, while he also drew comparisons to Badlands, Bonnie and Clyde and The Talented Mr. Ripley, in that in all of them, the viewers' sympathy for the characters eclipses moral judgement of their actions. Walters would follow this with another review published in Time Out, in which he awarded the film five stars out of five.|$|E
500|$|U2 biographer Bill Flanagan credits Bono's {{habit of}} keeping his lyrics [...] "in flux {{until the last}} minute" [...] with {{providing}} a narrative coherence to the album. Flanagan interpreted Achtung Baby as using the moon {{as a metaphor for}} a dark woman seducing the singer away from his virtuous love, the sun; he is tempted away from domestic life by an exciting nightlife and tests how far he can go before returning home. For Flanagan, the final three songs on Achtung Baby—"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)", [...] "Acrobat", and [...] "Love Is Blindness"—are about how the couple deal with the suffering they have forced on each other. Uncut contributor Gavin Martin believed the song contained [...] "images of love, debased or abandoned." [...] He wrote, [...] "With its stark, churchlike organ intro, pulsating bass synth and guitar reverb stretched into a hallucinatory squall, it brilliantly describes the discord <b>and</b> <b>dread</b> that provide a constant undertow to Achtung Baby. And yet, through its alluring sonic palette and wounded but sensual vocal, 'Love Is Blindness' also maps out a search for harmony and salvation".|$|E

2500|$|Tryal Rocks, {{sometimes}} spelled Trial Rocks or Tryall Rocks, {{formerly known}} as Ritchie's Reef or the Greyhound's Shoal, is a reef of rock located in the Indian Ocean off the northwest coast of Australia, [...] northwest of {{the outer edge of}} the Montebello Islands group. It is named for the Tryall, the first known shipwreck in Australian waters, which sunk after striking the then-uncharted rocks in 1622.

2500|$|Game Informers Jeremy Zoss {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 and Xbox {{versions}} 8.25 out of 10, writing [...] "if titles like Fatal Frame represent the psychological end of horror gaming, then The Suffering {{is the equivalent}} of a splatter flick." [...] He concluded [...] "while I have many positive things to say about this title, I cannot stress enough that it's not for everyone. Like a Friday the 13th movie, I would hardly call this game scary; it lacks the claustrophobia <b>and</b> <b>dread</b> of a survival horror title. It is, however, filled with tons of gore, vulgarity, and offensive material [...] If you think Peter Jackson's true masterpiece is Dead Alive, you'll be right at home with The Suffering." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{lure of the}} {{countryside}} could prove a distraction to an active boy, who needed to be pulled back into line. Henry Dowes wrote to Cromwell in September 1534 explaining that he had used every effort to advance Gregory in his studies, but “forcause summer was spent {{in the service of}} the wild gods, it is so much to be regarded after what fashion youth is brought up.” However, by April 1535, Dowes was able to report to his father that [...] "his improvement is greater than at any time here before, partly because he is brought into some awe <b>and</b> <b>dread,</b> and is ready to give himself to learning when required, partly because those things which formerly alienated his mind from study are now withdrawn." ...|$|E
2500|$|Copland never {{enrolled}} as {{a member}} of any political party. Nevertheless, he inherited a considerable interest in civic and world events from his father. His views were generally progressive and he had strong ties with numerous colleagues and friends in the Popular Front, including Odets. Early in his life, Copland [...] developed, in Pollack's words, [...] "a deep admiration for the works of Frank Norris, Theodore Dreiser and Upton Sinclair, all socialists whose novels passionately excoriated capitalism's physical and emotional toll on the average man." [...] Even after the McCarthy hearings, he remained a committed opponent of militarism and the Cold War, which he regarded as having been instigated by the United States. He condemned it as [...] "almost worse for art than the real thing". Throw the artist [...] "into a mood of suspicion, ill-will, <b>and</b> <b>dread</b> that typifies the cold war attitude and he'll create nothing".|$|E
