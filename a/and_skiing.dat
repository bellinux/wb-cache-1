5|$|The notch was {{discovered}} in 1784 by Jeremy Belknap, but its isolation prevented further development for several years. The construction of New Hampshire Route 16 has led to increased accessibility and a rise in tourism. Its location makes it a hub for hiking <b>and</b> <b>skiing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Also popular are hikes <b>and</b> <b>skiing</b> in {{the nearby}} Cascade or Olympic Mountains and kayaking and sailing {{in the waters of}} Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the Strait of Georgia.

5|$|Despite {{the nature}} of memorial, the {{surrounding}} hills are a popular summer hiking and winter sledding <b>and</b> <b>skiing</b> location. Although Germany supplies annual funding for memorial maintenance, it is insufficient to fund regular police patrols and surveillance. The memorial and gravestones have been vandalised several times, each time attracting media attention.|$|E

50|$|As {{interest}} in snow sports increased, Geiger's increased its involvement, adding items like alpine <b>and</b> Nordic <b>skis</b> <b>and</b> <b>ski</b> boots, snowboards <b>and</b> boots, <b>ski</b> <b>and</b> snowboard accessories, {{and a significant}} number of brands in men's, women's and children's cold weather clothing and accessories.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s Karhu's {{production}} {{expanded to}} include cross-country <b>and</b> <b>ski</b> jumping skis. During the Winter War and Continuation War, from 1939-1945, Karhu produced snow-camouflage suits, tents <b>and</b> <b>skis</b> for the Finnish military.|$|R
5|$|Ashley-Cooper {{was educated}} at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. As a child, his primary pursuits outside of getting an education, {{included}} mountain climbing <b>and</b> <b>skiing.</b> He also expressed {{a love of}} music, which continued into adulthood with his service {{as chairman of the}} London Philharmonic Orchestra from 1966 to 1980. On 8 March 1947, his father died unexpectedly of a heart disease and Ashley-Cooper became heir to the titles held by his grandfather and acquired the courtesy title of Lord Ashley.|$|E
5|$|The valleys that delimit the massif {{were used}} as {{communication}} routes by the Romans until they left around the 5thcentury AD. The region has remained of some military importance through to the mid-20thcentury. A peasant farming economy operated within these valleys for many centuries until the glaciers and mountains were discovered by the outside world in the 18thcentury. Word of these impressive sights began to spread, and Mont Blanc was finally climbed in 1786, marking {{the start of the}} sport of mountaineering. The region is now a major tourist destination, drawing in over sixmillion visitors per year. It provides a wide range of opportunities for outdoor recreation and activities such as sight-seeing, hiking, rock climbing, mountaineering <b>and</b> <b>skiing.</b> Around one hundred people a year die across its mountains and, occasionally, bodies have been lost and entombed in its glaciers for decades.|$|E
25|$|Guided {{activities}} such as fishing, winter camping, <b>and</b> <b>skiing,</b> are offered throughout the year.|$|E

50|$|The {{biomechanics}} {{of competitive}} cross-country <b>skiing</b> <b>and</b> <b>ski</b> jumping {{have been the}} subject of serious study. Cross-country <b>skiing</b> requires strength <b>and</b> endurance <b>and</b> <b>ski</b> jumping requires aerodynamic efficiency, both of which requirements translate into specific skills to be optimized in training and competition.|$|R

25|$|The service cabins {{are also}} open {{during the winter}} season, {{although}} they are sometimes only self-serviced off season. Ski trails are marked and sometimes prepared, either by DNT {{or some of the}} hotels <b>and</b> <b>skiing</b> resorts close to the park.|$|E
40|$|The yeast superkiller (SKI) genes were {{originally}} identified from mutations allowing increased production of killer toxin encoded by M "killer" virus, a satellite of the dsRNA virus L-A. XRN 1 (SKI 1) encodes a cytoplasmic 5 '-exoribonuclease {{responsible for the}} majority of cytoplasmic RNA turnover, whereas SKI 2, <b>SKI</b> 3, <b>and</b> <b>SKI</b> 8 are required for normal 3 '-degradation of mRNA and for repression of translation of poly(A) minus RNA. Ski 2 p is a putative RNA helicase, Ski 3 p is a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein, <b>and</b> <b>Ski</b> 8 p contains five WD- 40 (beta-transducin) repeats. An xrn 1 mutation in combination with a ski 2, ski 3, or ski 8 mutation is lethal, suggesting redundancy of function. Using functional epitope-tagged Ski 2, <b>Ski</b> 3, <b>and</b> <b>Ski</b> 8 proteins, we show that Ski 2 p, <b>Ski</b> 3 p, <b>and</b> <b>Ski</b> 8 p can be coimmunoprecipitated as an apparent heterotrimeric complex. With epitope-tagged Ski 2 p, there was a 1 : 1 : 1 stoichiometry of the proteins in the complex. Ski 2 p did not associate with Ski 3 p in the absence of Ski 8 p, nor did Ski 2 p associate with Ski 8 p in the absence of Ski 3 p. However, the Ski 3 p/Ski 8 p interaction did not require Ski 2 p. In addition, ski 6 - 2 or ski 4 - 1 mutations or deletion of SKI 7 did not affect complex formation. The identification of a complex composed of Ski 2 p, <b>Ski</b> 3 p, <b>and</b> <b>Ski</b> 8 p explains previous results showing phenotypic similarity between mutations in SKI 2, <b>SKI</b> 3, <b>and</b> <b>SKI</b> 8. Indirect immunofluorescence of <b>Ski</b> 3 p <b>and</b> subcellular fractionation of <b>Ski</b> 2 p <b>and</b> <b>Ski</b> 3 p suggest that <b>Ski</b> 2 p <b>and</b> <b>Ski</b> 3 p are cytoplasmic. These data support the idea that Ski 2 p, <b>Ski</b> 3 p, <b>and</b> <b>Ski</b> 8 p function in the cytoplasm in a 3 '-mRNA degradation pathway...|$|R
