Moraes, Viso and Sato {{finished}} in positions seven to nine, while Castroneves was demoted to tenth. There were four cautions and four lead changes <b>among</b> <b>three</b> different drivers during the race. It was Dixon's second win of the season, and the twenty-third of his career.|$|E

5|$|Adams and {{the lands}} {{surrounding}} it were initially set aside {{as part of}} the Mount Rainier Forest Reserve under the Department of the Interior in 1897. Eight years later, in 1905, the Bureau of Forestry, later the Forest Service, was created under the Department of Agriculture and all the Forest Reserves were transferred to the new agency. In 1907, the Forest Reserves were renamed to National Forests and in 1908, the Rainier National Forest was divided <b>among</b> <b>three</b> Forests. The southern half became the Columbia National Forest. The name was changed in 1949 to honor the first Chief of the Forest, Gifford Pinchot. In 1964, the lands around Mount Adams were set aside as a wilderness.|$|E
5|$|As a {{professional}} wrestling championship, {{the title was}} won via a scripted ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline. The inaugural champion was Brock Lesnar, who was the reigning IWGP Heavyweight Champion before being stripped of the title due to issues with NJPW. IGF recognized him as the official IWGP Heavyweight Champion afterwards. All title changes occurred at IGF or NJPW-promoted events. There were {{a total of three}} reigns <b>among</b> <b>three</b> wrestlers during the title's brief history before being unified with the IWGP Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

5|$|Davies' script {{takes place}} in two {{distinct}} time frames and required two different actors for the eponymous role: the older Casanova was portrayed by Peter O'Toole, and the younger Casanova was portrayed by David Tennant. The serial takes place primarily during Casanova's early adulthood and depicts his life <b>among</b> <b>three</b> women: his mother (Dervla Kirwan), his lover Henriette (Laura Fraser), and his consort Bellino (Nina Sosanya). The script takes {{a different approach to}} Dennis Potter's 1971 dramatisation; instead of Potter's focus on sex and misogyny, the 2005 serial focuses on Casanova's compassion and respect for women.|$|E

Eleven countries have only a single site each. Four sites are shared between two countries: Maloti-Drakensberg Park (Lesotho and South Africa), the Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve (Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea), the Stone Circles of Senegambia (the Gambia and Senegal), and the Mosi-oa-Tunya / Victoria Falls (Zambia and Zimbabwe). Two sites are shared <b>among</b> <b>three</b> countries, Sangha Trinational (Central African Republic, Cameroon, and Congo) and W-Arly-Penjari Complex (Benin, Burkina Faso, and Niger).|$|E
5|$|In 1888, von Zittel divided stegocephalians <b>among</b> <b>three</b> taxa: Lepospondyli, Temnospondyli, and Stereospondyli. He placed microsaurs in Lepospondyli, a {{group which}} he {{characterized}} as having simple, spool-shaped vertebral centra. Temnospondyli included forms with the centra divided into pleurocentra and intercentra. All members of Stereospondyli had amphicoelous centra composed {{only of the}} intercentra. Cope objected to von Zittel's classification, considering the vertebrae of lepospondyls and stereospondyls indistinguishable because each had a simple spool shape. He continued to use Ganocephala and Labyrinthodonta (which he alternatively referred to as Rhachitomi) to distinguish animals based on the absence or presence of occipital condyles.|$|E

5|$|Outlaw Star was {{serialized}} in Japan's monthly Shueisha magazine Ultra Jump between 1996 and 1999. A {{total of}} 21 chapters were published, and 17 of these chapters were compiled <b>among</b> <b>three</b> tankōbon (collected volumes), released in Japan from August 1997 to January 1999. Each volume also contains {{information on the}} series' universe; detailed spaceship and planet descriptions; and character profiles. A Chinese version of the manga was published in Hong Kong by Sharp Point Press. The series has also been published in German and Italian by Planet Manga. No official English translation of the Outlaw Star exists, though Morning Star Studio's official website suggests that a release in the United States was planned at one time.|$|E
5|$|Rumours {{garnered}} widespread critical acclaim. Praise {{centred on}} its production quality and harmonies, which frequently {{relied on the}} interplay <b>among</b> <b>three</b> vocalists. The record has inspired the work of musical acts in different genres. Often considered Fleetwood Mac's best release, it has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1970s and the best albums of all time. In 2004, Rumours was remastered and reissued {{with the addition of}} an extra track and a bonus CD of outtakes from the recording sessions. A three-CD reissue of the album was released by Warner Bros. on 29 January 2013. The set included outtakes of songs and concert tracks the band played while on tour in 1977.|$|E

5|$|The Song {{military}} was chiefly organized {{to ensure that}} the army could not threaten Imperial control, often at the expense of effectiveness in war. Northern Song's Military Council operated under a Chancellor, who had no control over the imperial army. The imperial army was divided <b>among</b> <b>three</b> marshals, each independently responsible to the Emperor. Since the Emperor rarely led campaigns personally, Song forces lacked unity of command. The imperial court often believed that successful generals endangered royal authority, and relieved or even executed them (notably Li Gang, Yue Fei, and Han Shizhong).|$|E

5|$|Tyler's {{successor}} in the Senate was William Cabell Rives, {{a conservative}} Democrat. In February 1839, the General Assembly considered who should fill that seat, {{which was to}} expire the following month. Rives had drifted away from his party, signalling a possible alliance with the Whigs. As Tyler had already fully rejected the Democrats, he expected the Whigs would support him. Still, many Whigs found Rives a more politically expedient choice, as they hoped to ally with the conservative wing of the Democratic Party in the 1840 presidential election. This strategy was supported by Whig leader Henry Clay, who nevertheless admired Tyler at that time. With the vote split <b>among</b> <b>three</b> candidates, including Rives and Tyler, the Senate seat remained vacant for almost two years, until January 1841.|$|E
