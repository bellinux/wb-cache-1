50|$|<b>Aliskiren</b> is {{effective}} in lowering blood pressure, but as of 20 April 2012 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning of possible risks when using <b>aliskiren</b> or blood pressure medicines containing <b>aliskiren</b> with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with diabetes or kidney (renal) impairment. They advised that such drug combinations {{should not be used}} in patients with diabetes because of the risk of causing renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia and that <b>aliskiren</b> should not be used with ARBs or ACE inhibitors in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (i.e., where glomerular filtration rate GFR < 60 mL/min). However, they also recommend that patients should not stop taking <b>aliskiren</b> without talking to a healthcare professional.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aliskiren,</b> {{the only}} renin {{inhibitor}} {{to go into}} phase III clinical trials, is not structurally related to peptides, {{which makes it a}} third-generation renin inhibitor. The first clinical trial was performed in 2000 in healthy volunteers. In 2007, <b>aliskiren</b> was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency as a treatment for hypertension. A systematic review by the Cochrane Hypertension group found the maximum recommended dose of <b>aliskiren</b> produced an appreciable decline in blood pressure over placebo.|$|E

5000|$|Example of binding to the renin {{inhibitor}}: <b>Aliskiren</b> is a peptide-like renin inhibitor and, unlike most, it {{is rather}} hydrophilic. It blocks the catalytic function of the enzyme by occupying the S3 to S2′ pockets, except the S2 pocket. <b>Aliskiren</b> also binds to the S3sp subpocket and because that pocket is distinct for renin, <b>aliskiren</b> does not inhibit other aspartic proteases, such as cathepsin D and pepsin.The side chain of <b>aliskiren</b> binds the S3sp subpocket ideally, and leads to its quality as an inhibitor of human renin.The hydroxyl group in <b>aliskiren</b> forms a hydrogen bond with both oxygen atoms of the Asp32. The amine group forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxylic acid group of Gly217 and the oxygen atom of the Asp32. The methoxy group on the aromatic ring fills the S3 pocket and may possibly form a hydrogen bond with a secondary amine group of Tyr14. The amide group forms a hydrogen bond with a secondary amine group of Ser76. [...] The S1 and S1′ pockets are occupied by the two propyl groups in positions P1 and P1′. The terminal amide in position P2′ anchors the amide tail in the active site by forming a hydrogen bond with Arg74 in the S2′ pocket.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aliskiren</b> in {{combination}} with hydrochlorothiazide {{was approved by the}} FDA in 2008 under the tradename Tekturna HCT.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{possible}} interaction with ciclosporin, {{the use of}} ciclosporin and <b>aliskiren</b> {{at the same time}} is contraindicated.|$|E
5000|$|Direct renin inhibitors {{can also}} be used for hypertension. The drugs that inhibit renin are <b>aliskiren</b> and the investigational remikiren.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Aliskiren</b> {{has been}} shown to {{increase}} the likelihood of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes and kidney or heart disease.|$|E
5000|$|Caution {{should be}} {{exercised}} when <b>aliskiren</b> is administered with ketoconazole or other moderate P-glycoprotein inhibitors (itraconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, or amiodarone).|$|E
50|$|Treatment with {{lisinopril}} {{should be}} avoided {{for people who have}} a history of angioedema (hereditary or idiopathic) or who have diabetes and are taking <b>aliskiren.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Kumada {{coupling}} {{is suitable}} for large-scale, industrial processes, such as drug synthesis. The reaction is used to construct the carbon skeleton of <b>aliskiren</b> (trade name Tekturna), a treatment for hypertension.|$|E
5000|$|A {{warning to}} avoid use of <b>aliskiren</b> with ARBs or ACEIs was also added for {{patients}} with moderate to severe kidney impairment (i.e., where glomerular filtration rate is less than 60 ml/min).|$|E
50|$|<b>Aliskiren,</b> an orally active non-peptide renin inhibitor, was {{the first}} drug in its class on the market. It is used to treat {{hypertension}} as monotherapy or {{in combination with other}} antihypertensive agents. The key to the discovery of <b>aliskiren</b> was crystallography and molecular modeling techniques. Now, a solution has been found to the problem that impeded the development of the renin inhibitors of the previous generations. Non-peptide substances were known to be able to solve the problems of poor pharmacokinetic properties and low specificity. This led to the design of small molecules, non-peptide inhibitors, which were very potent and specific of human renin.|$|E
50|$|While {{used for}} high blood pressure, other better studied {{medications}} are typically recommended. Prescrire {{has stated that}} <b>aliskiren</b> is potentially more harmful than beneficial and thus list it as of 2014 as a drug to avoid.|$|E
50|$|The {{packaging}} for valsartan {{includes a}} warning stating the drug {{should not be}} used with the renin inhibitor <b>aliskiren</b> in people with diabetes mellitus. It also states the drug {{should not be used}} in people with kidney disease.|$|E
50|$|Amlodipine and {{valsartan}} is {{a combination}} drugs for hypertension. The combination is not approved for use by anyone younger than 18 years old. For who have diabetes or kidney disease the combination drugs cannot be given with medication that contains <b>aliskiren.</b>|$|E
50|$|Azilsartan {{must not}} be used with <b>aliskiren,</b> a renin inhibitor, in {{patients}} with diabetes as this increases the risk of serious adverse effects. Like other antihypertensive drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system, it is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|Renin comes {{one level}} higher than {{angiotensin}} converting enzyme (ACE) in the renin-angiotensin system. Inhibitors of renin can therefore effectively reduce hyptertension. <b>Aliskiren</b> (developed by Novartis) is a renin inhibitor which has {{been approved by the}} U.S. FDA for the treatment of hypertension.|$|E
50|$|The drug {{combination}} aliskiren/amlodipine (INNs, trade name Tekamlo) is an antihypertensive. Clinical trials have shown {{it to be}} more effective than amlodipine on its own, with a high dosing regime (<b>aliskiren</b> 300 mg/amlodipine 10 mg) being more effective than olmesartan/amlodipine with comparable tolerability.|$|E
5000|$|A new {{contraindication}} {{was added}} to the product label concerning the use of <b>aliskiren</b> with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in patients with diabetes because of the risk of kidney impairment, low blood pressure, and high levels of potassium in the blood.|$|E
50|$|Many drugs control blood {{pressure}} by interfering with angiotensin or aldosterone. However, when these drugs are used chronically, the body increases renin production, which drives {{blood pressure}} up again. Therefore, pharmacologists {{have been looking}} for a drug to inhibit renin directly. <b>Aliskiren</b> is the first drug to do so.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aliskiren</b> (trade names Tekturna and Rasilez) is {{the first}} in a class of drugs called direct renin inhibitors. It is used for {{essential}} (primary) hypertension. While used for high blood pressure, other better studied medications are typically recommended due to concerns of higher side effects and less evidence of benefit.|$|E
50|$|Amlodipine/aliskiren or {{amlodipine}}/aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide if amlodipine alone cannot reduce blood pressure. <b>Aliskiren</b> is a renin inhibitor, {{which works}} to reduce primary hypertension (that with no known cause) by binding to renin and preventing it from initiating the renin-angiotensin system (RAAS) pathway to increase blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and decreases overall blood volume.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} is notable for {{being among the}} first reported catalytic cross-coupling methods. Despite the subsequent development of alternative reactions (Suzuki, Sonogashira, Stille, Hiyama, Negishi), the Kumada coupling continues to be employed in many synthetic applications, including the industrial-scale production of <b>aliskiren,</b> a hypertension medication, and polythiophenes, useful in organic electronic devices.|$|E
5000|$|Renin, {{the first}} enzyme in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, {{plays a role}} in blood {{pressure}} control. It cleaves angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is in turn converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II has both direct and indirect effects on blood pressure. It directly causes arterial smooth muscle to contract, leading to vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the production of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which causes the tubules of the kidneys to increase reabsorption of sodium, with water following, thereby increasing plasma volume, and thus blood pressure. <b>Aliskiren</b> binds to the S3bp binding site of renin, essential for its activity. [...] Binding to this pocket prevents the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I.Aliskiren is also available as combination therapy with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
50|$|These drugs {{inhibit the}} first and rate-limiting step of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), namely the {{conversion}} of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. This leads to a totality in absence of Angiotensin II based on the rationale that renin only acts to inhibit this step unlike Angiotensin Converting Enzyme which is also involved in other biochemical reactions. Since the 1970s, scientists {{have been trying to}} develop potent inhibitors with acceptable oral bioavailability. The process was difficult and took about three decades. The first and second generations faced problems such as poor bioavailability and lack of potency. Finally, the third generation was discovered. These compounds were nonpeptidic renin inhibitors, had acceptable oral bioavailability and were potent enough for clinical use. The first drug in this class was <b>aliskiren,</b> which received a marketing approval in 2007. , it is the only renin inhibitor on the market.|$|E
40|$|<b>Aliskiren</b> is {{a direct}} renin {{inhibitor}} developed to treat hypertension. Several clinical {{studies have suggested that}} <b>aliskiren</b> has beneficial effects on cardiovascular diseases beyond its antihypertensive effect. In the present study, we examined whether <b>aliskiren</b> limits the progression of AAA (abdominal aortic aneurysm), VH (ventricular hypertrophy) and atherosclerosis in an AngII (angiotensin II) -infused mouse model. ApoE-/- (apolipoprotein-E-deficient) mice were infused subcutaneously with AngII (1000 ng/kg of body weight per day; 4 weeks) to induce AAA and VH. At the completion of the AngII infusion, mice were randomly allocated to three groups to receive vehicle control, low-dose <b>aliskiren</b> (10 mg/kg of body weight per day) or high-dose <b>aliskiren</b> (50 mg/kg of body weight per day) for 4 weeks. Suprarenal aortic diameter assessed by ultrasound was significantly smaller in mice administered <b>aliskiren</b> at days 42 and 56. <b>Aliskiren</b> also significantly reduced the normalized heart weight, ventricular myocyte cell width and aortic arch atherosclerosis. <b>Aliskiren</b> lowered PRR (pro-renin receptor) expression and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) activity in the suprarenal aorta and heart. Aortic infiltration of T-lymphocytes and macrophages was reduced by <b>aliskiren.</b> In conclusion, <b>aliskiren</b> limits the progression of AAA, VH and atherosclerosis in an AngII-infused mouse model...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the effects of the renin {{inhibitor}} <b>aliskiren</b> in streptozotocin-diabetic TG(mRen- 2) 27 rats. Furthermore, we investigated in vitro the effect of <b>aliskiren</b> on the interactions between renin and the (pro) renin receptor and between <b>aliskiren</b> and prorenin. <b>Aliskiren</b> distributed extensively to the kidneys of normotensive (non) diabetic rats, localizing in the glomeruli and vessel walls after 2 hours exposure. In diabetic TG(mRen- 2) 27 rats, <b>aliskiren</b> (10 or 30 mg/kg per day, 10 weeks) lowered blood pressure, prevented albuminuria, and suppressed renal transforming growth factor-β and collagen I expression versus vehicle. <b>Aliskiren</b> reduced (pro) renin receptor expression in glomeruli, tubules, and cortical vessels compared to vehicle (in situ hybridization). In human mesangial cells, <b>aliskiren</b> (0. 1 μmol/L to 10 μmol/L) did not inhibit binding of I-renin to the (pro) renin receptor, nor did it alter the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 by renin (20 nmol/L) preincubated with <b>aliskiren</b> (100 nmol/L) or affect gene expression of the (pro) renin receptor. Evidence was obtained that <b>aliskiren</b> binds to the active site of prorenin. The above results demonstrate the antihypertensive and renoprotective effects of <b>aliskiren</b> in experimental diabetic nephropathy. The evidence that <b>aliskiren</b> can reduce in vivo gene expression for the (pro) renin receptor and that it may block prorenin-induced angiotensin generation supports the need for additional work to reveal the mechanism of the observed renoprotection by this renin inhibitor...|$|E
40|$|Roberto Fogari, Annalisa ZoppiDepartment of Internal Medicine and Therapeutics, University of Pavia, ItalyAbstract: <b>Aliskiren,</b> {{the first}} orally active direct renin inhibitor, is an {{effective}} antihypertensive drug with distinctive characteristics, including good blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, a prolonged duration of action, pharmacologic effects that persist after drug discontinuation, and favorable tolerability comparable with placebo.
