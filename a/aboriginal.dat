5|$|<b>Aboriginal</b> {{versions}} of the story also exist. In 1987, an elderly <b>Aboriginal</b> man from nearby Kingston related {{a version of the}} story, in which Brown shot some <b>Aboriginal</b> people and poisoned others because they were stealing his sheep. Brown then established his alibi by riding to Adelaide. In the same year Hastings' account was reproduced verbatim in Tom McCourt and Hans Mincham's The Coorong and Lakes of the Lower Murray. Three years later, the South Australian Education Department published an <b>Aboriginal</b> studies book for secondary students. It repeated Hastings' version, and followed it with an <b>Aboriginal</b> version told by a Ngarrindjeri man, George Trevorrow, whose family were from the Guichen Bay area. Trevorrow described the exploitation of <b>Aboriginal</b> workers by white settlers, and stated that when times were lean, <b>Aboriginal</b> people would steal flour from landowners. He did not name Brown, but stated that a settler poisoned some flour and rode for Adelaide to establish an alibi. Foster et al. note that while these two accounts were similar, the difference was that Hastings portrayed Brown as a victim of <b>Aboriginal</b> attacks, while Trevorrow emphasised white exploitation of <b>Aboriginal</b> people.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 Chatwin {{returned}} {{to the topic of}} nomads and decided to focus on <b>Aboriginal</b> Australians. He was influenced by the work of Theodore Strehlow, author of Songs of Central Australia and a controversial figure.

5|$|In {{common with}} {{other areas of}} South Australia, and Australia as a whole, {{settlers}} on the frontier employed various tactics to deal with <b>Aboriginal</b> resistance to being forced off their traditional lands. Initially, these revolved around keeping them at a distance using threats of violence, but they soon escalated to terrorising <b>Aboriginal</b> people to stop them interfering with stock and other property, tactics which sometimes included violent clashes. Violence by settlers towards <b>Aboriginal</b> people often went unreported to the authorities, and became more secretive after a settler was hanged in March 1847 for murdering an <b>Aboriginal</b> man in the south east of the colony, the only such sentence {{in the history of}} South Australia's early white settlement. This frontier violence has been described as an undeclared and covert war between settlers and <b>Aboriginal</b> people.|$|E
5|$|On 27 May 1849, {{stores were}} taken from a hut on Thomas Cooper Horn's station and a hutkeeper and {{shepherd}} were threatened by <b>Aboriginal</b> people, who left with the goods they had taken. The station owner {{and some of his}} station hands pursued the group, and when they caught up with the fleeing party of <b>Aboriginal</b> people shots were fired and spears thrown. The <b>Aboriginal</b> group split in two, and Horn and his men followed one party to the Waterloo Bay cliffs, which the group tried to climb down in order to make their escape. Horn and his men opened fire, and two <b>Aboriginal</b> people were killed and one was fatally wounded, with several more being captured. The Government Resident and the police inspector from Port Lincoln both wrote detailed accounts of the incident, neither of which mentioned a large number of casualties. One specified that only two <b>Aboriginal</b> people were killed. In September, a group of <b>Aboriginal</b> men were transported to Adelaide for trial. Two were convicted of the murder of Beevor, and were transported back to the Elliston district where they were hanged outside his hut. Three were charged with the murder of Easton, but were acquitted due to lack of evidence. A number of others were charged over the confrontation at the hut on Horn's station. Shortly after this, two more <b>Aboriginal</b> men were arrested in Port Lincoln by the police and charged with the murder of Hamp. Found guilty and sentenced to death, they were later released when doubts were raised about the testimony of <b>Aboriginal</b> witnesses located by the police. In February 1852 another <b>Aboriginal</b> male was arrested as an accomplice in Hamp's murder, but after being transported to Adelaide, he too was released due to lack of evidence. He tried to walk home to his country, and was murdered by four <b>Aboriginal</b> men for trespassing.|$|E

50|$|On 26 June 1861, Thomas Petrie {{appeared}} at {{the proceedings of the}} Select Committee on the Native Police Force to give evidence.

He also said that <b>aboriginals</b> were definitely cannibals and that they should be forbidden to go into Brisbane unless they had 'a pass or accompanied by their masters.' He claimed that he paid <b>aboriginals</b> that worked for him in clothing only, as they would otherwise spend money on alcohol and that it was commonplace for <b>aboriginals</b> to be paid for their labour with rum.|$|R

5|$|The Waterloo Bay {{massacre}} or Elliston massacre {{refers to}} a fatal clash between settlers and <b>Aboriginal</b> Australians in late May 1849 on the cliffs of Waterloo Bay near Elliston, South Australia {{which led to the}} deaths of a number of <b>Aboriginal</b> people, and forms part of the Australian frontier wars. The events leading up to the fatal clash included killings of three white settlers by <b>Aboriginal</b> people, and the killing of one <b>Aboriginal</b> person and the death by poisoning of five others by white settlers. The limited archival records indicate that three <b>Aboriginal</b> people were killed or died of wounds from the clash, and five were captured, however, accounts of the killing of up to 260 <b>Aboriginal</b> people at the cliffs have persistently circulated since at least 1880.|$|E

5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{intermarriage}} continued, as many KMT soldiers married <b>aboriginal</b> {{women who were}} from poorer areas and could be easily bought as wives.

In a 1994 study, it was found that 71% of the families surveyed would object to their daughter marrying an <b>aboriginal</b> man. For much of the KMT era the government definition of <b>aboriginal</b> identity had been 100% <b>aboriginal</b> parentage, leaving any intermarriage resulting in a non-aboriginal child. Later the policy was adjusted to the ethnic status of the father determining the status of the child.|$|E

5|$|Archæological {{evidence}} from the Birrigai rock shelter in Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve indicates habitation dating back at least 21,000 years.

Another site of significance in the reserve is the Bogong Rocks shelter, which contains the oldest evidence of <b>Aboriginal</b> occupation at a bogong moth resting site. These insects were an important source of food for the <b>Aboriginal</b> peoples of the Southern Alps and would accumulate by the thousands in caves and rock crevices, where they were collected and later roasted in sand or ashes, and then eaten whole.|$|E

5|$|Chatwin went to Australia {{to learn}} more about <b>Aboriginal</b> culture, {{specifically}} the songlines or dreaming tracks. Each songline is a personal story and functions as a creation tale and a map, and each <b>Aboriginal</b> Australian has their own songline. Chatwin thought the songlines could be a metaphor he could use to support his ideas about humans' need to wander, which he believed was genetic. However, he struggled to fully understand and describe the songlines and their place in <b>Aboriginal</b> culture. This was due to Chatwin's approach to learning about the songlines. He spent several weeks in 1983 and 1984 in Australia, during which he primarily relied on non-Aboriginal people for information. Chatwin was limited by his inability to speak the <b>Aboriginal</b> languages. He interviewed people involved in the Land Rights movement, and he alienated many of them because he was oblivious to the politics and also because he was an admirer of Strehlow's work.|$|E
