50|$|Avis de réception (English: <b>Advice</b> or {{acknowledgment}} <b>of</b> <b>receipt)</b> is {{a postal}} service returning to the sender a form or card signed by the recipient. This {{is evidence that the}} letter was received, and these forms (or cards) are frequently seen with legal endorsements. It had existed under various names in some postal entities as early as the late 18th century, and was adopted by the GPU General Postal Union in 1875, and again by its successor, the UPU Universal Postal Union in 1879.|$|R
50|$|Proof of {{delivery}} (POD) {{is a method}} to establish {{the fact that the}} recipient received the contents sent by the sender. When the sender sends multiple documents through the mail there is a possibility of some not reaching the intended recipient. Generally post offices provide additional service of guaranteed delivery, known as an Avis de réception (<b>advice</b> or acknowledgment <b>of</b> <b>receipt),</b> wherein they require the recipient to sign a paper and that paper is filed by the postal service for a specified number of days.|$|R
40|$|Background: Prevalence {{rates of}} smoking {{in people with}} mental illness are high and {{premature}} mortality attributed to tobacco related physical comorbidity is a major concern. We conducted a meta-analysis comparing rates <b>of</b> <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> smoking cessation <b>advice</b> among people with and without mental illness. Method: Major electronic databases were searched from inception till August 2014 for studies comparing rates <b>of</b> <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> smoking cessation <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> people with and without a mental illness. Two independent authors completed methodological appraisal and extracted data. A random effects meta-analysis was utilized. Results: Seven studies of satisfactory methodological quality (n mental illness = 68, 811, n control = 652, 847) were included. Overall {{there was no significant difference}} in smoking cessation advice rates between those with and without a mental illness (RR = 1. 02, 95...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Management {{of chronic}} {{diseases}} requires patients {{to adhere to}} recommended health behavior change and complete tests for monitoring. While studies have shown an association between low income and lack of adherence, the reasons why people with low income {{may be less likely}} to adhere are unclear. We sought to determine the association between household income and <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> health behavior change advice, adherence to <b>advice,</b> <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> recommended monitoring tests, and self-reported reasons for non-adherence/non-receipt. METHODS: We conducted a population-weighted survey, with 1849 respondents with cardiovascular-related chronic diseases (heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, stroke) from Western Canada (n =  1849). We used log-binomial regression to examine the association between household income and the outcome variables <b>of</b> interest: <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> for and adherence to health behavior change (sodium reduction, dietary improvement, increased physical activity, smoking cessation, weight loss), reasons for non-adherence, <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> recommended monitoring tests (cholesterol, blood glucose, blood pressure), and reasons for non-receipt of tests. RESULTS: Behavior change advice was received equally by both low and high income respondents. Low income respondents were more likely than those with high income to not adhere to recommendations regarding smoking cessation (adjusted prevalence rate ratio (PRR) : 1. 55, 95 %CI: 1. 09 - 2. 20), and more likely to not receive measurements of blood cholesterol (PRR: 1. 72, 95 %CI 1. 24 - 2. 40) or glucose (PRR: 1. 80, 95 %CI: 1. 26 - 2. 58). Those with low income were less likely to state that non-adherence/non-receipt was due to personal choice, and more likely to state that it was due to an extrinsic factor, such as cost or lack of accessibility. CONCLUSIONS: There are important income-related differences in the patterns of health behavior change and disease monitoring, as well as reasons for non-adherence or non-receipt. Among those with low income, adherence to health behavior change and monitoring may be improved by addressing modifiable barriers such as cost and access...|$|R
