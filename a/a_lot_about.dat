5|$|Bullfrog Productions {{developed}} Dungeon Keeper 2 {{with a team}} {{of around}} fifty people. The team included people involved in the original Dungeon Keeper, including Richard Ridings and programmer Alex Peters. Electronic Arts wanted to capitalize on the original game's success. Producer Nick Goldsworthy believed the key to success was carrying over aspects of the original game and adding new things. A project manager from Mitsubishi assisted the team in management of attaining milestones, and according to Goldsworthy, this taught the team <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> the practices employed by major companies regarding game development.|$|E
5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah. I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I know <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is {{to be open to}} everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, the Royal National Theatre {{created a}} stage {{version of the}} book, adapted and {{directed}} by Katie Mitchell. Seussical, a musical adaptation that incorporates aspects of many Dr. Seuss works, features the Cat in the Hat as narrator. The musical received weak reviews when it opened, in November 2001, but eventually became a staple in regional and school theaters. The Cat also stars in the 1982 television film The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat and the 2010 animated television series The Cat in the Hat Knows <b>a</b> <b>Lot</b> <b>About</b> That! A ride at Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure park in Orlando, Florida, is based around The Cat in the Hat.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the first}} game was outsourced to Bowne Global, and was handled by the writer Alexander O. Smith and the editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version takes place in Japan, the localized version {{is set in the}} United States: because one of the episodes involves time zones, they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose the United States without thinking <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> it. The Japanese justice system of the original still remained intact in the localization, as changing it would have altered the entire game structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the game}} was outsourced to a company called Bowne Global, and was handled by writer Alexander O. Smith, who was {{not familiar with the}} Ace Attorney series prior to working on it, and editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version {{of the game}} takes place in Japan, the localized version is set in the United States. They would normally have left the setting vague while adapting cultural differences that the target audience would not understand, but because one of the episodes involves time zones, they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose the United States without thinking <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> it. This became an issue in later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious. All the voice roles in the localized version of the game were handled by localization staff; Takumi had wanted to do the English voice for Phoenix, but it was handled by Ben Judd.|$|E

25|$|While {{creating}} Still Life, Dimitris Papaioannou thought <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> {{the human}} crave for meaning, {{and about the}} absurdity of the human condition, rooted in matter but yearning for spirit.

25|$|According {{to later}} reports, between 1901 and 1903 Scriabin envisioned writing an opera.

Among other things, he would declare: I am the apotheosis of world creation. I am the aim of aims, the end of ends.
