25|$|Once a {{potential}} victim {{has come into}} contact with state authorities, identifying the child as a victim of trafficking takes time. The process often benefits from a thorough understanding of the child’s story. For a child who is in trouble with the law, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers and officers determine if the child is actually a victim of a crime herself, such as exploitation, abuse, or trafficking. For a child in an administrative process, such as an <b>asylum</b> <b>procedure,</b> hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers to detect cases of trafficking. Children may be hesitant to share their complete stories with authorities and appointed child welfare professionals. Some service providers have found that establishing trust and a stable relationship with the child encourages increased disclosure of experiences of exploitation and trafficking that might otherwise not be detected. The trust building process can include granting assistance and support services to ensure safety, well-being and development.|$|E
2500|$|Studies of refugees' {{impact on}} native welfare are scant but the {{existing}} literature shows a positive fiscal impact and mixed results (negative, positive and no significant effects) on native welfare. A 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that refugees to the United States pay [...] "$21,000 more in taxes than they receive in benefits over their first 20 years in the U.S." [...] An internal study by the Department of Health and Human Services under the Trump administration, which was suppressed and not shown to the public, found that refugees to the United States brought in $63 billion more in government revenues than they cost the government. According to labor economist Giovanni Peri, {{the existing literature}} {{suggests that there are}} no economic reasons why the American labor market could not easily absorb 100,000 Syrian refugees in a year. Refugees integrate more slowly into host countries' labor markets than labor migrants, in part due to the loss and depreciation of human capital and credentials during the <b>asylum</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|E

40|$|Adequate {{and fair}} <b>asylum</b> <b>procedures</b> are a {{precondition}} for the effective exercise of rights granted to asylum applicants, in particular the right not be expelled to a country where they face {{the risk of being}} subjected to human rights violations. In 1999 the EU Member States decided to work towards a Common European Asylum System. In this context the Procedures Directive was adopted in 2005. This directive provides for important procedural guarantees for asylum applicants, but also leaves much discretion to the EU Member States to design their <b>asylum</b> <b>procedures.</b> An important result of the adoption of the Procedures Directive is that <b>asylum</b> <b>procedures</b> now fall within the reach of the Charter and general principles of EU law. This book examines the meaning of the EU right to an effective remedy for the legality and the interpretation of the Procedures Directive. For this purpose the EU Courts’ case-law on the EU right to an effective remedy is examined. The interpretation of the EU right to an effective remedy is inspired by international law. Therefore this book also extensively discusses the ECtHR’s case-law as well as the views of the UNHCR and UN Committees concerning procedural rights for asylum applicants. The result of this exercise is a set of procedural standards with regard to several key issues of asylum procedures: the right to remain on the territory of the Member State, the right to be heard, the standard and burden of proof and evidentiary assessment, judicial review of the establishment and qualification of the facts and the use of secret evidence.

50|$|Non-governmental {{organizations}} {{concerned with}} refugees and asylum seekers {{have pointed out}} difficulties for displaced persons to seek asylum in industrialized countries. As their immigration policy often focuses on the fight of illegal immigration and the strengthening of border controls it deters displaced persons from entering territory {{in which they could}} lodge an asylum claim. The lack of opportunities to legally access the <b>asylum</b> <b>procedures</b> can force <b>asylum</b> seekers to undertake often expensive and hazardous attempts at illegal entry.|$|R
40|$|Border {{procedures}} {{have so far}} received little attention in the legal literature dealing with European asylum law. Literature on immigration detention in Europe has also neglected the use of detention in border procedures. This is remarkable {{because one of the}} reasons that Member States resort to border procedures can be traced back to the centrality of territorial presence within the modern State for the enjoyment of rights. The triangular relationship between an application for international protection, refusal of entry, and a deprivation of liberty has remained imprecise. This indeterminacy has had important repercussions for the way in which the right to liberty has been protected at the borders of Europe. However, the way in which the Recast <b>Asylum</b> <b>Procedures</b> Directive circumscribes Member States' use of this procedure is unprecedented. This article uses the Dutch implementation of the <b>Asylum</b> <b>Procedures</b> Directive in order to unpack the above-mentioned triangular relationship between an application for international protection, refusal of entry, and a deprivation of liberty. It will show that European Union regulation in this area is distinctive because it entails recognition of the fact that, when it comes to the enforcement of migration control, individual rights are at stake...|$|R

50|$|In a wider sense, {{the right}} of asylum {{recognises}} the definition of 'refugee' as established in the 1951 Refugee Convention and is understood to protect asylum seekers from deportation and grant them certain protections under the law.

5000|$|Some of the {{criteria}} for which an asylum application can be rejected include: i) Passage via “safe" [...] third country, ii) Safe Country of Origin (An asylum seeker can be a prior refused asylum {{if he or she}} is a national of a country considered to be [...] "safe" [...] by the French asylum authority OFPRA), iii) Safety Threat (serious threat to the public order), or iv) Fraudulent Application (abuse of the <b>asylum</b> <b>procedure</b> for other reasons).|$|E

40|$|Ever {{since the}} the Dublin {{convention}} entered into force in 1997, asylum seekers {{have been given}} a common status in all of Europe: If an asylum application is rejected in one country, the persons right to apply for asylum in other European countries is revoked. For this system to be just, all participating countries would need to have common procedures for their handling of asylum applications: A condition that has repeatedly been proven not to be fulfilled. In order to solve these discrepancies, the European Union has implemented numerous directives and measures intending to harmonise European <b>asylum</b> <b>procedures</b> over the last decades: However, previous studies have found these efforts to be futile, with differences remaining largely the same or even increasing. This thesis sets out to conduct a more thorough study of the convergence of European asylum recognition rates, by seeing the results of quantitative convergence studies in light of the EU policy development process. It finds that the increased discrepancies of asylum recognition rates observed in previous studies are likely {{to be the result of}} unfinished convergence, and concludes that EU directives implemented as a part of the Common European Asylum System are likely to cause a harmonisation of European <b>asylum</b> <b>procedures</b> in the long run. Compared to previous studies, this thesis thus argues for a less pessimistic interpretation of convergence of asylum recognition rates, finding indications that recognition rates are converging following the implementation of EU policies...|$|R
