Aside from the primary mission of sending a living passenger into space, Sputnik 2 also contained instrumentation for measuring solar irradiance and cosmic rays.|$|E
5|$|Following the turnover, the Tar Heels had a {{first down}} at their 32-yard line. Linton was stopped for no gain on a rushing play, passed for no gain, then {{completed}} a nine-yard pass to Brown. Failing to gain the first down, the Tar Heels punted and the ball was returned to the 30-yard line. Oxendine gained two yards on <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> up the right side, then Sorensen ran for one yard {{on the left side}} of the field. On third down, Sorensen scrambled for {{a first down}} before fumbling the football. The loose ball was picked up by Tech lineman Derek Smith, and the Hokies' drive continued. After <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> for no gain, another running play resulted in a Tech fumble, their second of the drive. Unlike the previous fumble, however, this one was recovered by North Carolina's Russell Davis, and the Tar Heels offense was put into position for another scoring attempt.|$|E

5|$|Jaekle {{kicked off}} to the Maryland 30-yard line where it was {{returned}} by Green for two yards. A fresh Da'Rel Scott then made his first appearance in the game. He carried the ball four times in succession {{to advance to the}} Nevada 46-yard line. On third down with nine yards to go, Turner was sacked by defensive lineman Kevin Basped and the ball was knocked loose. It was picked up by Wolf Pack linebacker Brandon Marshall who then also fumbled. Maryland offensive lineman Scott Burley recovered it on the Nevada 45-yard line. The alternating changes in possession gave Maryland a first down, and Turner then connected with Darrius Heyward-Bey on an 11-yard pass for another first down. Scott rushed twice to pick up a first down at the Nevada 23-yard line. After <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> by Meggett, Turner was sacked by defensive end Dontay Moch and again fumbled. This time, Nevada recovered the ball and retained possession. Kaepernick then passed to wide receiver Mike McCoy for 38yards to the Maryland 27-yard line. Vai Taua picked up seven yards on <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> attempt, and the quarter came to an end with Maryland leading, 28–21.|$|E

5|$|The first deep-level tube railway, the City & South London Railway (C), {{opened in}} 1890.

5|$|In January 1990, Gassée {{resigned}} and his authority over product development was divided among several successors. Many Apple engineers {{had long been}} pressing for lower-cost options {{in order to build}} market share and increase demand across the entire price spectrum. With Gassée out, <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> started to quickly introduce a series of low-cost machines. Three market points were identified, a very low-cost machine aimed at costing $1,000, a low-cost machine with color graphics, and a more upscale color machine for small business use. In time, these would develop as the Classic, Macintosh LC, and Macintosh IIsi. Unlike the '020 and '030 based models, the Macintosh Classic has the original Macintosh startup sound.|$|E

5|$|Tech {{received}} Florida State's kickoff at {{its goal}} line {{and returned the}} ball to the 11-yard line, where Tech's offense took over. Kendrick ran for 12yards and a first down, but then Vick fumbled on <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> to the left. Florida State recovered the ball, and the Seminoles' offense was given the ball at the Virginia Tech 35-yard line. On the first play after the fumble, Chaney broke free for a long run that gave State a first down inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. The Seminoles were pushed backward on two consecutive plays and committed a chop block before Bowden was forced to send in Janikowski to kick a 32-yard field goal. The kick gave Florida State a 3929 lead with 10:26 remaining in the game.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>rushed</b> behind {{typically}} {{occurs when}} a defending player touches the ball {{after it has been}} kicked and as it heads toward the goal; by touching the ball, the defender ensures that the attacking team scores only one point, rather than the full six.

5|$|The Germans {{became aware}} of their losses to night fighters, and began <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> program to {{introduce}} a new radar operating on different frequencies. This led to the lower-VHF band FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2, which began to reach operational units in small numbers between August and October 1943, with about 50 units in use by November. In February 1944, No. 80 Sqn noticed a marked decrease in FuG 202 transmissions. By this time the Germans had produced 200 SN-2 sets, and this had reached 1,000 by May. This set deliberately selected a frequency close to that of their ground-based Freya radar sets, {{in the hopes that}} these sources would swamp any wide-band receiver set used on RAF aircraft. Early Serrate units were effectively useless by June 1944, and their replacements were never as successful.|$|E

The Squaw Valley Olympics was the first winter Olympics to have a dedicated athletes' village, {{the first to use}} a computer (courtesy of IBM) to tabulate results, and the first to feature female speed skating events.
