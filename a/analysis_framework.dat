2500|$|Weighted {{correlation}} network analysis, {{also known}} as weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), is a widely used data mining method especially [...] for studying [...] biological networks based on pairwise [...] correlations between variables. While it {{can be applied to}} most [...] high-dimensional data sets, it has been most widely used in [...] genomic applications. [...] It allows one to define modules (clusters), intramodular hubs, and network nodes with regard to module membership, to study the relationships between co-expression modules, and to compare the network topology of different networks (differential network analysis). WGCNA can be used as [...] data reduction technique (related to oblique [...] factor analysis [...] ), as [...] clustering method (fuzzy clustering), as [...] feature selection method (e.g. as gene screening method), as framework for integrating complementary (genomic) data (based on weighted correlations between quantitative variables), and as [...] data exploratory technique. Although WGCNA incorporates traditional data exploratory techniques, its intuitive network language and <b>analysis</b> <b>framework</b> transcend any standard analysis technique. [...] Since it uses network methodology and is well suited for integrating complementary genomic data sets, it can be interpreted as systems biologic or systems genetic data analysis method. By selecting intramodular hubs in consensus modules, WGCNA also gives rise to network based [...] meta analysis techniques ...|$|E

The objective was to identify {{the extent to which}} these frameworks take account of the setting where the ulcer originated as being the person's home rather than a hospital setting. Background: Pressure ulcers involving full-thickness skin loss are increasingly being regarded as indicators of nursing patient safety failure, requiring investigation using root cause <b>analysis</b> <b>frameworks.</b> Evidence suggests that root cause <b>analysis</b> <b>frameworks</b> developed in hospital settings ignore the unique dimensions of risk in home healthcare settings. Design and methods: A systematic literature review and documentary <b>analysis</b> of <b>frameworks</b> used to investigate community-acquired grade three and four pressure ulcers by home nursing services in England. Results: No published papers were identified for inclusion in the review. Fifteen patient safety investigative frameworks were collected and analysed. Twelve of the retrieved frameworks were intended for the investigation of community-acquired pressure ulcers; seven of which took account of the setting where the ulcer originated as being the patient's home. Conclusion: This study provides evidence to suggest that many of the root cause <b>analysis</b> <b>frameworks</b> used to investigate community-acquired pressure ulcers in England are unsuitable for this purpose. Relevance to clinical practice: This study provides researchers and practitioners with evidence of the need to develop appropriate home nursing root cause <b>analysis</b> <b>frameworks</b> to investigate community-acquired pressure ulcers...|$|R

40|$|Reputation systems {{make the}} users of a {{distributed}} application {{accountable for their}} behavior. The reputation of a user is computed as an aggregate of the feedback provided by other users in the system. Truthful feedback is clearly a prerequisite for computing a reputation score that accurately represents {{the behavior of a}} user. However, it has been observed that users often hesitate in providing truthful feedback, mainly due to the fear of retaliation. Privacy preserving reputation systems enable users to provide feedback in a private and thus uninhibited manner. In this paper, we describe <b>analysis</b> <b>frameworks</b> for reputation systems and privacy preserving reputation systems. We use these <b>analysis</b> <b>frameworks</b> to review and compare the existing privacy preserving reputation systems in the literature.

The <b>analysis</b> <b>frameworks</b> are based on fixpoint semantics, i. e. a set of semantic equations is set up and solved using fixpoint iteration techniques.
