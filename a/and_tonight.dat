500|$|In the 1996 NBA Playoffs, Rodman scored 7.5points {{and grabbed}} 13.7rebounds {{per game and}} had a large part in the six-game victory against the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1996 NBA Finals: in Game Two {{at home in the}} Bulls' United Center, he grabbed 20rebounds, among them a record-tying 11offensive boards, and in Game Six, again at the United Center, the power forward secured 19rebounds and again 11offensive boards, scored five points in a decisive 12–2 Bulls run, unnerved {{opposing}} power forward Shawn Kemp and caused Seattle coach George Karl to say: [...] "As you evaluate the series, Dennis Rodman won two basketball games. We controlled Dennis Rodman for four games. But Game 2 <b>and</b> <b>tonight,</b> he was the reason they were successful." [...] His two games with 11offensive rebounds each tied the NBA Finals record of Elvin Hayes.|$|E
500|$|Robert Bianco for USA Today noted {{after the}} episode [...] "Showmance": [...] "Jessalyn Gilsig's self-centered, ridiculously strident Terri {{just needs to}} go, period." [...] Shawna Malcom for the Los Angeles Times deemed Terri [...] "beyond annoying" [...] in the {{following}} episode, [...] "Acafellas", but wrote: [...] "I have confidence that creator Ryan Murphy will flesh out Jessalyn Gilsig’s character over time. Her seemingly sincere apology to Will for not being more supportive of his boy band was a nice first step." [...] Eric Goldman for IGN commented after the episode [...] "Preggers": [...] "So far, Terri has been an incredibly unlikable character. More firmly establishing her as this devilish type of schemer at least pushes her far {{enough to make her}} actions entertaining, even as we root against her." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly noted of the episode [...] "Throwdown": [...] "the pregnancy subplot is dragging down the show, <b>and</b> <b>tonight</b> that subplot nearly derailed an otherwise-excellent episode. Terri's fake pregnancy and Quinn’s real one started out a few weeks ago as an interesting way to insert some realism and tension into a delightfully surreal musical-comedy universe. By now, however, I watch Glee and feel sorry for Jessalyn Gilsig. I’ll bet the actress didn’t initially sign on to have her character Terri become a shrill, lying nag whose main function is to bring husband Will — and by extension, us — down." ...|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{released}} {{three more}} albums– David Bowie (1969), The Man Who Sold the World (1970) and Hunky Dory (1971)– before he eventually made {{it on to}} the UK Albums Chart with The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), which peaked at number five. Following the success of Ziggy Stardust, sales of Hunky Dory improved and it eventually peaked at number three in the UK. RCA re-released the 1969 David Bowie [...] under the title Space Oddity (with an updated Ziggy Stardust-era photo) and The Man Who Sold the World, which reached numbers 17 and 26 in the UK respectively. Bowie released nine more studio albums with RCA, all of which reached the top five of the UK Albums Chart, of which Aladdin Sane (1973), Pin Ups (1973), Diamond Dogs (1974) and Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps) (1980) reached the number one position. He then released three solo studio albums with EMI– Let's Dance (1983), whose title track became his first single to reach number one in both the United Kingdom and the United States, Tonight (1984) and Never Let Me Down (1987). Let's Dance <b>and</b> <b>Tonight</b> reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, while Never Let Me Down reached number six.

500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, {{the pilot was}} viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Diana Steenbergen of IGN, who was [...] "hooked right away", gave the pilot episode a score of 8.5 out of 10. She felt it began [...] "heartbreakingly", and the [...] "genuinely scary" [...] death scenes of Mary and Jess [...] "will haunt...the viewers". Steenbergen praised both the writers and the lead actors for making the [...] " [...] still feel natural, for the most part", and noted Ackles and Padalecki were [...] "instantly convincing as brothers". Also credited for this [...] "well paced" [...] episode was director David Nutter, who did an [...] "excellent job of setting up the atmosphere and tone of the series". Likewise, BuddyTV's Don Williams posited, [...] "It's {{about as good as}} a pilot can get." [...] He ranked it ninth out of his favorite episodes of the first three seasons, believing it introduces the characters [...] "in a memorable fashion" [...] and [...] "wonderfully" [...] establishes the show's universe. Robert Bianco of USA Today deemed the series as possibly [...] "the simplest and the scariest" [...] of the season's new dark shows, and wrote, [...] "It wants nothing more than to frighten you — <b>and</b> <b>tonight,</b> it does." [...] He noted the episode [...] " [...] off a few surprises" [...] and [...] "works its way to an ending that lives up to Dean's 'no chick-flick moments'". However, Bianco criticized the [...] "pauses for comic relief"; he felt Ackles' [...] "comic touch" [...] was [...] "not yet as skillful as it needs to be", with Ackles' attempts at being [...] "humorously annoying" [...] leaving him [...] "simply annoying". Despite the episode having a somewhat unoriginal villain and a [...] "relatively simple" [...] solution, Brian Lowry of Variety deemed the series' debut as [...] "a promising plunge into the darkness". Lowry applauded Ackles, who [...] "brings an easygoing charm and engaging wise-ass personality to the absurd notion of traveling the country with a trunk full of wooden stakes and holy water".|$|E

[...] (40 days and nights was the length of the Biblical Great Flood.) Jones responded, [...] "Mr. Gillen, that is an interesting coincidence, but it was not by design." [...] This humorous exchange provided the title for Matthew Chapman's book about the trial, 40 Days and 40 Nights.|$|E
2500|$|Rallies {{in support}} of O'Brien were {{organized}} outside NBC studios across the United States, notably in Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, and New York City. O'Brien briefly appeared at a January 18 rally outside the Tonight Show studio, after which he gave the crowd free pizza. The show's announcer Andy Richter and drummer Max Weinberg also made an appearance during the rally {{to speak to the}} crowd from atop the Tonight Show studio, <b>and</b> <b>Tonight</b> Show Band trombonist Richie [...] "La Bamba" [...] Rosenberg was driven around the crowd in a Popemobile-style vehicle. American Red Cross representatives were at a number of the rallies to collect money for the Haiti earthquake relief.|$|E
2500|$|Following Weinberg's exit, O'Brien {{sought to}} revamp the show's title theme song. In an {{interview}} with New York Magazine, O'Brien expressed his desire {{to create a new}} introduction from the previous Late Night <b>and</b> <b>Tonight</b> compositions, which were used for O'Brien's entire 17-year relationship with NBC, and ultimately unveil a new signature sound for the show. The new theme song was co-written by bandleader Jimmy Vivino, and O'Brien himself. Despite no obvious copyright issues to continue using the previous theme, which was written by Howard Shore and John Lurie, O'Brien stated of the transition to a new composition, [...] "it just felt like {{the right thing to do}} [...] There's this feeling of, 'Let's try and build something new.' I came out to that theme for seventeen years and it does feel like, you know what? Let's try some new stuff. Let's try and change it up." [...] However, the closing theme from his previous NBC shows was retained in a slightly altered form.|$|E
