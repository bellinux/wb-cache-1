40|$|Abstract: Reducing {{the risk}} of oil spill {{disasters}} is essential for protecting the environment and reducing economic losses. Oil spill surveillance constitutes {{an important component of}} oil spill disaster management. Advances in remote sensing technologies can help to identify parties potentially responsible for pollution and to identify minor spills before they cause widespread damage. Due to the large number of sensors currently available for oil spill surveillance, {{there is a need for}} a comprehensive overview and comparison of existing sensors. Specifically, this paper examines the characteristics and applications of different sensors. A better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of oil spill surveillance sensors will improve the operational use of these sensors for oil spill response and contingency planning. Laser fluorosensors were found to be the best available sensor for oil spill detection since they not only detect and classify oil on all surfaces but also operate in either the day or night. For example, the Scanning Laser Environmental <b>Airborne</b> <b>Fluorosensor</b> (SLEAF) sensor was identified to be a valuable tool for oil spill surveillance. However, no single sensor was able to provide all information required for oil spill contingency planning. Hence, combinations of sensors are currently used for oil spil...|$|E

Simulation results for linearly varying step concentrations of chlorophyll are presented. The results indicate that statistically significant differences can be seen under certain conditions in the water Raman-normalized fluorescence signals between nonhomogeneous and homogeneous cases.

The system transmits 337 nm UV radiation at the rate of 100 pulses per second and monitors fluorescent emission at 540 nm. Daylight flight tests were made over the areas of controlled oil spills and additional reconnaissance flights were made over a 50 km stretch of the Delaware River to establish ambient oil baseline in the river. The results show that the device is capable of monitoring and mapping out extremely low level oil on water which cannot be identified by ordinary photographic method...|$|R

It has been shown that the sensor can identify and classify oil films. If the extinction coefficient is known then the thickness of thinner films (less than 20 micrometers) may be calculated. The intensity of the water Raman signal is proportional to the water volume sampled by the sensor and hence an effective attenuation coefficient for the water can be calculated. The same Raman measurement provides the normalization necessary to map chlorophyll and dye concentrations using the intensity of their respective fluorescence signatures...|$|R

40|$|A field based laser fluorosensor, {{employing}} a pulsed nitrogen laser and telescope photomultiplier detector system, {{has been successfully}} tested at night from a cliff top site overlooking Lake Ontario providing target ranges greater than 274 meters. Remotely sensed spectra and amplitude changes in the fluorescence emission of natural waters have shown potential as a water quality indicator. In this connection, a convenient internal reference standard with which to gauge the amplitude of the fluorescence signal is realized {{in the form of}} the concurrent water Raman emission. Remote measurements of oil fluorescence emission spectra suggest that <b>airborne</b> laser <b>fluorosensors</b> are capable of detecting and characterizing the oil in a given slick and that environmental aging of these slicks does not significantly alter their fluorescence emission signature...|$|R
40|$|The German Bight {{is one of}} the worldâ€™s busiest {{shipping}} routes. Although {{a complex}} and comprehensive surveil-lance system has been installed by the littoral states, ship accidents cannot be completely precluded. Then chemi-cal pollutants may come into the sea, either in containers or in free form. Fast and exact localisation is an essential requirement for efficient recovery. <b>Airborne</b> <b>fluorosensors</b> are useful tools for the detection of oil spills and other chemicals swimming on the sea surface. Due to the limited penetration depth of light into water, chemicals dispersed in the water column or spread on the seafloor are mostly not detectable. Therefore, a new fluorescence lidar has been developed which will be operated as a payload of an ROV (re-motely operated vehicle). The 3 rd harmonic pulse of a Nd:YAG laser is applied as the light source of the in-strument. Time- and wavelength-resolved signals are detected. Spatial scanning of the water column and the seafloor provides a small-scale localisation of optically active substances, and an analysis of the lidar spectra allows their classification. Additionally, a range gating video camera is integrated in the instrument to receive contrast enhanced images from the seafloor. The expanded second harmonic Nd:YAG laser pulse is used as the illumination source of the camera. These images support the interpretation of the lidar spectra. Furthermore, the ROV is equipped with auxiliary sensors for temperature, conductivity and depth (CTD) and a multispectra transmissometer. The system is specified for a maximum operation depth of 300 m. The submarine fluorescence lidar is an instrument which allows to remotely sense substances on the seafloor. It can also be applied for pipeline inspection and oceano-graphic measurements. Experiments in the laboratory have been carried out with success, and a prototype is in the realisation phase...|$|R

The fluorescent properties of various species of algae {{representative of the}} different color groups are described. Laboratory measurements of fluorescent scattering cross sections is discussed and quantitive data presented. A scattering matrix model is developed to demonstrate the essential requirement of multiwavelength laser excitation {{in order to make}} accurate quantitative measurements of chlorophyll A concentration when more than one color group of algae is present in the water. A practical <b>airborne</b> laser <b>fluorosensor</b> design is considered and analysis of field data discussed. Successful operation of the Langley ALOPE (airborne LIDAR oceanographic probing experiment) system is described and field measurements presented.

The feasibility of remotely measuring alpha by laser radar is discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{differentiate}} classes of oil-spills on water surface, a neural network (NN) approach is applied for spectral data analysis and identification of <b>airborne</b> laser <b>fluorosensor</b> in this paper. The target to be detected {{may be one}} of the following: seawater, lube, diesel, etc. The primary requirement for airborne sensors is to identify the substances targeted by the laser beam. Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) method is one of the most current approaches. This paper outlines the NN model for the identification of the spilled oils, and makes a comparison with PCC in an effort to increase the level of confidence in the identification results. The results of ground tests using known targets show an increased confidence in the results when using the NN Model compared to that of PCC. It is believed that the NN model would play a significant role in the ocean oil-spill identification in the future. Â© Springer-Verlag 2004. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Airborne lidar {{systems have}} {{frequently}} {{been used to}} measure hydrographic parameters under va-rious conditions {{during the past two}} decades. Since 1993, a Do 228 - 212 aircraft, equipped with a laser fluorosensor for detailed analysis of oil spills, has been used for maritime surveillance of the German territory in the North and Baltic Seas. This operational task offers the possibility to monitor hydrographic parameters. In this paper, the power of operational hydrographic measurements with an <b>airborne</b> laser <b>fluorosensor</b> is investigated. Essential features of the recently developed concept of automated distribution among different participants of a monitoring programme will be presen-ted, especially the graphical user interface developed for easy access and evaluation of hydro-graphic laser fluorosensor data. Recent results from the winter and spring periods of 1999 / 2000 will be presented. Prominent features are the distribution of gelbstoff related to water masses and the onset of phytoplankton bloom in the German Bight and the western Baltic Sea. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the results and possible improvements, which underline the demand for a long-term operation...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{artificial}} neural network (ANN) approach, {{which is based on}} flexible nonlinear models for a very broad class of transfer functions, is applied for multi-spectral data analysis and modeling of <b>airborne</b> laser <b>fluorosensor</b> in order to differentiate between classes of oil on water surface. We use three types of algorithm: Perceptron Network, Back-Propagation (B-P) Network and Self-Organizing feature Maps (SOM) Network. Using the data in form of 64 -channel spectra as inputs, the ANN presents the analysis and estimation results of the oil type {{on the basis of the}} type of background materials as outputs. The ANN is trained and tested using sample data set to the network. The results of the above 3 types of network are compared in this paper. It is proved that the training has developed a network that not only fits the training data, but also fits real-world data that the network will process operationally. The ANN model would play a significant role in the ocean oil-spill identification in the future. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{regional}} {{assessment of}} hydrocarbon seepage {{is built around}} a combination of Radarsat and ERS Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, acquired during 1998 and 1999, {{as part of a}} collaborative project between Geoscience Australia, Nigel Press Associates, Radarsat International and AUSLIG (specifically the Australian Centre for Remote Sensing). In total, 55 Radarsat Wide 1 Beam Mode scenes and one ERS scene from the Great Australian Bight (GAB) region were analysed. The data were integrated with regional geological information, and other hydrocarbon migration and seepage indicators such as reprocessed and reinterpreted legacy <b>Airborne</b> Laser <b>Fluorosensor</b> (ALF) data, to provide an assessment of the possible charge characteristics of the region. The results of the study suggest that active, though areally restricted, liquid hydrocarbon seepage is occurring within the Bight Basin. The majority of seepage slicks occur along the outer margin of the major depocentre, the Ceduna Sub-basin, in areas where significant Late Tertiary to Recent faulting extends to the seafloor. Very little evidence of seepage was observed on the SAR data above the main depocentre, which is an area of minimal Late Tertiary to Recent faulting. Reprocessed ALF data reveal three main areas with relatively dense fluors. Although they are not directly coincident with locations of seepage interpreted from SAR data, their distribution support the pattern of preferred leakage along the basin margins. Integration of regional geological models with {{the results of this study}} suggests that structural features related to active tectonism have focused laterally migrating hydrocarbons to produce active seepage at specific locations in the basin. Where these features are absent, seepage may be passive andlor be governed by long distance migration to points of seal failure. Together with oil and gas shows in exploration wells, observations from this study provide further evidence that liquid hydrocarbons have been generated in the Great Australian Bight...|$|R
