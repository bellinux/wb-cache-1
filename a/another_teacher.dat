40|$|These {{guidelines}} set out {{requirements for}} the use of time-out strategies, including dedicated time-out rooms, in NSW government schools.   Time-out strategies include isolation in the student’s classroom, <b>another</b> <b>teacher’s</b> room or with an executive member of staff, or the use of a dedicated time-out room. Time-out strategies include isolation in the student’s classroom, <b>another</b> <b>teacher’s</b> room or with an executive member of staff, or the use of a dedicated time-out room. Good discipline is fundamental to the achievement of Government priorities for the public school system. Schools must implement the Student Welfare Policy and develop a School Discipline Policy consistent with Student Discipline in Government Schools in consultation with the school community. Time-out lies within the continuum of interventions used to assist students to regulate and/or control their behaviour. It is used as a proactive strategy to support self-calming and to provide an opportunity for students to reflect on their actions. Any use of a time-out strategy must take into account factors such as the age, cultural background, individual needs, any disability and the developmental level of the student. The choice of time-out strategy will depend upon: 	the seriousness or frequency of the behaviour 	level of disruption to learning 	risk of harm to the student or others 	risk of damage to property.  ...|$|R
