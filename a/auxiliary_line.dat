40|$|Abstract:- Absorption cycles {{designers}} often utilize p-t-x diagrams {{of working}} mixtures for first suggestion of new absorption cycles. The p-t-x diagrams enable fast correct determination of saturate states of liquid (and gaseous) mixtures of refrigerants and absorbents. The working mixture isn’t only at saturated state during a real working cycle. If we know pressure and temperature of an unsaturated mixture, exact position determination {{is possible in}} the p-t-x diagrams too. But there are still processes uneasy to draw in the p-t-x diagrams, namely adiabatic sorption. The adiabatic sorption is very interesting phenomenon that occurs when vapor of refrigerant is in contact with unsaturated liquid absorbent-refrigerant mixture and exchange of heat is forbid between the system and an environment. This contribution introduces new <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lines</b> that enable correct position determination of the adiabatic sorption process in the p-T-x diagram of ammonia-water system. The presented <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lines</b> were obtained from common functions for fast calculation of water-ammonia system properties.

30|$|Importantly, {{effective}} use of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lines</b> requires consideration {{of the impact of}} intraoperative deflation of the lung. Because the distances between lesions and landmarks change when the lung is collapsed, ratios calculated from points on multiple imaginary <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lines</b> are useful. In this case, for example, the distance from a marking to the interlobar fissure was almost the same as that from the nodule in S 6 to that fissure (Fig.  2 b). Indeed, we have drawn the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lines</b> in complete deflation state. The proportion between these distances would remain similar in the deflated lung.|$|R

2500|$|With the {{electrical}} model of cascaded, series-connected RC (resistor/capacitor) {{elements in the}} electrode pores, the internal resistance increases with the increasing penetration depth of the charge carriers into the pores. The internal DC resistance is time dependent and increases during charge/discharge. In applications often only the switch-on and switch-off range is interesting. The internal resistance Ri can be calculated from the voltage drop ΔV2 {{at the time of}} discharge, starting with a constant discharge current Idischarge.

30|$|Then next {{question}} was whether to take the patient back to the bronchoscopy suite to add more dye markings for the newly found lesions. However, we considered {{we would be able}} to resect the nodules if we extended the existing lung map by adding anatomical landmarks and imaginary <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lines</b> on three-dimensional images rather than adding dye markings, as reported previously [6]. Anatomical landmarks such as the pulmonary ligament are promising guides to detecting barely palpable pulmonary nodules. Moreover, the imaginary <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lines</b> constructed by connecting dye markings and anatomical landmarks are also important guides to detecting such nodules [6]. The present report demonstrates that imaginary <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lines</b> do indeed assist intraoperative location of unexpected tumors. Because the additional tumors were < 5  mm in diameter and both were > 5  mm from the pleural surface, the probability of successfully locating them without markings was extremely low [7]. The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lines</b> combined with VAL-MAP and anatomical landmarks enabled complete resection of all nodules with sufficient surgical margins, as is important in oncological surgery [8]. If we had failed to palpate the additional tumors with the thoracoscopic approach, we would have converted to mini-thoracotomy for better palpation with two fingers rather than one through a thoracic port. If even this strategy had failed, we would have planed the secondary operation after growing them up.|$|R

25|$|Euclid's {{statement}} of the pons asinorum includes a second conclusion that if the equal sides of the triangle are extended below the base, then the angles between the extensions and the base are also equal. Euclid's proof involves drawing <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lines</b> to these extensions. But, as Euclid's commentator Proclus points out, Euclid never uses the second conclusion and his proof can be simplified somewhat by drawing the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lines</b> {{to the sides of}} the triangle instead, the rest of the proof proceeding in {{more or less the same}} way. There has been much speculation and debate as to why, given that it makes the proof more complicated, Euclid added the second conclusion to the theorem. One plausible explanation, given by Proclus, is that the second conclusion can be used in possible objections to the proofs of later propositions where Euclid does not cover every case. The proof relies heavily on what is today called side-angle-side, the previous proposition in the Elements.|$|R

40|$|Bar charts {{have been}} among the most {{commonly}} used types of visualizations throughout the years. They usually visualize a set of scalar data points by encoding the values into the length of the bars. The perception of differences of visual elements in length usually works well preattentively in human. Problems emerge when visual similarities present, due to small value differences or in the presence of big emtrema, causing the domain to stretch. Comparison of similar lengths has been proven to be more difficult when the distance between them increases. This thesis proposes a new approach to the problems. The concept is to turn the area limited by two side edges of a bar and the two <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lines</b> closest to its value into a grid. The cells of this grid are shaded basing on the ratio of value difference of the bar and the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lines.</b> The cells can be divided into sub-grids to express finer values. The stacking of cells forms different shapes for different values, which human are good at detecting. The comparision task is thus performed better with this new technique. Further more, by counting and calculating the total value these cells represent, the value estimation process also achieves higher precision...|$|R
