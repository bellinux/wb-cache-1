5000|$|Neck rot {{caused by}} Botrytis allii occurs in regions {{all over the}} world, but, it is most {{prevalent}} in temperate regions due to their conducive climates. Botrytis allii used to cause significant losses in the onion bulb industry in the UK. Fortunately, by utilization of better harvesting and curing methods, the disease prevalence has decreased. [...] It {{is important that the}} US utilize these methods as well because the onion is a highly produced <b>agronomic</b> <b>crop.</b> In 2005, the US grew 65,000 hectares of onions with a farm gate value of $922 million. Botrytis allii poses a threat to that value because it can potentially cause a 50% reduction in yield if left unchecked. [...] These losses caused by the disease may be even greater than reported. Detection of this disease is difficult due to the morphologically indistinguishable characteristics of Botrytis species cultured on agar. Higher quality detection methods of Botrytis allii are starting to be implemented to better differentiate it from other closely related Botrytis species.

40|$|Results {{of a set}} of four {{regression}} models applied to recent survey data of farmers in eastern Nebraska suggest the causes driving farmer intentions of using weather and climate information and forecasts in farming decisions. The model results quantify the relative importance of attitude, social norm, perceived behavioral control and financial capability in explaining the influence of information about climate conditions, and short- and long-term forecasts on <b>agronomic,</b> <b>crop</b> insurance, and crop marketing decisions. Attitude, serving as a proxy for the utility gained from the use of such information, had the most profound positive influence on the outcome of all the decisions, followed by norms. The norms in the community, as a proxy for the utility gained from allowing one’s self to be influenced by others, played a larger role in agronomic decisions than in insurance or marketing decisions. In addition, the interaction of controllability (accuracy, availability, reliability, timeliness of weather and climate information), self-efficacy (farmer ability and understanding), and general preference for control was shown to be a substantive cause.

It also discusses why long-term average ETref values may not represent non-average years or be accurate enough for irrigation management.

Native and transgenic variants of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crystalline (Cry) toxins control larval lepidopteran feeding upon important <b>agronomic</b> <b>crop</b> plants. Invertebrate Bt resistance phenotypes arise via altered expression of midgut proteases involved in Cry toxin activation (trypsins) and degradation (chymotrypsins), reduced toxin binding to N-acetylgalactoseamine (GalNAc) modified peptide receptors (cadherin, aminopeptidase, or alkaline phosphatase), or receptor glycosylation pathway knockouts (beta- 1, 3 -galactosyltransferases; beta 3 GalT 5). Ostrinia nubilalis trypsin, chymotrypsin, cadherin, and beta 3 GalT 5 cDNA clones, transcript expression, and partial genomic genomic DNA copies were characterized. Mendelian inheritance of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and cadherin genomic DNA markers suggest association between allele segregation and Bt resistance phenotypes can be conducted. Movement of O. nubilalis moths was indirectly estimated by genetic similarity between North American subpopulations using mitochondrial and genomic microsatellite markers.

Compared to controls, {{differences in the}} concentration of different mineral nutrients occurred in leaves collected shortly after fruit harvest: in Pbz-treated trees, the concentration of N and K significantly decreased, whereas that of Mg and Mn increased. Leaves of trees sprayed with GA 3 had a significantly lower concentration of N and Ca and Mn, and a slightly greater concentration of K. In spite of these changes, element concentrations were within accepted ranges and therefore the nutritional status of peach trees did not change with the application of both growth regulators. Pbz did not alter the concentrations of chlorophylls, whereas GA 3 significantly reduced the concentrations of chlorophylls a and b.
