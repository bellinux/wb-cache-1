5|$|In {{the days}} before the {{beginning}} of the race, there was controversy over the first stage. On <b>arriving</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start, the teams discovered that the route used a variety of road surfaces, crossed sandy sections and included several ramps. As a result, the race organisers decided to neutralise the stage: the teams therefore competed only for the stage victory and for the team classification, not for the general classification.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton's first task, on <b>arriving</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Stromness station, was {{to arrange}} for his three companions at Peggoty Camp to be picked up.

5|$|The {{penetration}} front propagates {{to minimize}} the surface energy until it reaches {{the edges of the}} drop, thus <b>arriving</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Wenzel state. Since the solid can be considered an absorptive material due to its surface roughness, this phenomenon of spreading and imbibition is called hemiwicking. The contact angles at which spreading/imbibition occurs are between 0 and π/2.|$|E

5|$|Written by Pennant Roberts, this four-part {{story was}} {{commissioned}} on 10 January 1979 as Dragons of Fear.

His efforts met with external opposition from Prussia, Russia and Austria, all interested in keeping the Commonwealth weak; and from internal conservative interests, which saw reforms as threatening their traditional liberties and prerogatives.|$|E
