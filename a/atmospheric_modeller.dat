40|$|This {{paper is}} the {{outgrowth}} of a workshop on the Detection of Trends in Wet Deposition Data, attended by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>modellers,</b> <b>atmospheric</b> chemists and statisticians in Toronto, November 1983. Methods for detecting changes or trends in network data which are described and evaluated include statistical and meteorological analyses of ‘before’ and ‘after’ time series at single stations, {{the analysis of}} changes in frequency distributions, and the analysis of entire network data sets. Relative advantages of using precipitation concentration vs deposition data sets are examined, and the added information on trends available from air concentration measurements (SO 2 and particle-SO 42 −) is shown. The paper concludes with recommendations for data requirements and preferred approaches to trend or change detection using available statistical and modelling techniques...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{discuss the}} ways in which {{atmospheric}} numerical models can be shown to have both predictive and ex-planatory value. This argument rests largely on the established predictive value of numerical weather forecasts, and can be extended to atmospheric models at larger- and smaller scales. We demonstrate that <b>atmospheric</b> <b>modellers</b> have not been particularly critical about the logical basis of model evaluation, and recommend strategic approaches to remedy this. Our suggestions involve the creation of a spatio-temporal scale-dependent and context-relative ordinal scale for model evalua-tion that must be applied in an a-priori, context-dependent fashion...|$|R

40|$|Digital filters, {{originally}} {{developed in the}} context of Discrete-time Signal Processing (DSP), have recently been used for the analysis and solution of problems in geophysics. In the field of numerical weather prediction these filters have been applied to the problems of initialization and objective analysis, and they have considerable potential for other applications in NWP. The theory of digital filters is presented in this report, with the interests of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>modellers</b> in mind. Both non-recursive and recursive lters are discussed, and applications of both of these to initialization are described. The purpose of the report is to provide a gentle introduction to digital filtering, with emphasis on the aspects thought to be most important for NWP applications. The report should give the reader easier access to the more recondite treatments of filtering available in the DSP literature...|$|R

40|$|A set {{of global}} {{greenhouse}} gas emission inventories has been compiled per source category for the 1990 annual emissions of the direct greenhouse gases CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O, {{as well as of}} the indirect greenhouse gases (ozone precursors) CO, NOx and NMVOC, and of SO 2. The inventories are available by sector, both on a per country/region basis and on a 1 °× 1 ° grid. Developed by TNO and RIVM for constructing the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) Version 2. 0, in co-operation with the Global Emission Inventory Activity (GEIA) of IGAC/IGBP, the inventories meet the needs of both policy-makers and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>modellers.</b> The data sources for activity data, emission factors and grid maps are discussed with the focus on anthropogenic sources of primarily CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O. The estimates of a standard group of anthropogenic sources are presented for each compound per world region. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} framework was constructed by {{which one can}} estimate the relative role of different processes in the dynamics of atmospheric nucleation mode particles. The framework relies on 14 timescales that describe (1) changes in the total nuclei number concentration, (2) changes in the mean diameter of the nucleation mode and (3) concentrations of low-volatile vapours responsible {{for the growth of}} nuclei. The magnitude of the derived timescales can be calculated relatively easily from the available measurement or modelling data. Application to the lower-troposphere revealed that under most conditions removal of nuclei is dominated by their coagulation with larger background particles and that this process competes very strongly with growth of nuclei to sizes relevant to atmospheric chemistry and physics. With some exceptions, self-coagulation of nuclei was shown to be of marginal importance compared with their growth by condensation and their removal by coagulation. Finally, by comparing predictions based on relevant timescales with those obtained from detailed numerical simulations, quantitative criteria were derived concerning (1) when one may neglect self-coagulation of nuclei when looking at nucleation mode dynamics and (2) when the whole nucleation mode can be neglected because of its eventual removal. These criteria are extremely useful for <b>atmospheric</b> <b>modellers</b> who need to simplify their models as much as possible. From the modelling point of view, other processes requiring further attention are the introduction of new nuclei into the system and decrease in nuclei number concentration due to dilution of the air. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGround-based {{remote sensing}} {{observatories}} have {{a crucial role}} to play in providing data to improve our understanding of atmospheric processes, to test the performance of atmospheric models, and to develop new methods for future space-borne observations. Institut Pierre Simon Laplace, a French research institute in environmental sciences, created the Site Instrumental de Recherche par Télédétection Atmosphérique (SIRTA), an atmospheric observatory with these goals in mind. Today SIRTA, located 20 km south of Paris, operates a suite a state-of-the-art active and passive remote sensing instruments dedicated to routine monitoring of cloud and aerosol properties, and key atmospheric parameters. Detailed description {{of the state of the}} atmospheric column is progressively archived and made accessible to the scientific community. This paper describes the SIRTA infrastructure and database, and provides an overview of the scientific research associated with the observatory. Researchers using SIRTA data conduct research on atmospheric processes involving complex interactions between clouds, aerosols and radiative and dynamic processes in the <b>atmospheric</b> column. <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>modellers</b> working with SIRTA observations develop new methods to test their models and innovative analyses to improve parametric representations of sub-grid processes that must be accounted for in the model. SIRTA provides the means to develop data interpretation tools for future active remote sensing missions in space (e. g. CloudSat and CALIPSO). SIRTA observation and research activities take place in networks of atmospheric observatories that allow scientists to access consistent data sets from diverse regions on the globe...|$|R
40|$|Time {{splitting}} is {{a numerical}} procedure used in solution of partial diﬀerential equations whose solutions allow multiple time scales. Numerical schemes are split for handling the stiﬀness in equations, i. e. {{when there are}} multiple time scales with a few time scales being smaller than the others. When there are such terms with smaller time scales, due to the Courant number restriction, the computational cost becomes high if these terms are treated explicitly. In the present work a nonlinear advective equation is solved numerically using diﬀerent techniques based on a generalised framework for splitting methods. The nonlinear advective equation was chosen because it has an analytical solution making comparisons with numerical schemes amenable and also because its nonlinearity mimics the equations encountered in atmospheric modelling. Using the nonlinear advective equation as a test bed, {{an analysis of the}} splitting methods and their inﬂuence on the split solutions has been made. An understanding of inﬂuence of splitting schemes requires knowledge of behaviour of unsplit schemes beforehand. Hence a study on unsplit methods has also been made. In the present work, using the nonlinear advective equation, it shown that the three time level schemes have high phase errors and underestimate energy (even though they have a higher order of accuracy in time). It is also found that the leap-frog method, which is used widely in atmospheric modelling, is the worst among examined unsplit methods. The semi implicit method, again a popular splitting method with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>modellers</b> is the worst among examined split methods. Three time-level schemes also need explicit ﬁltering to remove the computational mode. This ﬁltering can have a signiﬁcant impact on the obtained numerical solutions, and hence three-time level schemes appear to be unattractive {{in the context of the}} nonlinear convective equation. Based on this experience, splitting methods for the two-time level schemes is proposed. These schemes realistically capture the phase and energy of the nonlinear advective equation...|$|R
25|$|He developed, with Prof J Troe, easily used {{approximate}} {{solutions for}} the pressure dependence of the rate coefficient. He provided the first solutions for cases where angular momentum conservation needs to be incorporated. His methods are used by experimentalists to fit data and extrapolate to different pressure regimes, supplanting previous tools which were of dubious validity and accuracy. His coworkers and he obtained data on the collisional energy transfer process and used them to prove the conjecture that each collision involves only a small exchange of energy. He then developed the first rigorous means to calculate these quantities from basic theory, and the first physical model for the process. His work is widely used, both for basic understanding of the transition states and by <b>atmospheric</b> and combustion <b>modellers.</b> Predicting climate change and effects on the ozone layer rely critically on this modelling.|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the serious {{consequences}} of the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption (Iceland) on civil aviation, 52 volcanologists, meteorologists, <b>atmospheric</b> dispersion <b>modellers</b> and space and ground-based monitoring specialists from 12 different countries (including representatives from 6 Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres and related institutions) gathered to discuss the needs of the ash dispersal modelling community, investigate new data-acquisition strategies (i. e. quantitative measurements and observations) and discuss how to improve communication between the research community and institutions with an operational mandate. Based on a dedicated benchmark exercise and on 3 days of in-depth discussion, recommendations have been made for future model improvements, new strategies of ash cloud forecasting, multidisciplinary data acquisition and more efficient communication between different communities. Issues addressed in the workshop include ash dispersal modelling, uncertainty, ensemble forecasting, combining dispersal models and observations, sensitivity analysis, model variability, data acquisition, pre-eruption forecasting, first simulation and data assimilation, research priorities and new communication strategies to improve information flow and operational routines. As a main conclusion, model developers, meteorologists, volcanologists and stakeholders need to work closely together to develop new and improved strategies for ash dispersal forecasting and, in particular, to: (1) improve the definition of the source term, (2) design models and forecasting strategies that can better characterize uncertainties, (3) explore and identify the best ensemble strategies that can be adapted to ash dispersal forecasting, (4) identify optimized strategies for the combination of models and observations and (5) implement new critical operational strategies. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the serious {{consequences}} of the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption on civil aviation, more than 50 volcanologists, meteorologists, <b>atmospheric</b> dispersion <b>modellers,</b> and space and ground-based monitoring specialists from 12 different countries (including representatives from 6 Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers and related institutions) gathered at the WMO headquarters in Geneva (for acronym definitions, see Appendix 1) to discuss the needs of the ash-dispersal modelling community, investigate new data-acquisition 1 strategies and discuss how to improve communication between volcanological community and operational agencies. Based on a dedicated benchmark exercise and on three days of indepth discussion, recommendations have been made for future model improvements, new strategies of ash forecasting, multidisciplinary data acquisition, and more efficient communication amongst different communities. Issues addressed in the Workshop and key findings include: 1. Ash dispersal modelling. VATDM developers need to make a significant effort in collaboration with volcanologists and meteorologists to improve the definition of the source term (mainly mass eruption rate, grainsize distribution and mass distribution along the eruption column) and some critical aspects of particle sedimentation (i. e., particle aggregation and wet deposition), particularly if concentration has to be computed. 2. Uncertainty. VATDM developers need to make an effort to design models and forecasting strategies that can better characterize uncertainties. In fact, both the intrinsic behaviour of the natural system and input data (i. e., volcanological and meteorological data) are affected by various levels of uncertainties that need to be accounted for in order to compile comprehensive descriptions of particle transport and sedimentation. Stakeholders (e. g., aviation companies, decision makers) need to integrate probabilistic strategies into their processes of decision making. 3. Ensemble forecasting. Ash dispersal forecasting could be significantly improved through the implementation of ensemble forecasting strategies, namely: i) ensemble of input variables, ii) ensemble of VATDM (multi model), iii) ensemble on NWP and iv) ensemble on both VATDM and NWP. VATDM developers both from meteorology and volcanology fields need to explore and identify the best ensemble strategies that can be adapted to ash dispersal forecasting. 4. Combination of VATDM and observations. Real-time assimilation of observations into VATDM is crucial to model accuracy and hence to aviation safety. VATDM developers and monitoring specialists need to identify optimized strategies for the combination of models and observations...|$|R
40|$|Methods are {{developed}} for predicting rate coefficients for reactions of initiators of tropospheric oxidation with unsaturated compounds that are {{abundant in the}} atmosphere; prognostic tools of this kind are essential for <b>atmospheric</b> chemists and <b>modellers.</b> To pursue the aim of exploring such tools, the kinetics of reactions of NO 3, OH and O- 3 {{with a series of}} alkenes are examined for correlations relating the logarithms of the rate coefficients to the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of the alkenes. A comparison of the values predicted by the correlations with experimental data (where the latter exist) allowed us to assess the reliability of our method. We used a series of theoretical methods to calculate the HOMO energies, and found that higher computational effort improves the agreement of the predicted rate coefficients with experimental values, especially for reactions of NO 3 with alkenes that possess vinyllic halogen substituents. As a consequence, it is expedient to suggest new correlations to replace those presented by us and others that were based on the lower level of theory. We propose the following correlations for the reactions of NO 3, OH and O- 3 with alkenes: ln(k(NO 3) /cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1)) = 6. 40 (E-HOMO/eV) + 31. 69, ln(k(OH) /cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1)) = 1. 21 (E-HOMO/eV) - 12. 34 and ln(k(O 3) /cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1)) = 3. 28 (E-HOMO/eV) - 6. 78. These new correlations have been developed using the larger experimental data sets now available, and the impact of the extended data {{on the quality of the}} correlations is examined in the paper. Atmospheric lifetimes have been calculated from both experimental and estimated rate coefficients to provide an overview of removal efficiencies for different classes of alkenes with respect to oxidative processes initiated by NO 3, OH and O- 3. A figure is presented to show the spatial scales over which alkenes may survive transport in competition with attack by NO 3, OH and O- 3. Removal by NO 3 or OH is always more important than removal by O- 3, and reactions with NO 3 dominate for scales up to a few hundred metres...|$|R
