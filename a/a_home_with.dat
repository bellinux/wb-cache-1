5|$|In {{light of}} the {{building}} feud, Spencer's sister Stephanie Pratt initially took a disliking to Conrad. However, she later apologized to Conrad for an earlier confrontation, and the pair became friends. Their relationship put a burden on Pratt's relationship with her brother and Montag, who reacted by beginning to alienate her. Conrad and Port eventually left their positions at Teen Vogue after receiving employment from Kelly Cutrone's PR firm People's Revolution. By {{the end of the}} season, Conrad and Patridge had moved out of their apartment and purchased <b>a</b> <b>home,</b> <b>with</b> new housemate Bosworth becoming a distancing factor between the former two.|$|E
5|$|Other {{plans for}} {{memorials}} included {{a garden of}} remembrance at the BDP firm's studio in Bristol, a published anthology of Yeates' work and an annual landscape design prize named after her for students of the University of Gloucestershire. BDP announced it would dedicate a charity cycle ride between its offices on its 50th anniversary, with proceeds to go to charities selected by her family. Yeates left behind an estate valued at £47,000, which included money set aside to purchase <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> Reardon. As she had not written a will, the sum was inherited by her parents.|$|E
5|$|Then, in 1924, Buck fell pregnant. The couple {{agreed that}} she should return to England for better {{healthcare}} during the birth, and she went there to set up <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> her mother's help. In early November 1924 she gave birth prematurely to a son, Anthony, {{and a few days}} later died of poisoning from chloroform administered against the pain of delivery. The grief-stricken Keable's own health worsened and he was advised to return to Tahiti; the baby, too weak to travel, was left in England with Jack and Rita Elliott, friends of the couple's since the Ralston Street salon days. The Elliotts were eventually to adopt him.|$|E

5|$|Thatcher {{reformed}} {{local government}} taxes by replacing domestic rates (a tax {{based on the}} nominal rental value of <b>a</b> <b>home)</b> <b>with</b> the Community Charge (or poll tax) in which the same amount was charged to each adult resident. The new tax was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and in England and Wales the following year, and proved {{to be among the}} most unpopular policies of her premiership. Public disquiet culminated in a 70,000 to 200,000-strong demonstration in London on 31 March 1990; the demonstration around Trafalgar Square deteriorated into riots, leaving 113 people injured and 340 under arrest. The Community Charge was abolished in 1991 by her successor, John Major. It has since transpired that Thatcher had herself failed to register for the tax, and was threatened with financial penalties if she did not return her form.|$|E

25|$|Before courtyards, open {{fires were}} kept burning {{in a central}} place within <b>a</b> <b>home,</b> <b>with</b> only a small hole in the ceiling {{overhead}} to allow smoke to escape.

25|$|In {{considering}} {{the issue of}} possible reunification of some sex offenders into homes with a non-offending parent and children, it has been advised that any sex offender with a significant criminal history should be assessed on the PCL-R, and if they score 18 or higher, then they should be excluded from any consideration of being placed in <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> children under any circumstances. There is, however, increasing concern that PCL scores are too inconsistent between different examiners, including in its use to evaluate sex offenders.|$|E

Their marriage remained a secret for many years while they lived in separate homes. In Los Angeles, Colbert shared <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> her mother Jeanne Chauchoin, but her domineering mother disliked Foster and did not allow him into their home.

25|$|Littlejohn {{was accused}} of taking {{insufficient}} care to check the facts before publishing an article critical of cookery writer and poverty campaigner Jack Monroe. Littlejohn suggested Monroe, who prefers the singular they pronoun, chose {{to give up their}} job; in fact Monroe's young boy was unsettled with a range of different carers. As Monroe had grown up in <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> foster children they are aware of the potential for harming him. Monroe tried unsuccessfully to negotiate flexible hours so they could work and look after their baby, but gave up their job so they could look after the child better. Littlejohn suggested incorrectly Monroe was an unemployed welfare claimant.|$|E
25|$|After Davy {{left the}} Met in 1961, her career {{was no longer}} {{centered}} in New York but in Europe; a decision she made after marrying Swiss stockbroker Herman Penningsfield in 1959 and making <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> him in Geneva. She began transitioning towards a major European career in 1959 when she performed Aida at both the Vienna State Opera under Herbert von Karajan and at the Royal Opera, London. That same year she performed the role of Dido in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino. She sang Aida again at the Teatro Regio in Parma in 1960, and was Aida to Jon Vickers' Radamès at the 1961 Berliner Festspiele {{under the direction of}} Wieland Wagner.|$|E
25|$|Chief Justice Roberts {{feared the}} Court's ruling {{would limit the}} ability of police to combat {{domestic}} violence. Chief Justice Roberts {{also noted that the}} purpose of the Fourth Amendment was to protect individual privacy, but any person who shares a dwelling (or, as Chief Justice Roberts points out, a locker or a hard drive) with another person may anticipate that the other person sharing access to their belongings might turn them over to authorities. In short, to share <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> someone is to surrender privacy as to that person, who might then consent to an invasion of it. Roberts also asserted that the majority opinion was arbitrary, as previous case law had held an objecting resident who was being held in the police car, as opposed to in the house, could be ignored with respect to the search.|$|E

500|$|Soon after Nixon's selection, {{controversy}} erupted {{over the}} senator's 1951 purchase of <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> a restrictive covenant that forbade resale or rental to Jews. Chotiner, a Jew, successfully {{appealed to the}} Anti-Defamation League and the Jewish press for support for Nixon in the controversy, providing them {{with a list of}} Jewish causes which he had favored. Nixon's staff pointed out that the covenant was, in any event, invalid because of the U.S. Supreme Court's 1948 ruling in Shelley v. Kraemer. The controversy [...] "failed to gain fatal traction" [...] but repeatedly surfaced in later Nixon campaigns.|$|E
