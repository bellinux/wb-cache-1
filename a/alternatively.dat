5|$|<b>Alternatively,</b> {{skeletonised}} animals {{could have}} fed {{directly on the}} relatively undefended Ediacaran biota.|$|E
5|$|Malkin Tower is {{sometimes}} <b>alternatively</b> {{referred to as}} Malking Tower, or Mocking Tower.|$|E
5|$|A direct {{train to}} Ramnagar runs from New Delhi. <b>Alternatively,</b> one {{can come up}} to Haldwani/Kashipur/Kathgodam and come to Ramnagar by road.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alternatively</b> some 20th century {{scholars}} have suggested different years, such as 568 or 569.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alternatively,</b> Maurice Courland's 1957 {{obituary}} {{claims the}} East Midwood Jewish Center as his work. Courland also designed {{a number of}} synagogues and New York landmarks, including Brooklyn's Magen David Synagogue.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alternatively,</b> a Reuleaux {{triangle}} may {{be constructed}} from an equilateral triangle T by drawing three arcs of circles, each centered at one vertex of T and connecting {{the other two}} vertices.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alternatively,</b> a {{hierarchical}} clustering may be {{represented as a}} binary tree with the points at its leaves; the clusters of the clustering are the sets of points in subtrees descending from each node of the tree.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alternatively,</b> {{should the}} Earth survive being engulfed to the Sun, the {{ablation}} and vaporization mentioned before may strip both its crust and mantle leaving just its core.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alternatively,</b> the {{children}} could sole physical custody, with {{the children}}'s primarily residence with {{only one of the}} parents, but grant joint legal custody such that both parents share authority over important decisions that affect a child.|$|E
5|$|Mixed valence {{palladium}} complexes exist, e.g. Pd4(CO)4(OAc)4Pd(acac)2 {{forms an}} infinite Pd chain structure, with <b>alternatively</b> interconnected Pd4(CO)4(OAc)4 and Pd(acac)2 units.|$|E
5|$|Non-Jewish wine (stam yeinam): {{wine that}} while not {{produced}} for idolatrous purposes may {{otherwise have been}} poured for such a purpose or <b>alternatively</b> when consumed will lead to intermarriage.|$|E
5|$|Some sources <b>alternatively</b> state Thompson {{decided to}} join the United States Army as an {{opportunity}} to escape poverty, or that he was drafted.|$|E
5|$|The monarch touched (or, <b>alternatively,</b> stroked) {{the face}} or {{neck of the}} {{infected}} person.|$|E
5|$|Two related Asian Turdus thrushes, the white-collared {{blackbird}} (T. albocinctus) and the grey-winged blackbird (T. boulboul), {{are also}} named blackbirds, and the Somali thrush (T. (olivaceus) ludoviciae) is <b>alternatively</b> {{known as the}} Somali blackbird.|$|E
5|$|A stay-at-home dad (<b>alternatively,</b> {{stay at home}} father, house dad, SAHD, househusband, or house-spouse) is {{a father}} who is the main {{caregiver}} {{of the children and}} is the homemaker of the household. As families have evolved, the practice of being a stay-at-home dad has become more common, and socially more acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Akodon caenosus is a rodent in {{the genus}} Akodon found in northwestern Argentina and south-central Bolivia. Since its {{description}} in 1918, {{it has been}} <b>alternatively</b> classified as a separate species or a subspecies of Akodon lutescens (formerly Akodon puer). The species Akodon aliquantulus, described from some very small Argentine specimens in 1999, is now recognized as a synonym of A.caenosus.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} forces, the Great Heathen Army then invaded Wessex, perhaps in December 870, {{which would have}} been within a few weeks after Edmund's death. <b>Alternatively</b> the Danes may have spent a year pillaging and {{consolidating}} their position in East Anglia before proceeding to attack Mercia and Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alternatively</b> dsRNA can be {{supplied}} without genetic engineering. One {{approach is to}} add them to irrigation water. The molecules are absorbed into the plants' vascular system and poison insects feeding on them. Another approach involves spraying dsRNA like a conventional pesticide. This would allow faster adaptation to resistance. Such approaches would require low cost sources of dsRNAs that do not currently exist.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alternatively,</b> Dawn Landua-McCormack {{suggested}} that the Southern South Saqqara pyramid {{could have been a}} candidate for Neferhotep's burial site. This pyramid, datable to the middle 13th Dynasty, was provided with two elaborate sarcophagus chambers which might have been destined for two wealthy brother kings of the dynasty such as Neferhotep I and Sobekhotep IV.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alternatively,</b> Thomas De Quincey in {{his work}} titled; Rosicrucians and Freemasonry, put forward the theory which {{suggested}} that Freemasonry was possibly an outgrowth of Rosicrucianism. The theory had also been postulated in 1803 by German professor; J. G. Buhle.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alternatively,</b> {{a two-thirds}} {{majority}} of both Virginia houses may call {{for the creation of}} a constitutional convention. Any revisions or amendments proposed by the constitutional convention are presented to the citizens of Virginia and become law upon approval by a majority of voters.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alternatively,</b> prey animals {{might be}} {{sufficiently}} gregarious to form clusters tight enough {{to enhance the}} warning signal. If the species was already unpalatable, predators might learn to avoid the cluster, protecting gregarious individuals with the new aposematic trait. Gregariousness would assist predators to learn to avoid unpalatable, gregarious prey. Aposematism could also be favoured in dense populations even if these are not gregarious.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alternatively,</b> the Rover Hendrix act break joke {{has been}} {{called one of the}} worst jokes in The Simpsons history by the writers and producers. In 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed the Smashing Pumpkins' and Cypress Hill's {{performances}} among the 33 funniest cameos {{in the history of the}} show. Andrew Martin of Prefix Mag named Cypress Hill his sixth-favorite musical guests on The Simpsons out of a list of ten.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alternatively,</b> the {{ancestor}} of Oryzomys peninsulae may have arrived by rafting {{during the late}} Miocene, about six million years ago, when {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California peninsula was an island located near what is now Nayarit and Jalisco in western Mexico. Some plants and birds from the area may have a similar biogeographic heritage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alternatively,</b> {{when one}} board finishes, play can {{continue}} on the other board. In this case, pieces in reserve can still be dropped, but no new pieces are coming in. The outcome of the match is then decided by adding the score of the two boards.|$|E
5|$|Although it has {{not been}} shown {{experimentally}} if the spores can survive the passage through an animal's digestive tract, the regular presence of Cyathus on cow or horse manure strongly suggest that this is true. <b>Alternatively,</b> the hard outer casing of peridioles ejected from splash cups may simply disintegrate over time, eventually releasing the spores within.|$|E
5|$|As deduced {{from the}} {{presence}} of freshwater molluscs, Lake Cahuilla was a freshwater lake during its highstand, while lower lake level stages show fossil evidence of increased salinity. <b>Alternatively</b> the lake may have been brackish. The salinity may have been lower where the Colorado entered the lake and higher farther north.|$|E
5|$|Both {{articles}} {{address the}} issue of who the killer could <b>alternatively</b> have been, and both of them mention Carol's other lovers, and John Rapson, responsible for murdering Carol's sister. Both of the articles mention {{that he was in the}} Barrow area around the time of the murder, but both of them are careful to point out that they are not accusing him of being the murderer.|$|E
5|$|Domitian {{opened the}} year {{following}} the revolt by sharing the consulship with Nerva. Again, the honour suggested Nerva {{had played a}} part in uncovering the conspiracy, perhaps in a fashion similar to what he did during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero. <b>Alternatively,</b> Domitian may have selected Nerva as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status-quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed, and the Empire could return to order.|$|E
5|$|In 'Empire Mode,' {{the player}} can choose a ruler for their forces, {{along with two}} main generals. Three minor lieutenants can also be chosen for support. In battle, the capture of enemy {{officers}} is possible by lowering their morale and defeating them. If, {{at the end of}} the battle, the player is victorious, it is possible to hire the captured officer or, <b>alternatively,</b> release them.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, a {{magnificent}} ship-burial was discovered under a large mound at Sutton Hoo, in Suffolk. Although RÃ¦dwald is usually {{considered to have}} been buried with the ship (or commemorated by it), another possibility is Eorpwald. <b>Alternatively,</b> he might also have had his own ship-burial nearby.|$|E
5|$|In {{homes and}} urban environments, the pests are the rodents, birds, insects and other organisms that share the habitat with humans, and that feed on and spoil possessions. Control of these pests is {{attempted}} through exclusion, repulsion, physical removal or chemical means. <b>Alternatively,</b> various methods of biological control {{can be used}} including sterilisation programmes.|$|E
5|$|Independent {{companies}} {{also provide a}} battery replacement service, returning the original unit with new battery but original case. <b>Alternatively</b> {{it is possible for}} a technically competent user to buy and install a new battery. The task does not require soldering, but is technically challenging.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{loitering}} munitions {{were not}} {{referred to as}} such but rather as suicide UAVs or loitering missiles. Different sources point at different projects as originating the weapon category. The early 1980s initial Israeli Delilah variants or the failed US AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow program are mentioned by some sources. <b>Alternatively,</b> the late 1980s IAI Harpy which was widely exported is considered by some as the first loitering munition system.|$|E
5|$|Instead of re-applying the {{unspent balance}} {{from the general}} fund to the same programs, the city council may choose {{to spend the money}} on other programs. <b>Alternatively,</b> they may use the balance to cut taxes or pay off a {{long-term}} debt. With a large surplus, reducing the tax burden will normally be the preferred choice.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to check whether a given directed graph is a DAG in linear time, either by attempting to find a topological ordering and then testing for each edge whether the resulting ordering is valid or <b>alternatively,</b> for some topological sorting algorithms, by verifying that the algorithm successfully orders all the vertices without meeting an error condition.|$|E
