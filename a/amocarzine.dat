40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} the macrofilaricidal drug, <b>amocarzine,</b> on the evolution of chorioretinopathy in onchocerciasis. METHODS: A prospective uncontrolled cohort study was performed using subjects infected with Onchocerca volvulus in a hyperendemic onchocerciasis focus in Esmeraldas Province in Ecuador. Study subjects were recruited into four cohorts in which ophthalmic and parasitological data were collected for 2, 3, 4, and 5 years respectively. RESULTS: Complete ophthalmic follow up was obtained for 294 individuals in the four cohorts. The incidence of retinal pigment epithelial atrophy tended to remain constant between cohorts while that of chorioretinal scarring with a greater observation period. The incidence rate of cases with new or extending chorioretinal lesions was greater with an increasing period of follow up. An association was seen between the cumulative microfilarial loads in the skin and the development of new chorioretinal lesions (p < 0. 05). No relation was noted between cumulative microfilarial loads and the progression of existing disease. CONCLUSION: <b>Amocarzine</b> therapy did not prevent the natural evolution of chorioretinal disease. It was suggested that ocular microfilariae were necessary for the induction of chorioretinopathy in previously unaffected eyes and that extension of existing disease might also be related to the presence of ocular microfilariae or to other immunological mechanisms...|$|E
30|$|Compound 1 was {{dissolved}} in[*]≥[*] 99.9 % sterile {{dimethyl sulfoxide}} (SIGMA, USA) giving a stock concentration of 5  µg/ml. The compound was prepared at 2 × the final concentration and distributed to wells containing parasites. For the microfilariae, 100  µL was added while 1  mL {{was added to}} wells containing adult worms to give a final volume of 200  µL and 4  mL for microfilariae and adult worms respectively. All the cultures were conducted for 120  h post addition of the compound. Auranofin [34], served as positive control for adult worm assay while ivermectin and <b>amocarzine</b> were used as positive control drugs for O. ochengi and L. loa mfs respectively. The diluent (dimethyl sulfoxide) {{was added to the}} negative control wells. Inhibition of microfilariae motility was assessed using an inverted microscope. Effect of compound on adult worm viability was assessed using the MTT-formazan assay following procedures employed by [32, 33].|$|E
