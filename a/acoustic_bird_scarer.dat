40|$|Often {{perceived}} as pests, pigeon control is applied without investigating environmental, ecological and anthropogenic factors which affect their populations {{and response to}} controls. Estate Management of the University of South Africa’s Muckleneuk campus identified a need to investigate and address a perceived pigeon problem. Staff perceptions regarding the presence and attitude towards control of the pigeons was undertaken through an online Survey Monkey questionnaire and semi- structured interviews until saturation was achieved. It was determined that the a s sumed negative perception towards the pigeons was in fact incorrect. Participants would rather encourage the nesting and breeding activities of pigeons on campus, as they felt that the human–pigeon interactions and viewing of squabs in nests contributed positively to their work environment. Participants did not consider the pigeons or their related activities to pose a problem. It was felt that should control be imposed, the birds should rather be humanely managed through non-lethal measures rather than eradication. Pigeon numbers on five buildings on the University’s campus were counted at dawn and dusk, every week, for two years. The first year provided baseline data and the second year was when control measures were applied. The study determined that the pigeon population index fluctuated seasonally while breeding occurred throughout the year, with notable peaks and declines relating to physiological and population dynamics. The pigeons seemed to make opportunistic use of crop availability in surrounding farmlands during optimal production periods, while conserving energy when not favourable. Site selection in relation to building aspect indicated significant differences in all the seasons except for winter, while a positive significant relationship between level height and pigeon number was recorded. Once the control measures were applied, the total pigeon index on the campus declined by 50 %. Control structures differed significantly in efficacy. Bird spikes indicated the highest efficacy at reducing the pigeon population index and seasonality did influence this efficiency. Birds of prey and an audio <b>bird</b> <b>scarer</b> were used to compare actual versus implied predator presence, {{it was determined that}} there was an association between method of scaring and the number of pigeons observed on the different time periods. Pigeons were observed to continue the natural trend of dispersion and return at the dawn and dusk counts during the audio <b>bird</b> <b>scarer</b> trial without being actively discouraged or dislodged from the building. Pigeons reacted positively to the visual raptor presence, which caused them to take flight from the buildings. The visual effect was only temporary however as pigeons returned once the threat had been removed 10 minutes post scare. The studies concluded in an interdisciplinary management plan presented to the University Estates. Environmental ScienceM. Sc. (Environmental Science...|$|R

5000|$|In 2013, Dr. John Swaddle and Dr. Mark Hinders at the College of William and Mary {{created a}} new method of {{deterring}} birds and other animals using benign sounds projected by conventional and directional (parametric) speakers. [...] The initial objectives of the technology were to displace problematic birds from airfields to reduce bird strike risks, minimize agricultural losses due to pest bird foraging, displace nuisance birds that cause extensive repair and chronic clean-up costs, and reduce bird mortality from flying into man-made structures. The sounds, {{referred to as a}} “Sonic Net,” {{do not have to be}} loud and are a combination of wave forms - collectively called [...] "colored" [...] noise - forming non-constructive and constructive interference with how birds and other animals such as deer talk to each other.

Chemical repellents, <b>bird</b> <b>scarers,</b> and exclusion netting {{are being used to}} keep birds away by taste, fright and containment. Habitat management using grasses with selected endophytes may be a new tool for minimizing bird nuisance problems in these industries. Canada geese (Branta Canadensis) were offered selected ryegrass/endophyte Neotyphodium lolli seed and herbage {{to examine the effects of}} known endophyte alkaloids on their feeding behavior in 2000 - 2001. Forty geese were captured annually, contained in fenced areas by wing clipping and fed entophyte-free herbage and seed for a 3 -week period prior to starting any treatments. In a choice 60;cafeteria 61; and no choice feeding trial, geese consumed 30 % less herbage containing the selected endophyte than the endophyte-free ryegrass herbage. In a seed feeding trial, the geese did not discriminate on first exposure between the endophyte-free seed and that containing the selected endophytes. However, on day two there was an 80 % rejection of the seed containing the selected ryegrass/endophyte compared to the endophyte-free seed. The same rejection of 80 % was observed after a 3 -month endophyte-free feeding period, suggesting the rejection was a long-term, learned response or post-digestion feedback. The authors suggest continued research into this area will be of benefit in producing a living deterrent to birds by habitat modification. Learned-behavior response has been well documented in the past as the way forward. Farming grass/endophyte associations may add to mankind’s armory of bird-control methodology...|$|R

In particular, taking advantage of real-field audio record-ings collected in the Hymettus Mountains east of Athens, we investigate the ap-plicability of various machine learning techniques for the needs of our ABAD, which is intended to run on a mobile device. Performance is reported in terms of recognition accuracy on audio-frame level, due to the restrictions imposed by the requirement of run-time decision making with limited memory and energy resources. We report recognition accuracy of approximately 86 % on a frame level, which is quite promising and encourages further research efforts in that direction...|$|R
5|$|Conservationists {{are working}} with governments and {{fisheries}} {{in order to prevent}} further declines and increase populations of endangered procellariids. Progress has been made in protecting many colonies where most species are most vulnerable. On 20 June 2001, the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels was signed by seven major fishing nations. The agreement lays out a plan to manage fisheries by-catch, protect breeding sites, promote conservation in the industry, and research threatened species. The developing field of island restoration, where introduced species are removed and native species and habitats restored, has been used in several procellariid recovery programmes. Invasive species such as rats, feral cats and pigs have been either removed or controlled in many remote islands in the tropical Pacific (such as the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands), around New Zealand (where island restoration was developed), and in the south Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The grey-faced petrels of Whale Island (mentioned above) have been achieving much higher fledging successes after the introduced Norway rats were finally completely removed. At sea, procellariids threatened by long-line fisheries can be protected using techniques such as setting long-line bait at night, dying the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, increasing the amount of weight on lines and using <b>bird</b> <b>scarers</b> can all reduce the seabird by-catch. A further step towards conservation has been the signing of the 2001 treaty the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, which came into force in 2004 and has been ratified by eight countries, Australia, Ecuador, New Zealand, Spain, South Africa, France, Peru and the United Kingdom. The treaty requires these countries to take specific actions to reduce by-catch and pollution and to remove introduced species from nesting islands.|$|R

40|$|Ten {{years ago}} I waxed lyrical on the deep, {{indelible}} ties {{of the sounds}} of Dartmoor with its inhabitants (Drever 2002), betraying an inclination towards what Sterne’s has called the audio-visual litany (Sterne 2003). In this endeavour I added a sonic turn to Tuan’s concept of topophilia (Tuan 1974) : “fleeting visual pleasure; the sensual delight of physical contact; the fondness for place because it is familiar, because it is home and incarnates the past, because it evokes pride of ownership or of creation; joy in things because of animal health and vitality. " My notion of topophonophilia stressed the affirmative relationships between place, the sensation of sound and sentiment. Those of us who research and practice soundscapes, tacitly extol the positive attributes of sound and hearing with relation to space and place. We talk of how through sound we connect, locate, embody, discern and immerse. Through my recent research I am urged to propose that the opposite is also a reality: sound isolates, excludes, disconnects, disembodies and dislocates from the material and social world. Through {{a study of the}} impact of noise from high-speed hand dryers, my research uncovered a wide range of vulnerable groups that due to the sensitivity of their hearing or particular hearing requirements led to elevated anxiety, fear, pain and confusion and were in some cases exacerbating their social avoidance. These groups included infants; the elderly; partially sighted people; hearing aid users; and people with dementia, cerebral palsy, Ménière's disease, phonophobia, hyperacusis, or hyperacute hearing in the context of autism and Asperger's syndrome. In the case of autism exposure to noise can even lead to a shutdown. Following on from this study I came across an extensive range of environmental sounds that are causing suffering to these groups: <b>bird</b> <b>scarers,</b> mosquito alarm, classroom noise, traffic noise, waves on a beach and even the dawn chorus. With reference to Beethoven, Grandin, Canetti, Kafka and Noël Coward as well as new interview material, this paper will explore the sensory threshold shift of the sensitive hearer, and the sensitising of hearing, including the use of sonic thresholds to control subgroups. In conclusion, I propose a new paradigm for understanding hearing that extends from a medical classification of the otologically normal to a socio-cultural conception of the auraltypical. Within what I see as the hegemony of the auraltypical, I call for a new agenda of auraldiversity within acoustics and sound studies...|$|R
40|$|Feature {{extraction}} for <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Bird</b> Species Classification (ABSC) tasks {{has traditionally}} been based on parametric representations that were specifically developed for speech signals, such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). However, the discrimination capabilities of these features for ABSC could be enhanced by accounting for the vocal production mechanisms of birds, and, in particular, the spectro-temporal structure of bird sounds. In this paper, a new front-end for ABSC is proposed that incorporates this specific information through the non-negative decomposition of bird sound spectrograms. It consists of the following two different stages: short-time feature extraction and temporal feature integration. In the first stage, which aims at providing a better spectral representation of bird sounds on a frame-by-frame basis, two methods are evaluated. In the first method, cepstral-like features (NMF_CC) are extracted by using a filter bank that is automatically learned {{by means of the}} application of Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on bird audio spectrograms. In the second method, the features are directly derived from the activation coefficients of the spectrogram decomposition as performed through NMF (H_CC). The second stage summarizes the most relevant information contained in the short-time features by computing several statistical measures over long segments. The experiments show that the use of NMF_CC and H_CC in conjunction with temporal integration significantly improves the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) -based ABSC system with respect to conventional MFCC...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} will interrogate the mimetic faculty of modern Gaelic oral culture, focussing particularly on mimesis as an artistic device. The imitation {{of nature in}} Gaelic is perhaps most frequently associated with the folk-song tradition, in which non-lexical vocable refrains are frequently deployed {{for the purposes of}} emulating a particular sound quality pertinent to an individual species or natural phenomenon, such as the call of the seal or the breaking of waves. The most common of these, however, imitate birds. For the purposes of this analysis, imitation is understood to mean both the acoustic replication of a primary sound object (in this instance birdsong) or alternatively the figurative imitation of a given image implied by the use of metaphor. To this end, the present study will be divided into three sections, delineated in terms of genre. Chapters one and three will address the faculty of <b>acoustic</b> <b>bird</b> imitation, the former focusing on the sonance and semantics of mimetic children’s rhymes and the latter examining the use of voice in dialogue segments attributed to birds in traditional Gaelic storytelling. In addition, the second chapter will look at the bird metaphor and its deployment as a vehicle for both praise and vilification in Gaelic poetry, interrogating the semiotic meanings such associations invoke. In summation, it will be argued that the imitation of birds in Gaelic oral culture can be read in a wider context as a form of artistic escapism ‘in which the ordinary features of our world are brought into focus by a certain exaggeration … a framing of reality that announces that what is contained within the frame is not simply real’ (Davis, 1999 : 3) ...|$|R
