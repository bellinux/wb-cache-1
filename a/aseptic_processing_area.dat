40|$|Microbiological data {{analysis}} and trending in pharmaceutical cleanrooms is a legislative requirement, {{and part of}} quality assurance. It has historically been conducted using statistical tools, such as control charting, which lack the geographic component. Three years of environmental monitoring data from the cleanrooms of a pharmaceutical facility were analysed to find cleanrooms with microbiological percentage recovery rate hot spots {{in the air and}} surface of the facility. The data set was evaluated to determine if it has changed over the three year period using a χ 2 analysis. The cleanroom microflora was analysed to see if it differs among the different cleanroom grades, and potential contamination routes in the cleanrooms were ascertained. Given the lack of published studies that use GIS to perform spatial analysis of microbiological environmental monitoring data, this approach is novel. The research concluded that areas which are highly frequented by personnel (connection corridor, vial washing areas, documenting rooms, and air locks) have higher percentage recovery rates, and some are microbial hot spots. The microbiological percentage recovery rates from air and surface monitoring in some of these and other areas have improved over the three year period, while in some cleanroom areas they have not. The microbial percentage recovery rates from air monitoring have improved more than those from surface monitoring over the three year period. The percentage recovery rates in most cleanrooms, however, have remained stable over the three year period. The microbial distribution within Grade D and the <b>Aseptic</b> <b>Processing</b> <b>Area</b> (cleanroom grades A, A 2 and B) during the three year period is very similar in terms of microbial class distribution and microbial species identification. Grade D, however, has a higher percentage of moulds and a lower number of Gram-positive rods without spores compared with the <b>Aseptic</b> <b>Processing</b> <b>Area.</b> The material and personnel flow within the facility is responsible for the majority of microbiological contamination of the cleanrooms. This correlates with the findings of the literature review...|$|E

40|$|KUMAR, PRABHAT. <b>Aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> of a low-acid {{multiphase}} {{food product}} using a continuous flow microwave system. (Under {{the direction of}} K. P. Sandeep.) Continuous flow microwave heating is an emerging technology in the food industry with a potential to replace the conventional retort process for viscous and pumpable food products. <b>Aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> of a low-acid multiphase food product using continuous flow microwave heating system can combine the advantages of an aseptic process {{along with those of}} microwave heating. The main objective of this research was to develop a systematic approach for biological validation of <b>aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> of salsa con queso products using a continuous flow microwave system operating at 915 MHz. Dielectric properties of pumpable food products were measured by a new approach (under continuous flow conditions) and compared with the dielectric properties measured by the conventional approach (under static conditions). The results suggested that, for a multiphase product, dielectric properties measured under continuous flow conditions should be used for designing a continuous flow microwave heating system...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} <b>aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> {{originated}} {{to solve problems}} associated with conventional ‘in-container’ sterilization of foods such as low rate of heat penetration to the slowest heating point in the container, the long processing times required to deliver the required lethality, destruction of the nutritional and sensory characteristics of the food, low productivity, and high energy costs. <b>Aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> technique has been successfully applied to liquid foods and acid foods containing discrete particulates. However, the extension of <b>aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> to heterogeneous low-acid liquid foods containing discrete particulates has been difficult {{due to lack of}} data on critical factors such as interfacial heat transfer coefficient between the liquid and the particle as well as the residence time distribution (RDT) of particles in the holding tube of the aseptic system. Geometry of holding tube represents a primary parameter in determining the residence time distribution of particulate inside an <b>aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> system. Several configuration had been investigate in the past, including curved geometries in order to minimize spreading of RTD. In the following work an experimental bypass holding tube is optimized numerically and experimentally. Numerical optimization was performed by using the Optimal Shape Design, where the essential element respect to classical numerical simulations in fixed geometrical configurations, is to introduce a certain amount of geometrical degrees of freedom {{as a part of the}} unknowns, which means that the geometry is not completely defined, but part of it is allowed to move dynamically in order to minimize or maximize the objective function...|$|R

No significant differ-ence in springiness between g-KGM and g-SA from 40 C to 90 C and significant differences (p< 0. 05) between 100 C and 140 C were found.

50|$|There {{are also}} other devices, which can offer some helpful separation. These devices {{are known as}} Gloveboxes. Gloveboxes do not offer the separative control {{provisions}} of an isolator or RABS. Gloveboxes were originally designed for non-sterile product applications, such as weighing or manipulating a toxic drug and have a long track record for such non-sterile applications. Such gloveboxes can be very effective in preventing exposure of an operator to a toxic drug. In limited cases, {{they can also be}} used to protect a sterile product, when supplied with ISO 5 unidirectional air. However, in some notable cases, gloveboxes used for <b>aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> have provided no more sterile product protection than the traditional laminar air flow hood (LAF) design of the 1960s. In these cases, the glove boxes were problematic due to inappropriate design or controls (e.g., insufficient disinfection, transfer of contaminated materials, ingress of lower quality air into glovebox, poor design/integrity, poor transfers). However, if gloveboxes are very meticulously designed, thoroughly disinfected (e.g., using a sporadic) and carefully operated by well-trained <b>aseptic</b> <b>processing</b> personnel to prevent introduction of microbial contamination, it is possible to obtain some degree of increased sterile product protection versus the simple traditional LAF hood.|$|R

The fluid mechanics and the fluid residence time distribution (RTD), in the whole volume of the vessel and exclusively in the heating zone (between the electrodes), have been numerically simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (Fluent™) for a Newtonian (water) and a non-Newtonian fluid (strawberry pulp). These simulations were performed at different mass flow rates (from 0. 5 to 2 kg/min.) and different inlet temperatures (from 40 to 90 ºC). RTDs were determined defining a unit scalar at the inlet and monitoring its value at the outlet. These results allowed the construction of F-diagrams and the calculation of the hold back (H) and segregation (S). The simulations showed that for 0. 5 kg/min water induces the formation of more shortcuts (10 % higher H) then pulp. However, for 2 kg/min both fluids display a similar behaviour (less than 3 % difference between H values). Furthermore, RTD {{is affected by the}} inlet mass flow rate but not so significantly by process temperature.
