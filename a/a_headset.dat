5|$|In the air, {{there were}} also two {{competing}} designs, originating from groups of different backgrounds and needs. The Army Signal Corps, representing military aviators, preferred a solution based on a stream of audio navigation signals, constantly fed into the pilots' ears via <b>a</b> <b>headset.</b> Civilian pilots on the other hand, who were mostly airmail pilots flying cross-country to deliver the mail, felt the audio signals would be annoying and difficult to use over long flights, and preferred a visual solution, with an indicator in the instrument panel.|$|E

5000|$|The {{threadless}} <b>headset</b> is <b>a</b> {{more recent}} design. U.S. Patent 5095770 {{is owned by}} Cane Creek Cycling Components and expired on September 29, 2010. Headsets of this type are often referred to by the Dia-Compe (now Cane Creek) registered trademark [...] "Aheadset", and are manufactured under license.

Unlike <b>a</b> threaded <b>headset,</b> <b>a</b> threadless <b>headset</b> does not have <b>a</b> threaded top <b>headset</b> race or use a threaded steerer tube. Instead the steerer tube extends from the fork {{all the way through}} the head tube and above the headset, and is held in place by the stem clamped on top.|$|R
5|$|The iPad {{comes with}} several pre-installed applications, {{including}} Safari, Mail, Photos, Videos, YouTube, Music, iTunes, App Store, Maps, Notes, Calendar, Game Center, Photo Booth, and Contacts.

Although the tablet is not designed to make phone calls over a cellular network, users can use <b>a</b> <b>headset</b> or the built-in speaker and microphone and place phone calls over Wi-Fi or cellular using a VoIP application, such as Skype. The device has dictation, using the same voice recognition technology as the iPhone 4S.

25|$|MVMs debuted on January 25, 1999 and are {{now found}} in two models, both of which allow {{customers}} to purchase any type of MetroCard through a touchscreen. The machines also comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, through use of Braille and <b>a</b> <b>headset</b> jack: audible commands for each menu item are provided once <b>a</b> <b>headset</b> is connected and the proper sequence is keyed through the keypad; all non-visual commands are then entered via the keypad instead of the touchscreen.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>headset</b> is a {{headphone}} {{combined with}} a microphone. Headsets provide the equivalent functionality of a telephone handset with hands-free operation. They are used in call centers and by people in telephone-intensive jobs. The first-ever headset was invented in 1910, by a Stanford University student named Nathaniel Baldwin.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, a Japanese gadget project, neurowear, {{released}} Necomimi: <b>a</b> <b>headset</b> with motorized cat ears. The headset is a NeuroSky MindWave {{unit with}} two motors on the headband where a cat's ears might be. Slipcovers shaped like cat ears sit over the motors so {{that as the}} device registers emotional states the ears move to relate. For example, when relaxed, the ears fall to the sides and perk up when excited again.|$|E
25|$|However {{technology}} {{also allows}} for a multitude of smaller workstations in a classroom setting. Administrators network student workstations so that the instructor can launch individual scenarios at each station. Computer models are used to accurately simulate conditions such as wind, seas, and currents. Moreover, shallow-water effects or other hydrodynamic forces, such as ships passing close to each other, can also be depicted. A computer application records training sessions, complete with voice commands issued by the instructor which are received by the students via <b>a</b> <b>headset.</b>|$|E

Cordless bluetooth headsets are available, and often used with mobile telephones. Headsets are widely used for telephone-intensive jobs, in particular by call centre workers. They are also used by anyone wishing to hold telephone conversations with both hands free.|$|R
25|$|The {{survivors}} {{communicate by}} voice commands that are accessed by quick menus, and some may sound off automatically when performing actions such as reloading or spotting infected. Over 1,000 unique {{lines have been}} recorded for each survivor. Additional communication of player actions is conveyed through character lights. Also, weapon-mounted flashlights and muzzle flashes help the players in determining whether their companions are shooting, performing melee attacks, reloading or moving. Due to control issues {{and the likelihood of}} players using <b>a</b> <b>headset,</b> the Xbox 360 version of Left 4 Dead omits the quick phrases feature.|$|E
25|$|Starting with system {{software}} version 3.90, PSP-2000, PSP-3000 and PSP-N1000 {{can use the}} Skype VoIP service.

Due to hardware constraints, {{it is not possible to}} use the VoIP service on PSP-1000. The service allows Skype calls to be made over Wi-Fi and on the PSP Go over the Bluetooth Modem feature. Users must purchase Skype credit in order to make calls to non Skype devices such as a landline or mobile phone.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>headset</b> is a {{headphone}} {{combined with}} a microphone. Headsets provide the equivalent functionality of a telephone handset with hands-free operation. Among applications for headsets, besides telephone use, are aviation, theatre or television studio intercom systems, and console or PC gaming. Headsets are made with either a single-earpiece (mono) or a double-earpiece (mono to both ears or stereo). The microphone arm of headsets is either an external microphone type where the microphone is held {{in front of the}} user's mouth, or a voicetube type where the microphone is housed in the earpiece and speech reaches it by means of a hollow tube.|$|E

25|$|Ophthalmoscopy or fundus photography: Ophthalmoscopy is an {{examination}} of the retina in which the eye care professional: (1) looks through a slit lamp biomicroscope with a special magnifying lens that provides a narrow view of the retina, or (2) wearing <b>a</b> <b>headset</b> (indirect ophthalmoscope) with a bright light, looks through a special magnifying glass and gains a wide view of the retina. Hand-held ophthalmoscopy is insufficient to rule out significant and treatable diabetic retinopathy. Fundus photography generally captures considerably larger areas of the fundus, and has the advantage of photo documentation for future reference, as well as availing the image to be examined by a specialist at another location and/or time.|$|E
