5|$|The UCSC {{campus is}} also one of the few homes to Mima Mounds in the United States. They <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> rare in the United States and in the world in general.|$|E
5|$|The snout {{shape of}} {{crocodilians}} varies between species. Crocodiles may have either broad or slender snouts, while {{alligators and caimans}} have mostly broad ones. Gharials have snouts that <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> elongated. The muscles that close the jaws are much more massive and powerful than the ones that open them, and a crocodilian's jaws can be held shut by a person fairly easily. Conversely, the jaws <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> difficult to pry open. The powerful closing muscles attach at the median of portion of the lower jaw and the jaw hinge attaches to the atlanto-occipital joint, allowing the animal to open its mouth fairly wide.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{measurement}} technique is coherent, it naturally rejects incoherent radiation. Additionally, because the time slice of {{the measurement}} <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> narrow, the noise contribution to the measurement <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> low.|$|R
50|$|The Moulton {{notation}}, or Tongan notation <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> {{popular and}} <b>is</b> still cherished by the Tongans. It <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> common to see bandmasters writing out {{the music on}} the blackboards in the church halls during choir practices.|$|R
50|$|This {{activity}} <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> {{dangerous because}} optimum highmark terrain is typically {{in areas where}} avalanche danger <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> high. Snowmobilers <b>are</b> the recreation group {{most likely to be}} killed in an avalanche, largely due to the activity of highmarking.|$|R
5|$|A {{capacity}} for aggressive behavior {{should not be}} overstated with the giant otter. Researchers emphasize that even between groups, conflict avoidance is generally adopted. Within groups, the animals <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> peaceful and cooperative. Group hierarchies are not rigid and the animals easily share roles.|$|E
5|$|Adults <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> mobile {{during the}} day, and find refuge in resting sites in flowers and young leaves {{at night and}} early morning. They migrate from crop to crop {{following}} flower availability. Field density can vary. In France, numbers are around 20 adults/100 plants {{at the beginning of}} the colonization and 150 adults/100 plants at population peak when pressure is high.|$|E
5|$|Although corals first {{appeared}} in the Cambrian period, some , fossils <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> rare until the Ordovician period, 100 million years later, when rugose and tabulate corals became widespread. Paleozoic corals often contained numerous endobiotic symbionts.|$|E
5000|$|... "My father’s {{position}} <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> good, Sinlung’s position <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> good; We showed our prime life in Shan, Tuaichongi {{brought the}} head of enemies; As foretold by the eagle’s claws, At Zainghong we showed our ability to our foes." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Climate <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> [...] "continental". Temperatures in the Gobi {{can fall}} to -40 °C {{in winter and}} rise to +40 °C in the summer. With an average yearly {{rainfall}} of about 100 mm, the climate <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> arid.|$|R
50|$|Fluoroacetate <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> toxic.|$|R
5|$|As B.menziesii is not {{similar to}} any other Banksia, hybrids are {{unlikely}} to occur. The only reported hybrid is a sterile hybrid with B.hookeriana (Hooker's banksia), found north of Badgingarra by Greg Keighery. Manual cross-fertilisation with B.attenuata has resulted in germination, indicating that these two species are genetically compatible, but natural hybrids <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> unlikely because the two species flower at different times.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens have coexisted {{with humans}} for {{thousands}} of years and in some areas have been so numerous that people have regarded them as pests. Part of their success as a species is due to their omnivorous diet; they <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on carrion, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, and food waste.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{symptoms}} of poisoning appear within {{three hours of}} ingestion of the mushroom as visual hallucinations, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, irregular and slow heart beat and agitation. Severe cases involving coma, convulsions, or death <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> rare.|$|E

5|$|Golden jackals <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> {{harmful to}} {{fur-bearing}} rodents, such as coypu and muskrats. Coypu can be completely extirpated {{in shallow water}} bodies. During 1948–1949 in the Amu Darya, muskrats constituted 12.3% of jackal faecal contents, and 71% of muskrat houses were destroyed by jackals. Jackals also harm the fur industry by eating muskrats caught in traps or taking skins left out to dry.|$|E
5|$|In {{almost all}} cases, {{symptoms}} resolve within a week. Fatalities <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> unlikely. No deaths {{have been reported}} since the introduction of antivenom in 1956. Before this, redback spider bites had been implicated in at least 14 deaths in Australia, however these cases cannot be definitively linked to the Redback bite as the sole cause.|$|E
5|$|In principle, the {{simultaneous}} occurrence of a Solar eclipse and a transit {{of a planet}} is possible. But these events <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> rare because of their short durations. The next anticipated simultaneous occurrence of a Solar eclipse and a transit of Mercury will be on July 5, 6757, and a Solar eclipse and a transit of Venus is expected on April 5, 15232.|$|E

5|$|Loons are aquatic {{birds that}} are {{the size of a}} large duck, to which they are unrelated. Their plumage is largely gray or black, and they have spear-shaped bills. Loons swim well and fly adequately, but, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body, <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> poor at walking. Three species have been {{recorded}} in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of the notch, the Wildcat Range is a popular objective. The five summits can be reached via the Wildcat Ridge Trail; the first two miles <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> difficult, and require skill on short, yet exposed, rock scrambles. This part of the trail is {{frequently}} bypassed by following the ski area's Polecat Trail to the summit of DPeak.|$|E
5|$|Prion {{aggregates}} <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> {{stable and}} accumulate in infected tissue, causing tissue damage and cell death. This structural stability means that prions {{are resistant to}} denaturation by chemical and physical agents, making disposal and containment of these particles difficult. Prion structure varies slightly between species, but nonetheless prion replication is subject to epimutation and natural selection just like other forms of replication.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{expeditions to}} Davidson {{have focused on}} its ecology, and {{specifically}} on the variety of deep-sea corals, some over 100 years old, that live on its banks. These large colonies <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> fragile to human interaction. Davidson's proximity to scientific research institutions has helped its exploration, as multiple dives, mappings, and studies have made {{it one of the}} better-studied seamounts in the world.|$|E
5|$|Some American {{alligators}} {{are missing}} an inhibited gene for melanin, {{which makes them}} albino. These American alligators <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> rare and almost impossible {{to find in the}} wild. They could only survive in captivity, as they are very vulnerable to the sun and predators.|$|E
5|$|The best-known {{method of}} prey capture is {{by means of}} sticky webs. Varying {{placement}} of webs allows different species of spider to trap different insects in the same area, for example flat horizontal webs trap insects that fly up from vegetation underneath while flat vertical webs trap insects in horizontal flight. Web-building spiders have poor vision, but <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> sensitive to vibrations.|$|E
