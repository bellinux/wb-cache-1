25|$|A boat-trip {{along the}} Luwomwba River, {{or any other}} major river in the park may reveal Pel’s fishing owl, <b>African</b> <b>finfoot,</b> half-collared kingfisher, Ross’ turaco and Böhm’s bee-eater. The vast {{wetlands}} of Kasanka support some species not easily seen elsewhere such as rufous-bellied heron, lesser jacana and African pygmy goose. The shoebill was confirmed {{for the first time}} in 20 years at the end of 2010 and a breeding pair of wattled cranes and their offspring are often encountered. Marsh tchagra, coppery-tailed coucal, Fulleborn's longclaw, locustfinch, pale-crowned, croaking and short-winged cisticola, chestnut-headed and streaky-breasted flufftail, harlequin and blue quail, black-rumped buttonquail and fawn-breasted waxbill are amongst the other specials on the wetland fringes and in the large dambo’s.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>finfoot</b> {{belongs to}} a family, Heliornithidae, whose only other members are the masked finfoot and the sungrebe. Their {{relationships}} between this family and other birds are poorly understood.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>finfoot</b> (Podica senegalensis) is an {{aquatic bird}} {{from the family}} Heliornithidae (the finfoots and sungrebe). The species lives in the rivers and lakes of western, central, and {{southern}} Africa.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>finfoot's</b> {{conservation}} status {{is hard to}} determine, given its elusive nature. It is not considered threatened, as it is not persecuted or targeted by hunters, and while scarce, it is very widespread. However, there is concern that it may become threatened, as wetlands are cleared and watercourses altered and polluted. It is also thought to tolerate only minimal disturbance. This and increased habitat fragmentation mean that the species needs to be monitored to safeguard it. There are currently no <b>African</b> <b>finfoots</b> in captivity.|$|R
50|$|There {{are usually}} {{two to four}} eggs in a clutch, all with a white base color that is {{consistently}} covered in brown and pale purple spots. The eggs hatch after an unusually short incubation period of only 10 to 11 days. Both sexes share a responsibility in the incubation of the eggs; the female sits on the nest {{for most of the}} daylight hours and throughout the night, while male incubates them during the middle part of the day. Unlike their close relatives, the <b>African</b> and masked <b>finfoot,</b> the sungrebe chicks are hatched with only sparse down and poorly matured feet and bill. The chicks hatch naked, blind, and defenseless.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>finfoot</b> can {{be found}} in a range of {{habitats}} across Africa, where there are rivers, streams and lakes with good cover on the banks. This range includes forest, wooded savannah, flooded forest, and even mangrove swamps.|$|E
50|$|All {{three species}} tend to breed after the wet season, the exact timing {{of which is}} {{dependent}} on the local climate. The breeding behaviour of the masked finfoot is almost entirely unknown. All three species exhibit some changes in appearance prior to breeding - masked finfoots develop a fleshy knob above the bill, and the plumage of the male <b>African</b> <b>finfoot</b> and female sungrebe also change. There is considerable variation within the finfoots on several aspects of breeding; in the Sungrebe the nest building and incubation duties are shared between the sexes, in the <b>African</b> <b>finfoot</b> the female alone incubates. The nests of all finfoots are untidy bowls of sticks, twigs, and reeds suspended in vegetation above water.|$|E
50|$|Over 400 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} within the Zambezi National Park. Pel's fishing owl, African skimmer, collared palm thrush, lanner falcon, goliath heron, <b>African</b> <b>finfoot,</b> rock pratincole and long-toed lapwing {{are considered to be}} among the speciality birds of the park.|$|E
50|$|It is {{the only}} member of the genus Heliornis. The Heliornithidae family, to which it belongs, {{contains}} just two other species: the <b>African</b> <b>finfoot,</b> Podica senegalensis, and the masked finfootHeliopais personatus, which breeds in eastern India down through southeast Asia to the Wallace Line.|$|E
50|$|Kyambura is {{the only}} place in QENP where habituated {{chimpanzees}} and other types of primates including red-tailed monkey, black-and-white colobus, baboons and vervet monkeys are seen. The park is also known for its variety of avian species including various falcons, the blue-headed bee-eater and the <b>African</b> <b>finfoot.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>finfoot</b> is an {{underwater}} specialist {{with a long}} neck, a striking sharp beak, and bright red, lobed feet. The plumage varies by race, generally pale underneath and darker on top. The males are usually darker than the females. It superficially resembles South America's torrent duck.|$|E
50|$|The masked finfoot or Asian finfoot (Heliopais personatus) is an {{aquatic bird}} from the fresh and {{brackish}} wetlands {{of the eastern}} Indian subcontinent, Indochina, Malaysia and Indonesia. Like {{the rest of the}} family, the <b>African</b> <b>finfoot</b> and the sungrebe, the relationship to other birds is poorly understood.|$|E
50|$|The dam and its {{surrounds}} support over 350 {{bird species}} which includes rarities such as African broadbill, saddle-billed and yellow-billed storks, <b>African</b> <b>finfoot,</b> Pel's fishing owl and Narina trogon. The dam also supports a breeding colony of pink-backed and great white pelicans. Additionally the dam supports a stable population of Nile crocodiles.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} species. The <b>African</b> <b>finfoot</b> {{is found in}} {{tropical}} Africa on streams in woodland. The masked finfoot has a scattered distribution from Eastern India down through southeast Asia to the Wallace Line. The sungrebe is found in tropical Central and South America. Finfoots are highly secretive and many aspects of their biology are unknown to science.|$|E
50|$|African {{fish eagle}} and <b>African</b> <b>finfoot</b> are found along the Blyde River. The lowveld {{woodlands}} harbour purple-crested lourie, emerald cuckoo, red-backed mannikin, golden-tailed woodpecker, gorgeous bushshrike, white-faced owl {{and a number}} of raptors like white-backed vulture, gymnogene, black-chested snake eagle, Wahlberg's eagle and long-crested eagle. A number of raptors frequent the mountains and cliffs, including cape vulture, black eagle, jackal buzzard, peregrine falcon, lanner falcon and rock kestrel.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA fossil humerus {{from the}} hominid {{fossiliferous}} area of Toros Menalla (ca 7 Ma, Chad, Africa) {{belongs to the}} Heliornithidae (Aves, Gruiformes). It is the second documented fossil record for the family, and {{the first in the}} Old World. It is compared with all the living species: the Sungrebe (Heliornis fulica), the Masked Finfoot (Heliopais personata) and the <b>African</b> <b>Finfoot</b> (Podica senegalensis). It belongs to the genus Heliopais, and is very similar to the only species H. personata. The Masked Finfoot appears to have evolved little morphologically since the Miocene. This poorly known and threatened genus and species is today confined to tropical South-East Asia. Its presence in the Late Miocene of Chad is a further Asian element in the late Neogene African avifaunas. Today the distribution of Heliopais is highly relictual, and some Heliornithidae will certainly be encountered in the Paleogene and the Miocene deposits of the Palearctic region. The <b>African</b> <b>Finfoot</b> is today the Heliornithidae geographically the closest to the site area, and occurs in forested regions south of the Sahelian area. Apparently, this genus was already absent further north, where the Asian genus was present, in the Late Neogene. Palaeoecologically, the presence of this Heliornithidae is indicative for Toros Menalla of a freshwater body with thick overhanging vegetation, and partly forested edges. This kind of precise indication about a component of the palaeoenvironment is critical for the study of hominid sites and early hominid evolution. A growing number of fossil birds from African hominid localities is yielding important clues regarding biogeography and environment...|$|E
40|$|Water {{hyacinth}} infestations on the Nseleni/Mposa River {{system were}} sprayed with a herbicide on {{an ad hoc}} basis between 1983 and 1995, with no real results being achieved. During the summer of 1985 – 86, the first biological control agent, the weevil Neochetina eichhorniae, was introduced into the system, {{and by the end}} of 1986 beetle activity, estimated by adult feeding scars, was common throughout. During 1995, a formal Integrated Water Hyacinth Control Programme was introduced to form a holistic approach to use the various control options that were available; i. e. chemical, mechanical and biological. A committee comprising all parties/communities adjacent to the rivers and lake that were affected by the water hyacinth was formed to monitor the new integrated control program. The program consists of four main components, namely: Survey, Plan, Control and Record. The Nseleni River (17. 1 km affected), Mposa River (4. 9 km affected) and Lake Nsezi (≈ 260 ha) have been divided into eight management units. By using the integrated control approach, a total of 18. 9 km of river has been cleared of water hyacinth between 1995 and the present. The management units that have been cleared of water hyacinth, now require only occasional follow-ups to spray any regrowth with a herbicide or to physically remove it. Recent records indicate that previously recorded ‘red data ’ species of avifauna have returned to the area, namely bitterns (vulnerable and rare), storks (rare) and <b>African</b> <b>finfoot</b> (indeterminate). Oral reports from the local rural communities that rely on fish as a source of food, indicate that their catches have improved—a sure sign that the control of water hyacinth in the system is having a positive ecological impact. Also of importance is the fact that there is reduced evapotranspiration because of removal of water hyacinth, which in turn makes more water available to the environment, industry and the surrounding communities, both rural and urban. The rural communities have benefited directly, as they are now able to fish and thereby feed their families. As a result of the success of this control program, the entire catchments of the Mposa River (Mbabe and Nyokaneni rivers) have been included in the program. WATER hyacinth was first recorded in South Afric...|$|E
