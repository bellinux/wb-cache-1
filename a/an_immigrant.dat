40|$|One Perspective is {{an essay}} film that investigates notions {{of home and}} {{identity}} from <b>an</b> <b>immigrant’s</b> perspective. The project explores how an essayistic film {{can be used to}} examine the in-between, intricate and chaotic space an individual is positioned in, as they attempt to negotiate and reconcile two different cultures. An investigation of the subjects of diaspora and <b>an</b> <b>immigrant’s</b> sense of identity and home, form the underpinnings of this project. It questions how an autoethnographic enquiry be implied in an essay film to investigate notions of home as it relates to <b>an</b> <b>immigrants</b> experience. Using autoethnography as the methodological framework, the ‘I’ is made the subject of research in an effort to articulate a personal narrative of travelling through cultural paradigms. This project draws inspiration from films such as San Soleil and Night and Fog, to understand the complexities of portraying an essayistic formatted film. I aim to initiate a conversation with viewers to reflect upon their own narrative...|$|R

In 1916, an unaccredited Russian Women's College was established in Brooklyn. <b>An</b> <b>immigrant</b> society and orphanage also were established, as well as the first Orthodox monasteries in the United States (Saint Tikhon's Monastery for men in 1905 and Holy Virgin Protection for women in 1915).|$|E

5|$|The three paleontologists Xiaoming Wang, Richard H. Tedford, and Ronald M. Nowak have {{proposed}} that C.dirus evolved from Canis armbrusteri, with Nowak stating that specimens found in Cumberland Cave, Maryland, appear to be C.armbrusteri diverging into C.dirus. The early wolf from China, Canis chihliensis, {{may have been the}} ancestor of both C.armbrusteri and the gray wolf C.lupus. The sudden appearance of C.armbrusteri in North America during the Early Pleistocene suggests that this was <b>an</b> <b>immigrant</b> from Asia, as was C.lupus later in the Pleistocene. In 2010 Francisco Prevosti proposed that C.dirus was a sister taxon to C.lupus.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Carnegie, <b>an</b> <b>immigrant</b> from Scotland, {{a former}} Pennsylvania Railroad {{executive}} turned steel magnate, founded the Carnegie Steel Company. He proceeded {{to play a}} key role in the development of the U.S. steel industry. He became a philanthropist: in 1890, he established the first Carnegie Library, in a program to establish libraries in numerous cities and towns by the incentive of matching funds. In 1895, he founded the Carnegie Institute. In 1901, as the U.S. Steel Corporation formed, he sold his mills to J.P. Morgan for $250 million, making him one of the world's richest men. Carnegie once wrote that a man who dies rich, dies disgraced. He devoted the rest of his life to public service, establishing libraries, trusts, and foundations. In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.|$|E
5|$|Argentodites is a {{possible}} multituberculate mammal from the Cretaceous of Argentina. The single species, Argentodites coloniensis, is known from a single blade-like fourth lower premolar (p4) from the La Colonia Formation, which is mostly or entirely Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous) in age. The p4 is 4.15mm long and bears eight cusps on its upper margin and long associated ridges on both sides. The enamel consists of prisms that are completely or partly surrounded by a sheath and that are on average 6.57m apart. Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska, who described and named the fossil in 2007, regarded it as a multituberculate, perhaps a cimolodontan—and thus, {{a member of a}} mostly Laurasian (northern) group and <b>an</b> <b>immigrant</b> to Argentina from North America—on the basis of the shape of the tooth and features of its enamel. In 2009, however, two teams argued that Argentodites may in fact be close to or identical with Ferugliotherium, a member of the small Gondwanan (southern) group Gondwanatheria; although their relationships are disputed, gondwanatheres may themselves be multituberculates.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of the predicted earnings differential between self-employment and wage-employment on self-employment propensities among immigrants in Sweden. Immigrants from non-European countries have essentially lower earnings from self-employment and wage-employment than immigrants from European countries. It is found that the difference between <b>an</b> <b>immigrant's</b> predicted earnings in self- and wage-employment has a strong influence on <b>an</b> <b>immigrant's</b> self-employment decision. <b>A</b> one unit increase in the log differential between self-employment and wage-employment earnings increase the self-employment rate among immigrants by about 5 percentage points, suggesting that discriminatory wages in the wage-employment sector may push immigrants towards self-employment. ...|$|R

5|$|By {{the late}} Maastrichtian, albertosaurines {{appear to have}} gone extinct, while the tyrannosaurine Tyrannosaurus roamed from Saskatchewan to Texas. This pattern is {{mirrored}} in other North American dinosaur taxa. During the Campanian and early Maastrichtian, lambeosaurine hadrosaurs and centrosaurine ceratopsians are common in the northwest, while hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines were more common to the south. By {{the end of the}} Cretaceous, centrosaurines are unknown and lambeosaurines are rare, while hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines were common throughout the Western Interior. A study published in the journal Scientific Reports on February 2, 2016 by Steve Brusatte, Thomas Carr et al. indicates that during the later Maastrichtian, Tyrannosaurus itself might have been partially responsible for the extinction of the other tyrannosaurids in most of western North America. The study indicates that Tyrannosaurus might have been <b>an</b> <b>immigrant</b> from Asia as opposed to having evolved in North America (possibly a descendent of the closely related Tarbosaurus) that supplanted and outcompeted other tyrannosaurids. This theory is further supported by the fact that few to no other types of tyrannosaurid are found within Tyrannosaurus known range.|$|E
5|$|Georges, the {{youngest}} of eight children, was born on , 1887, in Chicoutimi, Quebec, to Jacques Vézina, a local baker and <b>an</b> <b>immigrant</b> from St. Nicolas de La Rochelle in France, and his wife Clara. Georges attended school at the Petit Séminaire de Chicoutimi {{until the age of}} fourteen, when he left the school to help at his father's bakery. He played hockey from a young age, participating in informal street hockey matches with others his own age. Vézina partook in these matches in his shoes, and used skates {{for the first time at}} age 16 when he joined the local team in Chicoutimi. As Chicoutimi was in a remote area of Quebec, more than 200 kilometres from Quebec City, the hockey club was not in any organised league. Rather the club, known as the Saguenéens ("People from the Saguenay", the region where Chicoutimi is located), toured the province, playing exhibition games against a variety of clubs.|$|E
