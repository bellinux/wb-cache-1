40|$|The charge {{exchange}} cross sections for protons and various alkali atoms are calculated using the classical approximation of Gryzinski. It {{is assumed that}} the hydrogen atoms resulting from {{charge exchange}} exist in all possible excited states. Charge transfer collisions between protons and potassium as well as protons and sodium atoms are studied. The energy range investigated is between 4 and 30 keV. The theoretical calculations of the capture cross section and the cross section {{for the creation of}} metastable 2 S hydrogen are compared to experimental values. Good quantitative agreement is found for the capture cross section but only qualitative agreement for the metastable cross section. Analysis of the Lyman <b>alpha</b> <b>window</b> in molecular oxygen suggests that measured values of the metastable cross section may be in error. Thick alkali target data are also presented. This allows the determination of the total electron loss cross section. Finally, some work was done with H 2 (+) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Estimation of radon risk in soil gas is a {{preventive}} practice when building safe dwellings. We propose {{a method for}} measuring of 222 Rn in soil gas based on liquid scintillation counting (LSC). A small-diameter hollow steel probe with a sharpened lower-end tip combined with a large-volume syringe (RADON v. o. s., Czech Republic) {{is used as a}} soil gas sampling system. One measurement approach includes direct soil gas counting in a special LS vial coated inside with plastic scintillation material, MeltilexTM. Another approach is about 10 times more sensitive. It includes a radon trap-glass bubbler filled with a 20 -mL portion of a toluene-based LS cocktail. After sampling, the LS solution is transferred into conventional vials for LS counting. The air inside the 150 -mL syringe in both cases is blown through a vial or a bubbler. In the bubbler method, 3 portions of the air syringe volume are blown through the bubbler to make the method more reproducible. Rn sorp-tion in the trap depends on the toluene and bubbler volumes, temperature, and humidity. In both measurement approaches, modern LSC measurement equipment with alpha/beta separation is used. The method was tested on Quantulus 1220 TM and Triathler LS spectrometers. The described measurement approaches yielded count rates in the <b>alpha</b> <b>window</b> of 2. 4 cpm for direct counting in Meltilex-coated vials and ~ 24 cpm when Rn is trapped in toluene, both corresponding to a concentration of 1 kBq m− 3 for Rn in soil gas...|$|E

Prices were quite low, such {{that for the}} first time many enthusiasts and hobbyists could afford an Alpha AXP-based computer. The Multia or UDB can run <b>Windows</b> NT for <b>Alpha</b> through <b>Windows</b> NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 (although Windows 2000 was never officially released for the <b>Alpha</b> platform, <b>Windows</b> 2000 Beta was released and in fact runs on the Multia), and both Linux and NetBSD are available for the Multia. Additionally, both Digital UNIX and OpenVMS can be configured to run on the Multia (with certain limitations), although initially such operating systems were disabled from running on the budget Multia line.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{calibration}} of the alpha/beta {{liquid scintillation}} (LS) spectrometric measurement is rather complicated for samples having variable chemical and radionuclide compositions if rather accurate results are required. Variable quenching {{can be a}} significant source of uncertainty if it is not considered in the calibrations because variable quenching affects alpha and beta spillovers, the optimum pulse-shape analyzer (PSA), and alpha and beta backgrounds. It is known that the beta spill-over to the <b>alpha</b> <b>window</b> also depends on the energy of the beta particle, but until now it has been assumed that the alpha spill-over to the beta window does not depend on the energy of the alpha particle. The present study demonstrates that the alpha spillover depends also on the energy of the alpha particle. The alpha spillover of lower energy alpha particles is larger than the spillover of higher energy alpha particles when the sample is measured at a constant PSA. This is established by preparing sample series from radon-bearing water, quenching some samples to different degrees, and measuring the samples at various PSA levels. The large energy difference between radon and its alpha-emitting daughters, 218 Po and 214 Po, allows one to see the dependence of alpha spillover on the alpha energy. The significance of the new finding is evaluated with a few examples of determinations of uranium and radium in groundwater samples. The too-low uranium results by alpha/beta LS spectrom-etry can be partly explained by increased quenching when the samples are measured at the PSA level set according to an unquenched sample. Because of the low alpha particle energies of uranium isotopes, their alpha spillovers to the beta window are clearly larger for quenched samples than the spillovers of 222 Rn, 218 Po, and 214 Po...|$|E

The translator provides native Alpha code for the portions of an x 86 application which have been previously executed.

A simulation experiment is realized to test the effectiveness of heuristics regarding the lower bound.

40|$|Computer systems pervade {{every aspect}} of the DIII-D National Fusion Research program. This {{includes}} real-time systems acquiring experimental data from data acquisition hardware; cpu server systems performing short term and long term data analysis; desktop activities such as word processing, spreadsheets, and scientific paper publication; and systems providing mechanisms for remote collaboration. The DIII-D network ties all of these systems together and connects to the ESNET wide area network. This paper will give an overview of these systems, including their purposes and functionality and how they connect to other systems. Computer systems include seven different types of UNIX systems (HP-UX, REALIX, SunOS, Solaris, Digital UNIX, Ultrix, and IRIX), OpenVMS systems (both BAX and <b>Alpha),</b> MACintosh, <b>Windows</b> 95, and more recently Windows NT systems. Most of the network internally is ethernet with some use of FDDI. A T 3 link connects to ESNET and thus to the Internet. Recent upgrades to the network have notably improved its efficiency, but the demand for bandwidth is ever increasing. By means of software and mechanisms still in development, computer systems at remote sites are playing an increasing role both in accessing and analyzing data and even participating in certain controlling aspects for the experiment. The advent of audio/video over the interest is now presenting a new means for remote sites to participate in the DIII-D program...|$|R
40|$|We studied {{two aspects}} of the {{performance}} of Windows NT tm : processor bandwidth requirements for memory accesses in a uniprocessor system running commercial and benchmark applications, and locking behavior of a commercial database on a small-scale multiprocessor. Our studies are based on full dynamic execution traces of the systems, which include all instructions executed by the operating system and applications over periods of a few seconds (enough time to allow for significant computation). The traces were obtained on Alpha PCs, using a new software tool called PatchWrx that takes advantage of the Alpha architecture's PAL-code layer to implement efficient, comprehensive system tracing. Because the <b>Alpha</b> version of <b>Windows</b> NT uses substantially the same code base as other versions, and therefore executes nearly the same sequence of calls, basic blocks, and data structure accesses, we believe our conclusions are relevant for non-Alpha systems as well.

5000|$|Early fansubs were {{produced}} using analog video editing equipment. First, {{a copy of}} the original source material or raw was obtained, most commonly from a commercial laserdisc. VHS tapes or even a homemade recording could be used as well, though that would entail a lower quality finished product. The dialogue was then translated into a script, that was then timed to match the dialogue, and typeset for appearance. The two most popular programs used in this process were JACOsub for the Commodore Amiga and Substation <b>Alpha</b> for MS <b>Windows.</b> The next step was to produce one or more masters, a high quality copy of the finished fansub from which many distribution copies could be made. The fansubber would play back the raw video through a computer equipped with a genlock in order to generate the subtitles and then overlay them on the raw signal. The hardware of choice was an Amiga PC as most professional genlocks were extraordinarily expensive. The final output of this arrangement was then recorded. The master was most often recorded onto S-VHS tape in an attempt to maximize quality, though some fansubbers were forced to use inferior but less expensive VHS or Beta. Once completed, the master copy was then sent to a distributor.|$|R
40|$|Combined EEG-fMRI {{analysis}} correlates time courses from single electrodes {{or independent}} EEG components with the hemodynamic response. Implementing information from only one electrode, however, may miss relevant information from complex electrophysiological networks. Component based analysis, in turn, {{depends on a}} priori knowledge of the signal topography. Complex designs such as studies on multisensory integration of emotions investigate subtle differences in distributed networks based on only a few trials per condition. Thus, they require a sensitive and comprehensive approach which does not rely on a-priori knowledge about the underlying neural processes. In this pilot study, feasibility and sensitivity of source localization-driven analysis for EEG-fMRI was tested using a multisensory integration paradigm. Dynamic audiovisual stimuli consisting of emotional talking faces and pseudowords with emotional prosody were rated in a delayed response task. The trials comprised affectively congruent and incongruent displays. In addition to event-locked EEG and fMRI analyses, induced oscillatory EEG responses at estimated cortical sources and in specific temporo-spectral windows were correlated with the corresponding BOLD responses. EEG analysis showed high data quality with less than 10 % trial rejection. In an early time <b>window,</b> <b>alpha</b> oscillations were suppressed in bilateral occipital cortices and fMRI analysis confirmed high data quality with reliable activation in auditory, visual and frontal areas to the presentation of multisensory stimuli. In line with previous studies, we obtained reliable correlation patterns for event locked occipital alpha suppression and BOLD signal time course. Our results suggest a valid methodological approach to investigate complex stimuli using the present source localization driven method for EEG-fMRI. This novel procedure may help to investigate combined EEG-fMRI data from novel complex paradigms with high spatial and temporal resolution...|$|R
