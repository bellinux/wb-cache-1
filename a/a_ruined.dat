Collapsed stones on the northeastern end of the chamber probably represented a stone chamber in which human remains might have been deposited; none, however, have been discovered.|$|E

They got to chose between which of the two coasters they would like to experience. The blue coaster was named Ice and the other Red coaster was named Fire.|$|E
5|$|Etal Castle is <b>a</b> <b>ruined</b> medieval {{fortification}} in {{the village}} of Etal, Northumberland, England. It was built around 1341 by Robert Manners, and comprised a residential tower, a gatehouse and a corner tower, protected by a curtain wall. The castle was involved both in local feuding and the border wars between England and Scotland. There was a battle between the rival Manners and Heron families outside the walls in 1428, and in 1513 it was briefly captured by King James IV of Scotland during his invasion of England.|$|E
5|$|Gisborough Priory is characterised {{by a few}} {{highly visible}} remains. The priory church survives in a fragmentary state, {{dominated}} by the east wall of the presbytery that stands to its full height. Several of the priory church's column bases can also be seen, as can a number of excavated graves within the presbytery. Elsewhere on the site, {{the outline of the}} cloister is visible but is largely unexcavated, while the ruins of the west (or cellarer's) range constitutes the largest area of other remains above ground. <b>A</b> <b>ruined</b> gatehouse and a still-intact dovecote (the latter off-limits to visitors) stand on the western edges of the site.|$|E

5|$|Loughor Castle is <b>a</b> <b>ruined,</b> medieval {{fortification}} {{located in}} the town of Loughor, Wales. The castle was built around 1106 by the Anglo-Norman lord Henry de Beaumont, during the Norman invasion of Wales. The site overlooked the River Loughor and controlled a strategic road and ford running across the Gower Peninsula. The castle was designed as an oval ringwork, probably topped by wicker fence defences, and reused the remains of the former Roman fort of Leucarum.|$|E
5|$|Oliver's Battery is <b>a</b> <b>ruined</b> {{artillery}} battery on {{the island}} of Tresco in the Isles of Scilly. It was built by the Parliamentarian admiral, Sir Robert Blake, after he invaded Tresco in April 1651 during the years of the interregnum. It was used to bombard the neighbouring island of St Mary's, which was still held by an opposing Royalist army, and forced its surrender several weeks later. The battery comprised a triangle of ramparts, constructed using earth and rubble, which, combined with the natural stone features on the site, produced a substantial, if crude, fortification. It is now ruined, and owned by the Duchy of Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|Pennard Castle is <b>a</b> <b>ruined</b> castle, {{near the}} modern village of Pennard on the Gower Peninsula, in south Wales. The castle {{was built in}} the early 12th century as a timber ringwork {{following}} the Norman invasion of Wales. The walls were rebuilt in stone by the Braose family {{at the turn of the}} 13th and 14th centuries, including a stone gatehouse. Soon afterwards, however, encroaching sand dunes caused the site to be abandoned and it fell into ruin. Restoration work was carried out during the course of the 20th century and the remains of the castle are now protected under UK law as a Grade II* listed building.|$|E

5|$|Peveril Castle (also Castleton Castle or Peak Castle) is <b>a</b> <b>ruined</b> 11th-century castle {{overlooking}} {{the village of}} Castleton in the English county of Derbyshire. It was the main settlement (or caput) of the feudal barony of William Peverel, known as the Honour of Peverel, and was founded some time between the Norman Conquest of 1066 and its first recorded mention in the Domesday Survey of 1086, by Peverel, who held lands in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire as a tenant-in-chief of the king. The town became the economic centre of the barony. The castle has views across the Hope Valley and Cave Dale.|$|E
5|$|Ruisdael's first Scandinavian views contain big firs, rugged mountains, large {{boulders}} and rushing torrents. Though convincingly realistic, {{they are based}} on previous art works, rather than on direct experience. There is no record that Ruisdael made any trip to Scandinavia, although fellow Haarlem painter van Everdingen had travelled there in 1644 and had popularised the subgenre. Ruisdael's work soon outstripped van Everdingen's finest efforts. In total Ruisdael produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls, of which Waterfall in a Mountainous Landscape with <b>a</b> <b>Ruined</b> Castle, 1665–1670, is seen as his greatest by Slive.|$|E

Its ownership is uncertain and may be attributable to pharaoh Khaba. The pyramid architecture, however, {{is very similar to}} that of the Buried Pyramid of king Sekhemkhet and for this reason is firmly datable to the 3rd Dynasty.|$|E
