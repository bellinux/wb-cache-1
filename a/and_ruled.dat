5|$|The {{origin of}} the {{political}} division is unknown. It might have happened {{at the beginning of}} Peribsen's rule or shortly before. Because Peribsen chose the deity Seth as his new throne patron, Egyptologists are of the view that Peribsen was a chieftain from Thinis or a prince of the Thinite royal house. This theory is based on Seth being a deity of Thinite origin, which would explain Peribsen's choice: his name changing may have been nothing more than smart political (and religious) propaganda. Peribsen is thought to have gained the Thinite throne <b>and</b> <b>ruled</b> only Upper Egypt, whilst other rulers held the Memphite throne <b>and</b> <b>ruled</b> Lower Egypt.|$|E

During this period (1247), a Malay chieftain from Tambralinga in modern Thailand named Chandrabhanu invaded the politically fragmented island.

Famed for his piety and his remarkably mild and just reign, John was an exceptional example of a moral ruler at a time when cruelty was the norm. For this reason, he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius.|$|E

Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E

The earliest known settlement in the vicinity was Tell Abu Hawam, a small port city established in the Late Bronze Age (14th century BCE). In the 3rd century CE, Haifa was known as a dye-making center. Over the centuries, the city has changed hands: being conquered <b>and</b> <b>ruled</b> by the Phoenicians, Persians, Hasmoneans, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Crusaders, Ottomans, British, and the Israelis. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the Haifa Municipality has governed the city.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{a hybrid}} of Boyer Moore <b>and</b> <b>Rule</b> Based System are {{introduced}} for library book information on mobile application. A hybrid approach is employed as solution to replace the Digital Resource, Web based Software System and Catalogue. Quick Response (QR) Code is an improvement to replace the barcode and it can access any sensor on mobile application. The methodology {{of this paper is}} to develop Library Book Information to be more effective and by combining Boyer Moore String Matching <b>and</b> <b>Rule</b> Based System. From the phase of Boyer Moore <b>and</b> <b>Rule</b> Based System, these are greatly simplified this system by using QR Code to get data in a real time. The result in Boyer Moore <b>and</b> <b>Rule</b> Based System shows with highest priority or threshold (maximum) to minimum. It can be concluded that the hybrid of Boyer Moore <b>and</b> <b>Rule</b> Based System can effectively support the library information system...|$|R

5|$|In the Computer Edge case, the Australian court {{decided against}} the then-prevailing {{opinions}} in other courts (the U.K., Canada, South Africa, and the U.S.) <b>and</b> <b>ruled</b> object code was not copyrightable, while the Supreme Court of Canada in Apple v.

The Canadian court opined that programs within ROM silicon chips are protected under the Copyright Act of Canada and the conversion from the source code into object code {{is a form of}} translation. It further held that such translation does not include the expression of an idea in another form, but rather only applies to the expression of an idea in another language, and that a translation has a one-to-one correspondence between works that are expressed in two different languages.|$|E
