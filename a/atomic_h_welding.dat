Our experiments thus far concentrate on increasing the stability and deposition rate of the polymer layers. To reach the thermal stability needed for the deposition of SiNx on PGMA by HWCVD, the PGMA chain length must be large.

For <b>atomic</b> <b>H,</b> the population transfer from n) 35 to 30 with nearly 100 % efficiency is achieved by means of the sequential two-photon ¢n) - 1 transitions. The calculation fully utilizes all of the available orbital angular momentum l states for a given n, and the interference pattern and population evolution dynamics of individual l states are analyzed in detail. It is shown that the coherent control of the population transfer from the high n to the low n states can be accomplished by the optimization of the chirping parameters and microwave field strength. Similar analysis is performed for the Na atom, where the alkali atomic structure is described by an accurate model potential. We found that while the global population transfer pattern is qualitatively similar, there are significant differences in the dynamical response of <b>atomic</b> <b>H</b> and Na to the chirped microwave fields. Due to the degeneracy of the l states (for a given n) in unperturbed <b>atomic</b> <b>H,</b> the population transfer involves significant coupling and interference among a number of low-lying l states.

Exposure to atomic O yields complete carbon erosion and CO 2 and H 2 O desorption. A dramatic increase in metallic and non-metallic oxide is observed for especially Ni and Co surfaces, while for Au and Cu, the sub-surface Mo layer is much more oxidized. Although volatile oxides exist for some of the d-metals, there is no indication of d-metal erosion.

Considerable changes in surface reactivity patterns have been measured, with surface conversion reactions being favoured over the competition between thermal decomposition and molecular thermal desorption that is apparent for these species {{in the absence of}} atomic hydrogen. Abstraction by atomic hydrogen from adsorbed ethylene is found to give rise to adsorbed acetylene, which then undergoes C-C scission to form adsorbed CH 2 groups when further exposed to <b>atomic</b> <b>H.</b> These species associate to desorb as ethylene at a higher temperature than is measured for the molecular form.

Varying the DMMP coverage by changing the pressure causes changes in the spectrum that can be related to the strength of the DMMP/SWNT interaction. Preadsorbed H is seen to have little or no effect on the subsequent adsorption of DMMP.
