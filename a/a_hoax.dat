5|$|Knight {{presented}} an elaborate conspiracy theory involving the British royal family, freemasonry and the painter Walter Sickert. He {{concluded that the}} victims were murdered to cover up a secret marriage between the second-in-line to the throne, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, and Annie Elizabeth Crook, a working class girl. There are many facts that contradict Knight's theory, and his main source, Joseph Gorman (also known as Joseph Sickert), later retracted the story and admitted to the press that it was <b>a</b> <b>hoax.</b> Most scholars dismiss the theory and the book's conclusion is now widely discredited.|$|E
