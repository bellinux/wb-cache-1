2500|$|In 1966, Einstein joined The High Windows with Shmulik Kraus and Josie Katz. Their {{first album}} {{went on sale}} in April 1967, six weeks before the Six-Day War, {{signaling}} a new direction in Israeli rock and pop. The album achieved considerable commercial success and its popularity was felt even in parts of Western Europe, primarily France. After a few concerts in Europe Einstein left the group after one year {{in the wake of}} a professional disagreement with Kraus. At the heart of things, Einstein felt uncomfortable creating music for a European audience who cannot truly appreciate the richness of the lyrics after it went through translation to French. He believed that the Hebrew language was intrinsic to his music. When interviewed many years later and <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> period in Europe Einstein stated [...] "Performing in a different language? It's bullshit. We are Hebrew artists, why should we pretend otherwise?" [...] Nevertheless, Einstein and Kraus remained close friends and would collaborate again in the future.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the notoriety}} {{surrounding}} how {{the band was}} signed with Durst, the band is often asked regarding their relationship with him. Scantlin criticized Durst {{in an interview in}} 2004 with Canada's Chart magazine. He stated, [...] "He doesn't write our songs, he doesn't produce our songs, he doesn't do anything for us. He doesn't do our videos anymore. He doesn't do anything for this band. I don't know what he's doing, I don't know what the guy's like. All I know is that he's like Mr. Hollywood guy, Mr. Celebrity. Like, 'I don't hang out with anybody except Hollywood celebrities'. Every single fucking interview I've ever fucking done, I get <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> fucking guy..." [...] He added, [...] "And for me to do interviews all the time and be asked about this certain individual... People think he writes music with me or something. He does not do that. I just don't get it. We have nothing in common. He doesn't even call us, he has his assistant call us to congratulate us on our record. Yeah, that's how pathetic he is." ...|$|E

[...] and he {{strutted}} by his partner's side, confident, happy, and eager for pleasure. Not long ago he did {{like to walk}} with her. Only yesterday, he liked to be with Theo and Hester, and good Mrs. Lambert; but pleasure, life, gaiety, the desire to shine and to conquer, had also their temptations for the lad, who seized the cup like other lads, and did not care to calculate on the headache in store for the morning. Whilst he and his cousin were talking, the fiddles from the open orchestra on the Parade made a great tuning and squeaking, preparatory to their usual evening concert. Maria knew her aunt was awake again, and that she must {{go back to her}} slavery. Harry never <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> slavery, though he must have known it, had he taken the trouble to think. He never pitied his cousin. He was not thinking about her at all. Yet when his mishap befell him, she had been wounded far more cruelly than he was. He had scarce ever been out of her thoughts, which of course she had had to bury under smiling hypocrisies, as is the way with her sex. I know, my dear Mrs. Grundy, you think she was an old fool? Ah! do you suppose fools' caps do not cover grey hair, as well as jet or auburn? Bear gently with our elderly fredaines, O you Minerva of a woman! Or perhaps you are so good and wise that you don't read novels at all. This I know, that there are late crops of wild oats, as well as early harvests of them; and (from observation of self and neighbour) I have an idea that the avena fatua grows up to the very last days of the year.|$|E

60|$|It is {{sometimes}} valuable {{to have enough}} imagination to unlearn {{as well as to}} learn. I would ask the reader to forget his reading and everything that he learnt at school, and consider the English monarchy as it would then appear to him. Let him suppose that his acquaintance with the ancient kings has only come to him as it came to most men in simpler times, from nursery tales, from the names of places, from the dedications of churches and charities, from the tales in the tavern, and the tombs in the churchyard. Let us suppose such a person going upon some open and ordinary English way, such as the Thames valley to Windsor, or visiting some old seats of culture, such as Oxford or Cambridge. One of the first things, for instance, he would find would be Eton, a place transformed, indeed, by modern aristocracy, but still enjoying its mediæval wealth and remembering its mediæval origin. If he <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> origin, it is probable that even a public schoolboy would know enough history to tell him that it was founded by Henry VI. If he went to Cambridge and looked with his own eyes for the college chapel which artistically towers above all others like a cathedral, he would probably ask about it, and be told it was King's College. If he asked which king, he would again be told Henry VI. If he then went into the library and looked up Henry VI. in an encyclopædia, he would find that the legendary giant, who had left these gigantic works behind him, was in history an almost invisible pigmy. Amid the varying and contending numbers of a great national quarrel, he is the only cipher. The contending factions carry him about like a bale of goods. His desires {{do not seem to be}} even ascertained, far less satisfied. And yet his real desires are satisfied in stone and marble, in oak and gold, and remain through all the maddest revolutions of modern England, while all the ambitions of those who dictated to him have gone away like dust upon the wind.|$|E

5000|$|Matt Frewer {{was chosen}} {{for his ability to}} improvise, and — {{according}} to producer Peter Wagg — his [...] "ideally exportable" [...] mid-Atlantic accent. The actor decided to model Max's personality after what he saw as the smarmy, self-important goofiness of The Mary Tyler Moore Show Ted Baxter. In a 1986 interview, Frewer said: [...] "I particularly wanted to get that phony bonhomie of Baxter ... Max always assumes a decade long friendship on the first meeting.

50|$|In November 2009, the EP Our Twilight was issued, and {{included}} four songs. Strangely enough, {{the same year}} came out an album by another Finnish band Swallow the Sun, called New Moon. Some people noticed a connection to Stephenie Meyer's Twilight saga of vampires, her novels being Twilight and New Moon. When Laine was <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> {{he said he had}} never heard of these vampire movies or books. Shortly after the EP had been issued, Barren Earth performed its first gig, in the club Dante's Highlight in Helsinki. However, the LP coming up on March 2010, most of the festivals had already been booked bands for the summer 2010. Barren Earth had a gig on Tuska Open Air Metal Festival, though.|$|E
