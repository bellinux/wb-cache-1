5|$|After passing exit 42, {{the turnpike}} curves away from US-81, turning {{northeast}} toward El Dorado and Emporia. It crosses the Arkansas River between Exits 42 and 45. Exit 45 (Wichita, K-15)) is <b>a</b> <b>trumpet</b> connection to K-15 in southern Wichita. It opened in 1956 {{as one of}} the original interchanges. As the highway continues northeast through Wichita, it comes to Exit 50 (East Wichita), a double-trumpet connection to the parallel Kellogg Avenue, which carries US-54 and US-400. It is one of the original 1956 interchanges. Exit 53, the final Wichita exit, is <b>a</b> <b>trumpet</b> connection to the K-96 freeway. The connector road junctions K-96 at a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange and ends at 127th Street East. The interchange opened c. 1994 along with the nearby piece of K-96.|$|E
5|$|One of the boys, Hugh Masekela at St Peter's School, told Father Huddleston of his {{discovery}} of the music of Louis Armstrong. Huddleston found <b>a</b> <b>trumpet</b> for him and as the interest in making music caught on among the other boys, the Huddleston Jazz Band was formed. Hugh Masekela did not stay very long in Sophiatown. He was in the orchestra of King Kong and then made his own international reputation.|$|E

5|$|A mile (1.6km) {{north of}} NY417, NY16 reaches a bridge over Olean Creek, a {{tributary}} of the Allegheny. On the other side, it becomes a four-lane road with a divider as it approaches NY17, currently concurrent with I-86 pending the entire expressway's upgrade to Interstate Highway standards. <b>A</b> <b>trumpet</b> interchange provides access to I-86 and NY17 in both directions in the vicinity of Baldwin Heights. But NY16 runs parallel to the freeway and remains a four-lane route, although no longer divided, following the Olean valley. At Hinsdale it finally does cross I-86/NY17. Shortly afterwards, in the hamlet of Maplehurst, NY446, the former route of NY408, comes in from the east and terminates.|$|E

5|$|A musical {{instrument}} is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound {{can be considered}} a {{musical instrument}}—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as <b>a</b> <b>trumpet</b> to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} primary education, Morales {{attended the}} Agrarian Humanistic Technical Institute of Orinoca (ITAHO), completing {{all but the}} final year. His parents then sent him to study for a degree in Oruro; although he did poorly academically, he finished all of his courses and exams by 1977, earning money on the side as a brick-maker, day labourer, baker and <b>a</b> <b>trumpet</b> player for the Royal Imperial Band. The latter position allowed him to travel across Bolivia. At {{the end of his}} higher education he failed to collect his degree certificate. Although interested in studying journalism, he did not pursue it as a profession.|$|E

5000|$|The lituus was <b>a</b> long J-shaped <b>trumpet.</b> Essentially, it was <b>a</b> {{straight}} <b>trumpet,</b> {{like the}} tuba, to which <b>an</b> animal-horn <b>trumpet</b> {{was attached to}} act as a bell; it is not unlike the Celtic carnyx. The lituus was a cult instrument used in Roman rituals and {{does not appear to have}} had any military uses, though the term was later used in the Middle Ages to denote <b>a</b> military <b>trumpet.</b> Surviving litui are between [...] long. Being the shortest of the Roman trumpets, the lituus was a higher pitched instrument, the sound of which Classical writers described as acutus ("high").

5|$|At {{the eastern}} edge of the island, the highway reaches Swift Creek, another channel {{separating}} Meadow Island from Jones Island. The parkway crosses the waterway and immediately enters <b>a</b> <b>trumpet</b> interchange with the Meadowbrook State Parkway. The right-of-way of the Loop Parkway connects to and from the northbound direction of the Meadowbrook Parkway while two other ramps provide access to the southbound Meadowbrook Parkway. The Loop Parkway handled an average of 30,520 vehicles per day in 2011 according to estimates made by NYSDOT. Traffic along the highway has steadily increased since 2003, when the department recorded a daily average of 24,740 vehicles.|$|E

He closed his 1723 Christmas cantata Sehet, welch eine Liebe hat uns der Vater erzeiget, BWV 64, with the fifth stanza, and his 1724 cantata Jesus schläft, was soll ich hoffen? BWV 81, {{with the second}} stanza. The closing chorale of cantata Bisher habt ihr nichts gebeten in meinem Namen, BWV 87, (1725) is a stanza from a hymn by Heinrich Müller on the same tune.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the Upper Ottawa Street crossing, {{residential}} {{developments are}} confined to {{the north side of}} the Linc as it curves southward, descending towards the top of the Red Hill Valley.

Albion Conservation Area to the southeast and the Red Hill Creek passing beneath the interchange to traverse the Niagara Escarpment at Albion Falls. The Linc gradually curves back northeast, now surrounded, passing under Pritchard Road. Immediately east of there, the Mud Street interchange branches off as the route curves northward and becomes the Red Hill Valley Parkway, which descends the escarpment towards the QEW.|$|E

Just inside of Gardiner, the highway passes through Minnewaska State Park, a large state park in the Hudson Valley. US44 and NY55 join US9W for roughly a half-mile southward along the western bank of the Hudson River before {{separating}} at <b>a</b> <b>trumpet</b> interchange south of Highland.

5|$|In 2000, {{construction}} {{began on}} the Quonset Freeway, a relocated Route403 that serves the Quonset Business Park from Route4. The project included the reconstruction and reworking of exit7 off Route4, which was a southbound-only exit serving both Route403 and Route402 when constructed. The exit was converted into <b>a</b> <b>trumpet</b> interchange with new ramps between Route4, Route403 and Route402 and was completed in December 2008, one year ahead of schedule. The project included {{the construction of a}} new northbound exit7 serving Route403 east.|$|E
5|$|MD 10 {{continues}} {{north from}} MD 177 through {{the east side}} of Glen Burnie as a six-lane freeway. The highway crosses over Marley Creek and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 648 (BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard). MD 10 parallels MD 270 (Furnace Branch Road) north then meets the latter highway at a partial cloverleaf interchange. The highway crosses Furnace Branch and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 710 (Ordnance Road), where northbound MD 10 becomes two lanes wide. MD 10 reaches its northern terminus at <b>a</b> <b>trumpet</b> interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway).

The turnpike {{continues}} northeast through the northern reaches of the Flint Hills, coming to an interchange with US-56 near Admire. This interchange, Exit 147, is the only interchange along the I-335 section of the turnpike other than the two end junctions.

5|$|Route 25 {{begins at}} <b>a</b> <b>trumpet</b> {{interchange}} with I-495 and I-195 in Wareham, Massachusetts; the two left lanes of Route 25 west mainline onto Route 495 north, with the right-hand lane serving I-195 via Exit 1. From I-195, Route 25 east is accessible via Exit 22A; I-195 terminates at the interchange. Interstate 495 also terminates at its junction with Route 25; the two southbound lanes of I-495 default onto Route 25 east. After the interchange with I-195 and I-495, Route 25 begins to {{head in a}} southeastern direction into the town of Wareham as a six-lane freeway. The route passes under Tihonet Road and through Maple Swamp, located at {{the northern end of}} Parker Mills Pond.|$|E
5|$|Several musical {{instruments}} have been found, including <b>a</b> <b>trumpet,</b> three violins and a viola da gamba, all expensive objects that probably belonged {{to either the}} officers or the trumpeters. One of the trumpeters on board {{was a member of}} the admiral's musical ensemble and it is assumed that one of the particularly fine, German-made instruments belonged to him. Another remnant of the officers' personal stores was discovered in 1997, consisting of a woven basket filled with tobacco and expensive imported foodstuffs and spices, including ginger, plums, grapes and cinnamon quills.|$|E
