5000|$|The {{most common}} SNP epoxygenase {{variants}} are as follows. 1) CYP2C8*3 (30411A>G, rs10509681, Lys399Arg) converts arachidonic acid to 11,12-EET and 14,15-EET with a turnover rate {{less than half}} that of wild type CYP2C8; in a single recent report, male but not female carriers of the CYP2C8*3 allele had an increased risk of essential hypertension. Bearers of this SNP may or may not show increased risk of developing acute gastrointestinal bleeding during the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are its substrates such as <b>aceclofenac,</b> celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, lornoxicam, meloxicam, naproxen, piroxicam, tenoxicam, and valdecoxib. 2) CYP2J2*7 (−76G>T, rs890293, upstream Promoter (genetics) site) has decreased binding of the Sp1 transcription factor resulting in its lowered expressionas and lowered levels of EETs in plasma. Carriers of this SNP among a Uygur population in China had a higher risk of coronary artery disease. However, CYP2J2*7 carriers showed no association with hypertension, heart attack, or stroke in a study of 5,740 participants of the cardiovascular cohort of the Malmö Diet and Cancer study; since other studies have afforded contradictory results, this allele is currently regarded as not associated with cardiovascular diseases (see Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid#Clinical significance). [...] Bearers of this SNP in a Chinese Population had a higher risk of younger onset of type 2 diabetes and among a Chinese Han population had a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease. 3) CYP2C8*2 (11054A>T, rs11572103, Ile269Phe) and CYP2C8*4 (11041C>, rs1058930, variants have reduced arachidonic acid-metabolizing activity but have not been clearly associated with cardiovascular or other diseases. 4) CYPC28*4 (3608C>T, rs1058930, Ile264Met) has reduced arachidonic acid metabolizing activity. It has not been associated with cardiovascular diseases but has a higher incidence in subjects with type II diabetes in a small sample of Caucasians in Germany. [...] 5) The CYP2C9*2 (3608C>T, rs1799853, Arg144Cys) variant has a 50% reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolizing activity compared to CYP2C9 wild type carriers of it show no association with cardiovascular disease but exhibit poor metabolism of the anti-coagulating, blood-thining agent, warfarin. These carriers are susceptible to the gastrointestinal bleeding side effects of warfarin and the NSAID cited above. 6 [...] ) CYP2C9*3 (42624A>C, rs1057910, Iso359Leu) encodes an expoxygenase with reduced arachidonic acid metabolizing activity. This allele has not been directly associated with cardiovascular diseases but may be associated with the poor metabolism and therefore adverse reactions to warfarin, NSAID, sulfonylurea-containing oral hypoglycemic agents, and the anti-(epilepsy) drug, phenytoin. 7) CYP2C19*2 (19154G>A, rs4244285, Il264Met) and CYP2C19*3 (17948G>A, rs4986893, His212X) are loss-of-function null alleles; carriers of the CYP2C19*3 but not the CYP2C19*2 allele showed a reduced risk of developing essential hypertension in a large Korean population study. Bearers of null alleles would be expected to be poor metabolizers of several drugs which are CYP2C19*2 or CYP2C19*3 substrates. This is particularly the case with Clopidogrel, a drug used to block platelet activation, blood clotting, and thereby heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery occlusion in people at high risk of these events; CYP2C19 metabolizes clopidogrel to it active form. Consequently, patients with severe deficiencies in this CYP, i.e. bearers of CYP2C19*3 or CYP2C19*2 alleles, fail to gain protection from clopidogrel and have a higher risk of the cited cardiovascular events than clopidogrel-treated patients bearing wild type CYP2C19 alleles. 8) CYPC19*17 (-800C>T, rs12248560, site upstream gene promoter site) causes overproduction of its epoxygenase and thereby the ultra fast metabolism of arachidonic acid. Bearers of this allele have not been associated with cardiovascular diseases but clearly show a decreased risk of developing breast cancer and endometriosis possible because their rapid metabolism of estrogen leads to lower estrogen levels and thereby a lower risk of these estrogen-fueled diseases. These bearers also a higher rate of metabolism of, and therefore reduced responsiveness to, certain proton pump inhibitor and antidepressant drugs.|$|E

40|$|The non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) diclofenac {{is highly}} toxic to Gyps vultures and its recent widespread use in South Asia caused catastrophic declines {{in at least three}} scavenging raptors. The manufacture of veterinary formulations of diclofenac has since been banned across the region with mixed success. However, at least 12 other NSAIDs are available for veterinary use in South Asia. <b>Aceclofenac</b> is one of these compounds and it is known to metabolise into diclofenac in some mammal species. The metabolic pathway of <b>aceclofenac</b> in cattle, the primary food of vultures in South Asia, is unknown. In this study, we give six cattle the recommended dose of <b>aceclofenac</b> (2 mg/kg), collect blood along a time series and undertake a pharmacokinetic analysis of <b>aceclofenac</b> and diclofenac-metabolites in their plasma using liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry.

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{investigate}} the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic interaction of <b>Aceclofenac</b> and Rosiglitazone alone and their combination in rats. The animals were maintained on standard laboratory conditions and were divided into 3 and 6 groups for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies respectively. <b>Aceclofenac</b> and Rosiglitazone alone produced antiarthritic and marked reduction in blood glucose levels (Antidiabetic) respectively but their combination produced a decreased efficiency of rosiglitazone for antidiabetic activity and increased antiarthritic activity of <b>aceclofenac</b> when co-administered with Rosiglitazone...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project was to develop formulation of <b>aceclofenac</b> microemulsion based gel and its in vitro in vivo studies. Excipients were screened by solubility studies (almond oil with highest solubility was selected) and phase diagram study for optimized formulations. For in vitro studies spectrophotometric and HPLC analytical methods were developed and validated under ICH guidelines. The different formulations were undergone stability studies and stable formulations were subjected to study in vitro release of <b>aceclofenac</b> from different formulations by Franz diffusion cell. The formulation with highest permeation rate (i. e. almond oil containing <b>aceclofenac,</b> Tween 80, isopropyl alcohol and water) was selected for further in vitro characterization including rheological studies, Zeta size, Zeta potential, XRD, SEM, FTIR, TGA and DSC. The in vivo studies were performed on rats, rabbits and finally on human volunteers. The flux, Jss (Ã¬g/cm 2 /h) for <b>aceclofenac</b> microemulsion, <b>aceclofenac</b> microemulsion based gel and conventional marketed gel was 1. 71 Â± 0. 06, 1. 52 Â± 0. 07 and 0. 91 Â± 0. 03, respectively. The percentage inhibition of inflammation was 76. 39 %, 74. 31 % and 70. 14 %, respectively for <b>aceclofenac</b> microemulsion, <b>aceclofenac</b> microemulsion based gel and conventional marketed gel. The percentage inhibition of analgesic effect was 80. 16 %, 75. 05 % and 70. 96 %, respectively for <b>aceclofenac</b> microemulsion, <b>aceclofenac</b> microemulsion based gel and conventional marketed gel. The pharmacokinetic parameters i. e. Cmax (Ã¬g/mL), Tmax (h), T 1 / 2 (h) and AUC 0 -inf in rabbits for microemulsion based gel and for conventional marketed gel were (6. 56, 5. 49); (5. 88, 5. 91); (4. 53, 4. 03) and (65. 21, 52. 32), respectively. The pharmacokinetic parameters i. e. Cmax (Ã¬g/mL), Tmax (h), T 1 / 2 (h) and AUC 0 -inf in healthy human volunteers for microemulsion based gel and for conventional marketed gel were (8. 30, 6. 61); (5. 50, 5. 89); (4. 26, 4. 08) and (57. 62, 55. 18), respectively. Therefore, it is concluded that microemulsion based gel has greater bioavailability as compared to enhanced patientâ€™s compliance...|$|E
40|$|<b>Aceclofenac,</b> a {{phenylacetic acid}} derivative, {{is a new}} nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID). It is indicated in the symptomatic treatment of pain and inflammatory or degenerative arthropathies: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, abarticular inflammations, posttrauma or postoperative inflammations. The usual oral dosage of <b>aceclofenac</b> is 100 mg twice daily in adults.

40|$|<b>Aceclofenac</b> is non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug with marked anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. It {{is indicated}} for the relief of pain and inflammation in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. <b>Aceclofenac</b> is BCS class II drug with low solubility and high permeability. Micronization technique is used to increase the solubility and thus dissolution of <b>Aceclofenac.</b> The micronization was done using jet mill micronizer. The initial particle size of drug is 297. 33 micron (D 90) which was reduced to particle size 121. 87 micron (D 90) with single micronization, particle size 116. 08 micron (D 90) with double micronization and 89. 23 micron (D 90) with triple micronization of drug. It was observed that the solubility and thus dissolution of <b>Aceclofenac</b> was increased in principle media of 6. 8 phosphate buffer and discriminating media 4. 5 Acetate buffer with single, double and triple micronization. Thus, it can be justified that micronization {{is one of the}} good technique for enhancement of solubility of <b>Aceclofenac</b> by reduction of particle size of drug...|$|E
