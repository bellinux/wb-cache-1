In contrast to omnivores such as rats, which only require about 4% protein in their diet, about 20% of a cat's diet must be protein. Cats are unusually dependent on a constant supply of the amino acid <b>arginine,</b> and a diet lacking <b>arginine</b> causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal.

40|$|This {{study has}} used {{chemical}} modification techniques {{to investigate the}} role of the only two types of positively charged amino acids, lysines and <b>arginines,</b> in the membrane-bound protein, bacteriorhodopsin (bR). The results of these chemical modifications have significance both for the structure of bR and for the molecular mechanism of light-activated photocycling and proton pumping. The implications for the secondary structure of bR are: LYS 40 is totally exposed to the aqueous phase, while the other five reactive lysines are partially buried in the hydrophobic domain; LYS 30, LYS 129 and LYS 159 are buried by only one or two residues within the hydrophobic domain; all but two <b>arginines</b> are totally exposed to the aqueous phase; and at least three ionic bridges form between <b>arginines</b> and carboxyl groups. These results were used to construct a new model of the secondary structure of bR. The implication for the tertiary structure of bR is that Model A (126) is the preferred model of fitting the bR sequence into the helices seen by electron diffraction. The implication for the quaternary structure is that one structural role of retinal is to increase the intermolecular distances between bR molecules in a trimer. This focuses attention on the bR trimer as the primary structural unit. Regarding the molecular mechanism of photocycling and proton pumping, two specific <b>arginines</b> were responsible for the slowdown of the photocycle. This result was obtained by a quantitative analysis of the inhibition of M decay as a function of fraction of <b>arginines</b> modified by 2, 3 -butanedione. Possible roles of the two important <b>arginines,</b> including controlling the conformational changes of the protein by ionic linkages to carboxyl groups and participating directly in proton pathways, are discussed. Bifunctional imidoester modification of lysines revealed that a conformational change of the bR protein is needed for photocycling, since cross-linking lysines slowed the photocycle. 2, 3 -Butanedione modification of <b>arginines</b> supported this result, since this modification caused a marked slowdown of the photocycle and also protein conformational changes as evidenced by tryptophan fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy...|$|R

The two <b>arginines</b> in the top right corner that are located next to each other on the back bone are actually from the other protein of this dimer enzyme. This interaction {{is one of the many}} intermolecular forces that holds these two tertiary structures together.

5|$|The archetypal {{example of}} this {{situation}} is antithrombin, which circulates in plasma in a partially inserted relatively inactive state. The primary specificity determining residue (the P1 <b>arginine)</b> points toward {{the body of the}} serpin and is unavailable to the protease. Upon binding a high-affinity pentasaccharide sequence within long-chain heparin, antithrombin undergoes a conformational change, RCL expulsion, and exposure of the P1 <b>arginine.</b> The heparin pentasaccharide-bound form of antithrombin is, thus, a more effective inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa. Furthermore, both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites (called exosites) for heparin. Heparin, therefore, also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin, further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties. After the initial interaction, the final serpin complex is formed and the heparin moiety is released. This interaction is physiologically important. For example, after injury to the blood vessel wall, heparin is exposed, and antithrombin is activated to control the clotting response. Understanding of the molecular basis of this interaction enabled the development of Fondaparinux, a synthetic form of Heparin pentasaccharide used as an anti-clotting drug.|$|E

40|$|The {{nucleolus}} is {{the hallmark}} of nuclear compartmentalization and has been shown to exert multiple roles in cellular metabolism besides its main function as the place of rRNA synthesis and assembly of ribosomes. Nucleolar proteins dynamically localize and accumulate in this nuclear compartment relative to the surrounding nucleoplasm. In this study, we have assessed the molecular requirements that are necessary and sufficient for the localization and accumulation of peptides and proteins inside the nucleoli of living cells. The data showed that positively charged peptide entities composed of <b>arginines</b> alone and with an isoelectric point at and above 12. 6 are necessary and sufficient for mediating significant nucleolar accumulation. A threshold of 6 <b>arginines</b> is necessary for peptides to accumulate in nucleoli, but already 4 <b>arginines</b> are sufficient when fused within 15 amino acid residues of a nuclear localization signal of a protein. Using a pH sensitive dye, we found that the nucleolar compartment is particularly acidic when compared to the surrounding nucleoplasm and, hence, provides the ideal electrochemical environment to bind poly-arginine containing proteins. In fact, we found that oligo-arginine peptides and GFP fusions bind RNA in vitro. Consistent with RNA being the main binding partner for <b>arginines</b> in the nucleolus, we found that the same principle...|$|R

However, optimized calculations of the titration behavior of charged groups, based on the finite-difference Poisson-Boltzmann technique, suggest that all the <b>arginines</b> are charged at physiological pH. Protonation of the clustered <b>arginines</b> is stabilized by one buried glutamate residue (Glu 58), which is strongly interacting with Arc, 75 and Arg 38.

Mutually stacked at shorter distances but in diverse geometrical modes otherwise, the cations tend to be in gross deficit of hydrogen-bond partners, and contributing electrostatics across protein-protein interface that, on average, is repulsive for protein-protein interaction.

40|$|Evolutionary {{traces of}} {{thermophilic}} adaptation are manifest, on the whole-genome level, in compositional biases toward {{certain types of}} amino acids. However, it is sometimes difficult to discern their causes without {{a clear understanding of}} underlying physical mechanisms of thermal stabilization of proteins. For example, it is well-known that hyperthermophiles feature a greater proportion of charged residues, but, surprisingly, the excess of positively charged residues is almost entirely due to lysines but not <b>arginines</b> in the majority of hyperthermophilic genomes. All-atom simulations show that lysines have a much greater number of accessible rotamers than <b>arginines</b> of similar degree of burial in folded states of proteins. This finding suggests that lysines would preferentially entropically stabilize the native state. Indeed, we show in computational experiments that arginine-to-lysine amino acid substitutions result in noticeable stabilization of proteins. We then hypothesize that if evolution uses this physical mechanism as a complement to electrostatic stabilization in its strategies of thermophilic adaptation, then hyperthermostable organisms would have much greater content of lysines in their proteomes than comparably sized and similarly charged <b>arginines.</b> Consistent with that, high-throughput comparative analysis of complete proteomes shows extremely strong bias toward arginine-to-lysine replacement in hyperthermophilic organisms and overall much greater content of lysines than <b>arginines</b> in hyperthermophiles. This finding cannot be explained by genomic GC compositional biases or by the universal trend of amino acid gain and loss in protein evolution. We discovered here a novel entropic mechanism of protein thermostability due to residual dynamics of rotamer isomerization in native state and demonstrated its immediate proteomic implications. Our study provides an example of how analysis of a fundamental physical mechanism of thermostability helps to resolve a puzzle in comparative genomics as to why amino acid compositions of hyperthermophilic proteomes are significantly biased toward lysines but not similarly charged <b>arginines...</b>|$|R

Detailed {{knowledge of this}} molecular mechanism {{can be used in}} designing a new class of small-molecule compounds against hyperexcitability diseases. Here, we show that <b>arginines</b> {{on one side of the}} helical K-channel voltage sensor S 4 increased the sensitivity to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), whereas <b>arginines</b> on the opposing side decreased this sensitivity. Glutamates had opposite effects. In addition, a positively charged DHA-like molecule, arachidonyl amine, had opposite effects to the negatively charged DHA. This suggests that S 4 rotates to open the channel and that DHA electrostatically affects this rotation. A channel with <b>arginines</b> in positions 356, 359, and 362 was extremely sensitive to DHA: 70 mu M DHA at pH 9. 0 increased the current greater than 500 times at negative voltages compared with wild type (WT).

5|$|Water {{and carbon}} dioxide from the {{interstitial}} fluid diffuse into the epithelial cells. Within these cells, carbonic anhydrase converts the substances into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the interstitium. Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen. This creates osmotic pressure and draws water into the CSF, facilitated by aquaporins. Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium, to maintain electroneutrality. Potassium and bicarbonate are also transported out of the CSF. As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein.

5|$|Growth hormone {{deficiency}} {{is almost}} certain if all other pituitary tests are also abnormal, and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1) levels are decreased. If this is not the case, IGF-1 levels are poorly predictive of the presence of GH deficiency; stimulation testing with the insulin tolerance test is then required. This is performed by administering insulin to lower the blood sugar to a level below 2.2mmol/l. Once this occurs, growth hormone levels are measured. If they are low despite the stimulatory effect of the low blood sugars, growth hormone deficiency is confirmed. The test is not without risks, especially in those prone to seizures or are known to have heart disease, and causes the unpleasant symptoms of hypoglycemia. Alternative tests (such as the growth hormone releasing hormone stimulation test) are less useful, although a stimulation test with <b>arginine</b> may be used for diagnosis, especially in situations where an insulin tolerance test is thought to be too dangerous. If GH deficiency is suspected, and all other pituitary hormones are normal, two different stimulation tests are needed for confirmation.|$|E
5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} encoded {{directly}} by the genetic code {{can be divided into}} several groups based on their properties. Important factors are charge, hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, size, and functional groups. These properties are important for protein structure and protein–protein interactions. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Trp) buried {{in the middle of the}} protein, whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent. (Note that in biochemistry, a residue refers to a specific monomer within the polymeric chain of a polysaccharide, protein or nucleic acid.) The integral membrane proteins tend to have outer rings of exposed hydrophobic amino acids that anchor them into the lipid bilayer. In the case part-way between these two extremes, some peripheral membrane proteins have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. In similar fashion, proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like glutamate and aspartate, while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like lysine and <b>arginine.</b> There are different hydrophobicity scales of amino acid residues.|$|E

The sheep insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL 3), a structural homologue of relaxin, also contains the n, n+ 4 <b>arginines</b> in the B-chain but they are displaced towards the carboxyl terminus by four residues (-X-X-X-X-Arg-X-X-Val-Arg-). Human INSL 3 increases the activity of human relaxin in mouse bioassays. Here, we investigated whether sheep synthetic INSL 3 affects the relaxin activity in rat atria. INSL 3 lacked relaxin-like agonist activity but blocked the activity of relaxin and competed for relaxin binding sites at high concentrations. We also synthesized analogues of INSL 3, with amino acid substitutions in the arginine-binding region. Analogues A, D and E, which have the <b>arginines</b> in positions identical to relaxin, showed weak relaxin-like agonist activity.

GPCR conformational changes induced by ligand binding are transduced into electrical current by the ion channel. This functional coupling {{is closely related}} to the length of the linker region formed by the GPCR C-terminus (C-ter) and Kir 6. 2 N-terminus (N-ter). Manipulating the GPCR C-ter length allows to finely tune the channel regulation, both in amplitude and sign (opening or closing Kir 6. 2). In this work, we demonstrate that the primary sequence of the channel N-terminal domain is an additional parameter for the functional coupling with GPCRs. As for all Kir channels, a cluster of basic residues is present in the N-terminal domain of Kir 6. 2 and is composed of 5 <b>arginines</b> which are proximal to the GPCR C-ter in the fusion proteins. Using a functional mapping approach, we demonstrate the role of specific <b>arginines</b> (R 27 and R 32) for the function of ICCRs, indicating that the position and not the cluster of positively-charged <b>arginines</b> is critical for the channel regulation by the GPCR. Following observations provided by molecular dynamics simulation, we explore the hypothesis of interaction of these <b>arginines</b> with acidic residues, and using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified aspartate D 307 and glutamate E 308 residues as critical for the function of ICCRs.

5|$|When {{taken up}} into the human body from the diet, the 20 {{standard}} amino acids either are used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or are oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide {{as a source of}} energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase; the amino group is then fed into the urea cycle. The other product of transamidation is a keto acid that enters the citric acid cycle. Glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis. Of the 20 standard amino acids, nine (His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, Trp and Val) are called essential amino acids because the human body cannot synthesize them from other compounds at the level needed for normal growth, so they must be obtained from food. In addition, cysteine, taurine, tyrosine, and <b>arginine</b> are considered semiessential amino-acids in children (though taurine is not technically an amino acid), because the metabolic pathways that synthesize these amino acids are not fully developed. The amounts required also depend on the age and health of the individual, so it is hard to make general statements about the dietary requirement for some amino acids.

RA has been epidemiologically associated with periodontal disease, whose main infective agent is Porphyromonas gingivalis. Uniquely among microbes, P. gingivalis secretes a PAD, termed PPAD (Porphyromonas peptidylarginine deiminase), which is genetically unrelated to eukaryotic PADs. Here, we studied function of PPAD and its substrate-free, substrate-complex, and substrate-mimic-complex structures.

The four polypeptides of KcsA are postulated to surround the end unit of the polyP molecule with a collar of eight <b>arginines,</b> thereby modulating the negative charge of the polyP end unit and increasing its preference for binding monovalent cations. Here we show that KcsA channels can be activated in planar lipid bilayers at pH 7. 4 by the chemical potential alone. Moreover, {{one or both of}} the C-terminal <b>arginines</b> are replaced with residues of progressively lower basicity–lysine, histidine, valine, asparagine–and the effects of these mutations on conductance and selectivity for K+ over Mg 2 + is tested in planar bilayers as a function of Mg 2 + concentration and pH. As the basicity of the C-terminal residues decreases, Mg 2 + block increases, and Mg 2 + becomes permeant when medium pH is greater than the pI of the C-terminal residues. The results uphold the premise that polyP and the C-terminal <b>arginines</b> are decisive elements in KcsA channel regulation...|$|R

Deglycosylated, neutral forms of avidin are available through Sigma-Aldrich (Extravidin), Thermo Scientific (NeutrAvidin), Invitrogen (NeutrAvidin), and e-Proteins (NeutraLite).|$|R
