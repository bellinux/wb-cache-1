5|$|Like many earthstars, {{the fungus}} uses {{the force of}} falling raindrops to help {{disperse}} the spores, which are ejected in little bursts when objects (such as rain) strike the outer wall of the spore sac. The gleba is brown to grayish-brown, with a cotton-like texture that, when compressed, allows the endoperidium to flex quickly and create <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> air that is forced out through the ostioles. This generates a cloud of spores that can then be carried by the wind. There are columellae (sterile structures that start {{at the base of}} the gleba and extend through it), which are usually not evident in the mature gleba, but apparent {{at the base of the}} spore sac. The columellae are not connected to the ostioles, but rather, terminate within the gleba at some distance from them. The capillitia (sterile strands within the gleba) are long, slender, free, tapering, unbranched, and 2–5μm thick, with thickened walls. The spores are spherical, nonamyloid, and are ornamented with irregularly shaped flaring protuberances up to 2μm high. They measure 3.9–4.8μm in diameter (without ornamentation), and 5.4–7.0μm including the ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouthpiece}} {{and reed}} {{are surrounded by}} the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on the reed and form an airtight seal. Air is blown past the reed and down the instrument. In {{the same way a}} flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past the reed causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth increases, the amount the reed vibrates increases until the reed hits the mouthpiece. At this point the reed stays pressed against the mouthpiece until either the springiness of the reed forces it to open or a returning pressure wave 'bumps' into the reed and opens it. Each time the reed opens, <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> air goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again. When played loudly, the reed can spend up to 50% of the time shut. The 'puff of air' or compression wave (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air) travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes {{at the point where the}} tube opens out. This is either at the closest open hole or at the end of the tube (see diagram: image 1).|$|E
25|$|To {{complete}} the teapot metaphor, under good conditions, a particularly dense {{area of the}} Milky Way can be seen rising in a north-westerly arc above the spout, like <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> steam rising from a boiling kettle.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} AOM {{is related to}} {{childhood}} anatomy and immune function. Either bacteria or viruses may be involved. Risk factors include exposure to smoke, use of pacifiers, and attending daycare. It occurs more commonly among Indigenous peoples {{and those who have}} Down syndrome. OME frequently occurs following AOM and may be related to viral upper respiratory infections, irritants such as smoke, or allergies. Looking at the eardrum is important for making the correct diagnosis. Signs of AOM include bulging or a lack of movement of the tympanic membrane from <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> air. About 4.4% of the population develop CSOM.|$|E
25|$|According to a {{majority}} of the interviewed witnesses, the airplane suddenly rolled to the left until the wings were perpendicular to the ground. The aircraft then descended in a nose-down attitude and disappeared from sight behind trees near the airport. One witness told investigators that they saw <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> smoke emanate from the aircraft prior to or subsequent to the airplane rolling to the left. Others reported loud engine noises described as a squeal, whine, or an overspeeding or accelerating engine during the last moments of the flight, although they said that these noises seemed to have stopped, or at least faded before the aircraft impacted with flat ground two miles short of the runway.|$|E

25|$|With either two {{or three}} overs {{remaining}} on day five (depending on how fast the overs were bowled) the game looked certain for a draw (as India still had three wickets in hand and were 122 runs behind). But Clarke, in just his second over, took two wickets in consecutive balls {{to be on a}} hat-trick. The first ball of his second over reared after drawing <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> dust, caught the shoulder of Harbhajan's bat and flew to Hussey at slip, and R. P. Singh padded up to his first ball and was adjudged lbw. There was an extensive delay as the last batsman Sharma took to the field with two right-handed gloves and had to wait for the correct glove to be brought out to him. This led to suspicion that the Sharma's actions were not accidental but a time-wasting ploy. Clarke took the final wicket, Sharma, in the same over, giving Australia victory. Kumble finished the day unbeaten on 45.|$|E

At an unspecified time in her youth, she had suffered from migraines.|$|E
500|$|The endoperidium is [...] in {{diameter}} by [...] high, sessile, and a dull grayish brown. The peristome {{is made of}} radially arranged fibrils that clump together at the apex in groups of unequal length to form an opening that appears jagged or torn. The circular area bordering the peristome is a paler color. Spores {{are thought to be}} dispersed by the wind sucking them out when it blows over the hole, or when falling raindrops hit the flexible endoperidium, creating <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> air that forces the spores through the ostiole.|$|E

500|$|As in English, voiceless stops are {{aspirated}} (articulated with <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> air {{immediately upon}} release) {{at the start}} of a word, while voiced stops may be incompletely voiced but are never aspirated. Voiceless stops are unaspirated after [...] and [...] (e.g. [...] 'terror'); however, stops remain aspirated after the clitic is [...] (e.g. [...] 'it's crooked'). Several researchers (e.g. , , , , and [...] ) use transcriptions like , etc., indicating they consider the stops that occur after voiceless fricatives to be devoiced allophones of the voiced stops rather than unaspirated allophones of the voiceless stops (as is actually the case in Scottish Gaelic), but this is a minority view.|$|E
500|$|The horns, {{which are}} found on {{both males and}} females, have two to three twists and are {{typically}} [...] in females and [...] in males, although the maximum recorded length is [...] The lower and mid portions of the horns are marked {{with a series of}} 30 to 35 ring-shaped ridges. The tail is short and slender, ending in <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> black hair. The hooves are broad with flat soles and strong dewclaws to help them walk on soft sand. All four feet possess scent glands. The life span of the addax is up to 19 years in the wild, which can be extended to 25 years under captivity.|$|E
500|$|News {{coverage}} of the battle produced television footage of ZNG air defence artillery at Zečevo firing at a Yugoslav Air Force Soko J-21 Jastreb and scoring a hit on another J-21 using a guided missile. The footage, ending in shouts claiming that both of the planes were downed, {{became one of the}} most significant pieces of material in terms of propaganda and morale in Croatia. Nonetheless, the footage proved controversial, since the first plane is not shown falling to the ground or into the sea, but diving towards the horizon after giving away <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> smoke [...] variously interpreted as smoke caused by the plane's cannon fire or anti-aircraft fire damage. While the first J-21 downing remains unconfirmed, the second J-21, piloted by Croat Valter Juršić of the 240th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Squadron, was shot down by Neven Livajić using a 9K38 Igla and wreckage of the plane was retrieved.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{being caught}} {{unprepared}} by the attack, Sherman rallied his division and conducted an orderly, fighting retreat that helped avert a disastrous Union rout. Finding Grant {{at the end}} of the day sitting under an oak tree in the darkness and smoking a cigar, Sherman felt, in his words, [...] "some wise and sudden instinct not to mention retreat". In what would become one of the most notable conversations of the war, Sherman said simply: [...] "Well, Grant, we've had the devil's own day, haven't we?" [...] After <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> his cigar, Grant replied calmly: [...] "Yes. Lick 'em tomorrow, though." [...] Sherman proved instrumental to the successful Union counterattack of April 7, 1862. At Shiloh, Sherman was wounded twice—in the hand and shoulder—and had three horses shot out from under him. His performance was praised by Grant and Halleck and after the battle, and he was promoted to major general of volunteers, effective May 1, 1862.|$|E
500|$|In {{designing}} the credit sequence for the film, graphic designer Daniel Kleinman {{was inspired by}} the cover of the 1953 British first edition of Casino Royale, which featured Ian Fleming's original design of a playing card bordered by eight red hearts dripping with blood. Kleinman said, [...] "The hearts not only represent cards but the tribulations of Bond's love story. So I took that as inspiration to use playing card graphics in different ways in the titles," [...] like a club representing <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> gun smoke, and slashed arteries spurting thousands of tiny hearts. In creating the shadow images of the sequence, Kleinman digitised the footage of Craig and the film's stuntmen on the Inferno visual effects system, at Framestore CFC in London; the actors' silhouettes were incorporated into more than 20 digitally animated scenes depicting intricate and innovative card patterns. Kleinman decided not to use the female silhouettes commonly seen throughout the Bond title sequences, considering that the women did not fit with both the film's spirit and the storyline following Bond falling in love.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé first {{performed}} [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] with Jay Z [...] at the 2003 BET Awards. They {{also performed}} the song during the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards.

[...] "Crazy in Love" [...] was included on the set list for most of Beyoncé's concert tours. The song was the closing track of her Dangerously in Love World Tour that began in late 2003. Beyoncé performed [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] live at the 2004 BRIT Awards February 17, 2004. Monique Jessen And Todd Peterson wrote that she, [...] "...lit up the stage with her performance of [...] "Crazy in Love", wearing a white Roberto Cavalli dress and {{nearly half a million}} dollars worth of diamonds. The pop diva, appearing onstage in <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> smoke, stopped midway through the song to pull up her top before walking away with the best international female solo artist award."

60|$|As the day {{advanced}} {{it became}} very sultry. Towards the afternoon I stopped and gazed thoughtfully at the placid Danube, which, flowing round the gentle curve of Slobosia, reflected in its glittering waters the white domes and minarets of the opposite town of Rustchuk. A low, rumbling sound startled me just then from a reverie. On looking up I perceived <b>a</b> small <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> smoke roll out {{in the direction of}} the Turkish shore. Another and another succeeded, and after each shot <b>a</b> smaller <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> smoke was seen to hang over the Turkish batteries opposite.|$|R
500|$|The protagonist is also {{challenged}} {{in his or}} her quest by 20types of creatures. [...] By moving the joystick while pressing its button or by performing the equivalent keyboard commands, the player defends the protagonist with four styles of attacks: a low slash, a high chop, a kick, and a spinning neck chop. [...] The life of the combatants are represented by gauges at the top corners of the screen. [...] Successful attacks on a character reduce its gauge and the character is killed when its life is reduced to zero. [...] A well-timed neck chop (or the bites of certain monsters) decapitates the opponent, killing it instantly. [...] Monsters disappear in <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> smoke when killed, reappearing with a full life gauge in the same room some time later. [...] Although the player character likewise reappears fully rejuvenated in the room after being killed, he or she can only do so for a limited number of times. [...] This limit (number of lives) is represented in the form of globes at the top centre of the screen. [...] The protagonist increases his or her number of lives by collecting skulls that are scattered throughout the game world.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{is one of}} Naruto Uzumaki's {{signature}} techniques, {{invented by}} Tobirama Senju with the instructions placed in a forbidden scroll that Naruto was tricked into stealing by a ninja named Mizuki. Unlike regular clone jutsus, the Shadow Clones are physical clones of the user capable of cohabiting with their surroundings, performing jutsu, and engaging in battle before dispersing in <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> smoke when sufficiently damaged or at the user's discretion. When clones are created, the user's chakra is evenly distributed among them, making it easy for the user to quickly expend their chakra. While most ninja limit themselves to only making a few clones because of this, Naruto can create thousands of clones due to his large amount of chakra. He can also combine it with his [...] "Sexy Jutsu" [...] to produce the [...] "Harem Jutsu". During Part II, having been unaware of this fact until Kakashi explains it, Naruto learns that any knowledge his clone possesses will be transferred {{to him at the}} moment that the jutsu is canceled. This fact enables Naruto {{to make use of the}} Jutsu in training to gain years of experience in days, and to cover more ground by using his Shadow Clones as scouts.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed in mid-September 2009 in Vancouver. Due to the Russian {{lettering}} {{on many of}} the episode props, director Cassar joked during shooting, [...] "Can we get a translator and find out what this writing means, specifically? Maybe it says 'Do not open until Christmas' or 'Watch The Simpsons on Sunday night,' knowing Fox." [...] To create the episode's auditory effects, sound editor Bruce Tanis explained his production steps in an interview with Designing Sound, [...] "'Earthling' was a really good episode for strange sounds. It starts out with the appearance of a smoke monster that kills its victims by enveloping them and leaving behind an exact life-like looking corpse only the body is made of ash which crumbles horribly when touched. The smoke creature moved rapidly as opposed to gently drifting so I had some movement to play off of in creating a sound for him. I came up with some stuttering, fluttery whooshes that kind of vibrated which made him more dangerous than if he sounded like <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> steam moving along the hall. The smoke monster requires a host body to live in when he's not vibrating around killing people. The only way to recall the smoke monster to the host body, or to keep him there in the first place, is by severe electrical shock." ...|$|E
