40|$|In {{the case}} of Apouviepseakoda v. Gonzales, the {{majority}} and the dissent of the Seventh Circuit heavily criticized the immigration judge’s behavior during the removal hearing. Yet, the majority seemed {{to go out of}} its way to affirm denial of asylum. The majority held that, although the IJ’s behavior during the asylum hearing was inappropriate, it did not amount to reversible error. The majority would reverse only if the IJ’s behavior were so inappropriate that it frazzled the <b>asylum</b> <b>applicant</b> or barred large portions of the applicant’s testimony. What this decision does not account for is the fact that the IJ, who was openly hostile towards the <b>asylum</b> <b>applicant,</b> was making a subjective finding regarding the asylum applicant’s truthfulness and believability. In such a situation, the Seventh Circuit’s rule requiring actual prejudice in addition to IJ bias will frequently result in the denial of otherwise valid asylum claims. Where the IJ exhibits bias against the <b>asylum</b> <b>applicant,</b> the ability of the IJ to serve as a fact-finder is compromised.

40|$|Asylum law {{is based}} on an {{international}} treaty, but federal courts routinely invoke U. S. constitutional norms in adjudicating asylum claims. Specifically, they rely on constitutional norms when gauging whether an <b>asylum</b> <b>applicant</b> has suffered harm amounting to “persecution” and whether the harm was inflicted “on account of” a protected characteristic, such as political opinion or religion. In a close analysis of this unusual practice, this Article argues that federal courts have come to inconsistent, and often incompatible, conclusions regarding the use of constitutional norms in the analysis of asylum claims: principally, on whether constitutional norms establish sufficient, insufficient, necessary, or unnecessary conditions for qualifying for asylum. In addition to exposing these inconsistencies, this Article offers insights into improving the current practice of using constitutional norms in deciding asylum cases. Ultimately, this Article seeks to start a larger discussion of the diverse roles of constitutional law in asylum law and of the relationship between U.

The outcome depends very much on the interviewee's ability and willingness to share relevant information on his or her case.

In the interplay between elicited accounts and interactional processes, meanings and identities are negotiated and resisted in narrative discourse as part of the encounter between the interviewing officer, the interpreter, and the <b>asylum</b> <b>applicant,</b> within the social practice of asylum procedures.

40|$|When trauma {{survivors}} seek {{asylum in}} the United States, the deck is stacked against them. In most cases, the applicant’s {{story is the}} only direct evidence of the applicant’s claim, and asylum is certain to be denied if a judge finds the applicant not credible. But the stories told by trauma survivors defy cultural norms for a credible story: they are often inconsistent, vague, and both logically and chronologically disjointed. As a result, asylum may be wrongly denied. The problem is inherent in our asylum adjudication system, which subjects most applicants to an adversarial hearing. This article uses scholarship on trauma and narrative theory to examine the challenges faced by survivors who seek asylum – and the ways a lawyer might inadvertently increase the odds of an adverse decision while drafting a declaration. The article also details original empirical research on 369 appellate cases in which immigration judges found an <b>asylum</b> <b>applicant</b> to be not credible. Overwhelmingly, judges cited inconsistencies in the applicant’s story as grounds for that conclusion – yet research among survivors proves that such discrepancies cannot be taken as evidence of falsehood. As a result, the article recommends that the adjudication of asylum claims should be removed from U. S. immigration courts, and that existing procedures be replaced with a single non-adversarial adjudication for all asylum applicants...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the evolution of}} the nexus requirement in United States refugee law since the Elias-Zacarias decision. Part I discusses the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Elias-Zacarias, identifying the choices the Court made among the arguments presented before it that resulted in the motive-oriented approach to nexus. This Part also delves into the Court 2 ̆ 7 s statement about the evidence required to demonstrate motive, concluding that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of the evidence before it foreshadows the confusion lower courts have demonstrated in evaluating evidence of motive. Part II looks at appellate decisions on the nexus issue since 1992, highlighting cases that exemplify the disparity among appellate decisions. This Part concludes that the appellate courts 2 ̆ 7 differing evidentiary requirements have resulted in a lack of uniformity that is both unfair to asylum applicants and contrary to the United States 2 ̆ 7 treaty obligations. Part III addresses how asylum decisionmakers could work within the precedent of Elias-Zacarias to bring the United States closer to compliance with international law. Specifically, this Part argues that a thoughtful use of inferences from circumstantial evidence of the applicant 2 ̆ 7 s predicament could ensure that applicants receive fair and uniform treatment in the application of the nexus requirement. This Article concludes that, to comply with the mandates of both the Convention and Elias-Zacarias, courts must focus on the predicament from which the <b>asylum</b> <b>applicant</b> fled, and use circumstantial evidence to infer motive instead of placing an undue burden on the applicant to prove the persecutor 2 ̆ 7 s state of mind...|$|E
40|$|Pursuant to its {{obligations}} under international law, the U. S. government {{has agreed to}} provide protection to individuals who fear persecution {{in their home countries}} for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. This protection in the United States takes the form of asylum, and the asylum statute states that the United States will protect individuals from persecution that occurred or will occur “on account of” one of those grounds. The Supreme Court has stated that {{in order to meet the}} “on account of” or “nexus” requirement, an <b>asylum</b> <b>applicant</b> must provide some evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, of persecutor motive. Congress later declared that a protected ground must be “one central reason” for the persecution. There is, however, no statutory, regulatory, or judicial authority setting forth the proper analytical framework for determining nexus in asylum cases. In a previous article, I argued that in most cases, the “but-for” causation model from tort law would suffice as a method of establishing causation in asylum cases. I acknowledged, however, that this model may not provide the proper framework for all cases, particularly cases involving mixed or multiple motives for the persecution. This Article sets forth a burden-shifting framework for such cases that is inspired by the frameworks for assessing causation in U. S. antidiscrimination law and, to a lesser extent, tort law. The Article draws from the literature and jurisprudence surrounding intent in U. S. asylum law and antidiscrimination law, as well as from mixed motives jurisprudence. The framework proposed in this Article, used in conjunction with the but-for test proposed in the previous article, provides a rule for determining causation in asylum cases that would lead to more consistent, fair results and would bring the United States more in line with its international obligations...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the principles and factors underlying the culturally competent nursing care of asylum applicants. Asylum applicants are a highly vulnerable group, whose health is often severely compromised prior to arrival in the UK due to exposure to torture, violence and rape. Although they are entitled to primary health care services whilst their asylum claim is under consideration, their level of welfare support has been significantly eroded over the last decade. An analysis of the nursing literature revealed mainly US notions of cultural competence, which were based on a private health care insurance system rather than a universal health care system of equitable, accessible and non-discriminatory service provision, such as the NHS. A Five Steps Model of cultural competence (Quickfall 2004) was later revised to provide a theoretical framework for this research study. Data for this ethnographic study were collected during 2005 - 2007 with asylum applicants and community nurses within one Health Board in Scotland, using participant observation, individual, narrative and group interview methods. The data were analysed for their categorical content. The findings are presented as vignettes to highlight cultural competence issues. Three major themes emerge from the study findings, which highlight the intermediary function of community nursing. The provision of equitable, accessible and non-discriminatory services remains pertinent in the 21 st century. Secondly, the cross-cultural promotion of health involves a partnership process to ensure effective communication and the negotiation of person centred care. Thirdly, the delivery of socially inclusive services requires the aiding of <b>asylum</b> <b>applicant</b> adaptation to a new host environment. This study contributes to community nursing knowledge in explaining, through synthesis of the literature and study data, a model of cultural competence for the care of asylum applicants. It also provides a set of best practice statements, which require further investigation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|The {{international}} community finds itself {{today in the}} throes of the largest refugee crisis since World War II. As millions of refugees continue to flee violence and persecution at home, the immediate concern is humanitarian, but in the long-term, the important question becomes: What are our obligations to those who cannot return home? U. S. asylum law is designed not only to offer shelter to legitimate refugees, but also to protect the country from those who seek asylum under false pretenses. Lawmakers and policymakers have struggled to calibrate corroboration requirements for asylum claims with the reality that many legitimate asylum seekers {{may not be able to}} obtain such corroboration. Prior to Congress’s passage of the REAL ID Act (“REAL ID”) in 2005, no single standard governed the circumstances in which an immigration judge (IJ) could require an <b>asylum</b> <b>applicant</b> to provide extrinsic evidence to corroborate credible testimony. Though REAL ID established that asylum applicants usually must provide corroborating evidence whenever an IJ decides to require it, Congress created an exception for otherwise credible applicants who do not have such evidence and cannot reasonably obtain it. The circuits disagree, however, as to whether IJs must tell asylum applicants, before a decision is rendered, if they will be required to provide corroborating evidence and what sort of evidence they will need to provide. This Note argues that 8 U. S. C. § 1158 (b) (1) (B) (ii) reveals an unambiguous congressional intent to require an IJ to give asylum applicants advance notice of the evidence deemed necessary to corroborate otherwise credible testimony. It further contends that this advance notice must specify the type of corroboration expected, in order to give applicants who cannot reasonably obtain corroborating evidence a meaningful opportunity to avail themselves of the corroboration exception...|$|E
40|$|EU {{member states}} often use speedy (accelerated) asylum {{procedures}} to examine asylum claims that are deemed manifestly unfounded. Speedy asylum procedures should generally {{be considered to}} be {{in the interest of the}} <b>asylum</b> <b>applicant</b> and the state. Accelerated procedures have however been criticised for not being fair and resulting in inaccurate decisions. EU legislation allows the use of an accelerated asylum procedure in any asylum case and does not set minimum time limits for (certain stages) of asylum procedures. This does mean however that EU member states are completely free to design speedy asylum procedures. This article argues that the EU right to an effective remedy, laid down in article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter), and the principle of effectiveness limit member states' discretion to set time limits for asylum procedures. It is contended that EU law is violated if the speed of the proceedings undermines the effectiveness of the EU prohibition of refoulement and/or the right to asylum, guaranteed by articles 18 and 19 of the Charter. Furthermore, short time limits are contrary to EU law if they render the exercise of the EU right to an effective remedy, or other procedural rights guaranteed by the Asylum Procedures Directive, impossible or excessively difficult. This is based on an analysis of EU legislation, the case law of the Court of Justice, and sources of inspiration of EU fundamental rights, in particular, the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. It is shown that time limits in asylum procedures should be reasonable and proportionate in general as well as in the individual asylum case. This article explores which factors should be taken into account when assessing time limits in the light of the EU right to an effective remedy and the principle of effectiveness in a particular case. © The Author (2014).
