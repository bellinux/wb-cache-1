5|$|Zahir's clan {{belonged to}} the Qaisi {{political}} faction in the centuries-long struggle between the Qais and Yaman confederations.

For the most part, Zahir respected the socio-political system that prevailed in the region he ruled. The alliances between him and local notables were bolstered by a network of marriages between the influential families of the area, including Zahir's Zaydani clan. Zahir's own marriages were politically advantageous as they allowed him to consecrate his rule over certain areas or his relationships with certain Bedouin tribes, local clans or urban notables. Zahir had five wives during his lifetime. Among his wives was a woman from the Sardiyah, a Bedouin tribe active in Transjordan and Palestine.

5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206).
