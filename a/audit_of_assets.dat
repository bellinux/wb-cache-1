The adoption <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> impairment recognition in China has brought about a considerable impact on financial reporting of Chinese listing companies in recent years. This new accounting practice provided a special environment, which was subjected to less endogeneity problems than usual, to test the relationship between the scale <b>of</b> <b>auditing</b> business and audit quality. Prior research reported empirical evidence that both market value and firm characteristics are empirically related to write-downs, reflected in the four dimensions return relevance, price relevance, persistence and determinant. Using these four dimensions, we investigated whether audit business scale advantage (ABSA) affect <b>audit</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> write-downs. We contribute to the literature with the following findings. First, auditors’ business scale is positively related to return relevance of write-downs. Second, auditors with ABSA not only enhance the relevance between impairments and economic variables but also weaken the relation between impairments and managerial variables; however, the results appear in {{only a few of the}} firm-specific variables. Third, results are mixed when we test the ABSA effect on price-relevance and persistence dimensions. Fourth, the ABSA effect is stronger when the complexity <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> write-downs requires some inside information to comprehend the nature of action. Adding to the main finding, we also found the ABSA effect became weaker when we proxy ABSA with raw data of companies’ business scale instead of the top five auditors in business scale. Taken together, our results show that the ABSA effect does exist in <b>auditing</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> write-downs, although with weak evidence. Our results also indicated rational auditor choice based on quality of service in China's audit market. We identified some unique factors from stakeholders’ cooperative structuring actions in China audit market as potential explanations to the market rationality...|$|R

40|$|The {{revaluation}} <b>of</b> non-current <b>assets</b> {{has become}} an accepted accounting practice in many countries including the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. This practice has implications for the external auditor who must decide whether to accept a valuation as reasonable and how much evidence to collect to support the decision. This thesis represents the first study to examine audit decision making in this area. Because {{of the absence of}} prior research, a series of structured interviews was undertaken with audit partners to identify the main audit issues. The results of these interviews, together with the relevant literature, were used to identify some of the factors that may impact on audit judgments concerning revalued assets. Hypotheses were developed and two complementary experiments were designed to test them. These were {{based on the premise that}} client management may be motivated to revalue in order to improve the appearance of the balance sheet, thereby increasing the inherent risk of misstatement. A 2 x 2 between-subjects design was used for both experiments, and the dependent variables measured were estimates <b>of</b> the planned <b>audit</b> hours to be spent on the revalued assets and likelihood judgments that the valuations would be accepted as reasonable. Experiment One considered the situation where auditors are faced with two conflicting risks which are likely to exist simultaneously in the audit environment. These were the threat of litigation arising from the client's breach of a debt covenant and the risk of losing the client. The study examined auditors' responses to high and low levels of these risks on the <b>audit</b> <b>of</b> revalued owner-occupied property and an investment property. For the planned audit hours, results indicated a strong interaction effect between the two factors, with auditors planning to spend significantly more time on the <b>audit</b> <b>of</b> revalued <b>assets</b> when both the risk of breaching a debt covenant was high and the risk of losing the client was low. Similar results were found for the likelihood judgment that the valuations would be accepted as reasonable, except that for the investment property the results were only marginally significant. Experiment Two examined the impact of a proposal to issue shares to the public and the competence of the independent valuer on the <b>audit</b> <b>of</b> four classes <b>of</b> non-current <b>assets.</b> Results indicated that auditors would plan to spend longer on the <b>audit</b> <b>of</b> revalued <b>assets</b> when the client proposed to make a share issue and also when the competence of the valuer was lower. They were also less likely to accept the valuations as reasonable in these cases. However, an interaction effect between class <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> and competence <b>of</b> the valuer indicated that concern with some aspects of the evidence could override subjects' sensitivity to the competence of the valuer. An additional finding was a significant experience effect for the likelihood judgments, based on the number <b>of</b> <b>audits,</b> in which subjects had been involved, that had included asset revaluations. More experienced subjects were more likely than less experienced subjects to accept the valuations as reasonable...|$|R

40|$|In 2010, the Government Economic Service Review of the Economics of Sustainable Development {{recommended}} that a natural asset check {{should be investigated}} {{for use in the}} appraisal of public policy options. Considerations in environmental science and management can help to ensure that issues such as the ecological thresholds, cumulative impacts, the selection of appropriate accounting units and risk are handled appropriately in any natural asset check. Based on assessment of the contribution of the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (UK NEA) and other work, this paper makes a series of propositions in relation to the design <b>of</b> a natural <b>asset</b> check: 1. While the UK NEA draws together much of the information needed to design a natural asset check, a development of this framework will be required in order to perform the check. 2. Some kind of accounting model is likely to be more useful as a basis for a natural asset check than the frameworks used for ecosystem assessments. 3. A classification approach that links ecosystem services to the natural assets that underpin them is probably more efficient in capturing what is important in policy terms, than one that is based on a more abstract and generic classification <b>of</b> <b>assets.</b> 4. There are sufficient data resources available for a preliminary <b>audit</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>assets</b> to be made. 5. While a focus on non-marginal or irreversible changes in natural systems is important, it would be too restrictive to make this the exclusive concern <b>of</b> any natural <b>asset</b> check. 6.

Therefore, a ‘one-off’ natural asset check is unlikely to be reliable for policy analysis in the long term. Periodic audit will be necessary...|$|R

The telecommunication sector of Bangladesh commenced with small steps in 1989 when the license to a private operator was issued {{for the provision of}} inter alia cellular mobile services to strive with the previous monopoly provider of telecommunications services, the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB). In the late 1990 s, remark-able number of fixed and mobile services made their mark in Bangladesh. Thus, the number of services in operation has increased in the past fifteen years. Undoubtedly, the measures taken by the government and public sector have facilitated to grow this sector. Bangladesh, a highly populated market has attracted many foreign investors to invest in this sector. Fixed assets are very important for the business. Well we can say that without a fixed asset a company cannot physically exist. Fixed assets help a businessman to perform his activities and duties in the best way. Varieties <b>of</b> fixed <b>asset</b> make a businessman versatile in every ac-tivity of business. In 2015, Banglalink undertook a project on the fixed assets verification, which was mainly comprised <b>of</b> the physical <b>assets</b> verification <b>of</b> the company. Banglalink being a telecommu-nication company, its main fixed assets are the BTS (Base Transceiver Station) equipment that is situated on different regions across the country. This verification or <b>auditing</b> <b>of</b> fixed <b>assets</b> was previously done by a third party auditor.

Then I provide a theoretical rationale for a bank loan commitment as partial insurance against such future rationing. Incorporating uncertainty about both the creditworthiness of borrowers and the abilities of banks to screen borrowers, I show that the reputational concerns of banks can lead to an equilibrium in which loan commitments serve their role in increasing the supply of credit relative to the spot credit market, but produce the inefficiency of excessive credit supply when the stock market is doing well. Despite this, welfare is higher with loan commitments than with spot credit.; I use this result to then examine whether the level of the stock market [...] and more generally asset prices [...] should matter to bank regulators. My analysis suggests that it should, but not for the usual reason that a bull stock market could trigger inflation. Rather, it is because reputation-concerned banks lend too much during bull markets, leading to a worsening of credit quality and a higher liability for the federal deposit insurer. More stringent stock market information disclosure rules tend to attenuate this distortion and thus deserve consideration by bank regulators. A regulatory policy implication of the analysis is that regulation should be "state-contingent" [...] regulatory <b>auditing</b> <b>of</b> bank <b>asset</b> portfolios should be more stringent during bull stock markets, or asset pricing bubbles.

Incorporating uncertainty about both the creditworthiness of borrowers and the abilities of banks to screen borrowers, I show that the reputational concerns of banks can lead to an equilibrium in which loan commitments serve their role in increasing the supply of credit relative to the spot credit market, but produce the inefficiency of excessive credit supply when the stock market is doing well. Despite this, welfare is higher with loan commitments than with spot credit. I use this result to then examine whether the level of the stock market – and more generally asset prices – should matter to bank regulators. My analysis suggests that it should, but not for the usual reason that a bull stock market could trigger inflation. Rather, it is because reputation-concerned banks lend too much during bull markets, leading to a worsening of credit quality and a higher liability for the federal deposit insurer. More stringent stock market information disclosure rules tend to attenuate this distortion and thus deserve consideration by bank regulators. A regulatory policy implication of the analysis is that regulation should be “state-contingent ” – regulatory <b>auditing</b> <b>of</b> bank <b>asset</b> portfolios should be more stringent during bull stock markets, or asset pricing bubbles.
