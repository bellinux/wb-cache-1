It has multiple generation fuels uncertain fuel availability and storage options. The model is formulated in continuous time which mimics the many short trading periods common to electricity spot markets. It properly incorporates forward-looking generation decision making. It is calibrated to the New Zealand Electricity Market and is used to estimate the effects of changes that may arise in characteristics of fuels - water and gas - as a consequence of climate change and climate change policies. It does so under the polar cases of a competitive market structure and monopoly. The results illustrate the importance of allowing for volatility and including management of storage in electricity market models. They suggest that reductions in <b>average</b> <b>hydro</b> fuel availability will reduce welfare significantly that increases in the volatility of hydro fuel availability will also affect welfare but to a very small extent and that the value of reservoir expansion is sensitive to the distribution of hydro fuel availability.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} an electricity {{market model}} {{and use it}} to explore the effect of climate change on electricity output and prices. It is calibrated to the New Zealand Electricity Market, and includes multiple generation fuels, uncertain fuel availability, and storage options. The model is formulated in continuous time, which mimics the many short trading periods that are common to electricity spot markets, while properly incorporating forward-looking generation decision making. Specifically, it is used to estimate the effects of changes that may arise in characteristics of fuels -water and gas- as a consequence of climate change and climate change policies. The model does this under the polar cases of a competitive market structure and monopoly. There are three key findings from the results. First, the results illustrate the importance of allowing for volatility and including management of storage in electricity market models. Second, they suggest that reductions in <b>average</b> <b>hydro</b> fuel availability will reduce welfare significantly. Increases in the volatility of hydro fuel availability will also affect welfare, but to a very small extent. Third, the value of reservoir expansion is sensitive to the distribution of hydro fuel availability. Finally, the effects of a carbon tax are also reported. dynamic optimisation, electricity spot market performance, stochastic fuel availability, storage options, climate change...|$|E
40|$|We {{calculate}} detailed NLTE synthetic {{spectra of}} a Pulsating Reverse Detonation (PRD) model, a novel explosion mechanism for Type Ia supernovae. While the hydro models are calculated in 3 -D, the spectra use an angle <b>averaged</b> <b>hydro</b> model and thus {{some of the}} 3 -D details are lost, but the overall average should be a good representation of the average observed spectra. We study the model at 3 epochs: maximum light, seven days prior to maximum light, and 5 days after maximum light. At maximum the defining Si II feature is prominent, {{but there is also}} a prominent C II feature, not usually observed in normal SNe Ia near maximum. We compare to the early spectrum of SN 2006 D which did show a prominent C II feature, but the fit to the observations is not compelling. Finally we compare to the post-maximum UV+optical spectrum of SN 1992 A. With the broad spectral coverage it is clear that the iron-peak elements on the outside of the model push too much flux to the red and thus the particular PRD realizations studied would be intrinsically far redder than observed SNe Ia. We briefly discuss variations that could improve future PRD models. Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Ap...|$|R
