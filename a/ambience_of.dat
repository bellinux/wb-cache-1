5|$|Fundamental to the {{performance}} and overall <b>ambience</b> <b>of</b> traditional Peking opera is the venue. There are many restored venues in Beijing dating from the late 17th century onwards, the opera stage at Prince Gong Mansion, Zhengyici-xi-lou and Huguang Guild Hall, being among them. However, modern venues for the general operatic and theatre stage are also common, such as the National Centre for the Performing Arts, and the Chang'an Grand Theatre located on the East Chang'an Avenue {{is an example of}} modern Peking opera theatre.|$|E
5|$|Waugh {{began at}} Heatherley's in late September 1924, but became {{bored with the}} routine and quickly {{abandoned}} his course. He spent weeks partying in London and Oxford before the overriding need for money led him to apply through an agency for a teaching job. Almost at once, he secured a post at Arnold House, a boys' preparatory school in North Wales, beginning in January 1925. He took with him the notes for his novel, The Temple at Thatch, intending {{to work on it}} in his spare time. Despite the gloomy <b>ambience</b> <b>of</b> the school, Waugh did his best to fulfil the requirements of his position, but a brief return to London and Oxford during the Easter holiday only exacerbated his sense of isolation.|$|E
5|$|Debates are {{punctuated with}} {{vigorous}} gestures which enliven the <b>ambience</b> <b>of</b> the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, robed {{in a formal}} monk’s attire. Some of the gestures (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic gestures are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender’s arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender, the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap the defender into a wrong line of argument. Each time a new question is asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a question is answered correctly, it is acknowledged by the teacher bringing {{the back of his}} right hand to his left palm. When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.|$|E

25|$|As the {{community}} grew in wealth and population and rose in socioeconomic status, Koreans expanded their presence eastward along Northern Boulevard, buying homes in more affluent and less crowded Queens neighborhoods {{and more recently}} into adjacent suburban Nassau County, bringing their businesses with them, and thereby expanding the Koreatown itself. This expansion {{has led to the}} creation of an American Meokjagolmok, or Korean Restaurant Street, around the Long Island Rail Road station in Murray Hill, Queens, exuding the <b>ambience</b> <b>of</b> Seoul itself. The eastward pressure to expand was also created by the inability to move westward, inhibited by the formidable presence of the enormous Flushing Chinatown (法拉盛華埠) centered on Main Street.|$|E

Capacitance-voltage and gate-leakage properties are characterized and compared. The {{results indicate that the}} NO-annealed sample exhibits the lowest interface-state and dielectric-charge densities and best device reliability. This is attributed to the fact that nitridation can create strong Si≡≡N bonds to passivate dangling Si bonds and replace strained Si-O bonds, thus the sample forms a hardened dielectric/Si interface with high reliability. © 2006 Chin.

25|$|Old Ebbitt Grill reopened at 675 15th Street NW {{in early}} October 1983. Clyde's Restaurant Group spent $4.4 million {{constructing}} and outfitting the interior. The architectural firm of Andrews & Chatelain designed the interior. The interior decoration {{was designed to}} mimic the bar at 1427 F Street, and included the game trophies (some of which were originals, not recreations, and rumored to have been shot by President Theodore Roosevelt). Old Ebbitt's famous mahogany bar was not installed in the new location, however. A replica was crafted instead. The walls were paneled in mahogany and the ceilings decorated with murals and stencils. The restaurant had seating for 200 at tables and in booths. The booths had green leather seats and velvet-covered walls, and were separated from one another by etched glass dividers. The long bar still sported mounted game animal trophies overhead, the fixtures were of marble or brass, and the curtains of lace. An oyster bar {{was added to the}} rear of the restaurant on the main floor. The kitchen featured a special charcoal-burning grill, and the wine cellar featured a Cruvinet wine dispensing system. Gas lamps were used in the main bar and booth area. A year after the Grill opened, the Washington Post said it had the best dining <b>ambience</b> <b>of</b> any restaurant in the city.|$|E

What models of intelligibility of perception can be used to pinpoint and clarify the notion <b>of</b> <b>ambience</b> ? Alternatively, in what respects do architectural and urban ambiences prompt us to adopt new ways of addressing the problematic of ordinary perception ? The aim {{of this paper is to}} highlight the close relation between ambience and perception. We seek to demonstrate that one of the issues for the notion <b>of</b> <b>ambience</b> is a reappraisal of the situated, sensory and practical character of perception. Three basic arguments are developed : ambience can be characterized as the quality of the situation, as a motor solicitation and as a sensory background...|$|R
500|$|The above opening {{sentence}} {{of the novel}} has a symbolic function: Russian critic Vadim K.

Dostoyevsky {{was among the first}} to recognize the symbolic possibilities of city life and imagery drawn from the city. I. F. I. Evnin regards Crime and Punishment as the first great Russian novel [...] "in which the climactic moments of the action are played out in dirty taverns, on the street, in the sordid back rooms of the poor".|$|E

[...] The song was recorded [...] "part-by-part, committing to different sounds by changing relative levels, EQ, and compression throughout," [...] and the engineers would slightly move microphones used to record Barker's drum kit to tailor the natural <b>ambience</b> <b>of</b> the home it was recorded in. Upon playback of a rough {{mix of the}} song, the engineer automated the music to fade at the song's conclusion, but mistakenly forgot {{to do the same}} for the vocal tracks. Hoppus, who had been listening to the Beach Boys at the time, liked the a cappella interplay of their voices. All agreed to keep it in the final version of the song.|$|E

With their enthusiasm and spontaneity, and {{the sense that the}} audience in the intimate <b>ambience</b> <b>of</b> the club is participating in the music, these performances share the characteristics that had been celebrated more than two decades before in the better-known Black Hawk performances. Although this phase of his career has frequently been overlooked, Manne, by this time, had greatly refined his ability to back other musicians sympathetically, yet make his own musical thoughts clearly heard.|$|E
