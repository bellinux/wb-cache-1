5|$|Berryman {{was also}} {{involved}} in the plan's execution, once more becoming chief of staff at New Guinea Force under Blamey in August 1943. Berryman was frustrated at the failure of Vasey's 7th Division to destroy the Japanese retreating from Lae, and personally annoyed by the way that Vasey forwarded compliments to Major General Ennis Whitehead while leaving <b>any</b> <b>complaints</b> about air support to be taken up by Berryman. Berryman was next involved with the planning for the landing at Finschhafen, brokering a compromise landing plan between Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey and Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring. When Berryman discovered that the United States Seventh Fleet {{did not intend to}} reinforce the 9th Division he immediately went to Blamey, who took the matter up with MacArthur. However, it was Berryman who brokered a compromise deal with Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender to reinforce Finschhafen with a battalion in APDs.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the local}} {{political}} discussion has been about building a stadium, beginning in the 1990s when a Maryland location was chosen for what is now FedExField. With the possibility of building a new stadium in the near future, both the previous and current mayors of the District of Columbia have stated that a name change {{must be part of}} the discussion, however the team rejects that possibiltiy. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has met with the owner to discuss the building of a new stadium in Virginia. For many years, beginning with the departure of the Baltimore Colts, the Redskins were the only NFL team in a large area from Maryland into the southern states. This is slowly changing as Maryland NFL fans move to the Baltimore Ravens. Several Maryland politicians have stated that the name should change, but the current governor opposes any change, also citing the desire to keep the stadium in Maryland. Virginia fans are now the more numerous and dedicated supporters of the Redskins, and the state and local governments have used economic incentives to encourage the team's relocation of its facilities there, and maintain that the name is entirely a business decision for the team to make. An agency of the commonwealth, the Virginia Lottery, is a sponsor of the team, and says it has never had <b>any</b> <b>complaints.</b>|$|E

The Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT)'s 2014 report included a number of complaints of police using excessive force with detainees and also psychiatric patients. The culture of excusing police officers for their misconduct has continued well into the present day, and <b>any</b> <b>complaints</b> of mistreatment are often met with inadequate investigations and judicial proceedings.|$|E
25|$|On 21 September 2009, callers to the Liveline {{radio show}} on RTÉ Radio 1 {{complained about the}} phone charges and methods {{surrounding}} TV3's late night quiz show Play TV.

Some of the contestants had not been paid their prize money. TV3 advised viewers who played the game to go to RegTel with <b>any</b> <b>complaints.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another bold {{move in the}} show's final months saw Number 96 feature {{what was}} publicised as Australian television's first full frontal nude scene when new {{character}} Miss Hemingway (Deborah Gray) made {{the first of several}} unveilings in April 1977. Number 96 in 1976 had shown a bit-part nurse fleeing Dudley's bedroom which revealed a full frontal nude flash {{but this was the first}} time such nudity was shown front and centre in protracted scenes. In one outrageous moment, Miss Hemingway wore a bra but no panties and yet despite screening at 8.30pm on free-to-air TV, there were barely <b>any</b> <b>complaints</b> (but when the same scene was shown on the ABC during Four Corners, the bottom of the screen was blacked out). Other bedroom farce comedy sequences of the period featured increasing levels of male and female semi-nudity, and some other instances of full frontal female nudity. Meanwhile, a scene where Jane Chester becomes a prostitute and is asked to whip her male client, new Number 96 resident Toby Buxton (Malcolm Thompson) gave viewers a brief glimpse of full frontal male nudity.|$|E

25|$|The High Court {{may also}} {{exercise}} powers of revision {{in respect of}} criminal proceedings and matters in subordinate courts. On calling for and examining the records of criminal proceedings or otherwise, the Court may direct a magistrate to make further inquiries into <b>any</b> <b>complaints</b> of offences that have been dismissed, or into the case of any accused {{person who has been}} discharged. The Court may also exercise powers that it exercises upon an appeal, such as reversing a conviction or altering a sentence, except that the Court is not authorized to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction to convert a finding of acquittal into one of conviction. As in civil cases, when the Court is exercising its powers of revision it is up to it {{to decide whether or not}} to hear submissions from any party, and no party can claim a right to be heard. However, no order that prejudices an accused shall be made unless he or she has had an opportunity of being heard either personally or by advocate in his or her own defence. When a case has been revised by the High Court, it will certify its decision or order to the trial court, which may then make further orders that conform to the certified decision.|$|E

[...] Supervising producer David Livingston praised the prop and wardrobe departments for creating the array of [...] "cool-looking" [...] extras, while Michael Piller said that the whole episode was [...] "well produced".

500|$|Smythe {{was accused}} of acting solely for {{political}} gain. The publisher of the Globe and Mail {{at the time was}} prominent Conservative George McCullagh, and Smythe was friends with Ontario Conservative Premier George Drew. McCullagh and Drew may have used Smythe for their political ends to defeat King. The issue of lack of reinforcements was well-known within the Army and Smythe did not make <b>any</b> <b>complaints</b> to senior officers while in active service. Despite being criticized, Smythe kept up his public criticism in the newspapers. After James Ralston, Canada's defence minister, traveled to Italy, he saw for himself the shortage of skilled reinforcements. Ralston, who King did not trust, was replaced with Andrew McNaughton, who was against conscription. However, even King saw the need to send troops for the Canadian Army and he ordered 17,500 reserve troops to Europe in November 1944, which started to arrive in January 1945 ...|$|E
500|$|After {{winning the}} second race, Kenseth {{drove to the}} victory lane; earning $56,726 for the victory. Kenseth's victory gave his team Roush Fenway Racing its first win in the Gatorade Duels. Kenseth said, [...] "Jimmie Johnson gave me a huge push there and really worked nice for me the whole race. Without that push it never would've got there. Greg lost his {{drafting}} partner. We were able to separate him and the #78 [...] and we had such a big run that Greg {{was kind of a}} sitting duck." [...] Second-place finisher Smith stated while he would have preferred to win the race, he did not have <b>any</b> <b>complaints,</b> [...] "It’s good to know that we have a car capable of running up front." [...] Johnson, who finished third, said, [...] "It was an awesome race. We really had a shot to win that one. It was unfortunate there at the end that there were some lapped cars that were kind of mixed in with the leaders. It would have been nice if they would have let us race there; at least from the white flag on." [...] It took 46 minutes and 23 seconds to complete the second race, and the margin of victory was 0.209 seconds.|$|E
500|$|The British {{initially}} {{announced that}} around 6,000 civilians {{had been killed}} during the air-raid and a Soviet war correspondent attached to the 21st Army Group, Lieutenant-Colonel Kraminov, put the figure as high as 22,000, a claim that was used by French communists in post-war anti-British propaganda. It was later found that 300–400 civilians {{were killed in the}} raid. Caen citizens were relieved and provided their liberators with a welcome that the troops found very moving; French accounts of the time claim that [...] "All [...] Caen was in the streets to greet them". Although Ellis called the French welcome [...] "pathetic", no Allied unit recorded <b>any</b> <b>complaints</b> about the reception they were given. Stacey wrote that the populace were [...] "particularly delighted to find their city freed in part by men from Canada". Beevor wrote that most of the population were numb from the shock and quoted a British soldier who recalled that [...] "most ... women were crying, grief-stricken and anguished". As early as 12 June, the French Resistance had sent messengers to the British, informing them that refugees were gathering in the areas around the Abbaye-aux-Hommes and the Hôpital du Bon Sauveur and requested that these locations not to be bombed; British assurances were given and these locations were nearly untouched. Gray wrote that after the war, the city population regarded itself as being martyred, which could be seen on the war memorial.|$|E

500|$|Released in March 2006 and {{reported}} on game news sites as a curiosity in April {{of the same}} year, the Oblivion Topless Mod had been created by a woman calling herself [...] "Maeyanie."

[...] Pete Hines had discussed the mod with GameSpot staff before the game was re-rated, saying that he did not consider it a concern.
