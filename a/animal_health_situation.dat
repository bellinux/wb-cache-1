In 2003 OIE’s {{missions}} have changed a little, and its main objectives are to ensure transparency in the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>situation</b> throughout the world, to collect, analyse and disseminate scientific veterinary information, to strengthen international coordination and cooperation in the control of animal diseases, to promote the safety of world trade of animals and animal products, to improve the legal framework and resources of Veterinary Services and to develop international standards in animal welfare and animal production food safety. To achieve these goals, the OIE operates through different commissions, working groups and ad hoc groups and cooperates with several International organisations. The results of their activities give rise to publications...|$|E
40|$|Investment in {{disease control}} should be {{targeted}} to critical points {{that provide the}} greatest benefit to the livelihoods of livestock-dependent stakeholders. Risk-based targeting should balance the impacts of diseases against the feasibility of their control. This requires sensitive and specific surveillance systems that provide representative overviews of the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>situation</b> for accurate assessment of disease impact and transmission patterns. Assessment of impact should include household and market effects. The key in surveillance is involving livestock owners using active methods that ensure their disease priorities are addressed. Epidemiological targeting of interventions to critical points in disease transmission cycles {{should be done to}} obtain maximal disease reduction. Interventions should be delivered in full partnership with both private and community-based stakeholders to assure high uptake and sustainability. In developing countries, approaches such as participatory disease surveillance and community-based animal health programs have been effective and comply with international animal health standards. </span...|$|E
30|$|Epidemiological {{field studies}} in {{developing}} countries are often exciting for researchers because infectious diseases are relatively common in these countries, and the diseases typically have severe impacts. Therefore many opportunities exist for improving animal health and for setting-up preventive measures. Usually in such studies, the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>situation</b> is described, analysed and interventions are tested {{in the field and}} then the outcomes of the research are published in scientific journals. The researcher receives the glory and adds the scientific achievements to his/her academic or research resume. Unfortunately most of the farmers who provided the information or participated in the field trials are never informed about the outcomes of the study, nor trained to incorporate the study results into their daily farming practice. Although the farmers might be mentioned in the acknowledgements section of the scientific paper, they gain little benefit from their participation in the study. Hence, the benefits of the research are often accrued by the researchers rather than the farmers who participated.|$|E
40|$|The {{transfer}} of knowledge and information gained from scientific investigations into farm practice is a primary constituent of applied agricultural science. The importance of this for both agricultural practice and agricultural science is in stark contrast {{with the fact that}} only very few studies have been conducted so far which have focussed on the framework required to achieve a successful {{transfer of}} knowledge. Both the necessary prerequisites for and potential barriers to the successful {{transfer of knowledge}} regarding the issue of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> have been the topic of this study taking different stakeholder perspectives into account. Based on a socio-cognitive approach to knowledge transfer, different communication techniques (e. g. estimations of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>situations,</b> environmental stakeholder analysis and dialogue cafes) were used to depict and record the views on and understanding of different stakeholders on the issue of <b>animal</b> <b>health.</b> The analysis revealed divergence in the understanding of <b>animal</b> <b>health,</b> unclear responsibilities and self-referential judgements as barriers in the process of knowledge transfer. In the face of these constraints it is concluded that a targeted transfer of knowledge with respect to the issue of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> is considerably compromised, requiring the creation of a framework which would provide the conditions for knowledge transfer. A common strategic goal, limiting the prevalence of production diseases, would help to bypass the current lack of a universally accepted definition of <b>animal</b> <b>health.</b> At the same time, this would function as a quality reference value in line with growing interest in animal welfare in livestock production...|$|R
40|$|The {{consumption}} of industrially produced chicken meat {{has been on}} the rise in Bolivia, {{at the same time as}} the philosophy of Vivir Bien has gained national and international attention. This paper provides detailed insights into the production, distribution, and {{consumption of}} industrial chicken meat in Bolivia (with a focus on the Cochabamba region). It asks how this tendency stands in relationship to the government discourse of Vivir Bien. The paper shows how the concrete policies of the Morales government have fostered the industrialization of the chicken meat sector and the food sector in general. The paper concludes that the discourse of the Morales government masks what is happening “on the ground” in Bolivia. In the case of the chicken meat sector, the concern for food security has been more important to the Morales government than environmental standards, <b>animal</b> <b>health,</b> the <b>situation</b> of small-scale producers, and the identity aspect of food consumption...|$|R
40|$|The {{organic farming}} sector has {{experienced}} a rapid growth over the past decades. The growth has raised the need to address food safety aspects in relation to <b>animal</b> <b>health,</b> the farm <b>situation</b> and the living conditions of animals. Furthermore, the EU-regulations need {{to be put into}} perspectives when food safety is considered. In principle, organic standards on livestock production must secure <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> and food safety, they must comply with common EU standards, they should allow farming systems in harmony with their geographic and cultural localities. They should also be the result of a productive discussion between researchers, policy makers, farmers and consumers. On this background, the objective of SAFO is to improve food safety and <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> in organic livestock production systems through exchange and active communication of research results and conclusions between researchers, policy makers, farmers and the wider stakeholder community, including consumers This will be achieved by: ·	Providing a network in which consumer and policy-maker concerns about food safety and <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> and welfare in the expanding field of organic livestock production can be addressed. ·	Supporting the process of development and implementation of EU-standards on organic livestock production in the diverse climate of agricultural production systems. ...|$|R

40|$|Biological {{emergencies}} such as {{the appearance}} of an exotic transboundary or emerging disease can become disasters. The question that faces Veterinary Services in developing countries is how to balance resources dedicated to active insurance measures, such as border control, surveillance, working with the governments of developing countries, and investing in improving veterinary knowledge and tools, with passive measures, such as contingency funds and vaccine banks. There is strong evidence that the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>situation</b> in developed countries has improved and is relatively stable. In addition, through trade with other countries, developing countries are {{becoming part of the}} international animal health system, the status of which is improving, though with occasional setbacks. However, despite these improvements, the risk of a possible biological disaster still remains, and has increased in recent times because of the threat of bioterrorism.

40|$|Maize is one {{the most}} {{important}} staple foods in the world. However, numerous pests, such as fungal pathogens, e. g., Fusarium verticillioides, and insects, such as Sitophlilus zeamais, attack maize grains during storage. Many F. verticillioides strains produce fumonisins, one of {{the most important}} mycotoxin that causes toxic effects on human and <b>animal</b> <b>health.</b> This <b>situation</b> is aggravated by the insect fungal vector, Sitophlilus zeamais, which contributes to the dispersal of fungal spores, and through feeding damage, provide entry points for fungal infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro bioassays, the antifungal activity on F. verticillioides M 3125 and repellent effects against S. zeamais of ketone terpenes. In addition, we performed Quantitative structure–activity relationship (Q-SAR) studies between physico-chemical properties of ketone terpenes and the antifungal effect. Thymoquinone was the most active compound against F. verticillioides (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration, MIC: 0. 87) affecting the lag phase and the growth rate showing a total inhibition of growth at concentration higher than 2 mM (p < 0. 05). The Q-SAR model revealed that the antifungal activity of ketone compounds is related to the electronic descriptor, Pi energy.

40|$|Th e current <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>situation</b> in Bosnia and Herzegovina {{requires}} the prioritization of diseases {{for the application}} of control measures. One of the diseases requiring high priority is brucellosis of rumi-nants. Brucellosis is a zoonotic infectious disease {{and one of the most}} important zoonoses in the world. Brucellosis has been recognized during the past fi ve decades as an important infectious disease in rumi-nants in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Control and eradication of brucellosis in animals is based on test and slaughter control policy. When the existing brucellosis control program was instituted, the veterinary and animal production sector was almost exclusively owned by the government, an arrangement that promoted compliance with the program and resulted in the successful control of the disease.

Two team of experts were formed to cover the area of study in 10 days. Operating income for the livestock system is concerned mainly in the study. Sheets serving as guides for interviews focused on the following points: the most common diseases, the disease name in the vernacular, the periods of their appearance, the manifestation of these diseases, the major difficulties to fight against these diseases and so on. The individual interviews with farmers and groups (focus) helped to know the level of knowledge of recurrent diseases in the region. The description of the manifestation of certain diseases, their time of onset and the socioeconomic consequences show familiarity among breeders with these conditions.

40|$|The aim of {{this advice}} is to present an {{instrument}} to measure the general health of the livestock population on a yearly basis in Belgium and to monitor its evolution over time. This instrument is, alongside the food safety barometer (Advice 28 - 2010) and the plant health barometer (Advice 10 - 2011), one of the 3 instruments to provide a bird's eye view on the overall status of {{the safety of the}} food chain in Belgium. In order to measure the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>situation,</b> it is proposed to work with a set of indicators, the composition of which may change over time. Quantitative data must be available for these indicators in order to allow for a trend analysis over time. In total, 13 animal health indicators (AHI's) were identified and the results of 12 indicators (for one indicator the results were not yet available) were monitored between 2007 and 2010.

The assessment includes complete characterisation and identification of seed material and ingredients, laboratory and host animal safety and efficacy studies, stability studies, and post-licensing monitoring of field performance.

Using the emergence of bluetongue in northern Europe as an example, the regulatory issues regarding the temporary authorisation of animal vaccination are described. Several conditions must be fulfilled before a temporary authorisation can be granted, e. g. inactivated vaccines should be used in order to exclude reversion to virulence and reassortment between vaccine viruses and/or field strains of the bluetongue virus; decision-making must be supported by scientific evidence and risk analysis; there must be a complete census of the susceptible animals that were vaccinated; vaccination protocols must be adhered to and there must be a scheme allowing for registration, delivery and follow-up of vaccination, and monitoring, analysis and, possibly, adjustment of field use of the vaccination. This temporary authorisation must be replaced by a full authorisation as quickly as possible. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The Caribbean {{region is}} {{composed}} of many scattered and diverse islands that are highly heterogeneous in terms of size, sociodevelopment level, political status, culture, environment, animal production systems, etc. The regular occurrence of natural disasters and sudden environmental and anthropologic changes increase disparity between islands and make the Caribbean particularly sensitive {{to the emergence of}} diseases. Globalization, trade, and animal and human movements increase the risk of disease circulation. Since the failure of veterinary services and surveillance activities in one country may threaten the whole region, a regional approach to building skills in surveillance and control of animal diseases in the Caribbean is essential. The Caribbean Animal Health Network, CaribVETi, is a regional collaborative network involving veterinary services, laboratories, and research institutes in 32 countries/territories as well as numerous regional/international organizations. The objective of this network is to improve the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>situation</b> in the Caribbean. To reach that goal, CaribVET promotes the harmonization and reinforcement of animal disease surveillance and control activities in the Caribbean by organizing training sessions for professionals at different levels (field workers, veterinary services, laboratory technicians) to improve their technical and scientific skills. The capacity building implemented in the region focuses on disease knowledge and epidemiology, surveillance and control protocols, information and data flows, and diagnostic tests. To build an efficient and sustainable network of skills in the Caribbean, evaluations of activities related to disease surveillance and control, as well as personnel are performed at both national and regional levels.

40|$|Livestock play an {{important}} role in the social, cultural and economic environment of the Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs). Currently, the development of the livestock sector in the Pacific region is constrained by a number of factors, including animal health status requirements. So far, the Pacific Islands region has a favourable <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>situation</b> but it is a challenge to maintain a disease free environment in an area composed of 25, 000 islands dispersed over 180 million square kilometres. While most of the PICTs face a critical shortage of veterinarians and have limited financial resources, this study aims to examine ways by which animal disease surveillance in the Pacific Islands region could be better targeted to enable more efficient use of scarce resources in the PICTs. Within this context, a literature review was conducted to synthesize data across studies from peer-reviewed and grey literature on the animal diseases in the Pacific Islands region. Based on the outputs of the meta-analysis, a multicriteria prioritization process was then developed to identify animal diseases perceived to be of importance by decision makers within selected PICTs, at the regional and national levels. Pig and poultry husbandry being of primary importance for the Pacific communities, farmer practices and the movements of pigs and poultry were then examined in four selected PICTs (Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu), using questionnaire survey and social network analysis tools in view of better predicting how diseases could potentially spread in the region. Finally, a combined pig and poultry market chain and risk pathway analysis was conducted in these four PICTs to identify the highest risk areas (risk hotspots) and risky practices and behaviours (risk factors) of animal disease introduction and/or spread, using highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) as model diseases because of their potential importance in the region.

40|$|The Pacific Island {{countries}} and territories (PICTs) are reported {{to be free of}} the most serious infectious livestock diseases which are prevalent {{in other parts of the}} globe, such as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, Foot and Mouth Disease or Rabies. Yet there is a lack of scientifically based evidence to confirm this animal health status. This paper reviews what has been published on diseases of domestic animals in the Pacific Islands region with a particular focus on data from the last 20 years (1992 – 2012). Relevant published papers were identified by a computerized literature search of two electronic databases (PubMed and Web of Knowledge). The latest reports on the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>situation</b> submitted by the PICTs to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) were accessed on the World Animal Health Information Database (WAHID) interface and included in this review. Additionally, paper searches of resources were undertaken at the library of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) in Fiji to retrieve any relevant grey literature for this review. The study eligibility criteria included qualitative or quantitative information on any disease (bacterial, viral, parasitic and other health disorders) affecting domestic terrestrial animals (mammals, reptiles, birds and bees) in any of the 22 PICTs members of the SPC. A total of 158 eligible references were retrieved of which only 77 (48. 7 %) were published since 1992 and analysed in more details. One hundred and one diseases and pathogens were reported on for bee, bird, carabao, cat, cattle, crocodile, deer, dog, donkey, goat, horse, pig, pigeon, poultry and sheep in the Oceania region and in 17 PICTs in particular. The paper gives information about known animal diseases, their reported prevalence and diseases not reported within the Pacific Islands region. The study found retrieved literature on animal diseases in PICTs was scarce and no longer up to date.

40|$|Between 2002 and 2003, {{a survey}} {{established}} {{the status quo}} of organic dairy and beef production. A questionnaire was sent to 750 farms, supplemented by an on-site survey of 100 farms that supplied data on livestock performance, profitability, feeding, animal health and housing conditions. In a num-ber of the 74 dairy farms investigated, deficiencies regarding animal welfare were found, because recommendations for disease prevention had been implemented poorly. In the production of suckler cows only a few problems were identified; the main obstacle to further development of organic cattle rearing {{was considered to be}} the low prices paid to producers. A further study looked at what preventive measures against the major disease groups of mastitis, lameness, metabolic disorders were used in organic dairy farming, collected data on the actual <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>situation</b> and developed preventive animal health concepts that were made available to advisory services. In the same period, a study of the effect of homeopathic remedies for mastitis in dairy cows showed that the use of dry-cow antibiotics can be reduced, but their use cannot be fully eliminated in problem cases. Another status analysis from 2003 to 2004 focused on the state of knowledge on issues such as mastitis, fertility, metabolism and claw disorders in dairy cows and selected diseases in pigs and poultry. The surveys showed that the health status of animals in the organic livestock was not signifi-cantly different from that in conventional animal production and that there was a relatively high inci-dence rate, regardless of the production method. Between 2004 and 2005, a vulnerability assess-ment of the acute need for improvement focusing on small ruminants was carried out, leading to various recommendations. In 2007, building on the previous results, a large, interdisciplinary collaborative project on the health and performance of dairy cows was set up. At the same time the CORE Organic project on health planning for dairy cows (ANIPLAN) was running (also in the UK). The German subproject included the aims to develop animal-health-and-welfare plans (AHW plans) for organic dairy farming, the monitoring of health and welfare of dairy cattle, and the development of advisory tools, including the initiation of regional ‘stable schools’ as an innovative means of communication on the subject of animal health and animal welfare. A further project on stable schools is still ongoing. In 2009, a project was initiated to assist farmers in grazing management {{with the help of a}} web-based decision-tree tool.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to set a {{benchmark}} for a monitoring and surveillance programme on the volumes of the eighteen classes of antimicrobials available and consumed by animals {{for the benefit of}} animal health in South Africa. In setting up such a programme, risk assessment and possible management and communication strategies of the potential health risks emanating from antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from animals and man were considered and the survey was compared with other overseas surveillance programmes established in Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Australia. The aim {{of the study was to}} contribute to the establishment of future surveillance programmes that will provide direction for the prudent and rational use of antimicrobials, involving all the relevant stake-holders, in order to preserve the future efficacy of those antimicrobials that are currently available. Such programmes will harmonize with international initiatives and contribute to the provision of databases for policy recommendations in South Africa. There are several benefits to the implementation of such surveys and addressing topical and relevant issues of antimicrobial use in the domain of animal health and its possible impact on human health. Furthermore, policy decisions to address concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance may be reached in a more informed and judicious manner, with the aim that the efficacy of available antimicrobials may be preserved for use in future generations of humans and animals. The authorized antimicrobials available in South Africa were firstly reviewed and compared with the volumes of antimicrobials supplied by the veterinary pharmaceutical companies. The majority of antimicrobials were registered under the Stock Remedies Act 36 of 1947. It was found that the class of antimicrobial representing the most registered products was the tetracyclines, followed by the penicillins, the sulphonamides, macrolides, lincosamides and pleuromutilins. This correlated well with the volumes of antimicrobials supplied, as these classes of antimicrobials also represented the top four groups of antimicrobials consumed. Eight of the pool of twenty-five veterinary pharmaceutical companies approached provided more detailed information on the volumes of antimicrobials consumed for the years under review, namely 2002 to 2004. The potency of antimicrobials was also requested, in order to establish trends of increasing or decreasing potency of the active ingredients, versus the volumes of antimicrobials supplied. It was established within the scope of this study, that the majority of consumed antimicrobials was from the classes of macrolides, lincosamides, and pleuromutilins, followed by the tetracycline class, the sulphonamide group and fourthly the penicillins. The potency of the active ingredients supplied by the companies did not change and therefore had no impact on the interpretation of antimicrobials consumed. These results give cause for concern in terms of the possibility of cross-resistance between antimicrobials used in the domain of animal health, and those used in the human medical field. There is also another concern, namely the exposure of humans to veterinary drug residues in food, causing modifications in the bacterial ecology of the human gut, thereby leading to a possible perturbation in the protective human gut barrier with overgrowth and invasion of pathogenic bacteria. Although much has been written about the possibility of anaphylactic reactions occurring in sensitized human individuals from â-lactams and macrolides administered in food animals, this issue has been reviewed extensively and it has been concluded that allergies from antimicrobial residues in the diet are extremely rare. The macrolide tylosin was the most extensively sold antimicrobial of all. Tylosin is one of four antimicrobials that was banned by the EU in 1999 because of its structural relatedness to therapeutic antimicrobials used for the treatment of disease in human medicine. The other three classes mentioned above, the penicillins, tetracyclines and sulphonamides are also relevant because of well-documented evidence of the ability to select for resistance or because of their structural relatedness to human therapeutic antimicrobials and their use in humans. The value of sales of antimicrobials were provided by SAAHA (South Africa Animal Health Association) and also scrutinized within the context of this study in order to obtain meaningful data on the national consumption of antimicrobials. However, as discussed in Chapter 5, the data were not of any value within the context of this study because the sales data were provided in monitory terms only. Volumes of sales of feed were also obtained and companies that mix feed approached to ascertain the percentages of antimicrobial medicated feeds consumed. It was ascertained in this survey that 68, 5 % of the grand total of antimicrobials surveyed during 2002 to 2004, were administered as in-feed medications. Tylosin was the most extensively used in-feed antimicrobial, followed by oxytetracycline, zinc bacitracin and olaquindox. This result emphasizes the importance of establishing a monitoring programme for the volumes of antimicrobials used, as many growth promoters used in-feed are administered at sub-therapeutic levels over long periods of time that tend to select for antimicrobial resistance. Whereas 17, 5 % of the total volume of antimicrobials utilized were parenteral antimicrobials, antimicrobials for water medication constituted 12 % of the total. “Other” dosage forms such as the topical, aural, ophthalmic, and aerosol antimicrobials and intra-uterine pessaries and tablets constituted 1, 5 % of the total. Intramammary antimicrobials represented 0, 04 % of the total. In Chapters 1, 5 & 6 the surveillance systems for veterinary antimicrobials used by other countries are discussed and compared. It was concluded that a combination of the surveillance systems applied by Australia and the United Kingdom is the best model (with modifications) to apply to the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>situation</b> in South Africa. Such a surveillance system of the volumes of veterinary antimicrobials consumed should ideally be implemented in conjunction with a veterinary antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programme to generate meaningful data that will contribute to the rational use of antimicrobials in order to preserve the efficacy of the existing antimicrobials in South Africa. Possible trends of antimicrobial usage in animals may be uncovered over time from implementing a programme for the volumes of antimicrobials used and thereby lead to proactive application of rational policies for the veterinary use of antimicrobials. This information can also be compared with international data, in order to harmonize as much as possible with global monitoring programmes of veterinary antimicrobial usage.

40|$|Conclusions: Organic farming has {{committed}} itself to outperforming conventional farming {{in a number of}} areas including animal health. However, organic standards based on minimum requirements do not automatically lead to a high status of animal health that exceeds the level in conventional production and thus, does not in all respects meet consumers’ expectations. Improvements are crucial to support and strengthen consumers’ confidence and their willingness to pay premium prices. These are urgently needed to cover the higher production costs in organic farming and thus ensure a viable organic dairy production. According to previous knowledge, assessments of the quality of organic milk provides inconsistent results and often falls short of expectations as it is often similar or even lower than the quality of conventionally produced milk. In view of the large heterogeneity between organic farms in relation to both living conditions of the farm animals and the status of animal health, it appears to have been a congenital failure of organic agriculture to have neglected the definition of minimum standards with respect to the qualitative outcome of the production process, especially the status of animal health. While farmers as owners are initially responsible for the well-being of their farm animals, they are very limited in their options of decision-making as they, in general, possess little financial flexibility that can be used for improvements. In the past, a clear increase in the productivity of milk production has led to a remarkable decrease of milk prices in relation to the general income from which the consumers have benefited in the first place. While there might have been time periods when the majority of farmers and also farm animals have gained advantage from technical innovations, these times have definitely gone. Dairy cows pay the continuous increase in productivity and milk yield with an increase in the prevalence rates of production diseases and with a decrease in longevity (Knaus, 2009). Farmers are facing a high volatility of milk prices. In recent years, they have gone through a long phase of milk prices which did not cover the total production costs. Correspondingly, the number of dairy farmers who had to quit has increased dramatically. The predominant competition is based on the reduction of prices while widely ignoring the internal and external costs that emerge from these processes. In Europe, the phase-out of the Milk Quota Regulation in 2015 will fuel the competition even more. In face of the shortfall to be financed, the increase in herd size and the decrease in available resources (labor time and investments), there is reason to assume that the situation in the future will become even worse. While the market fails to provide different levels of product and process quality, national governments fail to prevent unfair competition on the market. On the other hand, they are not forced by the majority of voters to initiate and chair changes in the predominating structures of the market. From the farmers’ perspective, to honor a higher health status by premium prices, and to reduce unfair competition are of great importance to improve the unsatisfying situation. The market, however, fails to provide incentives for any quality improvements, often blaming the consumers for not being prepared to pay adequate premium prices. On the other hand, the consumers are not appropriately informed about the current level of product and process quality and are misguided by sales promotion. It is generally accepted in the market economy that the stakeholders being part of the food chain are striving for their own benefit in the first place. In the complex interactions between stakeholders groups, the players generally pose in active as well as in passive roles, and are both victims and offenders. In general, the strength of one actor is based on the weakness of the other stakeholders. While farm animals and farmers are in a very weak position, retailers and supermarkets are in a strong position to beat down the price in order to increase the turnover rates and their profit. Nevertheless, they can only act in such a way because consumer groups are dominated by bargain hunters, and those who are largely ignoring the problems of the other stakeholders, including health and welfare problems of the farm animals. Consumers are able to make a choice between large ranges of products without being able to assess their quality. Expenditures for food in relation to the total budget of a household have dramatically decreased during the last few decades. Hence, consumers in general can afford more expensive food products if their priorities are inclined in this fashion. However, consumers have become used to very low food prices while imagining they are on the safe side concerning the quality issue. So far estimations of consumers with respect to traits of food and process quality are primarily based on associations and on expectations deriving therefrom. They are definitely not evidence based. Large variations in features that are relevant for those who buy organic products meet with large variations in the factual results of quality traits. Currently, the complexity of processes within the food production chain is reduced primarily to the quantifiable size of the price stakeholders receive or have to pay for the intermediate or the final product. However, prices for intermediate or final dairy products are unreal for their part as they do not represent and include the entity of the internal and external costs of the production process, e. g. the worse <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>situation</b> for dairy cows, and the non-covering of the productions costs, let alone the environmental impacts due to the high amounts of nutrient losses and emissions of greenhouse gas caused by the processes of production and processing. While consumers could afford higher milk prices, only few and not enough are willing to face the problems, caused by the impacts of their buying behavior and by the unfair competition within the market. As long as not enough producers are willing to enlighten the consumers about the real production conditions and as long as not enough consumers are not really interested to get an inside view into the production processes, the discrepancies between demands and reality of organic and conventional dairy production is expected to continue. One of the most frequently asked questions in western society: who is to blame for malfunction, does not provoke an easy and obvious answer as all human stakeholders are part of a production system that is based on exploitation of land area, and farm animals, some to a higher and some to a lesser degree. Currently, stakeholder groups involved are not prepared to rethink their dominating pattern of thoughts and are not willing to risk the possible need for changes when having a closer look at the living conditions of farm animals and the impacts on product and process quality. The persisting power is still too high to provide a chance for real improvements. While some stakeholders are trapped in inherent necessities with very small degrees of freedom in decision making, consumers are free to decide on what they spent their money and are benefitting simultaneously from very low food prices. Correspondingly, they could be blamed in the first place for their ignorance towards the impacts of their buying behavior on the production process and on animal health and welfare. Any complaints by consumers with respect to the low level of product and process quality, either in conventional or in organic dairy production, should be rejected. In general, food does not exert a direct influence on human health but is well known for providing both positive and/or negative impacts on the capability of the organism to cope with the various and specific demands. Thus, the slogan “healthy food from healthy animals” represents an abbreviated mental association, not being scientifically sound. However, the slogan is applicable and valid in the way that only milk from healthy cows with healthy udders is delivering the starting product for milk products of top quality. Currently, milk and milk products are not available on the market which derives exclusively and evidence based from healthy cows. If consumers really want food from healthy cows they have to establish a corresponding demand and have to reject those products that do not fulfill this demand. ...|$|E
