50|$|In industry, <b>a</b> <b>packed</b> {{column is}} <b>a</b> type of <b>packed</b> bed used to perform {{separation}} processes, such as absorption, stripping, and distillation. <b>A</b> <b>packed</b> column is <b>a</b> pressure vessel that has <b>a</b> <b>packed</b> section.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>packing</b> {{density or}} <b>packing</b> {{fraction}} of <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> in some space is {{the fraction of}} the space filled by the figures making up the packing. In packing problems, the objective is usually to obtain <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> of the greatest possible density.|$|R
50|$|Aristotle {{claimed that}} tetrahedra could fill space completely. In 2006, Conway and Torquato showed that <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> {{fraction}} about 72% {{can be obtained}} by constructing <b>a</b> non-Bravais lattice <b>packing</b> of tetrahedra (with multiple particles with generally different orientations per repeating unit), and thus they showed that the best tetrahedron <b>packing</b> cannot be <b>a</b> lattice <b>packing</b> (with one particle per repeating unit such that each particle has a common orientation). These packing constructions almost doubled the optimal Bravais-lattice-packing fraction 36.73% obtained by Hoylman. In 2007 and 2010, Chaikin and coworkers experimentally showed that tetrahedron-like dice can randomly <b>pack</b> in <b>a</b> finite container up to <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> fraction between 75% and 76%. In 2008, Chen was the first to propose <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> of hard, regular tetrahedra that packed more densely than spheres, demonstrating numerically <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> fraction of 77.86%. A further improvement was made in 2009 by Torquato and Jiao, who compressed Chen's structure using a computer algorithm to <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> fraction of 78.2021%.|$|R
5|$|Actors and props from Doppelgänger would re-appear {{in a later}} Anderson TV series, UFO. Although the Andersons {{incorporated}} adult themes {{into their}} script {{in an effort to}} distinguish the film from their children's TV productions, cuts to more mature content, in this case a shot of <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> of contraceptive pills, were required to permit an A and, later, PG certificate from the BBFC.|$|E
5|$|As {{hunting with}} beagles {{was seen as}} ideal for young people, many of the British public schools {{traditionally}} maintained beagle packs. Protests were lodged against Eton's use of beagles for hunting as early as 1902 but the pack is still in existence today, and <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> used by Imperial College in Wye, Kent was stolen by the Animal Liberation Front in 2001. School and university packs are still maintained by Eton, Marlborough, Wye, Radley, the Royal Agricultural University and Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Edward Bernays {{helped the}} Lucky Strike {{cigarette}} brand increase its sales among the female demographic. Research showed {{that women were}} reluctant to carry <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> of Lucky Strike cigarettes, because the brand's green color scheme clashed with popular fashion choices. Bernays persuaded fashion designers, charity events, interior designers and others to popularize the color green. He also positioned cigarettes as Torches of Freedom that represent rebellion against the norms of a male-dominated society.|$|E
5000|$|In late 2009, a new, {{much simpler}} family of {{packings}} with <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> fraction of 85.47% {{was discovered by}} Kallus, Elser, and Gravel. These packings were also the basis of <b>a</b> slightly improved <b>packing</b> obtained by Torquato and Jiao {{at the end of}} 2009 with <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> fraction of 85.55%, and by Chen, Engel, and Glotzer in early 2010 with <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> fraction of 85.63%. [...] The Chen, Engel and Glotzer result currently stands as the densest known packing of hard, regular tetrahedra.|$|R

40|$|A {{collection}} of non-overlapping spheres {{in the space}} is called <b>a</b> <b>packing.</b> Two spheres {{are said to be}} neighbours if they have a boundary point in common. <b>A</b> <b>packing</b> is called k-regular if each sphere has exactly k neighbours. We are concerned with the following question. What is the minimum number of not necessarily congruent spheres which may form <b>a</b> k-regular <b>packing?</b> In general, for which natural numbers n and k does there exist <b>a</b> connected k-regular <b>packing</b> of exactly n spheres...|$|R
5|$|In 2015, Soule {{composed}} a Dota 2 music pack, {{along with his}} brother Julian. The soundtrack was available {{as part of the}} Compendium, <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> of digitally-distributed content that funded the prize pool for The International 2015 tournament, which took place in August 2015 and ultimately featured the largest prize-pool in e-sports history, with over $18,000,000 in total.|$|E
5|$|On both fronts, {{the horse}} was also used as <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> animal. Because railway lines could not {{withstand}} artillery bombardments, horses carried ammunition and supplies between the railheads and the rear trenches, though the horses generally were not used in the actual trench zone. This role of horses was critical, and thus horse fodder was the single largest commodity shipped to the front by some countries. Following the war, many cavalry regiments were converted to mechanised, armoured divisions, with light tanks developed to perform many of the cavalry's original roles.|$|E

Soon she becomes frightened after Tigerstar discusses his plans to rule the forest with his Clanmates, including hiring BloodClan and setting <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> of dogs on ThunderClan. Extremely scared and changing her mind, Sasha flees, but before she can get far she is approached by Tigerstar who asks if she will join ShadowClan.|$|E
40|$|For a set D of polyominoes, <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> of {{the plane}} with D is a maximal set of copies of polyominoes from D that are not overlapping. <b>A</b> <b>packing</b> with {{smallest}} density is called clumsy <b>packing.</b> We give <b>an</b> example of a set D such that any clumsy packing is aperiodic. In addition, we compute the smallest possible density of <b>a</b> clumsy <b>packing</b> when D consist of a single polyomino of a given size and show that one could always construct <b>a</b> periodic <b>packing</b> arbitrarily close in density to the clumsy packing...|$|R

50|$|A {{partition}} of points into lines {{is called a}} spread, and the {{partition of}} the spreads of a geometry is called <b>a</b> <b>packing.</b> When Hirschfeld considered the problem in his Finite Projective Spaces of Three Dimensions(1985), he noted that a solution corresponds to <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> of PG(3,2), essentially as described by Conwell above.|$|R
5|$|Set in summer, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland {{opens with}} Alice on the {{riverbank}} with her elder sister. She falls down a rabbit hole into Wonderland after following the White Rabbit. Meeting many characters and changing her size several times, she eventually finds herself at {{the trial of the}} Knave of Hearts as a witness. Ordered to leave by the King and Queen of Hearts, Alice argues with them, eventually claiming that they are just <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> of cards. As they swarm her, Alice awakens {{on the riverbank}} and realizes that it was just a dream.|$|E
5|$|The British Secret Service agent James Bond {{is asked}} by his superior, M, {{to join him}} at M's club, Blades. A club member, the multi-millionaire {{businessman}} Sir Hugo Drax, is winning considerable money playing bridge, seemingly against the odds. M suspects Drax is cheating, and while claiming indifference, is concerned as to why a multi-millionaire and national hero would cheat. Bond confirms Drax's deception and manages to turn the tables—aided by <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> of stacked cards—and wins £15,000.|$|E
5|$|The first road to use {{the general}} {{alignment}} of modern Route 14 was called the El Camino Sierra, or Sierra Highway, which extended from Los Angeles to Lake Tahoe. A dirt road was completed in the 1910s from what had been <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> trail. The Los Angeles Times declared El Camino Sierra complete in 1931, when the portion from Mojave to the Owens Valley, along modern US 395, was paved.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{integrating}} is easiest with two rats of young age, generally {{less than six}} months old. The process of integrating is most difficult with two or more adult male rats, as adult males are the least likely to accept new cage mates, especially after an alpha has been established. Unless there is an issue integrating rats together, owners should always keep them in a group of at least three, as rats live in packs and <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> starts with three animals.|$|E
5|$|Tom Pryce's helmet design was, in {{comparison}} to later drivers', simple and restrained. His helmet was plain white all over until 1970. At that year's race at Castle Combe, his father asked Pryce to make his helmet stand out more {{so that he could}} easily identify him in <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> of cars. Pryce added five black vertical lines to his helmet, placed just above his visor. From that time the only change to this design was the addition of a Welsh flag to the side of his helmet in 1974.|$|E

5|$|While an Australian Cattle Dog {{generally}} works silently, it will bark {{in alarm}} or to attract attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking {{can be a}} sign of boredom or frustration, although research has shown that pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in a noisy environment. It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a pecking order can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives in <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> with other dogs.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 28 games {{distributed}} on 11 different game cards were released for the Magnavox Odyssey. 13 games were {{included with the}} console—a set of 12 in America and {{a different set of}} 10 in other countries—with 6 others available for purchase either individually for US$5.49 or in <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> for US$24.99; the additional games primarily used the same game cards with different screen overlays and instructions. Another game, Percepts, was available for free to players that sent in a survey card. A light gun accessory, Shooting Gallery, was available for purchase, and included four games on two cards that used the rifle. A final four games were released for sale in 1973, designed wholly or in part by Don Emry. The games do not enforce game rules or keep track of score; that is left up to the players.|$|E
5|$|Cancer {{screening}} uses {{medical tests}} to detect disease in {{large groups of}} people who have no symptoms. For individuals with high risk of developing lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) screening can detect cancer and give a person options to respond to {{it in a way that}} prolongs life. This form of screening reduces the chance of death from lung cancer by an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%). High risk people are those age 55–74 who have smoked equivalent amount of <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> of cigarettes daily for 30 years including time within the past 15 years.|$|E
