In this problem, one must choose time slots for the edges of a wireless communications network so that each node of the network can communicate with each neighboring node without interference. Using a strong edge coloring (and using two time slots for each edge color, one for each direction) would solve the problem but might use more time slots than necessary. Instead, they seek a coloring of the directed graph formed by doubling each undirected edge of the network, with the property that each directed edge [...] has a different color from the edges that go out from [...] and from the neighbors of [...] They propose a heuristic for this problem based on a distributed algorithm for -edge-coloring together with a postprocessing phase that reschedules edges that might interfere with each other.|$|E
