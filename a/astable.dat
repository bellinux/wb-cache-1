50|$|An <b>astable</b> {{multivibrator}} {{consists of}} two amplifying stages connected in a positive feedback loop by two capacitive-resistive coupling networks.

50|$|<b>Astable</b> multivibrator: In {{this type}} the {{capacitor}} is both charged and discharged slowly through a resistor, so the output waveform {{consists of two}} parts, an increasing ramp and a decreasing ramp. The voltage across the capacitor is a triangle waveform, while the current through the switching device is a square wave.|$|E
50|$|By {{using an}} RC network to add slow {{negative}} {{feedback to the}} inverting Schmitt trigger, a relaxation oscillator is formed. The feedback through the RC network causes the Schmitt trigger output to oscillate in an endless symmetric square wave (i.e., the Schmitt trigger in this configuration is an <b>astable</b> multivibrator).|$|E
50|$|<b>Astable</b> {{multivibrator}} - {{a circuit}} with two unstable states, {{in which the}} output periodically switches {{back and forth between}} the states. The time it remains in each state is determined by the time constant of an RC circuit. Therefore, it is a relaxation oscillator, and can produce square waves or triangle waves.|$|E
50|$|The <b>astable</b> configuration, {{with two}} resistors, cannot produce a 50% duty cycle. To produce a 50% duty cycle, {{eliminate}} R1, disconnect pin 7 and connect the supply end of R2 to pin 3, the output pin. This circuit {{is similar to}} using an inverter gate as an oscillator, but with fewer components than the <b>astable</b> configuration, and a much higher power output than a TTL or CMOS gate. The duty cycle for either the 555 or inverter-gate timer will not be precisely 50% and will change based off any load that the output is also driving while high (longer duty cycles for greater loads) {{due to the fact}} the timing network is supplied from the devices output pin, which has different internal resistances depending on whether it is in the high or low state (high side drivers tend to be more resistive).|$|E
5000|$|The {{first and}} most widely used {{relaxation}} oscillator circuit, the <b>astable</b> multivibrator, was invented in 1917 by French engineers Henri Abraham and Eugene Bloch. [...] They called their cross-coupled, dual vacuum tube circuit a multivibrateur, because the square-wave signal it produced was rich in harmonics, compared to the sinusoidal signal of other vacuum tube oscillators.|$|E
50|$|In these {{applications}} a latching {{continuity tester}} is used. A more complex device, it detects intermittent opens and shorts {{as well as}} steady-state conditions. These devices contain a fast acting electronic switch (generally a Schmitt trigger) forming a gated <b>astable</b> oscillator which detects and locks (latches) the indicator on an intermittent condition {{with a duration of}} less than a millisecond.|$|E

50|$|An <b>astable</b> {{multivibrator}} can be synchronized to {{an external}} chain of pulses. A single pair of active devices {{can be used}} to divide a reference by a large ratio, however, the stability of the technique is poor owing to the variability of the power supply and the circuit elements. A division ratio of 10, for example, is easy to obtain but not dependable. Chains of bistable flip-flops provide more predictable division, at the cost of more active elements.|$|E
5000|$|A {{multivibrator}} is {{an electronic}} circuit used {{to implement a}} variety of simple two-state devices such as relaxation oscillators, timers and flip-flops. It consists of two amplifying devices (transistors, vacuum tubes or other devices) cross-coupled by resistors or capacitors. The first multivibrator circuit, the <b>astable</b> multivibrator oscillator, was invented by Henri Abraham and Eugene Bloch during World War I. [...] They called their circuit a [...] "multivibrator" [...] because its output waveform was rich in harmonics.|$|E
50|$|Stable region (green) (illustrated by line L1): When {{the load}} line lies in this region, it intersects the I-V curve {{at one point}} Q1. For nonreactive {{circuits}} it is a stable equilibrium (poles in the LHP) so the circuit is stable. Negative resistance amplifiers operate in this region. However, due to hysteresis, with an energy storage device like a capacitor or inductor the circuit can become unstable to make a nonlinear relaxation oscillator (<b>astable</b> multivibrator) or a monostable multivibrator.|$|E
50|$|In <b>astable</b> mode, the 555 timer {{puts out}} a {{continuous}} stream of rectangular pulses having a specified frequency. Resistor R1 is connected between VCC and the discharge pin (pin 7) and another resistor (R2) is connected between the discharge pin (pin 7), and the trigger (pin 2) and threshold (pin 6) pins that {{share a common}} node. Hence the capacitor is charged through R1 and R2, and discharged only through R2, since pin 7 has low impedance to ground during output low intervals of the cycle, therefore discharging the capacitor.|$|E
50|$|This {{latch circuit}} {{is similar to}} an <b>astable</b> multivibrator, except {{that there is no}} charge or {{discharge}} time, due to the absence of capacitors. Hence, when the circuit is switched on, if Q1 is on, its collector is at 0 V. As a result, Q2 gets switched off. This results in more than half +V volts being applied to R4 causing current into the base of Q1, thus keeping it on. Thus, the circuit remains stable in a single state continuously. Similarly, Q2 remains on continuously, if it happens to get switched on first.|$|E
50|$|This {{relaxation}} oscillator is a hysteretic oscillator, named {{this way because}} of the hysteresis created by the positive feedback loop implemented with the comparator (similar to, but different from, an op-amp). A circuit that implements this form of hysteretic switching {{is known as a}} Schmitt trigger. Alone, the trigger is a bistable multivibrator. However, the slow negative feedback added to the trigger by the RC circuit causes the circuit to oscillate automatically. That is, the addition of the RC circuit turns the hysteretic bistable multivibrator into an <b>astable</b> multivibrator.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Astable</b> (free-running) mode - the 555 {{can operate}} as an {{electronic}} oscillator. Uses include LED and lamp flashers, pulse generation, logic clocks, tone generation, security alarms, pulse position modulation and so on. The 555 {{can be used as}} a simple ADC, converting an analog value to a pulse length (e.g., selecting a thermistor as timing resistor allows the use of the 555 in a temperature sensor and the period of the output pulse is determined by the temperature). The use of a microprocessor-based circuit can then convert the pulse period to temperature, linearize it and even provide calibration means.|$|E
50|$|The {{regenerative}} detector in {{the radio}} hat had adequate sensitivity to receive stations much more distant than the stipulated twenty-mile range, but distant stations {{would not have had}} a strong enough carrier to block the oscillations and so would be received with an objectionable heterodyne, audible as an <b>astable</b> squealing noise. Furthermore, the loop antenna was somewhat directional. This was a limitation for a portable radio; the signal level could vary when the listener turned their head. If the target station was accidentally nulled, the carrier signal could fall below blocking level, resulting in an annoying squealing heterodyne similar to that present on stations outside the normal range of the radio.|$|E
50|$|The first {{multivibrator}} circuit, {{the classic}} <b>astable</b> multivibrator oscillator (also called a plate-coupled multivibrator) was first described by Henri Abraham and Eugene Bloch in Publication 27 of the French Ministère de la Guerre, and in Annales de Physique 12, 252 (1919). Since it produced a square wave, {{in contrast to}} the sine wave generated by most other oscillator circuits of the time, its output contained many harmonics above the fundamental frequency, which could be used for calibrating high frequency radio circuits. For this reason Abraham and Bloch called it a multivibrateur. It is a predecessor of the Eccles-Jordan trigger which was derived from the circuit a year later.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{relaxation}} oscillator circuit, the <b>astable</b> multivibrator, {{was invented by}} Henri Abraham and Eugene Bloch using vacuum tubes during World War I. [...] Balthasar van der Pol first distinguished relaxation oscillations from harmonic oscillations, originated the term [...] "{{relaxation oscillator}}", and derived the first mathematical model of a relaxation oscillator, the influential Van der Pol oscillator model, in 1920. [...] Van der Pol borrowed the term relaxation from mechanics; the discharge of the capacitor {{is analogous to the}} process of stress relaxation, the gradual disappearance of deformation and return to equilibrium in a inelastic medium. [...] Relaxation oscillators can be divided into two classes ...|$|E
50|$|A similar {{relaxation}} oscillator {{can be built}} with a 555 timer IC (acting in <b>astable</b> mode) that {{takes the place of}} the neon bulb above. That is, when a chosen capacitor is charged to a design value, (e.g., 2/3 of the power supply voltage) comparators within the 555 timer flip a transistor switch that gradually discharges that capacitor through a chosen resistor (RC Time Constant) to ground. At the instant the capacitor falls to a sufficiently low value (e.g., 1/3 of the power supply voltage), the switch flips to let the capacitor charge up again. The popular 555's comparator design permits accurate operation with any supply from 5 to 15 volts or even wider.|$|E
50|$|In 1899-1900, he {{measured}} {{very short}} time constants of the Kerr effect, a few billionths of a second, or about {{the time it takes}} light to travel one meter. Between 1911 et1914, he made the first measurements of the actual speed of electromagnetic wave propagation, measuring the propagation times between remote stations (collaboration with Alexandre Dufour and G. Ferrie). Mobilized in 1914 in the Department of Military Telegraphy, under the direction of Commander Ferrie, in collaboration with Eugene Bloch he developed the first French triode amplifying vacuum tube for radio reception. He and Bloch also invented the <b>astable</b> multivibrator. The harmonics produced by this device provided the first accurate technique for measuring radio frequencies, which was employed in 1916 in the French and English armies, and in the U.S. Army after 1917.|$|E
5000|$|The circuit has two <b>astable</b> (unstable) {{states that}} change {{alternatively}} with maximum transition rate {{because of the}} [...] "accelerating" [...] positive feedback. It is implemented by the coupling capacitors that instantly transfer voltage changes because the voltage across a capacitor cannot suddenly change. In each state, one transistor is switched on {{and the other is}} switched off. Accordingly, one fully charged capacitor discharges (reverse charges) slowly thus converting the time into an exponentially changing voltage. At the same time, the other empty capacitor quickly charges thus restoring its charge (the first capacitor acts as a time-setting capacitor and the second prepares to play this role in the next state). The circuit operation is {{based on the fact that}} the forward-biased base-emitter junction of the switched-on bipolar transistor can provide a path for the capacitor restoration.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the zero}} {{crossing}} detector, the detector with hysteresis does not switch when Vin is zero, rather the output becomes Vsat+ when Va becomes positive and Vsat- when Va becomes negative. Further {{examination of the}} Va equation reveals that Vin can exceed zero (positive or negative) by a certain magnitude before {{the output of the}} detector is caused to switch. By adjusting the value of R1, the magnitude of Vin that will cause the detector to switch can be increased or decreased. Hysteresis is useful in various applications. It has better noise immunity than the level detector, so it is used in interface circuits. Its positive feedback has a faster transition, so it is used in timing applications such as frequency counters. It is also used in <b>astable</b> multivibrators found in instruments such as function generators.|$|E
50|$|Atari Punk console is an <b>astable</b> {{square wave}} {{oscillator}} driving a monostable oscillator {{that creates a}} single (square) pulse. There are two controls, one for {{the frequency of the}} oscillator and one to control the width of the pulse. The controls are usually potentiometers but the circuit can also be controlled by light, temperature, pressure etc. by replacing a potentiometer with a suitable sensor (e.g., photo resistor for light sensitivity). Most of the time there is also a power switch (often a toggle switch) and a volume knob. The circuit is a simple DIY noisemaker circuit that is relatively inexpensive and easy to build, easily adaptable and is configurable in many ways. It has been built into a wide variety of cases, from metal IKEA bowls to light bulbs, an old Atari mouse or joystick. Its flexibility has led to wide scale popularity among electronics enthusiasts. It is often suggested as a good circuit to build for beginners.|$|E
