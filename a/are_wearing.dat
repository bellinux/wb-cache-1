5|$|A precise {{description}} {{and interpretation of}} the work has remained elusive since its initial discovery in the 19th century. Scholars agree on some aspects and disagree on others. British Greek art scholar Martin Robertson notes that both women can be seen wearing the tubular peplos garment common to the Classical period. According to the descriptive text found in the Atlas database of the exhibited works of art at the Louvre, the women also <b>are</b> <b>wearing</b> a kekryphalos, a hairnet in the Greco-Roman hairstyle, and appear to hold a type of flower, perhaps poppy or pomegranate. One {{of the women in}} the stele carries what resembles a bag, presumed to be carrying seeds in the interpretation.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Kazuaki Kiriya. It opens with the camera traveling through a tunnel full of lights, and includes the song's title and Utada's name. For {{the first part of}} the song, it has Utada singing into a microphone, whilst walking inside the head of a spacecraft. The spacecraft exits the station, and flies all over a futuristic cityscape. The first verse has Utada as a hostess on the spacecraft, helping and serving the passengers in a dancing manner; the passengers <b>are</b> <b>wearing</b> theatrical clothing and headpieces that cover their faces. During the pre-chorus, Utada sings in front of a forest-like backdrop, whilst a stop-motion animation of her is walking through the woods, observing disfigured creatures. The chorus has Utada and the passengers marching across a bridge, while continuous intercut scenes of Utada outside a party is seen.|$|E
5|$|The {{worship of}} Shiva became popular in Central Asia through the Hephthalite Empire, and Kushan Empire. Shaivism was also popular in Sogdia and the Kingdom of Yutian as found {{from the wall}} {{painting}} from Penjikent on the river Zervashan. In this depiction, Shiva is portrayed with a sacred halo and a sacred thread ("Yajnopavita"). He is clad in tiger skin while his attendants <b>are</b> <b>wearing</b> Sogdian dress. A panel from Dandan Oilik shows Shiva in His Trimurti form with Shakti kneeling on her right thigh. Another site in the Taklamakan Desert depicts him with four legs, seated cross-legged on a cushioned seat supported by two bulls. It is also noted that Zoroastrian wind god Vayu-Vata took on the iconographic appearance of Shiva.|$|E

5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam are bipedal Pokémon {{characterized}} by their humanoid body structure and somewhat fox-like appearance. They {{look like they}} <b>are</b> <b>wearing</b> armor, as they have two pauldron-shaped pieces on their shoulders and a fauld-like piece around their chest. Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam have three fingers on each hand and three toes on each foot, with two toes in the front on either side {{and one in the}} back near the ankle. Abra and Kadabra also have thick tails the same gold color as the rest of its body, except for a brown band located near the top. Kadabra and Alakazam have relatively large mustaches, which are shorter in female species. Kadabra has a red star-shaped symbol on its forehead, and three red wavy lines on its fauld-like torso. After evolving into Alakazam, the creatures no longer have the Zener markings and tails, while their heads become much larger, resulting in extremely powerful mental powers. Alakazam undergoes slight changes upon Mega Evolving into Mega Alakazam, as its overall color scheme becomes slightly paler, it gains a white beard alongside its now white mustache, a considerably thinner torso, and a red gem-like organ on its forehead.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy X-2 reintroduces the series' classic {{character}} class system (seen previously in Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy Tactics) through {{the inclusion of}} dresspheres. Because the party never grows beyond three characters, switching characters during battle is unnecessary. Instead, the player can switch {{character class}}es, providing access to different abilities. The playable characters are allowed to equip one dressphere at a time, each providing different battle functions and abilities. Characters can learn new skills for each dressphere {{with the use of}} Ability Points (AP). AP is obtained by defeating enemies and by the use of items and abilities for that sphere. Abilities to be learned are chosen in the main menu. During battle, AP is given to that ability until it is learned. Each character can access as many as six dresspheres at a time, depending on the specific properties of the Garment Grid they <b>are</b> <b>wearing.</b> The Garment Grid is a placard featuring a geometric shape connected by nodes. These nodes are slots that can be filled with dresspheres, allowing characters to change character classes during their turn in battle. Most Garment Grids possess Gates that when passed through grant the user a complimentary buff.|$|E

5|$|In {{the image}} {{selected}} by McCartney, the group {{walk across the}} street in single file from left to right, with Lennon leading, followed by Starr, McCartney, and Harrison. McCartney is barefoot and {{out of step with the}} other members. Apart from Harrison, the group <b>are</b> <b>wearing</b> suits designed by Tommy Nutter. To the left of the picture, parked next to the zebra crossing, is a white Volkswagen Beetle which belonged to one of the people living in the block of flats across from the recording studio. After the album was released, the number plate (LMW 281F) was stolen repeatedly from the car. In 1986, the car was sold at auction for £2,530 and in 2001 was on display in a museum in Germany. The man standing on the pavement to the right of the picture is Paul Cole (7 July 1911– 13 February 2008), an American tourist unaware he had been photographed until he saw the album cover months later. On the original cover, McCartney holds a cigarette; in 2003 several US poster companies airbrushed this cigarette out of the image, without permission from either Apple or McCartney.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{revealed}} that Bieber and Flatts would be shooting a video for the remix {{version of the}} song when TMZ revealed photos on Bieber on set of the video shoot. The photos pictured Bieber after a dramatic haircut, changing his trademark style over the previous two years. The video premiered during the ABC special, Rascal Flatts: Nothing Like This Presented by JC Penney, which aired March 12, 2011. The video begins with Rascal Flatts arriving in a Cadillac Escalade to a studio. Inside, they are directed to Bieber, who is playing the keyboard. Bieber then sings his lines, playing guitar, and is joined by Joe Don Rooney also on guitar, and Jay DeMarcus now on keyboard. The woman who directed the band into the studio now directs them and Bieber into another room with lights, to film the video. Gary LeVox then sings his lines, joined by Bieber for the chorus while Rooney is on guitar and DeMarcus playing a grand piano. All <b>are</b> <b>wearing</b> black, with Bieber in particular wearing a leather jacket, his signature dog tag, and grey Supras sneakers. During the sequence of the video, more behind-the-scenes action is shown, before it ends with only Bieber's silhouette shown, as his jacket is on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The club is {{associated}} with two very different colour schemes—white and black (first permanently adopted in 1920), and orange, navy and white (first used in 1973, and worn by the team as of the 2015–16 season). Luton mainly wore a combination of light blue and white before 1920, when white shirts and black shorts were first adopted. These colours were retained for over half a century, with the colour of the socks varying between white and black, until Luton changed to orange, navy and white {{at the start of}} the 1973–74 season. Luton began playing in white shirts, shorts and socks in 1979, with the orange and navy motif reduced to trim; navy shorts were adopted in 1984. This palette was retained until the 1999–2000 season, when the team played in orange shirts and blue shorts. From 2000 to 2008, Luton returned to white shirts and black shorts; orange was included as trim until 2007. The white, navy and orange palette favoured in the 1980s was brought back in 2008, following the results of a club poll, but a year later the colours were changed yet again, this time to a predominantly orange strip with white shorts. Navy shorts were readopted in 2011. Luton <b>are</b> <b>wearing</b> orange shirts, navy shorts and white socks during the 2015–16 season.|$|E
