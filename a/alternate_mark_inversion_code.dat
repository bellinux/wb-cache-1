40|$|The novel {{concept of}} spatio-Temporal {{modulation}} of Nyquist pulses is introduced, {{and the resulting}} wave-packets are termed Nyquist Localized Waves (LWs). Ideal Nyquist LWs belong to the generic family of LW solutions and can propagate indefinitely in unbounded media without attenuation or chromatic dispersion. The possibility of modulating Nyquist LWs for free-space optical (FSO) communication systems is demonstrated using two different modulation techniques. The first technique is on-off keying (OOK) with <b>alternate</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion</b> (AMI) <b>coding</b> for 1 -bit per symbol transmission, and the second one is 16 -Ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16 -QAM) for 4 -bits per symbol transmission. Aspects related to the performance, detection and generation of the spatio-Temporally coupled wave-packets are discussed and future research directions are outlined. © 2012 Optical Society of America...|$|R
5000|$|One kind of bipolar {{encoding}} is a paired disparity code, {{of which}} the simplest example is <b>alternate</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion.</b> In this <b>code,</b> a binary 0 is encoded as zero volts, as in unipolar encoding, whereas a binary 1 is encoded alternately as a positive voltage or a negative voltage. The name arose because, {{in the context of}} a T-carrier, a binary '1' is referred to as a [...] "mark", while a binary '0' is called a [...] "space".|$|R
50|$|Appendix III of G.961 {{specifies}} a {{line system}} based on the Time Compression Multiplex (TCM) duplex method and an <b>alternate</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion</b> (AMI) line <b>code.</b> The AMI line code maps one input bit to one ternary symbol. Like with MMS43, the ternary symbol can either be a positive (+), zero (0), or negative (-) voltage. A 0 bit is represented by a zero voltage, while a 1 bit is alternatingly represented by a positive and a negative voltage, resulting in a DC-bias free signal. In a 2.5 ms interval, each side can send a 1.178 ms frame representing 360 bits of 2B+D data. To the 2B+D data, an 8-bit preamble, 8 bits from the CL channel, {{as well as a}} parity bit are added, yielding a frame size of 377 bits and a baud rate of 320 kilobaud. The CL channel is used for operations and maintenance, as well transmitting a 12-bit CRC covering 4 frames.|$|R
50|$|Legacy T1 {{carriers}} operated {{using the}} <b>alternate</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion</b> (AMI) line <b>code,</b> more recently also B8ZS, on two wire pairs. Each wire pair was operated in simplex, that is, one wire pair {{was used for}} transmission in each direction. The Nyquist frequency of a 1.544 megabaud signal is 772 kHz. Higher frequencies are attenuated more strongly than lower frequencies, motivating the use of technologies that reduce the signal bandwidth. In HDSL, full duplex by means of echo cancellation is used, enabling simultaneous transmission in both directions {{on each of the}} two wire pairs, effectively reducing the symbol rate by a factor two. Through the use of 2B1Q encoding, two bits are combined to one symbol, further reducing the symbol rate by a factor of two. For this two-pair 2B1Q variant of HDSL, framing increases the bitrate from 1.544 Mbit/s to 1.568 Mbit/s, resulting in a symbol rate of 392 kilobaud and a Nyquist frequency of 196 kHz.|$|R

50|$|The term digital {{baseband}} modulation (or digital baseband transmission) {{is synonymous}} to line codes. These are methods to transfer a digital bit stream over an analog baseband channel (a.k.a. lowpass channel) using a pulse train, i.e. a discrete number of signal levels, by directly modulating the voltage or current on a cable or serial bus. Common examples are unipolar, non-return-to-zero (NRZ), Manchester and <b>alternate</b> <b>mark</b> <b>inversion</b> (AMI) codings.|$|R

Pulses (which represent ones) always alternate in polarity, so that if, for example two positive pulses are received in succession, the receiver knows that an error occurred (a violation) in that one or more bits were either added or deleted from the original signal.|$|R
50|$|The signal {{transmitted}} on a T1 line, {{referred to}} as the DS1 signal, consists of serial bits transmitted at the rate of 1.544 Mbps.

Digital Signal Designation is the classification of digital bit rates in the digital multiplex hierarchy used in transport of telephone signals from one location to another. DS-1 is a communications protocol for multiplexing the bitstreams of up to 24 telephone calls, along with two special bits: a framing bit (for frame synchronization) and a maintenance-signaling bit, transmitted over a digital circuit called T1. T1's maximum data transmission rate is 1.544 megabits per second.|$|R

We utilize the concept of sparsity or compressibility to develop an new generation of <b>inversion</b> <b>codes</b> for the Stokes parameters. The <b>inversion</b> <b>code</b> uses numerical optimization techniques based on the idea of proximal algorithms to impose sparsity.
