5|$|Modern historiographical {{practice}} {{distinguishes between}} chattel slavery (personal possession, where the slave {{was regarded as}} a piece of property as opposed to a mobile member of society) versus land-bonded groups such as the penestae of Thessaly or the Spartan helots, who were more like medieval serfs (an enhancement to real estate).

5|$|By early 1933, Bell's {{opinion on}} the NFL had changed, {{and he wanted to}} become <b>an</b> <b>owner</b> of a team based in Philadelphia. After being advised by the NFL that a {{prerequisite}} to a franchise being rendered in Philadelphia was that the Pennsylvania Blue Laws would have to be mollified, he was the force majeure in lobbying to getting the laws deprecated. He borrowed funds from Frances Upton, partnered with Wray, and he procured the rights to a franchise in Philadelphia which he christened as the Philadelphia Eagles.|$|E
5|$|In 1456 Reginald de Gray, {{the owner}} of the Manor itself, sold the land to a group {{including}} Thomas Bryan. A few months later, the other members signed deeds of release, granting the property solely to Thomas Bryan. Bryan acted as either a feoffee or <b>an</b> <b>owner</b> representing the governing body of the Inn (there are some records suggesting he may have been a Bencher at this point) but in 1493 he transferred the ownership by charter to a group including Sir Robert Brudenell and Thomas Wodeward, reverting the ownership of the Inn partially back to the Gray family.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} anecdotal reports of dogs, horses and {{dolphins}} killing themselves. There, however, {{has been little}} scientific study of animal suicide. Animal suicide is usually put down to romantic human interpretation and is not generally thought to be intentional.

5|$|Though {{his career}} spanned the {{desegregation}} and reintegration of the NFL, as <b>an</b> <b>owner,</b> {{he never had}} an African American on any of his teams, but Bert Jr. believed the mere discussion of whether his father was prejudiced was absurd. Bell's handling of the merger with the AAFC was acclaimed as a personal triumph. Although {{he did not have}} the wherewithal to prevent the wholesale betting on games, he was proactive in ensuring games were not tampered with by gamblers, and he created the foundation of the contemporary NFL anti-gambling policy.|$|E
5|$|Unusually for an aristocrat of the period, Bute owned {{almost all}} of his lands fully, as <b>an</b> <b>owner</b> in fee simple, rather than having his rights diluted through {{arrangements}} with trustees. When he married in 1818, Bute placed his English and Wales estates into a trustee arrangement for any future children, but this agreement expired with Lady Maria's death in 1842; when he remarried in 1845 a similar trustee agreement was set up, although in this version the Glamorgan estates were administered separately from his other holdings in England and Wales. Bute continued to run his network of estates and estate managers personally, helped by Onesipherus Bruce, a barrister-agent and close friend.|$|E
5|$|As the stadium's {{construction}} got underway, the NFL {{began to}} search for <b>an</b> <b>owner</b> for the team, which the league decided would be an expansion franchise March 23, 1998. A litany of potential owners lined up, including Kosar and a group backed partly by HBO founder Charles Dolan, comedian Bill Cosby and former Miami coach Don Shula. The ultimate winner was Al Lerner, the Baltimore man who had helped Modell in 1986 by buying a small stake in the Browns. A seven-member NFL expansion committee awarded the team to Lerner for $530 million in September 1998. Lerner, then 65 years old, had a majority share, while Carmen Policy, who helped build the 49ers dynasty of the 1980s, owned 10% of the team and was to run football operations.|$|E

5|$|During the {{transition}} from MS-DOS to Windows, the success of Microsoft's product Microsoft Office allowed the company to gain ground on application-software competitors, such as WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3. Novell, <b>an</b> <b>owner</b> of WordPerfect for a time, alleged that Microsoft used its inside knowledge of the DOS and Windows kernels and of undocumented Application Programming Interface features to make Office perform better than its competitors. Eventually, Microsoft Office became the dominant business suite, with a market share far exceeding that of its competitors. In March 1992, Microsoft released Windows 3.1 along with its first promotional campaign on TV; the software sold over three million copies in its first two months on the market. In October, Windows for Workgroups 3.1 was released with integrated networking abilities such as peer-to-peer file and printing sharing.
