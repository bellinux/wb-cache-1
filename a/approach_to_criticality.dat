The potential disruption in supply of critical materials could endanger such {{a transition to}} low-carbon infrastructure and, by extension, compromise energy security more broadly because low carbon technologies are reliant on these materials {{in a way that}} fossil-fuelled energy infrastructure is not. Criticality is currently defined as the combination of the potential for supply disruption and the exposure of a system of interest to that disruption.

These properties have been previously obtained through the saddle-point approximation in a coarse-grained partition function. We examine both static and dynamical aspects of a single large cluster and indicate that these properties fall outside the canonical Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) scheme. Specifically: 1) The faster than exponential growth with cluster size of the space-integrated order parameter suggests nonextensivity of the BG entropy but extensivity of a q-entropy expression. 2) The finding that the time evolution of the order parameter is described by the dynamics of an intermittent nonlinear map implies an atypical sensitivity to initial conditions compatible with q-statistics and displays an 'aging' scaling property. 3) Both, the <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>criticality</b> and the infinite-size cluster limit at criticality manifest through a crossover from canonical to q-statistics and we discuss the nonuniform convergence associated to these features.

The widely known vertical bar T-T-c vertical bar(1 -alpha) singularity of epsilon along the critical isopleth in the one-phase region is found to provide information on the effect of electric fields on the liquid-liquid critical temperature: from experimental data it is inferred that T-c usually decreases as the magnitude of the electric field is enhanced.
