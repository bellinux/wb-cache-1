25|$|The {{replacement}} of ground-based BTDF {{systems in the}} aviation role was due primarily to two factors. One was the move to ever-shorter wavelengths, which so shortened the required antennae that RDF could be carried out on a small aircraft receiver a few centimetres in length. Rotating loops were practical at these frequencies, and most aircraft used one. The second advance was {{the introduction of the}} automatic direction finder (ADF), which completely automated the RDF procedure. Once an ADF system was tuned to a station, either an <b>airway</b> <b>beacon</b> or an AM radio station, they continually moved a pointer to indicate the relative bearing with no further operator involvement.|$|E
25|$|Tyler {{is one of}} two pilots {{that started}} service with the Pacific Air Transport in 1926 flying along the west coast between Canada and Mexico. He is {{credited}} with flying the last leg, from Portland to Seattle, Washington, of a historic five-leg trip between Los Angeles, California, and Seattle, establishing the flight of the Pacific Coast Airways. Landing his biplane at Gorst Field, he handed over the first sack of mail on this new commercial route to Postmaster C. M. Perkins on 15 September 1926. To prepare the route for night flying Tyler and fellow pilot Arthur Starbuck, the other original pilot staff of PAT, drove an old Ford up and down the San Joaquin Valley setting up <b>airway</b> <b>beacon</b> lights with a pick and shovel. By 1928 the PAT had become a unit of Boeing Systems and Tyler continued flying the mail as well as passengers on this new route he had helped to establish.|$|E

50|$|The Holman Field Administration Building is a Kasota {{limestone}} building {{designed by}} Clarence Wigington and built in 1939 by WPA employees. It {{serves as the}} control building for the St. Paul Downtown Airport in Saint Paul in the U.S. state of Minnesota. The airport was named for Charles W.

5000|$|While <b>airway</b> <b>beacons</b> {{assisted}} aerial navigation {{on specific}} routes, most pilots {{at that time}} depended on dead reckoning, generally using automobile road maps (such as those from oil companies or commercial mapmakers), railroad tracks and landmarks to find their way. Jeppesen purchased a ten-cent notebook and started writing down detailed notes about his routes. He even climbed hills to determine their height and collected telephone numbers of farmers willing to provide weather reports. Word got around about his [...] "Little Black Book", and soon he was giving copies to his fellow pilots. As demand picked up, in 1934, he founded Jeppesen & Co. {{in the basement of}} his Salt Lake City home to sell his information for $10 a copy.|$|R

50|$|Beacon Field Airport was {{an airport}} {{located in the}} Groveton area of Fairfax County, Virginia, from the 1920s until its closure in 1959. One of the nation's {{earliest}} private airports, {{and particularly in the}} Washington DC Metropolitan Area, it received its name because it was the location of an <b>airway</b> <b>beacon</b> used to guide early airmail pilots. It later became a popular training site, complete with FBO, for pilots learning to fly after World War II on the G.I. Bill.|$|E
2500|$|As {{safety and}} {{capability}} grew, daytime-only operations {{gave way to}} flying at night, assisted by <b>airway</b> <b>beacons</b> and lighted emergency landing fields. Regular transcontinental air mail delivery began in 1924. In 1925, to encourage commercial aviation, the Kelly Act (also known as the Air Mail Act of 1925) authorized the Post Office Department to contract with private airlines for feeder routes into the main transcontinental system. The first commercial air mail flight was on the [...] route CAM (Contract Air Mail) No. 5 from Pasco, Washington, to Elko, Nevada, on April 6, 1926. By 1927 the transition had been completed to entirely commercial transport of mail, and by 1929 45 airlines were involved in mail delivery at a cost per mile of $1.10. Most were small, under-capitalized companies flying short routes and old equipment.|$|R
50|$|Apparently {{at least}} 47 of these {{machines}} were made (serial numbers run from 101 to 147). Six were installed at NASA and played {{important roles in}} Gemini and the Apollo missions. In the Hollywood film Apollo 13, when the screens come to life after the onboard computer has been reactivated, those screens would have been responding to a Univac 490. The U490 had complete control of {{most or all of}} the data readout screens in Houston Mission Control. The USAF had two installed, as did Lockheed. Airlines using the 490 Real-Time system included Eastern and Northwest Orient - principally airline reservations systems at Eastern Air Lines (1963) and British European <b>Airways</b> (<b>BEACON</b> - 1964). Other commercial installations of the 490 Real-Time included two at Westinghouse, and one each at Alcoa, US Steel, Bethlehem Steel and General Motors.|$|R
5000|$|On {{some older}} marker beacon receivers, {{instead of the}} [...] "O", [...] "M" [...] and [...] "I" [...] {{indicators}} (outer, middle, inner), the indicators are labeled [...] "A" [...] (or FM/Z), [...] "O" [...] and [...] "M" [...] (airway or Fan and Z marker, outer, middle). The airway marker was used to indicate reporting points along the centerline of now obsolete [...] "Red" [...] airways; this was sometimes a [...] "fan" [...] marker, whose radiated pattern was elongated at right angles across the airway course so an aircraft slightly off course would still receive it. A [...] "Z" [...] marker was sometimes located at low/medium frequency range sites to accurately denote station passage.

50|$|To {{fulfill its}} new {{aviation}} responsibilities, the Department of Commerce created an Aeronautics Branch. The first {{head of this}} organization was William P. MacCracken, Jr., whose approach to regulation included consultation and cooperation with industry. A major challenge facing MacCracken was to enlarge and improve the nation's air navigation system. The Aeronautics Branch took over the Post Office's task of building <b>airway</b> light <b>beacons,</b> and in 1928 introduced a new navigation aid known as the low frequency radio range. The branch also built additional airway communications stations {{as part of its}} effort to encourage broader use of aeronautical radio and to combat problems of adverse weather.|$|R
5000|$|Twenty four inch {{diameter}} rotating beacons were {{mounted on}} 53 ft high towers, and spaced ten miles apart. The spacing was closer in the mountains, and farther {{apart in the}} plains.

Approximately 1,500 airway beacons were constructed to guide pilots from city to city, covering 18000 mi. Most of the beacons are gone, but the State of Montana continues to maintain several as navigation aids in mountainous terrain. One beacon is preserved for historical purposes in Saint Paul, Minnesota at the Indian Mounds Park on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River. Recently, the beacon at Grants, New Mexico was restored for historic preservation, using original items found at other nearby sites.|$|E
50|$|Central Florida {{experienced}} {{a small but}} significant tornado outbreak on January 28. The most destructive of the four tornadoes on this day struck the Kissimmee and Orlando areas. An F2 tornado affected Campbell and the Idora Park section of Kissimmee, causing significant damage to about 300 homes, with seven injuries. Another F2 tornado struck the southwestern side of Orlando, where it removed the roof and wrecked several units of a multi-story apartment complex. The tornado damaged almost 230 homes and businesses, along with numerous vehicles, leaving hundreds of residents homeless and 16 (possibly 25) injured. An F1 tornado damaged mobile homes near Dade City, injuring one person, and an F2 tornado snapped an <b>airway</b> <b>beacon</b> at the Titusville-Cocoa Airport, where it also damaged an airport terminal.
