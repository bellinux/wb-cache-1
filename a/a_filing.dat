5|$|In Spoke City, Thomas Prescott accepts an {{apparently}} innocent hitch-hiker into his car. The stranger's true intentions are revealed when he attaches a metal bracelet to Prescott's wrist, warning {{him that it}} contains a powerful explosive charge that is due to detonate in 30 minutes; the key to unlock it will be found {{in his office at}} the Hudson Building. Speeding to his workplace with the police in pursuit, Prescott removes the bracelet and leaves it in <b>a</b> <b>filing</b> cabinet. The device explodes as he is returning to the ground floor in a lift: the top levels of the Hudson Building are incinerated, and Prescott is plunged {{to the bottom of the}} lift shaft, ten storeys underground.|$|E

Both Samsung and Apple were responding to a court order that instructed the completion of such a meeting before a new trial begins in March 2014. One of three Samsung chiefs met with Cook, but the filing did not reveal the name of the representative.|$|E
5|$|Among other {{inhabitants}} of London are 10,000 red foxes, {{so that there}} are now 16 foxes for every square mile (2.6 square kilometres) of London. These urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards. Foxes have even sneaked into the Houses of Parliament, where one was found asleep on <b>a</b> <b>filing</b> cabinet. Another broke into the grounds of Buckingham Palace, reportedly killing some of Queen ElizabethII's prized pink flamingos. Generally, however, foxes and city folk appear to get along. A survey in 2001 by the London-based Mammal Society found that 80 percent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around. This sample cannot be taken to represent Londoners as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre in San Jose, California, was {{the first}} {{location}} to open on May 17, 1977. The concept was authored by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, credited with bringing video games such as Pong to the mainstream. The Pizza Time Theatre {{was the first}} family restaurant to integrate food, animated entertainment, and an indoor arcade. Following <b>a</b> <b>filing</b> for bankruptcy, the chain was acquired by competitor Showbiz Pizza Place in 1984, forming Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc. In 1990, the company began unifying the two brands {{with the goal of}} renaming every location to Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza. They redesigned the logo in 1994, dropping Pizza from each store's name. In 1998, Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc. became CEC Entertainment, Inc. As of 2017, 523 Chuck E. Cheese stores are open.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most state}} chief {{executives}} in the United States, the Governor is elected by the citizens of Maryland to serve a four-year term. Under the Constitution of Maryland, the Governor can run any number of times, {{but not more than}} twice in a row. This makes it possible for a two-term governor to run for the office again after remaining out of office for at least one term. An eligible candidate for Governor must be at least 30 years old, and also a resident of and a registered voter in Maryland for the five years preceding the election. If a candidate meets this minimum requirement, he or she must file his or her candidacy with the Maryland State Board of Elections, pay <b>a</b> <b>filing</b> fee, file a financial disclosure, and create a legal campaign financial body. The Governor, like all statewide officials in Maryland, is elected in the even-numbered years in which the election for President of the United States does not occur.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass deduces that {{an alien}} {{life-form}} {{which comes from}} one of the moons of Saturn, which lives on ammonia, hydrogen and methane, but to which oxygen is a deadly poison, travels to earth in the meteorites, and in the few seconds they spend out of their shells before dying they possess human minds, and transmit knowledge to each other in a collective consciousness. From this, they assume that it was the population of Winnderden Flats itself who demolished the village and built the plant. Quatermass decides that they can use the remaining Quatermass II rocket like a nuclear bomb and destroy the asteroid, much to Leo's protest at the rocket being unsafe to fly. Fowler tries to steal information about the other plants from the ministry, but is overcome and possessed by a makeshift meteorite hidden inside <b>a</b> <b>filing</b> cabinet.|$|E

50|$|Helix angle — Helix {{angle is}} an angle between {{the cutting edge}} and the long access of <b>a</b> <b>file.</b> Helix angle plays an {{important}} role in debris collection and it also determines the direction of rotation.

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>filing</b> cabinet is a {{piece of}} office {{furniture}} usually used to store paper documents in file folders. In the most simple sense, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. A vertical file cabinet has drawers that extend from the short side (typically 15inches) of the cabinet. The vertical filing cabinet was invented by Edwin G. Seibels in 1898, thus revolutionizing efficient record-keeping and archiving by creating space for offices, schools, and businesses.|$|E

The company had been encountering difficulties in meeting interest payments on its outstanding debt and Young's stock, which had been trading for a few cents per share, would ultimately be delisted from NASDAQ in January 2009, after failing to meet the minimum standards for being on the exchange. One month later on February 13, Young made <b>a</b> <b>filing</b> to place the company under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

3000|$|The {{advantages}} of the indirect method are contrary to the direct method. The indirect method {{does not depend on}} the implementation of <b>a</b> <b>file</b> system. The provision of the XIP feature of <b>a</b> <b>file</b> system requires the implementation of get_xip_mem (...) interface. This interface converts <b>a</b> <b>file</b> offset to its virtual address in the kernel and its page frame number. By using this interface, it is possible to access all of the blocks of <b>a</b> <b>file</b> used for main memory, and its initialization can be done independently from the internal implementation of <b>a</b> <b>file</b> system. The linked list of the free blocks also makes the allocation cost independent from the internal implementation. Moreover, since the blocks used for main memory are allocated for <b>a</b> <b>file,</b> they do not cause the inconsistency of <b>a</b> <b>file</b> system when <b>a</b> system crashes. The disadvantage is that the blocks of <b>a</b> <b>file</b> used for main memory are preallocated; thus, their use is fixed for main memory. It is desirable to adjust the size of the preallocated file. While it is easy to extend the file size as more blocks need to be allocated for main memory, more work is necessary to shrink it.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{techniques}} to recover useful information from disk drives {{that are used}} to store user data. The main idea is to use a logging mechanism to record the modifications to each disk block, and then employ fast algorithms to reconstruct the contents of <b>a</b> <b>file</b> (or <b>a</b> directory) as it existed sometime in the past. Such a consistent snapshot of <b>a</b> <b>file</b> may be used to determine whether <b>a</b> given <b>file</b> ever existed on disk, to undelete <b>a</b> <b>file</b> that was deleted long ago, or to obtain a timeline of activities on <b>a</b> <b>file.</b> This {{can also be used to}} validate that <b>a</b> <b>file</b> with given contents existed at some time in the past or to refute a claim that <b>a</b> <b>file</b> existed in <b>a</b> time interval. Information gathered using these consistent snapshots can be used as valuable digital evidence...|$|R

25|$|In most cases, a {{domestic}} partnership must be dissolved through filing a court action identical to an action for dissolution of marriage. In limited circumstances, however, <b>a</b> <b>filing</b> with the Secretary of State may suffice. This procedure is available when the domestic partnership {{has not been}} in force {{for more than five}} years. The couple must also meet many other requirements that the dissolution be both simple and uncontested: no children (or current pregnancy) within the relationship, no real estate (including certain leases), and little joint property or debt. The parties must also review materials prepared by the Secretary of State, execute an agreement dividing assets and liability, and waive claims to domestic partner support. Where all the requirements are met, the partnership will terminate six months after the filing, unless either party revokes consent.|$|E
25|$|In July 1999 the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) {{and several}} U.S. federal {{government}} agencies selected a route for the connecting ramps from the northbound and southbound portions of Interstate 95 to the Terminal A-West complex, then under development; the agency {{tried to avoid}} the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum. However K/B Fund II, {{the owner of the}} International Plaza complex, formerly the Scott Paper headquarters Scott Plaza, objected to the proposed routing. K/B Fund II argued that the proposed routing would interfere with the International Plaza development. It entered <b>a</b> <b>filing</b> in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to challenge the proposed routing. In 2000 the airport attempted to acquire the complex for $90 million but Tinicum Township commissioners stopped the deal from going forward, citing concerns of a loss of tax revenue for the township and the Interboro School District, which serves Tinicum, as well as noise pollution concerns.|$|E
25|$|In March 2000 Altmann filed a {{civil claim}} against the Austrian {{government}} {{for the return of}} the paintings. She was informed that the cost of filing (consisting of 1.2% of the amount in question, plus <b>a</b> <b>filing</b> fee), would have meant a fee of €1.75 million. To avoid the prohibitively high costs, Altmann and Schoenberg sued the Austrian government and the Galerie Belvedere in the US courts. The Austrian government filed for dismissal, based on arguments around the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (1976). The Act granted immunity to sovereign nations except under certain conditions. Schoenberg showed that three of the conditions pertinent to the case were that Altmann's property had been taken in violation of international law; the property was owned by the state in question, or one of its agencies; and that the property had been used on a commercial basis in the US. Over four years of litigation followed as to whether the case could be brought against a sovereign state before it was brought before the Supreme Court in Republic of Austria v. Altmann. In June 2004 the Supreme Court determined that the paintings had been stolen and that Austria was not immune from a claim from Altmann; the court made no comment on the current ownership of the paintings.|$|E
3000|$|The third {{issue is}} the {{identification}} of the pages allocated from <b>a</b> <b>file</b> system. The pages allocated from DRAM need to be returned to the DRAM memory allocator, and those from <b>a</b> <b>file</b> system need to be returned to it. When free_hot_cold_page (...) is called to free pages, however, there is no distinction between those from DRAM and <b>a</b> <b>file</b> system. free_hot_cold_page (...) has to identity where they are allocated from; thus, there must be a means to realize it. Therefore, a new attribute NVmemory is added to identify the pages allocated from <b>a</b> <b>file</b> system. When the pages with NVmemory attribute are freed, they are returned to <b>a</b> <b>file</b> system.|$|R
