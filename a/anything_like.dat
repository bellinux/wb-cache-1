5|$|Although {{she had not}} {{suffered}} <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> {{the damage}} she had inflicted, Virginia was not completely unscathed. Shots from Cumberland, Congress, and Union troops ashore had riddled her smokestack, reducing her already low speed. Two of her guns were disabled and several armor plates had been loosened. Two of her crew were killed, and more were wounded. One of the wounded was Captain Buchanan, whose left thigh was pierced by a rifle shot.|$|E
5|$|Etruscan {{architecture}} {{was created}} between about 700 BC and 200 BC, when the expanding civilization of ancient Rome finally absorbed Etruscan civilization. The Etruscans were considerable builders in stone, wood {{and other materials}} of temples, houses, tombs and city walls, as well as bridges and roads. The only structures remaining in quantity in <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> their original condition are tombs and walls, but through archaeology and other sources {{we have a good}} deal of information on what once existed.|$|E

5|$|Most {{importantly}} the operas themselves {{are now beginning}} to be revived and recorded, although despite the efforts of such champions as Dame Joan Sutherland, who took part in performances of, and recorded, Les Huguenots, they have yet to achieve <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> the huge popular following they attracted during their creator's lifetime. Recordings are now available of all the operas from Il crociato onwards, for many of the earlier Italian operas, and for other pieces including his songs and the incidental music for Struensee.|$|E
5|$|This led to {{proposals}} {{for a new}} radar dedicated solely to the early warning role, determining only which MAR or SCD would ultimately {{have to deal with}} the threat. Used primarily in the first minutes of the attack, and not responsible for the engagements, the system could be considered disposable and did not need <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> the sophistication or hardening of the MAR. This led to the Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR), which would operate cheaper electronics at VHF frequencies.|$|E
5|$|After {{the recent}} Polish Campaign, the German Army staff {{analysis}} had been rigorous in its analysis of that battle. The Army's General Staff had assessed {{the problems of}} leadership, tactics, command and control to improve effectiveness. It appears that Schumacher's fighter units did not {{do the same and}} were too busy congratulating themselves on their success. There is little evidence that the Luftwaffe took <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> the Army's approach in Poland, following their own victory at Heligoland Bight. The historian for the Luftwaffes General Staff noted it was only exploited for propaganda, despite the operational problems and warnings the battle had flagged for attacker and defender.|$|E

5|$|The {{most radical}} {{feature of the}} {{original}} car was its use of flat plate heat exchangers mounted flush {{to the surface of}} the bodywork in place of conventional water radiators. The absence of standard radiators allowed Murray to compensate somewhat for the large engine and fuel tanks and produce a relatively light design with a low frontal cross section (important to reduce drag). In practice the heat exchangers did not provide <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> enough cooling capacity, one of South African Murray’s rare design failures, and were replaced by more standard radiators in the nose of the car, similar to that of the BT45, compromising its aerodynamic efficiency. In addition to the question of drag the nose-mounted radiators moved weight towards the front of the car.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

No British company could offer <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it, and when Fairey imported 50 of the type (renaming them as the Fairey Felix) the Air Ministry had enough and ordered Napier and Rolls-Royce to start work on cast-block engines of their own.|$|E
25|$|In the 1987 {{season he}} {{appeared}} eight times in first-class cricket, his most {{in a single}} season, but {{the only time he}} was <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> a regular was in the one-day form of the game the following summer, when he made 20 List A appearances. However, in those games he took only 14 wickets and failed entirely with the bat, compiling just 81 runs in his 11 innings.|$|E

25|$|He {{made his}} debut against Glamorgan in June 1934, taking three wickets in the match {{including}} that of Arnold Dyson in both innings. A fortnight later against Hampshire he claimed a career-best 7-51, {{but he was never}} to achieve <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that success again, taking more than one wicket in only two more games. He did, however, manage his modest best score with the bat (28) against Lancashire in July.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, a guest {{was stabbed}} {{critically}} by another guest.

25|$|Early on, it was {{believed}} that the V-2 employed some form of radio guidance, a belief that persisted in spite of several rockets being examined without discovering <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> a radio receiver. This led to efforts to jam this non-existent guidance system as early as September 1944, using both ground and air-based jammers flying over the UK. In October a group had been sent to jam the missiles during launch. By December it was clear these systems were having no obvious effect, and jamming efforts ended.|$|E

25|$|However, illness {{severely}} affected Russell's {{performance in}} 1923: {{only after a}} rest of two weeks in late June did he recover <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> his best form, and his average fell from 52 to 29.71. This placed him out of calculations for representative honours, especially as Sutcliffe {{established himself as a}} representative player that year. Nonetheless, in 1925 Russell hit seven centuries and scored 2,080 runs, whilst in 1928 he scored 131 and 104 against Lancashire, who were County Champions for the third successive year that season.|$|E
25|$|Production of such {{materials}} at industrial scale {{had to be}} solved for nuclear power generation and weapons production to be accomplished.
