40|$|Abstract: Architecture of a {{test-bed}} {{is suggested}} that has capabilities {{for the development of}} <b>agents</b> <b>and</b> multi-agent systems, and also serves for semi-automatic testing, assessment and verification of selected properties of those <b>agents</b> <b>and</b> systems. The test-bed is essentially based on models of interactive computations. New features in the test-bed are caused by an attempt explicitly to describe and formally analyse timing characteristics of <b>agents</b> <b>and</b> their interactions. Time properties of <b>agents</b> <b>and</b> their interactions have top importance in guaranteeing proper functioning of many monitoring and control applications. Copyright Â© 2002 IFA...|$|R

Krusty is encouraged by them into making a comeback, and they inform him that they met an agent that can help him out. However, when they all go to Annie's office, Annie instantly recognizes Krusty and angrily slams the door before he {{gets a chance to}} enter. It is revealed that Annie was the one who discovered Krusty, became his first <b>agent,</b> <b>and</b> was responsible for his rise to success. They also had a romantic relationship together. However, once he achieved fame, Krusty fired Annie and replaced her with a more acclaimed <b>agent,</b> <b>and</b> as a result their relationship ended. Back in the present, he begs her to take him back as a client, and she eventually accepts.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} Bayesian method for {{distributed}} sequential localization of mobile networks composed of both cooperative <b>agents</b> <b>and</b> noncooperative objects. Our method provides a consistent combination of cooperative self-localization (CS) and distributed tracking (DT). Multiple mobile <b>agents</b> <b>and</b> objects are localized and tracked using measurements between <b>agents</b> <b>and</b> objects <b>and</b> between <b>agents.</b> For a distributed operation and low complexity, we combine particle-based belief propagation with a consensus or gossip scheme. High localization accuracy is achieved through a probabilistic information transfer between the CS and DT {{parts of the}} underlying factor graph. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in both <b>agent</b> self-localization <b>and</b> object localization performance compared to separate CS and DT, and very good scaling properties {{with respect to the}} numbers of <b>agents</b> <b>and</b> objects.

5|$|Greenlandic verbs inflect for {{agreement}} with <b>agent</b> <b>and</b> patient, for mood and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four {{are used in}} independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take transitive, intransitive or negative inflections, so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms. The inflectional system is further {{complicated by the fact}} that transitive suffixes encode both <b>agent</b> <b>and</b> patient in a single morpheme, requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of <b>agent</b> <b>and</b> patient for each of the eight transitive paradigms. As some moods do not have forms for all persons (imperative only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318.|$|E

A 50 percent sample of each population was selected to receive surveys with 34 of the 45 county <b>agents</b> <b>and</b> 61 of the 70 vocational agriculture teachers providing valid responses. The results were tested for frequency and then cross tabulated with the mean scores of the questions. T-tests were performed to determine if there was significance in the responses made by county <b>agents</b> <b>and</b> the vocational agriculture teachers. The results indicated that significance existed in the responses relating to personal factors and activities. Mean scores indicated that both groups, county <b>agents</b> <b>and</b> vocational agriculture teachers, responded negatively to the questions in this area. Mean scores also indicated the vocational agriculture teachers perceived the questions to have a more negative effect than did the county extension agents...|$|R
