5|$|Bulgaria has {{a typical}} civil law legal system. The {{judiciary}} is {{overseen by the}} Ministry of Justice. The Supreme Administrative Court <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> of Cassation are the highest courts of appeal and oversee the application of laws in subordinate courts. The Supreme Judicial Council manages the system and appoints judges. Bulgaria's judiciary, along with other institutions, remains one of Europe's most corrupt and inefficient.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, {{attempts}} {{to suppress the}} statements given by J. D. B. {{because he was not}} given a Miranda warning were denied on the grounds that J. D. B. was not in police custody.

5|$|The Santoskys appealed, and the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court {{affirmed the}} ruling of the Family Court.

5|$|A note {{published}} in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology supported {{the decision on}} procedural grounds, noting that using age in the custody analysis was not a precedent established by the Supreme Court.

5|$|Cameroon's {{legal system}} is {{largely based on}} French civil law with common law influences. Although {{nominally}} independent, the judiciary falls {{under the authority of}} the executive's Ministry of Justice. The president appoints judges at all levels. The judiciary is officially divided into tribunals, the court of appeal, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>court.</b> The National Assembly elects the members of a nine-member High Court of Justice that judges high-ranking members of government in the event they are charged with high treason or harming national security.|$|E
5|$|Chinese-American cook Wong Kim Ark, who {{was born}} in San Francisco in 1873, had been denied {{re-entry}} to the United States after a trip abroad, under a law restricting Chinese immigration and prohibiting immigrants from China (the Great Qing) from becoming naturalized U.S. citizens. He challenged the government's refusal to recognize his citizenship, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> ruled in his favor, holding that the citizenship language in the Fourteenth Amendment encompassed the circumstances of his birth and could not be limited in its effect by an act of Congress.|$|E

5|$|The main {{national}} courts are the Constitutional Court, which oversees {{violations of the}} Constitution, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court,</b> which is the highest court of appeal. In addition, there are also County, Municipal, Misdemeanor, Commercial, and Administrative courts. Cases falling within judicial jurisdiction are {{in the first instance}} decided by a single professional judge, while appeals are deliberated in mixed tribunals of professional judges. Lay magistrates also participate in trials. State's Attorney Office is the judicial body constituted of public prosecutors that is empowered to instigate prosecution of perpetrators of offences.|$|E
5|$|Although Roosevelt, {{most of his}} aides, Johnson, and the NRA staff {{felt the}} Act would survive a court test, the U.S. Department of Justice had on March 25, 1935, {{declined}} to appeal an appellate court ruling overturning the lumber industry code {{on the grounds that}} the case was not a good test of the NIRA's constitutionality. The Justice Department's action worried many in the administration. But on April 1, 1935 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the NIRA in the Schechter case. Although Donald Richberg and others felt the government's case in Schechter was not a strong one, the Schechters were determined to appeal their conviction. So the government appealed first, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> heard oral argument on May 2 and 3.|$|E
5|$|As World War II neared, Minton took a {{cautious}} position on United States involvement. When the Soviet Union invaded Finland, Minton voted against granting a loan to Finland {{to help finance}} its defense efforts. He also opposed selling munitions and weapons to the Allies or the Axis powers. He advocated and supported expanding the American military and believed that American entry into the war was inevitable, but should be delayed as long as possible. He {{voted in favor of}} the Smith Act, which made it a crime to advocate the overthrow of the government, a law specifically targeted at communists and fascists in the United States. In his final year in office, there was considerable speculation in the press that Minton would be named to higher office by Roosevelt, including cabinet positions <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court,</b> but neither happened.|$|E

5|$|As a first-level {{administrative}} division, the National Capital Territory of Delhi {{has its own}} Legislative Assembly, Lieutenant Governor, {{council of}} ministers and Chief Minister. Members of the legislative assembly are directly elected from territorial constituencies in the NCT. The legislative assembly was abolished in 1956, after which direct federal control was implemented until it was re-established in 1993. The Municipal corporation handles civic. administration for the city {{as part of the}} Panchayati Raj Act. The Government of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi jointly administer New Delhi, where both bodies are located. The Parliament of India, the Rashtrapati Bhavan (Presidential Palace), Cabinet Secretariat <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> of India are located in the municipal district of New Delhi.

5|$|In 1927, the California {{legislature}} {{passed a}} statute authorizing the California Attorney General to bring claims {{on behalf of}} the tribes in the Court of Claims. The next year, Congress passed a statute granting that court jurisdiction for such claims. California Attorney General Earl Warren (future Chief Justice) finally argued the case in 1941. The court found liability but indicated it would not award pre-judgment interest, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> declined to grant certiorari. Warren negotiated a $5M settlement. After the passage of the Indian Claims Commission Act, the same group of tribes struggled to bring a single action for recovery under the broader claims allowed under the ICCA, which settled for $29M.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Daniel (1821), Chief Justice John Marshall {{recounted the}} history of tie-breaking methods on the circuit courts. If one judge or justice {{disagreed}} with the other two, the majority prevailed. If only one Supreme Court justice could attend, and a division arose between the district judge <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> justice, the practiceas required by the Judiciary Act of 1793was to hold the case over until the next term. If a one-to-one division persisted with a different circuit riding justice, {{the opinion of the}} previous circuit rider broke the tie. After 1802, in cases where both judges sat, though, one-to-one divisions {{were less likely to be}} resolved by continuing the case until the next term because the circuit-riding justice would be the same (barring a change in membership on the Court).|$|E

When the court moved to Danville in 1785, it ordered that two men {{determine}} {{the cost of}} constructing the buildings it needed to function, including a courthouse and jail. The report called for assessments {{to be made on}} the district's four counties for the construction of the buildings; Jefferson County was assessed £431, Nelson County £49, Fayette County £86, and Lincoln County £122. Isaac Hite was chosen to construct the buildings, which were finished in 1785. The jail was built {{in the center of the}} square, and the courthouse was situated between the jail and Walnut Street.|$|E
5|$|Within {{months of}} his {{admission}} to the bar, Benjamin argued his first case before the Supreme Court of Louisiana and won. Still, clients were slow to come in his first years in practice, and he had enough free time to compile and publish, with Thomas Slidell, the Digest of the Reported Decisions of the Superior Court of the Late Territory of Orleans <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> of the State of Louisiana in 1834, which required the analysis of 6,000 cases. The book was an immediate success and helped launch Benjamin's career. When Slidell published a revised edition in 1840, he did so alone, as Benjamin was too busy trying cases {{to allow him to}} participate.|$|E
