5|$|Goldman {{found it}} {{difficult}} to <b>acclimate</b> to the German leftist community in Berlin. Communists despised her outspokenness about Soviet repression; liberals derided her radicalism. While Berkman remained in Berlin helping Russian exiles, Goldman moved to London in September 1924. Upon her arrival, the novelist Rebecca West arranged a reception dinner for her, attended by philosopher Bertrand Russell, novelist H. G. Wells, and more than 200 other guests. When she spoke of her dissatisfaction with the Soviet government, the audience was shocked. Some left the gathering; others berated her for prematurely criticizing the Communist experiment. Later, in a letter, Russell declined to support her efforts at systemic change in the Soviet Union and ridiculed her anarchist idealism.|$|E
5|$|Peregrine falcon {{recovery}} teams breed {{the species}} in captivity. The chicks are usually fed through a chute {{or with a}} hand puppet mimicking a peregrine's head, so they cannot see to imprint on the human trainers. Then, when they are old enough, the rearing box is opened, allowing the bird to train its wings. As the fledgling gets stronger, feeding is reduced, forcing the bird to learn to hunt. This procedure is called hacking back to the wild. To release a captive-bred falcon, the bird is placed in a special cage {{at the top of}} a tower or cliff ledge for some days or so, allowing it to <b>acclimate</b> itself to its future environment.|$|E
40|$|Freeze-fracture {{electron}} microscopy reveals a decreased particle concentration {{on the inner}} fracture face of <b>acclimated</b> thylakoids, suggestive of some alteration(s) in the hydrophobic region. Sonic oscillation causes {{a reversal of the}} altered particle concentration in <b>acclimated</b> thylakoids and suggests that increases in unsaturation of fatty acids can, at most, account for only part of the altered particle concentration. The particles on the inner fracture face of <b>acclimated</b> thylakoids are of one size group (± 140 Å) as compared to two size groups (± 100 Å and ± 165 Å) for nonacclimated thylakoids. The paracrystalline array might be associated with the <b>acclimated</b> state of thylakoids. Nonacclimated thylakoids require 50 mm sucrose for maximum protection of light-dependent proton uptake, while <b>acclimated</b> thylakoids require 25 mm sucrose, and the protection afforded <b>acclimated</b> thylakoids during a freeze-thaw cycle is greater. Sucrose is required for alterations in <b>acclimated</b> thylakoids to be manifested. Apparently increased hardiness is not only associated with changes in cellular environment but also alterations in membranes...|$|R
40|$|The {{significant}} influence of thermal acclimation on physiological and behavioral performance {{has been documented}} in many ectothermic animals, but such studies are still limited in turtle species. We <b>acclimated</b> hatchling soft-shelled turtles Pelodiscus sinensis under three thermal conditions (10, 20 and 30 °C) for 4 weeks, and then measured selected body temperature (Tsel), critical thermal minimum (CTMin) and maximum (CTMax), and locomotor performance at different body temperatures. Thermal acclimation significantly affected thermal preference and resistance of P. sinensis hatchlings. Hatchling turtles <b>acclimated</b> to 10 °C selected relatively lower body temperatures and were less resistant to high temperatures than those <b>acclimated</b> to 20 °C and 30 °C. The turtles’ resistance to low temperatures increased with a decreasing acclimation temperature. The thermal resistance range (i. e. the difference between CTMax and CTMin, TRR) was widest in turtles <b>acclimated</b> to 20 °C, and narrowest in those <b>acclimated</b> to 10 °C. The locomotor performance of turtles was affected by both body temperature and acclimation temperature. Hatchling turtles <b>acclimated</b> to relatively higher temperatures swam faster than did those <b>acclimated</b> to lower temperatures. Accordingly, hatchling turtles <b>acclimated</b> to a particular temperature may not enhance the performance at that temperature. Instead, hatchlings <b>acclimated</b> to relatively warm temperatures have a better performance, supporting the “hotter is better” hypothesis [Current Zoology 59 (6) : 718 – 724, 2013]...|$|R

5|$|Pong was {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Atari. After producing Computer Space, Bushnell decided to form a company to produce more games by licensing ideas to other companies. The first contract was with Bally Manufacturing Corporation for a driving game. Soon after the founding, Bushnell hired Allan Alcorn because of his experience with electrical engineering and computer science; Bushnell and Dabney also had previously worked with him at Ampex. Prior to working at Atari, Alcorn had no experience with video games. To <b>acclimate</b> Alcorn to creating games, Bushnell gave him a project secretly {{meant to be a}} warm-up exercise. Bushnell told Alcorn that he had a contract with General Electric for a product, and asked Alcorn to create a simple game with one moving spot, two paddles, and digits for score keeping. In 2011, Bushnell stated that the game was inspired by previous versions of electronic tennis he had played before; Bushnell played a version on a PDP-1 computer in 1964 while attending college. However, Alcorn has claimed it was in direct response to Bushnell's viewing of the Magnavox Odyssey's Tennis game. In May 1972, Bushnell had visited the Magnavox Profit Caravan in Burlingame, California where he played the Magnavox Odyssey demonstration, specifically the table tennis game. Though he thought the game lacked quality, seeing it prompted Bushnell to assign the project to Alcorn.|$|E

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that ATP levels and energy charge determine the resistance of maize (Zea mays) root tips to anoxia. We focused on root tips of whole maize seedlings that had been <b>acclimated</b> to low O 2 by exposure to an atmosphere of 3 % (v/v) O 2 in N 2. <b>Acclimated</b> anoxic root tips characteristically have higher ATP levels and energy charge and survive longer under anoxia than nonacclimated tips. We poisoned intact, <b>acclimated</b> root tips with either fluoride or mannose, causing decreases in ATP and energy charge to values similar to or, in most cases, below those found in nonacclimated anoxic tips. With {{the exception of the}} highest fluoride concentration used, the poisoned, <b>acclimated</b> tips remained much more tolerant of anoxia than nonacclimated root tips. We conclude that high ATP and energy charge are not components critical for the survival of <b>acclimated</b> root tips during anoxia. The reduced nucleotide status in poisoned, <b>acclimated</b> root tips had little effect on cytoplasmic pH regulation during anoxia. This result indicates that in anoxic, <b>acclimated</b> root tips either cytoplasmic pH regulation is not dominated by ATP-dependent processes or these processes can continue in vivo largely independently of any changes in ATP levels in the physiological range.

40|$|When cooled at rapid {{rates to}} {{temperatures}} between − 10 and − 30 °C, {{the incidence of}} intracellular ice formation was less in protoplasts enzymically isolated from cold <b>acclimated</b> leaves of rye (Secale cereale L. cv Puma) than that observed in protoplasts isolated from nonacclimated leaves. The extent of supercooling of the intracellular solution at any given temperature increased in both nonacclimated and <b>acclimated</b> protoplasts as the rate of cooling increased. There was no unique relationship between the extent of supercooling and the incidence of intracellular ice formation in either nonacclimated or <b>acclimated</b> protoplasts. In both nonacclimated and <b>acclimated</b> protoplasts, the extent of intracellular supercooling was similar under conditions {{that resulted in the}} greatest difference in the incidence of intracellular ice formation—cooling to − 15 or − 20 °C at rates of 10 or 16 °C/minute. Further, the hydraulic conductivity determined during freeze-induced dehydration at − 5 °C was similar for both nonacclimated and <b>acclimated</b> protoplasts. A major distinction between nonacclimated and <b>acclimated</b> protoplasts was the temperature at which nucleation occurred. In nonacclimated protoplasts, nucleation occurred over a relatively narrow temperature range with a median nucleation temperature of − 15 °C, whereas in <b>acclimated</b> protoplasts, nucleation occurred over a broader temperature range with a median nucleation temperature of − 42 °C. We conclude that the decreased incidence of intracellular ice formation in <b>acclimated</b> protoplasts is attributable to an increase in the stability of the plasma membrane which precludes nucleation of the supercooled intracellular solution and is not attributable to an increase in hydraulic conductivity of the plasma membrane which purportedly precludes supercooling of the intracellular solution...|$|R
40|$|Potato (Solanum tuberosum) {{cells were}} {{gradually}} <b>acclimated</b> {{to grow at}} low water potential created by addition of increasing concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 to the nutrient medium. While growth of cells abruptly transferred into a medium containing 20 % PEG was dramatically inhibited, under the same stress intensity gradually <b>acclimated</b> cells were able to sustain active growth similarly to control unstressed cells. Gradual acclimation allowed the maintenance of normal cellular and subcellular membrane structure at an osmotic potential of - 2. 3 MPa, which caused extended membrane disruption when applied to non-acclimated control cells. Analysis of fatty acids (FAs) from control and <b>acclimated</b> cells revealed that the mol percentage composition of the major extra-plastidial phospholipids (PLs) was basically unchanged, but both phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were more saturated in <b>acclimated</b> cells. The decrease in unsaturation occurred primarily {{at the expense of}} linoleic acid (18 : 2) in the PE fraction. A significant increase in the percentage content of palmitic acid (16 : 0) of the PE fraction was also detected in <b>acclimated</b> cells. Membrane microviscosity, as determined by diphenyl-hexatriene (DPH) labelling, was higher in PEG-acclimated cells, as expected from the lower degree of unsaturation of membrane FAs found in <b>acclimated</b> cells. The steady-state transcript levels of a Δ 9 -stearoyl-acyl carrier protein-desaturase and a Δ 12 -oleoyl-desaturase gene decreased in <b>acclimated</b> cells, suggesting that the variation in the level of FA unsaturation was at least partially associated with down-regulation of the expression of these genes...|$|R

Overall, selected body temperature (Tsel) and viable temperature range (VTR) were both highest in E. brenchleyi and lowest in E. multiocellata, with E. argus in between; critical thermal minimum (CTMin) was highest in E. multiocellata and lowest in E. brenchleyi, with E. argus in between; critical thermal maximum (CTMax) was lower in E. multiocellata than in other two species. Lizards <b>acclimated</b> to 28 °C and 38 °C overall selected lower body temperatures than those <b>acclimated</b> to 33 °C; lizards <b>acclimated</b> to high temperatures were less tolerant of low temperatures, and vice versa; lizards <b>acclimated</b> to 28 °C were less tolerant of high temperatures but had a wider VTR range than those <b>acclimated</b> to 33 °C and 38 °C.

During anoxia, <b>acclimated</b> Adh 1 - root tips showed a higher rate of anaerobic respiration and ethanol production, greater concentrations of ATP and total adenylates, and a greater adenylate energy charge compared with unacclimated root tips.

Decreased levels of HSP 70 were noted in all the tissues of fish when exposed to temperatures that exceeded the optimum temperatures for HSP 70 inductions. Overall results indicated that acclimation temperature influences both temperature tolerance and induction of HSP 70 in H. brachysoma...|$|R
