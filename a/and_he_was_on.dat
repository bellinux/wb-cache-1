5|$|Punk cited {{his health}} {{as the main}} reason he left WWE, {{describing}} that in his final months in the company, {{he had been working}} through an untreated and potentially fatal MRSA infection, broken ribs, injured knees, and multiple concussions including one at the Royal Rumble, as well as having lost his appetite and ability to sleep well. Punk felt that WWE was pressuring and rushing him to wrestle before he had fully recovered. According to him, he found a lump on his back in November 2013 and it was diagnosed as a fatty deposit by Dr. Chris Amann, who refused to remove it despite Punk's requests. The week after Punk left WWE, his wife April Mendez convinced him to get the lump checked by her doctor. The doctor diagnosed it as a MRSA infection and told Punk that he could have died due to ignoring it for such a long time. Punk had the doctor evacuate the infection, describing it as the worst pain in his life, but said that once it was treated <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> stronger medication, he was able to sleep better than he had in weeks.|$|E

25|$|Wellham scored 24 and 103, thus {{becoming}} the 12th Australian batsman {{to score a}} century on Test debut. Wellham's century was criticised by some commentators for being too slow and costing Australia a chance of victory. After scoring his first 80 runs in under 90 balls, Kim Hughes sent a runner onto the field to tell Wellham to take his time as the series had already been lost and the result didn't matter. Wellham's 103 took 221 balls <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> 99 for 25 minutes.|$|E

25|$|Arizona's {{changing}} population also hurt Goldwater. The state's {{population had}} soared, {{and a huge}} portion of the electorate had not lived in the state when Goldwater was previously elected; hence, many voters were less familiar with Goldwater's actual beliefs, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the defensive {{for much of the}} campaign. Early returns on election night seemed to indicate that Schulz would win. The counting of votes continued through the night and into the next morning. At around daybreak, Goldwater learned that he had been reelected thanks to absentee ballots, which were among the last to be counted. Goldwater's surprisingly close victory in 1980 came despite Reagan's 61% landslide over Jimmy Carter in Arizona. Republicans regained control of the Senate, putting Goldwater in the most powerful position he ever had in the Senate.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the tallest}} bowlers ever to play Test cricket, Garner {{appeared}} in 58 Tests between 1977 and 1987 and took 259 wickets {{at an average}} of barely above 20, making him statistically {{one of the most effective}} bowlers of all time. However, it was in limited overs cricket that Garner put his height to use with devastating effect. In 98 matches he took 146 wickets. He had the ability to unleash a devastating yorker, as well as the ability to generate more bounce. He is one of the two players (the other being Mitchell Starc) with more than 100 ODI wickets to average under 20, while his economy rate of just over 3 runs per over, and average of less than 20 runs per wicket are also the best ever for any bowler who took more than 100 wickets. His 5 for 39 in the 1979 Cricket World Cup final against England remains the best ever performance by a bowler in a final; it included a spell of 5 wickets for 4 runs, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> a hat-trick twice.|$|E
25|$|On 14 June, General of {{artillery}} Ramirez Arellano arrived {{to the region}} and after having himself disguised as a charcoal-burner, infiltrated into the city and gave reports about the current situation of the Empire.

As soon as the rumors spread that the Emperor was victorious in Querétaro <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> his way to relieve the capital, a great feast was held in the city. Díaz saw the fiesta as an opportunity to break the stalemate while the city was distracted with their celebration. At noon, he unexpectedly attacked San Cosme and Belen, sneaking with his soldiers one by one through an aqueduct. The native Indians and the French took up the arms against the surprise attack. They charged two cannons with grapeshots and targeted both sides of the aqueduct, while six men mounted it to cut the only possible escape route. The Liberals tried to take initiative three times, all of which were repulsed and they retreated. At the end of the assault attempt several hundred Liberals were found dead in the field.|$|E

500|$|RLI patrols were {{intensified}} further {{over the}} following days, with 3 Commando being brought in to assist around Sipolilo. 13 Troop, 3 Commando, under Sergeant Phil Raath, encountered the 10 cadres at a kraal near Bakasa, north of Sipolilo, on 31 January, and killed one; the other nine fled. Later that day a patrol led by Corporal Dennis Croukamp captured Phinias Majuru, the ZIPRA Director of Operations. [...] "It was only a week later after the patrol was over that we learnt who it was we had captured," [...] Croukamp writes. [...] "It was Joshua Nkomo's Chief of Operations. The equivalent of a very senior staff officer, {{he was in the}} country trying to determine why ZIPRA was being so unsuccessful <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> his way back with recommendations, clipboard and all." [...] The remaining ZIPRA fighters scattered and escaped the area {{over the following}} week, the Rhodesian Security Forces losing track of each one. On 9 February 1970 local security force presence was reduced to police, one helicopter and one RLI Commando. A member of Gang 3 was arrested by the Portuguese in Mozambique the next day, but without further developments over the next month, Operation Birch shut down on 5 March 1970. Two more members of Gang 4 were detained by police in Mukumbura township on 21 March, and three days later the Portuguese killed one and captured another. The final account for Operation Birch, which had countered the last ZIPRA incursion for six years, was seven cadres killed, thirteen captured and two outstanding. [...] "From 1970 onward, ZAPU played no part in the terrorist war," [...] writes Lieutenant-Colonel R. E. H. Lockley. [...] "They were in a state of disarray following their decisive defeats within Rhodesia, so they took the opportunity of consolidating their position by sending their terrorists outside the country on extended courses to Russia, Cuba and North Korea. This situation with ZAPU continued until 1976. ... There were no incursions in 1970 worthy of note." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1896, Hogan {{received}} {{an offer to}} manage the Youngstown (Ohio) Puddlers, a minor league team associated with the Interstate League. [...] The Vindicator reported that the outfielder refused the offer. [...] "Hogan expects to play again with the St. Louis team in the National League", the Vindicator stated. [...] The paper went on to quote an article that supposedly appeared in the Cincinnati-based Commercial Gazette: [...] "St. Louis fans {{are opposed to the}} idea of selling Marty Hogan, the fast out-fielder, who played with the Indianapolis team last season, having been loaned by the Browns". [...] In the spring of 1896, however, Hogan attempted to extricate himself from remaining contractual obligations to the St. Louis Browns. [...] Sporting Life reported, in May 1896, that Hogan was unsuccessful in his efforts to obtain a final release from the Browns, who retained him as an [...] "extra" [...] right fielder. [...] "Marty has not been given any kind of trial by the manager of the Browns, although he stood high in batting and base running in the Western League last year", the article stated. [...] "He is in fine condition, and is anxious to play, but does not prepare to be shifted about at the will of alleged managers". [...] The paper added that Hogan had returned to St. Louis in March 1896, prepared to [...] "purchase" [...] his release, [...] "but he has been held onto until now, when he could have secured $1550 for his services in the Western League". [...] Hogan appeared especially confident of his baserunning abilities. [...] The article noted that the outfielder had [...] "offered to match himself to run 100 yards for $500 a side against any player in the National League". [...] Meanwhile, his batting evidently continued to improve. On May 24, 1896, an article in the St. Paul (Minnesota) Globe indicated Hogan performed exceptionally well at the bat during a contest between the Hoosiers and the St. Paul Saints. [...] "Marty Hogan...through an inadvertent mix-up of pugilism and baseball...tried to hammer the face off the ball, which had tantalized the other Hoosiers", the article stated, [...] "and when Marty's work was done, the ball was out of the lot <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> second base".|$|E
