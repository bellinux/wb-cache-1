25|$|On April 23, 1999, Via Rail Train No. 74 {{travelling}} eastward at Mile 46.7 on the Canadian National Chatham Subdivision in Thamesville, Ontario derailed after {{a switch}} was left open by a CN worker causing {{the train to}} jump the tracks and collide with stationary hoppers on the <b>adjacent</b> <b>track,</b> derailing the locomotive and its 4 passenger cars. The 2 engineers were killed and 77 of the 186 passengers injured, 4 seriously. Approximately 50 m of the main track and 100 m of the yard track were destroyed.|$|E
500|$|The trains left Liverpool on {{time and}} without any {{technical}} problems. The Duke of Wellington's special train ran on one track, and the other seven trains ran on an adjacent and parallel track, sometimes ahead and sometimes behind the Duke's train. Around [...] out of Liverpool {{the first of many}} problems occurred, when one of the trains derailed and the following train collided with it. With no reported injuries or damage, the derailed locomotive was lifted back onto the track and the journey continued. At Parkside railway station, near the midpoint of the line, the locomotives made a scheduled stop to take on water. Although the railway staff advised passengers to remain on the trains while this took place, around 50 of the dignitaries on board alighted when the Duke of Wellington's special train stopped. One of those who got off was William Huskisson, former cabinet minister and Member of Parliament for Liverpool. Huskisson had been a highly influential figure {{in the creation of the}} British Empire and an architect of the doctrine of free trade, but had fallen out with Wellington in 1828 over the issue of parliamentary reform and had resigned from the cabinet. Hoping to be reconciled with Wellington, he approached the Duke's railway carriage and shook his hand. Distracted by the Duke, he did not notice an approaching locomotive on the <b>adjacent</b> <b>track,</b> Rocket. On realising it was approaching he panicked and tried to clamber into the Duke's carriage, but the door of the carriage swung open leaving him hanging directly in the path of the oncoming Rocket. He fell onto the tracks in front of the train, suffering serious leg injuries and dying later that night.|$|E
50|$|Loco ACDs brake {{to reduce}} the train speed to 15 km/h if on approach. They receive {{messages}} from each other ACDs on <b>adjacent</b> <b>tracks.</b> If inbound ACDs of other trains read 'train parted', the trains decelerate until they have stopped to prevent dangerous side collisions that can occur when <b>adjacent</b> <b>tracks</b> have been damaged.|$|R

50|$|From time to time, {{railways}} {{are asked}} to transport exceptional loads such as massive electrical transformers that are too tall, too wide or too heavy to operate normally.

For example, <b>adjacent</b> <b>tracks</b> of a double line {{might have to be}} shut down to avoid collisions with trains on those <b>adjacent</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In Canadian and American {{practice}} all of {{the forces}} between the locomotive and cars are handled through the coupler – particularly the Janney coupler, long standard on American railroad rolling stock – and its associated draft gear, which allows some limited slack movement. Small dimples called [...] "poling pockets" [...] at {{the front and rear}} corners of the locomotive allowed cars to be pushed onto an <b>adjacent</b> <b>track</b> using a pole braced between the locomotive and the cars. In Britain and Europe, North American style [...] "buckeye" [...] and other couplers that handle forces between items of rolling stock have become increasingly popular.|$|E
2500|$|The NTSB {{also stated}} that a {{railroad}} switch showed evidence of damage consistent with the Metrolink passenger train [...] "running through" [...] the trailing switch points while they were set to allow the freight train to proceed onto the <b>adjacent</b> <b>track,</b> forcing {{them out of the}} way. [...] "The switch bars were bent like a banana. It should be perfectly straight," [...] according to the NTSB official. The NTSB member in charge of the investigative team said they were also concerned with possible fatigue issues related to the engineer's split shift. The engineer worked an 11.5-hour shift split with a 3.5-hour break, leaving only nine hours away from work between workdays.|$|E
60|$|Sir Charles, I {{ought to}} say, had secured during that summer a very {{advantageous}} option {{in a part}} of Africa on the Transvaal frontier, rumoured to be auriferous. Now, whether it was auriferous or not before, the mere fact that Charles had secured some claim on it naturally made it so; for no man had ever the genuine Midas-touch to a greater degree than Charles Vandrift: whatever he handles turns at once to gold, if not to diamonds. Therefore, as soon as my brother-in-law had obtained this option from the native vendor (a most respected chief, by name Montsioa), and promoted a company of his own to develop it, his great rival in that region, Lord Craig-Ellachie (formerly Sir David Alexander Granton), immediately secured a similar option of an <b>adjacent</b> <b>track,</b> the larger part of which had pretty much the same geological conditions as that covered by Sir Charles's right of pre-emption.|$|E
