5|$|Mimicry {{occurs when}} an {{organism}} (the mimic) simulates signal properties of another organism (the model) to confuse a third organism. This {{results in the}} mimic gaining protection, food, and mating advantages. There are two classical types of defensive mimicry: Batesian and Müllerian. Both involve <b>aposematic</b> <b>coloration,</b> or warning signals, to avoid being attacked by a predator.|$|E
5|$|Poison dart frogs are {{an example}} of an aposematic organism. Their bright {{coloration}} advertises unpalatability to potential predators. Aposematism is currently thought to have originated at least four times within the poison dart family according to phylogenetic trees, and dendrobatid frogs have since undergone dramatic divergences – both interspecific and intraspecific – in their <b>aposematic</b> <b>coloration.</b> This is surprising given the frequency-dependent nature of this type of defense mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} insects are toxic or distasteful {{when they have}} fed on certain plants that contain {{chemicals}} of particular classes, but not when they have fed on plants that lack those chemicals. For instance, some species of the subfamily Danainae feed on various species of the Asclepiadoideae in the family Apocynaceae, which render them poisonous and emetic to most predators. Such insects frequently are aposematically coloured and patterned. When feeding on innocuous plants however, they are harmless and nutritious, but a bird that once has sampled a toxic specimen is unlikely to eat harmless specimens that have the same <b>aposematic</b> <b>coloration.</b> When regarded as mimicry of toxic {{members of the same}} species, this too may be seen as automimicry.|$|E

25|$|The insects {{advertise}} these defenses with <b>aposematic</b> bright <b>coloration,</b> unusual postures, odours, or, in adults, ultrasonic vibrations. Some mimic moths {{that are}} poisonous or wasps that sting. The ultrasound signals help nocturnal predators {{to learn to}} avoid the moths, and for some species can jam bat echolocation.|$|R
5|$|Open water {{fish are}} usually {{streamlined}} like torpedoes to minimize turbulence {{as they move}} through the water. Reef fish live in a complex, relatively confined underwater landscape and for them, manoeuvrability {{is more important than}} speed, and many of them have developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and change direction. Many have laterally compressed bodies (flattened from side to side) allowing them to fit into fissures and swim through narrow gaps; some use their pectoral fins for locomotion and others undulate their dorsal and anal fins. Some fish have grown dermal (skin) appendages for camouflage; the prickly leather-jacket is almost invisible among the seaweed it resembles and the tasselled scorpionfish invisibly lurks on the seabed ready to ambush prey. Some like the foureye butterflyfish have eyespots to startle or deceive, while others such as lionfish have <b>aposematic</b> <b>coloration</b> to warn that they are toxic or have venomous spines.|$|E
5|$|In Batesian mimicry, {{the mimic}} {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, {{known as the}} model, to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it were}} distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of the model and the abundance of the model in the geographical area. The more toxic the model is, {{the more likely it is}} that the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance of the model species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When the model is abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where the model is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate <b>aposematic</b> <b>coloration.</b> This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance that they are the model species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae).|$|E
25|$|Some {{caterpillars}} are gregarious; large aggregations {{are believed}} to help in reducing the levels of parasitization and predation. Clusters amplify the signal of <b>aposematic</b> <b>coloration,</b> and individuals may participate in group regurgitation or displays.|$|E
50|$|The {{critically}} anthropomorphic {{approach has}} been applied to numerous species and behavioral and cognitive capacities. Burghardt and Rivas describe case histories of how critical anthropomorphism informed the design and interpretation of animal behavior research. The examples include foraging tactics in snakes, <b>aposematic</b> (warning) <b>coloration,</b> courtship behavior in the Drosophila fruit fly, language and communication, zoo exhibit design, and conservation planning for wildlife management. Rivas and Burghardt also used critical anthropomorphism to explain female biased sexual dimorphism in anacondas and other snakes.|$|R
40|$|Anurans may be {{brightly colored}} or {{completely}} cryptic. Generally, {{in the former}} situation, {{we are dealing with}} aposematism, and the latter is an example of camouflage. However, these are only simple views of what such colorations really mean and which defensive strategy is implied. For instance, a brightly colored frog may be part of a mimicry ring, which could be either Batesian, M&# 252;llerian, or Browerian. These are only examples of the diversity of color-usage systems as defensive strategies. Unfortunately, reports on the use of colors as defensive mechanisms are widespread in the available literature, and the possible functions are rarely mentioned. Therefore, we reviewed the literature and added new data to this subject. Then, we the use of colors (as defensive mechanism) into categories. Mimicry was divided into the subcategories camouflage, homotypy, and nondeceitful homotypy, and these groups were also subcategorized. Dissuasive coloration was divided into behavioral display of colors, polymorphism, and polyphenism. Aposematism was treated apart, but <b>aposematic</b> <b>colorations</b> may be present in other defensive strategies. Finally, we propose functions and forms of evolution for some color systems in post-metamorphic anurans and hope that this review can be the basis for future research, even on other animal groups...|$|R
50|$|The Atala is a {{great example}} of <b>aposematic</b> (warning) <b>coloration</b> {{throughout}} its life cycle. The brightly colored larva or caterpillar feeds on cycads which contain a toxic secondary plant chemical (cycasin) which it retains in its body for life. Birds, lizards, and other animals may attempt to prey on the larva, pupa, and adults, but find them distasteful and learn to avoid these brightly patterned insects. In Florida, the larvae feed on a native cycad, Zamia pumila, called coontie, as well as introduced ornamental cycads. In Cuba, the cycad Cycas revoluta is eaten.|$|R
25|$|Many regions {{have been}} {{reported}} which were originally home for P. fuscatus have slowly altered to that of P. dominula. A few possible factors contribute to the prevalence of P. dominula over P. fuscatus, specifically in settling into a territory. Some of the factors include productive colony cycle, short developmental time, <b>aposematic</b> <b>coloration,</b> a generalist diet, {{and the ability to}} colonize new environment.|$|E
25|$|Hemipepsis ustulata {{and fellow}} members of its tribe of Pepsini {{tarantula}} hawks {{are well known}} for the <b>aposematic</b> <b>coloration.</b> They range from shiny black to blue-black with bright yellow, orange, or red wings – classic warning colors warning experienced predators to stay away and keeping naïve predators wary. Tarantula hawks also emit an aposematic odor, which deters predators. Such a foul odor, associated with an excruciatingly painful sting, makes a strong impression on predators, keeping them away.|$|E
25|$|Another {{strength}} of P. dominula {{in terms of}} survivorship is their ability to suffer less nest predation than other Polistes. P. dominula is a less attractive prey for birds mainly due to its <b>aposematic</b> <b>coloration</b> and the relatively strong attachment of the comb to the substrate – typically tree branches or man-made structures. Unlike P. fuscatus, which is colored brown with a few faint, thin, yellow stripes, P. dominula is colored bright yellow with alternating black, similar to the warning coloration of Vespula germanica, a common and aggressive yellowjacket. In addition to their alerting coloration, P. dominula comb strength also contributes to their higher chance of survivorship. P. dominula might have an advantage over P. fuscatus against avian predators because their combs {{are less likely to}} be dislodged from the substrate by birds because the side force required to dislodge it is greater for P. dominula than for P. fuscatus combs.|$|E
50|$|Some hemipterans such as firebugs have bold <b>aposematic</b> warning <b>coloration,</b> often red and black, {{which appear}} to deter {{passerine}} birds. Many hemipterans including aphids, scale insects {{and especially the}} planthoppers secrete wax {{to protect themselves from}} threats such as fungi, parasitoidal insects and predators, as well as abiotic factors like desiccation. Hard waxy coverings are especially important in the sedentary Sternorrhyncha such as scale insects, which have no means of escape from predators; other Sternorrhyncha evade detection and attack by creating and living inside plant galls. Nymphal Cicadoidea and Cercopoidea have glands attached to the Malpighian tubules in their proximal segment that produce mucopolysaccharides, which form the froth around spittlebugs, offering a measure of protection.|$|R
50|$|Skunks are {{reluctant}} to use this weapon, as they carry just enough of the chemical {{for five or six}} uses - about 15 cc - and require some ten days to produce another supply. Their bold black and white coloration makes their appearance memorable. It is to a skunk's advantage to warn possible predators off without expending scent: black and white <b>aposematic</b> warning <b>coloration</b> aside, threatened skunks will go through an elaborate routine of hisses, foot-stamping, and tail-high deimatic or threat postures before resorting to spraying. Skunks usually do not spray other skunks, except among males in the mating season. If they fight over den space in autumn, they do so with teeth and claws.|$|R
500|$|Bumblebees have round bodies {{covered in}} soft hair (long {{branched}} setae) called pile, making them appear and feel fuzzy. They have <b>aposematic</b> (warning) <b>coloration,</b> often consisting of contrasting bands of colour, and {{different species of}} bumblebee in a region often resemble each other in mutually protective Müllerian mimicry. Harmless insects such as hoverflies often derive protection from resembling bumblebees, in Batesian mimicry, and may be confused with them. [...] Nest-making bumblebees can be distinguished from similarly large, fuzzy cuckoo bees by {{the form of the}} female hind leg. In nesting bumblebees, it is modified to form a pollen basket, a bare shiny area surrounded by a fringe of hairs used to transport pollen, whereas in cuckoo bees, the hind leg is hairy all round, and pollen grains are wedged among the hairs for transport.|$|R

25|$|Müllerian mimicry. Müller's great {{discovery}} {{concerned the}} resemblance between {{two or more}} unpalatable species which are protected from predators capable of learning. The protection is often a noxious chemical, perhaps gained from the larva eating a particular plant; {{or it may be}} a sting or other defence. It is an advantage for such potential prey to advertise their status in a way clearly perceptible to their predators; this is called <b>aposematic</b> or warning <b>coloration.</b> The principle is of wide application, but in Muller's case the prey were butterflies, and the predators usually birds or reptiles.|$|R
40|$|Thorns, spines and prickles {{are some}} of the anti-herbivore {{defenses}} that plants have evolved. They were recently found to be commonly <b>aposematic</b> (warning <b>coloration).</b> However, the physical anti-herbivore defense executed by these sharp structures seems to be only the tip of the iceberg. We show that thorns of various plant species commonly harbor an array of aerobic and anaerobic pathogenic bacteria including Clostridium perfringens the causative agent of the life-threatening gas gangrene, Bacillus anthracis, and Pantoea agglomerans. Septic inflammation caused by plant thorn injury can result not only from bacteria. Medical literature indicates that thorns, spines or prickles also introduce pathogenic fungi into animals or humans. Dermatophytes that cause subcutaneous mycoses are unable to penetrate the skin and must be introduced into the subcutaneous tissue by a puncture wound. The common microorganism-thorn combinations seem to have been an important contributor to {{the fact that so many}} plant thorns are aposematically colored, as a case of convergent evolution of aposematism in these organisms...|$|R
40|$|Warning (<b>aposematic)</b> and cryptic <b>colorations</b> {{appear to}} be {{mutually}} incompat-ible because the primary function of the former is to increase detectability, whereas {{the function of the}} latter is to decrease it. Disruptive coloration is a type of crypsis in which the color pattern breaks up the outline of the prey, thus hindering its detection. This delusion can work even when the prey’s pat-tern elements are highly contrasting; thus, it is possible for an animal’s col-oration to combine both warning and disruptive functions. The coloration of the wood tiger moth (Parasemia plantaginis) is such that the moth is conspicu-ous when it rests on vegetation, but when it feigns death and drops to the grass- and litter-covered ground, it is hard to detect. This death-feigning behav-ior therefore immediately switches the function of its coloration from signaling to camouflage. We experimentally tested whether the forewing patterning of wood tiger moths could function as disruptive coloration against certain back-grounds.

50|$|Aposematism, or warning coloration, {{is another}} factor that {{influences}} anti-predator behavior. For example, the coral snake exhibits <b>aposematic</b> <b>coloration</b> that can be mimicked. While garter snakes do not exhibit mimicry or <b>aposematic</b> <b>coloration,</b> {{it has been found}} that garter snakes with striped patterns are more likely to slowly, successively slither away, while spotted and not striped snakes were more likely to deceptively flee from predators.|$|E
50|$|Agathidines {{are among}} the larger and more {{colorful}} braconids. Diurnal members of this subfamily often possess <b>aposematic</b> <b>coloration.</b> They belong to the noncyclostome group.|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of aposematism {{is considered to}} be a major evolutionary problem because if new aposematic forms emerged in defended cryptic populations, they would face the dual problems of rarity and conspicuousness. We argue that this commonly assumed starting point might not have wide validity. We describe a novel evolutionary computer model in which prey evolve secondary defences and become conspicuous by moving widely over a visually heterogeneous habitat. Unless crypsis imposes high opportunity costs (for instance, preventing prey from efficient foraging, thermoregulation and communication), costly secondary defences are not predicted to evolve at all. However, when crypsis imposes opportunity costs, prey evolve secondary defences that facilitate raised behavioural conspicuousness as prey exploit opportunities within their environment. Optimal levels of secondary defence and of behavioural conspicuousness increase with population sizes and the costs imposed by crypsis. When prey are already conspicuous by virtue of their behaviours, the {{evolution of}} <b>aposematic</b> appearances (bright <b>coloration,</b> etc.) is much easier to explain because aposematic traits add little further costs of conspicuousness, but can bring large benefits...|$|R
40|$|On close examination, human {{cultural}} artifacts {{bear the}} unmistakable impress {{of the structure}} of the human mind: our tools, habitations. and methods of communication have been molded to suit the strengths and limitations of the human cognitive system (Nosman 1988). It has not commonly been emphasized. however. that similar shaping processes have taken place over the course of biological evolution in response to the cognitive features of other, nonhuman species (Bonner 1980; von Frisch 1974). Cognitive influences are particularly evident in the modifications of color patterns and behavior of prey species that take advantage of biases and constraints in the perceptual systems of their principal predators. For example, avoidance learning by predators contributes to the evolution of <b>aposematic.</b> or warning, <b>coloration</b> in many distasteful or poisonous species (Guilford 1990; Schuler and Roper 1992); Batesian mimicry (Bates 1862). in which palatable prey evolve to imitate the appearance of aposematic species. takes advantage of the predator 2 ̆ 7 s tendency to generalize stimuli (Oaten et al. 1975). But perhaps the most striking illustration of the effects of predator cognition on prey appearance is the large number of species of cryptically colored insects that are polymorphic, with a single species occurring naturally in a variety of disparate forms...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the timing of}} the crepuscular lekking flight of male ghost swift moths in southern Sweden with respect to variations in: (i) the quality of the visual mating signal; and (ii) the behaviour of potential vertebrate predators (mainly bats). The moths' display flights started ca. 57 min after sunset, and occurred during 20 – 30 min at incident light intensities between 10. 0 and 2. 0 lux. Owing to the falling and more shortwave ambient light after sunset, the brightness contrast between the moth wings and the background (grass) increased steeply at the time of display onset. The silvery white male wing colour thereby seems to maximize conspicuousness, and may be a secondary adaptation that facilitates visibility at low light intensities. The display timing itself is probably determined by other factors, possibly predation. By displaying only for a short period at dusk, the moths seem to avoid most birds, which normally do not forage at these light levels, and gleaning bats, which typically do not start to feed until the light intensity has fallen even further. Nevertheless, aerial-hawking bats were often (54 % of the evenings, n = 22) seen at the leks, and one species (Eptesicus nilssonii) frequently fed on the displaying moths (22 % of the moths observed, n = 83). H. humuli represents an ancient clade among the Lepidoptera. By restricting its sexual behaviour to a short time window at dusk, when predation risk may be minimized (but still high), it may to some extent compensate for the lack of sophisticated predator defence systems such as <b>aposematic</b> or mimetic <b>coloration,</b> manoeuvrable flight, and ultrasonic hearing, which predominate among the more recent Lepidopteran clades. However, the time window solution restricts the moths' activities considerably and the lack of defence still carries a considerable cost in terms of predation...|$|R

40|$|Warning (<b>aposematic)</b> and cryptic <b>colorations</b> {{appear to}} be {{mutually}} incompatible because the primary function of the former is to increase detectability, whereas {{the function of the}} latter is to decrease it. Disruptive coloration is a type of crypsis in which the color pattern breaks up the outline of the prey, thus hindering its detection. This delusion can work even when the prey’s pattern elements are highly contrasting; thus, it is possible for an animal’s coloration to combine both warning and disruptive functions. The coloration of the wood tiger moth (Parasemia plantaginis) is such that the moth is conspicuous when it rests on vegetation, but when it feigns death and drops to the grass- and litter-covered ground, it is hard to detect. This death-feigning behavior therefore immediately switches the function of its coloration from signaling to camouflage. We experimentally tested whether the forewing patterning of wood tiger moths could function as disruptive coloration against certain backgrounds. Using actual forewing patterns of wood tiger moths, we crafted artifi- cial paper moths and placed them on a background image resembling a natural litter and grass background. We manipulated the disruptiveness of the wing pattern so that all (marginal pattern) or none (nonmarginal pattern) of the markings extended {{to the edge of the}} wing. Paper moths, each with a hidden palatable food item, were offered to great tits (Parus major) in a large aviary where the birds could search for and attack the “moths” according to their detectability. The results showed that prey items with the disruptive marginal pattern were attacked less often than prey without it. However, the disruptive function was apparent only when the prey was brighter than the background. These results suggest that warning coloration and disruptive coloration can work in concert and that the moth, by feigning death, can switch the function of its coloration from warning to disruptive...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the perceptual and cognitive abilities of predatory birds {{and the appearance of}} their insect prey has long been of intense interest to evolutionary biologists. One classic example is crypsis, the correspondence between the appearance of prey species and of the substrates on which they rest which has long been considered a prime illustration of effects of natural selection, in this case operating against individuals that were more readily detected by predators (Poulton 1890; Wallace 1891). But the influences of predator psychology are broader, more complex, and more subtle than just pattern matching. Many cryptic prey, including the underwing moths (Catocala) that rest against tree bark in the daytime, are also polymorphic. This discontinuous variation in appearance is thought to make prey harder to find initially and harder to detect even after the predator has learned of their appearance (Poulton 1890). In contrast to cryptic prey, other prey appear to have taken the opposite route, being quite conspicuous in appearance. The <b>aposematic</b> or warning <b>coloration</b> displayed by many distasteful or poisonous species appears to facilitate avoidance learning by predators (Guilford 1990; Schuler 2 ̆ 6 Roper 1992). Batesian mimicry (Bates 1862), in which palatable prey evolve to imitate the appearance of aposematic species, appears {{to take advantage of the}} predator 2 ̆ 7 s tendency to stimulus generalization (Oaten et al. 1975). Even a century after many of these ideas were first proposed, however, much of the work in this area is still based on correlational data or on experiments that bear only indirectly on the issue. The reason lies in part in the intractable nature of hypotheses about behavioral evolution. Behavior lacks a substantive fossil record, which means that any account of its origins must necessarily be inferential. Worse, behavioral evolution usually involves a dynamic interplay between the behavior and the environment that is difficult to reconstruct adequately under controlled conditions. As a result, even inferential investigations of the phenomenon generally bear only indirectly on the conditions under which the behavior actually evolved. To circumvent this constraint, we have developed an experimental method that allows realistic, repeatable simulation of the original processes involved in the evolution of color patterns in prey organisms. This 2 ̆ 2 virtual ecology 2 ̆ 2 technique provides an innovative approach to the experimental study of evolutionary dynamics and a quantum improvement in the ability to test evolutionary hypotheses. Our purpose in this chapter is to describe the development of the virtual ecology technique as the product of the cross-fertilization of ideas from a variety of disciplines, including operant psychology, behavioral ecology, population dynamics, and evolutionary computer algorithms. We have chosen to do this in a personal, autobiographical way in an attempt to communicate the flavor of what it has actually been like to experience these developments. In order to be historically accurate, we needed to emphasize the roles of coincidence and happenstance as well as of knowledge and synthesis in this process. We hope that the chapter will be fun to read and that it will provide useful insight into one example of how scientific research actually takes place...|$|R
