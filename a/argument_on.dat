40|$|Zeno of Elea, {{despite being}} among the most {{important}} of the Pre-Socratic philosophers, is frequently overlooked by philosophers and scientists alike in modern times.

5|$|Her {{position}} {{changed the}} following month. She {{had had a}} series of rows with Bamber. He seemed to want to end the relationship, and they had argued about his involvement in the murders. She told him he was a psychopath and at one point tried to smother him with a pillow. During one <b>argument</b> <b>on</b> 4 September, another woman telephoned Bamber in her presence, and it became clear to Mugford that he had been seeing that woman too. Mugford smashed a mirror, slapped Bamber and he twisted her arm up her back. Three days later she went to the police and changed her statement.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} who, if anyone, {{was in charge}} of the ship at this point, as Luke Collingwood had been gravely ill for some time. The man who would {{normally}} have replaced him, first mate James Kelsall, had been previously suspended from duty following an <b>argument</b> <b>on</b> 14November. Robert Stubbs had captained a slave ship several decades earlier and he temporarily commanded Zong during Collingwood's incapacitation, but he was not a registered member of the vessel's crew. According to historian James Walvin, the breakdown of the command structure on the ship might explain the subsequent navigational errors and the absence of checks on supplies of drinking water.|$|E

Jack and Eddie, after feuding, later bond and they even decide to invite their sisters (Molly Shannon and Siobhan Fallon Hogan) and brother-in-law (Boris McGiver) to 30 Rock for an impromptu family reunion. As his family are about to watch a taping of TGS, Jack's supposedly dead father visits Jack in his office, {{claiming that}} Eddie is dead. This eventually leads to an <b>argument</b> <b>on</b> the TGS stage and Liz getting beaten up by one of Jack's sisters, Katherine Catherine.|$|E

5|$|Mulla Sadra (c. 1571/2 – 1640) was an Iranian Shia Islamic philosopher who was {{influenced}} by earlier Muslim philosophers such as Avicenna and Suhrawardi, {{as well as the}} Sufi metaphysician Ibn 'Arabi. Sadra discussed Avicenna's arguments for the existence of God, claiming that they were not a priori. He rejected the <b>argument</b> <b>on</b> the basis that existence precedes essence, or that the existence of human beings is more fundamental than their essence.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 2010, the Supreme Court {{ordered the}} appeals court to reconsider its {{decision}} to rescind the death penalty, with the same three-judge panel convening in Philadelphia on November 9, 2010, to hear oral <b>argument.</b> <b>On</b> April 26, 2011, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reaffirmed its prior decision to vacate the death sentence {{on the grounds that}} the jury instructions and verdict form were ambiguous and confusing.

5|$|Qiyas or analogical {{reason is}} the fourth source of the sharia for the {{majority}} of Sunni jurisprudence. It aims to draw analogies to a previously accepted decision. Shiites do not accept analogy, but replace it with reason (aql); among Sunnis, the Hanbalites have traditionally been reluctant to accept analogy while the Zahirites don't accept it at all. Analogical reason in Islam is the process of legal deduction according to which the jurist, confronted with an unprecedented case, bases his or her <b>argument</b> <b>on</b> the logic used in the Qur'an and Sunnah. Legally sound analogy must not be based on arbitrary judgment, but rather be firmly rooted in the primary sources.|$|E

5|$|Although Roosevelt, {{most of his}} aides, Johnson, and the NRA staff {{felt the}} Act would survive a court test, the U.S. Department of Justice had on March 25, 1935, {{declined}} to appeal an appellate court ruling overturning the lumber industry code {{on the grounds that}} the case was not a good test of the NIRA's constitutionality. The Justice Department's action worried many in the administration. But on April 1, 1935 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the NIRA in the Schechter case. Although Donald Richberg and others felt the government's case in Schechter was not a strong one, the Schechters were determined to appeal their conviction. So the government appealed first, and the Supreme Court heard oral <b>argument</b> <b>on</b> May 2 and 3.|$|E
5|$|The Islamic Andalusi philosopher Averroes or Ibn Rushd (11261198) {{criticized the}} <b>argument</b> <b>on</b> its methodology. Averroes, an avid Aristotelian, argued that God's {{existence}} {{has to be}} shown {{on the basis of}} the natural world, as Aristotle had done. According to Averroes, a proof should be based on physics, and not on metaphysical reflections as in the Proof of the Truthful. Other Muslim philosophers such as Al-Ghazali (10581111) attacked the argument over its implications that seemed incompatible with God as known through the Islamic revelation. For example, according to Avicenna, God can have no features or relations that are contingent, so his causing of the universe must be necessary. Al-Ghazali disputed this as incompatible with the concept of God's untrammelled free will as taught in Al-Ghazali's Asharite theology. He further argued that God's free choice can be shown by the arbitrary nature of the exact size of the universe or the time of its creation.|$|E
