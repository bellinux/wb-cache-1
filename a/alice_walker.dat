40|$|Abstract: African American {{literature}} has been predominantly a male-preserve {{in the task}} of narrating the experience of slavery and its relics of denigration {{before the advent of}} reactionary literature by black female writers. Studies on female-authored African American literary works have concentrated on responding to male-authored representations of the tensions of racism, internal crisis of man-woman relationships and the challenges of empowering the black female character. This paper focuses on the exploration of assertive female characters through a concerted consciousness-awakening among African American women within a cycle of oppression. This study, therefore, investigates the narrative thrust of <b>Alice</b> <b>Walker’s</b> The Color Purple against the back drop of the Civil Rights era on female character portrayal. The study adopts <b>Alice</b> <b>Walker’s</b> womanist theory which accounts for the construction of black women consciousness and advocates for a more integrative societal structure. A close reading of the novel, The Color Purple (1982) reveals that <b>Alice</b> <b>Walker’s</b> narrative keeps within the womanist tradition and exemplifies the Civil Rights era while situating the novel within specific historical, socio-political, economic, gendered and literary context...|$|R

25|$|However, not all womanists {{hold this}} view of Feminism.

25|$|For a {{majority}} of black women feminism has failed to accurately and holistically describe them as individuals {{to the world that}} surrounds them. They feel as though it takes something new that is not already bound to a predetermined master in order to capture this new movement. Womanism is something that <b>Alice</b> <b>Walker</b> can completely identify with without having second thoughts; it feels natural to her. Feminism does not. When distinguishing between feminism and womanism {{it is important to remember}} that many women find womanism easier to identify with. In addition, a key component of a womanist discourse is the role that spirituality and ethics has on ending the interlocking oppression of race, gender, and class that circumscribes the lives of African-American women.|$|E
