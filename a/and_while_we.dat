He found {{references}} to older Madonna videos, like [...] "Express Yourself" [...] in the [...] "unusual choreography {{with all of}} its masculine posturing and grappling", [...] "Take a Bow" [...] with its bullfighting theme and playing on a familiar imagery from her career, and [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] during the sequences where Madonna fends off the Minotaur dancers. Virtel also commended the choreography, costumes, Madonna's looks and the cinematography of the video. Along with the [...] "Take a Bow" [...] reference, Billboards Joe Lynch called the video as incredible and [...] "lush, arresting" [...] but criticized for the misspelling of Nietzsche at the end." [...] Rita Kokshanian from InStyle said that the video was [...] "just as good as you could have expected... <b>And</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> were completely transfixed by her killer moves and insane physique, we were equally in awe of her outfits." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{screening}} for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo {{took place on}} November 28, 2011, {{as part of a}} critics-only event hosted by the New York Film Critics Circle. Commentators at the event predicted that while the film would become a contender for several accolades, it would likely not become a forerunner in the pursuit for Academy Award nominations. A promotional campaign commenced thereafter, including a Lisbeth Salander-inspired collection, designed by Trish Summerville for H. The worldwide premiere was at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on December 12, 2011, followed by the American opening at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on December 14 and Stockholm the next day. Sony's target demographics were men and women over the age of 25 and 17–34. The film went into general release in North America on December 21, at 2,700 theaters, expanding to 2,974 theaters on its second day. The United Kingdom release was on December 26, Russia on January 1, 2012, and Japan on February 13. India and Vietnam releases were abandoned due to censorship concerns. A press statement from the Central Board of Film Certification stated: [...] "Sony Pictures will not be releasing The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in India. The censor board has judged the film unsuitable for public viewing in its unaltered form <b>and,</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> are committed to maintaining and protecting the vision of the director, we will, as always, respect the guidelines set by the board." [...] In contrast, the National Film Board of Vietnam insisted that the film's withdrawal had no relation to rigid censorship guidelines, as it had not been reviewed by the committee.|$|E
500|$|... "All Around the World" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Jenna Rubenstein of MTV {{thought that the}} [...] "fist-pumping club banger" [...] is a complete departure from Bieber's previous work, while Diadem Pambid of the International Business Times stated that the singer joined the [...] "'synth-pop' bandwagon" [...] along with Britney Spears, Chris Brown and Usher. Jocelyn Vena also of MTV stated that the song could have been recorded by Usher, due to its [...] "grinding, fist-pumping" [...] background. Entertainment Weekly columnist Ray Rahman gave [...] "All Around the World" [...] a positive review, and stated: [...] "a Euro beat worthy of The Wanted? The vocal swagger of Chris Brown? Lyrics smacking of One Direction? Check, check, and check, please!" [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect rated [...] "All Around the World" [...] five out of five stars, and commented that the track {{is not only a}} sequel to [...] "Baby", but is also [...] "a whole new level for pop itself." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator explained that the song {{is a good example of}} how Bieber is taking [...] "baby steps to 'swaggy' adulthood through the evolution of his music — keep the content G-Rated, but make the beat something the older club-going crowd can enjoy. So far, it’s working." [...] Amy Sciaretto of Pop Crush gave the track a mixed review, and deemed it as highly similar to the work of Spears, stating: [...] "If you told us this song was penned for Britney Spears for her last album Femme Fatale, we'd Believe it, because the computerized style and the thick vocal effects remind us of recent Brit material. It's safe to say that 'All Around the World' is a club banger. <b>And</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> love Bieber, it's not our favorite song on Believe so far." ...|$|E

When asked the question in one interview, Wehrkamp explained that [...] "We have always been more a studio band than a performing band unfortunately, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> rehearsed for a tour just before Tyranny was started, a few obstacles blocked our touring options, and we were locked back in the studio to make another record. I know {{there are many people}} who cannot understand why we haven't played in support of this record, and I can see why they feel that way, but honestly, it's very difficult." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the Champions Trophy, in October 2009 Wright {{was called}} up to England's Test squad {{for the first time}} for the winter tour of South Africa. His {{inclusion}} was to fill the all-rounder's spot vacated by Andrew Flintoff's retirement after the 2009 Ashes. Geoff Miller, England's chairman of selectors, said [...] "The retirement of Andrew Flintoff has created a vacancy for an all-rounder in the squad <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> do not see Luke Wright as a like for like replacement for Andrew, we are excited by the way in which his all-round game continues to develop and believe he can make an impact at Test level". Wright was expected to play in the first Test, however England chose to go with 6 batsmen and chose Ian Bell in a match that ended as a draw.|$|E
2500|$|While at Stanford, Thiel {{encountered}} René Girard, whose mimetic theory influenced him. Mimetic theory {{posits that}} human behavior {{is based upon}} mimesis, and that imitation can engender pointless conflict. Girard notes the productive potential of competition: [...] "It is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially, if not individually, acceptable that {{we have all the}} amazing achievements of the modern world," [...] but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself: [...] "rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another." [...] Thiel applied this theory to his personal life and business ventures, stating: [...] "The big problem with competition is that it focuses us on the people around us, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> get better at the things we're competing on, we lose sight of anything that's important, or transcendent, or truly meaningful in our world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kentucky Rifleman William Atherton's memoirs {{testify to}} the skill of the Essex men and natives at bush fighting, stating [...] "the fight now became very close, and {{extremely}} hot ... I received a wound in my right shoulder." [...] The moment before Atherton was hit, he witnessed two of his fellow riflemen move too far forward. One was killed and the other wounded. Atherton described the tactics used by Ebenezer Reynolds and his Canadians: [...] "Their method was to retreat rapidly until {{they were out of}} sight (which was soon the case in the brushy woods) <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> were advancing they were preparing to give us another fire; so we were generally under the necessity of firing upon them as they were retreating." [...] Another Kentucky private had similar recollections: [...] "As we advanced they were firing themselves behind logs, trees, etc. to the best advantage." [...] After a long, bloody and exhaustive withdrawal over two miles of woodland, the Canadians and natives slipped away, leaving Frenchtown to the Kentuckians. This skirmish would later be called as the First Battle of the River Raisin.|$|E
2500|$|During the 15th century {{opinion was}} more evenly split {{as to the}} nature of the Pyramids. [...] An {{anonymous}} traveler in 1420 speaks of going [...] "to see the most marvelous fourteen granaries of Pharaoh, five or six miles distant from Cairo." [...] He continues, [...] "you must cross the river Nile that flows from the Earthly Paradise ... and from the top [...] there is a good view of the very large city of Cairo. [...] But there, around these granaries, there is such a great colony of rats that it sometimes seems as if they cover the entire ground." [...] In 1436 the Spaniard Pero Tafur visited and left a rather fanciful account: [...] "We went to see the Granaries of Joseph, which are three leagues from the mouth of the river, in the desert. Although they say that there are many more further inland, there are only three here, two great ones, and one lesser one. They are diamond shaped, with the apex raised, and they must be much higher than the Great Tower at Seville. As one enters through the door there is a wall joined to another, making a circular stairway which reaches to the top, with many windows. And the beasts, when they are laden, climb up and are unloaded through those windows, and so they fill the granaries to the top. [...] Certainly I never thought that there was such a great building in the world to-day, nor have I seen the like before or since." [...] Another curious interpretation was offered by Georges Lengherand, Mayor of Mons, who visited in 1486: [...] "These granaries are very marvelous buildings and there used to be fourteen and now there are only six or seven. [...] It is impossible to enter, and they are all of dressed stone ... and are in the manner of a hill ... <b>And</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> were there, we found four wolves asleep on the stones ... And around these granaries are small little chambers, several cut into the rock; I do not know what could be their use, unless at the time theses granaries were in existence there were guards in these little chambers." [...] The German traveler Arnold von Harff paid a visit in 1497 and left a fairly objective report: [...] "We went across the Nile to these three Kassa Pharaonis. [...] As we approached near these three towers we saw that they were very strange buildings ... We climbed up outside for three full hours to the top, which is about two roods square. [...] From there we saw far out over the whole of the land of Egypt, and over the country to Alexandria and the western sea ... They say that King Pharaoh caused the towers to be built during the lean years, and kept them full of corn. [...] That is why they are called the Kassa Pharaonis. [...] But I could find no entrance. [...] Some say that they are the tombs of the old kings of Egypt." ...|$|E
