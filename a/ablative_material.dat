40|$|Introduction: An {{efficient}} Thermal Protection System (TPS) {{is mandatory}} to protect re-entry space vehicles from the severe heating encountered during hypersonic flight through a planet or the Earth atmosphere. <b>Ablative</b> <b>materials</b> represent a traditional approach to thermal protection, used for over 50 {{years in a}} broad range of applications. The Laboratory of Materials and Surface Engineering (LIMS) of Sapienza University of Rome has developed carbon-phenolic <b>ablative</b> <b>materials</b> with several densities and compositions. This work has the aim of improving the <b>ablative</b> <b>materials</b> performances by means of nano-fillers addition. The addition of ZrO 2 nanoparticles can modify bulk properties, such as mechanical strength and thermal stability, with negligible consequence on density. At the same time, nanoparticles are prone to agglomerate and this phenomenon can drastically reduce the desired beneficial effect: for this reason the ZrO 2 nanofillers were modified by several surface functionalization treatments to optimize the particles dispersion in the polymeric matrix. Materials and methods: A resole phenolic resin was selected as matrix material because of the high oxidation resistance, high heat of ablation, high char yield (55 - 60...|$|R

50|$|Early {{research}} on ablation {{technology in the}} USA was centered at NASA's Ames Research Center located at Moffett Field, California. Ames Research Center was ideal, since it had numerous wind tunnels capable of generating varying wind velocities. Initial experiments typically mounted a mock-up of the <b>ablative</b> <b>material</b> to be analyzed within a hypersonic wind tunnel. Testing of ablative materials occurs at the Ames Arc Jet Complex.

5000|$|In a basic sense, <b>ablative</b> <b>material</b> is {{designed}} to slowly burn away in a controlled manner, so that heat can be carried away from the spacecraft by the gases generated by the ablative process while the remaining solid material insulates the craft from superheated gases.

50|$|SLA in SLA-561V {{stands for}} super {{light-weight}} ablator. SLA-561V is a proprietary ablative made by Lockheed Martin {{that has been}} used as the primary TPS material on all of the 70° sphere-cone entry vehicles sent by NASA to Mars other than the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). SLA-561V begins significant ablation at a heat flux of approximately 110 W/cm², but will fail for heat fluxes greater than 300 W/cm². The MSL aeroshell TPS is currently designed to withstand a peak heat flux of 234 W/cm². The peak heat flux experienced by the Viking-1 aeroshell which landed on Mars was 21 W/cm². For Viking-1, the TPS acted as a charred thermal insulator and never experienced significant ablation. Viking-1 was the first Mars lander and based upon a very conservative design. The Viking aeroshell had a base diameter of 3.54 meters (the largest used on Mars until Mars Science Laboratory). SLA-561V is applied by packing the <b>ablative</b> <b>material</b> into a honeycomb core that is pre-bonded to the aeroshell's structure thus enabling construction of a large heat shield.|$|E
40|$|Entry Systems {{will play}} a crucial role as NASA {{develops}} the technologies required for Human Mars Exploration. The Exploration Technology Development Program Office established the Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) Technology Development Project to develop Thermal Protection System (TPS) materials for insertion into future Mars Entry Systems. An assessment of current entry system technologies identified significant opportunity to improve {{the current state of the}} art in thermal protection materials in order to enable landing of heavy mass (40 mT) payloads. To accomplish this goal, the EDL Project has outlined a framework to define, develop and model the thermal protection system material concepts required to allow for the human exploration of Mars via aerocapture followed by entry. Two primary classes of <b>ablative</b> <b>materials</b> are being developed: rigid and flexible. The rigid ablatives will be applied to the acreage of a 10 x 30 m rigid mid L/D Aeroshell to endure the dual pulse heating (peak approx. 500 W/sq cm).

5000|$|The engine uses a gas {{generator}} cycle with two independent turbopumps. The combustion chamber uses a channel-wall design to reduce cost. This design, pioneered {{in the former}} Soviet Union, features inner and outer skins brazed to middle separators, forming cooling channels. Although this method is heavier, it is much simpler and less costly than the tube-wall design (using hundreds of tubes, bent {{into the shape of}} the combustion chamber and brazed together) used in other engines. The lower nozzle has an expansion ratio of 21.5 and is lined with an <b>ablative</b> <b>material.</b> The nozzle's lining burns away as the engine runs, dissipating heat. This ablative coating is heavier than other engines' tube-wall nozzles but much easier and less expensive to manufacture. The presence of carbon in the exhaust from the ablative carbon-containing inner nozzle lining can be inferred by the yellow color of the engine exhaust, unlike the SSME's nearly-transparent flame of pure hydrogen burning. The combustion chamber burns liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen at [...] at 102% power with a 1:6 engine mixture ratio.|$|E
50|$|Heating {{caused by}} the very high reentry speeds (greater than Mach 20) is {{sufficient}} to destroy the vehicle unless special techniques are used. The early space capsules such as used on Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo were given blunt shapes to produce a stand-off bow shock. As a result most of the heat is dissipated to surrounding air without transferring through the vehicle structure. Additionally, these vehicles had <b>ablative</b> <b>material</b> that sublimates into a gas at high temperature. The act of sublimation absorbs the thermal energy from the aerodynamic heating and erodes the material away as opposed to heating the capsule. The surface of the heat shield for the Mercury spacecraft had a coating of aluminum with glassfiber in many layers. As the temperature rose to 1100 C the layers would evaporate and take the heat with it. The spacecraft would become hot but not harmfully so. The Space Shuttle used insulating tiles on its lower surface to absorb and radiate heat while preventing conduction to the aluminum airframe. The damage to the heat shield during liftoff of Space Shuttle Columbia contributed to its destruction upon reentry.|$|E
5000|$|When {{used as a}} {{component}} in fire barriers, drywall is a passive fire protection item. In its natural state, gypsum contains the water of crystallization bound {{in the form of}} hydrates. When exposed to heat or fire, this water is vaporized, over a range of temperatures from 80° to 170 °C (see calcium sulphate), retarding heat transfer until the water in the gypsum is gone. This makes drywall an <b>ablative</b> <b>material</b> because as the hydrates sublime, a crumbly dust is left behind, which, along with the paper, is sacrificial. Generally, the more layers of Type X drywall one adds, the more one increases the fire-resistance of the assembly, up to four hours for walls and three hours for ceilings. Evidence of this can be found both in publicly available design catalogues, including DIN 4102 Part 4 and the Canadian Building Code on the topic, as well as common certification listings, including certification listings provided by Underwriters Laboratories and Underwriters Laboratories of Canada (ULC). [...] "Type X" [...] drywall is formulated by adding glass fibres to the gypsum, to increase the resistance to fires, especially once the hydrates are spent, which leaves the gypsum in powder form. Type X is typically the material chosen to construct walls and ceilings that are required to have a fire-resistance rating.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. At this paper, {{the thermal}} {{behavior}} of <b>ablative</b> <b>materials</b> as heat shields for reentry vehicles is investigated numerically.

A heat flux profile from a simulated trajectory of a reentry capsule is used for investigation the performance and essential thickness of these four <b>ablative</b> <b>materials.</b> The only restriction for this simulation is the ultimate temperature of the backup structure which is beneath the ablative heat shield. At all simulations, the final thickness is defined by reaching the interface temperature, {{the temperature of the}} border between the ablative heat shield and solid shell, to 80 ± 0. 5 degrees Celsius. In addition, the sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the effect of properties variations on Carbon-Phenolic’s thickness for this specific heat flux profile...|$|R
