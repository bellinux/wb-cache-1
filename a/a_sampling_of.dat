25|$|After the leporids, {{the next}} most {{significant}} group in the diet of golden eagles is the ground squirrels. They comprise about 11.2% of the prey taken by this species across the range. In areas where leporids are scarce, this group of rodents seems to become more prominent. In {{many parts of the}} golden eagle's range, ground squirrels are rare or absent, such as the British Isles, the Iberian Peninsula and some portions of central Eurasia. Nonetheless, all of the large Spermophilus group, all species of prairie dog, all four species of antelope squirrel and all the species of marmot has been found as golden eagle prey. Nests in Denali National Park in Alaska included, among <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> 690 remains, contained 84.2% Arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii). Studies in Alaska have shown that the other major prey species in Alaska, the willow ptarmigan and the snowshoe hare, follow an 8 to 11 year population cycle. The locally abundant ground squirrels have less dramatic population variations and come out of hibernation in mid to late May (shortly after the eagles return from migration). The Alaskan Arctic ground squirrel appears to be eaten supplementally in peak years but then fill the primary niche when the ptarmigan and hare populations crash. In Alberta, Columbian ground squirrels (Spermophilus columbianus) (occasionally supplemented by other species like yellow-bellied marmots) were the primary prey species, making up 84% of the diet of eagles nesting there. In the French Alps, the most significant prey species is the Alpine marmot (Marmota marmota) at 68.9% out of <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> 198 from 6 nests. This is also the main prey species in the Italian Alps above the tree line, comprising 49.7% of a sample size of 79 from 12 nests. In the Caspian Sea area of Kazakhstan, yellow ground squirrels (Spermophilus fulvus) are the most important mammalian prey at 23.4% of <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> 468 from 36 nests. Along Coastal California, California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) replace black-tailed jackrabbits (which are scarce there) as the primary prey species. In Washington state, where the golden eagle inhabits mainly forest openings made by humans, the yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris) is the main prey species, making up 41.8% of <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> 47 from 2 nests and 40.3% of <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> 315 from 74 nests. In many other areas, ground squirrels are secondary prey, usually ranking after lagomorphs in dietary significance. This is especially true in the contiguous Western United States outside of Washington state and coastal California where they often register as second, third or even fourth most represented family by remains. Prairie dogs feature only as supplemental prey for breeding golden eagles but wintering eagles reportedly prey heavily on colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Although rare, tree squirrels have turned up as prey in some eagle nests in both North America and Eurasia.|$|E
