5|$|The <b>acute</b> <b>oral</b> <b>toxicity</b> for chromium(VI) ranges between 50 and 150µg/kg. In the body, chromium(VI) {{is reduced}} by several {{mechanisms}} to chromium(III) already in the blood before it enters the cells. The chromium(III) is excreted from the body, whereas the chromate ion is transferred into the cell by a transport mechanism, by which also sulfate and phosphate ions enter the cell. The acute toxicity of chromium(VI) is due to its strong oxidational properties. After it reaches the blood stream, it damages the kidneys, the liver and blood cells through oxidation reactions. Hemolysis, renal, and liver failure result. Aggressive dialysis can be therapeutic.|$|E

40|$|ADMET {{evaluation}} in drug discovery: 15. Accurate prediction of rat <b>oral</b> <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> using relevance vector {{machine and}} consensus modeling Tailong Lei 1, Youyong Li 3, Yunlong Song 4, Dan Li 1, Huiyong Sun 1 and Tingjun Hou 1, 2 * Background: Determination of acute toxicity, expressed as {{median lethal dose}} (LD 50), {{is one of the}} most important steps in drug discovery pipeline. Because in vivo assays for <b>oral</b> <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> in mammals are time-consuming and costly, there is thus an urgent need to develop in silico prediction models of <b>oral</b> <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity.</b> Results: In this study, based on a comprehensive data set containing 7314 diverse chemicals with rat oral LD 50 values, relevance vector machine (RVM) technique was employed to build the regression models for the prediction of <b>oral</b> <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> in rate, which were compared with those built using other six machine learning approaches, includ-ing k-nearest-neighbor regression, random forest (RF), support vector machine, local approximate Gaussian process, multilayer perceptron ensemble, and eXtreme gradient boosting. A subset of the original molecular descriptors and structural fingerprints (PubChem or SubFP) was chosen by the Chi squared statistics. The prediction capabilities of individual QSAR models, measured by q 2 ext for the test set containing 2376 molecules, ranged from 0. 572 to 0. 659. Conclusion: Considering the overall prediction accuracy for the test set, RVM with Laplacian kernel and RF were recommended to build in silico models with better predictivity for rat <b>oral</b> <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity.</b> By combining the predic-tions from individual models, four consensus models were developed, yielding better prediction capabilities for the test set (q 2 ext = 0. 669 – 0. 689). Finally, some essential descriptors and substructures relevant to <b>oral</b> <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity</b> were identified and analyzed, and they may be served as property or substructure alerts to avoid toxicity. We believe that the best consensus model with high prediction accuracy can be used as a reliable virtual screening tool to filter out compounds with high rat <b>oral</b> <b>acute</b> <b>toxicity.</b> © 2016 Lei et al.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether volumes {{based on the}} contours of the mucosal surface instead of the oral cavity can be used to predict grade ≥ 3 <b>acute</b> <b>oral</b> mucosa <b>toxicity</b> in patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LANPC) treated with concurrent intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and chemotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A standardized method for the oral cavity (oral cavity contours, OCC) and a novel method for the mucosal surface (mucosal surface contours, MSC) were developed for the oral mucosa and prospectively applied to the radiation treatment plans of 92 patients treated with concurrent IMRT and chemotherapy for LANPC. Dose–volume histogram (DVH) data were extracted and then toxicity was analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic analysis and logistic regression were carried out for both contouring methods. RESULTS: Grade ≥ 3 <b>acute</b> <b>oral</b> mucosa <b>toxicity</b> occurred to 20. 7 % (19 / 92) of patients in the study. A highly significant dose–volume relationship between oral mucosa irradiation and <b>acute</b> <b>oral</b> mucosa <b>toxicity</b> was supported by using both oral cavity and mucosal surface contouring techniques. In logistic regression, body weight loss was an independent factor related to grade ≥ 3 acute toxicity for OCC and MSC (P = . 017 and 0. 005, respectively), and the independent factor of dosimetric parameters for OCC and MSC were V 30 Gy (P = . 003) and V 50 Gy (P = . 003) respectively. In the receiver operating characteristics curve, the areas under V 30 Gy of the OCC curves was 0. 753 (P = . 001), while the areas under V 50 Gy of MSC curves was 0. 714 (P = . 004); the cut-off value was 73. 155 % (sensitivity, 0. 842; specificity, 0. 671) and 14. 32 % (sensitivity, 0. 842; specificity, 0. 575), respectively.
