5|$|Late in his life, {{from the}} {{electric}} period on, Davis repeatedly disregarded his earlier work, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> of Birth of the Cool or Kind of Blue. In Davis' view, remaining static stylistically {{was the wrong}} option.|$|E
5|$|According to {{writer and}} film {{director}} Jukka Virtanen, Vainio usually wrote his lyrics {{at the same}} time <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>music.</b> This is evident in the song Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä, written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who never got to dance at his own wedding. Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace, songs were never easy for him to write. His work did not become easier when he quit drinking, but it did become more emotional.|$|E

5000|$|... "Jewelled" [...] {{was used}} for many years <b>as</b> <b>the</b> theme <b>music</b> for <b>the</b> BBC's Lombard/RAC Rally {{coverage}}.

5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was released on July 29, 2015 through the official Japanese Warner Bros. channel on YouTube. It opens with a blurred long shot of the band sitting on a couch, and <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> starts, it has them performing in a warehouse surrounded with music gear and ornaments. Intercut shots of vocalist Ichigo surrounded with construction tape appears during the songs verses, whilst Kyoudan is seen performing the guitar during instrumental breaks on a tank. The video ends with a long shot of the group standing in the warehouse.|$|E
5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} on 1 June 1727 in the Nikolaikirche. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that a printed libretto for the congregation was recently {{found in the}} Russian National Library in St. Petersburg, containing the texts for the three feast days of Pentecost and Trinity of 1727. Until then the work had been dated much later, such as 1746 when a revival took place for which performance material exists. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> of the 1727 version is lost, the timing of Bach's revisions to the wedding cantata is not known. It is likely that he revised it further in the 1740s because he wrote a new score.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{having been}} a public intellectual, Edward Said was an {{accomplished}} pianist, worked <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> critic for The Nation magazine, and wrote four books about music: Musical Elaborations (1991); Parallels and Paradoxes: Explorations in Music and Society (2002), with Daniel Barenboim as co-author; On Late Style: Music and Literature Against the Grain (2006); and Music at the Limits (2007) in which final tome he spoke of finding musical reflections of his literary and historical ideas in bold compositions and strong performances.|$|E

5|$|Charles III {{also made}} serious {{attempts}} to find the various works of art and furniture looted, sold and dispersed during the revolution. Together with new purchases, a fine art collection once again adorned the palace which included not only family portraits {{such as that of}} Lucien I by de Predis; Honoré II by Philippe de Champaigne; the head of Antoine I by Hyacinthe Rigaud, and van Loo's portrait of Louise-Hyppolyte (Illustration 11) but also such masterpieces <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Music</b> Lesson by Titian.|$|E
5|$|Daltrey, {{who was in}} {{the year}} above, had moved to Acton from Shepherd's Bush, a more working-class area. He had trouble fitting in at the school, and {{discovered}} gangs and rock and roll. He was expelled at 15 and found work on a building site. In 1959 he started the Detours, the band that was to evolve into the Who. The band played professional gigs, such as corporate and wedding functions, and Daltrey kept a close eye on the finances as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, calypso and {{steelband}} music {{became very}} popular and indeed replaced lapo kabwit and chanté mas <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> of carnival, {{particularly in the}} capital Roseau. Many of the traditional songs were performed in the new calypso beat. Calypsonians and Calypso Monarch competitions emerged and became extremely popular. Steelbands emerged all around the country. The older musicians and bands had moved on and were replaced by the younger musicians. Bands such as Swinging Stars, The Gaylords, De Boys an Dem, Los Caballeros and Swinging Busters surfaced and began to cut records. The emergence of radio, first WIDBS and later Radio Dominica helped to spread the music.|$|E

5|$|The 10-minute {{murder scene}} which forms the film's climax is scored with almost {{the whole of}} the Act II duet between Otello and Iago from Giuseppe Verdi's Otello. This is an {{atypical}} scoring for a film, since Verdi's piece is not an aria, but a dramatic dialogue in which the words are as important <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>music.</b> Thus the astute spectator will be presented with two dramatic narratives to follow; Allen is not respecting traditional conventions of cinematic accompaniment, since the score's events do not match the story unfolding onscreen.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Soma Bringer was {{composed}} and arranged by Yasunori Mitsuda, whose previous notable work included titles such as Chrono Trigger, Xenogears, Chrono Cross, and Xenosaga Episode I. Mitsuda was involved {{from the very}} beginning of development, as Takahashi did not want to work on a game without Mitsuda's music. Mitsuda accepted due to their past work on Xenogears and Xenosaga, considering it a kind of reunion. Mitsuda's music formed a key part in compensating for the lack of proper cutscenes, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> made up for any lack in dramatic character movement during story sequences.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} premiered on 8 November 2011 on YouTube, and {{predominantly}} depicts the group spending {{time on the}} banks of Lake Placid. As of February 2016, the music video has garnered more than 180 million Vevo views. In the music video, the five-some end up meeting with girls in a camping spot in a forest. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> ends, the group watch fireworks as Malik walks towards his significant other and kisses her. The clip attracted positive commentary from fans of the group.|$|E

5|$|The track lengths for {{a number}} of tracks on all three discs are {{different}} than the Original Sound Version release. On the first disc, tracks 24-27 are new arranged version tracks that were included <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> from those tracks corresponded to the video animated sequences that were added originally on the PlayStation version. The same applied to tracks 25-27 on the second disc and tracks 18-24 on the third disc.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a shot {{of a little girl}} {{sleeping}} in her bed. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> starts, rays of light emanate from the bedside radio with cartoon violins playing the music. The sun rises inside a picture on the wall and the girl wakes and starts playing with her doll. A fairy goes around tapping all her toys on the floor and a large, golden teapot comes alive and shoots a rainbow from its spout. A cartoon version of the girl then slides along the rainbow and, interpreting the lyrics of the song, catches a falling star and rides over the moon.|$|E
5|$|This changed {{dramatically}} in the 2000s (decade), when the University started a campaign to {{increase the size of}} the endowment. At the close of fiscal year 2004–2005, the endowment had risen to $1.325 billion, raising the University to sixth of the 11 Big Ten schools in terms of endowment; within $2 million of the fifth-rated school. The rapid increase {{in the size of the}} endowment will help to improve outdated facilities, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Music</b> Building, which the College of Music hopes to soon replace with money from its alumni fundraising program.|$|E

50|$|There {{has been}} {{repeated}} use (and sometimes parody) {{of parts of}} this overture in both classical music and popular media, most famously <b>as</b> <b>the</b> theme <b>music</b> for <b>The</b> Lone Ranger in radio, television and film.

5|$|As in an oratorio, {{the written}} text in a choral symphony {{can be as}} {{important}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>music,</b> and the chorus and soloists can participate equally with the instruments in the exposition and development of musical ideas. The text can also help determine whether the composer follows symphonic form strictly, {{as in the case}} of Rachmaninoff, Britten and Shostakovich, or whether they expand symphonic form, {{as in the case of}} Berlioz, Mahler and Havergal Brian. Sometimes the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian. The composer can also choose to treat the text fluidly, in a manner more like music than narrative. Such was the case with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero II {{features}} many popular {{real world}} Gibson, Epiphone, and Kramer guitars, including the Gibson Les Paul, Gibson SG, Gibson Flying V, (these three {{being the only}} ones available from the start) Gibson Sonex 180 and Gibson Explorer. Oddities such as the double necked Gibson EDS-1275 and unusual looking Gibson Corvus also make an appearance. Several available finishes are also recognizable from popular guitarists, including Zakk Wylde's bullseye Les Paul. As play progresses, several custom shaped guitars become available, although some are notable {{in the real world}} such as the USA and Battle Axe (a similar looking bass is played by Gene Simmons, and the guitar was played by John Christ of Samhain/Danzig fame). Basses, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Music</b> Man StingRay, Gibson Thunderbird, and the Höfner bass (as made famous by Paul McCartney, the bassist for the Beatles) are also available for co-op play.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{he served}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> {{director}} for Gulzar's Maachis (1996), {{for which he}} received the Filmfare RD Burman Award for New Music Talent. The film depicted the transformation of boys into terrorists during the Punjab insurgency in Punjab in the 1980s. The soundtrack composed by Bhardwaj became an anthem for the politically restive college youth at that time. He later collaborated with him on TV serials such as Alice in Wonderland and Gubbare. His further projects included Betaabi (1997), Tunnu Ki Tina (1997), Satya (1998) and Hu Tu Tu (1999). At the 46th National Film Awards, Bhardwaj received the National Film Award for Best Music Direction for his critically acclaimed score in Godmother (1999). In 2010, he composed the music for his production venture Ishqiya, which garnered him his second National Film Award for Best Music Direction. He also composed music for Jungle Book Shōnen Mowgli, the Hindi dubbed version of the anime adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's original collection of stories, The Jungle Book. Apart from feature films, Bhardwaj has provided music for music albums such as: Sunset Point (2000), Ishqa Ishqa (2002) and Barse Barse (2011). He frequently collaborates with Gulzar.|$|E
