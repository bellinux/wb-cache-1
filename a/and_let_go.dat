5|$|Lavigne {{released}} Let Go in June 2002 in the US, {{where it}} reached number {{two on the}} Billboard 200 albums chart. It peaked at number one in Australia, Canada, and the UK—this made Lavigne, at 17 years old, the youngest female soloist to have a number-one album on the UK Albums Chart at that time. By the end of 2002, the album was certified four-times Platinum by the RIAA, making her the bestselling female artist of 2002 <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> <b>Go</b> the top-selling debut of the year. By May 2003, Let Go had accumulated over 1 million sales in Canada, receiving a diamond certification from the Canadian Recording Industry Association. By 2009, the album had sold over 16 million units worldwide, and the RIAA certified the album six-times Platinum, denoting shipments of over six million units in the US (it has sold 6.8million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan).|$|E
5|$|In July 1999, Nader {{was let go}} from All My Children due to {{budgetary}} considerations, however, {{he later}} returned in May 2000. The following year, the actor's arrest brought him and the character {{to the center of}} a large fan campaign organized by a group called the Loyalists, as well as a highly publicized lawsuit catching the attention of People and Entertainment Tonight, among other media outlets. As a result, Nader was let go again by the soap opera, with an official statement saying they would be prepared to consider having him return once he had addressed the lawsuit issues. The role was temporarily recast with actor Anthony Addabbo, who was negatively received by viewers, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> shortly after his debut. Nader later stated in an interview that ABC had informed him that they had no intention of ever bringing him or the character back {{due to a lack of}} storyline. In 2004, Nader's suit was subsequently thrown out. In May 2013, after a twelve-year absence from All My Children, Nader was announced to be reprising the role, with his return airing on June 12, 2013.|$|E

25|$|The {{remaining}} four designers {{were each}} assigned {{one of the}} four basic elements. Matt was assigned water, Andrea received earth, Carissa was given air, and Goil was given fire. Utilizing the assigned themes, the designers were given three days to design a luxury hotel suite.

25|$|One of {{the most}} common effectors is the gripper. In its {{simplest}} manifestation, it consists of just two fingers which can open and close to pick up <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> of a range of small objects. Fingers can for example, be made of a chain with a metal wire run through it. Hands that resemble and work more like a human hand include the Shadow Hand and the Robonaut hand. Hands that are of a mid-level complexity include the Delft hand. Mechanical grippers can come in various types, including friction and encompassing jaws. Friction jaws use all the force of the gripper to hold the object in place using friction. Encompassing jaws cradle the object in place, using less friction.|$|E
25|$|Raguet {{became the}} first chargé d'affaires from the United States to Brazil on October 29, 1825. One of the first issues he dealt with was the {{blockade}} of Argentine ports by the Brazilian navy during the Cisplatine War. Argentina was a growing trade partner of the United States and Raguet and his counterpart in Argentina worked to convince Brazil to restrict its blockade to only certain ports and that ships approaching the blockade should be given warning before being seized by Brazil. After negotiations, Brazil restricted its blockade to only ports in the Río de la Plata, but the blockade still encompassed more ports than the United States was pressing for. Brazil never made it a policy to give ships warning, but many ships were warned <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>go.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Chicago Cubs {{franchise}} {{began as}} the Chicago White Stockings in 1876, with Albert Spalding as the franchise's inaugural manager. The team's second manager, Cap Anson, set team records in games managed (2,194), seasons managed (18), and wins (1,242). Frank Chance, {{part of the}} famous Tinker to Evers to Chance double-play combination—all of whom managed the franchise at some point—has the best winning percentage in club history (.664), led the Cubs franchise to World Series victories in 1907 and 1908.

Lou Piniella managed the Cubs from 2007–2010 and led the team to consecutive postseason appearances in 2007 and 2008, becoming the first manager to lead the team to multiple postseasons since Charlie Grimm's four appearances from 1932–1935.

2500|$|Originally {{there was}} no {{distinction}} between an awarded or scrum and a loose scrum (today known as a ruck). The side awarded the scrum had one player put {{the ball on the}} ground <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> of it; {{there was no}} requirement of a tunnel. The onside line was dictated by the ball; so players were required to remain behind it. A scrum would most commonly be awarded when a stalemate occurred between the player with the ball, who would declare [...] "held", and opposition holding him, who would call [...] "Have it down". The early rules did not draw a clear distinction between players in or out of a scrum, and did not require players in the scrum to bind. The early rules of rugby, even after re-codification as [...] "Laws of the Rugby Union", said the object of players in the scrum was to kick the ball towards their opponents' goal line. This provision remained in the laws for approximately 20 years after practice had changed in the late 19th century.|$|E

2500|$|The four-cd box set {{compilation}} received {{critical acclaim}} upon its release. The Times wrote in its review of Downside Up: [...] "Standouts include the spiky Drop Dead/Celebration, the sinister Eve White/Eve Black and the chopped up industrial funk of Tattoo". The critic also rated the band {{as one of}} [...] "the most audacious and uncompromising musical adventurers of the post-punk era." [...] Stylus rated it A saying : [...] "It’s a wonderfully eclectic mixture of fingers-down-a-blackboard avant-punk (“Voices (On The Air),” “Eve White/Eve Black”), Creatures-esque tribal drum-worship (“Sunless”), majestic beauty (“Something Blue,” “Shooting Sun,” “Return”), amusing experimentation (“Slap Dash Snap,” “(There’s A) Planet In My Kitchen”), linguistic fun (“Mittageisen,” “Il Est Ne, Le Divin Enfant,” “El Dia De Los Muertos”) and, yes, playfully ‘dark’ tunes (“Something Wicked (This Way Comes),” “Are You Still Dying, Darling?”)." [...] Record Collector praised the box set for its [...] "remarkable diversity, spontaneity and playfulness", considering that there are [...] "No throwaway tracks". Critic Murray Chalmers noted: [...] ""Drop Dead/Celebration" [...] is still a wonderful explosion of bile aimed at their absconded guitarist and drummer, while Slap Dash Snap is prototype techno." [...] She underlined {{the diversity of the}} material: [...] "on more reflective tracks like Sea Of Light <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> <b>Go</b> you feel that here is a group who could go anywhere". She then stated: [...] "By CD2 they are firing on all cylinders, a pop group thrillingly ahead of the pack, CD3 is immaculate." [...] and considered the four tracks of The Thorn that end the box set as an [...] "orchestrated EP of ferocious intensity". Rock Sound shared a similar point of view and said: [...] "Whilst most bands regard the B-side as an irrelevancy, a dumping ground for throwaway tracks not deemed good enough for proper release, Siouxsie And The Banshees always treated it with respect, an excuse to have fun and experiment." [...] Neil Gardner praised [...] "the sensual menace of [...] "Tattoo"". Uncut qualified Downside Up as [...] "an exhaustive and fascinating collection from an astonishing group".|$|E
