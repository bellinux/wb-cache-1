5|$|In August 1900, the {{commander}} of German forces at Victoria (present-day Limbe) appointed Atangana interpreter for 500 Bulu hostages, who were being pressed into labour. Atangana kept the post {{for six months and}} took up extra duties as a nurse. The colonisers next sent Atangana to Buea to work as an office clerk. At some point between the end of his schooling in Kribi and the end of his service in Victoria, Atangana met Marie Biloa, a woman from a village called Mekumba. Although she was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>older</b> and living as a kept woman by a German functionary, Atangana married her. She would eventually bear him two children: Jean Ndengue and Katerina (or Catherine) Edzimbi.|$|E

It is from an older part of the Morrison Formation, and so <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>older</b> than other Morrison stegosaurs. Several {{relatively}} complete skeletons of Hesperosaurus are known. One specimen preserves the first known impression of the horn sheath of a stegosaurian back plate.|$|E

Whatever the case these {{so-called}} golden eras weren’t only defined by the music or the fashion - they were characterised by something less tangible - an atmosphere, a movement.|$|E

25|$|Acting Dean Greenough was to {{head the}} Court. Another senior member was Professor of Hygiene Robert I. Lee, the doctor {{responsible}} for the students' annual physical examinations, who had experience posing intimate questions about sexual activity. A third was Regent Matthew Luce, whose responsibilities included student discipline and conduct, especially housing and dormitory proctors. They were all roughly forty years old or more. Two young Assistant Deans, Edward R. Gay and Kenneth Murdock, both just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>older</b> than the undergraduates, filled out the Court's membership. The Court reported to President Lowell, and his rulings were final.|$|E

I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>older,</b> more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E
25|$|Plants are {{referred}} to as annuals which live only one year, biennials which live two years, and perennials which live longer than that. The longest-lived perennials, woody-stemmed plants such as trees and bushes, often live for hundreds and even thousands of years (one may question whether or not they may die of old age). A giant sequoia, General Sherman {{is alive and well in}} its third millennium. A Great Basin Bristlecone Pine called Methuselah is 4,848 years old (as of 2017) and the Bristlecone Pine called Prometheus was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>older</b> still, at least 4,844 years (and possibly as old as 5,000 years), when it was cut down in 1964. The oldest known plant (possibly oldest living thing) is a clonal Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) tree colony in the Fishlake National Forest in Utah called Pando at about 80,000 years. Lichen, a symbiotic algae and fungal proto-plant, such as Rhizocarpon geographicum can live upwards of 10,000 years.|$|E

25|$|Reproducing 13 {{watercolour}} and graphite drawings, Bluff Life (1990) {{was produced}} in 1982 during a two-month stay in a lighthouse off the southern coast of Iceland in a town called Dyrhólaey. The series totals of thirteen drawings, all made on note cards. The second book, Folds (1991), {{is a collection of}} photographs documenting extent sheepfolds; a unique indigenous structure found throughout the island. To Place: Verne’s Journey (1995), the fifth in the series, refers to the North Atlantic island where the book Journey to Center of The Earth (1864), by Jules Verne, began. Horn’s volume opens with a series of aerial geographic views of Iceland, continues with multiple images of the island’s geological formations, and concludes with images of crashing waves. A photographic essay, the seventh volume Arctic Circles (1998) records the endless horizon of the North Sea, the feathers of an eider nest, and the rotating beacon of a lighthouse, invoking in form the very circumference of Iceland. Doubt Box (Book IX) (2006) is a collection of cards rather than a bound volume. Printed on both sides, the cards show pictures of glacial water, taxidermied birds, and of the same face, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>older.</b>|$|E

500|$|Announcement of Jessie Bannon's {{inclusion}} caused backlash among Quest fans. TV Guides editors {{feared that}} Jonny and Jessie would become romantically entangled, declaring her an [...] "icky female". H-B Chief Fred Seibert responded, [...] "Jessie is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>older</b> and smarter than Jonny... We're not doing Moonlighting here." [...] Seibert also denied that Jessie {{had been created}} solely to appeal to little girls, citing extant support for Jonny and the classic team. A Miami Herald columnist called Jessie an [...] "effort to rewrite the past {{to conform to the}} sociopolitical mandates of the present" [...] and political correctness [...] "run amok". Billboard conversely welcomed the change over an all-male cast. The fiasco subsided after the Cyber Insects telefilm aired; the Atlanta Journal-Constitution rebuffed the [...] "icky girl" [...] label, as Jessie saved Jonny's life and taught him patience. A test screening of Cyber Insects to [...] males revealed that though some questioned her addition, most understood that like certain elements criticized in the original series, it was a reflection of the times.|$|E

500|$|Although Spiritual Machines {{was not as}} {{successful}} as Our Lady Peace's previous three albums, it was highly praised by fans and critics alike as being one of Our Lady Peace's finest releases, and has also been proclaimed as being the height of their artistic creativity. Selena Gomez of the University Star of Texas State University–San Marcos called the album incredible, but {{also pointed out that}} it was a commercial disaster due to it being [...] "flighty and difficult to palate." [...] MacKenzie Wilson of Allmusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars saying that [...] "They can still deliver pinch-hitting licks and the brash attitude they did when they first formed in 1993, but they are <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>older</b> and a little wiser." [...] A review from the Hamilton Spectator noted that the album's concluding tracks [...] "If You Believe" [...] and [...] "The Wonderful Future" [...] demonstrated a particular facility for mixing sonic textures and that there were [...] "actually moments when vocalist Raine Maida varies from his impersonation of a singing head cold." [...] Ashley Bird of Kerrang! noted that the album was packed with crisp, clean songwriting, odd searing post-grunge riffs and Raine Maida's nasal croon. He {{went on to say that}} the song [...] "Life" [...] "is one of the most perfectly weighted slices of pop-rock you'll hear." ...|$|E
500|$|For the {{majority}} of the recordings, Saadiq played most of the instruments, including bass, keyboard, guitar, Mellotron, percussion, and drums, and he also layered each recorded instrumental part afterwards. Brungardt used a Neumann U 47 microphone to record each of Saadiq's instrument parts. Saadiq recorded his vocals on a dynamic microphone alone in the recording studio's control room, an approach encouraged to him earlier in his career by record producer and audio engineer Gerry Brown. According to Brungardt, [...] " [...] voice benefits from a dynamic mic because it tends to give him more bottom and presence. Plus dynamic mics can sound <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>older</b> when pushed". With the songs' guitar parts, Brungardt wanted to create additional distortion in order to produce a grittier guitar sound for the songs, a stylistic preference Saadiq and he had acquired from listening to a great deal of indie rock at the time. He applied several techniques to achieve this sound, including increasing the gain on Saadiq's Fender Twin guitar amplifier, using a software plug-in for the recordings in post-production, and re-amping Saadiq's guitar parts. In his interview for EQ Magazine, Brungardt discussed using a Massey TapeHead, one of his preferred plug-ins, in the recording process, stating [...] "I’ll use that {{on a lot of things}} to get a little more grit. It thickens stuff up nicely if you record something that’s a little too bright. I usually go a lot for darker tones when recording and mixing".|$|E

[...] Whedon explained, [...] "We wanted a much darker show, darker in tone. It's set in Los Angeles {{because there are a}} lot of demons in L.A. and a wealth of stories to be told. We also wanted to take the show <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>older</b> and have the characters deal with demons in a much different way.

2500|$|While the Sega Saturn was marketed towards 18 to 34 year-olds, the PlayStation was marketed roughly, but not exclusively, towards 12 to 24 year-olds. Both Sega and Sony {{reasoned}} that because younger players typically {{look up to}} older, more experienced players, they would be drawn in by advertising targeted at teens and adults. [...] Additionally, Sony found that adults are best targeted by advertising geared towards teenagers; according to Lee Clow, [...] "One {{of the first things}} we resolved early on was that everyone is 17 when they play videogames. The young people look up to the best gamer who is usually <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>older</b> and more practiced and talented. Then there are people who start working and grow up, but when they go into their room and sit down with their videogames, they're regressing and becoming 17 again."
