500|$|After {{examining}} {{the designs of}} both parties, Linderman ordered that the design would depict a seated figure representing Liberty facing to the viewer's left, representing {{the direction of the}} Orient. Linderman apparently selected the designs from two different patterns. In June 1873, Linderman reviewed the various patterns created by Barber; he chose an obverse which one contemporary reporter described as [...] "a female figure seated on bales of merchandise, holding in her left hand a scroll bearing the word 'Liberty'. <b>At</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> is a sheaf of wheat, expressing, with the bales of goods, the commercial character of the coin: the right hand extended holds the olive branch." [...] The selected reverse depicts the bald eagle as required by law. The eagle has three arrows in the right claw and an olive branch in the left, a reversal to most other U.S. silver coins of the era. A set of six patterns, four with variations on the adopted obverse, and two showing portraits of Liberty, was sold by the Mint to the public in limited quantities.|$|E

60|$|Arnold glanced <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{deliberately}} and <b>back</b> {{again at}} his hostess.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned away}} to the mantelpiece, and stood gazing <b>at</b> the photograph, <b>her</b> <b>back</b> towards him.|$|R
60|$|Very disposedly we paraded {{the length}} of the walk and <b>at</b> <b>her</b> request <b>backed</b> again. This time the child had got the better of his panic, but stood far off and doubting.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Jarvis {{thought of}} Paris. <b>At</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> {{the window was}} open, for it was a mild night; a calm night; when the moon seemed muffled and the apple trees stood {{perfectly}} still.|$|E
60|$|He {{perceived}} {{that his wife}} had sat up. Mrs Verloc’s arms remained lying stretched on the table. Mr Verloc watched <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> as if he could read there the effect of his words.|$|E
60|$|As I stood {{talking with}} the girl I {{presently}} recollected that she still was bound, and with a word of apology, I drew my knife and cut the rawhide thongs which confined her wrists <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mamie {{entered the}} house without speaking. It seemed to Steve that invective {{would have been better}} than this ominous silence. He looked ruefully <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{retreating}} <b>back</b> and turned to greet Kirk.|$|R
25|$|The ship {{remains a}} wreck <b>at</b> Costinești. <b>Her</b> <b>back</b> is broken, and two {{large areas of}} plates are missing from her {{starboard}} side. Costinești is a small seaside resort, for which the wreck is a local attraction.|$|R
60|$|ELLIE [turning <b>at</b> bay with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> to the carpenter's bench, scornfully self-possessed]. It was not thrown away. He {{believes}} it. I {{should not}} have believed it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I never {{pity the}} dead," [...] said Mrs. Jarvis, {{shifting}} the cushion <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> and clasping her hands behind her head. Betty Flanders did not hear, for her scissors {{made so much}} noise on the table.|$|E
60|$|Thus admonished, Baptista {{entered the}} house, {{her father and}} Mr. Heddegan {{immediately}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>back.</b> Her mother had been so didactic that she had felt herself absolutely unable to broach {{the subjects in the}} centre of her mind.|$|E
6000|$|Moreover {{she thought}} of the laughter, the shrug, the jibe That would rise <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> in the nave when she should pass As another's avowed by the words she had chosen to inscribe [...] On the changeless brass.|$|E
60|$|PROSERPINE. (testily, {{crossing}} {{to the fire}} and standing <b>at</b> it with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> to him). Oh, don't be frightened: it's not you. It's not any one particular person.|$|R
60|$|Very good, {{she was the}} enemy, very good. As he prowled round her, {{she watched}} him. As he struck <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> she struck <b>back.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "Here's Rajah Hassim coming, Jorgenson. I {{had an idea}} {{he would}} perhaps stay outside." [...] Mrs. Travers heard Lingard's voice <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> and the {{answering}} grunt of Jorgenson. She raised deliberately the long glass to her eye, pointing it at the shore.|$|E
60|$|He served her, and {{standing}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> bent {{now and then}} to speak, still with that softened look upon the face so seldom stirred by the gentler emotions that lay far down in that deep heart of his; for never had he felt so solitary.|$|E
60|$|Entering, the Bible-nurse {{whispered to}} this man. Another moment and Mrs Frog was {{seated at a}} long deal table with a {{comfortable}} fire <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> a basin of warm soup, and a lump of loaf bread before her. The Bible-nurse sat by and looked on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you in pain, mamma? Will you {{lie down}} on the bed?" [...] Her mother only looked <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> She drew <b>back</b> trembling, and said no more.|$|R
6000|$|I {{stopped and}} looked up <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> She started <b>back</b> from me with a scream of terror. I looked down again at the title-page, and read the next lines-- ...|$|R
60|$|Jim {{turned to}} follow in the {{direction}} indicated, when, behold, there stood <b>at</b> his <b>back</b> <b>her</b> father, Dairyman Tucker.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Battersby's only a boy. After all, Letty, I don't {{know whether}} I like {{officers}} {{so much better}} than other men,"--and she twisted her neck round to get a look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> in the pier-glass, and gave her dress a little pull just above her bustle.|$|E
60|$|The noise {{had brought}} Dejah Thoris {{to the door}} of her apartment, and there she stood {{throughout}} the conflict with Sola <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> peering over her shoulder. Her face was set and emotionless and I knew that she did not recognize me, nor did Sola.|$|E
60|$|I {{snatched}} my advantage. Right <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> {{there was}} pen, ink, and paper laid out. I wrote: ‘I love you’; and before I {{had time to}} write more, or so much as to blot what I had written, I was again under the guns of the gold eyeglasses.|$|E
60|$|He looked still <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> holding <b>back</b> {{behind his}} look his discontent. Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. I'm hungry too. Flakes of pastry on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour {{stuck to her}} cheek. Rhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior. Josie Powell that was. In Luke Doyle's long ago. Dolphin's Barn, the charades. U.P.: up.|$|R
50|$|Tia clicks some {{pictures}} of Ranvir and Vrinda to prove to Pri that he laughs <b>at</b> <b>her</b> behind <b>her</b> <b>back.</b> But it backfires on her as it comes out in the bulletin and Pri is hurt. Tia too starts realising her feelings towards Ranvir which later on ends up in a budding romance between Tia-Ranveer.|$|R
60|$|His lordship {{closed the}} door with care. Hortensia took her seat upon the long stool that stood <b>at</b> the spinet, <b>her</b> <b>back</b> to the instrument, and with hands idle in her lap--the same cold reserve upon her countenance-she awaited his communication.|$|R
60|$|As she lay {{tormented by}} these frightful thoughts, she {{suddenly}} became conscious that the bonds at her wrists and ankles no longer hurt her, {{and then of}} the fact that her hands were separated, one lying upon either side of her, instead of both being confined <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
6000|$|I {{snatched}} my advantage. Right <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> {{there was}} pen, ink, and paper laid out. I wrote: [...] "I love you"; and before I {{had time to}} write more, or so much as to blot what I had written, I was again under the guns of the gold eye-glasses.|$|E
60|$|The Lady Rowena, {{with three}} of her attendants {{standing}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> and arranging her hair ere she lay down to rest, was seated {{in the sort of}} throne already mentioned, and looked as if born to exact general homage. The Pilgrim acknowledged her claim to it by a low genuflection.|$|E
60|$|The unimaginative {{nature of}} Fulham {{did not allow}} the Fulham mind to gather in the fact that, at the same time, she might possess two or three such hats. But they were {{undoubtedly}} precisely similar, and she would wear them in London with exactly the same indifference as in the comparatively rural neighborhood of her own residence. She would, in truth, {{go up and down}} in the omnibus, and would do so alone, without the slightest regard to the opinion of any of her neighbors. The Carroll girls would laugh <b>at</b> <b>her</b> behind <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> but no Carroll girl had been seen ever to smile before her face, instigated to do so by their cousin's vagaries.|$|R
60|$|Lit-lit nodded; for to disobey {{her father}} was a peril she knew well; and, furthermore, it was a little thing he asked, a short {{separation}} from the Factor, who would know only greater gladness <b>at</b> having <b>her</b> <b>back.</b> She returned to the feast, and, midnight being well at hand, the Factor sought her out and led her away to the Fort amid joking and outcry, in which the squaws were especially conspicuous.|$|R
60|$|Menelek, <b>at</b> <b>her</b> words, leaned <b>back</b> in {{his throne}} and laughed uproariously. Following his example, which seemed always the correct procedure, the {{assembled}} guests vied {{with one another}} in an effort to laugh more noisily than the emperor.|$|R
