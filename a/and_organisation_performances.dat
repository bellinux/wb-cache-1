40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{investigating}} {{the relationship between}} improvements in information quality and the benefits <b>and</b> <b>performance</b> of e-Government <b>organisations.</b> As information quality is a multidimensional measure, it is very crucial to determine what aspects of it are critical to organisations to help them to devise effective information quality improvement strategies. These strategies are potentially capable of changing government organisational structures and business processes. To develop effective information quality improvement strategies, {{it is important to}} explore the relationships between information quality (‘cause’) and organisational benefits and performance (‘effect’). The limited research on information quality <b>and</b> <b>organisations</b> <b>performance</b> focuses on private sectors and pays little attention to governments <b>and</b> public <b>organisations.</b> To the best of the author’s knowledge, there is no single study which covers the relationships between information quality <b>and</b> <b>organisations</b> <b>performance</b> in Kuwait.

40|$|Employees {{are often}} {{encouraged}} to take on {{more control over their}} work practices, so as to generate “more for less” solutions to the benefit of their employers, clients and themselves. To employees such increased control – or empowerment – generates ambiguities: Unprecedented opportunities to create fulfilling jobs are accompanied by unprecedented complexity, competence demands, and responsibilities for outcomes of work practices. The research issue highlighted in this thesis is how employee empowerment processes can be made conducive to both employee health <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>performance.</b> This constructive issue is examined using data from a tailor-made approach to organisation learning, carried out in a municipal Department of Adolescent Services (DOAS) in Norway. DOAS collaborated with Centre for Health Promotion in Settings (CHPS) on developing the tailor-made approach. CHPS assumed that employees by improving their generalist competencies (for instance in decision making, interdisciplinary collaboration, <b>organisation</b> learning, <b>and</b> project work), in combination with conducting action research on own work practices, could increase their control over work practices in ways conducive to both employee health <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>performance.</b> It was also assumed that collaboration between employees at various levels and units in the work organisation was crucial for such a development, and that increased control had to transcend the level of daily work practices and include the levels of prioritising (deciding on objectives), and organising (deciding on how to divide tasks between employees). The tailor-made approach (TMA) in DOAS combined a 15 ECTS course in “Interdisciplinary collaboration in practice” and six “workplace development projects” (WDPs), tailored to DOAS’ vision of employee empowerment, and to DOAS’ self-defined needs for competence and workplace development. CHPS had primary responsibility for the course, whereas DOAS had primary responsibility for the WDPs. These two components were intended to support generation of knowledge in the intersections between work and education. The employees recruited to the TMA had little or no prior knowledge of each other. They were divided between the six WDP-groups, which had wide decision making latitude. When the TMA ended after approximately 10 months in December 2000 the WDP-groups had strengthened their capacities for organisation learning, but had not succeeded in sustaining empowerment processes or in improving both employee health <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>performance.</b> Three likely explanations as to why not were identified: 1) employees’ previous experiences with change initiatives in the work organisation, 2) shortcomings in the TMA-framework (group compositions, supervision, feedback from managers), and 3) employees’ competencies in decision making and workplace development. However, in parallel with the WDP-groups’ activities the top-management group (TMG) in DOAS took a number of initiatives facilitating increased employee control over ongoing work practices, both concerning priorities, <b>organisation</b> <b>and</b> daily work practices. These initiatives were followed up on and expanded by the TMG in the aftermath of DOAS’ collaboration with CHPS. When comparing DOAS of 1999 with DOAS of 2004 - 05 several changes could be identified. For instance, employees were participating much more actively in deciding upon priorities, there had been a series of incremental changes in DOAS’ formal organisation consistent with the objectives, there was a much higher level of trust across layers and units in the <b>organisation,</b> <b>and</b> the mandates for most middle-management positions had been altered so as to strengthen continuous workplace development. DOAS had succeeded in increasing employee control over a broad spectrum of work practices, and although the data on consequences thereof are somewhat scarce they most likely did so in ways strengthening both employee health <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>performance.</b> The activities initiated by DOAS itself proved to be more important to these developments than the course and other activities initiated by CHPS, but the developments in DOAS were still highly influenced by the CHPS’ perspectives and suggested approaches. The dynamic between the two <b>organisations</b> <b>and</b> the interplay between work and education was characterised by “CHPS suggested, DOAS decided”. The research documented in this thesis is based on data from an action research approach. The ambition was to generate knowledge that could be useful in work organisations facing similar challenges as the Department of Adolescent Services, and useful to disciplines engaged in the intersections between health <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>performance</b> in general, <b>and</b> (employee) empowerment in particular. It is argued that action research can be particularly relevant to develop knowledge about social change processes, and that action research can be compatible with generally accepted norms for how social science is to be carried out. The tailor-made approach documented and analysed in this thesis is suggested {{as an example of a}} settings approach to workplace health promotion. It combines perspectives on empowerment from the disciplines of health promotion and human resources. It highlights employee health <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>performance</b> as intertwined dimensions in work practice. It emphasises how employees themselves can transform stressful challenges into work practice that is coherent to them, and productive to stakeholders like owners and clients. The employee empowerment process is here analysed as comprised of three sub-processes; one characterised by exploration of scope for self-determination and decision making, one characterised by trial and error in developing new work practice, and one characterised by sustaining new work practice. Data support the assumptions that such processes are strengthened by collaboration across layers and units in the <b>organisation,</b> <b>and</b> strengthened by addressing both priorities, <b>organisation</b> <b>and</b> daily work practices. A vocabulary for organisation learning centred on these three levels proved to be highly useful in this case, as did a toolbox-perspective which provided employees with various theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches they could use at own discretion. Data allow analyses of how the relationship between employee empowerment on the one hand, and employee health <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>performance</b> on the other, can be strengthened depending on how power manifests, how facilitation by outside agents is carried out, how organisation learning is conducted, and how health and performance dimensions in work practices are intertwined. Tentative conclusions to these issues are suggested. The thesis is concluded with two lists of recommendations and dissuasions on facilitation of employee empowerment processes; one from a management perspective, and one from the perspective of an outside facilitator. These lists provide both practical and “theoretical” perspectives on how employee empowerment processes can be made conducive to both employee health <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>performance...</b>|$|R

40|$|Orientation: The {{relationship}} between Chief Executive Officer (CEO) remuneration <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>performance</b> {{has been a}} topic of close scrutiny, especially since the global financial crisis. Optimal contracting relies {{on the premise that}} effective incentives will link <b>organisation</b> financial <b>performance</b> <b>and</b> CEO remuneration in ways that will be {{in the best interests of}} both shareholders and CEOs. Research purpose: The purpose of this research study was to investigate the {{relationship between}} CEO remuneration <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>performance</b> in South Africa between 2006 and 2012 and to determine whether the two constructs were positively correlated. Motivation for the study: The study provides an evidenced-based understanding of the nature of the CEO pay-performance relationship in South Africa. Understanding this relationship is critical to finding a suitable model to structure executive remuneration that will protect shareholders from over-remunerating executives in times of economic appreciation, whilst protecting executives from being underpaid in times of economic depreciation. Method: The financial results and CEO remuneration of 21 of the top 40 listed companies on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange were analysed for the period 2006 – 2012. The research was a quantitative, archival study. The primary statistical techniques used in the study were correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis. Main findings: The primary finding of the current research indicates that between 2006 <b>and</b> 2012 <b>organisation</b> executives have noticeably been moving away from focusing on short-term incentives, which are categorised as performance-related elements of remuneration packages. Based on these findings, it is evident that the relationship between executive remuneration and organisational financial performance has been experiencing a decline, especially since the 2008 global financial crisis. The decline has predominantly been due to a move away from performance-related elements of remuneration contracts by CEOs, creating a disconnect between CEO remuneration and organisational performance. The findings suggest that, to a large extent, remuneration contracts for CEOs are no longer optimal for the <b>organisation</b> <b>and</b> its shareholders, but are influenced by the propensity of executives to enhance their own remuneration. There exists a link between short-term incentives received by CEOs and accounting-based organisational performance measures; on the other hand, fixed pay linked with organisational performance measures continue to be eroded as organisations’ executives become more innovative as they are noticeably moving away from focusing on short-term incentives [...] . ...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: A path-analytical model is adopted using questionnaire data from 84 Australian manufacturing firms.

One important issue in business–IT alignment study is the absence of alignment. By identifying factors to achieve business-IT alignment, the problem on the absence of alignment could be addressed.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{discussions on}} {{leadership}} and strategy have attracted considerable interest from academics {{on one hand}} and business practitioners on the other. Much of the interest lies in claims that both leadership and strategy are linked to business performance. This research report examines {{the nature of the relationship}} between different leadership styles <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>performance.</b> The research study hypothesised that either authoritative leadership style leads to achievement of the business strategic plan (hypothesis 1) or that participative leadership style leads to achievement of the business strategic plan (hypothesis 2). The research was a quantitative study; data was collected by means of interviews and telephone questionnaires which were administered on 38 randomly selected business owners and senior managers. A linear regression method was used to test the hypothesis. The regression analyses revealed that participative leadership style and performance and authoritative leadership style are not related. These two variables each explain less than one per cent of the variance in performance. As a result, both null hypotheses were not rejected. This research concludes with a number of implications for further research studies. Stellenbosch University [URL]...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{identifies}} {{the role of}} trust in the supply chain relationship on supply chain <b>performance</b> <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>performance.</b> An extensive review of literature identified a lack of empirical research {{to fill a gap}} in supply chain and operations management knowledge and this gap is mainly related to identification of the role that trust has on performance. This thesis considers this gap with other relevant issues identified through the literature. It presents a research framework formulated to tackle the research problem and reports an attempt to fill the existing gap through empirical research. The thesis contains analyses of three case studies related to three different territories, namely; Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and State of Qatar. The case studies encompass large <b>and</b> medium size <b>organisations</b> from three different industrial settings. In Oman, the case study is related to oilfield services and the oil production industry while in UAE the case study is related to real estate and the property development industry, and the case study in Qatar is related to the chemical industry. In addition to identifying the influence of trust in supply chain relationships on <b>organisation</b> <b>performance</b> <b>and</b> supply chain performance, the research considers the influence of the duration of the supply chain relationship on trust development in the relationship. Additionally, it explores the impact of trust on the avoidance of the bullwhip effect in the supply chain and shows through empirical evidence the role of trust in minimising supply chain risk. Consideration is given to the impact of different territory and different industrial settings on the trust/performance relationship. Triangulation of research approaches and methods is utilised in this research to enrich the research findings by exploiting the advantages of each approach and method advantages while reducing the disadvantages through complementarities between them. The results of this thesis indicate that the supply chain parties should adopt trust in their relationship whenever considering supply chain <b>performance</b> improvement, <b>organisation</b> <b>performance</b> improvement, <b>and</b> overcoming risk.

40|$|Orientation: In theory, {{effective}} remuneration contracts will link executive remuneration with <b>organisation</b> financial <b>performance</b> <b>and</b> provide strong {{incentives for}} executives to operate <b>organisations</b> <b>and</b> behave {{in ways that}} will be in the shareholders’ best interests. Many proclaim that this is not happening as CEOs continue to be rewarded even when their respective organisations are performing poorly. Research purpose: The purpose of this research study was {{to take advantage of the}} available information on executive remuneration data and establish the best link (correlation) between executive remuneration <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> financial <b>performance</b> between 2008 and 2012. Motivation for the study: The motivation for the research study was due to the acknowledged challenge encountered by organisations in finding a balance between executive remuneration that will be enticing enough to keep executives in the employ of the <b>organisation</b> <b>and</b> not overpaying them, especially when organisation’s performance is not favourable. Research design approach and method: The research was a quantitative, archival study, conducted over a seven year time period. The primary statistical techniques used in the study included: multiple correlation analysis, bivariate regression analysis, multiple regression analysis and stepwise regression analysis. Main findings/results: The primary finding was that the relationship between executive remuneration <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> financial <b>performance</b> has been experiencing a decline since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The decline has predominantly been due to a move by executives away from performance related elements of the remuneration contracts, creating disconnect between what executives are being paid and the <b>performance</b> of the <b>organisation.</b> The findings point out to the fact that, to a large extent, remuneration contracts for executives are predominantly no longer shaped by what would be optimal for an <b>organisation</b> <b>and</b> its shareholders, but are also influenced by the natural propensity of executives to influence their own remuneration contracts. Practical managerial implications: The results suggest that there is a need for superior <b>organisation</b> <b>performance</b> measures <b>and</b> innovative remuneration policies that need to be developed which will be in synchronism with the longterm strategic plans of an organisation. Contribution/value add: The study provides a key insight with regard to the fact that without any performance based elements with the executive’s remuneration, it is going to be difficult to justify the high remuneration packages of executives. In the long run, a dilemma arises for board of directors as they become reluctant to either reward executives for superior performance or punish them for poor performance.

40|$|In {{order to}} probe the {{application}} of TQM within Small and Medium Sized UK Construction-Related Organisations, a study was conducted on 63 SMEs; 20 (31. 7 %) of these reported implementation of TQM on their management system. For this purpose, a monitoring and assessment tool was developed, incorporating within it the TQM implementation quality features or techniques, grouped in 10 sub principles. The rate of TQM commitment and advancement was then measured for each organisation. The {{study was designed to}} assess the levels of advancement of implementation constructs in both UK TQM and non- TQM Construction related SMEs. The research was conducted in four stages: exploratory, descriptive, empirical and analytic research. The exploratory stage involved an extensive literature review for searching TQM models and critical success factors. The Powell (1995) instrument was selected as the criterion for the critical success factors, with the justification provided for the selection, by comparing and evaluating it with other existing and validated instruments such as Saraph et al, 1989; Flynn et al, 1995; Black and Porter, 1996 and Ahire et al, 1996. The descriptive study involved a questionnaire survey of construction related SMEs in the UK. The research design also included: an empirical investigation to assessth e critical successf actors and levels of TQM advancementin the UK construction SMEs, identification of the advocated advantages associated with the implementation, measuring the success of TQM and assessment of the business <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>performance,</b> assessment of the competitive environment. The survey was conducted to investigate the four stated issues and finally, to ascertain the combined effect of TQM practices on the business <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>performance</b> in the context of organisation size, TQM maturity and union density. The results of the surveys provided the levels of implementation of TQM in both TQM <b>and</b> Non-TQM <b>organisations.</b> The survey results of the study indicated that while TQM deploying organisations were more advanced in the observation of the deployment constructs, non-TQM organisations exhibited marked levels of achievement of implementation constructs. The empirical and analytical research involved in subjecting the developed Total Quality-Self Monitoring and Assessment Rating Tool (TQ-SMART) Model to a structural analysis based on the computation of the TQM relative advancement indices. The TQ-SMART was developed consisting of 10 TQM constructs with 34 independent variables (items). This resulted in the 10 constructs having high cronbach values. The TQ-SMART model was found to be valid, based on the goodness of fit indices. (Field 2000). It also exhibited strong undimensionality, reliability, convergent, discriminant and criterion-related validities. The structural models demonstrated and built in this study hypothesised and tested the relationship among the ten TQM deployment constructs and their contribution to the UK Construction-related SME's business and organisational performance indicators (BOPI) and competitive advantage. The explanatory research involved a detailed case study on three organisations. An interpretative approach was used to gain further insights in the implementation of TQM. This included both non-TQM <b>and</b> TQM deploying <b>organisations.</b> Though various assessment models exist, and literature has examined issues such as organisations needing to identify the unused capabilities, {{there is a lack of}} formal methods of working out the unused capabilities or conducting empirical studies. The application of the relative advancement index will prove particularly useful as benchmarks for comparison with other TQM deploying <b>organisations.</b> The Commitment <b>and</b> Advancement indices generated by the TQ-SMART Model serves as an assessment and monitoring mechanism for TQM deployment organisations at the same time as an assessment mechanism for non-TQM deploying organisations wishing to identify their existing levels of quality initiatives. Quality Managers can use this model as well as Senior Management to assess their strengths and weaknesses on the deployment constructs necessary for the effective and efficiency implementation of TQM. The research concluded that the conceptual model though not generalisable was still indicative of the general trends within the UK Construction Related SMEs.

The results showed that employee perceptions of strategy implementation obstacles positively influences <b>organisation</b> <b>performance.</b> A significant relationship was found between perceptions of communication, <b>performance</b> management <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> variables as predicting <b>organisation</b> <b>performance.</b> Prevalent indications from the results showed that resources and environment were perceived negatively and were not statistically significant in determining organisational performance among the Internet Access Providers indiscriminately impeding <b>organisation</b> <b>performance.</b> In addition, leadership and strategy formulation were not statistically significant in predicting organisational performance. The results on leadership and resources were unique as they contradicted most previous research. The key conclusion is that positive employee perceptions positively influence <b>organisation</b> <b>performance...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Many {{contemporary}} {{approaches to}} talent management are unaffordable. This paper seeks to summarise some key {{findings of a}} five-year investigation into quicker and more affordable routes to creating high <b>performance</b> <b>organisations.</b> It aims to suggest a practical and much more cost-effective way of quickly achieving multiple corporate objectives and measurable benefits for both people <b>and</b> <b>organisations</b> is often being overlooked. Design/methodology/approach – A programme of critical success factor, “issue” and other surveys was complemented with a five-year evaluation of more recent case studies to understand early adoptions of performance support and to assess their results and implications. The applications examined were discussed with the relevant technical architect and the results obtained corroborated with commissioner/user performance data and/or documented assessments/reactions. Findings – Recruiting exceptional people – even if affordable – can create a host of problems {{if they are not}} properly managed, which is often the case. Paying for talented people may make little sense for organisations that cannot harness or capture and share what they do differently. Talent needs to be relevant to what an organisation is seeking to do and critical success factors for excelling in key roles, and what top performers do differently in these areas captured and shared. Research limitations/implications – Evaluations of performance management need to consider all the objectives that are beneficially impacted. Practical implications – One can avoid certain general, expensive, time consuming and disruptive corporate programmes in an area such as talent management and adopt quick, focused, cost effective alternatives that generate large returns on investment, and quickly deliver multiple benefits for people <b>and</b> <b>organisations.</b> <b>Performance</b> support can enable average performers wherever they may be to excel at difficult jobs. Social implications – A wider range of people can be helped to do difficult jobs. Originality/value – The paper summarises the main findings of an investigation that has identified deficiencies of contemporary approaches to talent management, identifies an approach which if strategically adopted can enable relevant talent in terms of how to excel at key roles to be developed as and when required, and sets out the benefits of Talent Management 2, of which performance support is a central element...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study is to examine the {{knowledge}} management practices of financial institutions in Uganda, in order to understand how these practices influence the high <b>performance</b> <b>organisation</b> factors <b>and</b> thereby the performance of the financial institutions. Design/methodology/approach: The study includes {{a review of the literature}} concerning dominant views on knowledge management <b>and</b> high <b>performance</b> <b>organisations.</b> Moreover, the characteristics of the financial industry are discussed. Then, twenty-three firms from the financial services industry in Uganda have been selected as the sample-base for an empirical test. Findings: Obviously, knowledge management is highly inter-connected to the high performance framework. In this paper, we investigate (1) three processes of KM (knowledge acquisition, knowledge dissemination, responsiveness to knowledge) and (2) how they relate to the high <b>performance</b> <b>organisation</b> framework. The three KM processes, when executed well, result in a higher organisational performance. Research limitations: The existing theories and our research on knowledge management are in some sense limited in explaining the extent to which knowledge management is related to high <b>performance</b> <b>organisations.</b> The reasons are: infrastructure, research time, and willingness to cooperate. Practical implications: The paper may serve as a basis for financial institutions in Uganda (1) to adopt the high <b>performance</b> <b>organisation</b> framework <b>and</b> (2) to establish insights into how to improve the knowledge management practices. As such, the HPO framework might be the organisational model that managers are looking for to achieve economic, environmental, and social sustainability. Originality/value: Past research into HPOs in developed countries may not be applicable to the unique nature <b>and</b> environment of <b>organisations</b> in a developing country. The paper tries to bring forward concern in the area of knowledge management practices <b>and</b> high <b>performance</b> <b>organisation</b> in the Ugandan finance sector...|$|R
40|$|Orientation: The {{level of}} CEO {{compensation}} {{and its relationship}} with organisational performance has generated considerable interest worldwide. In light of compromised mining productivity {{as a result of}} the recent labour unrest in South African, some commentators have questioned the justification of certain CEO compensation in the country’s mining industry. Research purpose: The primary purpose of this study was to describe the relationship between CEO compensation <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> <b>performance</b> in the South African mining industry. Motivation for the study: A deeper understanding of the relationship would enhance knowledge when developing optimal CEO reward systems to ensure sustainability of the mining industry within the South African context. Research design, approach and method: The research was a quantitative, archival study involving 30 mining companies over a five year period. The statistical analysis techniques used in the study included analysis of normality variance and multivariate regression. Main findings/results: The main finding of the research was that there was a moderate to strong relationship between CEO compensation and organisational performance in the South African mining industry. However, operating expenses have progressively increased, putting performance under pressure. Furthermore, it was also found that company size plays an influential role in CEO compensation levels. Practical/managerial implications: While the CEO compensation appears to be generally aligned with the organisational performance, the findings suggest that boards of directors should focus on structuring reward systems more optimally to mitigate managerial rent seeking in large companies and unsustainability in smaller companies. Contribution/value-add: This study has contributed to the body of existing knowledge on executive pay for performance in the context of the South African mining industry. In addition, the study has demonstrated that the other non-performance related measures need to be considered in executive compensation design.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the article is to present twelve years of the National Quality Award of the Slovak Republic, survey results of the awarded <b>organisations</b> <b>and</b> their benefits {{for the success of}} the organisation. The basis is previous knowledge of recognition based on the EFQM Excellence Model and CAF Model in the Slovak Republic. The questionnaire survey has been used completed with respondent’s allegation. The aim of the survey was to gain proposals for improvements for the following annual sets of the National Quality Awards of the Slovak Republic to raise quality awareness and competitiveness of Slovak private <b>and</b> public <b>organisations.</b> The following findings were main conclusions. The most effective way of how to approach potential competition participants it to approach them with a direct email information. Expectations of most organisations entering the competition have been met. The quality model implementation and site visit based recommendations were main benefits of participating in the competition that resulted in success and added value in different areas of the <b>organisation</b> <b>and</b> its <b>performance.</b> <b>Organisations</b> that have an experience of at least one year participation in the competition claim its importance. It is also confirmed by the fact that organisations that became winners of its category in the past, backtrack to the competition after three and more years to benchmark their improvements and advancement. The competition is a strong tool that is able to assist an organisation on its journey to success and excellence...|$|R

40|$|The resource-based {{view has}} an {{established}} {{position in the}} strategic management of a public organisation. However, it is not given much attention {{in the area of}} public governance, focusing instead on analysing the impact of a single resource on an organisation’s performance. This article attempts to fill this gap by analysing the impact of strategic orientation adopted by an <b>organisation</b> on its <b>performance.</b> In addition, the analysis also covers the impact of the approach to stakeholder relations management adopted by an <b>organisation</b> on its <b>performance.</b> Studies were conducted on public healthcare entities, using a survey questionnaire and quantitative methods. The obtained results indicate that a resource-based view to strategic thinking has an impact on an organisation’s performance (negative correlation). A positive correlation, on the other hand, exists between the approach to stakeholder relations management adopted by an <b>organisation</b> <b>and</b> its <b>performance...</b>|$|R
