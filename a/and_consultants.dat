25|$|The Australian firm Multiplex, {{which was}} the main {{contractor}} on Wembley Stadium, made significant losses on the project. In an attempt to recoup some of those losses, the firm has initiated a number of legal cases against its sub-contractors <b>and</b> <b>consultants.</b> The largest of these – the largest construction claim in UK legal history – was a claim for £253million against the structural engineering consultants Mott MacDonald. In preliminary hearings the two architecture practices which worked for Multiplex on the project were ordered to allow Multiplex access to their records {{in order for them}} to build a case. The practices, Foster + Partners and Populous, estimated the costs of providing access and answering Multiplex's queries at £5million. The case was not due to be heard until January 2011. Mott MacDonald has issued a counter-claim for unpaid fees of £250,000. The dispute between Multiplex (now known as Brookfield) and Mott MacDonald was settled out of court in June 2010, the judge having warned that costs were likely to be more than £74million.|$|E
