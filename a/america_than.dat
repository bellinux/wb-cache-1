5|$|A {{large-scale}} {{slave trade}} with English privateers was begun. The {{life expectancy of}} slaves was much higher in North <b>America</b> <b>than</b> further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase {{in the numbers of}} slaves. Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice. But {{by the turn of the}} 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.|$|E
5|$|Coat color {{ranges from}} almost pure white through various shades of blond, cream, and ochre to grays, browns, and blacks, with {{variation}} in fur color tending {{to increase in}} higher latitudes. Differences in coat color between sexes are largely absent, though females may have redder tones. Black-colored wolves in North America inherited the Kb allele responsible for melanism from past interbreeding with dogs, while the mutation {{was found to be}} naturally occurring in wolves from Iran. Black specimens are more common in North <b>America</b> <b>than</b> in Eurasia, with about half the wolves in Yellowstone National Park being black.|$|E

5|$|Fox Terriers are two {{different}} breeds of the terrier dog type: the Smooth Fox Terrier and the Wire Fox Terrier. Both of these breeds originated in the 19th century {{from a handful of}} dogs who are descended from earlier varieties of British terriers, and are related to other modern white terrier breeds. In addition, a number of breeds have diverged from these two main types of fox terrier and have been recognised separately, including the Jack Russell Terrier, Miniature Fox Terrier and Rat Terrier. The Wire and Smooth Fox Terriers share similar characteristics, the main differences being in the coat and markings. They have been successful in conformation shows, more prominently in <b>America</b> <b>than</b> their homeland.|$|E
5|$|Nest {{sites are}} varied, though {{cavities}} are preferred. Nests {{are most frequently}} built in the eaves and other crevices of houses. Holes in cliffs and banks, or tree hollows, are also used. A sparrow sometimes excavates its own nests in sandy banks or rotten branches, but more frequently uses the nests of other birds {{such as those of}} swallows in banks and cliffs, and old tree cavity nests. It usually uses deserted nests, though sometimes it usurps active ones. Tree hollows are more commonly used in North <b>America</b> <b>than</b> in Europe, putting the sparrows in competition with bluebirds and other North American cavity nesters, and thereby contributing to their population declines.|$|E

From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was invested in private biotechnology companies in <b>America</b> <b>than</b> in Europe.

5|$|Barn owls are cavity nesters. They choose {{holes in}} trees, {{fissures}} in cliff faces, the large nests of other birds {{such as the}} hamerkop (Scopus umbretta) and, particularly in Europe and North America, old buildings such as farm sheds and church towers. Buildings are preferred to trees in wetter climates in the British Isles and provide better protection for fledglings from inclement weather. Trees tend to be in open habitats {{rather than in the}} middle of woodland and nest holes tend to be higher in North <b>America</b> <b>than</b> in Europe because of possible predation by raccoons (Procyon lotor). No nesting material is used as such but, as the female sits incubating the eggs, she draws in the dry furry material of which her regurgitated pellets are composed, so that by the time the chicks are hatched, they are surrounded by a carpet of shredded pellets. Oftentimes other birds such as jackdaws (Corvus monedula) nest in the same hollow tree or building and seem to live harmoniously with the owls.|$|E
5|$|Poole {{established}} successful commerce {{with the}} North American colonies in the 16th century, including the important fisheries of Newfoundland. Trade with Newfoundland grew steadily {{to meet the}} demand for fish from the Catholic countries of Europe. Poole's share of this trade varied but the most prosperous period started in the early 18th century and lasted until the early 19th century. The trade followed a three-cornered route; ships sailed to Newfoundland with salt and provisions, then carried dried and salted fish to Europe before returning to Poole with wine, olive oil, and salt. By the early 18th century Poole had more ships trading with North <b>America</b> <b>than</b> any other English port and vast wealth was brought to Poole's merchants. This prosperity supported much of the development which now characterises the Old Town where many of the medieval buildings were replaced with Georgian mansions and terraced housing. The end of the Napoleonic Wars and the conclusion of the War of 1812 ended Britain's monopoly over the Newfoundland fisheries and other nations took over services provided by Poole's merchants at a lower cost. Poole's Newfoundland trade rapidly declined and within a decade most merchants had ceased trading.|$|E
5|$|When {{competing}} for food, eagles will usually dominate other fish-eaters and scavengers, aggressively displacing mammals such as coyotes (Canis latrans) and foxes, and birds such as corvids, gulls, vultures and other raptors. Occasionally, coyotes, bobcats (Lynx rufus) and domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) can displace eagles from carrion, usually less confident immature birds, {{as has been}} recorded in Maine. Bald eagles are less active, bold predators than golden eagles and get relatively more of their food as carrion and from kleptoparasitism (although it is now generally thought that golden eagles eat more carrion than was previously assumed). However, the two species are roughly equal in size, aggressiveness and physical strength and so competitions can go either way. Neither species {{is known to be}} dominant, and the outcome depends on the size and disposition of the individual eagles involved. The bald eagle is thought to be much more numerous in North <b>America</b> <b>than</b> the golden eagle, with the bald species estimated to number at least 150,000 individuals, about twice as many golden eagles there are estimated to live in North America. Due to this, bald eagles often outnumber golden eagles at attractive food sources. Despite the potential for contention between these animals, in New Jersey during winter, a golden eagle and numerous bald eagles were observed to hunt snow geese alongside each other without conflict. Similarly, both eagle species have been recorded, via video-monitoring, to feed on gut pills and carcasses of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in remote forest clearings in the eastern Appalachian Mountains without apparent conflict. Many bald eagles are habitual kleptoparasites, especially in winters when fish are harder to come by. They have been recorded stealing fish from other predators such as ospreys, herons and even otters. They have also been recorded opportunistically pirating birds from peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), prairie dogs from ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis) and even jackrabbits from golden eagles. When they approach scavengers like dogs, gulls or vultures at carrion sites, they often aggressively attack them and try to force them to disgorge their food. Healthy adult bald eagles are not preyed on in the wild and are thus considered apex predators.|$|E
