5|$|Speaking {{about the}} gameplay, Famitsu was {{slightly}} mixed about some aspects; one critic praised the added tutorial for allowing new players to be eased {{in the series}} gameplay, while another compared the tutorial to a nagging mother and said it and the unseen Tactician representing the player might grate with series fans. Bramwell praised the integration of RPG elements and tactical gameplay, in addition to finding the permanent death of characters a suitable fit for the game's world. Dingo was positive about the level design and controls, but warned that it was quite short and lacking in depth when compared to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Massimilla found the gameplay both accessible and challenging <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> through the game, while Nutt was skeptical about the permanent death system and critical of the in-game economy despite generally enjoying the experience. Harris again compared it to Advance Wars, but said that Fire Emblem had enough unique elements to make it its own product, and generally praised the title's accomplishments. Burns, who had experience of earlier Fire Emblem titles, praised the game as a worthy entry in the series and a good entry for the West to experience.|$|E
25|$|Wallis {{served as}} the {{temporary}} captain of the British frigate {{for a period of}} exactly six days <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> back to Halifax, Nova Scotia, with Chesapeake flying the Blue Ensign above the Stars and Stripes, for which action he was promoted to commander on 9 July 1813.|$|E
25|$|Inspection {{disclosed}} that the bombs had dished in the hull plating {{in the vicinity}} of the after torpedo room and the maneuvering room, causing a leak in a vent riser. Less than ten minutes after the Japanese plane had been sighted, the commanding officer decided to discontinue the patrol. Throughout the ship, sheared off valves and bolts, damaged meters, clocks, and gauges attested to the force of the bomb's explosion. In addition, all three radio antennas were down, a leak in her pressure hull had been aggravated, and Tunnys rudder action indicated possible damage. She set her course for Balintang Channel and surfaced late in the day on 2 September. Tunny continued to sight Japanese airplanes <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> to Hawaii. She completed this patrol on 17 September at Pearl Harbor.|$|E
60|$|The {{poor woman}} hesitated <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> little speech, and once cast her eye round in fear upon her companion.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> laughed <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> adieux and departed. The {{door closed}} heavily behind her. Selingman came {{a little further}} into the room.|$|R

25|$|As Greif {{made her}} way towards Arendal, the torpedo boat {{encountered}} thick fog, forcing Kapitänleutnant von Lyncker to decrease the vessel's speed, delaying the arrival at Arendal. According to the operational plans for the invasion, all the German landing groups were to arrive at their targets simultaneously at 04:15. Greif arrived at Arendal at 08:20. At 01:00, still more than seven hours from their objective, the Germans had received radio reports of fighting {{taking place in the}} Oslofjord. All the lighthouses along the southern Norwegian coast, from Marstein Lighthouse in the west to the Swedish border in the east had been turned off the previous evening, on the orders of Commanding Admiral Henry Diesen of the Royal Norwegian Navy. Although spotted by customs personnel <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> through the narrows leading to the town, the reports of the intruding warship did not reach Lieutenant Holthe on board Jo.|$|E
2500|$|Speaker Pelosi was {{instrumental}} in the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Pelosi was a key figure in convincing President Barack Obama to continue pushing for health care reform after the election of Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown in a January special election, a defeat that was seen as potentially fatal to Democratic reform efforts. [...] After delivering 219 votes in the House for Obama's signature health care package, Pelosi was both praised and heckled <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> to Capitol Hill.|$|E

60|$|Mount Hope Farm was {{a strangely}} dismal place that night. Miss Salome sighed heavily and often <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> {{preparations}} for the morrow's journey.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And, mamma,' and {{she whispered}} close into <b>her</b> mother's ear, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> next request; 'and, mamma, {{you will be}} with me on that day?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What indiscretion?" [...] Violet, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> {{demand for}} a more direct accusation, stood quite upright before her aunt, looking the old woman full in the face,--almost with her arms akimbo.|$|R
2500|$|SS Mont-Blanc was a {{freighter}} {{built in}} Middlesbrough, England in 1899 and {{purchased by the}} French company, Société Générale de Transport Maritime (SGTM). On Thursday morning, 6 December 1917, she entered Halifax Harbour in Nova Scotia, Canada laden with a full cargo of highly volatile explosives. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> through the Narrows towards Bedford Basin, {{she was involved in}} a collision with the Norwegian ship, [...] A fire aboard the French ship ignited her cargo of wet and dry picric acid, TNT, and guncotton. The resultant Halifax Explosion levelled the Richmond District and killed approximately 2,000 people.|$|E

60|$|There was a {{great deal}} of {{confused}} kissing and embracing <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> upstairs. 'But oh, my Tedo, what has happened?' for she beheld a fine sample of Bill Harewood's violet eye.|$|E
60|$|She watched Sir Timothy, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> confession, {{a little}} wistfully. He said nothing, {{but there was}} a very curious change in his expression. He smiled at her in an {{altogether}} unfamiliar way.|$|R
6000|$|... "You dreamed it, Sally. Go to sleep, and don't do it again," [...] said Nelly, on {{the fifth}} day, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> evening call and found the girls yawning and cross for want of rest.|$|R
5000|$|In July 1928 Rosendahl {{traveled}} to Britain to observe their airship activities, {{and then to}} Germany for the trials of the airship [...] In October he was an observer aboard the Graf <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> first Atlantic crossing from Friedrichshafen to Lakehurst.|$|R
6000|$|... "We have met," [...] Anna declared, smiling, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> {{towards the}} door, [...] "but {{we do not}} know one another. It is best like that. Herr Selingman and I work in the same army--" ...|$|E
6000|$|As Magdalen {{crossed the}} {{threshold}} of the door she was met by the postman ascending the house steps with a letter picked out from the bundle in his hand. [...] "Noel Vanstone, Esquire?" [...] she heard the man say, interrogatively, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> down the front garden to the street.|$|E
60|$|At {{this place}} they {{remained}} some two hours. Coffee was prepared here, and Mrs. Arkwright refreshed {{herself and her}} child. They washed and arranged their clothes, and when she stepped down the steep bank, clinging to her husband's arm <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> towards the boat, she smiled upon him {{as he looked at}} her.|$|E
5000|$|... 2009 saw Emma Smith {{compete in}} her second World Age Championships, held in St Petersburg, Russia. There {{she took the}} silver medal in the 17-18 girls category. That was her last event as a junior <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> {{transition}} to a senior in 2010.|$|R
60|$|This {{filled in}} the first week or two of her stay, and she {{suffered}} less from loneliness than she expected; it came only at intervals, just before going to sleep, or in the morning, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> toilet for each new but eventless day.|$|R
5000|$|... 2009, was a {{breakthrough}} {{year for the}} South African player <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> Grand Slam main draw debut getting through the Qualifying draw in the 2009 Australian Open and 2009 French Open. <b>She</b> also <b>made</b> four main draw wins and won a title in Irapuato, Mexico.|$|R
60|$|When he {{returned}} {{she had left}} her seat; but he heard her name announced on the stairs, and caught a glance {{of the back of}} her head <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> gracefully down through the crowd. He never attempted to make love to her again, utterly disappointing the hopes of Lady de Courcy, Mrs Proudie, and Lady Clandidlem.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is a gay {{and lively}} {{beginning}} for a hermit," [...] she thought, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> around the house, [...] "and I don't see {{how on earth}} I am {{ever going to get}} through that window again. There is nothing to stand on. I did not expect to go back until they were all up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “History {{does not}} record {{an act of}} finer heroism {{than that of the}} gallant men who are prisoners over there. I watched the Merrimac <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> to the {{entrance}} of the harbour, and my heart sank as I saw the perfect hell of fire that fell upon those devoted men. I did not think it possible one of them could have gone through it alive.|$|E
50|$|Shaw {{competed in}} the NASCAR Whelen All American Series {{in the spring of}} 2009 accumulating several top-ten finishes.

60|$|Katarina {{was a girl}} of some {{fourteen}} years of age. She was dressed in black, and was tall and slight.

6000|$|... "Arthur Preston Heigham!" [...] Mrs. Carr said to herself, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> {{down to her}} {{carriage}} in Fenchurch Street. [...] "Arthur is pretty, and Preston is pretty, but I don't {{much like}} Heigham. At any rate, {{there is no doubt}} about his being a gentleman. I wonder what he is going to Madeira for? He has an interesting face. I think I am glad we are going to be fellow-passengers." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{they got}} out, and Ralph having {{fastened}} the reins to the dashboard, clicked {{to the old}} mare, who walked away by herself. Cicely was greatly interested, and the two stood and watched the sober-minded animal <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> home as quietly and properly {{as if she had}} been driven. When she entered the gate of the barnyard, and stopped at the stable door, Ralph remarked that she would stand there until Mike came out, and then the two went into the field and walked up the hill.|$|E
60|$|When Kate {{had made}} a clean breast of all her {{troubles}} to the widow Scully, and had secured that good woman's co-operation, a great weight {{seemed to have been}} lifted from her heart, and she sprang from the shed a different woman. It would soon be like a dream, all these dreary weeks in the grim old house. Within a day she was sure that either Tom or the major would find means of communicating with her. The thought made her so happy that the colour stole back into her cheeks, and she sang for very lightness of heart <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> back to the Priory.|$|E
60|$|Gertrude's {{eyes flashed}} with anger <b>as</b> <b>she</b> vindicated her absent lord. Mrs. Val had been {{speaking}} with bated breath, {{so that no}} one had heard her but she to whom she was speaking; but Gertrude had been unable so to confine <b>her</b> answers, and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> last reply Madame Jaquêtanàpe and the Misses Neverbend were all ears.|$|R
50|$|The crowds were gathered, the TV {{crews were}} in {{position}} and around 1.30pm the Medway Queen was finally in sight <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> final leg of her journey {{to her new}} home at Gillingham Pier. Under the guidance of tug master Alan Pratt the historic vessel was brought gently into the pier at high tide.|$|R
60|$|As I {{leaned against}} the rail, dismissing premonitions of disaster, I could not help {{thinking}} of Miss West below, bustling and humming <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> little nest. And from her my thought drifted on to the everlasting mystery of woman. Yes, I, with all the futuristic contempt for woman, am ever caught up afresh by the mystery of woman.|$|R
