50|$|The alaunt, or <b>alant,</b> was a {{somewhat}} more robust animal than the greyhound, and therefore used against larger game, such as bears or boars. The alaunt was considered a reckless animal, and had been known to attack domestic animals, or even its owner. The mastiff was an even more rugged breed, and though also used on the larger game, was mostly considered useful as a guard-dog.|$|E
5000|$|The hound or dog (also levrier, leverer; French lévrier; dogue, chien) {{is used as}} {{a charge}} in {{classical}} heraldry.In English heraldry, the commonly used variant are the talbot, also blazoned as sleuth-hound, e.g. in the arms of Wolseley of Staffordshire, the greyhound and bloodhound.Rarely-seen variants are the ratch-hound, the mastiff (<b>alant</b> or aland), the foxhound, the spaniel and the terrier.The [...] "sea-dog" [...] is a curious charge resembling the talbot but with scales, webbed feet and a broad tail, used in the arms of Stourton barony, presumably originally depicting a beaver (as used in the Coat of arms of Oxford).Similar charges include the wolf and the fox.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we give a short {{introduction}} to the local uniformization problem. This follows a similar line as the one presented by the second author in his talk at <b>ALANT</b> 3. We also discuss our paper on the reduction of local uniformization to the rank one case. In that paper, we prove {{that in order to}} obtain local uniformization for valuations centered at objects of a subcategory of the category of noetherian integral domains, it is enough to prove it for rank one valuations centered at objects of the same category. We also announce an extension of this work which was partially developed during <b>ALANT</b> 3. This extension says that the reduction mentioned above also works for noetherian rings with zero divisors (including the case of non-reduced rings) ...|$|E

40|$|What {{do women}} want? This {{question}} {{is being asked}} by global wine producers and marketers as {{the significance of the}} female market segment has been recognised for its contribution to sales and income. In recent years, Berringer Blass has employed an all‐female team to design and market ‘White Lie’, a wine targeted specifically at women wine consumers (Todd, 2005). Bruwer, Li, Bastian and <b>Alant</b> (2005) also noted the emergence of wines positioned primarily for female consumers, such as ‘Bend on the River’ in Germany and ‘Annabella’ in Australia. But does the female wine consumer actually behave substantially differently from her male counterpart? This multi‐national study sought to understand whether significant differences in wine purchasing or consumption behaviour could indeed be explained by gender. Knowledge of gender‐based behavioural differences would be of use to the wine industry in terms of targeting and satisfying specific market segments...|$|E
40|$|Questions {{have been}} raised at BUMED 21 {{concerning}} the need for color vision requirements, the granting of waivers for color vision deficiency, the evaluation of "functional color vision " through field tests, and the interpretation of sections of the U. S. Navy's Manual of the Medical Department pertaining to color perception testing. Most recently these issues have been brought up in regard to Nuclear Field Duty personnel, but the questions have also come up {{over the years in}} the context of line officers, submariners, and other ratings. FINDINGS The basic facts of color vision deficiency and its testing are reviewed, including the rationale for the design of the Farnsworth Lantern (F <b>ALANT),</b> the standard Navy test for color perception. Also reviewed are studies of the performance of various types and degrees of color vision defectives and previous considerations of Navy color vision standards. It is concluded that personnel who do not pass the FALANT should not be generally accepted for positions that involve color vision tasks.

40|$|The use {{of graphic}} symbols forms an {{integral}} part of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies, particularly for pre-literate children. Although some studies have indicated that typically developing children and those with autism are able to learn symbol meanings with multiple exposures to graphic symbols, little is known about how children with autism rate {{the degree to which the}} symbol represents its referent (translucency) with repeated exposures. The purpose of this study was to describe the translucency ratings of children with autism over three consecutive exposures. Twenty-two children with autism participated in a Blissymbol translucency task that included 40 symbols. The Blissymbol task was modifi ed from Bornman, <b>Alant,</b> and du Preez (2009), who explored the translucency of Blissymbols with typically developing children. Findings of this study indicated statistically signifi cant differences in total translucency ratings of the Blissymbols by the children with autism between Day 1 and Day 3 (medium effect size) with Day 3 yielding more positive ratings than Day 1. No single Blissymbol showed statistically signifi cant differences over the days. Findings are interpreted and further implications for research are discussed.

40|$|Over {{the last}} ten years there has been an {{expansion}} in the number of symbol sets available to Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) users, their therapists, teachers and carers. They have tended to be developed in USA or Europe with English or European language word lists, although some have other language options including Arabic. The problem is that few show the traits of true localisation where solutions have to be found for “the differences between cultures and the problems that are likely to occur because of these differences” (Evers et al., 2000). Researchers have shown in relation to symbol use for communication {{that it is important to}} have: • translucency (How appropriate is a proposed symbol for a suggested meaning?) (Bloomberg et al. 1990), • guessability (Can subjects guess the intended meaning of a symbol?) (Hanson & Hartzema 1995, Dowse & Ehlers 2001, 2003), and • iconicity (How distinctive are the symbols?) (Haupt & <b>Alant</b> 2003). Simple language translations may offer word for word matching within the lexicons, but they tend to miss the issues of local colloquial vocabulary, cultural, social and environmental differences which can all impact on the speed of communication especially when using many inappropriate icons, pictorgrams and other types of imagery to support dialogue and literacy skills...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discern the intra-regional visitation {{patterns}} of wine tourists. Exploratory research was conducted in two branded wine regions, to conceptualise the spatial movement of wine tourists in a theoretical construct. Design/methodology/approach – Information was obtained from a random sample of 214 visitors to 25 wineries in two branded wine regions in South Australia. Data were collected by means of face-to-face interviews using a highly structured questionnaire at each of the winery cellar door venues. Findings – A conceptual theory regarding winery visitation sets (VSs) was developed. Discernable spatial visitation patterns to wineries result from the dynamic interaction of visitors’ needs and the incumbent winery profiles that exist in a hierarchy within a wine region. The grouping of sequentially visited wineries in the three-tier hierarchy form specific VSs of wineries. Winery profiles are initially determined by visitation incidence: the most visited Regional Centre Point (RCP) winery is followed by sequentially less visited regional profile (RP) wineries and a third tier of regional attribute (RA) wineries. Visitation pattern trends are identifiable and differ between first-time and repeat visitors. Research limitations/implications – It is possible to detail the market segmentation of wine tourists quite accurately in terms of their psychographics and demographics and favoured visitation patterns within the branded wine region. This will also provide important insights into the balance of winery and cellar door roles in the region and confirm the “optimal” number of wineries required to fulfil the needs of the ever-increasing numbers of wine tourists. Originality/value – This paper is of value to academic researchers, wine industry practitioners and travel and accommodation providers alike as it provides the foundation for a conceptual theory to explain the discernable intra-regional visitation patterns of wine tourists to the cellar doors of wineries.

40|$|Global {{growth in}} wine tourism mirrors that of wine {{consumption}} and rural tourism. Existing research reveals that wine tourists look for dining, shopping, cultural, and recreational activities (Getz 2 ̆ 6 Brown, 2006 b) and are driven to escape and enjoy socializing with friends (Getz 2 ̆ 6 Carlsen, 2008; Mitchel 2 ̆ 6 Hall, 2006). Together these motivations suggest {{the value of}} hedonic and experiential consumption theories which have been recently referenced in wine tourism literature (Bruwer 2 ̆ 6 <b>Alant,</b> 2009). The present study utilized the central constructs of the experience economy model, namely the 4 Es [...] education, esthetics, entertainment, and escapist [...] (Pine 2 ̆ 6 Gilmore, 1999) to explain the experiential nature of wine tourism. A scale was adapted {{that proved to be}} reliable and constructive through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for measuring rural wine tourism. Data collected from 970 visitors demonstrated the validity of the experience economy in predicting intentions to recommend and return to the Chautauqua-Lake Erie wine tourism destination. Findings were consistent with measurement of these experiential elements in other tourism settings (Hosany 2 ̆ 6 Withiam, 2010; Oh, Fiore, 2 ̆ 6 Jeoung, 2007), namely esthetics provided the most statistically significant construct, mediating other predictors such as gender, history of previous visits, and activity level, shown to be statistically significant using multiple regression equations. In addition a second scale was tested and proved to be successful via CFA for measuring tourism suppliers 2 ̆ 7 4 E priorities in creating the visitor experience. Welch 2 ̆ 7 s t-tests between tourists 2 ̆ 7 evaluations and the business providers 2 ̆ 7 priorities demonstrated various gaps between what is believed to be offered by the wine tourism supply chain and what tourists experienced. Stakeholder analysis confirmed several key differences among four tourism supplier groups (winery owners and farmers; restaurateurs and retailers; lodging operators, and attraction providers) on issues of importance to successful wine tourism, although, agreement on a dozen concerns were also identified. This study advances the emergent theory in experiential consumption and wine tourism offering a circumferential view of both supply of and demand for experiential consumption that may be applied to wine tourism geographies in varying stages of development. Consequently, the work offers new theoretical directions for rural wine tourism stakeholders and practical insights for contemporary applications of the findings for marketers...|$|E
