50|$|The Department of Defense <b>Ammunition</b> <b>Code</b> (DODAC) is an 8-symbol (7 digits and a letter) hybrid code designation. It {{uses the}} munition's four-digit Federal Supply Classification Group (the first four digits of the item's FSN) {{followed}} by its alphanumeric DODIC. It is used mostly when filling out ammunition record sheets. This {{is done to}} prevent errors and confusion during ammunition transactions.|$|E
50|$|A field {{artillery}} version {{seems to have}} been developed or under development in 1941, its <b>ammunition</b> <b>codes</b> are listed in Field Service Pocket Book, Pamphlet No. 9a, dated 29 October 1941. The ammunition is listed in BOTH the anti-tank and {{field artillery}} sections.|$|R
5000|$|MIL-STD-1168, a {{classification}} system for ammunition production that replaced the <b>Ammunition</b> Identification <b>Code</b> (AIC) system used during World War II.|$|R
50|$|The MIL-STD-1168 {{is a set}} of {{standard}} codes used to identify ammunition. It was designed to replace the previous confusing <b>Ammunition</b> Identification <b>Code</b> (AIC) system used by the US Army Ordnance Corps.|$|R
5000|$|A {{horizontal}} {{straight line}} through two circles indicates linked <b>ammunition.</b> The alphanumeric <b>code</b> after it indicates {{the type of}} links used (i.e., M27 for 5.56mm M27 links).|$|R
50|$|Ammunition crates {{were marked}} with the FSN and DODIC {{along the top of}} the front panel. Early crates from 1949 to 1956 also {{included}} the alphanumeric <b>Ammunition</b> Identification <b>Code</b> in the upper right corner. The weight in pounds and volume in cubic feet were stamped in the lower left corner. The Lot Code was stamped in the lower right corner. The text in the center of the front panel detailed the amount and type of contents the crate contained.|$|R
5000|$|A Federal Stock Number (FSN) was an 11-digit numeric code. It {{was first}} used by the Defense Munitions Board's Cataloging Agency in 1949 to {{identify}} items in the Joint Army-Navy Catalog System. On July 7, 1952 Public Law 82-436 (Defense Cataloging and Standardization Act) {{was passed by the}} second session of the 82nd Congress. It authorized the FSN to replace the <b>Ammunition</b> Identification <b>Code</b> (AIC) and Ordnance Stock Number (OSN). The Federal Stock Number was used officially from 1953 to 1974, when it was replaced by the National Stock Number. The conversion from FSN to NSN was typically done by adding [...] "00" [...] between the first set of numbers (the Federal Supply Class, or FSC) and the second set of numbers.|$|R
5000|$|The Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute (SAAMI, {{pronounced}} [...] "Sammy") is {{an association}} of American firearms and ammunition manufacturers. SAAMI publishes various industry standards related to the field, including fire <b>code,</b> <b>ammunition</b> and chamber specifications, and acceptable chamber pressure.In the United States, firearms and ammunition specifications are not overseen by the Consumer Product Safety Commission or any other branch of government. Only manufacturers that are members of SAAMI are bound by the Institute's guidelines.|$|R
50|$|It was {{designed}} to simplify and standardize the cataloging of common items in use by the Department of Defense. It replaced the earlier hodgepodge of cataloging systems in use. The Standard Nomenclature List (SNL) {{was created by the}} US Army Ordnance Corps in 1930 and was used until 1958. The <b>Ammunition</b> Identification <b>Code</b> (AIC) was a sub-set of the SNL concerning munitions and explosives that was used from January, 1942 to 1958. The SNL and AIC were listed in the Ordnance Supply Catalog, which was managed by the US Army Ordnance Corps. The Quartermaster Stock Number (QSN), which codified items by government contract number, was created by the Treasury Department in 1943; it was used by the US Army Quartermaster Corps officially from 1946 to 1956. The Medical Departments of the Army, Navy and Air Force each had their own systems as well.|$|R
50|$|A059 is the DODIC {{code for}} 5.56mm NATO M855 Ball type <b>ammunition.</b> The DODIC <b>code</b> also {{indicates}} that it is packed in 10-round stripper clips, 3 clips per cardboard spacer (3 clips / 30 rounds), and 4 spacers packed in a 4-pocket M8 bandoleer (one 3-clip spacer per pocket / 120 rounds per bandoleer). There are seven M8 bandoleers packed per recloseable metal M2A1 ammo can (840 rounds per can) {{and there are two}} M2A1 ammo cans per wire-bound plywood crate (1680 rounds per crate).|$|R
5|$|The group {{intentionally}} avoids {{any area}} where crime rates {{could result in}} frequent law enforcement interventions and commandos are instructed to be polite and are warned {{to stay away from}} illegal activities; association or deals with criminal organizations are prohibited. In keeping a discipline code, the organization also discourages the use of alcohol and prohibits the use of drugs. The EPB attempts to stay away from areas where other nationalist groups are based in order to avoid attention. There also settle away from military of police stations. Meetings are generally held in places with good reputation and in buildings that offer several access points, with heavy precautions being taken to reach their locations untailed. If different units are meeting, commandoes are instructed to place hoods or masks and use codenames in order to protect their identities, both to accomplish plausible denial and to root out any law enforcement plant. Information is segregated between groups and only shared in limited detail, when necessary. Incriminating or detailed documents or any other evidence is to be destroyed once the potential of a law enforcement intervention is apparent. While involved in a particular mission, the EPB commandoes regularly assume a faux name, but they usually use this to acquire legitimate documents and select a nondescript address in which to receive mail in a fashion that prevents surveillance, such a P.O. Box or an decoy address where mail is delivered to the community in general. Even <b>ammunitions</b> were given <b>codes</b> such as Manteca for firearms or Libretas for explosives to conceal their nature. Armories were specifically retrofitted to preserve the condition and to prepare new ammunition as needed. Funds are managed strictly and reports are constant in order to keep a balanced budget.|$|R
