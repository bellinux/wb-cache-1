5|$|The {{common loon}} {{produces}} {{a variety of}} vocalizations, {{the most common of}} which are the tremolo, the yodel, the wail, and the hoot. Each of these calls communicates a distinct message. The frequency at which it vocalizes has been shown to vary based on time of day, weather, and season. It is most vocally active between mid-May and mid-June. The wail, yodel, and tremolo calls are sounded more frequently at night than during the day; calls have also been shown to occur more frequently in cold temperatures <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is little to no rain.|$|E
5|$|Meera (Ayesha Takia), {{a simple}} Rajasthani Hindu woman, has {{everything}} {{in her life}} in accordance with customs and traditions: her formative years, her recent marriage into a traditional Rajasthani family and her daily chores {{within the walls of}} her haveli. Coincidentally, her husband, Shankar, is in Saudi Arabia, his new workplace. Meera finds it tough without her husband but they manage to stay in touch. Shankar regularly sends his wages home to support his family that includes his father, Randhir Singh (Girish Karnad), mother, Gowri Singh (Prateeksha Lonkar), his paternal grandmother (Uttara Baokar) and Meera. One day, Meera does not find the remittance from Shankar. Time passes <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> are neither any further remittances nor any correspondence from her husband, Meera gets worried. When frantic inquiries are made, she is devastated to know that Shankar was killed in a freak accident that was allegedly caused by his Muslim roommate.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is {{estimated}} to make up about 1ppm or 2ppm of the Earth's crust by weight. There are many species of tantalum minerals, only {{some of which are}} so far being used by industry as raw materials: tantalite, microlite, wodginite, euxenite, polycrase. Tantalite (Fe, Mn)Ta2O6 is the most important mineral for tantalum extraction. Tantalite has the same mineral structure as columbite (Fe, Mn) (Ta, Nb)2O6; when there is more tantalum than niobium it is called tantalite <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is more niobium than tantalum is it called columbite (or niobite). The high density of tantalite and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation the best method. Other minerals include samarskite and fergusonite.|$|E

They finished fourth in 1947, beating San Francisco in the first round before losing to Los Angeles. Stengel managed the Oaks for a third year in 1948, with the roster heavy with former major leaguers. Among the younger players on the team was 20-year-old shortstop Billy Martin. Stengel was impressed by Martin's fielding, baseball acuity, <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> were brawls on the field, fighting ability. The Oaks clinched the pennant on September 26, and defeated Los Angeles and the Seattle Rainiers to win the Governors' Cup. The Sporting News named Stengel the Minor League Manager of the Year.|$|E
5|$|When {{there are}} few copies of an allele, the effect of genetic drift is larger, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> are many copies the effect is smaller. In the early 20th century, {{vigorous}} debates occurred over {{the relative importance of}} natural selection versus neutral processes, including genetic drift. Ronald Fisher, who explained natural selection using Mendelian genetics, held the view that genetic drift plays at the most a minor role in evolution, and this remained the dominant view for several decades. In 1968, population geneticist Motoo Kimura rekindled the debate with his neutral theory of molecular evolution, which claims that most instances where a genetic change spreads across a population (although not necessarily changes in phenotypes) are caused by genetic drift acting on neutral mutations.|$|E

25|$|Individuals may {{migrate from}} their birth or founded colony {{to take up}} {{residence}} in another. This is most common during the pre-emergence phase <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> are around forty to fifty adults on the home nest. Migrant wasps {{are more likely to be}} accepted while they are younger, which is generally less than six days old. Age has been shown to be the determining factor for whether the resident wasps react with hostility or tolerance. Age might be an indicator of ovarian development (reproductive threat) or of other important qualities such as plasticity for role specialization. Multiple-foundress colonies are preferentially selected by migrant wasps, despite the fact that individuals are more successful at becoming a queen in a single-foundress colony. Young migrants become fully integrated into the new colony, becoming foragers and sometimes taking over the role of queen.|$|E

25|$|In 1870 Brazil's {{trade with}} America was valued at about 31 million dollars while the {{combined}} trade {{of all the}} South American countries was valued at about $29million. Brazil was a significant producer of coffee {{and because of this}} the United States imported about four times as much as it exported to Brazil. In 1885 Brazil was producing more than one half of the world's supply of coffee. Brazil's trade in 1890 was more than $71million while that of Argentina and Chile was $14million and $6million respectively. Soon after 1896, the production of coffee started to surpass consumption and prices began to fall in Brazil. Brazil then stored their coffee instead of selling all of it, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> was bad season of coffee production they would use what they had previously stored from the year before.|$|E
25|$|Political {{scientist}} Barbara Walter {{suggests that}} most contemporary civil wars are actually repeats of earlier civil wars that often arise when leaders are not {{accountable to the}} public, when there is poor public participation in politics, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> {{is a lack of}} transparency of information between the executives and the public. Walter argues that when these issues are properly reversed, they act as political and legal restraints on executive power forcing the established government to better serve the people. Additionally, these political and legal restraints create a standardized avenue to influence government as well as increasing the commitment credibility of established peace treaties. According to Walter, it is the strength of a nation’s institutionalization and good governance—not the presence of democracy nor the poverty level—that is the number one indicator of the chance of a repeat civil war according to Walter.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{represent}} tries, corresponding to different trade-offs between memory use and speed of the operations. The basic form is that of a linked set of nodes, where each node contains an array of child pointers, one for each symbol in the alphabet (so for the English alphabet, one would store 26 child pointers and for the alphabet of bytes, 256 pointers). This is simple but wasteful in terms of memory: using the alphabet of bytes (size 256) and four-byte pointers, each node requires a kilobyte of storage, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is little overlap in the strings' prefixes, the number of required nodes is roughly the combined length of the stored strings. Put another way, the nodes {{near the bottom of the}} tree tend to have few children and there are many of them, so the structure wastes space storing null pointers.|$|E
