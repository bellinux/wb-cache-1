5|$|A 2017 {{study by}} Thomas D. Carr, David J. Varricchio et al found that tyrannosaurs had large, flat scales on their snouts. At {{the center of}} these scales were small, keratinised patches. In crocodilians, such patches cover dense bundles of nerve fibers that pick-up {{vibrations}} and pressure changes. They proposed that tyrannosaurs probably also possessed such bundles of sensitive nerve fibers <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> used them to identify objects, measure the temperature of their nests and to pick-up eggs and hatchlings.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} folktale on Sumatra and Borneo and {{in popular}} culture, is that male orangutans display sexual attraction to human women, {{and may even}} forcibly copulate with them. The only serious, but anecdotal, report of such an incident taking place, is primatologist Birutė Galdikas' report that her cook was sexually assaulted by a male orangutan. This orangutan, though, was raised in captivity <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> suffered from a skewed species identity, and forced copulation is a standard mating strategy for low-ranking male orangutans.|$|E

5|$|After {{defeating}} Maxentius in 312, Constantine disbanded the Praetorian Guard, {{ending the}} latter's 300-year existence. Although the instant reason was the Guard's {{support for his}} rival Maxentius, a force based in Rome had also become obsolete since emperors now rarely resided there. The imperial escort role of the Guard's cavalry, the equites singulares Augusti, was now fulfilled by the scholae. These elite cavalry regiments existed {{by the time of}} Constantine <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been founded by Diocletian.|$|E
