Tubman sent word that he should join her, but he insisted that he was happy where he was. Tubman at first prepared to storm their house and make a scene, but then decided he was not worth the trouble.

500|$|The {{two ships}} then moved further {{up the river}} {{until they reached the}} town itself. All along the way they were harassed by musket and cannon fire from the shore, as the militia and their Indian allies {{positioned}} themselves to dispute possible landing sites. When darkness set in, the Indians reportedly began chanting and shouting in an attempt to magnify their numbers. At this point, [...] "To the great Surprise and Astonishment of every one in Less than half an Hour after Coming to an Anchor, the Brig & Sloop Both Gote under way without firing a Gun" [...] and [...] "made down the River against the Tide of flood." [...] The Hope, however, ran aground while making its way downstream in the twilight. The militia hauled a swivel gun to a nearby shore, and peppered her with shot the next morning before she was refloated by the tide <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> into Machias Bay.|$|E
500|$|Anderson {{informed}} the journalist Margot Adler {{that when he}} was nine years old he encountered a small old woman sitting in the centre of a circle containing brass bowls of herbs. He alleged that he instinctively stripped naked and that she then sexually initiated him into a witchcraft tradition, during which he had a vision of a goddess and a horned god. After the vision, he claimed that they sat in the circle and she instructed him in the magical use of the various herbs, after which he was washed in butter, oil, and salt, before putting his clothes on and returning home. The Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White described this as being [...] "difficult to accept as a literal account", but suggested that Anderson may have undergone a significant spiritual experience with an older woman in 1926, which was subsequently [...] "embellished into the later tale" [...] that he told Adler. A woman who knew Anderson, Cornelia Benavidez, later stated that [...] "He says that he became friends with a woman in the circus who was a fire dancer and when she got older worked the stands. She somehow joined the circus in South Africa <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> to the US. When he first met her she was 60 years old and he was a nine-year-old boy. He knew her for 15 years". Researcher WIlliam Wallworth provided potential supporting evidence for this claim when he noted that a number of the circuses that performed in Oregon during the 1920s and 1930s had Africans in their travelling retinues.|$|E

2500|$|Mary {{escaped from}} Lochleven <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> to England in May 1568. Her status was uncertain, {{as she had}} been accused of crimes and misrule. Elizabeth I of England ordered an inquiry into the {{question}} of whether Queen Mary should be tried for the murder of Darnley, as accused by the Scottish Lords who had deposed Queen Mary the year before. Moray came to England and showed the [...] "casket letters" [...] to Elizabeth's officers.|$|E
