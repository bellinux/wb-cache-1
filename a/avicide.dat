5|$|In the United States, common {{starlings}} {{are exempt}} from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which prohibits the taking or killing of migratory birds. No permit is required to remove nests and eggs or kill juveniles or adults. Research was undertaken in 1966 to identify a suitable <b>avicide</b> that would both kill common starlings and would readily be eaten by them. It also needed to be of low toxicity to mammals and not likely to cause the death of pets that ate dead birds. The chemical that best fitted these criteria was DRC-1339, now marketed as Starlicide. In 2008, the United States government poisoned, shot or trapped 1.7million birds, {{the largest number of}} any nuisance species to be destroyed. In 2005, the population in the United States was estimated at 140million birds, around 45% of the global total of 310million.|$|E

40|$|Many {{people are}} quite {{concerned}} {{and interested in}} the development of new <b>avicides</b> and in the continuation of existing ones. I think there are certain directions that the public at large expects industry and government to go in regards to control operations, pollution, and so forth. One of the things I think we need to concern our¬selves with is the fact that several biologically-oriented control mechanisms in control programs have been overlooked, sometimes intentionally. In the future, reg¬istration and regulatory groups are going to show more interest and a more amenable attitude toward biologically-oriented control programs, mechanism, and materials. Certainly there are many problems involved with the devel¬opment of these programs {{and some of them are}} not going to be at all practical. Some of the problems that are going to be involved within biologically-oriented control are more severe and more difficult to solve than are those problems connected with acute poisons. Nevertheless, I think the public is going to insist and demand that more research go in this direction. There will be continued research on acute poisons, but it will be downgraded; and, I am not too sure, but that an industry that has an in¬terest in developing and entering the field of <b>avicides</b> should consider the attitude of the public {{in the development of}} their research...|$|R
5000|$|It feeds {{primarily}} on seeds of annual grasses, but also causes extensive damage to cereal crops. Therefore, {{it is sometimes}} called [...] "Africa's feathered locust". The usual pest-control measures are spraying <b>avicides</b> or detonating fire-bombs in the enormous colonies during the night. Extensive control measures have been largely unsuccessful in limiting the quelea population. When food runs out, the species migrates to locations of recent rainfall and plentiful grass seed; hence it exploits its food source very efficiently. It {{is regarded as the}} most numerous undomesticated bird on earth, with the total post-breeding population sometimes peaking at an estimated 1½ billion individuals. It feeds in huge flocks of millions of individuals, with birds that run out of food at the rear flying over the entire group to a fresh feeding zone at the front, creating an image of a rolling cloud. The conservation status of red-billed quelea is least concern according to the IUCN Red List.|$|R

40|$|I was to {{come here}} and talk to you today about the status of strychnine. Strychnine, of course, is one of the older poisons in use today; and, {{according}} to information from Fitzwater, Strychnine was known for its toxic properties as early as 1640. It was used to destroy crows, pests, stray dogs, etc. Strychnine was also used by natives of South America and Africa to dispose of neighboring tribes. This material is derived from an extract of the seeds from strychnos nux vomica and other species of the strychnos genus. The alkaloid form is only slightly soluble in boiling water, about 1 g in 3100 ml H 2 O, but relatively soluble in alcohol, chloroform, and benzene. One gram Strychnine will dissolve in 150 ml alcohol and 35 ml boiling alcohol. One gram will dissolve in 5 ml chloroform or 180 ml of benzene. It’s only slightly soluble in ether. The present uses in this country are limited to rodenticides and <b>avicides.</b> The predacide uses were cancelled by EPA in March of 1972, based on the misuse with thallium as a predacide and the resulting deaths of an endangered species [...] bald eagles. However, since that time, EPA has issued specific exemptions to various states for the use of strychnine for the purpose of suppressing rabies in skunks...|$|R
40|$|There are six {{chemicals}} {{or groups}} of chemicals that are currently registered as <b>avicides</b> {{that can be used}} in some or all of the U. S. Most of these chemicals, because of their diverse chemical composition and innate toxicological effects, present somewhat different primary and secondary hazards to avian and mammalian predators and scavengers. Of the chemicals reviewed, all appear to present some degree of primary hazard to non-target birds and mammals; however, PA- 14, the Starlicide family of chemicals and fenthion appear to be the least hazardous when used according to use directions. 4 -Aminopyridine, endrin and strychnine, because of their high acute toxicity and lack of selectivity, must be considered potentially more hazardous. With respect to secondary hazards, the ranking of chemicals changes considerably and only PA- 14 appears to present a negligible hazard. The Starlicide family of chemicals presents negligible hazards to most animal species under currently registered uses, but may be potentially hazardous to cats and owls under specific use conditions. Two chemicals, 4 -aminopyridine and strychnine, are potentially more hazardous to predatory and scavenger animals due to their highly toxic nature and rapid lethal effects in target species, leaving unassimilated chemical in the gastrointestinal tract. The remaining chemicals, endrin and fenthion, have been shown to possess the potential for more significant secondary poisoning; however, because of restrictive uses, most of the potential hazards have been avoided in operational use...|$|R

40|$|In California Starlings are {{not only}} causing serious damage to many {{agricultural}} crops, but they are crowding out some of our native birds. In 1966 Decino, et al. found that a compound, DRC 1339 (CPT), was toxic to Starlings but not to mammals.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of 3 -chloro p-toluidine (DRC- 1339) as an <b>avicide,</b> particular¬ly on the European starling, has been adequately demonstrated (DeCino, Cunningham, and Schafer, 1966; Schwab, 1965, 1966, and 1967). Methods of applying the com¬pound which have proved useful {{range from the}} standard baiting technique (Besser, Royall, and DeGrazio, 1967; Royall, DeCino, and Besser, 1967; West, 1968) to pos¬sible aerial application of the compound to roosting sites (Schwab, 1967). These methods, particularly the latter, inherently lead to widespread environmental exposure. As the chemical name implies, DRC- 1339 is a chlorinated hydrocarbon. It thereby carries the stigma, whether justifiable or not, of environmental persistence and con¬centration at {{the upper end of}} the food chain (Rudd, 1966). Therefore, before the compound can be used as a widespread agent in bird control, its persistence and physical behavior in the ecosystem must be determined. Unlike many chlorinated hydrocarbons, 3 -chloro p-toluidine is water soluble within the range of biological effectiveness as an <b>avicide.</b> As a first step then, we have tested its stability in water when exposed to the common physical components of the environment.

S. D. I.) and since has been tested in various portions of the country by the Denver Center and other organizations, including the State of California. In California we are much impressed with this compound for a variety of reasons, particularly the specificity of it to birds, ease in handling, ease in formulation, and many other characteristics which make this a highly desirable <b>avicide.</b> This afternoon I 2 ̆ 7 m going to suggest that the European starling is more sus-ceptible to the compound DRC- 1339 at one time of the day than at another, and further that this phenomenon also has seasonal implications that the susceptibility of the starling to this compound varies seasonally.

40|$|Pest birds {{cause serious}} damage to {{agricultural}} crops in most situations {{only when the}} number of individuals is very high. Often, large populations of avian pest species spend the hours of darkness congregated in roosts where they become vulnerable to certain control methods. Such is the case in California where certain pest species, particularity starlings and blackbirds, can often be found roosting in cattail-tule marshes. From these relatively concentrated populations the birds disperse to cause in some, but not all, cases of serious damage to certain agricultural crops. The obvious disadvantage resulting from the tendency of these birds to concentrate in roosts is that the number of individuals often becomes extremely high and the resulting damage to local agricultural crops extensive. Conversely, the roost concentrations facilitate reduction of population size by application of an <b>avicide</b> on a roosting population. The major problem of reducing the numbers of bird pests occupying such roosts is centered in the selection of a suitable <b>avicide,</b> that is, an economically feasible compound which is as selective to the pest species as possible and which does not persist in, or contaminate the environment. Two likely candidate com-pounds for such use (based primarily on chemical characteristics which result in very low toxicity to mammals and some degree of avian selectivity) are 3 -chloro p-toluidine hydrochloride (coded DRC- 1339 by the Denver Research Center, U. S. D. I.) and the free base of this compound, 3 -chloro, 4 -methyl aniline (coded, I believe, DRC 1347).

40|$|We {{constructed}} bioenergetic {{models to}} assess the economic impact on sunflower production horn a regional population of blackbirds (Icteridae) consisting of three species: red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), common grackles (Quiscalus quiscula), and yellow-headed blackbirds (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus). Values generated from the bioenergetic models were used to perform a cost-benefit analysis to determine efficacy of a proposed <b>avicide</b> baiting program to manage red-winged blackbirds residing in the Central Lowlands and Northern Great Plains regions of North America. The bioenergetic model included metabolic rates, caloric value and moisture content of achenes, and percentage of sunflower in the diets {{of males and females}} of each species. The following estimates of annual sunflower consumption are per male and female, respectively: red-winged blackbird 265 g (9. 3 oz) and 159 g (5. 6 oz); common grackle, 257 g (9. 1 oz) and 220 g (7. 8 oz); and yellow-headed blackbird, 237 g (8. 4 oz) and 13 2 g (4. 6 oz). Based on the average price of sunflower horn 1993 - 1 997, male red-winged blackbirds damaged $ 0. 09 and $ 0. 18 (respective annual and lifetime damage per bird), females $ 0. 05 and $ 0. 21; male common grackles $ 0. 08 and $ 0. 12, females $ 0. 07 and $ 0. 22; and male yellow-headed blackbirds $ 0. 08 and $ 0. 15, females $ 0. 04 and $ 0. 14. The population of all three species combined impacted production by $ 5. 2 million, annually. Lifetime damage was $ 13. 3 million. The annual cost of baiting 2 million red-winged blackbirds with <b>avicide</b> would be $ 65, 000.

Individual variations in this response were captured in the model by Monte Carlo sampling from species-specific distributions of slopes and median toxicity values (LD 50) for each bird.

40|$|For several decades, {{blackbird}} depredation of sunflower {{has been}} a continuous problem. Sunflower growers consistently place blackbirds in the top tier of problems associated with growing sunflower in the northern Great Plains. Many non-lethal tactics have been employed {{in an attempt to}} protect ripening sunflower from foraging flocks of blackbirds. Thinning cattail-choked wetlands to reduce roosting habitat, using pyrotechniques to frighten feeding birds, planting Wildlife Conservation Sunflower Plots to lure birds away from commercial plots, applying taste repellents, and adapting cultural methods such as block planting to synchronize ripening are just a few such tactics. Even so, the numbers of blackbirds migrating through the northern Great Plains can overwhelm non-lethal techniques. That is, in some circumstances there are too many blackbirds for non-lethal techniques to be effective. One <b>avicide,</b> DRC- 1339, is registered for use as a lethal bait in the U. S. and North Dakota. The <b>avicide</b> is usually mixed with brown rice at a ratio of 1 : 25 (treated rice kernel to untreated rice kernels). Normally, the rice mixture is broadcast {{on the ground in the}} ripening or sprouting crop. Non-blackbirds are plentiful in ripening sunflower fields, causing a potential risk to these species with the use of DRC- 1339. These granivorous non-blackbirds might eat treated rice, causing an unintentional loss. A number of species of songbirds and sparrows could be at risk. Also, ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) and mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) are species of high concern. One potential method of avoiding non-blackbirds is to put live decoys (blackbirds) in cages in areas devoid of habitat to attract free-living blackbirds to bait trays attached to the top of the decoy cages. The intent is to reduce large concentrations of blackbirds that cannot be otherwise dispersed by non-lethal means. The objective of this study is to identify and quantify the avian species visiting the bait trays. Our goal is to develop an effective and environmentally-safe method for managing locally abundant blackbird populations...|$|E

The GC-MS method, which utilized deuterated CPTH as a surrogate, quantified CPTH residues in the breast tissue and gastrointestinal tract of CPTH-exposed birds. Comparison of these techniques indicated that the GC-MS method was more accurate for assessing CPTH poisoning in birds. Regression analyses of consumption versus residue data indicated that the sum of breast and gastrointestinal residues can be used as an estimator of CPTH exposure. Comparison of CPTH residues in grackles with toxicity data for a variety of scavenger and predator species provided risk quotients of less than 0. 1.

40|$|Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) {{became an}} {{economically}} important crop in North Dakota in the 1970 s, providing {{a major source}} of food for post-breeding blackbirds (Icteridae). Reducing local blackbird populations with rice grains treated with an <b>avicide</b> is one proposed alternative for reducing sunflower damage. In fall 2007 and 2008, we evaluated the idea of attracting blackbirds to rice-baited trays attached to wire cages supplied with live blackbirds.

Blackbirds made up 90. 4 % of the bird observations, whereas sparrows (Emberizidae) made up 1. 6 % of the birds observed. Overall risk to nontarget species appeared minimal.
