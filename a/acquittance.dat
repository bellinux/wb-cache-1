The subjects who had been supported by <b>acquittances</b> have more significant social support index. The quality of life has significant differences in number of admissions, gender and occupation.

5000|$|War crimes {{witnesses}} to the Kosovo War (1998-99) have been victims to threats, violence, and murder. Those who spoke out about the abuses of their side in the conflict were seen as traitors to their community, and therefore, only a few became witnesses in war crime trials. The international institutions ICTY, UNMIK and EULEX, and national courts in Serbia and Kosovo, have all had problems in ensuring safety for testifying protected witnesses. According to observers, {{one of the main}} reasons that the Kosovo Relocated Specialist Judicial Institution will partly operate outside Kosovo is the past failures of the international institutions to protect witnesses. According to Carla Del Ponte, the former ICTY prosecutor, [...] "the investigation of the Kosovo Liberation Army fighters appeared to be the most frustrating of all the investigations done by the ICTY", and stated [...] "witnesses were so afraid and intimidated that they even feared to talk about the KLA presence in some areas, not to mention actual crimes". She further stated that [...] "I am convinced that UNMIK and even KFOR officers were afraid for their lives and the lives of their missions’ members. I think some of the ICTY judges were afraid that they would become a target for the Albanians" [...] and believes that witness intimidation seriously affected the acquitting verdicts against KLA officials Fatmir Limaj and Ramush Haradinaj. Numerous witnesses did change their testimonies during trials, while others were killed or mysteriously disappeared. Avni Zogiani, leader of an anti-corruption nongovernmental organization in Kosovo, said [...] "Intimidation and even killings of witnesses are nothing new or shocking in Kosovo". EULEX prosecutor Charles Hardaway said that [...] "Witness intimidation, not only in war crimes but in other cases too, is happening from people with high competencies in government who are powerful". According to Belgian author Jelle Janssens, it was reported that judges and prosecutors became terrified at the mention of high-ranking KLA officers or politicians in case files. Del Ponte asserts that there were serious abuses of witnesses in Kosovo local criminal proceedings, and also alleged that UNMIK leaked sensitive information about {{witnesses to}} defendants, which UNMIK denied but later admitted that it had stopped some investigations into high-level perpetrators due to political reasons. The Humanitarian Law Center concluded that a large number of <b>acquittances</b> were due to witnesses changing their stories, suspecting intimidation.|$|R

He well knows the ways of falsifying the Company's accounts; he well knows the necessities of the natives, and he knows that by paying a part of their dues they will be ready to give an <b>acquittance</b> of the whole.

We know, that, if the paymaster should deny himself the advantages of his bank, the public, as things stand, is not the richer for it by a single shilling. This I thought it necessary to say as to the offensive magnitude of the profits of this office, that we may proceed in reformation on the principles of reason, and not on the feelings of envy.|$|E
60|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} of these projected reforms, and one which its author did not flinch from carrying out two years later to his own loss, related to the office of Paymaster. This functionary was accustomed to hold large balances of the public money in his own hands and for his own profit, for long periods, owing to a complex system of accounts which was so rigorous as entirely to defeat its own object. The paymaster could not, through the multiplicity of forms and the exaction of impossible conditions, get a prompt <b>acquittance.</b> The audit sometimes did not take place for years after the accounts were virtually closed. Meanwhile the money accumulated in his hands, and its profits were his legitimate perquisite. Lord Holland, or his representatives, held the balances of his office from 1765, when he retired, until 1778, when they were audited. During this time he realised, as the interest on the use of these balances, nearly two hundred and fifty thousand pounds. Burke diverted these enormous gains into the coffers of the State. He fixed the paymaster's salary at four thousand pounds a year, and was himself the first person who accepted the curtailed income.|$|E

[...] Friedrich found that he must at once step in with active remedies, and on all hands strive to make the impossible possible. Luckily he had in readiness, as usual, the funds for an Eighth Campaign, had such been needed. Out of these moneys he proceeded to rebuild the Towns and Villages; [...] "from the Corn-Stores (GRANARIES D'ABONDANCE," [...] Government establishments gathered from plentiful harvests against scarce, according to old rule) [...] "were taken the supplies for food of the people and sowing of the ground: the horses intended for the artillery, baggage and commissariat," [...] 60,000 horses we have heard, [...] "were distributed among those who had none, to be employed in tillage of the land. Silesia was discharged from all taxes for six months; Pommern and the Neumark for two years.

60|$|As {{the extent}} of our wars has {{scattered}} the accountants under the paymaster into {{every part of the}} globe, the grand and sure paymaster, Death, in all his shapes, calls these accountants to another reckoning. Death, indeed, domineers over everything but the forms of the Exchequer. Over these he has no power. They are impassive and immortal. The audit of the Exchequer, more severe than the audit to which the accountants are gone, demands proofs which in the nature of things are difficult, sometimes impossible, to be had. In this respect, too, rigor, as usual, defeats itself. Then the Exchequer never gives a particular receipt, or clears a man of his account as far as it goes. A final <b>acquittance</b> (or a quietus, as they term it) is scarcely ever to be obtained. Terrors and ghosts of unlaid accountants haunt the houses of their children from generation to generation. Families, in the course of succession, fall into minorities; the inheritance comes into the hands of females; and very perplexed affairs are often delivered over into the hands of negligent guardians and faithless stewards. So that the demand remains, when the advantage of the money is gone,--if ever any advantage at all has been made of it. This is a cause of infinite distress to families, and becomes a source of influence to an extent that can scarcely be imagined, but by those who have taken some pains to trace it. The mildness of government, in the employment of useless and dangerous powers, furnishes no reason for their continuance.|$|E
60|$|The Honourable Mrs Skewton, who was {{thinking}} of anything rather than of such sentiments--for, like many genteel persons who have existed at various times, she set her face against death altogether, and objected to the mention of any such low and levelling upstart--had borrowed a house in Brook Street, Grosvenor Square, from a stately relative (one of the Feenix brood), who was out of town, and who did not object to lending it, in the handsomest manner, for nuptial purposes, as the loan implied his final release and <b>acquittance</b> from all further loans and gifts to Mrs Skewton and her daughter. It being necessary for the credit of the family to make a handsome appearance at such a time, Mrs Skewton, {{with the assistance of}} an accommodating tradesman resident In the parish of Mary-le-bone, who lent out all sorts of articles to the nobility and gentry, from a service of plate to an army of footmen, clapped into this house a silver-headed butler (who was charged extra on that account, as having the appearance of an ancient family retainer), two very tall young men in livery, and a select staff of kitchen-servants; so that a legend arose, downstairs, that Withers the page, released at once from his numerous household duties, and from the propulsion of the wheeled-chair (inconsistent with the metropolis), had been several times observed to rub his eyes and pinch his limbs, as if he misdoubted his having overslept himself at the Leamington milkman's, and being still in a celestial dream. A variety of requisites in plate and china being also conveyed to the same establishment from the same convenient source, with several miscellaneous articles, including a neat chariot and a pair of bays, Mrs Skewton cushioned herself on the principal sofa, in the Cleopatra attitude, and held her court in fair state.|$|E
60|$|These are {{the most}} {{material}} of the Constitutions or Assizes of Clarendon, famous for having been the first legal check given {{to the power of}} the clergy in England. To give these constitutions the greater weight, it was thought proper that they should be confirmed by a bull from the Pope. By this step the king seemed to doubt the entireness of his own authority in his dominions; and by calling in foreign aid when it served his purpose, he gave it a force and a sort of legal sanction when it came to be employed against himself. But as no negotiation had prepared the Pope in favor of laws designed in reality to abridge his own power, it was no wonder that he rejected them with indignation. Becket, who had not been prevailed on to accept them but with infinite reluctance, was no sooner apprised of the Pope's disapprobation than he openly declared his own; he did penance in the humblest manner for his former acquiescence, and resolved to make amends for it by opposing the new constitutions with the utmost zeal. In this disposition the king saw that the Archbishop might be more easily ruined than humbled, and his ruin was resolved. Immediately a number of suits, on various pretences, were commenced against him, in every one of which he was sure to be foiled; but these making no deadly blow at his fortunes, he was called to account for thirty thousand pounds which he was accused of having embezzled during his chancellorship. It was in vain that he pleaded a full <b>acquittance</b> from the king's son, and Richard de Lucy, the guardian and justiciary of the kingdom, on his resignation of the seals; he saw it was already determined against him. Far from yielding under these repeated blows, he raised still higher the ecclesiastical pretensions, now become necessary to his own protection. He refused to answer to the charge, and appealed to the Pope, to whom alone he seemed to acknowledge any real subjection. A great ferment ensued on this appeal. The courtiers advised that he should be thrown into prison, and that his temporalities should be seized. The bishops, willing to reduce Becket without reducing their own order, proposed to accuse him before the Pope, and to pursue him to degradation. Some of his friends pressed him to give up his cause; others urged him to resign his dignity. The king's servants threw out menaces against his life. Amidst this general confusion of passions and councils, whilst every one according to his interests expected the event with much anxiety, Becket, in the disguise of a monk, escaped out of the nation, and threw himself into the arms of the King of France.|$|E

[...] Meanwhile ere thus was sin'd and judg'd on Earth, [...] Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death, [...] 230 [...] In counterview within the Gates, that now [...] Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame [...] Farr into Chaos, since the Fiend pass'd through, [...] Sin opening, who thus now to Death began. [...] O Son, why sit we here each other viewing [...] Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives [...] In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides [...] For us his ofspring deare? It cannot be [...] But that success attends him; if mishap, [...] Ere this he had return'd, with fury driv'n [...] 240 [...] By his Avenger, since no place like this [...] Can fit his punishment, or their revenge. [...] Methinks I feel new strength within me rise, [...] Wings growing, and Dominion giv'n me large [...] Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on, [...] Or sympathie, or som connatural force [...] Powerful at greatest distance to unite [...] With secret amity things of like kinde [...] By secretest conveyance. Thou my Shade [...] Inseparable must with mee along: [...] 250 [...] For Death from Sin no power can separate. [...] But least the difficultie of passing back [...] Stay his returne perhaps over this Gulfe [...] Impassable, impervious, let us try [...] Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine [...] Not unagreeable, to found a path [...] Over this Maine from Hell to that new World [...] Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument [...] Of merit high to all th' infernal Host, [...] Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse, [...] 260 [...] Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead. [...] Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn [...] By this new felt attraction and instinct. [...] Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon. [...] Goe whither Fate and inclination strong [...] Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre [...] The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw [...] Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste [...] The savour of Death from all things there that live: [...] Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest [...] 270 [...] Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. [...] So saying, with delight he snuff'd the smell [...] Of mortal change on Earth. As when a flock [...] Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote, [...] Against the day of Battel, to a Field, [...] Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur'd [...] With sent of living Carcasses design'd [...] For death, the following day, in bloodie fight. [...] So sented the grim Feature, and upturn'd [...] His Nostril wide into the murkie Air, [...] 280 [...] Sagacious of his Quarrey from so farr. [...] Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste [...] Wide Anarchie of Chaos damp and dark [...] Flew divers, & with Power (thir Power was great) [...] Hovering upon the Waters; what they met [...] Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea [...] Tost up and down, together crowded drove [...] From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell. [...] As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse [...] Upon the Cronian Sea, together drive [...] 290 [...] Mountains of Ice, that stop th' imagin'd way [...] Beyond Petsora Eastward, to the rich [...] Cathaian Coast. The aggregated Soyle [...] Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry, [...] As with a Trident smote, and fix't as firm [...] As Delos floating once; the rest his look [...] Bound with Gorgonian rigor not to move, [...] And with Asphaltic slime; broad as the Gate, [...] Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather'd beach [...] They fasten'd, and the Mole immense wraught on [...] 300 [...] Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge [...] Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall [...] Immoveable of this now fenceless world [...] Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, [...] Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell. [...] So, if great things to small may be compar'd, [...] Xerxes, the Libertie of Greece to yoke, [...] From Susa his Memnonian Palace high [...] Came to the Sea, and over Hellespont [...] Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joyn'd, [...] 310 [...] And scourg'd with many a stroak th' indignant waves. [...] Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art [...] Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock [...] Over the vext Abyss, following the track [...] Of Satan, to the selfsame place where hee [...] First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe [...] From out of Chaos to the outside bare [...] Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant [...] And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made [...] And durable; and now in little space [...] 320 [...] The Confines met of Empyrean Heav'n [...] And of this World, and on the left hand Hell [...] With long reach interpos'd; three sev'ral wayes [...] In sight, to each of these three places led. [...] And now thir way to Earth they had descri'd, [...] To Paradise first tending, when behold [...] Satan in likeness of an Angel bright [...] Betwixt the Centaure and the Scorpion stearing [...] His Zenith, while the Sun in Aries rose: [...] Disguis'd he came, but those his Children dear [...] 330 [...] Thir Parent soon discern'd, though in disguise. [...] Hee, after Eve seduc't, unminded slunk [...] Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape [...] To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act [...] By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded [...] Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought [...] Vain covertures; but when he saw descend [...] The Son of God to judge them, terrifi'd [...] Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun [...] The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth [...] 340 [...] Might suddenly inflict; that past, return'd [...] By Night, and listning where the hapless Paire [...] Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint, [...] Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood [...] Not instant, but of future time. With joy [...] And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return'd, [...] And at the brink of Chaos, neer the foot [...] Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop't [...] Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear. [...] Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight [...] 350 [...] Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas'd. [...] Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire [...] Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke. [...] O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds, [...] Thy Trophies, which thou view'st as not thine own, [...] Thou art thir Author and prime Architect: [...] For I no sooner in my Heart divin'd, [...] My Heart, which by a secret harmonie [...] Still moves with thine, joyn'd in connexion sweet, [...] That thou on Earth hadst prosper'd, which thy looks [...] 360 [...] Now also evidence, but straight I felt [...] Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt [...] That I must after thee with this thy Son; [...] Such fatal consequence unites us three: [...] Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds, [...] Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure [...] Detain from following thy illustrious track. [...] Thou hast atchiev'd our libertie, confin'd [...] Within Hell Gates till now, thou us impow'rd [...] To fortifie thus farr, and overlay [...] 370 [...] With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss. [...] Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won [...] What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain'd [...] With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng'd [...] Our foile in Heav'n; here thou shalt Monarch reign, [...] There didst not; there let him still Victor sway, [...] As Battel hath adjudg'd, from this new World [...] Retiring, by his own doom alienated, [...] And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide [...] Of all things, parted by th' Empyreal bounds, [...] 380 [...] His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World, [...] Or trie thee now more dang'rous to his Throne. [...] Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad. [...] Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both, [...] High proof ye now have giv'n to be the Race [...] Of Satan (for I glorie in the name, [...] Antagonist of Heav'ns Almightie King) [...] Amply have merited of me, of all [...] Th' Infernal Empire, that so neer Heav'ns dore [...] Triumphal with triumphal act have met, [...] 390 [...] Mine with this glorious Work, & made one Realm [...] Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent [...] Of easie thorough-fare. Therefore while I [...] Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease [...] To my associate Powers, them to acquaint [...] With these successes, and with them rejoyce, [...] You two this way, among those numerous Orbs [...] All yours, right down to Paradise descend; [...] There dwell & Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth [...] Dominion exercise and in the Aire, [...] 400 [...] Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar'd, [...] Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. [...] My Substitutes I send ye, and Create [...] Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might [...] Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now [...] My hold of this new Kingdom all depends, [...] Through Sin to Death expos'd by my exploit. [...] If your joynt power prevaile, th' affaires of Hell [...] No detriment need feare, goe and be strong. [...] So saying he dismiss'd them, they with speed [...] 410 [...] Thir course through thickest Constellations held [...] Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan, [...] And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips [...] Then sufferd. Th' other way Satan went down [...] The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side [...] Disparted Chaos over built exclaimd, [...] And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild, [...] That scorn'd his indignation: through the Gate, [...] Wide open and unguarded, Satan pass'd, [...] And all about found desolate; for those [...] 420 [...] Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge, [...] Flown to the upper World; the rest were all [...] Farr to the inland retir'd, about the walls [...] Of Pandemonium, Citie and proud seate [...] Of Lucifer, so by allusion calld, [...] Of that bright Starr to Satan paragond. [...] There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand [...] In Council sate, sollicitous what chance [...] Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee [...] Departing gave command, and they observ'd. [...] 430 [...] As when the Tartar from his Russian Foe [...] By Astracan over the Snowie Plaines [...] Retires, or Bactrian Sophi from the hornes [...] Of Turkish Crescent, leaves all waste beyond [...] The Realme of Aladule, in his retreate [...] To Tauris or Casbeen. So these the late [...] Heav'n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell [...] Many a dark League, reduc't in careful Watch [...] Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting [...] Each hour their great adventurer from the search [...] 440 [...] Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt, [...] In shew plebeian Angel militant [...] Of lowest order, past; and from the dore [...] Of that Plutonian Hall, invisible [...] Ascended his high Throne, which under state [...] Of richest texture spred, at th' upper end [...] Was plac't in regal lustre. Down a while [...] He sate, and round about him saw unseen: [...] At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head [...] And shape Starr bright appeer'd, or brighter, clad [...] 450 [...] With what permissive glory since his fall [...] Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz'd [...] At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng [...] Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish'd beheld, [...] Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th' acclaime: [...] Forth rush'd in haste the great consulting Peers, [...] Rais'd from thir dark Divan, and with like joy [...] Congratulant approach'd him, who with hand [...] Silence, and with these words attention won. [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, [...] 460 [...] For in possession such, not onely of right, [...] I call ye and declare ye now, returnd [...] Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth [...] Triumphant out of this infernal Pit [...] Abominable, accurst, the house of woe, [...] And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess, [...] As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven [...] Little inferiour, by my adventure hard [...] With peril great atchiev'd. Long were to tell [...] What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine [...] 470 [...] Voyag'd the unreal, vast, unbounded deep [...] Of horrible confusion, over which [...] By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav'd [...] To expedite your glorious march; but I [...] Toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride [...] Th' untractable Abysse, plung'd in the womb [...] Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wilde, [...] That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd [...] My journey strange, with clamorous uproare [...] Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found [...] 480 [...] The new created World, which fame in Heav'n [...] Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful [...] Of absolute perfection, therein Man [...] Plac't in a Paradise, by our exile [...] Made happie: Him by fraud I have seduc'd [...] From his Creator, and the more to increase [...] Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat [...] Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up [...] Both his beloved Man and all his World, [...] To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us, [...] 490 [...] Without our hazard, labour or allarme, [...] To range in, and to dwell, and over Man [...] To rule, as over all he should have rul'd. [...] True is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather [...] Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape [...] Man I deceav'd: that which to mee belongs, [...] Is enmity, which he will put between [...] Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel; [...] His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: [...] A World who would not purchase with a bruise, [...] 500 [...] Or much more grievous pain? Ye have th' account [...] Of my performance: What remaines, ye Gods, [...] But up and enter now into full bliss. [...] So having said, a while he stood, expecting [...] Thir universal shout and high applause [...] To fill his eare, when contrary he hears [...] On all sides, from innumerable tongues [...] A dismal universal hiss, the sound [...] Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long [...] Had leasure, wondring at himself now more; [...] 510 [...] His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare, [...] His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining [...] Each other, till supplanted down he fell [...] A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone, [...] Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power [...] Now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd, [...] According to his doom: he would have spoke, [...] But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue [...] To forked tongue, for now were all transform'd [...] Alike, to Serpents all as accessories [...] 520 [...] To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din [...] Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now [...] With complicated monsters, head and taile, [...] Scorpion and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire, [...] Cerastes hornd, Hydrus, and Ellops drear, [...] And Dipsas (Not so thick swarm'd once the Soil [...] Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle [...] Ophiusa) but still greatest hee the midst, [...] Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun [...] Ingenderd in the Pythian Vale on slime, [...] 530 [...] Huge Python, and his Power no less he seem'd [...] Above the rest still to retain; they all [...] Him follow'd issuing forth to th' open Field, [...] Where all yet left of that revolted Rout [...] Heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array, [...] Sublime with expectation when to see [...] In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief; [...] They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd [...] Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell, [...] And horrid sympathie; for what they saw, [...] 540 [...] They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms, [...] Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast, [...] And the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form [...] Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment, [...] As in thir crime. Thus was th' applause they meant, [...] Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame [...] Cast on themselves from thir own mouths. There stood [...] A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change, [...] His will who reigns above, to aggravate [...] Thir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that [...] 550 [...] Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve [...] Us'd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange [...] Thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining [...] For one forbidden Tree a multitude [...] Now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame; [...] Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce, [...] Though to delude them sent, could not abstain, [...] But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees [...] Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks [...] That curld Megaera: greedily they pluck'd [...] 560 [...] The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew [...] Neer that bituminous Lake where Sodom flam'd; [...] This more delusive, not the touch, but taste [...] Deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay [...] Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit [...] Chewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste [...] With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd, [...] Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft, [...] With hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws [...] With foot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell [...] 570 [...] Into the same illusion, not as Man [...] Whom they triumph'd once lapst. Thus were they plagu'd [...] And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss, [...] Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd, [...] Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo [...] This annual humbling certain number'd days, [...] To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't. [...] However some tradition they dispers'd [...] Among the Heathen of thir purchase got, [...] And Fabl'd how the Serpent, whom they calld [...] 580 [...] Ophion with Eurynome, the wide- [...] Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule [...] Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driv'n [...] And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born. [...] Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair [...] Too soon arriv'd, Sin there in power before, [...] Once actual, now in body, and to dwell [...] Habitual habitant; behind her Death [...] Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet [...] On his pale Horse: to whom Sin thus began. [...] 590 [...] Second of Satan sprung, all conquering Death, [...] What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd [...] With travail difficult, not better farr [...] Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch, [...] Unnam'd, undreaded, and thy self half starv'd? [...] Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon. [...] To mee, who with eternal Famin pine, [...] Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven, [...] There best, where most with ravin I may meet; [...] Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems [...] 600 [...] To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps. [...] To whom th' incestuous Mother thus repli'd. [...] Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, & Flours [...] Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle, [...] No homely morsels, and whatever thing [...] The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar'd, [...] Till I in Man residing through the Race, [...] His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect, [...] And season him thy last and sweetest prey. [...] This said, they both betook them several wayes, [...] 610 [...] Both to destroy, or unimmortal make [...] All kinds, and for destruction to mature [...] Sooner or later; which th' Almightie seeing, [...] From his transcendent Seat the Saints among, [...] To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice. [...] See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance [...] To waste and havoc yonder World, which I [...] So fair and good created, and had still [...] Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man [...] Let in these wastful Furies, who impute [...] 620 [...] Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell [...] And his Adherents, that with so much ease [...] I suffer them to enter and possess [...] A place so heav'nly, and conniving seem [...] To gratifie my scornful Enemies, [...] That laugh, as if transported with some fit [...] Of Passion, I to them had quitted all, [...] At random yeilded up to their misrule; [...] And know not that I call'd and drew them thither [...] My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth [...] 630 [...] Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed [...] On what was pure, till cramm'd and gorg'd, nigh burst [...] With suckt and glutted offal, at one fling [...] Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son, [...] Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave at last [...] Through Chaos hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell [...] For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes. [...] Then Heav'n and Earth renewd shall be made pure [...] To sanctitie that shall receive no staine: [...] Till then the Curse pronounc't on both precedes. [...] 640 [...] Hee ended, and the heav'nly Audience loud [...] Sung Halleluia, as the sound of Seas, [...] Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways, [...] Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works; [...] Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son, [...] Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom [...] New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise, [...] Or down from Heav'n descend. Such was thir song, [...] While the Creator calling forth by name [...] His mightie Angels gave them several charge, [...] 650 [...] As sorted best with present things. The Sun [...] Had first his precept so to move, so shine, [...] As might affect the Earth with cold and heat [...] Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call [...] Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring [...] Solstitial summers heat. To the blanc Moone [...] Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five [...] Thir planetarie motions and aspects [...] In Sextile, Square, and Trine, and Opposite, [...] Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne [...] 660 [...] In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt [...] Thir influence malignant when to showre, [...] Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling, [...] Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set [...] Thir corners, when with bluster to confound [...] Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle [...] With terror through the dark Aereal Hall. [...] Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse [...] The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more [...] From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd [...] 670 [...] Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun [...] Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode [...] Like distant breadth to Taurus with the Seav'n [...] Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins [...] Up to the Tropic Crab; thence down amaine [...] By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales, [...] As deep as Capricorne, to bring in change [...] Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring [...] Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours, [...] Equal in Days and Nights, except to those [...] 680 [...] Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day [...] Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun [...] To recompence his distance, in thir sight [...] Had rounded still th' Horizon, and not known [...] Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow [...] From cold Estotiland, and South as farr [...] Beneath Magellan. At that tasted Fruit [...] The Sun, as from Thyestean Banquet, turn'd [...] His course intended; else how had the World [...] Inhabited, though sinless, more then now, [...] 690 [...] Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate? [...] These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd [...] Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast, [...] Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot, [...] Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North [...] Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shoar [...] Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice [...] And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw, [...] Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud [...] And Thrascias rend the Woods and Seas upturn; [...] 700 [...] With adverse blast up-turns them from the South [...] Notus and Afer black with thundrous Clouds [...] From Serraliona; thwart of these as fierce [...] Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent Windes [...] Eurus and Zephir with thir lateral noise, [...] Sirocco, and Libecchio. Thus began [...] Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first [...] Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational, [...] Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie: [...] Beast now with Beast gan war, & Fowle with Fowle, [...] 710 [...] And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving, [...] Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe [...] Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim [...] Glar'd on him passing: these were from without [...] The growing miseries, which Adam saw [...] Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, [...] To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within, [...] And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost, [...] Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint. [...] O miserable of happie! is this the end [...] 720 [...] Of this new glorious World, and mee so late [...] The Glory of that Glory, who now becom [...] Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face [...] Of God, whom to behold was then my highth [...] Of happiness: yet well, if here would end [...] The miserie, I deserv'd it, and would beare [...] My own deservings; but this will not serve; [...] All that I eate or drink, or shall beget, [...] Is propagated curse. O voice once heard [...] Delightfully, Encrease And Multiply, [...] 730 [...] Now death to heare! for what can I encrease [...] Or multiplie, but curses on my head? [...] Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling [...] The evil on him brought by me, will curse [...] My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure, [...] For this we may thank Adam; but his thanks [...] Shall be the execration; so besides [...] Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee [...] Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound, [...] On mee as on thir natural center light [...] 740 [...] Heavie, though in thir place. O fleeting joyes [...] Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes! [...] Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay [...] To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee [...] From darkness to promote me, or here place [...] In this delicious Garden? as my Will [...] Concurd not to my being, it were but right [...] And equal to reduce me to my dust, [...] Desirous to resigne, and render back [...] All I receav'd, unable to performe [...] 750 [...] Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold [...] The good I sought not. To the loss of that, [...] Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added [...] The sense of endless woes? inexplicable [...] Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late, [...] I thus contest; then should have been refusd [...] Those terms whatever, when they were propos'd: [...] Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good, [...] Then cavil the conditions? and though God [...] Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son [...] 760 [...] Prove disobedient, and reprov'd, retort, [...] Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not: [...] Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee [...] That proud excuse? yet him not thy election, [...] But Natural necessity begot. [...] God made thee of choice his own, and of his own [...] To serve him, thy reward was of his grace, [...] Thy punishment then justly is at his Will. [...] Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair, [...] That dust I am, and shall to dust returne: [...] 770 [...] O welcom hour whenever! why delayes [...] His hand to execute what his Decree [...] Fixd on this day? why do I overlive, [...] Why am I mockt with death, and length'nd out [...] To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet [...] Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth [...] Insensible, how glad would lay me down [...] As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest [...] And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more [...] Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse [...] 780 [...] To mee and to my ofspring would torment me [...] With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt [...] Pursues me still, least all I cannot die, [...] Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man [...] Which God inspir'd, cannot together perish [...] With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave, [...] Or in some other dismal place, who knows [...] But I shall die a living Death? O thought [...] Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath [...] Of Life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life [...] 790 [...] And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither. [...] All of me then shall die: let this appease [...] The doubt, since humane reach no further knows. [...] For though the Lord of all be infinite, [...] Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so, [...] But mortal doom'd. How can he exercise [...] Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end? [...] Can he make deathless Death? that were to make [...] Strange contradiction, which to God himself [...] Impossible is held, as Argument [...] 800 [...] Of weakness, not of Power. Will he, draw out, [...] For angers sake, finite to infinite [...] In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour [...] Satisfi'd never; that were to extend [...] His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law, [...] By which all Causes else according still [...] To the reception of thir matter act, [...] Not to th' extent of thir own Spheare. But say [...] That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos'd, [...] Bereaving sense, but endless miserie [...] 810 [...] From this day onward, which I feel begun [...] Both in me, and without me, and so last [...] To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear [...] Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution [...] On my defensless head; both Death and I [...] Am found Eternal, and incorporate both, [...] Nor I on my part single, in mee all [...] Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie [...] That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able [...] To waste it all my self, and leave ye none! [...] 820 [...] So disinherited how would ye bless [...] Me now your Curse! Ah, why should all mankind [...] For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn'd, [...] If guiltless? But from mee what can proceed, [...] But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav'd, [...] Not to do onely, but to will the same [...] With me? how can they acquitted stand [...] In sight of God? Him after all Disputes [...] Forc't I absolve: all my evasions vain [...] And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still [...] 830 [...] But to my own conviction: first and last [...] On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring [...] Of all corruption, all the blame lights due; [...] So might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support [...] That burden heavier then the Earth to bear, [...] Then all the world much heavier, though divided [...] With that bad Woman? Thus what thou desir'st, [...] And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope [...] Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable [...] Beyond all past example and future, [...] 840 [...] To Satan onely like both crime and doom. [...] O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears [...] And horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which [...] I find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd! [...] Thus Adam to himself lamented loud [...] Through the still Night, now now, as ere man fell, [...] Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air [...] Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom, [...] Which to his evil Conscience represented [...] All things with double terror: On the ground [...] 850 [...] Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft [...] Curs'd his Creation, Death as oft accus'd [...] Of tardie execution, since denounc't [...] The day of his offence. Why comes not Death, [...] Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke [...] To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word, [...] Justice Divine not hast'n to be just? [...] But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine [...] Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries. [...] O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs, [...] 860 [...] With other echo farr I taught your Shades [...] To answer, and resound farr other Song. [...] Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld, [...] Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh, [...] Soft words to his fierce passion she assay'd: [...] But her with stern regard he thus repell'd. [...] Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best [...] Befits thee with him leagu'd, thy self as false [...] And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, [...] Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew [...] 870 [...] Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee [...] Henceforth; least that too heav'nly form, pretended [...] To hellish falshood, snare them.

O why did God, [...] Creator wise, that peopl'd highest Heav'n [...] With Spirits Masculine, create at last [...] 890 [...] This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect [...] Of Nature, and not fill the World at once [...] With Men as Angels without Feminine, [...] Or find some other way to generate [...] Mankind? this mischief had not then befall'n, [...] And more that shall befall, innumerable [...] Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares, [...] And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either [...] He never shall find out fit Mate, but such [...] As some misfortune brings him, or mistake, [...] 900 [...] Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain [...] Through her perverseness, but shall see her gaind [...] By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld [...] By Parents, or his happiest choice too late [...] Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound [...] To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame: [...] Which infinite calamitie shall cause [...] To humane life, and houshold peace confound.

[...] Forsake me not thus, Adam, witness Heav'n [...] What love sincere, and reverence in my heart [...] I beare thee, and unweeting have offended, [...] Unhappilie deceav'd; thy suppliant [...] I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, [...] Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, [...] Thy counsel in this uttermost distress, [...] 920 [...] My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee, [...] Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? [...] While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps, [...] Between us two let there be peace, both joyning, [...] As joyn'd in injuries, one enmitie [...] Against a Foe by doom express assign'd us, [...] That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not [...] Thy hatred for this miserie befall'n, [...] On me already lost, mee then thy self [...] More miserable; both have sin'd, but thou [...] 930 [...] Against God onely, I against God and thee, [...] And to the place of judgement will return, [...] There with my cries importune Heaven, that all [...] The sentence from thy head remov'd may light [...] On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe, [...] Mee mee onely just object of his ire. [...] She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight, [...] Immoveable till peace obtain'd from fault [...] Acknowledg'd and deplor'd, in Adam wraught [...] Commiseration; soon his heart relented [...] 940 [...] Towards her, his life so late and sole delight, [...] Now at his feet submissive in distress, [...] Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking, [...] His counsel whom she had displeas'd, his aide; [...] As one disarm'd, his anger all he lost, [...] And thus with peaceful words uprais'd her soon. [...] Unwarie, and too desirous, as before, [...] So now of what thou knowst not, who desir'st [...] The punishment all on thy self; alas, [...] Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine [...] 950 [...] His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part, [...] And my displeasure bearst so ill. If Prayers [...] Could alter high Decrees, I to that place [...] Would speed before thee, and be louder heard, [...] That on my head all might be visited, [...] Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv'n, [...] To me committed and by me expos'd. [...] But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame [...] Each other, blam'd enough elsewhere, but strive [...] In offices of Love, how we may light'n [...] 960 [...] Each others burden in our share of woe; [...] Since this days Death denounc't, if ought I see, [...] Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac't evill, [...] A long days dying to augment our paine, [...] And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv'd. [...] To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, repli'd. [...] Adam, by sad experiment I know [...] How little weight my words with thee can finde, [...] Found so erroneous, thence by just event [...] Found so unfortunate; nevertheless, [...] 970 [...] Restor'd by thee, vile as I am, to place [...] Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine [...] Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart, [...] Living or dying from thee I will not hide [...] What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n, [...] Tending to som relief of our extremes, [...] Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, [...] As in our evils, and of easier choice. [...] If care of our descent perplex us most, [...] Which must be born to certain woe, devourd [...] 980 [...] By Death at last, and miserable it is [...] To be to others cause of misery, [...] Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring [...] Into this cursed World a woful Race, [...] That after wretched Life must be at last [...] Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power [...] It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent [...] The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot. [...] Childless thou art, Childless remaine: [...] So Death shall be deceav'd his glut, and with us two [...] 990 [...] Be forc'd to satisfie his Rav'nous Maw. [...] But if thou judge it hard and difficult, [...] Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain [...] From Loves due Rites, Nuptial embraces sweet, [...] And with desire to languish without hope, [...] Before the present object languishing [...] With like desire, which would be miserie [...] And torment less then none of what we dread, [...] Then both our selves and Seed at once to free [...] From what we fear for both, let us make short, [...] 1000 [...] Let us seek Death, or hee not found, supply [...] With our own hands his Office on our selves; [...] Why stand we longer shivering under feares, [...] That shew no end but Death, and have the power, [...] Of many wayes to die the shortest choosing, [...] Destruction with destruction to destroy. [...] She ended heer, or vehement despaire [...] Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts [...] Had entertaind, as di'd her Cheeks with pale. [...] But Adam with such counsel nothing sway'd, [...] 1010 [...] To better hopes his more attentive minde [...] Labouring had rais'd, and thus to Eve repli'd. [...] Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems [...] To argue in thee somthing more sublime [...] And excellent then what thy minde contemnes; [...] But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes [...] That excellence thought in thee, and implies, [...] Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret [...] For loss of life and pleasure overlov'd. [...] Or if thou covet death, as utmost end [...] 1020 [...] Of miserie, so thinking to evade [...] The penaltie pronounc't, doubt not but God [...] Hath wiselier arm'd his vengeful ire then so [...] To be forestall'd; much more I fear least Death [...] So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine [...] We are by doom to pay; rather such acts [...] Of contumacie will provoke the highest [...] To make death in us live: Then let us seek [...] Som safer resolution, which methinks [...] I have in view, calling to minde with heed [...] 1030 [...] Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise [...] The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless [...] Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe [...] Satan, who in the Serpent hath contriv'd [...] Against us this deceit: to crush his head [...] Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost [...] By death brought on our selves, or childless days [...] Resolv'd, as thou proposest; so our Foe [...] Shall scape his punishment ordain'd, and wee [...] Instead shall double ours upon our heads. [...] 1040 [...] No more be mention'd then of violence [...] Against our selves, and wilful barrenness, [...] That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely [...] Rancor and pride, impatience and despite, [...] Reluctance against God and his just yoke [...] Laid on our Necks. Remember with what mild [...] And gracious temper he both heard and judg'd [...] Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected [...] Immediate dissolution, which we thought [...] Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee [...] 1050 [...] Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold, [...] And bringing forth, soon recompenc't with joy, [...] Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope [...] Glanc'd on the ground, with labour I must earne [...] My bread; what harm?

Furthermore, an ancient Statute (51 Henry III, c.5) required that accounts should be cleared in order.
