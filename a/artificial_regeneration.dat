40|$|The Romanian {{forest area}} in 2010 was 6, 515 million ha, which {{represents}} approx. 27. 3 % {{of the national}} territory. At European level, Romania is ranked 13 in the areas occupied by forests, but below the average forest coverage of 32 %. After a decline in forested areas recorded between 1990 and 2000 {{there was a slight}} rebound in the last decade, with an FAO estimated growth of over 30 000 ha per year between 2005 and 2011. This growth is primarily attributed to natural regenerations. If the production function is intrinsically provided in different proportions by all the functional categories, the protective function has a special attention, having clear typological distinctions, based on well-established natural or social components. Only maintenance work is allowed in protection forests. The total volume of timber harvested in Romania in 2010 was about 17 million m 3, according to NFA upon reading the regeneration cuts of an area of over 99 hectares, 5000 ha of which by cuttings Compared to 2000, when they harvested less than 14 million m 3, one can see a substantial increase of approx. 20 %.

30|$|Natural {{regeneration}} {{with the}} consequent avoidance {{of the need}} for financial investments in <b>artificial</b> tree <b>regeneration</b> works well where competitive understory vegetation is sparse. Although dense stand conditions prior to regeneration cutting can reduce the amount of understory vegetation, numerous forest types in the world have understory vegetation that is highly shade tolerant and understory species that can respond very aggressively and competitively to canopy opening, even after partial harvests (e.g. Noguchi and Yoshida 2004; Donoso and Nyland 2005; Nilsson and Wardle 2005; Bose et al. 2014; Dodson et al. 2014). In these forests, regeneration of desirable tree species (especially, but not limited to shade-intolerant species) may be poor or delayed for years or even decades (Hibbs and Bower 2001; Axelsson et al. 2014).|$|R

Twelve natural forest stands and one plantation were analyzed. The average numbers of desiccated Norway spruces per stand and isoenzyme gene markers were used for comparison purposes. The results indicate that the Norway spruce population from Mt Vlašić deviates markedly from the other sampled populations, both in genetic structure and in the recorded numbers of insects, {{as well as in the}} number of desiccated trees. These results suggest the importance of using only indigenous Norway spruce reproductive material in <b>artificial</b> forest <b>regeneration</b> to ensure its higher adaptability potential. It is also necessary to develop a dynamic management system for Norway spruce in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which will ensure the systemic stability of forest structures.

40|$|Schwann cells play an {{important}} role in the peripheral nervous system, especially in nerve repair following injury, so <b>artificial</b> nerve <b>regeneration</b> requires an effective technique for obtaining purified Schwann cells. In vivo and in vitro pre-degeneration of peripheral nerves have been shown to obtain high-purity Schwann cells. We believed that in vitro pre-degeneration was simple and controllable, and available for the clinic. Thus, we co-cultured the crushed sciatic nerves with bone marrow-derived cells in vitro. Results demonstrated that, 3 hours after injury, a large number of mononuclear cells moved to the crushed nerves and a large number of bone marrow-derived cells infiltrated the nerve segments. These changes promoted the degradation of the nerve segments, and the dedifferentiation and proliferation of Schwann cells. Neural cell adhesion molecule and glial fibrillary acidic protein expression were detected in the crushed nerves. Schwann cell yield was 9. 08 ± 2. 01 × 10 4 /mg. The purity of primary cultured Schwann cells was 88. 4 ± 5. 79 %.

40|$|Invasive plants {{decrease}} biodiversity, modify vegetation structure, and inhibit {{growth and}} reproduction of native species. Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica Thunb.) {{is the most}} prevalent invasive vine in the forestlands of eastern Texas. Hence, we aimed to identify potential factors influencing {{the distribution of the}} species, quantify the relative importance of each factor, and test possible management strategies. We analyzed an extensive dataset collected as part of the Forest Inventory and Analysis Program of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service to quantify the range expansion of Japanese honeysuckle in the forestlands of eastern Texas from 2006 to 2011. We then identified potential factors influencing the likelihood of presence of Japanese honeysuckle using boosted regression trees. Our results indicated that the presence of Japanese honeysuckle on sampled plots almost doubled during this period (from 352 to 616 plots), spreading extensively, geographically. The probability of invasion was correlated with variables representing landscape conditions, climatic conditions, forest features, disturbance factors, and forest management activities. Habitats most at risk to invasion under current conditions occurred primarily in northeastern Texas, with a few invasion hotspots in the south. Estimated probabilities of invasion were reduced most by <b>artificial</b> site <b>regeneration,</b> with habitats most at risk again occurring primarily in northeastern Texas...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. —Continuing {{difficulty}} in the successful natural regeneration of economically important oak species (Quercus spp.) on highly productive sites {{has led to}} considerable research {{regarding the use of}} <b>artificial</b> oak <b>regeneration</b> to ensure recruitment of oak as an important component of future stands. Two obstacles to the success of some oak plantings in Tennessee are herbivory by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus (Boddaert)) and competition from an invasive non-native grass, Nepalese browntop (Microstegium vimineum (Trin.) A. Camus). We examined the effects of both deer herbivory and the Nepalese browntop on the first-year growth of outplanted, high quality, locally adapted, 1 - 0 northern red oak (Q. rubra L.) seedlings on the Ames Plantation in Tennessee. Northern red oak seedlings were outplanted under four overstory treatments (no cut, high grade, commercial clearcut, and two age). Seedling growth, deer browse pressure (defined as browse on terminal or lateral shoots), and herbaceous biomass were monitored monthly through the 2002 growing season. Browse pressure accounted for approximately 67 percent of the variation in total seedling height growth, and exhibited a strong negative relationship with total growth (r =- 0. 82; slope =- 0. 48).

40|$|Infiltration {{rates in}} {{undisturbed}} forest environments are generally high. These high infiltration rates {{may be reduced}} when forest management activities such as timber harvesting and/or prescribed fires are used. Post-harvest residue burning is a common site preparation treatment used in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA, to reduce forest fuels and to prepare sites for natural and <b>artificial</b> tree <b>regeneration.</b> Prescribed burn operations attempt to leave sites with the surface condition of a low-severity burn. However, some of the areas often experience surface conditions associated with a high-severity burn which may result in hydrophobic or water repellent conditions. In this study, infiltration rates were measured after logging slash was broadcast burned from two prescribed burns. The two sites were in Northern Rocky coniferous forests of Douglas-fir/lodgepole pine and ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir. Simulated rainfall was applied to one-square meter plots in three, 30 -min applications at 94 mm h 21 within the three surface conditions found after the burn: unburned-undisturbed areas, low-severity burn areas and high-severity burn areas. Runoff hydrographs from the rainfall simulations were relatively constant from the plots that were in unburned-undisturbed areas and in areas subjected to a low-severity burn. These constant runoff rates indicate constant hydraulic conductivity values for these surface conditions {{even though there was}} variation between plots.

At an increased concentration of 50 mM of l-glutamate, a somewhat decreased conversion of 43 % was observed (which, however, corresponds to a nearly doubled volumetric productivity of 3. 95 g/(L d) compared to the experiments at 15 mM).

50|$|Progress {{was made}} when Norman William Jolly, {{appointed}} as Director of Forests in 1910, recognised {{the urgent need}} for regeneration of native forests and for plantations of native and exotic timbers. He established a number of experimental stations and conducted experiments with the natural and <b>artificial</b> <b>regeneration</b> of hoop, bunya, cedar and exotics. Plantation forestry began in earnest during the tenure of Jolly's successor, Edward Swain (1918-1932). Swain established the State's first commercial plantations in 1920 to 1921, planting native seedlings in the Mary Valley, Atherton and Fraser Island. An independent Forestry Department was created in 1924, with much of its workforce supplied from returned soldiers employed under a Federal Government subsidy. A comprehensive survey of remaining forests was conducted by the Forestry Department in the 1920s. It was clear that more State Forests would be needed and also substantial plantations of exotic pines. With the exception of hoop pine, native timbers did not do well in plantations.|$|E

40|$|Wildfires {{occur in}} the Republic of Mari El (Russian Federation) from time to time, that is why {{reforestation}} work {{is very important in}} the region. Some risks arise in the course of forest reproduction at fire-sites. Wastelands formation, May beetle outburst (Melolontha melolontha), fire recurrence are the most typical risks. Predominance in the forests (sandy soil) of the Republic of Mari El of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) determines regeneration of this very species. Accelerated growth of pine in fire-sites is achievable through <b>artificial</b> forest <b>regeneration.</b> The goal of our research is to study the influence of different technologies of plantation establishment in fire-sites on their development and productivity and assess possible risks mitigation in establishment and cultivation of the plantations. Eight different plots of planted Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) were studied. These plots are rectangular (Н- 1, K- 1, К- 3, К- 4, К- 5), square (К- 2) and spot planting (Н- 2, Н- 3) plots. The initial density of the planted trees was different in the plots; it was low (К- 1, К- 2, К- 3), mean (К- 4) and high (Н- 1, К- 5). It was revealed that in the plots where trees were planted with high initial density (more than 10000 trees per hectare) the risk of May beetle outburst was reduced due to quick canopy closure (up to 3 - 4 years).

The spacing pattern of transplants was either square or rectangular nearly in all variants: 1. 4 × 1. 4 [*]m, 2 × 1 [*]m, 1 × 1 [*]m, 0. 8 × 0. 8 [*]m, 1 × 0. 65 [*]m, 0. 7 × 0. 7 [*]m and 1 × 0. 5 [*]m. Conclusions following out from the research are as follows: 1. neither the chosen density of transplants nor their spacing pattern had an essential influence on the after-planting loss or damage of trees; 2. through the planting of larger-diameter transplants it is possible to achieve canopy closure more rapidly as well as faster growth of the plantation; these beech plants keep the edge in growth and quality even 6 years after planting; 3. the higher is the beech plantation density, the less individuals occur in such a plantation with inappropriate stem form; 4. beech plants of the worst quality were found on plots with the lowest initial density of transplants (5, 000 and 10, 000 pcs. ha− 1), yet the number of promising trees was sufficient even there. Thus, none of the experimental numbers of transplants per hectare or spacing arrangements of the European beech transplants can be claimed as inappropriate; however, further monitoring of the plots is necessary...|$|R

In this study, we assessed {{the risks and benefits}} of ISAM in white spruce based on long-term and multilocation, rangewide provenance test data. Our results indicate that the adaptive capacity and growth potential of white spruce varied considerably among 245 range-wide provenances sampled across North America; however, the results revealed that local populations could be outperformed by nonlocal ones. Provenances originating from south-central Ontario and southwestern Québec, Canada, close to the southern edge of the species’ natural distribution, demonstrated superior growth in more northerly environments compared with local populations and performed much better than populations from western Canada and Alaska, United States. During the 19 – 28 years between planting and measurement, the southern provenances have not been more susceptible to freezing damage compared with local populations, indicating they have the potential to be used now for the reforestation of more northerly planting sites; based on changing temperature, these seed sources potentially could maintain or increase white spruce productivity at or above historical levels at northern sites. A universal response function (URF), which uses climatic variables to predict provenance performance across field trials, indicated a relatively weak relationship between provenance performance and the climate at provenance origin. Consequently, the URF from this study did not provide information useful to ISAM.
