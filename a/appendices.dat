5|$|Groves did {{not intend}} the Smyth Report {{to be the last}} word on the project. It formed an {{addendum}} to the Manhattan District History, the official history of the project. This eventually consisted of 35 volumes with 39 <b>appendices</b> or supplements. It was written in the immediate postwar years by the chemists, metallurgists, physicists, and administrators who had worked on the project. Since there were no security restrictions, it covered every aspect of the Manhattan Project, but was itself classified. Most of it was declassified in the 1960s and 1970s and became available to scholars, except for some technical details on the construction of the bombs.|$|E

A Clash of Kings was the first book of the Ice and Fire series to make the best-seller lists, reaching 13 on The New York Times Best Seller list in 1999. After the success of The Lord of the Rings films, Martin received his first inquiries to the rights of the Ice and Fire series from various producers and filmmakers.|$|E

5|$|The {{request for}} a sequel {{prompted}} Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work: the epic novel The Lord of the Rings (originally published in three volumes 1954–1955). Tolkien spent {{more than ten years}} writing the primary narrative and <b>appendices</b> for The Lord of the Rings, during which time he received the constant support of the Inklings, in particular his closest friend C.S.Lewis, the author of The Chronicles of Narnia. Both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are set against the background of The Silmarillion, but in a time long after it.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} by School Library Journal, Smith's {{encyclopedia}} was praised for its reference value. The review called the encyclopedia comprehensive, and noted it contained helpful <b>appendices</b> including a glossary, lists of executive staff {{members of the}} CIA, and a large bibliography and index. Booklist commented in its review that the encyclopedia was a good resource to have in libraries at the academic, public, and high school levels. Publishers Weekly reviewed the encyclopedia and criticized Smith's objectivity, suggesting that he took an unabashedly positive view of the agency's role and focused exclusively on its operational successes. Despite the issue with bias, the review concluded that the book was still a useful reference work.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into nine {{chapters}} with seven <b>appendices.</b> The first chapter details the pig and its use in antiquity before summarizing the nutrient components of pork in comparison to beef. The second chapter opens with the defining characteristics of a good bacon pig. The six principal breeds of the United Kingdom {{at the time were}} the Large White Yorkshire, the Middle White, the Tamworth, the Berkshire, the Lincolnshire Curly-Coated and the Large Black. The Large White Yorkshire breed is traced to Robert Bakewell and highlights the importance of the breed for its quick maturity, rapid fattening and providing a long side. Though also credited for the breeding of the Small White pig, Bakewell was secretive in his work and evidence of his pig breeding (as a whole) cannot be confirmed. Nicholls describes the other breeds and provides information on the number of pigs, the state of the industry and the classification of pigs for the market.|$|E

5|$|The series {{consists}} of twelve historical fiction books {{written by the}} journalist, author and screenwriter George MacDonald Fraser, that were published between 1969 and 2005. The series {{consists of}} eleven novels and one collection of short stories, spanning from 1839 to 1894; they are the memoirs of the fictional character General Sir Harry Paget Flashman, VC, KCB, KCIE. Although Flashman is fictional, the settings {{and history of the}} events, and the people with whom he interacts are all largely based around historical events and individuals, although three contain elements of other novels. Flashman first appeared in the 1857 semi-autobiographical novel Tom Brown's School Days by Thomas Hughes as a bully at Rugby School, who persecutes Tom Brown, and who is expelled for drunkenness: Fraser's series of novels starts with Flashman's expulsion from school. Based on a literary conceit, an explanatory note—itself also fictional—at the start of Flashman sets the context and explains that the memoirs had been found in an auction house in Ashby, Leicestershire and had subsequently come into the possession of Fraser, who has acted in the role of editor. Fraser also included pages of notes and <b>appendices</b> {{at the end of each}} volume, providing the factual background for Flashman's endeavours.|$|E

40|$|In March 2011, Ball State {{completed}} a draft self-study report assessing the university's intercollegiate athletics program. A final report will {{be prepared for}} submission to the NCAA by April 29, 2011. Compiled by a campuswide steering committee and four subcommittees, the report assesses the university's performance on seven NCAA operating principles, demonstrating how the athletics program has met these standards since its 2002 certification and how any deficiencies will be corrected. The principles and the report cover four general areas: Academic Integrity, Gender and Diversity Issues, Governance and Rules Compliance, Student-Athlete Well-Being.
