5|$|The two men saw an {{extraordinarily}} dense cloud rising rapidly above the peak. This cloud and {{a request by}} a messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, but that night a tremor awoke him and his mother, prompting them to <b>abandon</b> <b>the</b> house for the courtyard. Further tremors near dawn caused the population to <b>abandon</b> <b>the</b> village and caused disastrous wave action in the Bay of Naples.|$|E

5|$|After these incidents, the US Congress and NASA {{considered}} {{whether to}} <b>abandon</b> <b>the</b> program {{out of concern}} for astronauts' safety but NASA administrator Daniel Goldin decided to continue the program. The next flight to Mir, STS-86, brought Increment astronaut David Wolf to the station.|$|E
5|$|All {{the other}} Channel Islands raids were less successful. In January 1943, Operation Huckabuck, {{a raid on}} Herm, was a failure. After three {{attempts}} to scale the islands cliffs the Commandos finally reached the top, {{but there were no}} signs of any German occupation troops or of the island's population. The next raids were Operations Hardtack 28 and Hardtack 7 in December 1943. The Hardtack 28 raid on Jersey ended in failure when two men were killed and one wounded after they walked into a minefield. The exploding mines alerted the German garrison and the Commandos had to <b>abandon</b> <b>the</b> operation. In Hardtack 7 the Commandos had returned to Sark, but had to <b>abandon</b> <b>the</b> operation and return to England when they were unable to scale the island's cliffs.|$|E
5|$|As {{the cavalry}} {{got closer to}} the salt mine, Averell {{discovered}} that the mine was defended by a large force of infantry and cavalry. He decided to <b>abandon</b> <b>the</b> planned attack on the salt mine, and proceeded toward Wytheville, intending to join with Crook's infantry.|$|E

5|$|Besieged {{forces would}} {{sometimes}} launch sorties {{in an attempt}} to fire the attackers' camps or equipment. When Hugh Capet besieged Laon in 986–987, his troops became drunk one night, and Duke Charles's men sallied forth and torched the camp, forcing Hugh to <b>abandon</b> <b>the</b> siege.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII chose many centrist cabinets, as {{he wanted}} to appease the populace, much {{to the dismay of}} his brother, the ultra-royalist Count of Artois. Louis always dreaded the day he would die, believing that his brother, and heir, Artois, would <b>abandon</b> <b>the</b> centrist {{government}} for an ultra-royalist autocracy, which would not bring favourable results.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the disputes between the Assassins and Taj al-Muluk Buri, atabeg of Damascus, Baldwin II of Jerusalem invaded Damascene territory and laid siege to Banias in November 1129. Bohemond and Joscelin joined Baldwin, but a heavy rainfall forced the crusaders to <b>abandon</b> <b>the</b> siege.|$|E

5|$|About {{seven minutes}} after {{stepping}} onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded {{the bag and}} tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh.

5|$|Afterward, Evans {{moved the}} Klan's {{national}} headquarters to Washington, D.C., where {{the murder of}} Simmon's lawyer had received less publicity. To Evans' consternation, Stephenson also formed a women's auxiliary group. Evans and Stephenson subsequently exchanged allegations of sexual impropriety. Police charged Stephenson with the kidnapping, {{rape and murder of}} a young woman; he maintained that the charges were orchestrated by Evans. After a sensational trial, Stephenson was convicted of second degree murder and given a life sentence; the publicity about the leader's behavior caused thousands of members to <b>abandon</b> <b>the</b> Klan.|$|E
5|$|Although {{membership}} in the Klan was limited to men, Simmons—after losing control of the national organization—attempted to create a parallel white supremacist organization for women. Evans established a women's group and sued him. Evans won the lawsuit, leading to a public war of words with Simmons, whose lawyer was soon murdered by Evans' press agent, an event in which Evans denied complicity. In 1924, Evans paid Simmons $145,000 for a promise to <b>abandon</b> <b>the</b> latter's claim to Klan leadership.|$|E

5|$|Another {{conversion}} {{project in}} early 1956 {{called for the}} installation of two Polaris nuclear ballistic missile launchers with a capacity for sixteen weapons. Also proposed were four RIM-8 Talos SAM launchers with eighty missiles per launcher and twelve RIM-24 Tartar SAM launchers with 504 missiles. A July 1956 estimate projected completing the ship by July 1961, {{but the cost of}} the conversion ultimately forced the Navy to <b>abandon</b> <b>the</b> project.|$|E
5|$|As {{darkness}} fell, {{both sides}} took stock and made tentative plans for continuing the action. Admiral Fletcher, obliged to <b>abandon</b> <b>the</b> derelict Yorktown and feeling {{he could not}} adequately command from a cruiser, ceded operational command to Spruance. Spruance knew the United States had won a great victory, {{but he was still}} unsure of what Japanese forces remained and was determined to safeguard both Midway and his carriers. To aid his aviators, who had launched at extreme range, he had continued to close with Nagumo during the day and persisted as night fell.|$|E
5|$|As {{the convoy}} of landing craft and other vessels ferried the Commandos across the English Channel; however, {{they had a}} chance {{encounter}} with a German tanker escorted by a number of armed trawlers which proceeded to fire upon them. In the confusion that followed a number of the landing craft were damaged and forced to turn back, while others were reported as missing and believed sunk. As a result {{the decision was made to}} <b>abandon</b> <b>the</b> attack.|$|E

The fugitives are shot down by a mutineer during their escape, injuring Amelia.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed, the {{clientele}} of Salon Kitty decreased. In July 1942, {{the building was}} demolished during a British air attack and the brothel had to be relocated.

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Abu'l-Abbas {{set out from}} Damascus and headed for Ramlah, during which he learned of Khumarawayh's arrival in Syria. At this point, however, the Abbasid {{offensive}} was hampered by a dispute between its commanders, which was caused when Abu'l-Abbas accused Ishaq ibn Kundaj and Ibn Abu'l-Saj of cowardice. In response to this insult, the two generals decided to <b>abandon</b> <b>the</b> campaign, and left Abu'l-Abbas to face Khumarawayh's forces by himself.|$|E
