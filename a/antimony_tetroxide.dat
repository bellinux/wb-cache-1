50|$|<b>Antimony</b> <b>tetroxide</b> is an {{inorganic}} compound with the formula Sb2O4. This material, which exists as the mineral cervantite, is white but reversibly yellows upon heating. The material, with empirical formula SbO2, is called <b>antimony</b> <b>tetroxide</b> to signify {{the presence of}} two kinds of Sb centers.|$|E
50|$|Cervantite is an {{antimony}} oxide mineral with formula Sb3+Sb5+O4 (<b>antimony</b> <b>tetroxide).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Class I, {{where the}} valences are [...] "trapped," [...] or {{localized}} {{on a single}} site, such as Pb3O4 and <b>antimony</b> <b>tetroxide.</b> There are distinct sites with different specific valences in the complex that cannot easily interconvert.|$|E
5000|$|An {{inorganic}} nonaqueous solvent is {{a solvent}} other than water, {{that is not}} an organic compound. Common examples are liquid ammonia, liquid sulfur dioxide, sulfuryl chloride and sulfuryl chloride fluoride, phosphoryl chloride, dinitrogen <b>tetroxide,</b> <b>antimony</b> trichloride, bromine pentafluoride, hydrogen fluoride, pure sulfuric acid and other inorganic acids. These solvents are used in chemical research and industry for reactions that cannot occur in aqueous solutions or require a special environment.|$|R
5000|$|Antimony {{trioxide}} {{is formed}} when antimony is burnt in air. In the gas phase, the molecule {{of the compound}} is , but it polymerizes upon condensing. Antimony pentoxide (...) can be formed only by oxidation with concentrated nitric acid. Antimony also forms a mixed-valence oxide, <b>antimony</b> <b>tetroxide</b> (...) , which features both Sb(III) and Sb(V). Unlike oxides of phosphorus and arsenic, these oxides are amphoteric, do not form well-defined oxoacids, and react with acids to form antimony salts.|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to remove arsenic from {{antimony}} trioxide by two techniques: first, by selectively volatilizing the more volatile arsenic trioxide from a mixed oxide sample; and, second, by selectively condensing the less volatile <b>antimony</b> <b>tetroxide</b> at high temperatures, leaving arsenic trioxide to condense out at a lower temperature. Thermodynamic analysis of the As-Sb-O system indicated that if arsenic and antimony oxides behave like pure solid phases, {{then there is no}} limitation to producing pure antimony oxide by these proposed techniques. The selective volatilization experiments {{were carried out}} at 379 degrees Celsius to 587 degrees Celsius, using both nitrogen and air as carrier gases and an industrial antimony trioxide fume containing 13. 8 wt pct As. The results showed it is difficult to achieve an arsenic content below 5. 0 wt pct using either air or nitrogen, and formation of solid solutions between arsenic and antimony trioxides appears to be the main barrier to the removal of arsenic. Selective condensation experiments were carried out in which a mixed oxide vapor was progressively cooled through a series of condensers over a controlled temperature profile. Injection of oxygen into the vapor improved separation, and <b>antimony</b> <b>tetroxide</b> containing as low as 0. 23 wt pct As was obtained. The recovery of <b>antimony</b> <b>tetroxide</b> in the experiments seems to have been limited by kinetic factors, and the results suggest that high conversions to <b>antimony</b> <b>tetroxide</b> are likely to be achieved only in antimony-rich vapors...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{treating}} concentrates with increasingly {{higher levels of}} arsenic and antimony {{is compounded by the}} trertd to stricter environmental guidelines regarding the disposal of smelter wastes. Much of the arsenic and antimony from non-ferrous processes is recovered as oxide fume. The options for handling these fumes include recycling them to the smelter, stabilising and disposing of them, and recovering values from them. Whilst arsenic oxide has little value, there is a market for antimony oxide and this provides an incentive for devising techniques for separating antimony oxide from arsenic oxide before disposal of the arsenic oxide. Arsenic can be separated from antimony oxide by selectively volatilising the more volatile arsenic trioxide from a mixed oxide sample or by selectively condensing the less volatile <b>antimony</b> <b>tetroxide</b> at high temperatures, leaving arsenic trioxide to condense out at lower temperatures. The results of selective volatilisation experiments at 379 to 587 degrees Celsius indicate {{that it is difficult to}} achieve an arsenic content below 5. 0 wt. % using air or nitrogen as carrier gas due to the formation of solid solutions between the two oxides. Injection of oxygen into a mixed vapor stream improved separation by selective condensation and <b>antimony</b> <b>tetroxide</b> containing as low as 0. 23 wt. % was obtained in laboratory experiments...|$|E
40|$|An X-ray {{diffraction}} {{study of}} arsenic-trioxide and antimony-trioxide samples encapsulated under vacuum and then held at 395 degrees Celsius for 24 hours revealed that cubic arsenic trioxide dissolves into cubic antimony trioxide up to a limit between 12. 9 and 19. 0 wt pct As. It {{was also found}} that arsenic trioxide does not dissolve as readily into <b>antimony</b> <b>tetroxide,</b> although the upper limit could not {{be determined by the}} technique used. These findings have implications in terms of their effect on proposed thermal techniques for separating arsenic and antimony oxides...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The present work {{aimed to}} study the {{possibility}} of increasing flame retardancy of polymeric composite materials reinforced by fibers coated by <b>antimony</b> <b>tetroxide</b> (Sb 4 O 6) as a coating layer 4 mm thickness to react and prevent spread of flame on surface of composite material consist of epoxy resin reinforced by Kevlar fibers and exposed this coating layer to oxyacetylene flame with different exposure distances 10, 15, 20 mm and study the resistance of flame retardant material layer to the flames and protected the substrate. The experimental results show that a great increment in thermal resistance and flame retardancy after coating by tetroxide as well as rising flame resistance increased exposure distances to flame. Determination the percentage contribution effects of main factors were time, exposure distance,and noise variables (error) to the variability of the surface temperature at significant level (Î±= 0. 05). Results show {{that the percentage of}} main factors were:time= 63. 15 %, exposure distance= 14. 81 % and noise variables= 22. 04 %...|$|E
