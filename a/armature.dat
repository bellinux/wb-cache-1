5|$|ReCore is an action-adventure {{platform}} {{video game}} developed by Comcept and <b>Armature</b> Studio, with major assistance by Asobo Studio, {{and published by}} Microsoft Studios for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One. The game was released worldwide in September 2016, and re-released on August 29, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Trying {{to come up}} with {{a better}} way to {{generate}} alternating current, Tesla developed a steam powered reciprocating electricity generator. He patented it in 1893 and introduced it at the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition that year. Steam would be forced into the oscillator and rush out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an <b>armature.</b> The magnetic <b>armature</b> vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} is the electric action which uses low voltage DC to control the key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control the action indirectly through air pressure valves (pneumatics), {{in which case the}} action is electro-pneumatic. In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet. When electricity operates the action directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is commonly referred to as direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet's <b>armature</b> carries a disc pallet.|$|E

40|$|A {{capacitor}} {{is made of}} two <b>armatures</b> and a dielectric {{between the}} two <b>armatures.</b> In this paper, {{we are going to}} study the plane capacitor, which is made of two equal metal <b>armatures,</b> plane and parallel, having the S surface, situated at a distance d much shorter than the <b>armatures</b> dimensions, between which there is a liniar, homogenous and isotropic dielectric having a constant electrical permittivity. The purpose of studying the plane capacitor, through MEF, presented in this paper,is to establish the stress to which the dielectrics may be subject to, in daily practice, and the influence that their superposition in an electric field has, on each of them. The study of the plane capacitor, finalised with observations on the raise of the dependence of the electric field intensity in air {{on the size of the}} air layer and having as parameter the type of dielectric material introduced between the <b>armatures,</b> is an example of confirmation or invalidation of the possibility and utility of using layers of dielectrics between the <b>armatures</b> of the capacitors...|$|R
5|$|Development {{began in}} 2014. The game was {{directed}} by Mark Pacini, written by Joseph Staten and conceptualized by Keiji Inafune. Mega Man and Metroid were significant influences in its creation. The development was divided between <b>Armature</b> Studio and Comcept into their own distinctive proficiencies, while Asobo Studio assisted. ReCore received mixed reviews, the most critical of which noted insufficient design choices, technical issues regarding lengthy and unsuccessful loading screens – later redressed – and repetitive combat. Praise was overall focused on the story, platforming and controls.|$|E
5|$|Maverick Hunter is the codename for a {{cancelled}} first-person shooter {{video game}} in the Mega Man franchise {{that would have been}} developed by <b>Armature</b> Studio and published by Capcom. It was intended to be a darker entry in the Mega Man X series. Mega Man artist and producer Keiji Inafune was responsible for establishing the western-designed game and Adi Granov was responsible for X's new design. It was intended to be the first of a trilogy of games, where players controlled its protagonist X {{in the first two games}} and then as Zero for the third. The game would have had similar platform elements found in earlier Mega Man X titles. It had a lifespan of about six months in 2010 before it was ultimately cancelled due to the aforementioned internal disagreements around the same time as Inafune departed from Capcom and other Mega Man titles were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Maverick Hunter was in {{development}} by <b>Armature</b> Studio and {{was to be}} published by Capcom for the Mega Man X series. The collaboration was established by Keiji Inafune, who had previously worked on the Mega Man series as an artist and producer. He had since rose in the ranks at Capcom to become a producer. The goal was to attract a new audience to the Mega Man series. Its development would have been overseen by former Capcom producer Ben Judd. The redesign for the Mega Man character was to be done by Adi Granov (the concept artist responsible for the Iron Man redesign found in the 2008 film of the same name). An initial concept design showed X with a red glowing 'X' on his face.|$|E

5|$|Rubidium {{compounds}} {{are sometimes}} used in fireworks {{to give them}} a purple color. Rubidium has also been considered for use in a thermoelectric generator using the magnetohydrodynamic principle, where rubidium ions are formed by heat at high temperature and passed through a magnetic field. These conduct electricity and act like an <b>armature</b> of a generator thereby generating an electric current. Rubidium, particularly vaporized 87Rb, {{is one of the most}} commonly used atomic species employed for laser cooling and Bose–Einstein condensation. Its desirable features for this application include the ready availability of inexpensive diode laser light at the relevant wavelength, and the moderate temperatures required to obtain substantial vapor pressures. For cold atom applications requiring tunable interactions, 85Rb is preferable due to its rich Feshbach spectrum.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{puddled iron}} <b>armature</b> {{designed}} by Gustave Eiffel was replaced. Low-carbon corrosion-resistant {{stainless steel bars}} that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium, an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves. To prevent the ray and arm making contact, the ray was realigned by several degrees. The lighting was again replaced—night-time illumination subsequently came from metal-halide lamps that send beams of light to particular parts of the pedestal or statue, showing off various details. Access to the pedestal, which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s, was renovated to create a wide opening framed {{by a set of}} monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation. A modern elevator was installed, allowing handicapped access to the observation area of the pedestal. An emergency elevator was installed within the statue, reaching up {{to the level of the}} shoulder.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} effect of {{geometric}} variations on the crashworthiness performance of new steering wheels. Experimental tests were carried out on steering wheel <b>armatures</b> from popular 1996 [...] 2001 compact vehicles. The <b>armatures</b> were subjected to impact loading using a drop tower testing device in which a 57 kg rigid plate impacted a steering wheel with a velocity of 3. 2 m/s. The purpose of the experimental tests {{was to investigate the}} crashworthiness characteristics of steering wheel <b>armatures</b> from a similar vehicle line in terms of peak loads, Crush Force Efficiency, elastic response, energy efficiency, specific energy absorption and the Energy Absorption Factor. In order to obtain comparable results a rigid plate was used to impact the steering wheel <b>armatures.</b> Based on the findings, a parametric study investigating the effects of dish depth and 3 o 2 ̆ 7 clock and 9 o 2 ̆ 7 clock spoke angle was conducted. A safety rating system for steering wheel <b>armatures</b> was developed and the <b>armatures</b> were ranked in descending order. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

25|$|A {{balanced}} <b>armature</b> is a {{sound transducer}} design primarily intended to increase the electrical efficiency of the element by eliminating the stress on the diaphragm characteristic of many other magnetic transducer systems. As shown schematically in the first diagram, it consists of a moving magnetic <b>armature</b> that is pivoted so it can move {{in the field of}} the permanent magnet. When precisely centered in the magnetic field there is no net force on the <b>armature,</b> hence the term 'balanced.' As illustrated in the second diagram, when there is electric current through the coil, it magnetizes the <b>armature</b> {{one way or the other}}, causing it to rotate slightly one way or the other about the pivot thus moving the diaphragm to make sound.|$|E
25|$|The {{design is}} not {{mechanically}} stable; a slight imbalance makes the <b>armature</b> stick to one pole of the magnet. A fairly stiff restoring force {{is required to}} hold the <b>armature</b> in the 'balance' position. Although this reduces its efficiency, this design can still produce more sound from less power than any other. Popularized in the 1920s as Baldwin Mica Diaphragm radio headphones, balanced <b>armature</b> transducers were refined during World War II for use in military sound powered telephones. Some of these achieved astonishing electro-acoustic conversion efficiencies, {{in the range of}} 20% to 40%, for narrow bandwidth voice signals.|$|E

25|$|A railgun is {{a device}} that uses {{electromagnetic}} force to launch high velocity projectiles, {{by means of a}} sliding <b>armature</b> that is accelerated along a pair of conductive rails. It is typically constructed as a weapon and the projectile normally does not contain explosives, relying on the projectile's high speed to inflict damage. The railgun uses a pair of parallel conductors, or rails, along which a sliding <b>armature</b> is accelerated by the electromagnetic effects of a current that flows down one rail, into the <b>armature</b> and then back along the other rail. It is based on principles {{similar to those of the}} homopolar motor.|$|E
25|$|They {{generally}} are limited at {{the extremes of}} the hearing spectrum (e.g. below 20Hz and above 16kHz) and require a better seal than other types of drivers to deliver their full potential. Higher-end models may employ multiple <b>armature</b> drivers, dividing the frequency ranges between them using a passive crossover network. A few combine an <b>armature</b> driver with a small moving-coil driver for increased bass output.|$|E

25|$|This current {{makes the}} railgun behave as an electromagnet, {{creating}} {{a magnetic field}} inside the loop formed by {{the length of the}} rails up to the position of the <b>armature.</b> In accordance with the right-hand rule, the magnetic field circulates around each conductor. Since the current is in the opposite direction along each rail, the net magnetic field between the rails (B) is directed at right angles to the plane formed by the central axes of the rails and the <b>armature.</b> In combination with the current (I) in the <b>armature,</b> this produces a Lorentz force which accelerates the projectile along the rails, away from the power supply. There are also Lorentz forces acting on the rails and attempting to push them apart, but since the rails are mounted firmly, they cannot move.|$|E
