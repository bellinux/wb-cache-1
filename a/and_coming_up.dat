Robert Hanbury Brown, a physicist who would later work on radar in the US, and Keith Wood joined them in August 1939, helping fitters keep the systems operational, <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with useful methods for interception. Near the end of August, Dowding visited the base and saw the radars in the nose and pointed out to Bowen that the enemy gunners would see {{the light from the}} CRTs and shoot the operator.

5|$|Orwell wrote six novels: Burmese Days, A Clergyman's Daughter, Keep the Aspidistra Flying, Coming Up for Air, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four. Most {{of these}} were semi-autobiographical. Burmese Days was {{inspired}} by his period working as an imperial policeman and is fictionalized; A Clergyman's Daughter follows {{a young woman who}} passes out from overwork and wakes up an amnesiac, forced to wander the countryside as she finds herself, eventually losing her belief in God, despite being the daughter of a clergyman. Keep the Aspidistra Flying <b>and</b> <b>Coming</b> <b>Up</b> for Air are examinations of the British class system. Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four are his most famous novels: both are anti-totalitarian books which criticize the Soviet Union in particular.|$|E

25|$|The novelist L. H. Myers {{secretly}} funded {{a trip to}} French Morocco {{for half}} a year for Orwell to avoid the English winter and recover his health. The Orwells set out in September 1938 via Gibraltar and Tangier to avoid Spanish Morocco and arrived at Marrakech. They rented a villa {{on the road to}} Casablanca and during that time Orwell wrote Coming Up for Air. They arrived back in England on 30 March 1939 <b>and</b> <b>Coming</b> <b>Up</b> for Air was published in June. Orwell spent time in Wallington and Southwold working on a Dickens essay and it was in July 1939 that Orwell's father, Richard Blair, died.|$|E

25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E
25|$|Suede {{continued}} {{to perform in}} 2011. After their biggest show ever at the O2 Arena in London, Brett confirmed that Suede were {{in the mood for}} more shows. Suede performed at festivals around the world, including Blackberry's Live & Rockin' Festival on 19 March 2011, the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on 16 April 2011 and the SOS 4.8 Festival in Murcia, Spain, on 7 May 2011. Suede played at the Latitude Festival in Suffolk on 17 July 2011. The final performance was at the Berlin Festival on 9 September 2011, directly following the Asian tour in August. In June 2011, following the success of the compilation album, the band released remastered and expanded editions of all five studio albums. They also performed the albums Suede, Dog Man Star <b>and</b> <b>Coming</b> <b>Up</b> at the O2 Brixton Academy in London over three nights on 19, 20 and 21 May 2011, and at the Olympia Theatre, Dublin, on 24, 25 and 26 May.|$|E
25|$|The City of Chicago {{is looking}} into a plan for an express train that would take tourists, locals, and other {{travelers}} from downtown Chicago to O'Hare International Airport in about 20 minutes, which is half {{the time it takes}} on the City's Blue Line. If an express train does get built, one-time tickets would likely cost around $30 to $35. Less expensive monthly passes and family discounts might also become available. The City will look for a private company to cover construction costs and operate the system, but it's likely public money would go into building stations at the airport and downtown if the project moves ahead. The city says an engineering firm will spend the next 10 months evaluating potential routes, drafting designs <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with a construction timeline and cost estimate, then put it out for bid in 2017. In the early 1990s, the idea of a 20-minute O'Hare express train service has been proposed. Some plans included bypass tracks on the CTA Blue Line that run {{down the middle of the}} Kennedy Expressway as well as use of a Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way near the Kennedy. However no plans were ever materialized.|$|E

25|$|The Midwest Region {{featured}} upsets {{knocking off}} the fourth through seventh seeds. Among these {{was the first}} upset of the tournament with 11th seed Kansas State's win over the sixth seeded Southern California Trojans 80-67 in Omaha, Nebraska. The media had focused {{a lot of attention}} on the freshman stars of both teams, the Wildcats' Michael Beasley and the Trojans' O. J. Mayo. In reality, while Beasley and Mayo did well, it was the other K-State players who made the difference, applying a strong defense to the Men of Troy's attack <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with the school's first tournament win since 1988. Also in the Midwest Region, #10 seed Davidson defeated seventh seeded Gonzaga 82-76 in Raleigh, North Carolina. Stephen Curry led the Wildcats with 40 points, 30 of them in the second half. His 40 points are the fifth most in NCAA tournament history, and gave Davidson their first tournament win since 1969. In the same region, 13th seed Siena upset fourth seed Vanderbilt 83-62 in Tampa, Florida. Future Harlem Globetrotter Tay Fisher made all six of his 3-point attempts, the Saints never trailed and became the first MAAC team to advance since 2004. The Midwest's first-round play ended with 12th seed Villanova's upset of fifth seed Clemson, 75-69, also in Tampa. Behind by eighteen late in the first half, the Wildcats came back, taking the lead at about the twelve-minute mark and holding it for the win. The Wildcats have won more games as an underdog in the tournament since seedings began in 1979 than any other team. With Villanova's win, the Forum saw a tournament record four upsets in one day. Earlier in the day, WKU, San Diego, and Siena defeated Drake, UConn, and Vanderbilt, to set the record.|$|E
500|$|However, {{writing the}} book stopped the author from fully divulging into {{finishing}} her album <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with new music since {{she did not have}} the resources to promote like Madonna. Describing the thought as [...] "depressing", Simone admitted that the process of writing [...] "nearly drove her insane". Simone ventured into Madonna's birthplace, Bay City, Michigan where she interviewed different people and came to know about the long-standing debate among its municipality about how to honor the singer, who never accrued any recognition from the mayor of Bay City. Simone documented these instances, while also reflecting on her own career as an Indie rock musician. Titled as Madonnaland: And Other Detours in Fame and Fandom, the book was released on March 1, 2016 by University of Texas Press in the United States.|$|E
500|$|On December 3, 2009, it was {{announced}} that Marilyn Manson had parted ways with their long-time record label Interscope. That same day, the band confirmed that they had been composing new material while touring in support of their previous studio album, The High End of Low (2009). The band's eponymous vocalist also suggested that a series of special one-off concerts were in development for the near future. These performances would see each album from Manson's triptych of albums (Holy Wood, Mechanical Animals and Antichrist Superstar) being played in its entirety over three different nights in the one venue. On January 12, 2010, Chris Vrenna said that the band were [...] "talking <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with concepts" [...] for an upcoming studio album. Two weeks later, Manson confirmed on the band's Myspace profile that [...] "the new album is officially in motion." ...|$|E

500|$|However, RCA Records, {{their former}} label who {{released}} Hello Master outside their native Canada {{in all other}} territories starting in 2006, became hopeful that the band's next record would have similar success. As a result, the label continually rejected the material represented by the demo recordings the group were sending in, believing {{that none of the}} songs could perform as commercially-successful singles. RCA continually delayed the band from entering the studio in hopes that they could write such a song, {{but by the time the}} group had written 20 songs (including material that was eventually phased out of their concert setlist) the label still had no confidence in the new material. [...] "We really were in an amazing place, writing, jamming four to five times a week <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with great stuff," [...] recalled Heppner. [...] "We felt at the peak of our creativity. [...] And they were like, 'Can you write more songs?' (We were, like), 'This is insane.'"

500|$|Rick Cohoon of Allmusic {{praised the}} album for its musical variety, saying, [...] "With artists as well {{anchored}} in the business as Diamond Rio, the musical quality is a given.

He cited [...] "Beautiful Mess" [...] and [...] "I Believe" [...] as standout tracks. Ray Waddell of Billboard also thought that the singles were among the best tracks on the album, while highlighting the instrumental track [...] "Rural Philharmonic" [...] (which Olander had originally intended to record for a solo album) {{as an example of the}} band's strong musicianship. Chrissie Dickinson of The Chicago Tribune was less favorable, commending the [...] "masterful musicianship" [...] and Roe's [...] "light vocal timbre", while criticizing the song selections as [...] "mostly a paint-by-numbers trip around the musical block, from the predictable power balladry of 'I Believe' to the saccharine sentiments of 'We All Fall Down.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} mostly well-received, with a {{retrospective}} {{of the first}} season in [...] Entertainment Weekly rating it a B+, describing it as [...] "A very cool-looking episode that does the best job so far of illuminating the agents' position with relation to the government [...] "; also noting the character of Max Fenig as a precursor to those of The Lone Gunmen. Keith Phipps, writing for The A.V. Club, also rated the episode a B+, calling it [...] "a strong entry", finding that it served as a [...] "slow reveal" [...] of the series' [...] themes. Phipps also noted the importance of Max Fenig {{as a sign of}} [...] "the human toll exacted by all the dark goings on" [...] in the series, claiming that [...] "without Max we just get Mulder and Scully chasing a mysterious downed object <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> empty-handed. With Max, we start to realize the stakes for which they're playing". Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, reviewed the episode negatively, calling it [...] "a mundane forty minutes" [...] that [...] "really fails to impress", and noting that the plot follows [...] "more or less the same pattern", as the series' previous mythology episodes. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. Shearman described [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] as having been produced [...] "with style and wit", feeling that it featured a relatively static plot but was nevertheless entertaining. He found Duchovny's performance in the episode, and its final scene featuring Deep Throat's ambiguous motivations, to have been the highlights of an episode otherwise filled with [...] "smoke and mirrors"; comparing it to the earlier episode [...] "Conduit" [...] in this regard.|$|E
