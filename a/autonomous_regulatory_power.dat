40|$|Transnational Private Regulation (TPR) {{constitutes}} a new body of rules, practices and processes, created primarily by private actors, firms, NGOs, independent experts like technical standard-setters and epistemic communities, either exercising <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>power</b> or implementing delegated power, conferred by international law or by national legislation. Its recent growth reflects (A) a reallocation of regulatory {{power from the}} domestic to the global sphere and (B) a redistribution {{between public and private}} regulators. When in place, TPR produces strong distributive effects both among private actors and between them and nation states. It differs both from global public regulation and from conventional forms of private rule-making identifiable with the law merchant. The main differences concern both actors and effects. TPR is generally voluntary, mirroring domestic private regulation. Parties who wish to join the regulatory bodies participating to the regime are free to do so, however once they are in, they are legally bound and violation of the rules is subject to legal sanctions. * This freedom can be partially limited when the participation in a private regime and compliance with its standards is the condition to access to other regimes which provide market opportunities for the regulated entities. Often, subscription to a regime or compliance with a set of standards condition the access to the market or the ability to compete thereby reducing the freedom to choose. Voluntariness can be undermined by public intervention changing the regime from voluntary to compulsory. Less frequent than those observed at the domestic level are the examples of delegated private regulation to be found at the transnational level, where an explicit act of delegation by an IO or an IGO empowers a private body with regulatory power and makes the regime mandatory for the regulated entities. More diffused are the examples of ex post judicially recognised private regulation, when domestic courts recognise privately produced standards as part of customary public or private (international) law making it binding. The paper will address the factors driving towards the emergence of new TPR are identified in comparison with, on the one hand, lex mercatoria and, on the other hand, international public regimes. The focus will be then on the private sphere, looking at both the different conflicts of interests arising in the regulatory relationships and the need for governance responses; and then institutional complementarity between public and private regimes will be examined. In light of this approach, the claim that differences between public and private at the global level exist is substantiated. The publicprivate divide is analysed, comparing the domestic and the transnational level. Four different models of interaction are identified: hybridisation, collaborative law-making, coordination and competition. soft law...|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 49). Letter of Credit breakdown means analysis on it. In this report, analysis on letter of credit of Mutual Trust Bank Limited has been described. How letter of credit work in this bank has also been described. The Mutual Trust Bank Limited {{is one of the}} popular banks which are working in Bangladesh for fourteen years. Some especial analyses have been done on letter of credit. These are SWOT, STP and PESTLE analysis on letter of credit. This is totally a new analysis on letter of credit, where L/C is shown as a service and a marketing analysis has done on it. Some journal entries of letter of credit have also been described in this report. These journal entries include some new accounting treatment. Letter of credit is actually a mode of export and import business. Any country is very much dependent on its international trade. So in international trade letter of credit is a very important document. But for bank letter of credit is treated as service. All the employees of foreign exchange department of Mutual Trust bank try their best to improve this service. As Bangladesh is a developing country the opportunities of export import is increasing over years. But the problems are complicated bureaucracy, political unrest, corruption, high inefficiency cost, absence of <b>autonomous</b> <b>regulatory</b> bodies, erratic <b>power</b> supply, lack of administrative coordination, inefficient customs processing, etc faced by the exporter and importer. So, letter of credit is affected indirectly by the above mentioned problem. Although there is various problem in international trade, letter of credit is doing great effort to expand the business globally. Shimul MitraB. Business Administratio...|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of mutual recognition is almost universally acclaimed for removing barriers to trade, for enabling regulatory competition, and for preserving scope for regulatory autonomy instead of {{embarking on a}} path to harmonisation and centralisation. By using economic theories of legal federalism and regulatory competition, this paper shows that mutual recognition leads {{to a number of}} inconsistencies, which question its suitability as a conflict of law rule that guarantees a stable allocation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> within a two-level system of regulations. Mutual recognition should be understood more as a dynamic principle, which triggers a reallocation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> between different jurisdictional levels. It leads either back to the country of destination principle, to a free market for regulations, or to harmonisation. The European experience suggests that a regime of mutual recognition is primarily another path to convergence and harmonisation, instead of being an instrument that preserves decentralised <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> or even <b>regulatory</b> competition. The welfare gains from achieving market integration should be balanced against the welfare losses of an inefficient allocation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers.</b> Copyright 2008 The Authors.
