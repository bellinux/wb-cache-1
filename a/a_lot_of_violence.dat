Seventy years after the Bloomingdale Asylum's closing, the provenance of the name was fading into obscurity, and residents and brokers alike began referring to the neighborhood by its present name. The new name and recovery were both much bolstered by the non-profit Manhattan Valley Development Corporation (MVDC), founded in 1968. It sought to differentiate itself from other community development organizations by opposing the demolition of pre-war buildings in favor of renovation, and seeking to promote small business and [...] "prevent harassment by out-side management companies prevalent in low income 'minority' neighborhoods." [...] Soon, however, new investment was brought to a halt by wavering property prices in the late 1980s and early 1990s, combined {{with the rise of}} crack use and dealers in the area, which gave Manhattan Valley the {{reputation as one of the}} easiest places in the city to score a hit.

2500|$|The {{music video}} was heavily {{criticized for being}} overly violent and graphic. Madonna's {{spokesperson}} {{said that there was}} <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> because it {{tells the story of a}} woman who had probably been abused. Madonna also explained that her character was acting out a [...] "fantasy and doing things that girls are not allowed to do." [...] The video was received only early hours play on MTV. However, it was not the first time that Madonna had a video rejected for heavy rotation by MTV, since in 1990, the channel refused to show [...] "Justify My Love" [...] because of its steamy images, and in 1992 MTV only showed [...] "Erotica" [...] late at night. The decision to ban the video was a source of argument, since it appeared to be no more violent than some television shows that aired at the time. Ironically, the video went into heavy rotation on Oh! Oxygen and was streamed on America Online frequently. It was also later played frequently on VH1 Madonna programs, but in an edited format. According to Eden Miller of PopMatters, the reason why the video was possibly banned from MTV was due to the scene where it featured Madonna pointing a gun towards the police, as MTV had previously banned videos that contained guns. Miller explained that [...] "while Madonna is one of MTV's darlings, she's still a woman, and the idea of a woman taking her aggressions out on men is something the network can just not have. That's what is so disturbing [...] And that really is what it feels like for a girl." [...] MSN listed the song on [...] "Madonna's Most Shocking Moments" [...] and said the song was supporting a [...] "pro-feminist image".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytic narrative of three decades <b>of</b> oil and <b>violence</b> in Nigeria, assuming rational choice {{by all the}} actors.

Because of the uncertain outcome of out-migration, the latter solution seemed more efficient and was implemented by the military governments. However, xenophobic responses by the population in destination cities, where <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> ethnic <b>violence</b> took place, proved out-migration to be much less attractive than expected. Niger Delta states’ populations ended up being trapped in their polluted environment where “oil bunkering” and racketeering oil firms {{turned out to be the}} only viable sources of income for many people.
