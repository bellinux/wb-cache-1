5|$|At dawn on 25 March, while {{crossing}} the Tyrrhenian Sea, the French squadron was spotted, having {{been reduced to}} ten ships by a storm the previous night. Ganteaume turned his ships to the south-east and Warren gave chase. Gibraltar and Athenienne began to lag behind, and Warren, fearing his force would become fragmented, ordered his faster ships to slow down. The French were thus <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>escape</b> into the night, the British continuing on a south-east course while they quietly turned north, back to Toulon.|$|E

The seed of the Chola dynasty is brought back to their motherland by the messenger as prophesied.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} between MDO and metabolic rate is similar for both aerobic and anaerobic potential. While hiding {{is a good}} primary defense, if this fails, the organisms still need <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> quickly <b>escape</b> from a predator. Thus, anaerobic potential must stay high in the high predatory-risk epipelagic, but can drop off in the less risky darker depths.|$|R

50|$|Stenusin is a {{piperidine}} alkaloid molecule synthesized by rove beetles of {{the genus}} Stenus Latreille. By lowering its abdomen and releasing stenusin, this genus of rove beetle are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> quickly <b>escape</b> predators through a process called skimming. Skimming {{is caused by the}} low surface tension of stenusin, which rapidly spreads over water surfaces when emitted and allows the beetle to glide away from danger.|$|R
