50|$|Under the {{provisions}} of the Affordable Care Act(ACA) the commercial health insurance industry has been granted important opportunities through the privately managed healthcare insurance exchanges and the expansion of the Medicaid program in many states. There is also a growing desire of the public purchaser of health to outsource the difficult task of managing increasingly complicated patient care to the private sector which may be more efficient due to greater competitive pressures. However, the fate of the employer-based coverage market due to provisions in the ACA remains unclear. Recent evidence suggests that the erosion of the employer-based health insurance may not continue as employers may be more incentivized to continue healthcare; the cost of coverage was $8,483 versus the actual cost of dropping <b>active</b> <b>employee</b> health benefits at $17,269. While additional year-end evidence is needed, the ACA does appear to increase the opportunities of expanded growth for the private sector in the individual, Medicaid, and Medicare markets.|$|E

From 1991 to 1997 he attended Columbia University in NYC, earning a BA in Computer Science (Columbia College 1995) and an MA in Communication (Teachers College 1997). During his studies at CU, Hauben did much of his original research and writing. He was all that time an <b>active</b> <b>employee</b> of the CU Academic Information Systems (AcIS), serving for one year as a Postmaster and Consultant for Electronic Mail. [...] Hauben was co-author of the book Netizens: On the History and Impact of Usenet and the Internet, a draft of which was put online in 1994. Print editions in English (IEEE Computer Society Press) and Japanese (Chuokoron-Sha, Inc) were published in 1997. Based on his interactive online research, Hauben coined the term 'Netizen' and introduced it into popular use. In the Preface to Netizens, Hauben wrote:"My initial research concerned the origins {{and development of the}} global discussion forum Usenet....I wanted to explore the larger Net and what it was and its significance. This is when my research uncovered the remaining details that helped me to recognize the emergence of Netizens. There are people online who actively contribute towards the development of the Net. These people understand the value of collective work and the communal aspects of public communications. These are the people who discuss and debate topics in a constructive manner, who e-mail answers to people and provide help to new-comers, who maintain FAQ files and other public information repositories, who maintain mailing lists, and so on. These are people who discuss the nature and role of this new communications medium. These are the people who as citizens of the Net I realized were Netizens." [...] Hauben observed that, [...] "The word citizen suggests a geographic or national definition of social membership. The word Netizen reflects the new non-geographically based social membership. So I contracted the phrase net.citizen to Netizen." ...|$|E

The present study explores how periods of institutional change and post-socialist market transition alter network-based job finding, in particular informal recruitment. We highlight how market transitions affect both the prevalence {{and distribution of}} network-based recruitment channels: open-market environments reduce informal recruitment’s prevalence but increase its association with high wages. We test these propositions using {{the case of the}} former East Germany’s market transition and a comparison with West Germany’s more stable institutional environment. Following transition, workers in lower tiers increasingly turned toward formal intermediaries, <b>active</b> <b>employee</b> search, and socially “disembedded” matches.

In this paper, we explore financialization as an employee control strategy in a Big Four accountancy firm, and more specifically how it affects the everyday lives of the professionals within the firm. We found financialization involved attempts to transform employees work- ing lives into an investment activity where work was experienced as ‘billable hours’ that are ‘invested’ in the hope of a high future pay-off. Employees sought to increase the value of their investment by skilful manipulation. If wisely managed, this investment could yield significant benefits in the future. We argue that financialization involves <b>active</b> <b>employee</b> participation and is a way of binding other forms of control together...|$|E
40|$|While most {{research}} on business-nonprofit partnerships {{has focused on}} macro and meso perspectives, this article pays attention to the micro level. Drawing on various theoretical perspectives from both marketing and management, this study conceptually relates the outcomes of <b>active</b> <b>employee</b> participation in such partnerships to consumer self-interest. This article also explores empirically whether and when self-interest affects consumers’ responses toward firms in relation to business-nonprofit partnerships. The study reveals that self-interest can directly influence consumers’ behavioral responses toward firms (i. e., switching and buying intentions, and word of mouth), whereas the impact on evaluative responses in terms of attitude and trust is only weak. The fit between the firm and the nonprofit partner (company-cause fit) turns out to moderate this effect, with consumer self-interest only playing a role if fit is high.

40|$|Although studies {{reveal that}} {{acquiring}} knowledge {{about a new}} workplace during organizational socialization leads to better integration, the pathway through which this occurs is not well understood. Previous research has explored the psychological contract as an outcome of socialization. This study explores its role within the socialization process. A total of 161 organizational newcomers undertook surveys at months one and three of tenure, with data used to test a model within which four psychological contract dimensions mediate the relationship between knowledge acquisition and employee outcomes. At month one, organizational and employee promise strength mediated the relationship between knowledge and outcomes. At month three, organizational and employee promise fulfilment mediated this relationship. Findings confirm {{the role of the}} psychological contract in the socialization process and suggest that effective integration requires extensive knowledge provision and <b>active</b> <b>employee</b> knowledge acquisition. Practitioner points Acquisition of knowledge about a new work environment during the very early stages of tenure can positively affect newcomers’ attitudes and perceived employment relationships. Learning leads to mutual promises that are perceived to be stronger and more likely to be fulfilled, as well as reduced stress, greater commitment, and greater service quality behaviour.

40|$|Objectives The study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the costs of short-term (1 to 14 days) sickness absence of the employees to the employer {{and the impact of}} employees' physical activity on the costs. Methods The Helsinki Health Study follow-up survey made in 2007, including 3935 employees, was used in the analysis. Physical activity was based on the questionnaire data and classified into inactive, moderately active and vigorously active. Sickness absence and salary data were derived from the employer's registers. The follow-up for sickness absence was three years. The effect of physical activity on the cost of absence was analyzed with a two-part model. Results On average, an employee was absent six days a year due to short-term sickness absence, with a production loss of 2350 EUR in / during the three years. The vigorously active were less likely to have sickness absences and their absence spells were shorter than those in the less active groups. The production loss of a vigorously <b>active</b> <b>employee</b> was 404 EUR less than of an inactive employee. The average annual salary varied according to employees' physical activity, with higher physical activity associated to higher salary. Conclusions Production loss is associated with physical activity. Increasing employees' physical activity would decrease production loss.

We examined whether the higher risk of doctor-certified sick leave in women in health and social occupations compared to women in other occupations was explained by particular work-related psychosocial and mechanical risk factors. Methods A randomly drawn cohort aged 18 – 69 years {{from the general population}} in Norway was surveyed in 2009 (n[*]=[*] 12, 255, response at baseline[*]=[*] 60. 9  %), and was followed up in the national registry of social transfer payments in 2010. Eligible respondents were women registered with an <b>active</b> <b>employee</b> relationship for ≥ 100 actual working days in 2009 and 2010 (n[*]=[*] 3032). Using this sample, we compared health and social workers (n[*]=[*] 661) with the general working population (n[*]=[*] 2371). The outcome of interest was long-term sick leave (LTSL) ≥ 21 working days during 2010. Eight psychosocial and eight mechanical factors were evaluated. Results After adjusting for age, previous LTSL, education and working hours/week, women in health and social occupations had a higher risk for LTSL compared with women in the general working population (OR[*]=[*] 1. 42, 95  % CI[*]=[*] 1. 13 – 1. 79; p[*]=[*] 0. 003). After adjusting for psychosocial and mechanical factors, 70  % of the excess risk for LTSL was explained compared with the initial model. The main contributory factors to the increased risk were threats of violence and violence, emotional demands and awkward lifting. Conclusions Psychosocial and mechanical factors explained much of the excess risk for LTSL in women in health and social occupations compared with working women in general.

The central argument of this article, however, is that the economic and political changes of the last three decades – the neo-liberal turn – have played a part in altering the very notion of health so that the healthy individual is now a person who not merely passes bio-medical tests, but a person who also leads a particular life and possesses particular skills, namely, those of the active, positive, and self-governing individual. By means of a qualitative study of the sector for occupational health services (OHSs) in Sweden, this article will show how an active lifestyle has become a defining criterion of health. Furthermore, it will describe how health thereby becomes a question of choice and responsibility and how the healthy employee comes across as morally superior to the unhealthy employee.
