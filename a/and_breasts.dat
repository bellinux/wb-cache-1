5|$|The Ramayana narrates: Rama, his consort Sita and {{his brother}} Lakshmana were exiled to the forest for a 14-year period. While in the forest, Sita was kidnapped by the demon-king Ravana. Rama was {{informed}} of Sita's fate by the dying vulture Jatayu, who had been mortally wounded in trying to save her. Searching for Sita, Rama and Lakshmana reached the Krauncha forest, where Kabandha dwelt. The brothers first encountered a demoness, who tempted Lakshmana. Lakshmana cut off her nose, ears, <b>and</b> <b>breasts,</b> and the brothers moved deeper into the forest, where bad omens greeted them.|$|E
5|$|The right panel (220 × 97.5cm, 87 × 38.4in) {{illustrates}} Hell, {{the setting}} {{of a number of}} Bosch paintings. Bosch depicts a world in which humans have succumbed to temptations that lead to evil and reap eternal damnation. The tone of this final panel strikes a harsh contrast to those preceding it. The scene is set at night, and the natural beauty that adorned the earlier panels is noticeably absent. Compared to the warmth of the center panel, the right wing possesses a chilling qualityrendered through cold colourisation and frozen waterwaysand presents a tableau that has shifted from the paradise of the center image to a spectacle of cruel torture and retribution. In a single, densely detailed scene, the viewer is made witness to cities on fire in the background; war, torture chambers, infernal taverns, and demons in the midground; and mutated animals feeding on human flesh in the foreground. The nakedness of the human figures has lost all its eroticism, and many now attempt to cover their genitalia <b>and</b> <b>breasts</b> with their hands.|$|E

40|$|Premenopausal {{women with}} a new {{diagnosis}} of breast cancer are faced with many challenges. Providing health care for issues such as gynecologic comorbidities, reproductive health concerns, and vasomotor symptom control can be complicated because of the risks of hormone treatments and the adverse effects of adjuvant therapies. It is paramount that health care professionals understand and be knowledgeable about hormonal and nonhormonal treatments and their pharmacological parameters so they can offer appropriate care to women who have breast cancer, {{with the goal of}} improving quality of life. Articles for this review were identified by searching the PubMed database with no date limitations. The following search terms were used: abnormal uterine bleeding, physiologic sex steroids, endometrial ablation, hysteroscopic sterilization, fertility preservation in endometrial cancer, tranexamic acid <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> cancer, menorrhagia treatment <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> cancer, abnormal uterine bleeding <b>and</b> premenopausal <b>breast</b> cancer, levonorgestrel IUD <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> cancer, tamoxifen <b>and</b> gynecologic abnormalities, tamoxifen metabolism, hormones <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> cancer risk, contraception <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> cancer, pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> cancer, <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> cancer <b>and</b> infertility treatment...|$|R

50|$|This gene is {{a member}} of the ras superfamily, and is {{expressed}} in normal ovarian <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> epithelial cells, but not in ovarian <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> cancers. It is an imprinted gene, with monoallelic expression of the paternal allele, which is associated with growth suppression. Thus, this gene appears to be a putative tumor suppressor gene whose function is abrogated in ovarian <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> cancers.|$|R
25|$|The bikini {{has spawned}} many stylistic variations. A regular bikini is a two-piece {{swimsuit}} that together covers a female's crotch, buttocks, <b>and</b> <b>breasts.</b> Some bikini designs cover larger {{portions of the}} wearer's body while other designs provide minimal coverage. Topless variants are still sometimes considered bikinis, although they are technically not a two-piece swimsuit.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of adipose (fat) tissue changes slowly over months and years. HRT causes {{the body to}} accumulate new fat in a typically feminine pattern, including in the hips, thighs, buttocks, pubis, upper arms, <b>and</b> <b>breasts.</b> (Fat on the hips, thighs, and buttocks has a higher concentration of omega-3 fatty acids and {{is meant to be}} used for lactation.) The body begins to burn old adipose tissue in the waist, shoulders, and back, making those areas smaller.|$|E
25|$|To {{end their}} body shape campaign, Trinny, Susannah and 100 women {{go to the}} {{hillside}} chalk carving, the Long Man of Wilmington, where Trinny parades a made over woman from each shape category. Meanwhile in the distance, Susannah organizes the others into changing {{the shape of the}} Long Man into a more feminine one by lying down in white boiler suits to give the symbol pigtails, hips <b>and</b> <b>breasts.</b> The event does not come without protest, where Pagans gather in an attempt to stop the proceedings. The episode ends with Trinny and Susannah taking off in a helicopter to view the Long Man with a female form.|$|E

25|$|In the 14th century, necklines were lowered, {{clothes were}} {{tightened}} <b>and</b> <b>breasts</b> {{were once again}} flaunted. It was during the Renaissance period that the corset was born. Breasts were pushed up, pushed together and molded into firm protruding decorations that emphasized breasts to the maximum. In 1450, Agnès Sorel, mistress to Charles VII of France, is credited with starting a fashion when she wore deep low square décolleté gowns with fully bared breasts in the French court. Other aristocratic women of the time who were painted with breasts exposed included Simonetta Vespucci, whose portrait with exposed breasts was painted by Piero di Cosimo in c.1480.|$|E
25|$|Turner {{syndrome}} (TS), {{also known}} as 45,X or 45,X0, is {{a condition in which}} a female is partly or completely missing an X chromosome. Signs and symptoms vary among those affected. Often, a short and webbed neck, low-set ears, low hairline {{at the back of the}} neck, short stature, and swollen hands and feet are seen at birth. Typically, they develop menstrual periods <b>and</b> <b>breasts</b> only with hormone treatment, and are unable to have children without reproductive technology. Heart defects, diabetes, and low thyroid hormone occur more frequently. Most people with TS have normal intelligence. Many, however, have troubles with spatial visualization that may be needed for mathematics. Vision and hearing problems occur more often.|$|E
25|$|Three {{days after}} the {{disappearance}} of Beineman, her nude body was discovered face-down in a wooded gully alongside the Huron River parkway. A medical examination revealed Beineman had been extensively beaten about the face and body, with some lacerations inflicted being so severe sections of skin had been removed, exposing subcutaneous tissues. She had received extensive skull and brain injuries which had been inflicted with a blunt instrument, {{had been forced to}} ingest a caustic substance, and her neck, shoulders, nipples <b>and</b> <b>breasts</b> had been burned with the same caustic agent. As had been the case with previous victims, her killer had placed a section of cloth in her throat to muffle her screams throughout her torture.|$|E

25|$|Authorities rated Rîmaru's {{modus operandi}} as ferocious and cruel, {{based on his}} {{propensity}} for cutting off clothes, biting off flesh, dragging his victims, and hacking away at them with his weapons, also raping them while they were unconscious. Rîmaru was judged to be aggressive, impulsive and sadistic. He showed signs of vampirism; for instance, he poked several holes into the flesh of Florica Marcu, who later related how he sucked blood out of them. Cannibalism was also present; he would bite women's vaginas, pubic areas <b>and</b> <b>breasts,</b> and the missing pieces of flesh were no longer found at the crime scenes. Additionally, he had necrophiliac tendencies, continuing his rapes after his victims had died and also beating and stabbing their corpses.|$|E

Nakano eventually defeated Blayze for the title on November 20, 1994 in Tokyo at the Big Egg Wrestling Universe event. Nakano held the title for approximately five months, until losing it back to Blayze on the April 3, 1995 episode of Raw. The WWF had planned on bringing in Bertha Faye to feud with Nakano while Blayze got plastic surgery on her nose <b>and</b> <b>breasts,</b> but Nakano was found in possession of cocaine and quickly fired from the company.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{one year}} later, on July 5, 1968, the {{partially}} decomposed, mutilated {{body of a}} 20-year-old art student named Joan Elspeth Schell was found by construction workers on an Ann Arbor roadside. She had been raped, then stabbed 25 times with a knife estimated to have measured four inches in length. Several of these wounds had punctured her lungs, liver and carotid artery, with one additional wound inflicted behind her left ear fracturing her skull. In addition, her throat had been slashed, and her miniskirt then tied around her neck. Although Schell {{had been dead for}} several days, her entire lower body was in a remarkably preserved condition, whereas her head, shoulders <b>and</b> <b>breasts</b> were in an advanced state of decomposition, leading the pathologist to conclude her body had been stored in a naturally cool environment, but with the upper third of her body exposed to natural heat.|$|E

500|$|In {{the months}} leading up to Yeates' death, Tabak had used his {{computer}} to research escort agencies during business trips in the United Kingdom and United States, and contacted several sex workers by phone. [...] He also viewed violent internet pornography that depicted women being controlled by men, showing images of them being bound and gagged, held by the neck and choked. During the murder investigation, police found images of a woman who bore a striking resemblance to Yeates. In one scene she was shown pulling up a pink top to expose her bra <b>and</b> <b>breasts.</b> When Yeates was discovered, she was wearing a similarly arranged pink top.|$|E

40|$|Background <b>and</b> Objectives: <b>Breast</b> fissure is {{a common}} problem in {{lactating}} mothers, which causes early discontinuation of breastfeeding. This study was performed to compare olive oil with aloe vera extract <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> milk on pain severity <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> fissure in lactating mothers. Methods: In this clinical trial, 90 lactating mothers with breast fissure in Gonabad city (2015), were divided into three groups of 30 subjects using random allocation. In the first group, mothers rubbed 0. 5 ml of olive oil {{and in the second}} group 0. 5 ml of Aloe vera extract and 3 - 4 drops of their milk on nipple and areola 3 times a day, after each breastfeeding. The third group rubbed 3 - 4 drops of milk on the nipple and areola after each breastfeeding. The visual analog scale (for determining pain severity) and store scale (for determining intensity of breast fissure), were completed at the first day (before intervention), the third day (during intervention), and the seventh day (end of intervention). Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: At the end of the intervention, there was significant differences among the three groups in terms of the pain severity <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> fissure, so that pain severity <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> fissure was least in the group received aloe vera extract. There {{was no significant difference between}} <b>breast</b> milk <b>and</b> olive oil groups. Conclusion: The findings of this study revealed that olive oil, Aloe vera extract, <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> milk reduce pain severity <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> fissure in lactating mothers, but aloe vera extract is more effective than olive oil <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> milk...|$|R

500|$|Kamadhenu ( [...] , , [...] ), {{also known}} as Surabhi ( [...] , [...] ), is a divine bovine-goddess {{described}} in Hinduism {{as the mother of}} all cows. She is a miraculous [...] "cow of plenty" [...] who provides her owner whatever he desires and is often portrayed as the mother of other cattle as well as the eleven Rudras. In iconography, she is generally depicted as a white cow with a female head <b>and</b> <b>breasts</b> or as a white cow containing various deities within her body. All cows are venerated in Hinduism as the earthly embodiment of the Kamadhenu. As such, Kamadhenu is not worshipped independently as a goddess, and temples are not dedicated to her honor alone; rather, she is honored by the veneration of cows in general throughout the observant Hindu population.|$|E
500|$|The basic {{anthropomorphic}} form varies. Child gods {{are depicted}} nude, as are some adult gods when their procreative powers are emphasized. Certain male deities are given heavy bellies <b>and</b> <b>breasts,</b> signifying either androgyny or prosperity and abundance. Whereas most male gods have red skin and most goddesses are yellow—the same colors used to depict Egyptian men and women—some are given unusual, symbolic skin colors. Thus the blue skin and paunchy {{figure of the}} god Hapi alludes to the Nile flood he represents and the nourishing fertility it brought. A few deities, such as Osiris, Ptah, and Min, have a [...] "mummiform" [...] appearance, with their limbs tightly swathed in cloth. Although these gods resemble mummies, the earliest examples predate the cloth-wrapped style of mummification, and this form may instead hark back to the earliest, limbless depictions of deities.|$|E

[...] Divine described his stage performances as [...] "just good, dirty fun, and if you find it offensive, honey, don't join in." [...] As a part of his performance, he constantly swore at the audience, often using his signature line of [...] "fuck you very much", and at times got audience members to come onstage, where he would fondle their buttocks, groins, <b>and</b> <b>breasts.</b> Divine and his stage act proved particularly popular among gay audiences, and he appeared at some of the world's biggest gay clubs, such as Central London's Heaven. According to Divine's manager Bernard Jay, this was not because Divine himself was gay, but because the gay community [...] "openly and proudly identified with the determination of the female character Divine".|$|E
