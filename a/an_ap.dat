5|$|As {{the galactic}} plane passes through it, Serpens Cauda {{contains}} many massive OB stars. Several {{of these are}} {{visible to the naked}} eye, such as NW Serpentis, an early Be star that {{has been found to be}} somewhat variable. The variability is interesting; according to one study, it could be one of the first discovered hybrids between Beta Cephei variables and slowly pulsating B stars. Although not visible to the naked eye, HD 167971 (MY Serpentis) is a Beta Lyrae variable triple system consisting of three very hot O-type stars. A member of the cluster NGC 6604, the two eclipsing stars are both blue giants, with one being of the very early spectral type O7.5III. The remaining star is either a blue giant or supergiant of a late O or early B spectral type. Also an eclipsing binary, the HD 166734 system consists of two O-type blue supergiants in orbit around each other. Less extreme in terms of mass and temperature is HD 161701, a spectroscopic binary consisting of a B-type primary and <b>an</b> <b>Ap</b> secondary, although it is the only known spectroscopic binary to consist of a star with excess of mercury and manganese and <b>an</b> <b>Ap</b> star.|$|E

Here we show that diadenosine polyphosphates are normal constit-uents of tear fluid and are potent stimulators of tear secretion through their interaction with P 2 Y receptors. Diadenosine tet-raphosphate (<b>Ap</b> 4 <b>A)</b> and <b>Ap</b> 5 <b>A</b> were found in rabbit tears under basal conditions at concentrations of 2. 92 and 0. 58 M, re-spectively. Single applications of UTP, ATP, and <b>Ap</b> 4 <b>A</b> in-creased tear secretion to 160 8 % (n 16) (P 0. 001), 131 6 % (P 0. 05), and 162 11 % (P 0. 05) of placebo values, respectively. <b>Ap</b> 4 <b>A,</b> <b>Ap</b> 5 <b>A,</b> and <b>Ap</b> 6 <b>A,</b> but not <b>Ap</b> 2 <b>A</b> and <b>Ap</b> 3 <b>A,</b> were able to stimulate tear secretion in a dose-dependent manner.

40|$|Background: The a 2 -antiplasmin (<b>a</b> 2 <b>AP)</b> {{protein is}} known to be a {{principal}} physiological inhibitor of plasmin, and is expressed in various part of the brain, including the hippocampus, cortex, hypothalamus and cerebellum, thus suggesting a potential role for <b>a</b> 2 <b>AP</b> in brain functions. However, the involvement of <b>a</b> 2 <b>AP</b> in brain functions is currently unclear. Objectives: The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of the deletion of the <b>a</b> 2 <b>AP</b> gene on the behavior of mice. Methods: The motor function was examined by the wire hang test and rotarod test. To evaluate the cognitive function, a repeated rotarod test, Y-maze test, Morris water maze test, passive or shuttle avoidance test and fear conditioning test were performed. An open field test, dark/light transition test or tail suspension test was performed to determine the involvement of <b>a</b> 2 <b>AP</b> in anxiety or depression-like behavior. Results and Conclusions: The <b>a</b> 2 <b>AP</b> knockout (<b>a</b> 2 <b>AP</b> 2 / 2) mice exhibited impaired motor function compared with a 2 AP+/+ mice. The <b>a</b> 2 <b>AP</b> 2 / 2 mice also exhibited impairments in motor learning, working memory, spatial memory and fear conditioning memory. Furthermore, the deletion of <b>a</b> 2 <b>AP</b> induced anxiety-like behavior, and caused an anti-depression-like effect in tail suspension. Therefore, our findings suggest that <b>a</b> 2 <b>AP</b> is <b>a</b> crucial mediator of motor function, cognitive function, anxiety-like behavior and depression-like behavior, providing new insights into the role of <b>a</b> 2 <b>AP</b> in the brain functions...|$|R
40|$|Phenylglyoxal, a reagent {{with high}} {{specificity}} for arginine residues, inactivated <b>Ap</b> 4 <b>A</b> phosphorylase I from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a pseudo-first-order manner. The second-order rate constant was 11. 5 +/- 2. 5 M- 1 min- 1. The loss of activity was a linear {{function of the}} incorporation of [7 - 14 C]phenylglyoxal. The incorporation of 1. 9 +/- 0. 4 mol of phenylglyoxal/mol of enzyme accounted for complete loss of activity. The specificity of inactivation by phenylglyoxal was tested {{in the presence of}} ApnA (n = 2 - 6), ADP, ATP and Pi. The substrates, <b>Ap</b> 4 <b>A,</b> <b>Ap</b> 5 <b>A</b> and Pi protected the enzyme against inactivation, but <b>Ap</b> 2 <b>A,</b> <b>Ap</b> 3 <b>A</b> and <b>Ap</b> 6 <b>A</b> did not. <b>Ap</b> 4 <b>A,</b> <b>Ap</b> 5 <b>A</b> and Pi reduced the rate of inactivation by about 70 %, 60 % and 37 % respectively. The <b>Ap</b> 4 <b>A</b> phosphorolysis products, ADP and ATP, also partially protected the enzyme against inactivation by phenylglyoxal.

40|$|The diadenosine {{polyphosphates}} <b>Ap</b> 3 <b>A</b> and <b>Ap</b> 4 <b>A</b> {{have been}} characterized as extracellular mediators controlling proliferation of vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells {{which is a}} key event in atherogenis. It {{has been shown that}} <b>Ap</b> 3 <b>A</b> and <b>Ap</b> 4 <b>A</b> in contrast to <b>Ap</b> 5 <b>A</b> and <b>Ap</b> 6 <b>A</b> activate the G protein-coupled purinoreceptors P 2 Y. The P 2 Y receptor activation by <b>Ap</b> 3 <b>A</b> and <b>Ap</b> 4 <b>A</b> was coupled to a pertussis toxin-insensitive Gaq protein or a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gbg subunit released from the Gi subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins, triggering phosphoinositide hydrolysis and subsequent activation of PKC and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Additionally, <b>Ap</b> 3 <b>A</b> and <b>Ap</b> 4 <b>A</b> elevated cytosolic Ca 2 + concentrations. This elevation was independent of the concentration of extracellular calcium and was significantly reduced by the antagonist thapsigargin what showed the imprtance of Ca 2 + release from cellular stores. The involvement of G 12 / 13 subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins in this described signaling pathway could not be shown. The several properties of the diadenosine polyphosphates <b>Ap</b> 3 <b>A,</b> <b>Ap</b> 4 <b>A,</b> <b>Ap</b> 5 <b>A</b> and <b>Ap</b> 6 <b>A</b> can be explained by different expression of P 2 Y receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells, the number of phosphate groups (n= 3 - 6) and the presence of surface-located enzymes, which can hydrolize diadenosine polyphosphates to active metabolites with a diversity of other actions...|$|R
40|$|During {{human blood}} clotting, a 2 -antiplasmin (<b>a</b> 2 <b>AP)</b> be-comes covalently linked to fibrin when {{activated}} blood clotting factor XIII (FXIIIa) catalyzes {{the formation of}} an isopeptide bond between glutamine at position two in <b>a</b> 2 <b>AP</b> and <b>a</b> specific e-lysyl group in each of the a-chains of fibrin. This causes fibrin to become resistant to plasmin-mediated lysis. We found that chemically Arg-modified <b>a</b> 2 <b>AP,</b> which lacked plasmin-inhibitory activity, competed effectively with native <b>a</b> 2 <b>AP</b> for becoming cross-linked to fibrin and as a consequence, enhanced fibrinolysis.

5|$|After {{upsetting}} second-ranked Michigan State, 34–7, Maryland {{climbed to}} <b>an</b> <b>AP</b> Poll ranking of {{eighth in the}} nation and then defeated Georgetown. The following game they met N.C. State at Byrd Stadium for Homecoming weekend. In the first quarter, a Maryland fumble rolled out of the end zone for a safety, and soon after, another fumble set up a touchdown rush by NC State. Maryland advanced inside the N.C. State five-yard line three times but was unable to score. In the third quarter, NC State scored again to expand their lead, 0–16. Maryland scored on a 21-yard pass from Jack Scarbath to Bob Shemonski. With three minutes remaining, Shemonski connected with a pass to Pete Augsburger for another touchdown. A 47-yard drive into Wolfpack territory ended with an interception in the end zone with seconds remaining. The loss effectively ended the Terrapins' hopes for a bowl game bid.

5|$|The Advanced Placement {{program has}} offered {{students}} the opportunity to pursue college-level courses while in high school. Along with the Educational Testing Service, the College Board administered the first AP Statistics exam in May 1997. The course was first taught to students in the 1996-1997 academic year. Prior to that, the only mathematics courses offered in the AP program included AP Calculus AB and BC. Students who didn't have a strong background in college-level math, however, found the AP Calculus program inaccessible and sometimes declined to take a math course in their senior year. Since the number of students required to take statistics in college is almost as large as the number of students required to take calculus, the College Board decided to add an introductory statistics course to the AP program. Since the prerequisites for such a program doesn't require mathematical concepts beyond those typically taught in a second-year algebra course, the AP program's math offerings became accessible to a much wider audience of high school students. The AP Statistics program addressed a practical need as well, since the number of students enrolling in majors that use statistics has grown. A total of 7,667 students took the exam during the first administration, which is the highest number of students to take <b>an</b> <b>AP</b> exam in its first year. Since then, the number of students taking the exam rapidly grew to 98,033 in 2007, {{making it one of the}} 10 largest AP exams.|$|E

40|$|RATIONALE: α 2 -Antiplasmin (<b>A</b> 2 <b>AP)</b> is <b>a</b> major {{inhibitor}} of fibrinolysis {{by virtue}} of its capacity to inhibit plasmin. Although the fibrinolytic system is strongly affected by infection, the functional role of <b>A</b> 2 <b>AP</b> in the host response to sepsis is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To study the role of <b>A</b> 2 <b>AP</b> in melioidosis, <b>a</b> common form of community-acquired sepsis in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia caused by the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. METHODS: In a single-center observational study <b>A</b> 2 <b>AP</b> was measured in patients with culture-proven septic melioidosis. Wild-type and A 2 AP-deficient (A 2 AP(-/-)) mice were intranasally infected with B. pseudomallei to induce severe pneumosepsis (melioidosis). Parameters of inflammation and coagulation were measured, and survival studies were performed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients with melioidosis showed elevated <b>A</b> 2 <b>AP</b> plasma levels. Likewise, <b>A</b> 2 <b>AP</b> levels in plasma and lung homogenates were elevated in mice infected with B. pseudomallei. A 2 AP-deficient (A 2 AP(-/-)) mice had a strongly disturbed host response during experimental melioidosis as reflected by enhanced bacterial growth at the primary site of infection accompanied by increased dissemination to distant organs. In addition, A 2 AP(-/-) mice showed more severe lung pathology and injury together with an increased accumulation of neutrophils and higher cytokine levels in lung tissue. <b>A</b> 2 <b>AP</b> deficiency further was associated with exaggerated systemic inflammation and coagulation, increased distant organ injury, and enhanced lethality.
