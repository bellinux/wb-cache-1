25|$|In 2006, Leach was {{defeated}} in a considerable upset by Democratic opponent Dave Loebsack, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> Cornell College. Loebsack had only qualified for the Democratic primary as a write-in candidate, and Leach was not on many Democratic target lists. However, Loebsack managed to defeat Leach by a narrow 6,000-vote margin, largely by running up an 8,395-vote margin in the Iowa City area.|$|E

25|$|The ongoing {{involvement}} of the Canadian Forces in Afghanistan may also influence voters. Desmond Morton, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> McGill University suggested that the Conservatives could be blamed for the war because they have extended the mission twice, {{despite the fact that}} it was then Liberal Leader Jean Chrétien who was Canada's prime minister when Canada's current military involvement in Afghanistan first started in 2001. Both the Conservatives and Liberals have at various times agreed to extend the mission(s) to at least 2011, so this may result in some Canadians who are strongly against Canada's ongoing involvement, who might have otherwise typically voted either Liberal or Conservative in the past, to take their votes elsewhere in 2008.|$|E
500|$|Pat Buchanan, the {{conservative}} columnist who challenged President Bush in the 1992 presidential primaries, came to Ohio {{to campaign for}} McEwen, as did Vice President Dan Quayle and Oliver North. Though George H. W. Bush won the district, McEwen was narrowly defeated by Strickland {{in the general election}} on November 3. While he won 55-45 in the area he once represented, McEwen did not win in any of the counties that had once been in Miller's district, losing the unfamiliar territory 59-41. Strickland received 122,720 votes to McEwen's 119,252, a plurality of only 3,468. [...] "I think McEwen's loss was a case of bounced checks and some arrogance," [...] said Alfred Tuchfarber, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> the University of Cincinnati who runs the Ohio Poll. [...] "He just had a certain personal arrogance about him that didn't go down well in a poor district." [...] Strickland said, [...] "I ran against Pat Robertson, Pat Buchanan, the National Rifle Association and Right-to-Life. They threw everything at me. I'm just so happy I beat back those guys. I think they're so divisive." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott Lasley, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> Western Kentucky University and {{chairman}} of the Warren County Republican Party, criticized Bevin's appearance at the rally, saying, [...] "Either they were totally unvetted and unprepared for it, which says a lot about the campaign and its ability to compete at this level, or...they think that message is going to be receptive. Otherwise you don't go there." [...] On April 25, 2014, Bevin apologized for attending the event, saying [...] "I am genuinely sorry that my attendance at an event which, other than my comments, appears to have primarily involved a discussion of cockfighting, has created concern on the part of many Kentucky voters. I understand that concern. I am not and have never been a supporter of cockfighting or any other forms of animal cruelty." [...] The Daily Beast said the issue could be the [...] "nail in the coffin" [...] for Bevin's campaign, while The Washington Post wrote, [...] "On its own, the cockfighting story isn't enough to sink Bevin's campaign. But viewed {{in the context of the}} string of other distractions he's had to deal with, it reinforces the reality that his campaign is in serious need of repairs down the stretch." ...|$|E

Harry's classmate Hermione 'had become a bit more relaxed about breaking the rules,' writes Rowling {{near the end of}} Philosopher's Stone, 'and she was much nicer for it.' There's more than a touch of anarchy when all the students sing to their own tune. In her books, the kids are the central agents of their own lives. They make choices. Weigh judgments.

2500|$|On May 12, 1961, {{during a}} panel {{discussion}} before the Haverford Township Civic Association and League of Women Voters, a prominent Democrat and a Republican from Upper Darby spoke. Dr. G. Edward Janosik, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> the University of Pennsylvania, was opposed to the Green plan, as well as Republican plans. [...] He recognized the necessity of crossing county lines in order to equalize the population of each district.

2500|$|Some Venezuelans {{contend that}} the protests—seen as [...] "rich {{people trying to get}} back lost {{economic}} perks"—have only served to unite the poor in defense of the revolution. [...] Analysts such as Steve Ellner, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> the University of the East in Puerto La Cruz, have expressed doubt over the protests' ultimate effectiveness if the opposition cannot create broader social mobilization. Eric Olson, associate director for Latin America at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, said disruption caused by protestors had allowed Maduro to use the [...] "greedy economic class" [...] as a scapegoat, which has been an effective narrative for gaining support because people [...] "are more inclined to believe conspiracy theories of price gouging than the intricacies of underlining economic policies." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a {{consequence}} of the decision, states and municipalities are blocked from using a method of public financing that is simultaneously likely to attract candidates fearful they will be vastly outspent and sensitive to avoiding needless government expense. [...] "The government can still use taxpayer funds to subsidize political campaigns, but it can only do that in a manner that provides an alternative to private financing" [...] said William R. Maurer, a lawyer with Institute for Justice, which represented several challengers of the law. [...] "It cannot create disincentives." [...] The ruling meant the end of similar matching-fund programs in Connecticut, Maine and a few other places according to David Primo, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> University of Rochester who was an expert witness for the law's challengers.|$|E

2500|$|Duterte has {{referred}} to the Catholic Church as [...] "the most hypocritical institution", after the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines president Socrates Villegas released a pastoral letter indirectly referring to Duterte as a [...] "morally reprehensible" [...] candidate who has shown [...] "scant regard" [...] {{for the rights of}} others and the teachings of the Church, urging Filipino Catholics to not vote for him. Unlike many prominent conservative politicians, Duterte has spoken in favor of birth control, LGBT rights, and reimposition of the death penalty which was abolished by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, a devout Catholic, during her second term in 2006. Upon being elected, Duterte called local bishops [...] "sons of whores", and said he would expand family planning, which the Church had been opposed to. The Catholic Church in the Philippines had lost much of its popularity and political power since being active in overthrowing the Marcos regime in 1986. Antonio Contreras, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>science</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> De La Salle University in Manila, said that Duterte's attacks on the Church were likely to prove popular.|$|E
