5|$|Lemurs are unusual among {{primates}} {{for their}} rapid dental development, particularly <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> species.

Lemurs are also dentally precocious at birth, {{and have their}} full permanent dentition at weaning.|$|E

5|$|Adolf Seilacher has {{suggested}} the Ediacaran sees animals usurping giant protists {{as the dominant}} life form. The modern xenophyophores are giant single-celled protozoans found throughout the world's oceans, largely on the abyssal plain. A recent genetic study suggested that the xenophyophores are a specialised group of Foraminifera. There are approximately 42 recognised species in 13 genera and 2 orders; one of which, Syringammina fragilissima, is <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> known protozoans at up to 20 centimetres in diameter.|$|E
