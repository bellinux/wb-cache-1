5000|$|A {{defendant}} {{may move}} for judgment of acquittal {{after the government}} closes its evidence or all evidence under rule 23 [...] of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Clark attempted to gain acquittal on identity <b>theft</b> and <b>aggravated</b> identity <b>theft.</b> Clark argued that sections [...] and [...] of US code proscribe to the same offense. The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution would prohibit a sentence for both identity <b>theft</b> and <b>aggravated</b> identity <b>theft.</b> In United States v. Felix 503 U.S. 378 (1992), it was ruled that an offense and conspiracy to commit that offense are not the same; fundamentally one cannot be tried twice for the same offense. In this case however, the court decided that section [...] allows for punishment for both identity <b>theft</b> and <b>aggravated</b> identity <b>theft</b> and that {{the intent of the}} United States Congress is to impose multiple punishments for both identity <b>theft</b> and <b>aggravated</b> identity <b>theft,</b> as both are separate statutes. In Blockburger v. United States, , it was confirmed that multiple punishments for convictions that fall under separate statutes do not violate the double jeopardy clause. The motion of judgment of acquittal was denied, citing Chase [...] applying the same standard of review to the district.|$|R

2500|$|In Tunisia, Amri {{was sentenced}} in {{absentia}} {{to five years}} in prison, [...] "reportedly for <b>aggravated</b> <b>theft</b> with violence". Prior to that he had been arrested several times for possession and use of drugs. According to his family, he drank alcohol, took drugs and was initially not religious, but had been radicalized in Italian jails. The man arrived in Germany in July 2015 and applied for asylum in April 2016. He used at least 14 different aliases and posed as a citizen of Syria, Egypt or Lebanon. He reportedly had tried to recruit participants for a terrorist attack since the spring, and once tried to buy a pistol from an undercover police officer. He had been overheard by the German intelligence offering to carry out a suicide attack, but the German authorities had decided not to arrest him because they deemed him a mere errand boy. The German CID warned in March 2016 that he was planning a suicide attack and recommended immediate deportation. However, the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia ruled he couldn't be deported. [...] In Germany he was involved in a bar brawl and drug dealing; later he was involved in a knife attack over drugs in July 2016 and disappeared after police tried to question him. Three weeks before the attack, Moroccan intelligence warned Germany about the terrorist attack planned by him. He had started spending more time in Berlin before the attack and was being closely monitored, however showed no signs of planning a terrorist attack per a report submitted by the German Interior Minister to the state parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia. German authorities were seeking to deport him {{at the time of the}} attack, however the legal requirements hadn't been met because Tunisia initially denied that Amri was their citizen but documents confirming it arrived in Germany after the attack.|$|E
