25|$|Two {{weeks after}} Museveni {{delivered}} his ultimatum of 6 February 1994, {{it was reported}} that LRA fighters had crossed the northern border and established bases in southern Sudan with the approval of the Khartoum government. Sudanese aid was a response to Ugandan support for the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) fighting in the civil war in the south of the country. Also, convinced that the Acholi were now collaborating with the Museveni government, Kony began to target civilians with his increased military strength. Mutilations became commonplace (especially cutting off ears, lips, nose), and 1994 saw the first mass <b>abduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> and youth.|$|E
500|$|The first {{priority}} of Raúl Alfonsín was to consolidate democracy, incorporate {{the armed forces}} into their standard role in a civilian government, and prevent further military coups. Alfonsín first tried to reduce {{the political power of}} the military with budget cuts, reductions of military personnel and changing their political tasks. As for the crimes committed during the Dirty War, Alfonsín was willing to respect the command responsibility and accept the [...] "superior orders" [...] defense for the military of lower ranks, as long as the Junta leaders were sentenced under military justice. This project was resisted by human rights organisations such as Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo and public opinion, as it was expected that the defendants would be acquitted or receive low sentences. The military considered that the Dirty War was a legally sanctioned war, and considered the prosecutions to be unjustified. Alfonsín also established the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP), composed of several well-known personalities, to document cases of forced disappearances, human rights violations and <b>abduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>children.</b> Alfonsín sent a military code bill to the Congress, so that the military would use it. In its [...] "Nunca más" [...] report (...) , the CONADEP revealed the wide scope of the crimes committed during the Dirty War, and how the Supreme Council of the military had supported the military's actions against the guerrillas.|$|E

2500|$|Child {{abduction}} {{has been}} defined as a form of child abuse. and the international <b>abduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> is a serious human rights issue that continues to plague modern day Mexico. [...] The persistent failure of Mexico to address such systemic and fundamental problems within its borders has prompted many to warn that Mexico runs the serious risk of becoming a failed state with a political system that cannot satisfy the most basic conditions of civic order such as safety in one's streets, home, school and workplace.|$|E

2500|$|There {{was also}} a marked change in how the LRA {{perceived}} the conflict.

[...] Mutilations such as those {{carried out in the}} wake of the Arrow Group strategy became commonplace, and 1994 saw the first mass forced <b>abduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> and young people. Other militant groups, such as the West Nile Bank Front, adopted the LRA tactics of abductions and raids. The strategy of forced recruitment was prompted by the lack of new volunteers to continue the conflict, and the fact that the young could be indoctrinated to support the LRA much more easily than adults.|$|E

2500|$|Child {{abduction}} to Mexico {{from the}} US {{is as much}} an American policy problem {{as it is a}} Mexican one. Inasmuch as Mexico is cited for failing to take appropriate measures to curb the international <b>abduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>children,</b> the US government is likewise criticized for not taking appropriate measures to protect American children or support American parents in their efforts to recover their internationally abducted children. [...] The proximity and close relationship between the United States and Mexico makes the problems of one country the problems of both and, by extension, places the responsibility of addressing the problem on both countries. [...] US officials recognize this and have increasingly worked to assist Mexico by providing training and education to Mexican judges and law enforcement. [...] This type of bilateral cooperation is part of a broadening recognition of the responsibility both nations share in addressing problems in the region, and is most notably demonstrated in the Mérida Initiative, the $1.4 billion aid package to help Mexico interdict illicit drugs, arms and human trafficking.|$|E

The fact that a covered sledge escorted by three riders who were swathed in heavy mantles had been seen to go out of the city by the northern gate at seven o'clock last evening, was held to be sufficient proof that the unfortunate jongejuffrouw was being conveyed straightway to the coast where the pirates had their own lairs and defied every effort which had hitherto been made for their capture.|$|E
