5000|$|Two 12-week phase 3 {{clinical}} trials were performed for ospemifene. One evaluated {{the effects of}} Ospemifene on vaginal tissue thickness, composition and vaginal pH. The other evaluated the effects of Ospemifene on vaginal tissue and on symptoms of dyspareunia. Between the two trials, 4 signs and symptoms were measured. These included three tissue-related signs, two of which represented histological changes in the vaginal tissue (change in percent parabasal cells and change in percent superficial cells) and the third was [...] "change in vaginal pH". Dyspareunia was evaluated {{in one of the}} trials. It was defined as [...] "change in most bothersome symptom" [...] of discomfort during sexual activity and further limited to symptoms of either vaginal dryness or vaginal pain." [...] Ospemifene produced more changes in vaginal tissue <b>and</b> <b>greater</b> <b>reduction</b> in dyspareunia symptoms than placebo. A dose-response also was observed in the trial; ospemifene 60 mg had greater efficacy than ospemifene 30 mg. Safety was also evaluated in these phase 3 trials. There was a 5.2% increase in the incidence of hot flushes, 1.6% increase in urinary tract infections, and 0.5% increase in the incidence of headache with ospemifene over placebo. [...] One of the phase 3 trials was a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial in 826 post-menopausal women. The trial patients were required to have one or more symptom of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) that was moderate or severe in nature with fewer than 5% of cells that were superficial when examined by a vaginal smear and a vaginal pH of at least 5.0. This trial did not quantify relief of dyspareunia as a study outcome measure. The other phase 3 trial was conducted in 605 women aged 40 to 80, who were diagnosed with VVA, and whose worst symptom was dyspareunia.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of nadifloxacin alone and with benzoyl peroxide {{in the treatment of}} mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris. Patients and Methods: This double-blind, randomized study was conducted in a total of 93 acne patients, with at least 10 inflammatory lesions, but no more than 3 nodules or cysts on the face. All patients were instructed to apply nadifloxacin 1 % cream twice daily and randomized to apply either benzoyl peroxide 5 % lotion or its vehicle once daily for 8 weeks. Results: The mean percent reduction in inflammatory lesions were 22. 08 % in the nadifloxacin group (n= 46) and 53. 5 % in the nadifloxacin+benzoyl peroxide group (n= 47). Five (10. 9 %) patients in the nadifloxacin group and 18 (38. 3 %) patients in the nadifloxacin+benzoyl peroxide group achieved a 50 % <b>and</b> <b>greater</b> <b>reduction</b> in the inflammatory lesion count. Conclusion: Both treatment regimens were statistically effective, but a significantly greater reduction of the inflammatory lesions was seen in the nadifloxacin+benzoyl peroxide group.

40|$|LEPA {{is one of}} {{the most}} conserved {{translation}} factors and is found from bacteria to higher plants. However, the physiological function of the chloroplast LEPA homolog in higher plants remains unknown. Herein, we demonstrate the physiological role of cpLEPA in enabling efficient photosynthesis in higher plants. The cplepa- 1 mutant displays slightly high chlorophyll fluorescence and pale green phenotypes under normal growth conditions. The growth of the cplepa- 1 mutant is reduced when grown on soil, <b>and</b> <b>greater</b> <b>reduction</b> is observed under intense light illumination. Photosynthetic activity is impaired in the cplepa- 1 mutants, which is reflected in the decreased steady-state levels of chloroplast proteins. In vivo protein labeling experiments explained the decrease in the steady-state levels of chloroplast proteins. An abnormal association of the chloroplast-encoded mRNAs with ribosomes suggests that the protein synthesis deficiencies in cplepa- 1 are due to defects in translation initiation in the chloroplasts. The cpLEPA protein appears to be an essential translation factor that promotes the efficiency of chloroplast protein synthesis...|$|E

Methods: We compared the change of hemoglobin (Hb) levels in a cohort of 147 consecutive RA patients who were treated with biologics for more than 12 weeks. Twenty eight patients were treated with TCZ, and 119 patients were treated with biologics other than TCZ (87 with TNF inhibitors and 32 with abatacept). The change of Hb levels from baseline to week 12 was compared between the TCZ and the non-TCZ groups.

METHODS: Forty rats {{were divided into two}} groups to receive either bromopride (experimental group- E) or saline (control group- C). Each group was divided into subgroups of ten animals each to be euthanized on third (E 3 and C 3) or seventh day (E 7 and C 7) after surgery. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture. The rats underwent segmental left colon resection and end-to-end anastomosis. Adhesion formation, tensile strength and hydroxyproline concentration were assessed. Histomorphometry of collagen and histopathological analysis were also performed. RESULTS: On postoperative third day, anastomoses in bromopride-treated animals showed lower tensile strength (p= 0. 02) <b>and</b> <b>greater</b> <b>reduction</b> in hydroxyproline concentration (p= 0. 04) than in control animals.

Material and method Twelve patients with Miller class I and II recession in the canines or upper premolars were randomly divided into groups to receive treatments using SECT, ADM, or EMP. Clinical measurements were performed before and three months after surgical procedures.

40|$|The {{majority}} of clinical trials of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for schizophrenia have used individual therapy to target positive symptoms. Promising {{results have been}} found, however, for group CBT interventions and other treatment targets like psychosocial functioning. CBT for functioning in schizophrenia {{is based on a}} cognitive model of functional outcome in schizophrenia that incorporates dysfunctional attitudes (eg, social disinterest, defeatist performance beliefs) as mediators between neurocognitive impairment and functional outcome. In this report, 18 clinical trials of CBT for schizophrenia that included measures of psychosocial functioning were reviewed, and two-thirds showed improvements in functioning in CBT. The cognitive model of functional outcome was also tested by examining the relationship between social disinterest attitudes and functional outcome in 79 people with schizophrenia randomized to either group cognitive-behavioral social skills training or a goal-focused supportive contact intervention.

40|$|Blame {{attribution}} (BA) is {{the complex}} cognitive-affective {{process through which}} individuals feel negative feelings of internalized self-blame/guilt or externalized other-blame by varying degrees. High BA is accompanied by distress, anxiety, depression and reduced health outcomes, while low BA indicates healthful release from negative affect and direction of attention toward past transgressions or negative events. Previous research has demonstrated a multitude of personality and individual difference associations with BA and psychological wellbeing (PWB) in cross-sectional samples, but little focus has been directed at determining if such traits affect changes in (i. e. recovery from) BA and PWB over time. The present study seeks to address this knowledge gap using a widespread blame context: romantic breakup. It was hypothesised that the personality traits of neuroticism (N) and extraversion (E), {{as well as the}} individual difference characteristics of trait emotional intelligence (EI), religious-spiritual belief (RSB), and gender would affect blame recovery and PWB change over time. A sample of 302 undergraduates completed measures of BA, PWB, E, EI, N, and RSB in two online sessions approximately 28 days apart. Hierarchical regression results indicate that only EI was influential, leading to increased PWB growth over time <b>and</b> <b>greater</b> <b>reduction</b> in self-blame/guilt.

Space–time beamforming is used to preprocess input signals from both UWB and NB sources. The train of UWB pulses or the NB sinusoidal signals are then transmitted simul-taneously from multiple antennas into the breast. Performance is evaluated using finite-difference time-domain electromagnetic (EM) and thermal simulations with realistic numerical breast phantoms derived from magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the breast. We use three methods of mapping MRI data to complex permittivity data to account for uncertainty in {{the embodiment of the}} dielectric properties transitions in heterogeneous breast tissue. EM power-density deposition profiles and temperature profiles are compared for the UWB and NB cases in the three different breast phantoms.
