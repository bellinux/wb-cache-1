40|$|Purpose: To {{explore the}} {{essential}} meaning of being <b>a</b> <b>nurse.</b> Design: Nine registered nurses were each {{asked to write}} a story of a time when they felt like <b>a</b> <b>nurse.</b> Analysis was informed by Heideggerian hermeneutic philosophy, seeking to reveal the phenomenon of “feeling like <b>a</b> <b>nurse.</b> ”Methods: <b>As</b> part of a workshop on phenomenological methodology, participants were invited to reflect on a personal experience of feeling like <b>a</b> <b>nurse.</b> These documents were analyzed according to the method of van Manen. Participants were kept informed throughout each phase. Findings: Feelings announce pri-mordial meaning of feeling like <b>a</b> <b>nurse.</b> Nurses experience the call as mood attuned by an anxiety that creates possibilities for authentic caring. It is a way of being that encompasses watching and acting, doing to and caring for, and taking over and giving back. Moreover, it is after the encounter that the essential meaning is more clearly revealed. We argue that there is value in continuing to question the meaning of “being <b>a</b> <b>nurse.</b> ” Amid <b>a</b> complex and increasingly technological world, this calls the pro-fession to remember the human encounter at the heart of all nursing...|$|R

40|$|Successful {{coping with}} {{adaptation}} process by <b>a</b> <b>nurse</b> newly joining <b>an</b> intensive medicine workplace {{is quite a}} complicated process. Mastering sophisticated instrumentation, specialist demands of nursing care provision and everyday physical load as well as psychical stress expose each newly coming <b>nurse</b> to <b>a</b> wide spectre of demands the unconditioned coping with which is a basic precondition of successful integration to an elite team. Each incoming nurse (not just at an intensive care workplace) should be particularly supported by her nurse manager in the far from easy adaptation process, who can substantially help <b>a</b> new <b>nurse</b> adapt to the new environment and become an equivalent team member. The Thesis is aimed at the role of <b>a</b> <b>nurse</b> manager in comforting an adaptation process of <b>a</b> <b>nurse</b> joining <b>an</b> ARD and an ICU. The aim of the Thesis was to map the role of <b>a</b> <b>nurse</b> manager in adaptation process of <b>a</b> <b>nurse</b> joining <b>an</b> ARD and an ICU {{and to find out}} how such <b>a</b> <b>nurse</b> manager helps <b>a</b> <b>nurse</b> joining <b>an</b> ARD or an ICU with adaptation. Further aims were to map the process of adaptation of <b>a</b> <b>nurse</b> joining <b>an</b> ARD or an ICU itself and to examine the factors that mostly influence the adaptation process of <b>a</b> <b>nurse</b> joining <b>an</b> ARD or an ICU. A combination of qualitative and quantitative research was applied to the research part of the Thesis. A semi-standardized interview conducted with ARD and ICU ward sisters in selected hospitals in Prague was chosen as the data collection technique for the qualitative part. A questionnaire designed for nurses working at ARDs and ICUs in selected Prague hospitals, who themselves were undergoing or have recently undergone such an adaptation process was chosen as the data collection technique for the quantitative part. The aims of the Thesis have been met. The research results clearly showed that the adaptation process of <b>a</b> new <b>nurse</b> is not only based on effective specialist training, but also in integration of the nurse into the existing working team. It is thus necessary for <b>a</b> <b>nurse</b> manager to take sufficient care to the adaptation process and help <b>a</b> new <b>nurse</b> become <b>an</b> equivalent member of the team, which will thus achieve the set goals of the department as well as the whole organization under her efficient guidance. The results of our research may thus contribute to better awareness of the individual motivation factors of the adaptation process among the involved public. Upon the information found about functioning of <b>a</b> <b>nurse</b> manager in the process of adaptation of <b>a</b> <b>nurse</b> joining <b>an</b> ARD or an ICU a thought map was created, which might help as inspiration or as a manual for execution of this highly demanding process itself...|$|R
