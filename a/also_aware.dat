5|$|The Liber was {{familiar}} to the 13th-century chronicler Matthew Paris, who used it along with the Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis of Ramsey Abbey in his own historical works. Another 13th-century English writer, Roger of Wendover, was <b>also</b> <b>aware</b> of the Liber.|$|E
5|$|Huntington was <b>also</b> <b>aware</b> of the {{potential}} to ship eastbound coal from West Virginia's untapped natural resources with {{the completion of the}} new railroad. His agents began acquiring property in Warwick County in eastern Virginia. In the 1880s, he oversaw the extension of the C's new Peninsula Subdivision, which extended from the Church Hill Tunnel in Richmond southeast down the peninsula through Williamsburg to Newport News, where the company developed coal piers on the harbors of Hampton Roads and Newport News.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish forces {{expected}} the Americans {{to attack the}} northern region of the island and concentrated their defenses around San Juan and Arecibo. The Spanish government was <b>also</b> <b>aware</b> of a planned landing by the Americans at Fajardo, located {{on the east coast}} and had that town fortified. However, the southern and western regions of Puerto Rico were left with little or no defenses at all.|$|E
5|$|Although Louis had {{designated}} Mary as {{his successor}} {{in both of}} his kingdoms, the Polish nobles, seeking {{an end to the}} personal union with Hungary, were not willing to recognize Mary and her fiancé Sigismund as their sovereigns. They would have accepted Mary if she had moved to Kraków and reigned over both kingdoms from there rather than from Hungary, ruling according to their advice rather than that of the Hungarian nobles and marrying a prince of their choosing. Their intentions, however, were not to Elizabeth's taste. She too would have been required to move to Kraków, where a lack of men loyal to her would have rendered her unable to enforce her own will. Elizabeth was <b>also</b> <b>aware</b> of the difficulties her mother-in-law had faced during her regency in Poland, which had ended with the old queen fleeing her native kingdom in disgrace.|$|E
5|$|Both sides had {{suffered}} severe damage and casualties, but both were <b>also</b> <b>aware</b> {{that the battle}} would inevitably be rejoined and so {{the aftermath of the}} British defeat was one of frenzied activity at Gibraltar, Algeciras and Cadiz. While the British and French squadrons conducted hasty repairs, the French and Spanish fleet at Cadiz was prepared for a rescue mission, a heavy squadron arriving at Algeciras on 12 July. As the squadron departed with Linois's squadron, it was attacked again by Saumarez's squadron at the Second Battle of Algeciras and caught at night by faster and more manoeuvrable ships, which resulted in the British inflicting heavy losses on the Spanish rearguard but failing to destroy the French squadron for a second time.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} {{afternoon}} of 3 April, Moore considered conducting a further raid on Kaafjord the next day. He decided against doing so as the preliminary assessment of photos taken during the attack had concluded that Tirpitz was badly damaged. Moore was <b>also</b> <b>aware</b> that his aircrew were fatigued, and was reluctant to expose them to what would now be alert defences. Accordingly, he ordered that the fleet return to base, and it arrived at Scapa Flow in the afternoon of 6 April. King George VI and Prime Minister Winston Churchill sent congratulatory messages to the fleet, but both Churchill and Cunningham were concerned that Tirpitz could be returned to service. Cunningham also regretted Moore's decision not to launch a further strike on 4 April.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{was annoyed}} {{at the way}} that Royle, a Royal Navy officer, communicated {{directly}} with the Admiralty; he was <b>also</b> <b>aware</b> that Royle had been critical of SWPA's command arrangements, and {{of some of his}} decisions. MacArthur proposed that an Australian officer, Captain John Collins, replace Royle as CNS, an appointment that Carpender also supported. Over the Admiralty's objections, Curtin appointed Collins to replace Crutchley as Commander, Task Force 44, in June 1944, at the rank of commodore, with the intention that Collins would replace Royle when his term expired. This did not occur, because Collins was seriously wounded in Leyte Gulf on 21 October 1944.|$|E
5|$|Olds often {{lamented the}} lack of an {{internal}} gun in the F-4C he flew during his tour in Vietnam, but would not allow his fighters to be equipped with the gun pods then available. While he knew that he would be capable of effectively using them, he was <b>also</b> <b>aware</b> that none of his pilots were trained in the use of a gun or dogfighting. He also reasoned that the drag of the pod would both degrade the performance characteristics of the F-4 while not gaining it any advantage against the more maneuverable MiG-17s and MiG-21s, result in unnecessary losses strafing worthless targets, and reduce the number of bombs carried by the Phantoms, the delivery of which was the 8th's primary mission.|$|E

5|$|So far, the {{investigation}} {{had been on}} the natural frequency of transient oscillation of a resonant circuit resulting from a sudden stimulus. More important {{from the point of view}} of filter theory is the behaviour of a resonant circuit when driven by an external AC signal: there is a sudden peak in the circuit's response when the driving signal frequency is at the resonant frequency of the circuit. James Clerk Maxwell heard of the phenomenon from Sir William Grove in 1868 in connection with experiments on dynamos, and was <b>also</b> <b>aware</b> of the earlier work of Henry Wilde in 1866. Maxwell explained resonance mathematically, with a set of differential equations, in much the same terms that an RLC circuit is described today.|$|E
5|$|A {{decision}} {{had recently been}} made by the War Office that light tanks were no longer to be generally used in the British Army; on the whole they had performed poorly during the Battle of France and were considered to be a liability. As a result, the Vickers-Armstrong Light Tank Mk VII Tetrarch light tank was now considered obsolete. This made it available for use by the airborne forces and it was chosen by the War Office as the tank to be transported by glider. However, it had not been designed specifically as an airborne tank or to be airmobile, and it also possessed several faults. Its size limited the possible crew to three—a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret—which was found to be too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander, in addition to his own duties, had to act as loader for the 2-pounder, which caused delays in combat; a report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that since the commander had both to fight and control the tank, controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible. The War Office was <b>also</b> <b>aware</b> that the tank had a faulty cooling system that made the Tetrarch unsuitable for service in hotter climates, such as the Middle East and North Africa.|$|E
5|$|A report {{had been}} {{prepared}} for the parish council in 1903 which noted the population in Northwood – 2,700 by that time, with 530 houses – compared with the largely rural character {{of the rest of}} Ruislip parish. At a meeting of the Ruislip parish council on 28 October 1903, the forthcoming extension of the Metropolitan Railway from Harrow on the Hill to Uxbridge was also discussed as it was known that a station would be opened in Ruislip on the new line. Councillors were <b>also</b> <b>aware</b> that King's College, Cambridge, owners of much of the land in the parish and lords of the manor, were planning to sell some for development. With this in mind, a vote was cast which went in favour of becoming an urban district. The new district was designed to better reflect to increase in development, as councillors felt a parish council would work slower than an urban district.|$|E

5|$|Amésqueta was {{extremely}} {{suspicious of the}} small canoes being supplied, knowing that the Itza had 30-man canoes; he was <b>also</b> <b>aware</b> that tricking enemies into small canoes was a favoured tactic among the lowland Maya to separate and kill Spanish intruders. He suspected that AjK'ixaw had betrayed them {{and that this was}} precisely what had happened to Díaz and his men. As nightfall approached, low on rations, in a vulnerable location and with no sign of Díaz and his men, Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby. In {{the early hours of the}} morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight, using just a few torches. They arrived back at Chakal on 25 March and from there retreated to San Pedro Mártir on 9 April, beset by worsening conditions, a hurricane, sickness and rumours of enemies. The battered expedition set up a base camp nine leagues (approximately 23.4miles or 37.7km) north of Mopan.|$|E
5|$|Burebista inevitably {{came into}} {{conflict}} with Rome. During the Roman civil war of 49–44 BC, Pompey gained the support of Burebista through Akornion of Dionysopolis. Pompey himself had recognized Burebista's and Dacia's might with their successful conquests against the Greek Black Sea cities. Caesar, however, ended any alliance between Pompey and Burebista at the Battle of Pharsalus. Caesar was <b>also</b> <b>aware</b> of the growing strength of the Dacians and had himself planned to lead an attack against Burebista. Burebista at this time had a force that may have numbered up to 200,000 men – though it is disputed whether this force was an actual military force {{or the number of}} able bodied men within the kingdom. Regardless, Dacia was a formidable power which Caesar perceived as a threat to Rome. But Caesar was never able to start his intended campaign because he was assassinated in 44 BC. Burebista met with the same fate as a civil uprising had him killed in either 45 or 44 BC.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Hergé's English {{language}} publishers, Methuen, were planning on translating and publishing The Black Island for the British market. Methuen believed that many British readers {{would find the}} depiction of Britain in the comic inaccurate and out-of-date, and drew {{up a list of}} 131 errors that they asked Hergé to rectify before they would publish it in English. They were <b>also</b> <b>aware</b> that the work would appear particularly dated when compared {{with some of the most}} recently published Adventures like Destination Moon and The Calculus Affair, which made use of advanced technologies in their plot. At the time, Hergé was busy producing the twenty-second Tintin story, Flight 714 to Sydney, and so did not have the time to undertake research into contemporary British society and culture. Instead, he sent his assistant Bob De Moor to Britain in October 1961, where he visited such sites as Batemans and the White Cliffs of Dover, making many observations as to new developments in clothing and architecture. While in England, De Moor sought out various contemporary uniforms to use as a basis for more accurate illustrations. A police constabulary lent him a police uniform, although when he asked British Rail if he could borrow one of their uniforms, their staff were suspicious and refused.|$|E

5|$|Raju and his team, now {{disguised}} as Sabarimala pilgrims, rent a van {{hoping to catch}} Jayan. Raju's teammate, Ameer Amanulla (Abu Salim), pretends to be an informer for Arif Bhai (Joy Mathew). He lures Jayan into a trap by telling him a gift from Arif is {{waiting for him in}} the van. Jayan is captured and interrogated by Raju who questions the 30,000 Dirham Jayan received from Arif in Dubai, as well as the circumstances surrounding the death of Rafeeq. Jayan reveals that Rafeeq was purposely pushed off a building to his death as part of Arif's master plan to transport the gold, thinking no one would suspect the gold was hidden in his casket. The trail leads Raju to the home of Ramesh's parents where Ramesh has been hiding under the protection of his mother, who is <b>also</b> <b>aware</b> of the smuggling. Raju takes Ramesh into custody along with others involved in the crime but he lets Ramesh go. It is eventually revealed that co-smuggler Shaji (Suresh Krishna), a young politician had deceived Unni and took the gold for himself.|$|E
5|$|The AEC commissioners {{asked for}} Major General Lauris Norstad, {{the head of}} the Operations and Plans Division, but neither the Chief of Staff of the Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, nor the Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, was willing to release him. The commissioners then {{selected}} McCormack. The job came with a promotion to brigadier general. The commissioners got the kind of officer that they wanted. McCormack was willing to accept the post as a staff job, and took a pragmatic approach to the custody issue. Like most military officers, he was convinced that the men who had to use the nuclear weapons in battle needed to have experience in their proper maintenance, storage and handling. However, he was <b>also</b> <b>aware</b> of the sensitivity of the issue of custody, which Congress had assigned to the AEC. Rather than continue to press for changes in the law, he accepted the situation as it was, and strove {{to make the best of}} it, working within the existing framework.|$|E
