40|$|Spatial {{skills are}} {{critical}} for robot teleoperation. For example, {{in order to make}} a judgment of relative direction when operating a robot remotely, one must take different perspectives and make decisions based on available spatial information. Training spatial skills is thus critical for robot teleoperation, yet, current training programs focus primarily on psycho-motoric skills of the task, and less on the essential cognitive aspects of spatial skills. This work addresses this need by considering previous findings on relative direction judgments in training robot teleoperation. We developed and tested a basic training paradigm of perspective taking skill targeting the cognitive skill rather than psycho-motoric skill. An experiment tested a basic training paradigm using a stationary robot, with a training group receiving perspective taking training and a control group without training, and both tested on a transfer test with the robot. The results show that participants who went through a targeted cognitive skill training reached mastery level during the training, and performed better than the control group in an <b>analogue</b> <b>transfer</b> of learning test. Moreover, results reveal that the training facilitated participants with initial poor perspective taking skills reach the level of the high-skilled participants in transfer test performance. The study validates the possibility to target only cognitive aspects of spatial skills and result in better robot teleoperation...|$|E
40|$|Idea {{generation}} {{is one of}} the major initial steps of the design process. Designers frequently use analogies to explain concepts, predict potential problems, and generate ideas. Analogous design can stimulate idea generation and lead to novelty and creativity. At present, there is little research that explores analogous design under the presence of irrelevant information, 'noise', or the effects of using analogies from semantically distant domains. An "Analogies and Noise" experiment extends previous findings which indicate that the use of two analogues instead of one can enhance analogous transfer. It tests whether this holds true for increased numbers of analogies. This study hypothesizes that <b>analogue</b> <b>transfer</b> improves with increasing number of example analogues and deteriorates under the presence of noise. The experiment evaluated this hypothesis by presenting designers with a design problem and a set of analogues and noise. Improvement was primarily measured by the rate of participants identifying the relevant high level principle (HLP). The results indicate that: (1) recognition of HLPs deteriorates under noise (2) increasing numbers of analogues under noise initially improves HLP recognition; however, once many items are present, designers are overwhelmed and the HLP recognition rate decreases (3) using two analogues is optimal for design and (4) noise cannot be defined as all those items without a functional feature relevant to the problem. A "Distant Domains" pilot experiment explores the use of distant-domain analogies. This study hypothesizes that distant domain analogies lead to more abstraction resulting in more creative designs. The experiment presented participants with a predetermined set of analogues then asked them to solve a problem. The set contained analogies from the problem domain and from a domain of varying distance. The following patterns were observed: (1) the number of emergent features peaked with near-domain analogies and decreased thereafter (2) the mean total number of ideas increased with increasing domain (3) designers deemed analogies from distant domains as 'less useful' and solutions generated using distant domains as 'less effective' and 'less practical'. These trends warrant future experimentation with an increased sample size...|$|E

40|$|Covalent {{attachment}} of cognate {{amino acid}} to the cognate tRNA {{is a prerequisite}} for the faithful synthesis of proteins in the cell. Aminoacylation of tRNA, catalyzed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), proceeds by a two-step reaction whereby amino acid is first activated and then transferred to the 32 ̆ 7 -ribose of tRNA. Serine hydroxamate (SerHX) is an interesting analogue of serine as it exhibits antimicrobial activity due to its inhibition of serylation in yeast and Escherichia coli. SerHX also mimics a noncognate substrate of yeast seryl-tRNA synthetase (ScSerRS) since it is efficiently activated and edited by this enzyme. However, whether this <b>analogue</b> is also <b>transferred</b> to tRNA during the second step of aminoacylation was not previously known.

We focus on the southern Bay of Biscay, a highly sensitive oceanographic area regarding the dynamics of the North Atlantic subpolar and subtropical gyres (SPG and STG respectively). This site furthermore offers unique sedimentary environments characterized by exceptional accumulation rates, enabling the study of Holocene archives at (infra) centennial scales. Our results mainly derive from planktonic foraminiferal association analysis on two cores from the southern Landes Plateau. These associations are used as the basis of modern <b>analogue</b> technique <b>transfer</b> functions to track past hydrographical changes. SST reconstructions were thus obtained at an exceptional resolution and compared to a compilation of Holocene records from the northeastern North Atlantic. From this regional perspective are shown fundamental timing differences between the gyre dynamics, nuancing classical views of a simple meridional overturning cell. Our study highlights that western Europe underwent significant oscillations of (annual) SST during the last 10  kyr. During well-known intervals of mild boreal climate, warm shifts of more than 3  °C per century are accurately concomitant with positive sea-surface temperature anomalies and rise of micropalaeontological indicators of gyre dynamics in the northern North Atlantic, pointing to periods of greater intensity of the North Atlantic Current (SPG cell especially).

A new technology approach is joining higher sensor accuracy and lower production costs by using a new Interposer / sensor interconnect technology applied on 300 mm wafer diameter without changing the sensor element itself. The higher accuracy is mainly covered by a multiple point program: (1) stress less assembly due interface silicon Interposer to silicon MEMS; (2) better Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) by polymer redistribution layer on the interposer (due to better wiring geometry and less parasitic capacities / inductivities); (3) reduction of mechanical stress by using flexible bar springs for mechanical decoupling of sensor and Interposer substrate; (4) additional stress reduction by using a polymer layer for mechanical decoupling of metal redistribution layer (RDL) and Interposer substrate. The cost efficiency even in small scale serial production based on: (1) 300 mm multi project wafer technology including warehouse ready system packaging; (2) a new MEMS contact technology, which gives technical benefit, smaller dimensions and simplifies the assembly of MEMS and ASIC (which are placed on a 2. 5 D-Interposer in order to enable a System In Package (SiP) {{as well as for}} higher sensor accuracy); (3) the flexible ASIC feature enables the integration of different MEMS with analogue signal output;(4) minor costs for integration of different sensors into the existing package.

Using a newly established method based on probability density functions (pdf-method), the temperature development throughout the last interglacial, the Eemian, is reconstructed for the two German sites Bispingen and Grobern and the French site La Grande Pile. The results are compared with previous reconstructions using other methods. After a steep increase in January as well as July temperatures in the early phase of the interglacial, the reconstructed most probable climate appears to be slightly warmer than today. While the temperature is reconstructed as relatively stable throughout the Eemian, a certain tendency towards cooler January temperatures is evident. January temperatures decreased from approx. 2 - 3 ° C {{in the early part}} to approx. - 3 ° C in the later part at Bispingen, and from approx. 2 ° C to approx. - 1 ° C at Grobern and La Grande Pile.

It deals with a {{beautiful}} method, developed in the mid-nineties by V. V. Bazhanov, S. L. Lukyanov and A. B. Zamolodchikov and, as such, called BLZ. This method can be interpreted as a field theory version of the quantum inverse scattering (QIS), also known as algebraic Bethe ansatz (ABA). Starting with the case of conformal field theories (CFT) we show how to build the field theory <b>analogues</b> of commuting <b>transfer</b> T matrices and Baxter Q-operators of integrable lattice models. These objects contain the complete information of the integrable structure of the theory, viz. the integrals of motion, and can be used, as we will show, to derive the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) and non-linear integral (NLIE) equations. This same method can be easily extended to the description of integrable structures of certain particular massive deformations of CFTs; these, in turn, can be described as quantum group reductions of the quantum sine-Gordon model and it is an easy step to include this last theory in the framework of BLZ approach. Finally we show an interesting and surprising connection of the BLZ structures with classical objects emerging from the study of classical integrable models via the inverse scattering transform method. This connection goes under the name of ODE/IM correspondence and we will present it for the specific case of quantum sine-Gordon model only. Comment: 51 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|Posttranslational protein {{methylation}} {{has been}} connected to important regulatory mechanisms in cells. Especially {{in context with}} the histone code, the methylation of arginin and lysine residues on histone proteins and their function in the regulation of gene expression has been studied in detail over the past years. The ubiquitous cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionin (AdoMet) is the major methyl donor for enzymatic methylation reactions. Protein methyltransferases (MTases) catalyse methyl group transfer to target amino acid residues. However, the methyl group is a poor chemical reporter. To transfer larger functional groups than the methyl group to target positions, synthetic AdoMet analogues have been synthesized which have already been used with DNA-MTases for sequence-specific modification of DNA. The AdoMet analogues carry extended, activated side chains replacing the methyl group. With these synthetic cofactor analogues and protein MTases, a two-step labeling system for proteins was established in this work. Target proteins shall be modified by transferring the extended side chains carrying functional groups from synthetic AdoMet analogues with protein MTases. The functional groups are subsequently labeled in a bioorthogonal chemical reaction. The fungal histone lysine protein MTase Dim- 5 is specific for H 3 K 9 and was chosen for test reactions with the synthetic AdoMet analogues. A fluorescein-labeled histone peptide encompassing amino acids 1 - 15 from histone H 3 served as a substrate. Extended side chains from synthetic AdoMet <b>analogues</b> could be <b>transferred</b> to the peptide by Dim- 5. A new cofactor with a terminal alkyne as the functional group was synthesized particularly for the application in the chemical labeling reaction. The extended side chain of this AdoMet <b>analogue</b> AdoEnIn was <b>transferred</b> to the histone peptide by Dim- 5. By transferring the extended side chain, a terminal alkyne was enzymatically introduced to the substrate peptide. An azide-derivatized reporter can be coupled with the alkinylated peptide in a Cu(I) catalyzed cycloaddition reaction, a so called ‘Click-Reaction’. This coupling reaction is of bioorthogonal character and {{can be applied to}} biological systems in vitro. Using the click reaction, the alkinylated peptide was biotinylated. After optimizing the reaction conditions for the enzymatic side chain transfer and the subsequent chemical biotinylation with the histone peptide, the modification-and-labeling system should be applied to full length proteins. Histone H 3 was modified with the AdoEnIn side chain by Dim- 5 and biotinylated via the click reaction. The reaction mixture was seperated by SDS-PAGE and detected by a Western-Blot using peroxidase-coupled avidin. The analogue AdoEnIn could also serve as a cofactor for eukaryotic protein MTases. In contrast to prokaryotic protein MTases, these are only active in protein complexes with several subunits. A human ASH 2 complex contains MLL 4, a H 3 K 4 protein MTase. Histone H 3 was alkinylated with AdoEnIn by the ASH 2 complex and biotinylated via the click reaction. The biotinylated histone was detected by a western-blot using the peroxidase-avidin conjugate. A C-terminal fragment of MLL 4 carrying the catalytic site was able to modify histone H 3 with the AdoEnIn side chain, chemical biotinylation could be detected in a western-blot. The enzymatic activities of endogenous protein MTases in cell extracts were used for AdoEnIn side chain transfer to their specific substrates. Labeling with biotin allowed the detection of the modified proteins in western blots. In addition, the biotinylated proteins could either be isolated with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and subsequently silver stained in SDS gels or were alternatively analyzed by mass spectrometry...|$|R

Using fluoroberyllate analogues, the ground states of βPGM were investigated, establishing that at high pH, BeF 2 OH- replaces BeF 3 - as a phosphoryl <b>transfer</b> <b>analogue.</b> Importantly, the BeF 2 OH- moiety preferentially binds βG 1 P, allowing for study of the ground state for step 1 of βPGM's reaction coordinate, previously inaccessible. This further established the molecular details for how βPGM performs catalysis on both orientations of the hexose, and highlights how hydrogen bonds between the substrate and the phosphate enables the nucleophile to approach the anionic phosphate {{in the absence of}} the general base. Separately, an intermediate complex of βPGM was established through mutation of the general base. Kinetic investigation reveals that the D 10 N mutant is catalytically active, yet after exposure to substrates a βG 1, 6 bisP complex forms. Taken with fluoroberyllate and fluoromagnesate analogue complexes of βPGM, this demonstrates once again how phosphoryl transfer involves in-line nucleophilic attack, with an associative concerted mechanism, where the phosphorous atom migrates 1. 2 Å between axial oxygen atoms. A full backbone assignment was performed, and ms - µs dynamics investigated by 15 N relaxation dispersion. Lastly, the functional importance of structural differences between βPGM and PSP were explored by site directed mutagenesis. Substrate and product complexes were formed with D 13 N PSP, confirming the generally applicability of this general base mutation for studying trapped states in enzyme-catalysed phosphoryl transfer. Meanwhile, assignment of the MgF 3 - TSA complex for the hydrolysis reaction was completed, and dynamics of PSP for apo and MgF 3 - TSA species probed. ...|$|R

All four fluorescent <b>analogues</b> were readily <b>transferred</b> from defatted BSA to the plasma membrane during incubation at 4 degrees C. When cells treated with C 5 -DMB-GlcCer were washed, warmed to 37 degrees C, and subsequently incubated with defatted BSA to remove fluorescent lipid at the cell surface, strong fluorescence was observed at the Golgi apparatus, as well as weaker labeling at the nuclear envelope and other intracellular membranes. Similar results were obtained with C 5 -DMB- galactosylceramide, except that labeling of the Golgi apparatus was weaker than with C 5 -DMB-GlcCer. Internalization of C 5 -DMB-GlcCer was not inhibited by various treatments, including ATP depletion or warming to 19 degrees C, and biochemical analysis demonstrated that the lipid was not metabolized during its internalization. However, accumulation of C 5 -DMB-GlcCer at the Golgi apparatus was reduced when cells were treated with a nonfluorescent analogue of glucosylceramide, suggesting that accumulation of C 5 -DMB-GlcCer at the Golgi apparatus was a saturable process. In contrast, cells treated with C 5 -DMB-analogues of sphingomyelin or lactosylceramide internalized the fluorescent lipid into a punctate pattern of fluorescence during warming at 37 degrees C, and this process was temperature and energy dependent. These results with C 5 -DMB-sphingomyelin and C 5 -DMB-lactosylceramide were analogous to those obtained with another fluorescent analogue of sphingomyelin in which labeling of endocytic vesicles and plasma membrane lipid recycling were documented (Koval, M., and R. E. Pagano. 1990. J. Cell Biol. 111 : 429 - 442). Incubation of perforated cells with C 5 -DMB- sphingomyelin resulted in prominent labeling of the nuclear envelope and other intracellular membranes, similar to the pattern observed with C 5 -DMB-GlcCer in intact cells. These observations are consistent with the transbilayer movement of fluorescent analogues of glucosylceramide and galactosylceramide at the plasma membrane and early endosomes of human skin fibroblasts, and suggest that both endocytic and nonendocytic pathways are used in the internalization of these lipids from the plasma membrane...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{presented in}} this paper applies to experimental situations where observers or objects to be studied (both stationary, with respect to each other) are located in environments the optical thickness of which is strongly different. By their large optical thickness, non-transparent media are clearly distinguished from their transparent counterparts. Non-transparent media comprise thin metallic films, packed or fluidised beds, the Earth’s crust, and even dark clouds and other cosmological objects. As a representative example, a non-transparent slab is subjected to transient disturbances, and a rigorous analysis is presented whether physical time reasonably could be constructed under such condition. The analysis incorporates mapping functions that correlate physical events, e, in non-transparent media, with their images, f(e), tentatively located on a standard physical time scale. The analysis demonstrates, however, that physical time, in its rigorous sense, does not exist under non-transparency conditions. A proof of this conclusion is attempted in three steps: i) the theorem “there is no time without space and events” is accepted, (ii) images f[e(s,t) ] do not constitute a dense, uncountably infinite set, and (iii) sets of images that are not uncountably infinite do not create physical time but only time-like sequences. As a consequence, mapping f[e(s,t) ] in non-transparent space does not create physical analogues to the mathematical structure of the ordered, dense half-set R+ of real numbers, and reverse mapping, f- 1 f[e(s,t) ] would not allow unique identification and reconstruction of original events from their images. In these cases, causality and determinism, as well as invariance of physical processes under time reversal, might be violated. Existence of time holes could be possible, as follows from the sequence of images, f[e(s,t) ], that is not uncountably infinite, in contrast to R+. Practical impacts are expected for understanding physical diffusion-like, radiative transfer processes, stability models to protect superconductors against quenchs or for description of their transient local pair density and critical currents. Impacts would be expected also in mathematical formulations (differential equations) of classical physics, in relativity and perhaps in quantum mechanics, all as far as transient processes in non-transparent space would be concerned. An interesting problem is whether temporal cloaking (a time hole) in a transparent medium, as very recently reported in the literature, {{can be explained by the}} present analysis. The analysis is not restricted to objects of laboratory dimensions: Because of obviously existing radiation <b>transfer</b> <b>analogues,</b> it is tempting to discuss consequences also for much larger structures in particular if an origin of time is postulated...|$|R
40|$|ATP synthase (F 1 Fo-ATPase) catalyses the {{production}} of ATP from ADP and orthophosphate by using the proton motive force established across a membrane by photosynthesis or oxidative phosphorylation. The ATP synthase of eukaryotic mitochondria {{is located in the}} inner membrane and is comprised of two domains. The globular F 1 domain protrudes into the matrix and it contains the catalytic sites for ATP synthesis. The membrane bound Fo domain contains a proton channel. The two domains are connected by central and peripheral stalks. When F 1 is removed from the complex, it can hydrolyse ATP but not synthesise it. It is composed of nine subunits with the stoichiometry α 3 β 3 γδε. The α and β subunits are arranged alternately round the symmetric γ subunit, which, with the δ and ε subunits, forms the central stalk. Catalysis occurs by a rotary mechanism where rotation in Fo, induced by the passage of protons, is transmitted to F 1 via the central stalk. The rotation of the γ subunit induces conformational changes in the catalytic β subunits that lead to the synthesis of ATP. The three catalytic sites proceed through three major and well defined conformations sequentially, and no two sites are the same at any one time. The peripheral stalk counters the tendency of the α 3 β 3 subcomplex to rotate with the γ subunit. The ATP synthase of mitochondria is regulated by an inhibitor protein, IF 1, that prevents hydrolysis of ATP when the proton motive force collapses. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two inhibitor proteins, YIF 1 and STF 1. The states of oligomerisation of their active and inactive forms have been investigated. In contrast to bovine IF 1, which is active as a dimer, the yeast inhibitors are active as monomers around pH 7. 0. Like the bovine protein, they form inactive oligomers at higher pH values. While many of features of the mechanism of catalysis of the ATP synthase are well understood, {{it is now clear that}} there are many sub-steps within the cycle. Some of them have been revealed by <b>analogues</b> of phosphoryl <b>transfer.</b> Bovine mitochondrial F 1 -ATPase inhibited with ADP and magnesium fluoride forms a transition state analogue complex. Its structure was solved to 2. 5 Å resolution. The βTP and βDP catalytic sites both contain ADP and MgF 3 -. The βE subunit binds ADP, despite being in an essentially open conformation. The structure represents a new sub-step in the catalytic cycle just before the release of the substrates of ATP hydrolysis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2008. This {{dissertation}} {{involves the}} experimental and numerical analysis of heat transfer on a transonic high turning angle gas turbine blade, {{which has been}} performed on the supersonic cascade experimental facility at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN), {{as part of the}} continuous research and development project run under ARMSCOR. Efforts have been made to keep constant maintenance on the experimental rig. This now functional rig was used to generate experimental results, which were used to validate numerical models created using the commercially available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package of FLUENT. The facility at UKZN is a continuously running cascade system, which consists of a plenum run under vacuum pressure and houses a four-blade cascade. One of these SMR- 95 turbine blades is instrumented with thin-film gauges, which allow heat transfer measurement via a heat transfer analogy through electrical circuit boards. This blade is interchangeable with an instrumented blade with pressure tappings along its span for pressure distribution tests. This facility was used to validate flow measurements, and results compared to previous test data conducted on the rig, using two pressure transducers, a scanivalve and a data acquisition system with LabView software. The method of generating heat transfer measurement results involved pre-chilling the test blade in a cooling box, before rapidly plunging it directly into a hot-air stream. Re-instrumented and more sensitive thin-film gauges would react resistively according to the temperature change. The heat transfer coefficient distribution was calculated using LabView. The turbulence intensity at the inlet of the cascade was varied using a grid of rods of varying diameter. For 15 % turbulence intensity, there was a 16 % overall increase in heat transfer on the pressure side, and 25 % increase on the suction side. For 25. 5 % turbulence intensity, there was an overall increase of 23 % on the pressure side and 40 % on the suction side. The results compared favourably to that of previous results generated by Stieger (1998). The experimental results were used to validate and compare to the CFD model developed in FLUENT. Improvements were made with the meshes developed previously, and results obtained showed that the general trend of distribution was similar, although certain models varied in the correct prediction of magnitude. This research includes a comprehensive study of various methods of numerical heat transfer measurement techniques, which would be used to replace the current ageing electrical heat <b>transfer</b> <b>analogue</b> method used at UKZN...|$|R
