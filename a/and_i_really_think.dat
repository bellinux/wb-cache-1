500|$|Cyrus became {{involved}} with Bolt once she was cast as Penny, Bolt's owner. Filmmakers asked Cyrus to write a song for herself and John Travolta, who stars as Bolt. She co-wrote the song {{with the aid of}} Jeffrey Steele, who also produced the track, {{in a short period of}} time as they had a due date. The film's settings vary in cities throughout the United States, which Cyrus thought she could capture in the song. [...] "Not just make it something that sounds from Hollywood and really produced, but we could add a little country twang to it," [...] she said. Cyrus said the writing process was easy. Before the song's completion, Travolta agreed to sing it, believing [...] "Well, it will be a cute song, whatever it is." [...] After listening to the song, he was surprised at Cyrus' songwriting abilities. [...] "She's really gifted at writing, and she really wanted to write something good for me as the character Bolt, so she went out of her way with her writing partner to come up with something good, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> they pulled it off", Travolta told MTV News.|$|E
500|$|According to Lamonica, the 1965 {{team had}} a new emphasis: [...] "In '64 we had {{depended}} a lot on Gilchrist and our running attack to carry us...But that all changed in '65. [...] The Bills had traded Gilchrist in the off season to the Denver Broncos. So {{we went to a}} pass-oriented game more that season than we ever had before. [...] We not only went to our receivers, but we threw a lot to our running backs. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> it brought out the best in Jack that year." [...] In 1965, the Bills finished with a 10–3–1 record. Kemp finished the season second in the league in pass completions. In the 1965 AFL Championship Game, Buffalo defeated the Chargers 23–0; for Kemp, the victory was special because it came against his former team. Kemp's role in leading the Bills to a repeat championship without Gilchrist and with star receiver Elbert Dubenion playing only three games earned him a share of the AFL MVP awards that he split with former Charger teammate, Paul Lowe. Kemp also won the Associated Press award and the Championship Game Most Valuable Player award.|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, {{speculation}} arose that Walton {{had taken}} a medical leave; however, Nelson Branco of TV Guide Canada reported {{that she had been}} asked to accept a salary cut and had decided to leave. The soap opera issued a casting call for Jill, describing her as [...] "late '50s, Caucasian, female. This [...] woman is a smart and confident CEO of a successful company. She is a mother and grandmother who wants what is best for her family." [...] However, soon after, Walton was able to sign a new contract to continue her portrayal of Jill. She later clarified her departure as having to do with [...] "family and this economy". She stated: [...] "I felt so bad that so many people have lost their jobs, that, all of a sudden, I thought: 'This is really silly. I have a wonderful job <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> I owe it to myself and my family to continue on.'" [...] In February 2012, Walton signed a new contract with the soap opera, which would continue her portrayal of the role for an unspecified amount of time. The actress was then announced to be taking a leave of absence beginning that April, slated to last six months. [...] She made her return on November 2, 2012. After her return, Walton confirmed in an interview with Soap Opera Digest that she had voluntarily dropped to recurring status to allow for more time with her family.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2010, Wada, {{asked about}} his opinion on [...] "big-budget, long-in-development" [...] Square Enix games such as Final Fantasy XIII, noted: [...] "hether {{we are going to}} {{continue}} to internally create this type of game remains to be seen, because I actually feel that the team that was involved with Final Fantasy XIII should next move on to create and generate some 'next generation' forms of play. Internally and externally I feel there's an expectation of Square Enix to offer something new, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that the Final Fantasy team could create something completely different, but at the moment they're strictly catering to the particular audience they have now." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his memoirs, Holloway III {{complained that}} [...] "there {{has often been}} a tacit {{presumption}} {{that my father was}} in a position to advance my career as I gained seniority in the Navy. On the contrary, as a retired officer he had little or no influence over his own future, much less mine." [...] As an example of this presumption, when President Richard M. Nixon approved Holloway III's nomination to succeed Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. as chief of naval operations, Zumwalt believed that Nixon acquiesced mainly to avoid overruling the recommendation of his secretary of defense, but that, [...] "In addition, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> this was a factor, Mr. Nixon remembered Jimmy's father from his own period of naval service." ...|$|E

5000|$|Sometime {{between the}} second and third session, Dylan {{approached}} Robbie Robertson and Garth Hudson of the Band to complete some overdub work on the basic tracks, but as Robertson recalled: [...] "We did talk about doing some overdubbing on it, but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> liked it when <b>I</b> heard it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> right about overdubbing on it.
