50|$|Roger A. Morse, Ph.D. (July 5, 1927 - May 12, 2000) was a bee {{biologist}} who taught many beekeepers both the rudiments and the finer practices, through his research and publications. During his long career, three new parasites of the honeybee, <b>acarine</b> <b>mite,</b> varroa mite and African {{small hive beetle}} {{were introduced to the}} United States. These, along with the Africanized honeybee and pesticide kills were all important beekeeping issues. Morse was extensively involved in research on each of these and provided guidance to the beekeeping industry.|$|E

40|$|Of 656 {{asthmatic}} patients referred {{specifically for}} allergy assessments, 544 (84 percent) gave positive immediate skin prick tests {{to at least}} one of 22 common allergens used routinely. Comparison of these skin test positive patients with the 102 (16 percent) who were skin test negative showed a number of significant differences. The majority of the skin test positive patients (52 percent) were less than 10 {{years old at the time}} of onset of the asthma, whereas, of the skin test negative patients, 56 percent were aged over 30 years at the time of onset. Seventy per cent report rhinitis compared with 48 per cent of the skin test negative patients, and 29 per cent reported infantile eczema compared with 9 per cent. Symptoms attributed to house dust, pollens, and animals were noted two to three times more frequently by the skin test positive patients, while corticosteroid drugs had been used more commonly by the skin test negative patients (45 percent compared with 35 percent). No significant differences were observed with the other factors studied, namely, history of urticaria or angio-oedema, family history of "allergic" disease, and awareness of sensitivity to foods, aspirin or penicillin. Prick test reactions in the skin test positive patients were most commonly seen to house dust or the <b>acarine</b> <b>mite,</b> Dermatophagoides farinae (82 percent), followed by pollens (66 percent), animal danders (38 percent), foods (16 percent), Aspergillus fumigatus (16 percent), and other moulds (21 percent).

40|$|The {{practice}} of broadacre, dryland farming {{is known to}} affect the physico-chemical structure of the soil but our knowledge or {{its impact on the}} biological structure is rudimentary. The soil <b>acarine</b> (<b>mite)</b> communities which inhabit these soils display a variety of responses to this agricultural practice. With the increasing focus on developing ecologically sustainable agricultural techniques, an understanding of the soil acari becomes increasingly important. This study investigated the impact of two agricultural practices (designated here us Conventional and Non-Conventional) upon the abundance and diversity of the soil acari. Conventional agricultural practice involved broad scale chemical application to weeds and soil and conventional tillage. Non-Conventional agricultural practice involved chemical application to plant foliage only, and minimum tillage by disk ploughing. Comparisons of the soil mite communities were made with the mite communities of an adjacent bushland remnant. Total acarine abundance was highest in the two agricultural sites and was positively correlated with organic matter. However, species richness in these sites was 40 % less than that in the Bushland Remnant site. Mites from the Orders Prostigmata and Astigmata were numerically dominant at all three sites. The Non-Conventional und Bushland Remnant sites were most similar when comparing the relative percentage abundance of the orders. Species level analyses revealed that the one species from the prostigmatid family Eupodidae, and one species from the astigmatid family Acaridae, increased in abundance with increasing agricultural disturbance. Both species were positively correlated with total organic carbon. The effect of fertilizer and herbicide application to species abundance is also considered. This study identified differences in mite communities between the Conventional and Non-Conventional agricultural sites, which placed the Non-Conventional site in an intermediate position between the Conventional and Bushland Remnant site...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increased}} planting of E. globulus monoculture plantations, concerns surround the impact these mass plantings {{will have on}} the soil environment and wider ecosystem. Soil and litter mites are the dominant saprophages of terrestrial ecosystems, contributing to decomposition processes through their comminution and grazing activities. Despite the importance of mites to decomposition processes, there have been no investigations to date of the litter and soil communities under these plantations within Australia. This study investigated the impact of Eucalyptus globulus subsp. globulus (Tasmanian bluegum) monoculture plantations on the diversity and abundance of the soil and litter <b>acarine</b> (<b>mite)</b> fauna. Mite communities under three 8 year-old E. globulus plantations sited on reclaimed pastureland were compared with an adjacent native E. marginata (jarrah) forest and a grazed pasture in the mediterranean-type region of southwest Western Australia. Sites were sampled in spring 1997 and new sites randomly selected in autumn 1998. Large seasona 1 variations in abundance and diversity were found between the sampling periods of spring 1997 and autumn 1998, influenced considerably by soil moisture. Species richness was consistently higher in both the soil and litter layers under native jarrah forest, with the E. globulus plantations intermediate in species richness between the native forest and grazed pasture. A total of 114 mite species/morphospecies was recognized; 16 Mesostigmata, 52 Prostigmata, 45 Oribatida (Cryptostigmata) and 1 Astigmata. Species diversity in the surface litter was higher under the native forest, reflecting the greater heterogeneity of the litter. Diversity in the underlying soil was similar for the native forest and E. globulus plantation, although there were considerable differences in species richness. Soil diversity in the pasture was very poor in comparison to the two forest systems, reflecting the absence of a litter layer and reduced niche dimensions. The monospecific E. globulus litter possibly reduced niche variety by simplifying the physical habitat and reducing the variety of resources available for the saprophagous fauna, of which the oribatid mites are a major component. Consequently, the number of families represented in the microphytophagous, phytophagous and predator functional groups under the E. globulus plantation may have been reduced. The most common oribatid families under the plantation were those often reported from disturbed habitats, Oppiidae and Tectocepheidae, and those common in many habitats, Oppiinae and Oppiellinae. An important management implication arising from this study is that these plantations would harbour a more diverse mite fauna if planted as a mixed tree stratum...|$|E

50|$|There is {{no clear}} {{evidence}} that A. m. ligustica is more resistant to <b>acarine</b> <b>mites</b> than the Northern dark bee. They also appear to be less tolerant of Nosema than Northern dark bees. They are unable to retain faeces in the gut for long periods and require more frequent cleaning flights than the dark bees.

25|$|<b>Acarine</b> <b>mites</b> are {{commonly}} controlled with grease patties (typically made {{from one part}} vegetable shortening mixed with three to four parts powdered sugar) placed on the top bars of the hive. The bees come to eat the sugar and pick up traces of shortening, which disrupts the mite's ability to identify a young bee. Some of the mites waiting to transfer to a new host remain on the original host. Others transfer to a random bee—a proportion of which will die of other causes before the mite can reproduce.|$|R

5|$|Earwigs are {{regularly}} preyed upon by birds, {{and like many}} other insect species they are prey for insectivorous mammals, amphibians, lizards, centipedes, assassin bugs, and spiders. European naturalists have observed bats preying upon earwigs. Their primary insect predators are parasitic species of Tachinidae, or tachinid flies, whose larvae are endoparasites. One species of tachinid fly, Triarthria setipennis, has been demonstrated to be successful as a biological control of earwigs for almost a century. Another tachinid fly and parasite of earwigs, Ocytata pallipes, has shown promise as a biological control agent as well. The common predatory wasp, the yellow jacket (Vespula maculifrons), preys upon earwigs when abundant. A small species of roundworm, Mermis nigrescens, is known to occasionally parasitize earwigs that have consumed roundworm eggs with plant matter. At least 26 species of parasitic fungus from the order Laboulbeniales have been found on earwigs. The eggs and nymphs are also cannibalized by other earwigs. A species of tyroglyphoid mite, Histiostoma polypori (Histiostomatidae, Astigmata), are observed on common earwigs, sometimes in great densities; however, this mite feeds on earwig cadavers and not its live earwig transportation. Hippolyte Lucas observed scarlet <b>acarine</b> <b>mites</b> on European earwigs.|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} {{petroleum}} hydrocarbons {{have been used}} in horticulture. The most important applications have been in the field of economic entomology and emulsions of petroleum hydrocarbons are widely employed for the control of insect pests such as scale insects and <b>acarine</b> <b>mites.</b> Such emulsions are widely used on citrus, on dormant deciduous trees, and deciduous trees in various stages of development. Hydrocarbons with different physical properties are required for these different applications, depending on the requirements for safety, efficiency, and their provision at a minimum cost. There have, however, been other applications in which physiological results are sought. It has been the practice of many apple growers to apply emulsified petroleum hydrocarbons to stimulate the break of dormancy in the trees in spring. Similarly sprays of petroleum hydrocarbons have been used with a view to "waterproofing" cherries near maturity, so that in the event of rain, the absorption of water is limited, and the ensuing cracking of fruit is reduced. Yet again, there are useful applications in the storage of fruit. "Superficial scald" of Granny Smith apples is eliminated by using oiled wraps, while wilting of other fruits such as apples and all kinds of citrus in storage, is delayed by means of films of petroleum hydrocarbons. Two research projects in these fields with which the writer has been concerned over the period 1940 - 44 inclusive, are described below. They have been confined in the main to Victoria, but conditioned in many details by knowledge of horticultural problems in other States and directed towards an Australian wide application. The work falls logically into two sections - (1) Physiological - The application of emulsified petroleum hydrocarbons to vines, with a view to delaying the breaking of dormancy, thus passing the period of maximum frost liability in the dormant condition. (2) Insecticidal - The development of an insecticidal composition consisting essentially of dinitrocresol dissolved in petroleum hydrocarbons, and its possible applications to Australian horticulture. The former section was investigated by the writer in conjunction with officers of the C. S. I. R., Merbein; notably Mr. D. V. "'alters. The writer played a major part in the planning and performance of the trial, and the estimation and examination of results, but it cannot be claimed as individual research. The latter section was entirely planned and carried out by the writer and has {{led to the development of}} a horticultural insecticide which has been applied commercially for several years with success.

5000|$|Solitary bees produce neither honey nor beeswax. They are {{immune from}} <b>acarine</b> and Varroa <b>mites,</b> but {{have their own}} unique parasites, pests, and diseases. The nesting habits of many Osmia lend {{themselves}} to easy cultivation, {{and a number of}} Osmia are commercially propagated {{in different parts of the}} world to improve pollination in fruit and nut production. Commercial pollinators include O. lignaria, O. bicornis, O. cornuta, O. cornifrons, O. ribifloris, and O. californica. They are used both as an alternative to and as an augmentation for European honey bees. Mason bees used for orchard and other agricultural applications are all readily attracted to nesting holes - reeds, paper tubes, nesting trays, or drilled blocks of wood; in their dormant season they can be transported as intact nests (tubes, blocks, etc.), or as loose cocoons. [...] As is characteristic of solitary bees, Osmia are very docile and rarely sting when handled (only under distress such as when wet or squeezed), their sting is small and not painful, and their stinger is unbarbed.|$|R
40|$|Many <b>acarine</b> (tick and <b>mite)</b> {{species are}} ectoparasites of humans, {{livestock}} and domestic pets, where they spread disease and impact adversely on health. They are normally controlled {{through the application}} of acaricides; however, the prolonged use of individual compounds has resulted in many species developing resistance to specific pesticides. This thesis describes investigations into the molecular properties that determine the resistance to and selectivity of pyrethroids, an important class of pesticides that act on the voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) of arthropod neurons. Comparison of insect and acarine VGSC sequences, coupled with molecular modelling studies, have identified a residue at amino-acid position 933 (M. domestica numbering) found within a putative pyrethroid binding pocket that may contribute to a greater selectivity of pyrethroids with comparatively larger halogenated groups for acarine VGSCs compared to those of insects. This is due to the presence of a smaller glycine residue at position 933 in acarine channels, compared to a cysteine residue in insect channels, which may enhance the binding of such pyrethroids (O'Reilly et al., 2014). This model is supported by the findings of Jonsson et al 2010, that R. microplus cattle ticks carrying the amino acid substitution G 933 V, are resistant to the pyrethroid flumethrin, which has a comparatively larger halogenated group, but not the pyrethroid cypermethrin, which has a comparatively smaller halogenated group. Work in this thesis describes progress made in the investigation of such specificity; involving sequencing studies, two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology in Xenopus laevis oocytes involving insect and acarine VGSCs, and whole arthropod bioassays. While this work cannot conclusively disprove the model proposed by O’Reilly et al 2014, it suggests that the mechanisms of selectivity for pyrethroids in arthropods may involve the interplay of several factors, rather than being solely based upon structural variations in their VGSCs...|$|R
