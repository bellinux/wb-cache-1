This <b>airborne</b> <b>dust</b> is considered an aerosol and once in {{the atmosphere}}, it can produce strong local radiative forcing.

25|$|Meltwater around Greenland may {{transport}} {{nutrients in}} both dissolved and particulate phases to the ocean. Measurements {{of the amount}} of iron in meltwater from the Greenland ice sheet show that extensive melting of the ice sheet might add an amount of this micronutrient to the Atlantic Ocean equivalent to that added by <b>airborne</b> <b>dust.</b> However much of the particles and iron derived from glaciers around Greenland may be trapped within the extensive fjords that surround the island and, unlike the HNLC Southern ocean where iron is an extensive limiting micronutrient, biological production in the North Atlantic is subject only to very spatially and temporally limited periods of iron limitation. Nonetheless high productivity is observed in the immediate vicinity of major marine terminating glaciers around Greenland and this is attributed to meltwater inputs driving the upwelling of seawater rich in macronutrients.|$|E

25|$|Company {{directors}} {{selected the}} western half of Forest Park {{as the site}} of the fair, sparking a real estate boom in the area. To meet anticipated demand by visitors, several hotels were constructed in downtown and the Central West End, and temporary lodging was erected in the fairgrounds itself by E.M. Statler (who used profits from the facility to found Statler Hotels). While the fair was under construction, {{it became clear that the}} western half of the park would not suffice for the size of the fair, so company directors leased the campus of Washington University in St. Louis and several other parcels of land, bringing the total fairgrounds to an area of 1,272 acres. Streetcar and rail service to the area was improved, and a new filtration system was implemented to improve the clarity of the St. Louis water supply. Other infrastructure improvements made for the fair included a wooden bridge at Kingshighway crossing the rail yards of Mill Creek Valley, and a street paving program that improved air quality by reducing <b>airborne</b> <b>dust</b> particulates.|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{investigated}} {{the relationship of}} bituminous coal seam parameters {{and the amount of}} <b>airborne</b> respirable <b>dust</b> generated at longwalls. Dust and coal samples were obtained from 20 longwalls operating in geographically representative coalfields throughout the United States. Statistical analyses of coal seam parameters and <b>airborne</b> respirable <b>dust</b> measurements indicate a likely causal relationship between seam type and respirable dust. Low-ash, high-volatile coal seams were associated with higher <b>airborne</b> respirable <b>dust</b> levels. A negative linear correlation (significant at the 95 -pct confidence level) was observed between the seam's ash content and <b>airborne</b> respirable <b>dust,</b> explaining up to 18 pct (R 2 = 0. 18) of headgate dust level variation and up to 15 pct of tailgate dust level variation. Volatile matter was found to have a positive linear correlation with tailgate dust level, explaining 16 pct of the variation. Further data examination indicates that these relationships with dust are most likely nonlinear, because of improved R 2 values over the linear correlations. However, a notable portion of longwall dust production is influenced by other operational parameters, so additional research under more controlled conditions is needed to determine the seam's causative functions...|$|R

2500|$|By taking {{multiple}} {{images of}} the sky at different distances from the Sun, scientists were able to determine {{that the size of}} the particles in the pink haze was about one micrometre in radius. [...] The color of some soils was similar to that of an iron oxyhydroxide phase which would support the theory of a warmer and wetter climate in the past. Pathfinder carried a series of magnets to examine the magnetic component of the dust. Eventually, {{all but one of the}} magnets developed a coating of dust. [...] Since the weakest magnet did not attract any soil, it was concluded that the <b>airborne</b> <b>dust</b> did not contain pure magnetite or just one type of maghemite. The dust probably was an aggregate possibly cemented with ferric oxide (Fe2O3). Using much more sophisticated instruments, Mars Spirit rover found that magnetite could explain the magnetic nature of the dust and soil on Mars.

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that <b>airborne</b> Asian <b>dust</b> may not only play an {{important}} role in the regional radiation budget, but also influence the air quality over North America through long-range transport. In this paper, we use satellite data to investigate the long-term variability of <b>airborne</b> Asian <b>dust</b> as well as the daily variation of the dust aerosol distribution. By combining the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) aerosol index with National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) wind data, our analysis shows a strong correlation between the generation of dust storms in the region and the passage of springtime weather fronts. This is consistent with earlier studies performed by other researchers. According to both the Nimbus- 7 and Earth-Probe TOMS data the Takla Makan desert, the Gobi desert, and the and region of Inner Mongolia are major sources of the eastward-flowing <b>airborne</b> Asian <b>dust.</b> Heavily populated areas in eastern China (e. g., Beijing) are often on the primary path of the dust storms originating in these desert regions.

Compared with the late 1980 s records, pH values declined significantly from approximately 8 in the 1980 s to below 7 in mid- 1990 s. Such rapid and drastic changes were attributed to fast industrial development that released a large amount of pollutants. Subsequent tough control on pollutant emission partly restored pH values back to above 7 in the late 1990 s. The pH and rainfall chemical analyses indicate that alkaline rain in this continental arid region is caused by <b>airborne</b> <b>dusts</b> which originate from local alkaline soils.

40|$|Enclosed {{operator}} cabs {{are widely}} used on mobile excavation equipment in the mining and construction industries.

Most cab designs achieve {{heating and air conditioning}} effectiveness by recirculating most of the interior cabin airflow, with a smaller portion of the outside air added to the cab as makeup air. Both the recirculated cab airflow and exterior makeup air added to the cabin should be efficiently filtered, with the makeup air positively pressurizing the cab interior. Ideally, operator cab air filters should provide at least 99 % capture efficiency for dust particles as small as 0. 3 microm aerodynamic diameters. These higher efficiency air filters provide good dust control for the equipment operator, but tend to accumulate dust more quickly than lower efficiency air filters.
