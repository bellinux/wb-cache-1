5|$|During the {{funerals}} of Soviet leaders {{there was a}} custom of displaying their decorations on velvet cushions, which were carried in the procession behind the coffin. This task was traditionally given to an escort of senior officers, each carrying <b>a</b> <b>cushion</b> with one decoration on it. However, as Brezhnev had {{more than two hundred}} decorations, several were placed on each cushion. Brezhnev's funeral officer escort ultimately included forty-four persons.|$|E

5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless {{body fluid}} {{found in the}} brain and spinal cord. It is {{produced}} in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as <b>a</b> <b>cushion</b> or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.|$|E

5|$|The sheep {{industry}} in Spain was {{an instance of}} migratory flock management, with large homogenous flocks ranging over the entire country. The management model used in England was quite different but had a similar importance to economy of the country.

5|$|Everyone sits in silence, {{waiting for}} Parsons's manager to arrive. Jan {{suggests}} that Graham blow up another balloon for Tamsin. Sally, Si and Graham realise that, {{with the camera}} footage they have, they can blow up all the purple balloons and sell them to multiple bidders. Jan screams when she sees movement in Tamsin's bedroom, and it is realised that Frankie is still alive. Jan takes Tamsin {{out of the room}} and the remaining three agree, after panicked discussion, that they should kill Frankie. Si loses a coin toss and smothers Frankie with <b>a</b> <b>cushion.</b> Later, out on the street, Frankie's body is put into an ambulance. Si says to Sally and Graham that he will be in touch and leaves. Sally and Graham discuss selling the camcorder footage, and Jan runs inside to see that Tamsin is not in her chair or room. Upstairs, Tamsin crawls onto the bed containing the balloon, carrying a heart-shaped helium balloon. On the street, Sally, Graham and Jan see Tamsin opening the upstairs window. She releases the helium balloon with the balloon containing Frankie's breath attached. The two float skyward as Graham films.|$|E
5|$|At the {{investiture}} ceremony the Admonitions {{are read}} in turn by the prelate and {{chancellor of the}} order and several insignia are offered on <b>a</b> <b>cushion</b> to the Sovereign by Garter King of Arms, Black Rod, {{and the secretary of}} the order, in turn, so that the Sovereign may perform the ceremony of investiture. Two senior knights of the order assist the Sovereign in these ceremonies by placing the garter around the left leg of the new knight and by assisting the Sovereign in the fastening of the riband and Lesser George about the body of the new knight, and in the adjustment of the mantle and the collar. After the investiture ceremony at Windsor is concluded, a state luncheon is held in the Banqueting Room. This is attended by the royal family, by all the Companions of the Order and their spouses, and by the Officers of the Order. After the banquet all the knights and ladies of the order, together with the prelate, chancellor and other officers of the order, in their mantles and ceremonial robes, led by the Military Knights of Windsor, move in procession, watched by a great crowd of spectators, through the castle, down the hill, which is lined with troops, to Saint George's Chapel for a worship service, before which the formal installation of the new knights takes place.|$|E

5|$|The {{relatively}} modest Coronet of Frederick {{was made in}} 1728 for Frederick, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of GeorgeII. It takes the form laid down in a royal warrant issued by CharlesII which states that the heir apparent of the Crown shall use and bear a coronet of crosses and fleurs-de-lis with one arch surmounted by a ball and cross. The single arch denotes that the Prince of Wales is inferior to the monarch but outranks the other royal children, whose coronets have no arches. Frederick never wore his gold coronet; instead, it was placed on <b>a</b> <b>cushion</b> {{in front of him}} when he took his seat in the House of Lords. It was used by his son, GeorgeIII, then his son, GeorgeIV, and last used by EdwardVII when he was Prince of Wales. Due to its age, a new silver-gilt coronet was made for his son, the future GeorgeV, to wear at Edward's coronation in 1902. In contrast to the earlier coronet, which has a depressed arch, the arch on this one is raised. At George's own coronation in 1911, the coronet was worn by his son, Edward, the next Prince of Wales. After he became king in 1936, EdwardVIII abdicated later the same year and, as the Duke of Windsor, went into exile in France, taking the 1902 coronet with him; it remained abroad until his death in 1972. In its absence, another coronet had to be made for the investiture of Prince Charles in 1969. Unlike the defunct coronets, this one is {{not a part of the}} Crown Jewels but the Honours of the Principality of Wales.|$|E
5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide <b>a</b> <b>cushion</b> (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} seated buttock {{pressure}} distribution in six paraplegic patients {{by means of}} computerized pressure mapping. They were all male and their age ranged from 18 to 48 years old. Their level of paralysis varied from Th 5 to L 1. Five kinds of wheelchair <b>cushions</b> were studied: <b>an</b> air <b>cushion,</b> <b>a</b> contour <b>cushion,</b> <b>a</b> polyurethane foam <b>cushion,</b> <b>a</b> Cubicushion (which is made of polyurethane foams) and <b>a</b> silicone gel <b>cushion.</b> <b>A</b> tactile sensor consisting of 2064 matrices was used for measuring the buttock pressure distribution and the data was analyzed on a personal computer. Peak pressures measured for each cushion were as follows (in descending order) : the Cubicushion, the polyurethane foam cushion, the contour cushion, the silicone gel cushion, and the air cushion. The areas of total contact measured for each cushion were as follows (in descending order) : the air cushion, the silicone gel cushion, the polyurethane foam cushion, the contour cushion and the Cubicushion. Based on these findings, we conclude that the most advantageous cushion is the air cushion or the silicone gel cushion. Likewise, we conclude that the Cubicushion is not practical for pressure sore prevention. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the best adjustable cushions, for the maintenance of normal sitting balance by healthy persons in wheelchairs, from <b>a</b> foam <b>cushion,</b> and <b>a</b> newly-developed air-ad-justable <b>cushion.</b> [Subjects] Eighteen healthy participants (9 men, 9 women) were recruited. [Methods] Participants were evaluated using the Force Sensing Array System to assess average sitting pressure and the symmetry index of chair sitting under the following conditions: no seat <b>cushion,</b> <b>a</b> foam <b>cushion,</b> and <b>a</b> newly-developed air-adjustable <b>cushion.</b> [Results] The results show that there were no significant differences among the average sitting pressures which were measured on the hard surface of a chair, <b>a</b> foam <b>cushion,</b> and the newly-developed cushion. The air-adjustable cushion’s symmetry index turned out to be closer to 0 than those of the foam cushion and the hard surface of the chair. [Conclusion] We suggest that the newly-developed air-adjustable <b>cushion</b> contributes to <b>a</b> more sym-metrical sitting posture than the basic foam cushion or no seat cushion...|$|R
