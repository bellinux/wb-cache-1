5|$|During the 17th century, many architects {{studying}} in Italy learned of Palladio's work. Foreign architects then returned home and adapted Palladio's style to suit various climates, topographies and personal tastes of their clients. Isolated forms of Palladianism {{throughout the world}} were brought <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> way. However, the Palladian style did not reach the zenith of its popularity until the 18th century, primarily in England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland and later North America. In Venice itself there was an early reaction to the excesses of Baroque architecture that manifested itself as a return to Palladian principles. The earliest neo-Palladians there were the exact contemporaries, both trained up as masons, Domenico Rossi (1657–1737) and Andrea Tirali (1657–1737). Tommaso Temanza, their biographer, {{proved to be the}} movement's most able and learned proponent; in his hands the visual inheritance of Palladio's example became increasingly codified in correct rules and drifted towards neoclassicism.|$|E
5|$|It then {{occurred}} to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much more quickly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species, since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year, as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded with those that breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, it {{occurred to}} me to ask the question, why do some die and some live? And the answer was clearly, on the whole the best fitted live... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought <b>about...</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained.|$|E
500|$|The {{problem was}} finding a radar that was {{suitably}} small; CH radar's huge towers obviously {{could not be}} swung <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> fashion. By this time the Army had made considerable progress on adapting the AI electronics {{to build a new}} radar for detecting ships in the English Channel, CD, with an antenna that was small enough to be swung in bearing. In 1938, RAF pilots noted they could avoid detection by CH while flying at low altitudes, so in August 1939, Watt ordered 24-CD sets under the name Chain Home Low (CHL), using them to fill gaps in CH coverage. These systems were initially rotated by pedalling on a bicycle frame driving a gear set. A joke of the era [...] "was that one could always identify one of the W.A.A.F. R.D.F. operators by her bulging calf muscles and unusually slim figure". Motorized controls for CHL were introduced in April 1941.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner", Carl {{evolves into}} a {{desensitized}} character and ultimately relinquishes his naïveté {{to the world}} around him. Although Entertainment Weekly writer Clark Collis drew parallels to a serial killer, Kirkman suggested this was an initiative to give more screen time to the character. He avouched that Carl was [...] "one of the most fun characters to tell stories <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world." [...] He continued: [...] "It's true of the comic and it's true of the show. Over time, we’re {{going to start to}} see more and more of this kid. What's awesome about that is, think about {{what it would be like}} to grow up in this world. It's one thing to have everything you know taken away from you and have to deal with this s—y world you now have to live in. But to have barely even really recognized what the world is and how it works and what to expect and then to be thrust into this apocalyptic threat and to grow up and mature with these kinds of situations. It's going to make him grow up weird, is what I like to say." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{endocrinology}} {{study by}} Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab postulated that [...] "In humans, the main mechanism responsible of [...] sexual identity and orientation involves a direct effect of testosterone on the developing brain." [...] Further, their study puts forward that intrauterine exposure to hormones is largely determinative. Sketching the argument briefly here, the authors say that sexual organs are differentiated first, {{and then the}} brain is sexually differentiated [...] "under the influence, mainly, of sex hormones such as testosterone, estrogen and progesterone on the developing brain cells and under the presence of different genes as well ... The changes brought <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> stage are permanent. ... exual differentiation of the brain is not caused by hormones alone, {{even though they are}} very important for gender identity and sexual orientation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Addressee honorifics {{express the}} social {{status of the}} person being spoken to (the hearer), {{regardless}} {{of what is being}} talked about. For example, Javanese has three different words for [...] "house" [...] depending on the status level of the person spoken to. Referent honorifics express the status of the person being spoken <b>about.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> type of honorific, both the referent (the person being spoken about) and the target (the person whose status is being expressed) of the honorific expression are the same. This is exemplified by the T–V distinction present in many Indo-European languages, in which a different 2nd person pronoun (such as tu or vous in French) is chosen based on the relative social status of the speaker and the hearer (the hearer, in this case, also being the referent). Bystander honorifics express the status of someone who is nearby, but not a participant in the conversation (the overhearer). These are the least common, and are found primarily in avoidance speech such as the [...] "mother-in-law languages" [...] of aboriginal Australia, where one changes one's speech in the presence of an in-law or other tabooed relative.|$|E
2500|$|Bracton {{studied the}} form of the {{original}} writs. He procured, for his own use, complete transcripts of the pleadings in selected cases. These were used to write his treatise on the law. He was also the first to offer commentary on the cases he wrote <b>about.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> way Bracton was modern; he criticised and praised various decisions. He called those who were a generation before him, his [...] "masters". The cases he wrote about were at least twenty years older than his book. His writing is not like a modern legal treatise comparing case results. There is no concept of case law as one would find in a modern text book. He selected cases and wrote a general description of what the law should be in a given set of circumstances. There was no real stare decisis. He gave descriptions of what the decision should be in hypothetical fact situations, without mention of actual cases. He also included many sample writs for various situations. Bracton chose cases based on his admiration for the judges involved, and wanted to make exemplars of their logic. The inclusion of case law was important, {{because it was the first}} time this had occurred in English legal writing. Lawyers for two centuries (thirteenth and fourteenth centuries) were introduced to the concept of case law and legal logic by Bracton's book. A new and modern course was set.|$|E
