Gingrich has argued that the current welfare and unemployment insurance system continues to create work disincentives that trap people in poverty.

50|$|Financial <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>families</b> <b>with</b> {{children}} {{comes in}} the form of child allowances, child care and maintenance allowances, and maternity benefits. Child allowances dated from the 1930s, and they were one of the oldest parts of the welfare system. The law in force in the late 1980s was the Child Allowance Act of 1948, which arranged for payments to parents for all children under the age of sixteen and resident in Finland, regardless of the wealth or nationality of the parents. Child-care allowances had been paid since the 1970s to those parents who stayed at home to care for small children or who had engaged someone else to do so. A child maintenance allowance is paid when a court-ordered maintenance payment for a child of divorced parents was not being paid. A maternity benefit, based on legislation of the 1930s, was paid for each pregnancy. It came either as a grant or as a much more valuable set of materials, the maternity package, needed to tend a child. It was withheld if the mother did not visit a clinic by the fifth month of pregnancy.|$|R

2500|$|Recent debates have {{centered}} {{on the need for}} policies that focus on both [...] "income poverty" [...] and [...] "asset poverty." [...] Advocates for the approach argue that traditional governmental poverty policies focus solely on supplementing the income of the poor through programs such as <b>Aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> <b>Dependent</b> Children (AFDC) and Food Stamps. According to the CFED , 27 percent of households – nearly double the percentage that are income poor – are living in [...] "asset poverty." [...] These families do not have the savings or other assets to cover basic expenses (equivalent to what could be purchased with a poverty level income) for three months if a layoff or other emergency leads to loss of income. Since 2009, the number of asset poor families has increased by 21 percent from about one in five families to one in four families. In order to provide assistance to such asset poor families, Congress appropriated $24 million to administer the Assets for Independence Program {{under the supervision of the}} US Department for Health and Human Services. The program enables community-based nonprofits and government agencies to implement Individual Development Account or IDA programs, which are an asset-based development initiative. Every dollar accumulated in IDA savings is matched by federal and non-federal funds to enable households to add to their assets portfolio by buying their first home, acquiring a post-secondary education, or starting or expanding a small business.|$|E

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{understood}} by welfare researchers that the welfare caseload is quite diverse. Many studies of the now-defunct <b>Aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> Depen-dent Children (AFDC) program demonstrated that some women on the welfare rolls were much worse off than women not on the rolls in terms of family back-ground, educational attainment, labor market experience and skill, health prob-lems, and many other indicators, and that different women might need different types of special assistance. This heterogeneity has assumed even greater impor-tance in the welfare reform environment of the 1990 s. The new reforms are, generally speaking, aimed at raising employment levels and promoting work, particularly off the welfare rolls. It is naturally to be expected that women with greater capabilities to respond to these policies will fare better than women with lesser capabilities. 1 In addition, from the program operator’s viewpoint, hetero-geneity {{is important because it}} implies that policies might be differentially tar-geted, or tailored, to different types of welfare recipients who have different needs and capabilities. The author would like to thank Irwin Garfinkel, Karl Scholz, and {{the other members of the}} Panel for comments, and Eva Sierminska for research assistance. 1 Whether this will turn out to be the case is an empirical matter.

40|$|The 1990 s saw {{considerable}} {{change in}} the Medicaid program. At {{the beginning of the}} decade, Medicaid was still primarily a pro-gram that provided health care coverage to persons receiving cash assistance under the <b>Aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>Families</b> <b>with</b> Disabled Children (AFDC) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs, although expansions of eli gibility for low income pregnant women and children had already begun shifting the focus of coverage away from cash recipients. Health care providers were reimbursed directly for services rendered, and little was offered in the way of care management. While fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursement remains important, {{by the end of the}} decade State Medicaid programs had taken on a new role as purchasers of managed health care and case management services. At the same time, many States relaxed eligibility standards for Medicaid, extending coverage to higher income pregnant women and chil dren or, in some cases, to the general low income uninsured population. In these States, Medicaid reform was a component of a broader effort to increase access to health insurance generally, and to encourage the development of managed care. The States were not the only actors in the Medicaid reform arena.

With the potato famine in Ireland, by 1850, more than 130,000 immigrants from Ireland lived in New York City. Since the newly arrived immigrants were in deep poverty, Tammany Hall provided them with employment, shelter, and even citizenship sometimes. For example, the group gave men looking for work referrals, and legal aide to those who needed it. Tammany Hall would also provide food and financial <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>families</b> <b>with</b> sick or injured breadwinners.
