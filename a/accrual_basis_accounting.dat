5|$|The United States {{government}} uses <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accounting</b> {{for all of}} its funds. Its consolidated annual {{financial report}} uses two indicators to measure financial health: unified budget deficit and net operating (cost)/revenue.|$|E
5|$|The unified budget deficit, a cash-basis measurement, is the {{equivalent}} of a checkbook balance. This indicator does not consider long-term consequences, but has historically been the focus of budget reporting by the media. Except for the unified budget deficit, the federal government's financial statements rely on <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accounting.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{accounting}} basis {{applied to}} fiduciary funds {{depends upon the}} needs of a specific fund. If the trust involves a business-like operation, <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accounting</b> would be appropriate to show the fund's profitability. Accrual basis is also appropriate for trust funds using interest and dividends from invested principle amounts to pay for supported programs, because the profitability of those investments would be important.|$|E
40|$|The {{adoption}} of <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of <b>accounting</b> by governments {{is an important}} element to transform the bureaucratic administrative cash-based system to a more informative financial management system to ensure the supply of comprehensive, reliable, and meaningful financial information for appropriate accountability and decision making. Yemen is engaged in such reform, with advent of the E-Government, Information and Telecommunication Technologies era. This study describes the Yemen Central Government’s accounting and reporting system, its institutional framework, its policy characteristics and the environmental conditions that are in favour and unfavourable of such reform change. It also investigates the relationships between attitudes, innovative and organisational factors, {{as well as the}} {{adoption of}} <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of <b>accounting</b> barriers and its implementation. Additionally, it investigates the moderating effects of E-Government between the abovementioned relationships during the face of change. This is to test if E-Government interaction will influence the strength and direction of the mentioned relationships in the model, and if the predictive power of that model would be increased. Finally, it examines the feasibility of <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of <b>accounting</b> in Yemen. This study applied multiple theories, multi-method approaches (mixed-methods), and utilised qualitative and quantitative methodologies for data (analysis), collected from questionnaires and interview surveys. Twenty hypotheses are tested. The findings show that innovative and organisational factors have a positive relationship with an attitude toward change, while barriers have a negative relationship with an attitude toward change, but E-Government has a positive relationship with an attitude toward change. The results show that institutional frameworks such as the current Yemen governmental accounting and reporting framework, have an acceptable level of moving towards <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of <b>accounting,</b> while accounting system objectives and reporting policy specifications reveal acceptable level of objectives and insufficient level of reporting policy. Even though the Yemen government officially announced the adoption of <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of <b>accounting</b> and performed several alterations on the <b>accounting</b> system toward <b>accrual</b> <b>basis,</b> central government <b>accounting</b> officials are still using (modified) cash <b>basis</b> <b>accounting.</b> Computer integration, across governmental departments, is not complete. Environmental factors that contributed to change from cash <b>basis</b> to <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of <b>accounting</b> are reform stimuli, pressures related to other reforms, and forces of globalisation. The contextual variables are in favour of moving toward <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of <b>accounting.</b> Attitudes toward change were found to have a full mediation effect between innovation factors, organisational factors, barriers, and E-Government, emphasising the important role of accountants, financial managers, and others in the feasible adoption and implementation of <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of <b>accounting.</b> E-Government shows a moderating effect on the relationships between all independent variables and the mediating variable of attitude toward change. This study found Government officials' attitude toward change from cash <b>basis</b> <b>accounting</b> to <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of <b>accounting</b> to be very critical for the adoption and implementation of such change. Government financial officials have to be in line with the change process and their support is crucial for a successful adoption. E-Government (capabilities) is an important element in the success of the adoption and implementation of <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of <b>accounting...</b>|$|R
40|$|M. Com. (International Accounting) This limited-scope {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on a case study performed on a trading entity in a national department in South African government. This limited-scope dissertation contributes to the body of knowledge by examining the effect of the adoption of the <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of <b>accounting</b> on the quality of information available for decision making. There are arguments that the <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of <b>accounting</b> will provide enhanced information for decision making and that it will increase the ability of the users of financial statements to evaluate the financial position and financial performance of entities in the public sector. This limited-scope dissertation assesses the effect of the adoption of the <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of <b>accounting</b> on decision usefulness of information provided in the financial statements of departments in South Africa. This assessment is effected based on the financial statements of a trading entity in a department in South Africa, which has already adopted accrual accounting. To enable an objective assessment of the effect of the adoption of the <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of <b>accounting,</b> two sets of financial statements, in respect of the same entity and the same financial period are compared, one prepared on the modified cash <b>basis</b> of <b>accounting</b> and the other prepared on the <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of <b>accounting</b> [...] ...|$|R

25|$|By {{the timing}} of collection, VAT (as well as {{accounting}} in general) can be either accrual or cash based. Cash basis accounting is a very simple form of accounting. When a payment is received {{for the sale of}} goods or services, a deposit is made, and the revenue is recorded as of the date of the receipt of funds—no matter when the sale had been made. Cheques are written when funds are available to pay bills, and the expense is recorded as of the cheque date—regardless of when the expense had been incurred. The primary focus is on the amount of cash in the bank, and the secondary focus is on making sure all bills are paid. Little effort is made to match revenues to the time period in which they are earned, or to match expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. <b>Accrual</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accounting</b> matches revenues to the time period in which they are earned and matches expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. While it is more complex than cash basis accounting, it provides much more information about your business. The accrual basis allows you to track receivables (amounts due from customers on credit sales) and payables (amounts due to vendors on credit purchases). The accrual basis allows you to match revenues to the expenses incurred in earning them, giving you more meaningful financial reports.|$|E
