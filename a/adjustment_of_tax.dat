40|$|Fiscal {{discipline}} {{is a concern}} in most countries because of a possible spending and deficit bias in present fiscal and political institutions. Recent research has turned to fiscal federalism {{as a source of}} fiscal imbalance and to exploit the variation in fiscal experience. This study allows a comparison of the control regime of decentralized government in Denmark with neighbors Norway and Sweden and with similar analyses of US states. Fiscal adjustments are investigated in the context of responses to shocks. Shocks are measured as deviations from budgeted current surplus, and they motivate an <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> rates and current expenditure to avoid fiscal imbalance. The econometric results show that local governments in Denmark respond to shocks by compensating <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> rates and expenditures. The shock responses tend to be asymmetric, in particular for the income tax. Positive shocks hardly affect the income tax rate, while negative shocks induce higher tax rates. We interpret the asymmetry as the result of spending pressure due to redistributive politics, and show that political characteristics are important for tax determination. We conclude that the Danish design of controlling the local public sector avoids fiscal imbalances, but allows a bias towards expansion. AUTHOR’S NOTE: Ministry of Finance, Denmark, has provided the economic data, and we are grateful for comments at a seminar in the ministry. In particular we appreciate th...|$|E

50|$|Many {{taxes are}} simply called an excise tax {{in the statute}} {{imposing}} that tax (an excise in the statutory law sense) even though they could more accurately be called some other kind <b>of</b> <b>tax.</b> A collection <b>of</b> different <b>taxes</b> has accumulated over the years under the excise tax classification.Often trust funds do not collect enough <b>taxes</b> because <b>of</b> assumptions that the politicians made in setting the excise tax rates and allowable trust fund projects result in underfunding. Changing consumer purchases have made the original assumptions wrong which may also result in underfunding. Because many of the funds are allocated to repay bonds and other long term projects, they often require an infusion of general funds to stay solvent.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically analyse the revenue-expenditure models of public finance by {{considering}} the possibility of non-linear and asymmetric adjustment. A long-run relationship between general government expenditure and revenues is identified for Italy. Following system-wide shocks, the estimated relationship adjusts slowly to equilibrium, mainly due to complex administrative procedures that add to the sluggishness <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> collection and undermine the effective monitoring of public spending. Exogeneity of public expenditure implies that taxes rather than spending, carry the burden <b>of</b> short-run <b>adjustment</b> to correct budgetary disequilibria. Allowing for non-linear adjustment and the possibility of multiple equilibria, our findings show evidence <b>of</b> asymmetric <b>adjustment</b> around a unique equilibrium. In particular, we find that when government expenditure is too high, <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> takes places at a faster rate than when it is too low. Further, there is evidence <b>of</b> a faster <b>adjustment</b> when deviations from the equilibrium level get larger, pointing to a Leviathan-style, revenue-maximiser government...|$|R

Using data {{for up to}} 32 countries from 1983 to 2006, we analyze the role of economic and financial openness as well as tax competition while allowing for dynamic adjustment to shocks and period-specific as well as country-specific effects. While openness {{does not seem to}} be systematically related to corporate tax rates, our findings suggest that countries compete over statutory tax rates. In contrast, we do not find competition over effective marginal rates. While the short-run impact of tax competition on corporate tax rates seems to be modest, the interplay of tax competition and a sluggish <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> rates over time implies that permanent shocks to individual countries have substantial long-run effects on equilibrium tax levels in all countries. corporate taxes, tax competition, openness...|$|E

40|$|Abstract–Since {{the reform}} of tax right division, the problem on land finance {{is more and more}} serious as the economy develops. Land {{transfer}} rent and the relative taxes and fees have already become the main component of local finance revenue. Even though this kind of way will bring the problem of the oversize of the city, government credit crisis, price bubbles in the real estate in the long term run, the land finance still get further development because it can benefit the fiscal revenue and the improvement of the local GDP. Therefore we need to find the effective way to govern the land finance, readjust the tax division system, and distribute the income brought by the land finance. Only in this way can we achieve the sustainable development in both economy and society. Key words–system of tax distribution; land finance; land government; <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> system. In recent years, the local governments devote themselves mainly in the activities on land finance in the process of modernization and urbanization. The land finance revenue takes more and more part in the local finance revenue. According to the statistics, the land finance revenue was 50. 77 billion yuan, 10. 2 %of the local finance revenue in 1998, while the land financ...|$|E

Solutions require transparency, solidarity, equity, social justice {{in the distribution of}} efforts and usufruct (profit) on all chain participants to achieve useful goods and services useful for the human society. An orderly <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> and contribution system may lead to the adoption of those measures to stimulate domestic consumption, domestic output growth and rotation speed of capital, reducing the budget deficit, uncontrolled growth of prices, inflation and unemployment, in a word of imbalances in economic life. To assess the impact of VAT on the chain was started from two hypotheses : rethinking the VAT quota level on the chain and determine and regularization of the VAT, by entitling the right to the users of agricultural production to deduct VAT from the price paid to individual producers (associated) namely calculating VAT from 100 price paid. The results are concretized in: increasing revenues (about 2. 4 billion / year), reducing the public institutions spending on goods and services bearing VAT by 20 % (about 2 oo million Euro/ year), reduction of VAT refunds from the budget, reducing the gap between theoretical and potential VAT collected from 42 % (49. 5 %) to 24 %, by increasing the collection from 58 % (50. 5 %) to 76 %, concentration collecting VAT chargeable (76, 22 %) from merchants and diminishing the amount of payment by the economic operators on channel...|$|E

We then estimate expected utility for generations based on simplifying assumptions and incorporate these expected utility calculations in an overall social welfare measure. Using a horizontal equity index, we also compare the different systems' performance {{in terms of how}} neighboring generations are treated. While the actual Swedish system smoothes stochastic fluctuations more than any other and produces the highest degree of horizontal equity, it does so by accumulating a buffer stock of assets that alleviates the need for frequent <b>adjustments.</b> In terms <b>of</b> social welfare, this accumulation of assets leads to a lower average rate of return that more than offsets the benefits of risk reduction, leaving systems with more frequent adjustments that spread risks broadly among generations as those most preferred. ...|$|R

Existing state rules differ from many current proposals at the federal level.

The advanced warning enables the taxpayers to adjust the tax base to the new circumstances {{so that they can}} adjust their behavior to the existence <b>of</b> the <b>tax.</b> This <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> base by the taxpayer is responsible to the excess burden <b>of</b> the <b>tax.</b> Retroactive taxes, that is taxes imposed on tax bases determined in the past and that, therefore, cannot be changed by the taxpayers are considered as unethical.
