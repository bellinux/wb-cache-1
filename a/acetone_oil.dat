U. Leuven, Naamsestraat 59, 3000 Leuven, Belgium Introduction Asthma {{is one of the most}} prevalent chronic airway diseases, characterized by reversible airway obstruction, airway inflammation, and non-specific airway hyperreactivity. Up to 15 % of all asthma cases in adults are due to chemical exposures at the workplace. Initially, the exposed workers do not show asthmatic symptoms but are getting sensitized. The identification of biomarkers of sensitization could help to move diagnosis to an earlier stage. Using a mouse model of chemical-induced asthma we will explore the process of sensitization towards chemicals at the protein level. Methods On day 1 and 8, mice are treated on both ears with 0, 3 % toluene diisocyanate (TDI), a known respiratory sensitizer, 3 % TDI or a mixture of <b>acetone</b> – olive <b>oil</b> (vehicle-control). On day 15 mice are sacrificed and auricular lymph nodes are collected and prepared for proteome analysis. In a second study, mice are sensitized with 0, 3 % TDI or a mixture of <b>acetone</b> – olive <b>oil</b> on day 1 and 8. On day 15, mice are oropharyngeally challenged with 0, 01 % TDI or <b>acetone</b> – olive <b>oil.</b> One day later, on day 16, lung function measurements are carried out to select responders from non-responders. The auricular lymph nodes of selected mice are subjected to proteome analysis. In both studies two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE) was used to analyze the differential expression of proteins in the auricular lymph nodes of TDI (0, 3 % or 3 %) and vehicle-treated (control) mice. Results In the first study, three conditions were compared in one 2 D-DIGE analysis. In total, 35, 36 and 12 proteins were found differentially expressed between 0, 3 % TDI and control, 3 % TDI and control and 0, 3 % TDI and 3 % TDI respectively. Most proteins were significantly (p< 0, 05) downregulated in TDI treated mice. In the second study, (non-) responding mice were pre-selected based on lung function measurements. 36 proteins were found to be significantly (p < 0, 01) upregulated in 0, 3 % TDI treated mice (clear responders) and 18 proteins were downregulated. 21 proteins could already be identified by peptide mass fingerprinting.

On days 1 and 8, BALB/c mice received dermal applications with toluene- 2, 4 -diisocyanate (TDI) or vehicle (<b>acetone</b> olive <b>oil),</b> followed by two ip injections of cyclophosphamide (CP, days 11 and 13), or one iv injection of antigranulocyte receptor 1 (aGR 1, day 13) monoclonal antibody (mAb), or two ip injections of Ly 6 G-specific mAb (1 A 8, days 13 and 14). On day 15, the mice were challenged (oropharyngeal administration) with TDI or vehicle.

In a third experiment, the lymphocyte subpopulations and the cytokine secretion profile were analyzed after TiO 2 (0. 04 mg/ml) and DNCB (0. 1 %) treatment. Injection of NPs in AOO-treated control mice did not have any effect on lymph node (LN) proliferation. DNCB sensitization resulted in LN proliferation, which was further increased by injection of TiO 2 NPs before DNCB sensitization.

40|$|M. Tech. (Mechanical Engineering) This study {{investigated}} process development of recovering base oils from waste lithium based lubricating grease using a novel combination of thermal degradation {{in an aqueous}} caustic solution and solvent extraction. Lubricating greases consist of a thickening agent dispersed in mineral or synthetic oil, forming a colloidal suspension [1]. Large and increasing volumes of used lubricating oil and grease are produced each year and are considered hazardous wastes. During operation, grease suffers mechanical and thermal degradation [2]. Subsequently, it is regarded as waste {{and it must be}} disposed. The waste oil should be collected and recycled not only to prevent the environmental pollution but also to preserve natural resources. Solvent extraction is the preferred method to recycle waste lubricants as it is cost-effective and requires no further purification of the product [3]. The influence of extraction temperature, agitation strength, extraction time, degrading agent concentration, degrading agent-to-grease and solvent-to-sludge mixing ratios on base oil recovery from waste lubricating grease was investigated. This study further optimised the process by studying the influence of various degrading agents (LiOH, NaOH and KOH) and solvents (n-hexane, toluene, heptane, butane, hexanol and <b>acetone)</b> on <b>oil</b> recovery. Oil recovery was enhanced by increase in both extraction temperature, time and agitation speed. The optimum extraction time was found to be 12 minutes. KOH was found to be the optimum degrading agent compared to LiOH and NaOH. Oil recovery also increased from 8. 04 % to 36. 87 % with increase in KOH m/m from 5 % to 30 %. The recovery also increased with an increase of solvent-to-sludge ratio up to 1 : 6. n-Hexane gave the highest recovery of 74. 39 % while acetone gave the lowest of 7. 43 %. A solvent recovery of 82. 6 % to 88 % was obtained through fractional distillation. The study also investigated the differences between virgin and recycled oil using atomic absorption (AA), inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and Fourier transform infrared radiation (FTIR). Rheological studies of waste grease derived oil (WGDO) were also performed. ICP results showed traces of some elements such as Fe, Cu, Si, Ni and Al at a concentration of less than 0. 9 mg/L. Oxidation was observed to occur at a band length of 1716 cm- 1 while additives were identified at 1670 - 1725 cm- 1. The oil viscosity slightly increased with increasing shear rate at temperatures between 60 °C and 120 °C. The shear rate was varied from 200 to 1000 1 /s, with a viscosity convergence at 100 °C. A financial economic model was applied to investigate the feasibility of the recycling technology. For 800 kg/day treatment plant, an investment of R 6, 031, 304. 27 is required with a potential return on investment of 40 %.

40|$|Globally, house flies (Musca domestica) play an {{important}} role by disturbing livestock and by transmitting disease pathogens. The modern and intensively managed pig farms offer house flies optimal conditions for their survival and reproduction. The floating layer of manure in the current, completely slatted floor system for keeping fattening pigs or sows – together with constantly high temperatures – allows fly reproduction throughout the year regardless of external climatic influence. During recent years there have been reports on an increase of insecticide resistance (IR) in animal husbandry management systems. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the eventual occurrence and the distribution of insecticide resistance in M. domestica on pig farms of the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein. A cross sectional survey assessing occurrence and distribution of IR was conducted on 40 pig farms based on the results of a preliminary questionnaire survey. The susceptibility of M. domestica against the contact insecticide deltamethrin was evaluated by using the FlyBox®-method. Commercial formulations of thiamethoxam, imidacloprid and azamethiphos – all of them feed-through insecticides – were tested under pen side conditions as were the larvicides cyromazine and triflumuron. The results allowed selecting 19 conspicuous fly populations, which were subsequently assessed following their establishment as laboratory strains. Additionally, the topical application was used for an evaluation of pyrethrum, deltamethrin, phoxim, azamethiphos, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid as pure active ingredients. While the exposure for feed-through insecticides lasted for one hour during the on-farm assays, the exposure lasted for 48 hours under laboratory conditions in order to ensure an optimal intake of the active ingredient. The efficacy of both larvicides was also assessed by using other than commercial concentrations. Analysis of the questionnaires revealed that highest fly numbers were observed from July to September. Use of chemical products constituted the mainstay of pest management. Products against adult insects as well as larvicides were routinely used and their efficacy judged as mostly satisfactory by the farmers. On-farm assays showed distinct differences between the feed-through insecticides azamethiphos, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid after an exposure of 1 hour. At the end of an observation period of 24 hours thiamethoxam was found to be the most effective with an average paralysis rate of 91 % contrasting with, respectively, 66 % for azamethiphos and 62 % for imidacloprid. Trials with the pyrethroid deltamethrin by using the FlyBox®-method indicated considerable resistance of the field populations. Following an exposure for 10 seconds, 20 (50 %) of the populations displayed a paralysis inferior to 40 % after 60 minutes. Despite treatment with triflumuron of the larval medium at the commercially recommended dose (5 mg/kg), about 30 % flies were able to emerge from egg deposits. Cyromazine proved to be 100 % effective at the commercially recommended dose of 5 mg/kg. Repetition of the tests with feed-through insecticides under laboratory conditions showed after 3 hours thiamethoxam to achieve the fastest and highest paralysis. The average paralysis rate after 48 hours amounted to 94 %. When exposed to azamethiphos, the highest average paralysis rate was recorded after 4 hours (62 %). Exposure for 48 hours resulted in a paralysis of 96 %. Imidacloprid was found to be the least effective, thereby confirming the results of the on-farm assays. Natural pyrethrum showed little effect when topically applied. Application of the discriminating dose (DD) of 2. 200 ng per fly resulted in an average paralysis of 38 % after 24 hours. However, the same dose resulted in an average paralysis of 86 % when the pyrethroid deltamethrin was used, which contrasted with the results of the on-farm assays when the FlyBox® method had been used. A reduction of the amount of the active ingredient should be considered in future work dealing with an assessment of IR. It is expected that this approach would help to better understand the range of IR. The topical application of the DD of the phosphoric acid phoxim resulted in an average paralysis rate of 28 %. A 16 -fold increase of the DD increased the average paralysis to 93 %. When applying the DD for azamethiphos of 310 ng per fly, 12 (71 %) displayed a medium resistance but three populations proved to be highly resistant. Both thiamethoxam und imidacloprid did not induce notable paralysis when topically applied despite their mixture with <b>acetone</b> and <b>oil</b> as solvent. Thiamethoxam showed an average paralysis of 37 % after 24 hours when the DD of 320 ng per fly was applied. A 16 -fold increase of the DD yielded an average paralysis of only 76 %. Imidacloprid proved even less effective. The 16 -fold DD only produced an average paralysis of 54 %. The larvicidal tests confirmed prior results of the on-farm evaluations: cyromazine used in a dose of 4 mg/kg resulted in 100 % inhibition. The commercially recommended dose amounts to 5 mg/kg. Even a further reduction to 1 mg/kg prevented the emergence by 79 % on average. This contrasted with the findings when triflumuron was used: 4 mg/kg medium merely inhibited the development of 5 out of the 19 tested populations (26 %). It can be concluded that an eventual IR has to be ruled out before the selection of a specific insecticide for the control of adult flies. The use of persistent pyrethroids should be avoided. Preference should be given to natural derives of pyrethrum that are reinforced by synergists like piperonyl butoxide (PBO). A strategic application of chemical products is recommended taking into account seasonal population dynamics, which might assist in avoiding an exacerbation of already existing IR and to prevent new resistance. Further sensible approaches are a rotational scheme of still effective ingredients and a regular mechanical dung removal at weekly intervals. Biological control methods, e. g. releases of insect parasitoids should be considered as another alternative...|$|R
40|$|Student Number : 0009899 J - PhD thesis - School of Therapeutic Sciences - Faculty of Health SciencesThe genus Eriocephalus {{commonly}} known as ‘wild rosemary’, ‘Cape snow bush’, or ‘kapokbos’ {{is a member of}} the family Asteraceae (tribe Anthemideae). The genus is endemic to southern Africa, with the highest concentration of species in the Western and Northern Cape. The genus comprises 32 species and a total of 42 taxa, which are distributed in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Lesotho. The characters used in species delimitation are purely based on morphological variation in floral and foliar parts and are highly homoplastic due to phenotypic plasticity. In many cases these features are not sufficiently distinctive, as some taxa tend to exhibit dimorphism in some character states such as the presence of opposite and alternate leaves. In some species there is extensive intergrading of the major diagnostic characters leading to uncertainty in species delimitation. Both chemical and molecular characters were used in this study in an attempt to evaluate current species delimitations in the genus, along with species-level relationships and affinities. The genus is also economically important with some of its members used as medicinals, fodder, perfumes, and cosmetics. This warrants investigation into the phytochemistry and biological activity of these species in order to determine a scientific rationale for their traditional uses. For this reason, the antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, antioxidant activities, and inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by the volatile oils and leaf extracts of the genus, which are relatively unknown for most members of the genus, were also investigated. Representatives of 22 species of the genus, eight of which were from Namibia and 14 from South Africa were collected from wild populations. In most cases multiple collections per population per species were considered. Aerial plant parts were hydrodistilled to obtain the essential oils, and phenolics were extracted from leaves using <b>acetone.</b> Essential <b>oils</b> were analysed by thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography (GC), gas chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy (GC/MS), and phenolics were analysed using thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC/UV). Biological assays were carried out using the 5 -lipoxygenase enzyme to evaluate antiinflammatory activity; disc diffusion and microtitre plate dilution assays were used to assess antimicrobial activities of selected fungi and bacteria; the TLC-DPPH and DPPHmicrotitre methods were used to investigate antioxidant activities and a TLC-bioautographic assay was used for testing the inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme. Total genomic DNA was extracted from silica dried leaf material. The non-coding plastid DNA regions, the psbA-trnH intergenic spacers and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA were amplified, and sequenced and analysed using the parsimony algorithm. The essential oils are largely comprised of acyclic, monocyclic, and bicyclic regular and irregular mono- and sesquiterpenes of various structural groups. Two hundred compounds were noted in the essential oils with some of the common constituents being; α- and β-pinene, yomogi alcohol, ρ-cymene, 1, 8 -cineole, camphor, 4 -terpineol, spathulenol, caryophyllene oxide, α-copaene and β-caryophyllene. Most of the species have a relatively high content of 1, 8 -cineole and camphor. Twenty-two chemotypes were noted and the potential for commercial development in the flavour, fragrance and pharmaceutical industries has been recorded. Among the favourable chemotypes noted includes the camphor, 1, 8 -cineole, bisabolol oxide B and nerolidol rich oils. However, due to the extensive variability in the essential oil profiles, standardization of oils in commercial development is crucial. The leaf extracts comprised of flavonoids with the flavones and flavanones as the major structural types present in most species. The terpene and flavonoid chemistry of the genus is highly divergent even among multiple individuals of the same species and hence not a good taxonomic marker for specific delimitation as no coherent groups was evident although some phytochemical congruence has been noted between some of the taxa. The DNA sequence data revealed lack of variability in the non-coding regions psbA-trnH and trnL-F among species of the genus. The nuclear DNA region (ITS) was variable but the number of characters separating taxa was too few for resolution of relationships between taxa. Presence of highly divergent paralogous repeats of ITS were also noted in some taxa. The combination of molecular and chemical data did not resolve the species delimitation problems due to the highly variable distribution of characters within a single species. The patterns of variation observed in the genus may be attributed to chemical convergence, divergence, hybridisation, differential gene expression, polymorphism and allelochemical diversification among other factors. The lack of coherence in the phylogenetic and phenetic groupings of the various taxa implies that the current species boundaries may not be a true reflection of natural taxonomic entities. The use of multiple taxa in taxonomic studies is strongly recommended due to the extensive variability noted in the chemical profiles of the taxa that is also depicted in the phylogenetic histories. It also implies that caution should be taken in bioprospecting for new natural products for commercial development, as plant chemical profiles especially from the same species can be very variable. This implies carrying out exhaustive population and genetic studies for evaluation of diversity in the study group. In the antimicrobial assay, the oils were more active against the Gram-positive bacteria (2 - 16 mg/ml) and yeasts (1 - 16 mg/ml). Bacillus cereus and Cryptococcus neofomans were the most susceptible pathogens to the oils. The extracts exhibited low activity against the test pathogens except E. aromaticus and E. pinnatus with activity of 0. 2 mg/ml against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus respectively. The susceptibility of the fungal pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans and the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus to the oils and extracts is an indication of the potential for use of the members of the genus as natural antibiotics. The essential oils exhibited antiinflammatory activities with IC 50 values ranging between 19. 0 - 98. 6 μg/ml. The oils did not show antioxidant activity at the starting concentration of 100 μg/ml but the acetone leaf extracts exhibited antioxidant activities with IC 50 values ranging between 21. 5 - 79. 6 μg/ml. The essential oils showed inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase enzyme. The biological activity of the oils indicates that most of the traditional uses are influenced by the presence of the oils. The in vitro biological activity of the essential oils and extracts against the test pathogens provides a scientific basis for the use of some of the members in traditional herbal remedies and validates the use of some of the members of the genus for treatment of respiratory tract infections, gastro-intestinal disorders, mental conditions, dermal infections, and inflammation. The study records the biological activities for some of the species for the first time and their potential for use in flavourings, perfumery, cosmetics, as sources of antimicrobial drugs, permeability enhancers in pharmaceutical formulations and for use as industrial oils...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of cortical activation in the neonatal brain {{is crucial in}} the study of brain development, as it provides precious information for how the newborn infant processes external or internal stimuli. Thus far functional studies of neonates aimed to assess cortical responses to certain external stimuli are very few, {{due to the lack of}} suitable techniques to monitor brain activity of the newborn. Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) has been found to be suitable for functional studies of the infant brain. By this method haemodynamic changes coupled to cortical activity can be monitored. The overall aim of the research is to assess how the brain is processing sensory stimuli (pleasant and unpleasant) in infants using a non-invasive technique such as NIRS. Studies of smell perception (studies 1 & 2) Olfaction was mainly used as the paradigm in these studies. Smelling is essential for neonatal behavioural adaptation in many mammals, including humans. Methods Study 1 Twenty-three healthy, full-term newborn infants were included in the study at a postnatal age between 6 hours and 192 hours. As odorant sources we used (i) the own mother's colostrum; (ii) vanilla essence; (iii) distilled water as a negative control. The i NIRS optodes were placed over left orbito-frontal gyrus of the frontal lobe. Study 2 Twenty preterm newborn infants in stable condition at testing were studied. As odorant sources a disinfectant solution containing benzalconio chlorate (0. 25 %), ethylic alcohol (66. 29 %), excipients such as lemon <b>oil,</b> <b>acetone,</b> iso-propilic alcohol, camphor and a detergent containing dipropylene glycol methyl ether, water and mineral essences were used. The NIRS optodes were placed bilaterally over left orbitofrontal gyrus of the frontal lobe. Main findings and conclusion Study 1 The main finding of this study was that the NIRS technique can be used in the neonatal period to record activity in the orbito-frontal cortex - as mirrored by changes in blood circulation during exposure to biologically meaningful as well as artificial odors, colostrum and vanilla, respectively. The magnitude of the response in the illuminated region during colostrum exposure was inversely related to postnatal age. Study 2 This study demonstrated that the odors of solutions commonly used in NICUs might elicit a decrease in blood oxygenation in an area likely to include the orbito-frontal olfactory area. These haemodynamic changes are likely to be the result of a dynamic, physiological regulation of regional CBF based upon the olfactory- and trigeminus-related areas of the brain. Study of pain perception (study 3) Supraspinal pain processing of pain in neonates and preemies is still poorly understood. Methods Forty preterm neonates at 28 - 36 weeks of gestation and mean postnatal age of 30. 7 h were studied following standardized tactile (skin disinfection) and painful (venipuncture) stimuli. Changes in regional cerebral haemodynamics were monitored by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) over both somatosensory cortices in 29 newborns, and over the contralateral somatosensory and occipital areas in 11 newborns. Main findings and conclusion Painful and tactile stimuli elicit specific haemodynamic responses in the somatosensory cortex, implying conscious sensory perception in preterm neonates. Somatosensory cortical activation occurs bilaterally following unilateral stimulation and these changes are more pronounced in male neonates and preterm neonates at lower gestational ages. Study of auditory perception (study 4) The aim of the study was to assess differences in activation pattern in response to auditory stimuli before and after the induction of anaesthesia with sevoflurane. Methods The 'Water music", by Handel, was presented to 7 infants aged between 18 and 22 months. NIRS was recorded in different conditions: baseline with no music when the child was asleep, during the music with the child sleeping before anaesthesia, and during the music when the child was in deep anaesthesia. Main Endings and conclusion We observed pronounced bilateral [HbO 2] increase during sleeping, similar to that previously reported in waken subjects and suggesting that the infant perceives the auditory stimulus and likely processes it. When the infant is anaesthetised and many neuronal circuits are not functioning, the auditory stimulus can still be perceived as suggested by the increase of Hb 02 in one hemisphere, but processing might be altered. Overall conclusion These studies and other studies that have been carried out in parallel by other groups demonstrate that NIRS is a suitable technique to assess cortical activation in response to varying forms of sensory stimulation in human infants. The technique is likely to play an important role in providing new insights into the ontogeny of cortical function, as well as possibly providing a sensitive means for the early detection of perinatal cortical impairment...|$|R
