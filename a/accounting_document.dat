50|$|Follow on {{the heels}} of the TIF Sunshine Ordinance is the City Asset Lease Disclosure Ordinance, {{introduced}} by Alderman Flores on May 13, 2009. The ordinance would publish and track documents pertaining to City asset lease agreements worth more than $10 million, such as the leasing of the Chicago Skyway, the Chicago Downtown Public Parking System and the Chicago Parking Meter System. The ordinance would make all documents available online in a searchable format at a single location and provide a single <b>accounting</b> <b>document</b> to track the appropriations, income earner, investments, and future budget distributions generated through the lease of City assets. Currently, information about City lease agreements is available online. However, the information is scattered across several websites in lengthy budget documents. The ordinance would make this information accessible by creating a single <b>accounting</b> <b>document,</b> updated quarterly, on the City of Chicago Department of Finance website to track monies spent and generated in City asset lease agreements.|$|E

[...] Typical topics of the alternative media may include examples of: government entities financing each other's bond issues; Orange County California's or other divisions of government investments in derivatives; financial deals that are kept from the public to entice businesses to locate in a state, which may include tax incentives in exchange for stock assets in a company. Much of both the mainstream and alternative media coverage of the topic of government financial issues must be considered a factor in public's confidence towards issues of government Accountability.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – Since its {{emergence}} in {{the early}} twentieth century, cinema has acquired a cultural identity. As purveyor of light entertainment, the local movie palace sold escapism at a cheap price. It also acted as an important social apparatus that regulated everyday mannerisms and appearance. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the box office ledger of a UK picture house and to consider the role of the <b>accounting</b> <b>document</b> as a medium through which both local and broader social and historical norms can be reflected. Design/methodology/approach – The paper primarily employs archival sources. It examines the box office ledger of the Edinburgh Playhouse cinema for the period 1929 - 1973. This ledger is held within the National Archive of Scotland. Secondary sources are also drawn upon to provide a social and historical context to the study. Findings – The analysis of the box office ledger illustrates the potential value of an <b>accounting</b> <b>document</b> as a source of social history. Not only does this single ledger mirror the defining moments in British cinema history, it also helps inform the conception of what constitutes accounting, shapes the perception of contemporary strategic management accounting rhetoric, and further an appreciation of the relationship between accounting and everyday life. Originality/value – The entertainment industry has been largely ignored within accounting scholarship. Such neglect is lamentable given both the scale of the industry and its impact on contemporary culture. This paper is an attempt to redress this neglect by examining one component of the entertainment business, cinema, through the medium of an <b>accounting</b> <b>document.</b> Accounting, Accounting history, Cinema, Management accounting, United Kingdom...|$|E
