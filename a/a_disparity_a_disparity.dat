40|$|In Japan, <b>disparities</b> in {{high schools}} showed <b>an</b> {{increasing}} tendency {{until the end of}} the 1970 s. Since that time, attempts have been made to analyze and reduce these disparities, both in the field of sociology of education and educational reforms. This paper aims to re-examine the challenges in both fields and to elucidate their positive outcomes and limitations, and in addition, to point out a new perspective for future challenges in this area. Academically, the study of disparities began with the application of the concept of "tracking. " At the beginning, many types of evils caused by disparities were problematized, and the concept of "tracking" was adopted to document the situation. The concept of "tracking" was compatible with functionalism, which was the main theoretical stream in the sociology of education at that time. The concept of "tracking" was originally used in studies of high schools in the United States to reveal the fact that there were invisible mechanisms for the selection of students in open curriculum systems. However, in Japan, the concept was used to report the fact that there were great differences in the inner processes of schools and subjective aspects of students based on school disparities. In other words, the concept was used to point out the effects of the <b>disparities.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, the study of <b>disparities</b> has been developed as the study of "tracking effects. " It can be said that studies of the tracking effect could have contributed to investigations of the inner processes of schools and subjective aspects of students. But instead, they took a macro perspective from the studies of school <b>disparities.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, <b>disparities</b> were not examined in relation to social structures. Politically, there are two ways to reduce disparities in schools. One is to control the level of achievement of new students in order to prevent the emergence of differences among schools (input control). The other is to control educational activities in the schools to ensure that tracking effects do not take place in each school (through-put control). Since the late 1970 s, input controls have been carried out through reforms of the entrance examination system of high schools and improvements of the guidance system of junior high schools. However, these controls were too indirect to reduce school disparities. In other words, whether they could reduce the disparities or not depended on their ability to change students 2 ̆ 7 standards for school choice, which were indeed subjective. Through-put controls have been carried out as reforms of high schools. High school reforms after the 1980 s were generally seen as an attempt to weaken classifications and frames of education. Logically, it seemed that these efforts led to a limitation of tracking effects in each school and to <b>a</b> reduction in school <b>disparities</b> as <b>a</b> whole. However, these attempts were not effective as they lacked a grand design and were done separately for each school. Challenges to the school disparities in both fields mentioned above seems to be homologous. They share the fact that they look at the <b>disparities</b> from <b>a</b> narrow perspective, only in relation to inner processes of each school or the subjective aspect of students. School disparities are social disparities. For example, they involve class differences among the enrolled students, and are related to regional differences. Consequently, in order to reduce school disparities, it is necessary to see them in their social context. The conclusion of this paper, by introducing recent challenges to school disparities, proposes this new perspective...|$|R

40|$|AbstractStereoacuity {{thresholds}} {{have been}} shown to depend on the <b>disparity</b> of <b>a</b> point with respect to a slanted reference plane through neighbouring points [Curr. Biol. 12 (2002) 825]. Here we explored a wider range of conditions, including slanting the reference points about a horizontal axis and varying the spacing of the reference dots, allowing alternative hypotheses for the effect to be distinguished. The stimulus consisted of three dots; the outer two defined a line that was slanted in depth. Observers judged in which of two intervals the third, central dot was displaced from the location midway between the outer reference dots. The displacement consisted of both <b>a</b> <b>disparity</b> and <b>a</b> shift in the fronto-parallel plane. We compared performance for pairs of conditions in which the disparity was the same but the fronto-parallel shifts were in opposite directions. Models based purely on relative disparity predict that performance should be the same for these conditions. We found consistent differences: performance was always better when the target had <b>a</b> greater <b>disparity</b> with respect to the line joining the reference dots. The other stimulus parameters varied were: target disparity (concave/convex), stimulus size (large/small), slant sign (sky/ground) and axis (vertical/horizontal).

40|$|Abstract:- The {{generation}} of <b>a</b> <b>disparity</b> map usually requires <b>a</b> pair of precisely rectified stereo images, which {{implies that the}} images have epipolar geometry. In many practical cases, {{it is not easy}} to obtain a rectified stereo pair without using specialized stereo camera systems. We have proposed a new approach for generating <b>a</b> <b>disparity</b> map from <b>a</b> random stereo pair, called a segment- based piecewise linear transformation. The basic concept relies on the fact that displacements from piecewise image to image registration approximate to the disparity. Using this approach, segmentation of the left image is carried out first, followed by extraction of conjugate points from the stereo pair. Finally, a set of linear transformation functions is determined using least squares method. By applying these functions, the displacement for each pixel is calculated to allow for the {{generation of}} <b>a</b> <b>disparity</b> map. To estimate the quality of the resulting disparity map, two stereo anaglyphs, one from the disparity map and the other from the original stereo pair, were produced and compared visually. The results show that the disparity map works well on both uniform and slanted disparity surfaces. An advantage of this approach is that it does not necessarily require stereo rectification, and that it is applicable to any set of stereo images that are not in epipolar geometry...|$|R
