2500|$|Camels {{are able}} to {{withstand}} changes in body temperature and water consumption that would kill most other animals. Their temperature ranges from [...] at dawn and steadily increases to [...] by sunset, before they cool off at night again. In general, to compare between camels and the other livestock, camels lose only 1.3 liters of fluid intake every day while the other livestock lose 20 to 40 liters per day (Breulmann, et al., 2007) Maintaining the brain temperature within certain limits is critical for animals; to assist this, camels have a rete mirabile, a complex of arteries and veins lying very {{close to each other}} which utilizes countercurrent blood flow to cool blood flowing to the brain. Camels rarely sweat, even when ambient temperatures reach [...] Any sweat that does occur evaporates at the skin level rather than at the surface of their coat; the heat of vaporization therefore comes from body heat rather than <b>ambient</b> <b>heat.</b> Camels can withstand losing 25% of their body weight to sweating, whereas most other mammals can withstand only about 12–14% dehydration before cardiac failure results from circulatory disturbance.|$|E
2500|$|Predators are {{physically}} distinguished from humans by their greater height, arthropod-like mandibles and long, hair-like appendages {{on their heads}} that are set into their skulls (popularly perceived as [...] "dreadlocks"). Their bodies are resilient to damage, capable of recovering from multiple gunshot wounds and radiation doses which would be fatal to humans. Their wounds do however require medical attention and they incorporate a portable surgical kit in their armor for this purpose. They are also capable of enduring excruciating pain. Predators are much stronger than humans, having been portrayed as being easily capable of outmatching a conditioned adult human male and shattering solid concrete with their bare hands. They are also skilled climbers, and will readily move through trees or across rooftops in pursuit of prey. Though capable of surviving exposure in Antarctic temperatures {{for an extended period}} of time, it is implied that Predators have a preference for hot equatorial climates, and thus making them ectotherms. Their blood is luminescent phosphor green in color. Their vision operates mainly in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum; they can easily detect heat differentials in their surroundings but are unable to easily distinguish among objects of the same relative temperature. A Predator's bio-mask increases its ability to see in a variety of spectra, ranging from the low infrared to the high ultraviolet, and also filters the <b>ambient</b> <b>heat</b> from the area, allowing them to see things with greater clarity and detail. While they are capable of breathing Earth's atmosphere, the creature in Predator 2 is seen using a breathing mask after losing his helmet (Although it should be noted that this Predator had just been shot multiple times and may have therefore not been operating at his full potential). Their dietary habits are also mentioned in Predator 2, where it is revealed that the creature regularly visits a slaughterhouse every two days to feed on the stored meat there.|$|E

5000|$|An average-sized {{wash load}} will convert {{approximately}} 4965 kilojoules of <b>ambient</b> <b>heat</b> into latent heat that {{is stored in}} the evaporated water, as follows. A typical 4 kg load of laundry can contain 2.2 kg of water, after being spun in a laundry machine. To determine how much heat has been converted in drying a load of laundry, weigh the clothes when they are wet and then again after the clothes have dried. The difference is {{the weight of the}} water that was evaporated from them. Multiply that weight in kg by 2,257 kJ/kg, which is the heat of vaporization per kilogram, to obtain the number of kilojoules that went into evaporating the water, or multiply by 0.6250 kWh/kg to get kilowatt-hours. (Note: If the moisture later condenses inside the house, the latent heat will be converted back into <b>ambient</b> <b>heat</b> which could increase the temperature of the air in the room slightly.)

5000|$|Optical discs can {{be damaged}} by {{exposure}} to extreme temperatures; direct sunlight may overheat the disc or damage the data layer with UV rays. Exposure to heat and light have different effects on discs with data and metal layers of different composition. In all optical discs high temperatures can cause the substrate to soften and the disc to warp. <b>Ambient</b> <b>heat,</b> heat build-up, and light do little to damage the data layer of a ROM disc as it is made of aluminium; the only known problem occurring with the prolonged exposure of ROM discs to light is [...] "clouding" [...] or [...] "coloring" [...] of the polycarbonate substrate. CD-R, DVD-R, DVD+R, CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW and DVD-RAM discs are all affected {{by exposure to}} <b>ambient</b> <b>heat</b> as well as heat build-up due to direct sunlight. A CD-R’s data layer is made of dye that degrades at high temperatures, becoming less transparent so that pits and lands are read incorrectly, making the data unreadable. UV rays in sunlight are energetic enough to produce a photochemical reaction that changes the optical properties of the dye. RW and RAM discs' data layers are composed of a phase-changing film that is even more sensitive to heat than the dye found in R discs, so that they degrade even faster when subjected to <b>ambient</b> <b>heat</b> or direct sunlight. The phase-changing film in RW and RAM discs is not light-sensitive, and UV rays do not affect the optical properties of the film. After being exposed to freezing temperatures a disc’s separate layers may warm at different speeds, causing separation of the layers. If heated or cooled significantly a disc {{should be allowed to}} return to room temperature before use.|$|E

Al 203 pins were slid against PS 300 coated superalloy disks in air, under a 4. 9 N load at velocities of 1 to 8 m/s.

40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} model studies of stimulated L&# 8594;H transitions. These studies use a novel reduced {{mesoscale}} model. Studies reveal that L&# 8594;H transitions can {{be triggered by}} particle injection into a subcritical state (i. e., P<PThresh). Particle injection alters the edge mean flow shear via changes of density and temperature gradients. The change of edge mean flow shear is critical to turbulence collapse and the subsequent stimulated transition. For low <b>ambient</b> <b>heating,</b> strong injection is predicted to trigger a transient turbulence collapse. We predict that repetitive injection can maintain the turbulence collapse and so sustain a driven H-mode-like state. The total number of particles required to induce a transition by either injection or gas puffing is estimated. Results indicate that {{the total number of}} injected particles required is much smaller than that required for inducing a transition by gas puffing.
