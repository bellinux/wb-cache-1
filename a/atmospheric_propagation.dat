40|$|An {{extended}} Fourier pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) {{method is}} presented to model <b>atmospheric</b> sound <b>propagation</b> by solving the linearized Euler equations. In this method, evaluation of spatial derivatives {{is based on an}} eigenfunction expansion. Evaluation on a spatial grid requires only two spatial points per wavelength. Time iteration is done using a low-storage optimized six-stage Runge-Kutta method. This method is applied to two-dimensional non-moving media models, one with screens and one for an urban canyon, with generally high accuracy in both amplitude and phase. For a moving atmosphere, accurate results have been obtained in models with both a uniform and a logarithmic wind velocity profile over a rigid ground surface and {{in the presence of a}} screen. The method has also been validated for three-dimensional sound propagation over a screen. For that application, the developed method is in the order of 100 times faster than the second-order-accurate FDTD solution to the linearized Euler equations. The method is found to be well suited for <b>atmospheric</b> sound <b>propagation</b> simulations where effects of complex meteorology and straight rigid boundary surfaces are to be investigated.

40|$|Laser {{systems are}} finding {{a home in}} many {{military}} applications- such as Space Situational Awareness, imaging and weapons systems. With an increasing focus on programs that entail <b>atmospheric</b> <b>propagations,</b> {{there is a need}} for a cost effective method of performing laboratory proof-of-concept demonstrations. The use of one SLM (single phase screen) to model atmospheric effects has been investigated previously with promising results. However, some effects cannot be captured with a single SLM. This paper focuses on the addition of a second SLM and quantifying the results. Multiple screens will allow the user to independently control the Fried parameter, the isoplanatic angle, and Rytov Variance. The research is comprised of simulation and experiment. The simulation demonstrates the ability to accurately model atmospheric effects with two phase screens. Based on the simulation, a hardware implementation was tested in the lab. The results of this research show promise, however some issues remain. This thesis describes the experimental set-up and results based on measurement of phase and intensity of the propagated field.

40|$|The first {{objective}} was to evaluate the postlaunch radiometric calibration of the LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM) band 6 data. The second {{objective was}} to determine to what extent surface temperatures could be computed from the TM and 6 data using <b>atmospheric</b> <b>propagation</b> models. To accomplish this, ground truth data were compared to a single TM- 4 band 6 data set. This comparison indicated satisfactory agreement over a narrow temperature range. The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>propagation</b> model (modified LOWTRAN 5 A) was used to predict surface temperature values based on the radiance at the spacecraft. The aircraft data were calibrated using a multi-altitude profile calibration technique which had been extensively tested in previous studies. This aircraft calibration permitted measurement of surface temperatures based on the radiance reaching the aircraft. When these temperature values are evaluated, an error in the satellite's ability to predict surface temperatures can be estimated. This study indicated that by carefully accounting for various sensor calibration and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>propagation</b> effects, and expected error (1 standard deviation) in surface temperature would be 0. 9 K.
