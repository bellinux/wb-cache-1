2500|$|Bedford Purlieus was {{declared}} a national nature reserve (NNR) in 2000. Most of England's 224 NNRs are managed by Natural England, but 88 are wholly or partly managed by other <b>approved</b> <b>bodies.</b> Bedford Purlieus is {{managed by the}} Forestry Commission, and {{is open to the}} public during daylight hours. It is notable for having a wider variety of herbaceous woodland plants than almost any other English woodland. The [...] of ancient woodland {{was declared}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1969, and it is a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I. The abundance and variety of the woodland flora and fauna is outstanding. The range of woodland flowers are especially notable. There were 462 species of vascular plants listed as present in the woods in 1975, and the whole range of flora associated with ancient woodland is exceptionally rich. A principal reason for this is the variety of soil types, resulting from a geology that ranges from highly calcareous limestone and tufa through to highly acidic sands and silts. The variety of coppice woodland types, the management history, the wide grassland rides, and even the periodic disturbances caused by coppicing, felling and other interventions such as the wartime installations have all added habitats that maintain the diversity of species within the woods.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{looks at}} the {{mismatch}} between how ratings authorities and other 2 ̆ 7 juridical 2 ̆ 7 bodies have authority to fix {{the meaning of a}} text in a manner that often opposes the understandings that circulate among a text 2 ̆ 7 s intended community of use. I look at a specific case - the banning in New Zealand of the popular anime Puni Puni Poemy due to the perception that it was liable to promote child abuse. I look at how the perception that manga, anime and other genres of Japanese popular culture are rated negatively by these juridical bodies as well as the press and note how resistant these readings are to being challenged by fans or indeed by academic experts. I conclude that the resistance to accepting fan readings can be explained in terms of Foucault 2 ̆ 7 s notion of governmentality - in particular the manner in which audiences are not conceived of as individual, discerning viewers, but as unruly subjects in need of regulation and guidance by <b>approved</b> <b>bodies...</b>|$|E

30|$|Expert recommendations: {{introduction}} and {{description of the}} methodology: The present recommendations, which build on the risk management compendium in cardiology {{and contribute to the}} quality improvement program implemented by our <b>approved</b> <b>bodies,</b> are the product of work carried out by a group of experts convened by the Société de Réanimation de Langue Française (SRLF; French Intensive Care Society) and the Groupe Francophone de Réanimation et Urgences Pédiatriques (GFRUP; French Group for Pediatric Intensive Care and Emergencies). Four pediatric experts provided clinical justifications {{for each of the four}} fields of application defined by the organization committee. Because the fields of application differ greatly in adults, we chose to formulate recommendations for pediatric patients. For the most part, our recommendations arise from prospective and retrospective observational studies and international consensus. All proposed recommendations were reviewed and discussed individually, each expert being asked to justify the substance and format of his/her proposals, and potentially amend them to take into account comments from peers. Proposals were then rated by the four designated experts and seven associate pediatric experts, all qualified in the specific field. The aim of this review process was not necessarily to reach a single, convergent opinion for each proposal, but to delineate clearly areas of agreement on which the recommendations are based as well as points of contention or indecision that require further investigation. Each expert rated each recommendation using the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method with three rating rounds after eliminating outliers (experts with deviating opinions). Each proposal was rated using a numerical scale ranging from 1 to 9 (1 being “disagree entirely,” “total lack of evidence,” or “strictly contraindicated” and 9 being “agree entirely,” “formal evidence,” or “formally indicated”). Three rating zones were then defined depending on the value of the median: the “disagreement” zone (1 – 3); the “indecision” zone (4 – 6); and the “agreement” zone (7 – 9). The agreement, disagreement, or indecision was said to be “strong” if the median interval was included within one of the three zones (1 – 3), (4 – 6), or (7 – 9). The agreement, disagreement, or indecision was said to be “weak” if the median interval impinged on the boundary of another zone (e.g., [1 – 4] or [6 – 8]). The methodology used to formulate these recommendations was based on the GRADE system ([URL] The originality of the GRADE approach is notably due to the following aspects: A level of evidence is not assigned to a study solely on the basis of study type (e.g., randomized trial or not); the risk–benefit ratio is taken into account fully; finally, when formulating recommendations, the phrases “should be/should not be (it is/is not advisable to)” and “it is probably advisable to/not to” have clearly distinct meanings for users.|$|E
