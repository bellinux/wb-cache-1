5|$|Early {{research}} on the galactic habitable zone, including the 2001 paper by Gonzalez, Brownlee, and Ward, did not demarcate any specific boundaries, merely stating that the zone was <b>an</b> <b>annulus</b> encompassing a region of the galaxy that was both enriched with metals and spared from excessive radiation, and that habitability {{would be more likely}} in the galaxy's thin disk. However, later research conducted in 2004 by Lineweaver and colleagues did create boundaries for this annulus, {{in the case of the}} Milky Way ranging from 4 kpc to 10 kpc from the galactic center.|$|E
5|$|The genus {{once served}} as a {{wastebasket}} taxon for many agaric mushrooms with a white spore print, gills attached to the stem, and <b>an</b> <b>annulus.</b> Due largely to differing interpretations on {{the limits of the}} genus, over 270 species and varieties have been placed in Armillaria or its synonym Armillariella. A comprehensive 1995 study by Tom Volk and Harold Burdsall evaluated all of the epithets that have been used in Armillaria or Armillariella. They determined that about 40 species belong to Armillaria sensu stricto (in the strict sense); the remaining names belong to species that are distributed among 43 other modern fungal genera.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent studies {{saw more}} {{fundamental}} {{revision of the}} old concept of the galactic habitable zone as <b>an</b> <b>annulus.</b> In 2008, a study by Nikos Prantzos revealed that, while {{the probability of a}} planet escaping sterilization by supernova was highest at a distance of about 10 kpc from the galactic center, the sheer density of stars in the inner galaxy meant that the highest number of habitable planets could be found there. The research was corroborated in a 2011 paper by Michael Gowanlock, who calculated the frequency of supernova-surviving planets as a function of their distance from the galactic center, their height above the galactic plane, and their age, ultimately discovering that about 0.3% of stars in the galaxy could today support complex life, or 1.2% if one does not consider the tidal locking of red dwarf planets as precluding the development of complex life.|$|E

50|$|On wells {{with gas}} lift capability, many {{operators}} consider it prudent {{to install a}} valve, which will isolate the <b>A</b> <b>annulus</b> {{for the same reasons}} a DHSV may be needed to isolate the production tubing in order to prevent the inventory of natural gas downhole from becoming a hazard as it became on Piper Alpha.|$|R
5|$|The {{usefulness}} of inversion {{can be increased}} significantly by resizing. As noted in Viète's reconstruction, the three given circles and the solution circle can be resized in tandem while preserving their tangencies. Thus, the initial Apollonius problem is transformed into another problem that may be easier to solve. For example, the four circles can be resized so that one given circle is shrunk to a point; alternatively, two given circles can often be resized {{so that they are}} tangent to one another. Thirdly, given circles that intersect can be resized so that they become non-intersecting, after which the method for inverting to <b>an</b> <b>annulus</b> can be applied. In all such cases, the solution of the original Apollonius problem is obtained from the solution of the transformed problem by undoing the resizing and inversion.|$|E

30|$|The {{physical}} domain {{can be a}} concentric or eccentric annulus. The annulus {{between the}} drill pipe and the borehole or casing has been represented as <b>a</b> concentric <b>annulus</b> (Chen et al. 2007) and as <b>an</b> eccentric <b>annulus</b> (Duan et al. 2010) with eccentricity (e = E/(Ro − Ri)) of 0.78, where E is offset distance between the centers of the inner tube, Ri, and the outer tube, Ro, of annulus.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 28-38 mm. The forewings {{are dark}} purplish red with <b>a</b> small <b>annulus</b> {{in the base}} of the cell, a larger one at the middle and <b>a</b> discocellular <b>annulus</b> with black margins and purple-red centres.

25|$|As {{the range}} of {{permissible}} transformations becomes broader, {{the range of}} objects one is able to distinguish as preserved by {{the application of the}} transformations becomes narrower. Similarity transformations are fairly narrow (they preserve the relative distance between points) and thus allow us to distinguish relatively many things (e.g., equilateral triangles from non-equilateral triangles). Continuous transformations (which can intuitively be thought of as transformations which allow non-uniform stretching, compression, bending, and twisting, but no ripping or glueing) allow us to distinguish a polygon from <b>an</b> <b>annulus</b> (ring with a hole in the centre), but do not allow us to distinguish two polygons from each other.|$|E
25|$|This is {{selected}} where the liner {{is required to}} mechanically hold back the movement of formation sand. There are many variants of openhole sand control, the three popular choices being stand-alone screens, openhole gravel packs (also known as external gravel packs, where a sized sand 'gravel' is placed as <b>an</b> <b>annulus</b> around the sand control screen) and expandable screens. Screen designs are mainly wire-wrap or premium; wire-wrap screens use spiral-welded corrosion-resistant wire wrapped around a drilled basepipe to provide a consistent small helical gap (such as , termed 12 gauge). Premium screens use a woven metal cloth wrapped around a basepipe. Expandable screens are run to depth before being mechanically swaged to a larger diameter. Ideally, expandable screens will be swaged until they contact the wellbore wall.|$|E
25|$|It is {{considered}} to be an outstanding edible species with a distinctively sweet or nutty flavor. However, great caution must be exercised to properly identify it, as the deadly Amanita ocreata (and occasionally Amanita phalloides) is also found in the same habitat at the same time of year, and can often be found in close proximity to each other. A. ocreata and A. phalloides have thin universal veil remnants, a sac-like volva, <b>an</b> <b>annulus,</b> a non-striate pileus margin, and a pileus that is a different color than A. velosa. These differences can fade as the fruiting body ages, making it important to collect only specimens that have all of their identifying characteristics intact. Some authorities {{go so far as to}} say no Amanita should be considered for eating.|$|E

25|$|One {{description}} {{of the types of}} simple-closed curves that may appear {{on the surface of the}} Klein bottle is given by the use of the first homology group of the Klein bottle calculated with integer coefficients. This group is isomorphic to Z×Z2. Up to reversal of orientation, the only homology classes which contain simple-closed curves are as follows: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (0,1). Up to reversal of the orientation of a simple closed curve, if it lies within one of the two crosscaps that make up the Klein bottle, then it is in homology class (1,0) or (1,1); if it cuts the Klein bottle into two Möbius strips, then it is in homology class (2,0); if it cuts the Klein bottle into <b>an</b> <b>annulus,</b> then it is in homology class (0,1); and if bounds a disk, then it is in homology class (0,0).|$|E
25|$|The two given circles α and β cannot intersect; hence, {{the smaller}} given circle must lie {{inside or outside}} the larger. The circles are usually shown as <b>an</b> <b>annulus,</b> i.e., with the smaller given circle inside the larger one. In this configuration, the Steiner-chain circles are {{externally}} tangent to the inner given circle and internally tangent to the outer circle. However, the smaller circle may also lie completely outside the larger one (Figure 2). The black circles of Figure 2 satisfy the conditions for a closed Steiner chain: they are all tangent to the two given circles and each is tangent to its neighbors in the chain. In this configuration, the Steiner-chain circles have {{the same type of}} tangency to both given circles, either externally or internally tangent to both. If the two given circles are tangent at a point, the Steiner chain becomes an infinite Pappus chain, which is often discussed {{in the context of the}} arbelos (shoemaker's knife), a geometric figure made from three circles. There is no general name for a sequence of circles tangent to two given circles that intersect at two points.|$|E
25|$|Sciatica is {{generally}} {{caused by the}} compression of lumbar nerves L4, or L5 or sacral nerves S1, S2, or S3, or by compression of the sciatic nerve itself. When sciatica is caused by compression of a dorsal nerve root (radix), it is considered a lumbar radiculopathy (or radiculitis when accompanied with an inflammatory response). This can occur {{as a result of}} a spinal disk bulge or spinal disc herniation (a herniated intervertebral disc), or from roughening, enlarging, or misalignment (spondylolisthesis) of the vertebrae, or as a result of degenerated discs that can reduce the diameter of the lateral foramen (natural hole) through which nerve roots exit the spine. The intervertebral discs consist of <b>an</b> <b>annulus</b> fibrosus, which forms a ring surrounding the inner nucleus pulposus. When there is a tear in the anulus fibrosus, the nucleus pulposus (pulp) may extrude through the tear and press against spinal nerves within the spinal cord, cauda equina, or exiting nerve roots, causing inflammation, numbness, or excruciating pain. Inflammation of the spinal canal can also spread to adjacent facet joints and cause lower back pain and/or referred pain in the posterior thigh(s). Pseudosciatic pain can also be caused by compression of peripheral sections of the nerve, usually from soft tissue tension in the piriformis or related muscles.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the early {{results of a}} new method to repair malfunctioning bicuspid aortic valves by creating a tricuspid valve with a crown-like (i. e. anatomic) annulus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve patients (ages from 10 to 27 years) with chronic regurgitation (and flow-dependent stenosis) of a bicuspid aortic valve underwent repair with the principle of creating a tricuspid valve and <b>a</b> crown-like <b>annulus.</b> The fused leaflets were trimmed and reinserted underneath the existing aortic annulus to create one new native cusp. The third leaflet was fashioned out of a xenopericard patch and was inserted underneath the existing annulus as well to restore the crown-like anatomy of <b>a</b> normal aortic <b>annulus.</b> <b>A</b> tricuspid aortic valve with <b>a</b> morphologically normal <b>annulus</b> was thus created, which resulted in improved coaptation of the leaflets.

25|$|As {{the overall}} or {{external}} {{size of a}} roundabout (in the UK {{referred to as the}} Inscribed Circle Diameter – ICD) is reduced, so the maximum practicable (and prescribed) diameter for the central island is also reduced, whilst the width of the circulatory carriageway increases (due to the greater width of vehicle swept path at smaller turning radii). In most cases this results in it being too easy – certainly when traffic is light relative to capacity – for drivers to traverse the roundabout at relatively high speed, with scant regard for road markings or the potential dangers to self or conflicts with other road users. To mitigate this risk, a proportion of the circulatory carriageway – <b>an</b> <b>annulus</b> around the central island – is segregated from general use by demarcation lines and differentiated from the outer annulus of carriageway by a combination of slightly raised surface, adverse crossfall, contrasting colours and textures and demarcating lines. The effect of this is to discourage drivers from taking a more direct path through the roundabout, their line of least resistance being more tightly curved (and therefore slower) but more bearable. The inner annulus provides for the trailing axles of longer or articulated vehicles to sweep across the inner annulus, which is therefore known as an over-run area (in UK usage), truck apron, or mountable apron.|$|E
500|$|Leucoagaricus leucothites {{is another}} all-white {{mushroom}} with <b>an</b> <b>annulus,</b> free gills, and white spore print, but it lacks a volva and has thick-walled dextrinoid (staining red-brown in Melzer's reagent) egg-shaped spores with a pore.

Like many white amanitas, young fruit bodies of A.bisporigera, still enveloped in the universal veil, can be confused with puffball species, but a longitudinal cut of the fruit body reveals internal structures in the Amanita that are absent in puffballs. In 2006, seven members of the Hmong community living in Minnesota were poisoned with A.bisporigera because they had confused it with edible paddy straw mushrooms (Volvariella volvacea) that grow in Southeast Asia.|$|E

500|$|In {{astrobiology}} {{and planetary}} astrophysics, the galactic habitable zone is {{the region of}} a galaxy in which life might most likely develop. More specifically, {{the concept of a}} galactic habitable zone incorporates various factors, such as metallicity and the rate of major catastrophes such as supernovae, in order to calculate which regions of the galaxy are more likely to form terrestrial planets, initially develop simple life, and provide a suitable environment for this life to evolve and advance. According to research published in August 2015, very large galaxies may [...] favor the birth and development of habitable planets more than smaller galaxies such as the Milky Way.

40|$|We {{provide a}} more {{informal}} explanation of two results in our manuscript Tilings of quadriculated annuli.
