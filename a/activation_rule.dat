The system is trained on a normal data set, with no prior information about the scene under surveillance, thereby requiring minimal user input. Nodes use a trace <b>activation</b> <b>rule</b> and feedforward connections, modified so that higher layer nodes are sensitive to trajectory segments traced across the previous layer. Top layer nodes have binary lateral connections and corresponding “novelty accumulator ” nodes. Lateral connections are set between co-occurring nodes, generating a signal to prevent accumulation of the novelty measure along normal sequences. In abnormal sequences the novelty accumulator nodes are allowed to increase their activity, generating an alarm state. ...|$|E

To do so, we adapt the IC model that is known to simulate the diffusion of information through a network as described above. Information diffusion and attraction processes have some commonalities but differ in various aspects. In traditional information diffusion models such as the IC model, the network is usually considered as stable {{in the sense that}} the set of nodes and the set of edges do not change over time. However, the nodes changes their states [...] "inactive” and [...] "active” during the information diffusion process. Attraction, as it is studied in this paper, is similar in the sense that actors who are not part of the community (i.e. do not have contributed a tweet) are inactive while others are considered as active. On the other hand, the original IC model does not account for the fact that the network grows when new actors become attracted to the community. Thus, the IC model was adapted to take into account the creation times of the edges. These time-varying networks have special characteristics regarding reachability of node pairs since a walk on the graph can only take edges with increasing timestamp, which is known as the time-respecting property (see [27, 28]). In this aspect, we added a new <b>activation</b> <b>rule</b> to the IC model which is: the actor who is activated in time t cannot activate those actors who have been linked with him/her before the time t. To explain this <b>activation</b> <b>rule</b> in more detail, we define the following terms: [...]...|$|E

While relatively simple and inherently distributed in nature, suitably designed backlog-based CSMA schemes provide the striking capability {{to match the}} optimal throughput performance of centralized scheduling mechanisms {{in a wide range}} of scenarios. The specific type of <b>activation</b> <b>rules</b> for which throughput optimality has been established, may however yield excessive backlogs and delays. Motivated by that issue, we examine whether the poor delay performance is inherent to the basic CSMA operation of these schemes, or caused by the specific kind of <b>activation</b> <b>rules.</b> We first establish lower bounds for the delay in the case of fixed activation rates. The bounds indicate that the delay can dramatically grow with the load in certain topologies.

40|$|Although {{semantic}} dementia {{is primarily}} characterised by deficits in semantic memory, episodic memory is also impaired. Patients show poor recall of old autobiographical and semantic memories, with better retrieval of recent experiences; they can form new memories, and normal performance on pictorial recognition memory has been demonstrated. As these abnormalities in episodic memory are virtually {{a mirror image}} of those seen in the amnesic syndromes, semantic dementia poses a challenge to extant models of remote memory and amnesia. Here, we show that one such model, TraceLink, can reproduce some of the principal findings on episodic memory in semantic dementia. A loss of nodes and connections within the trace system, which can be identified with the temporal neocortical memory storage sites implicated in semantic dementia, simulates without further assumptions the findings reported above.

The <b>activation</b> <b>rule</b> is made simpler requiring less computational effort. In the second model, we show how to combine lateral connections with metrical relations on the activation and the learning rules of DCL to effectively estimate cluster centroids.

The approach taken here utilizes a hybrid neuro-fuzzy method where the neural network effectively chooses the optimum number of <b>activation</b> <b>rules</b> {{in order to reduce}} computational time for real-time applications. Initially, a classical fuzzy logic controller has been constructed for the path planning problem. The inference engine required 625 if-then rules for its implementation.

The problem of supporting large complex rule programs within database management systems still presents significant challenges.

In this paper we present performance results for the DATEX database rule system and its novel indexing technique for supporting rule activation. Our approach assumes that both the rule program and the database must be optimized syn-ergistically. However, as an experimental result we have deter-mined that DATEX requires very few changes to a standard DBMS environment, and we argue that these changes are reasonable for the problems being solved. Based on the performance of DATEX we believe we have demonstrated a satisfactory solution to the rule activation problem for complex rule programs operating within a database system. ...|$|E

The selection of one or several best designs is a common problem people meet in real situations. The research originally focused on the one best design selection problem, the two-stage procedure.

40|$|The {{history of}} {{classical}} conditioning is summarized. The contributions {{and weaknesses of}} several earlier models of classical conditioning are studied. Two new neuronal models are proposed. The first, called the delay-producing connections (or DPC) model, {{is an extension of}} the Klopf (1988) and Sutton & Barto (1981) models. The DPC model makes two contributions: (1) it represents the trace of each conditioned stimuli (CS) by differential equations; and (2) it replaces each CS in the <b>activation</b> <b>rule</b> with a trace of the relevant CS. A method is suggested to measure the trace of a CS. The second model, called the adaptive delays (or AD) model, is proposed {{as an extension of the}} DPC model to account for the phenomenon of inhibition of delay. Both models reproduce the shape of a CR, the curve of efficacy of conditioning as a function of the interstimulus interval (ISI), the dependence of the optimal ISI on CS duration, the extinction of a CR (even for long lasting CSs as opposed to Klopf's (1988) model), and several other properties of classical conditioning...|$|E

The primary aim {{of this study is to}} identify optimal patient-centered rapid response team (RRT) <b>activation</b> <b>rules</b> using electronic medical records (EMR) -derived Markovian models. MethodsThe setting for the observational cohort study included 38, 356 adult general floor patients hospitalized in 2011. The national early warning score (NEWS) was used to measure the patient health condition. Chi-square and Kruskal Wallis tests were used to identify statistically significant subpopulations as a function of the admission type (medical or surgical), frailty as measured by the Braden skin score, and history of prior clinical deterioration (RRT, cardiopulmonary arrest, or unscheduled ICU transfer). ResultsStatistical tests identified 12 statistically significant subpopulations which differed clinically, as measured by length of stay and time to re-admission (P<. 001). The Chi-square test of independence results showed a dependency structure between subsequent states in the embedded Markov chains (P<. 001). The SMDP models identified two sets of subpopulation-specific RRT <b>activation</b> <b>rules</b> for each statistically unique subpopulation. Clinical deterioration experience in prior hospitalizations did not change the RRT <b>activation</b> <b>rules.</b> The thresholds differed as a function of admission type and frailty. ConclusionsEWS were used to identify personalized thresholds for RRT activation for statistically significant Markovian patient subpopulations as a function of frailty and admission type.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{have resulted in}} queue-based algorithms for medium access control which operate in a distributed fashion, and yet achieve the optimal throughput performance of centralized scheduling algorithms. However, fundamental performance bounds reveal that the "cautious" <b>activation</b> <b>rules</b> involved in establishing throughput optimality tend to produce extremely large delays, typically growing exponentially in 1 /(1 -r), with r the load of the system, {{in contrast to the}} usual linear growth. Motivated by that issue, we explore to what extent more "aggressive" schemes can improve the delay performance. Our main finding is that aggressive <b>activation</b> <b>rules</b> induce a lingering effect, where individual nodes retain possession of a shared resource for excessive lengths of time even while a majority of other nodes idle. Using central limit theorem type arguments, we prove that the idleness induced by the lingering effect may cause the delays to grow with 1 /(1 -r) at a quadratic rate. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first mathematical results illuminating the lingering effect and quantifying the performance impact.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} Sparse Disn-ibuted Memory (SDM) (Kanerva, 1988) is presented. SDM is an associative memory {{which can be}} thought of as a 3 -layer Artificial Neural Network. It uses massive parallelism, associates very large patterns, and is trained rapidly. The theory of SDM was developed for uncorrelated bit _. In this paper the behavior of SDM is examined when the constraint of random input is violated and the memory is presented with highly-correlated dam for classification tasks. Experiments from the domain of discrete-word speech recognition are used. These experiments lead, in a step-by-step manner, to factors which improve the memory's ability to recall and to generalize. It is shown that generaliTAtion can be enhanced with appropriate appLication of: (1) the form of encoding of class labels, (2) the placement of hard locations within the memory, (3) the <b>activation</b> <b>rule</b> of hard locations, and (4) the write rule used to modify the memory.

40|$|Previously, {{a method}} was {{described}} of representing {{a class of}} simple visual images {{so that they could}} be used with a Sparse Distributed Memory (SDM). Herein, two possible implementations are described of a SDM, for which these images, suitably encoded, will serve both as addresses to the memory and as data to be stored in the memory. A key feature of both implementations is that a pattern that is represented as an unordered set with a variable number of members can be used as an address to the memory. In the 1 st model, an image is encoded as a 9072 bit string {{to be used as a}} read or write address; the bit string may also be used as data to be stored in the memory. Another representation, in which an image is encoded as a 256 bit string, may be used with either model as data to be stored in the memory, but not as an address. In the 2 nd model, an image is not represented as a vector of fixed length to be used as an address. Instead, a rule is given for determining which memory locations are to be activated in response to an encoded image. This <b>activation</b> <b>rule</b> treats the pieces of an image as an unordered set. With this model, the memory can be simulated, based on a method of computing the approximate result of a read operation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we analyze {{and extend the}} neural network based {{associative}} memory proposed by Gripon and Berrou. This associative memory resembles the celebrated Will-shaw model with an added partite cluster structure. In the literature, two retrieving schemes have been proposed for the network dynamics, namely SUM-OF-SUM and SUM-OF-MAX. They both offer considerably better performance than Willshaw and Hopfield networks, when comparable retrieval scenarios are considered. Former discussions and experiments concentrate on the erasure scenario, where a partial message {{is used as a}} probe to the network, in the hope of retrieving the full message. In this regard, SUM-OF-MAX outperforms SUM-OF-SUM in terms of retrieval rate by a large margin. However, we observe that when noise and errors are present and the network is queried by a corrupt probe, SUM-OF-MAX faces a severe limitation as its stringent <b>activation</b> <b>rule</b> prevents a neuron from reviving back into play once deactivated. In this manuscript, we categorize and analyze different error scenarios so that both the erasure and the corrupt scenarios can be treated consistently. We make an amendment to the network structure to improve the retrieval rate, at the cost of an extra scalar per neuron. Afterwards, five different approaches are proposed to deal with corrupt probes. As a result, we extend the network capability, and also increase the robustness of the retrieving procedure. We then experimentally compare all these proposals and discuss pros and cons of each approach under different types of errors. Simulation results show that if carefully designed, the network is able to preserve both a high retrieval rate and a low running time simultaneously, even when queried by a corrupt probe...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we develop a {{mathematical}} analysis for a dynamic model of peeling test in dimension one. In {{the first part}} we give existence and uniqueness results for dynamic evolutions. In the second part we study the quasistatic limit of such evolutions, i. e., the limit as inertia tends to zero. In the model the wave equation u_tt-u_xx= 0 is coupled with a Griffith's criterion for the propagation of the debonding front. Our first results provide existence and uniqueness for {{the solution to this}} coupled problem under different assumptions on the data. This analysis is extended when we study the initiation of the debonding process. We also give an existence and uniqueness result for solutions to the damped wave equation u_tt-u_xx+u_t= 0 in a time-dependent domain whose evolution depends on the given debonding front. We then analyse the quasistatic limit without damping. We find that the limit evolution satisfies a stability condition; however, the <b>activation</b> <b>rule</b> in Griffith's (quasistatic) criterion does not hold in general, thus the limit evolution is not rate-independent. This behaviour is due to the oscillations of the kinetic energy and of the presence of an acceleration term in the limit. The same phenomenon is observed even {{in the case of a}} singularly perturbed second order equation ^ 2 ü_ + V_x(t,u_(t)) = 0, where V(t,x) is a potential. We assume that u_ 0 (t) is one of its equilibrium points such that V_x(t,u_ 0 (t)) = 0 and V_xx(t,u_ 0 (t)) > 0. We find that, under suitable initial data, the solutions u_ converge uniformly to u_ 0, by imposing mild hypotheses on V. However, a counterexample shows that such assumptions cannot be weakened. Thus, inertial effects can not, in general, be captured by a pure quasistatic analysis...|$|E

Such rules provide a general mechanism for a number of database features such as integrity constraint checking and view maintenance, and simplify building and reasoning about database applications. In general, <b>rule</b> <b>activations</b> in active databases can &quot;cascade, &quot; i. e., the execution of an active rule can cause a change in the database state that causes another rule to be executed; the resulting change can then cause the activation of a third rule; and so on.
