5|$|Chhinnamasta {{is often}} named as the fifth or sixth Mahavidya (Mahavidyas are {{a group of}} ten fearsome goddesses from the Hindu escoetric {{tradition}} of Tantra), with hymns identifying her as a fierce aspect of Devi, the Hindu Mother goddess.

The Guhyatiguhya-Tantra (c. 9th century) equates the god Vishnu's ten avatars with the ten Mahavidyas; the man-lion avatar Narasimha is described to have arisen from Chhinnamasta. A similar list in Mundamala Tantra (pre-16th century) equates Chhinnamasta with the avatar Parshurama.|$|E

5|$|Feminist {{literary}} critics see the poem as portraying women's ultimate power over men.

Gawain's misogynist passage, in which he blames all of his troubles on women <b>and</b> <b>lists</b> the many men who have fallen prey to women's wiles, further supports the feminist view of ultimate female power in the poem.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{low gross}} on its initial release, Manhunter grew in {{popularity}} by the 2000s {{and has been}} mentioned in several books <b>and</b> <b>lists</b> of cult films.

5|$|It is, as an Upanishad, {{a part of}} {{the corpus}} of Vedanta {{literature}} that presents the philosophical concepts of Hinduism.

The text describes the Jivanmukta as one whose inner state, amongst other things, is neither affected by happiness nor by suffering inflicted on him, who does not shrink out of fear from the world, nor the world shrinks from him with fear, and whose sense of calm and inner contentment is free from anger, fear, and joy toward others.|$|E

5|$|Many {{basketball}} analysts, coaches, fans, {{and current}} and former players consider James {{to be one of}} the greatest players of all-time, often ranking him as the best small forward and in the top five overall. He has earned All-NBA honors every season since his sophomore year, All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014, and was named Rookie of the Year in his debut season. With four MVP awards, he is part of a select group of players who have won the award four times, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only two players who have won four MVP awards in a five-year span.

5|$|Sources {{pertaining}} to the Singora cannon's journey to London include the Hmannan Yazawin (the first official chronicle of Burma's Konbaung Dynasty) and reports written by General Sir Harry Prendergast, commander of the Burma Expeditionary Force that captured Mandalay in the third Anglo-Burmese war. The Hmannan Yazawin provides an inventory of weapons taken by the Burmese after the sack of Ayuthaya, noting that most guns were destroyed and only the finest pieces conveyed to Burma. Correspondence between General Prendergast and his superiors in India details ordnance seized during the Burma campaign <b>and</b> <b>lists</b> cannon sent as presents to Queen Victoria, the Viceroy of India, British governors of Madras and Bombay, the Royal Naval College in Greenwich, Portsmouth and Plymouth dockyards, and the Royal Hospital Chelsea.

5|$|The {{production}} was {{for most of}} the filming a closed set, with great measures taken to maintain the secrecy of the plot. Scripts were numbered <b>and</b> <b>lists</b> kept of who received each copy. The press was told nothing about the story and only a few production stills were allowed to be published. During construction one young visitor to a soundstage stole a copy of blueprints for the bridge set and sold duplicates of them to any fans who would pay him $75; Paramount reported the matter to the FBI, who turned the case over to the Los Angeles Police Department. The police arrested, convicted, and fined the culprit $750; it was later discovered that the stolen plans were not the final copies. Visitor's badges were created to keep track of guests, and due to the limited number were constantly checked out; among the visitors included friends of the cast and crew, the press, fan leaders, and actors such as Clint Eastwood, Tony Curtis, Robin Williams, and Mel Brooks. Security swept cars leaving the lots for stolen items; even the principal actors were not spared from this inconvenience.|$|E
