5|$|After drying, the {{harvested}} stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 {{hours or}} more in the umu tī pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate fructan in the stems to very sweet fructose. The cooked stems or rhizomes were then ﬂattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry until {{the time came to}} add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water <b>and</b> <b>chewed,</b> and was said to smell and taste like molasses.|$|E
5|$|Such a {{depiction}} {{is common}} in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature. Robert T. Bakker has extended social behavior to parental care, and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth <b>and</b> <b>chewed</b> bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to lairs for their young to eat until they were grown, and prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food. However, there is actually little evidence of gregarious behavior in theropods, and social interactions {{with members of the}} same species would have included antagonistic encounters, as shown by injuries to gastralia and bite wounds to skulls (the pathologic lower jaw named Labrosaurus ferox is one such possible example). Such head-biting may have been a way to establish dominance in a pack or to settle territorial disputes.|$|E
25|$|After being {{deposited}} {{in their final}} resting places the carcasses were torn apart, had their bones trampled <b>and</b> <b>chewed</b> by scavengers. These processes left the abrasion and toothmarks seen on the bones preserved at H97-02. Chemical reactions between the decaying dinosaur flesh and floodwaters caused iron to precipitate {{out of the water}} and formed the ironstone concretions commonly found in the mudrock hosting the mega-bonebed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{preliminary}} suit {{went after}} Clark's executors, Relf <b>and</b> <b>Chew,</b> {{accusing them of}} fraudulent mismanagement of Clarks's estate assets. The specific claims alleged Relf <b>and</b> <b>Chew</b> had acted fraudulently by pretending that Clark endorsed to them a loan made to Davis. Another claim also accused Relf <b>and</b> <b>Chew</b> of destroying the 1813 will that left most of Clark's fortune to Gaines. [...] In response, the executors denied the allegations and further argued that Clark had never been married to Carrière, had no legitimate descendants, and left his estate to his mother. Additionally, they presented evidence that Mary Clark granted power of attorney to Relf <b>and</b> <b>Chew</b> to act on her behalf in all matters that related to Clark's estate. [...] Finally, they explained that managing Clark's estate was complicated {{as a result of}} defective land titles.|$|R

25|$|In Italy (particularly in the south), Spain and France, {{liquorice}} {{is popular}} {{in its natural}} form.

In Calabria a popular liqueur is made from pure liquorice extract.|$|E
25|$|Khat is a {{plant that}} is mainly grown in East Africa and the Middle East. Its leaves are chewed for their {{stimulating}} properties, primarily by people from these regions. Within Somali culture especially, khat chewing {{has a long history}} as a social custom that traditionally brings people together to relax and to encourage conversation. Some people also use it to help them stay alert during work or school. Ordinarily, khat use would be limited to specific periods of the day and session durations. A 2007 source reports that khat was readily available at that time in mafrishes, commercial establishments where the substance was sold <b>and</b> <b>chewed.</b> Within the Somali community as well as other groups with khat-chewing traditions, the activity was generally perceived as legitimate and not censured like alcohol and illegal drug use are within those same communities. However, in June 2014, khat use was made illegal in the UK.|$|E
25|$|Children's {{clothing}} (mikelnguut aturait) {{was made}} of soft skin of younger animals. Reindeer fawn and dog puppy skin parkas, with the fur inside, were made for babies (irniaq) and small children (mikelnguq). Puppies one and two months old were killed for the purpose. Fawn and puppy skins were turned inside out, scraped, hung out to dry, and then put away. When needed the skins were taken from storage, rubbed between the hands with a rotary motion, <b>and</b> <b>chewed</b> as necessary to soften and loosen tissue that had not previously been removed. For a sealskin parka, one skin was required for a three-year-old, two for a five- or six-year-old, and three for a child of 10 or 12 years. A small child's sealskin parka was often decorated with tassels of the same material stitched to the upper center of the back. A baby's boots were always made with the fur inside but otherwise were similar in construction to adult boots. In former times, babies wore long boots and no pants. When a child was toilet trained, pants separate from boots were put on a boy, while girls were given trouser-boots like those worn by women.|$|E

40|$|We have {{characterized}} mutants {{in a novel}} gene of Bacillus subtilis, cheV, which encodes {{a protein}} homologous to both <b>CheW</b> <b>and</b> CheY. A null mutant in cheV is only slightly defective in capillary and tethered cell assays. However, a double mutant lacking both CheV <b>and</b> <b>CheW</b> has a strong tumble bias, does not respond to addition of attractant, and shows essentially no accumulation in capillary assays. Thus, CheV <b>and</b> <b>CheW</b> appear in part to be functionally redundant. A strain lacking <b>CheW</b> <b>and</b> expressing only the CheW domain of CheV is chemotactic, suggesting that the truncated CheV protein retains in vivo function. We speculate that CheV <b>and</b> <b>CheW</b> function together to couple CheA activation to methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein receptor status and that possible CheA-dependent phosphorylation of CheV contributes to adaptation...|$|R

25|$|Flavor {{delivery}} is extended throughout the mastication process by timed release of different flavor components {{due to the}} physical-chemical properties of many of chewing gum’s ingredients. Entropy is {{a key player in}} the process of flavor delivery; because some gum components are more soluble in saliva than gum base and because over time flavor components desire to increase their entropy by becoming dispersed in the less ordered system of the mouth than in the more ordered system of the gum bolus, flavor delivery occurs. During the first three to four minutes of the chew, bulking agents such as sugar or sorbitol and maltitol have the highest solubility and, therefore, are chewed out first. As these components dissolve in the consumers’ saliva and slide down the esophagus, they are no longer retained in the gum base or perceived by the chewer. During the next phase of the chew in the four to six minute range, intense sweeteners and some acids are dissolved <b>and</b> <b>chewed</b> out. These components last slightly longer than the bulking agents because they have a slightly lower solubility. Next, encapsulated flavors are released during either 10-15 minute into the chew or after 30–45 minutes. Encapsulated flavors remain incorporated in the gum base longer because the molecules that they are encapsulated in are more easily held within the gum matrix. Finally, during the last phase of the chew, softeners such as corn syrup and glycerin and other textural modifiers are dissolved, resulting in a firming up of the gum {{and the end of the}} chew.|$|E

The large and unusually aggressive bull had already attacked <b>and</b> <b>chewed</b> to pieces two pursuing whaleboats before eventually turning on the Ann Alexander itself and ramming it just above the keel at an estimated speed of 15 knots. The crew were forced to abandon ship, but unlike the Essex all were recovered safely within days.
