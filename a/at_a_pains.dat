40|$|Objective: Although {{effective}} {{treatments for}} pain and distress are available, many patients do not access them. Improved understanding of patients’ desire for help may improve uptake of services. Methods: Data were collected {{as part of}} the QUICATOUCH screening program <b>at</b> <b>an</b> Australian regional hospital. Patients over threshold for pain were asked if they would like help with their pain and those over threshold for distress were asked if they would like help with their distress. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify independent predictors of desire for help. Results: Of 305 patients over threshold for pain; 59 % wanted help, increasing from 13 % <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> score of one to 90 % <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> score of 10. Of 274 patients over threshold for distress, 30 % wanted help, increasing from 21 % <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distress score of four to 41 % <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distress score of 10. Pain score was the only significant independent predictor of desire for help with <b>pain,</b> with <b>an</b> odds ratio (OR) of 1. 50 (95 %CI 1. 33 - 1. 70) for every point increase in pain score. Distress score was the only significant independent predictor of desire for help with distress with an OR of 1. 29 (95 %CI 1. 11 - 1. 50) for every point increase in distress score. Conclusions: Although desire for help with pain and distress increased with respective symptom intensity, many patients indicated they did not want help with these symptoms. Patient reluctance to seek help may constitute a barrier to realising the full potential of screening programs in reducing pain and distress...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The goal of {{this study}} was to examine the {{relative}} contribution of helplessness, fear of pain, and passive pain-coping to pain level, disability, and depression in chronic <b>pain</b> patients attending <b>an</b> interdisciplinary <b>pain</b> center. METHODS: One hundred sixty-nine chronic pain patients who had entered treatment <b>at</b> <b>an</b> interdisciplinary <b>pain</b> center completed various questionnaires and <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> diary. RESULTS: Helplessness, fear of pain, and passive pain-coping strategies were all related to the pain level, disability, and depression. When comparing the contribution of the predictors in multiple regression analyses, helplessness was the only significant predictor for pain level. Helplessness and the passive behavioral pain-coping strategies of resting significantly predicted disability. The passive cognitive pain-coping strategy of worrying significantly predicted depression.

Consistent with theoretical propositions, more resilient individuals with chronic pain also reported better social support, and were more likely to be working. Results also showed that higher resilience was associated with greater pain self-efficacy. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed, and revealed that resilience did not add significantly to the prediction of depression scores and disability scores, over and above the contribution made by existing measures of pain coping. Hence it is concluded that the concept of resilience adds a small but important element to the understanding of adjustment in chronic pain...|$|R
40|$|Background: There {{is a lack}} of {{research}} about a potential education-related bias in assessment of patients with chronic pain. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze whether low-educated men and women with chronic pain were less often selected to multidisciplinary rehabilitation than those with high education. Methods: The population consisted of consecutive patients (n = 595 women, 266 men) referred during a three-year period from mainly primary health care centers for a multidisciplinary team assessment <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> rehabilitation clinic <b>at</b> <b>a</b> university hospital in Northern Sweden. Patient data were collected from the Swedish Quality Registry for Pain Rehabilitation National Pain Register. The outcome variable was being selected by the multidisciplinary team assessment to a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program. The independent variables were: sex, age, born outside Sweden, education, pain severity as well as the hospital, anxiety and depression scale (HADS). Results: Low-educated women were less often selected to multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs than high-educated women (OR 0. 55, CI 0. 30 – 0. 98), even after control for age, being born outside Sweden, pain intensity and HADS. No significant findings were found when comparing the results between high- and low-educated men.

40|$|Background and aim: Chronic <b>pain</b> is <b>a</b> major problem, {{often with}} {{comorbidity}} of insomnia, mental disorders and limitations in function, activity and participation, all leading to poor quality of life. Patients describe their pain as unpredictable and ‘invisible’ thus influencing being and communication. Patients with chronic pain are treated in primary care, pain clinics and rehabilitation units. Pain-clinic patients represent {{a wide range}} of diagnoses and knowledge of these settings is limited. The overall aim of the work presented in this thesis was to explore aspects of living with chronic pain among patients attending <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> clinic. Methods and results: Three studies resulting in four papers were performed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> clinic where patient-adapted treatment alternatives included conventional, mainly pharmacological, pain treatment (CPT) and a team-based multimodal rehabilitation programme (MMR). In Study I, interviews with 14 informants (13 female, age 23 - 77) who had participated in MMR one year earlier were analysed using content analysis. The core theme “Change is possible” and the themes “A life ruled by pain” (the situation before rehabilitation), “The penny’s dropped” (experience during rehabilitation) and “Live a life, not only survive” (the situation {{at the time of the}} interviews) emerged from the data. The process describes how the informants could integrate earlier disabling symptoms into a well-functioning lifestyle (Paper I). Study II was a longitudinal, observational study of patients assessed and treated. Patientreported outcome measures (PROM) of health-related quality of life (EQ- 5 D), pain (VAS), anxiety and depression (HADS), insomnia (ISI), pain related disability (PDI), kinesiophobia (TSK) and sense of coherence (SOC) were collected at the first visit and one year later. Data were analysed according to the treatment alternatives: MMR-group (n= 42) (Paper II) and CPT-group (n= 271) as well as patients assessed and referred (AOgroup, n= 47) (Paper III). The baseline showed substantial problems in PROM with the worst state in the MMR-group. Significant improvements (p < 0. 05) were found in the follow-up of both treatment groups in EQ- 5 D, ISI, PDI and TSK in the MMR-group. The CPT-group improved also in VAS, while the AO-group did not change. Study III: In this qualitative study 13 women with painful endometriosis, treated with CPT, were included. Sixteen interviews were analysed according to grounded theory. The theory as developed describes the experience of endometriosis and its treatment in the core category. “Surviving painful endometriosis, struggle for coherence”, formed from the categories “Woman with painful endometriosis”, “Dependence” and “A ruined life”. Conclusions: The analysis of interviews and questionnaires of patients with chronic <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> clinic showed congruent findings: complex suffering, with significant influence of the pain condition on living and health. In the follow-up of minor or comprehensive interventions, improvement was found in several outcomes and patients described a change to a well-functioning life. However, ongoing problems remained, pointing to the chronicity of the condition. To live a good life with chronic pain requires the sufferer to understand her or his situation, to use functional coping strategies and to find support in significant others and health care, thus integrating the chronic condition...|$|R

We describe our experience with patients who developed spinal or paraspinal infection after injection of contaminated methylprednisolone. Methods. Data were assembled from the Michigan Department of Community Health, electronic medical re-cords, and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) reports. Results. Of 544 patients who received an epidural injection from a contaminated lot of methylprednisolone <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> clinic in southeastern Michigan, 153 (28 %) were diagnosed at our institution with probable or confirmed spinal or paraspinal fungal infection at the injection site. Forty-one patients had both meningitis and spinal or paraspinal infection, and 112 had only spinal or paraspinal infection. Magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities included ab-scess, phlegmon, arachnoiditis, and osteomyelitis. Surgical debridement in 116 patients revealed epidural phlegmon and epidural abscess most often. Among 26 patients with an abnormal MRI but with no increase or change in chron-ic pain, 19 (73 %) had infection identified at surgery. Fungal infection was confirmed in 78 patients (51 %) by finding hyphae in tissues, positive polymerase chain reaction, or culture.

40|$|Aim: This paper {{aimed to}} examine how {{patients}} with chronic back pain understand and experience the messages about pain and treatment in their first specialist medical (pain clinic) consultation. It also aimed to compare what doctors believe they communicated with patients’ own ‘take home’ messages. Method: Sixteen patients were interviewed immediately after their first consultation <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> clinic, and their corresponding doctors were interviewed shortly afterwards. Thematic analysis {{was conducted on the}} patient interviews to address the first research aim, and then framework analysis was employed to compare understandings of the consultation within the patient-doctor dyads. Results: Thematic analysis of patient interviews resulted in four higher-order themes: the central role of medical treatments in the treatment of pain; a dilemma about hoping when there are ‘no guarantees’; the importance of trying all recommended medical interventions and, for a minority of patients, relief to be recommended non-medical pain management. Although there was considerable overlap within the patient-doctor dyads, clinically relevant areas of mismatch included the explanation of pain, the likely long-term treatment plan, and patients’ role in their treatment. Conclusions: Patients’ understandings of the consultation messages seemed to influence their beliefs about the likelihood of their pain being relieved, and their sense of control over it. There seemed notable areas of mismatch between doctors’ and patients’ understandings of the consultation which are likely to impact upon treatment success and patient satisfaction...|$|R

This {{paper is}} a report of a study {{exploring}} the impact of neuropathic pain on family, social and working relationships among patients <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> clinic serving <b>a</b> large urban area. Background. Neuropathic <b>pain</b> is <b>a</b> particularly distressing type of chronic pain which {{is extremely difficult to}} manage successfully. It produces a range of unpleasant symptoms and adversely affects patients' quality of life, but little is known about its personal impact. Method. A descriptive and exploratory approach was used and 10 participants participated in three focus groups in 2005. Because of the low response rate of 20 % from the initial sample, a second sample of 16 patients was invited to participate. However, only one person responded and therefore {{it was not possible to}} convene an additional group. Findings. The unpleasant and bizarre nature of neuropathic pain underpinned much of its impact in terms of respondents' difficulties in maintaining a range of relationships. For closer relationships, key difficulties centred on the reduction in quality and/or number of personal relationships. For more distant relationships and those with professionals, frustration at the invisibility of their pain and their own failure to communicate symptoms and its consequences were central. Conclusion. More extensive work is needed to improve our understanding of how neuropathic pain is experienced, how it affects close and more distant kinds of relationships, and how healthcare professionals might best support people with persistent neuropathic pain to maintain personal and social relationships, and to communicate their pain effectively...|$|R

40|$|AB Purpose: In {{clinical}} practice, it {{is often}} noted that some individuals struggle with chronic pain, while others find effective means to cope. The {{purpose of this study}} was to better understand how resilience fits into coping with persistent pain problems. Of interest was whether measures of resilience add to the prediction of adjustment to chronic pain over and above measures of pain coping as typically used with this patient group. Method: Individuals (N = 101) with chronic <b>pain</b> who attended <b>an</b> initial assessment <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> clinic completed self-report measures of resilience and coping. Pain related outcome data were also collected. Results: Bivariate correlations indicated that higher resilience was associated with significantly less fear avoidance, less pain-related disability, and lower reported pain intensity. Consistent with theoretical propositions, bivariate analyses also indicated that more resilient individuals with chronic pain reported better social support, and were more likely to be working. Higher resilience was also positively correlated with greater pain self-efficacy. However, when hierarchical regression analyses were performed, resilience did not add significantly to the prediction of depression scores and disability scores, over and above the contribution made by existing measures of pain coping. Conclusion: These findings suggest that, although the construct of resilience appears to have important relationships with various dimensions of chronic pain, as currently operationalized, it does not add significantly to the understanding of chronic-pain adjustment. Rather than abandoning the resilience construct, our findings suggest that resilience as applied to the problem of chronic <b>pain</b> may require <b>a</b> refinement in measurement with this population...|$|R

DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized double-blind study was performed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pain</b> clinic of Universidade Federal de São Paulo. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with pain for more than three months, of intensity greater than three on a numerical scale (zero to 10), were included. G 1 patients received 1 mg (1 ml) of morphine diluted in 9 ml of saline, intra-articularly, and G 2 patients received 25 mg (10 ml) of 0. 25 % bupivacaine without epinephrine. Pain was assessed on a numerical scale and knee flexion and extension angles were measured after administration of the drugs at rest and during movement. The total amount of analgesic supplementation using 500 mg doses of paracetamol was also determined. RESULTS: No significant difference in pain intensity was observed between G 1 and G 2. Significant decreases in pain at rest and during movement and significant increases in mean flexion and extension angles were observed in both groups, with no significant difference between the two groups. The mean total amount of paracetamol used over a seven-day period was 3578 mg in G 1 and 5333 mg in G 2 (P = 0. 2355; Mann-Whitney test).

The unpleasant and bizarre nature of neuropathic pain underpinned much of its impact in terms of respondents' difficulties in maintaining a range of relationships. For closer relationships, key difficulties centred on the reduction in quality and/or number of personal relationships. For more distant relationships and those with professionals, frustration at the invisibility of their pain and their own failure to communicate symptoms and its consequences were central. More extensive work is needed to improve our understanding of how neuropathic pain is experienced, how it affects close and more distant kinds of relationships, and how healthcare professionals might best support people with persistent neuropathic pain to maintain personal and social relationships, and to communicate their pain effectively...|$|R
50|$|With {{the years}} of {{frequent}} hospitalizations passed, Theresa is now able to keep her diseases <b>at</b> <b>a</b> controlled <b>pain</b> tolerance with <b>a</b> number of different treatments. Some medications used for the specific Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Theresa suffers from include Corticosteroids and Antimalarials. Because Theresa's pain varies from day to day, she found comfort in reading and writing. In 2011, Theresa began writing in her blog, One Moment One Life. The blog started small, but Theresa's voice for Lupus sufferers began to be heard worldwide, eventually being recognized by the How To Be Sick author, Toni Bernhard. Toni Bernhard currently writes for Psychology Today and, in August 2014, she published an article done by Theresa titled When Chronic Illness Makes You World Weary. Theresa continues to write today.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Based on the fear-avoidance and {{helplessness}} models, {{the relative}} contribution {{of fear of}} pain, avoidance behavior, worrying, and helplessness were examined in relation to fluctuations in functional disability in chronic-pain patients. METHODS: A cohort of 181 chronic-pain patients first completed various questionnaires and kept <b>a</b> 7 -day <b>pain</b> journal during <b>a</b> standard 3 -month waiting-list period prior to their scheduled treatment <b>at</b> <b>an</b> Interdisciplinary <b>Pain</b> Centre and did so again immediately preceding the intervention. RESULTS: At baseline, fear of pain, avoidance behavior, and helplessness all predicted functional disability after 3 months. Stepwise regression analyses showed avoidance behavior to be the strongest predictor of change in functional disability followed by helplessness, thus both ahead of fear of pain. CONCLUSION: The current findings support the roles of both fear-avoidance factors and helplessness in the functional disability in chronic-pain patients awaiting treatment but revealed a central role for avoidance behavior...|$|R
30|$|Although 23.7 % of {{patients}} in last follow-up continued to have some symptoms in the knee or leg, most of these {{were considered to be}} minor and did not impact their activity level. The retrospective nature of our study does not allow us to quantitatively score the knee pain preoperatively and compare to the postoperative level, but it is our sense from patient reports that those who remain symptomatic are <b>at</b> <b>a</b> significantly lower <b>pain</b> level postoperatively.|$|R
