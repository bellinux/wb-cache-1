5|$|Looking at {{symbolism}} in religion, Stace {{states that}} {{there are two types of}} predicates applied to God: first, the ethically-neutral sort, such as God being mind, power or personhood. Secondly, the ethical kind, where he is love, mercy, or righteousness. He explains that the former qualities are justified by an appeal to <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> being, and the latter to <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> value. In both cases the more adequate symbol are those that are higher in each hierarchy. In rooting symbolism in hierarchies, Stace explicitly states he is in opposition to Otto who thought religious symbolism was based on analogy between the numen and qualities found in the natural world.|$|E

5|$|After {{the tumultuous}} An Lushan Rebellion (755–763), the early Tang career path of {{officials}} rising in <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> six ministries—with Works given the lowest status and Personnel the highest—was {{changed into a}} system where officials chose specialized careers within {{one of the six}} ministries. The commissions of Salt and Iron, Funds, and Census that were created to deal with immediate financial crisis after An Lushan's insurrection were the influential basis for this change in career paths that became focused within functionally distinct hierarchies. The varied career backgrounds and expertise of early Northern Song officials meant that they were to be given specific assignment to work in only one of the ministries: Personnel, Revenue, Rites, War, Justice, or Works. As China's population increased and regional economies became more complex the central government could no longer handle the separate parts of the empire efficiently. As a result of this, in 1082 the reorganization of the central bureaucracy scrapped the hierarchies of commissions in favor of the early Tang model of officials advancing through <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> ministries, each with different levels of prestige.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{had been}} the {{official}} imperial religion of the Roman Empire, and the first churches were built in England {{in the second half}} of the 4th century, overseen by <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> bishops and priests. Many existing pagan shrines were converted to Christian use and few pagan sites still operated by the 5th century. The collapse of the Roman system in the late 5th century, however, brought about the end of formal Christian religion in the east of England, and the new Germanic immigrants arrived with their own polytheistic gods, including Woden, Thunor and Tiw, still reflected in various English place names. Despite the resurgence of paganism in England, Christian communities still survived in more western areas such as Gloucestershire and Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Despite this setback in his {{official}} career, Zhang was reappointed as Chief Astronomer in 126 after Emperor Shun of Han (r. 125–144) ascended to the throne. His intensive astronomical work was rewarded {{only with the}} rank and salary of 600bushels, or shi, of grain (mostly commuted to coin cash or bolts of silk). To place this number in context, in <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> twenty official ranks, the lowest-paid official earned the rank and salary of 100bushels and the highest-paid official earned 10,000bushels during the Han. The 600-bushel rank was the lowest the emperor could directly appoint to a central government position; any official of lower status was overseen by central or provincial officials of high rank.|$|E

5|$|In {{the theory}} of cluster analysis, the nearest-neighbor chain {{algorithm}} is an algorithm that can speed up several methods for agglomerative hierarchical clustering. These are methods that take a collection of points as input, and create <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> clusters of points by repeatedly merging pairs of smaller clusters to form larger clusters. The clustering methods that the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm {{can be used for}} include Ward's method, complete-linkage clustering, and single-linkage clustering; these all work by repeatedly merging the closest two clusters but use different definitions of the distance between clusters. The cluster distances for which the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm works are called reducible and are characterized by a simple inequality among certain cluster distances.|$|E
5|$|Later {{authors have}} used the term in a {{different}} sense, to mean the delimitation of species (not subspecies or taxa of other ranks), using whatever investigative techniques are available, and including sophisticated computational or laboratory techniques. Thus, Ernst Mayr in 1968 defined beta taxonomy as the classification of ranks higher than species.An understanding of the biological meaning of variation and of the evolutionary origin of groups of related species {{is even more important}} for the second stage of taxonomic activity, the sorting of species into groups of relatives ("taxa") and their arrangement in <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> higher categories. This activity is what the term classification denotes; it is also referred to as beta taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|Technically, a slave {{could not}} own property, but a slave who {{conducted}} business might be {{given access to}} an individual account or fund (peculium) that he could use {{as if it were}} his own. The terms of this account varied depending on the degree of trust and co-operation between owner and slave: a slave with an aptitude for business could be given considerable leeway to generate profit, and might be allowed to bequeath the peculium he managed to other slaves of his household. Within a household or workplace, <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> slaves might exist, with one slave in effect acting as the master of other slaves.|$|E

5|$|The Methodist {{movement}} was growing rapidly in pre-Civil War America, but was beset by disputes about slave-holding {{and the rule}} over the church by bishops, resulting in a formal split into two groups in 1844. The faction in favor of giving church authority to <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> bishops called themselves the Methodist Episcopal Church and took an anti-slavery stance in the north. Those in opposition formed the Methodist Protestant Church in the United States. As the impending Civil War loomed over {{the nation in the}} 1850s, local Towson Methodists continued to worship together at Epsom Chapel.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the Palladian country house {{in the seventeenth century}} separated the family of the householder from the servants. Previously sharing the hall, and bedding down at a master's feet, or door, servants were now given separate small chambers. Sometimes these were placed on a mezzanine floor, as at Kinross. Servants were less visible, using backstairs that kept them away from members of the family and guests and they fulfilled necessary and sometimes unpleasant tasks. They were also fewer in number, of lower social status and predominately female. A country house could have 10 to 20 servants and large houses had more. <b>A</b> <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> positions developed from the butler and housekeeper to footmen and maids. The sexes were increasingly segregated into their own quarters.|$|E
5|$|The {{responsibility}} for supplying the army rested with the praefectus praetorio of the operational sector. He in turn controlled <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> civilian authorities (diocesan vicarii and provincial governors), whose agents collected, stored and delivered {{supplies to the}} troops directly or to predetermined fortified points. The quantities involved were enormous and would require lengthy and elaborate planning for major campaigns. A late legion of 1,000 men would require a minimum of 2.3 tonnes of grain-equivalent every day. An imperial escort army of 25,000 men would thus require around 5,000 tonnes of grain-equivalent for three months' campaigning (plus fodder for the horses and pack animals).|$|E

5|$|Theoretically, {{all life}} forms {{are said to}} deserve full {{protection}} {{from all kinds of}} injury, but Jains recognise <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> life. Mobile beings are given higher protection than immobile ones. For the mobile beings, they distinguish between one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed and five-sensed ones; a one-sensed animal has touch as its only sensory modality. The more senses a being has, the more they care about non-injuring it. Among the five-sensed beings, the precept of non-injury and non-violence to the rational ones (humans) is strongest in Jain Ahimsa.|$|E
5|$|There are 24 High Courts at {{the state}} and union {{territory}} level of India, which together with the Supreme Court of India at the national level, comprise the country's judicial system.

5|$|There existed <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> pay between {{types of}} auxiliary, with cavalry higher paid than infantry. One recent {{estimate}} {{is that in the}} time of Augustus, the annual pay structure was: eques alaris (gregalis) 263 denarii, eques cohortalis 225, and cohors infantryman 188. The same differentials (of about 20% between grades) seem to have existed at the time of Domitian (r. 81-96). However, Goldsworthy points out that the common assumption that rates of pay were universal across provinces and units is unproven. Pay may have varied according to the origin of the unit.|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} k-valued categorial grammars where a word is {{associated}} to at most k types {{is often used}} {{in the field of}} lexicalized grammars as a fruitful constraint for obtaining several properties like the existence of learning algorithms.

5|$|Weber also {{proposed}} a socioevolutionary model of religious change, showing that in general, societies {{have moved from}} magic to polytheism, then to pantheism, monotheism and finally, ethical monotheism. According to Weber, this evolution occurred as the growing economic stability allowed professionalisation {{and the evolution of}} ever more sophisticated priesthood. As societies grew more complex and encompassed different groups, <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> gods developed and as power in the society became more centralised, the concept of a single, universal God became more popular and desirable.|$|E
5|$|Above the course, zones {{four and}} five, as {{identified}} by Cockerell, contain figures which represent the Christian Church in Britain, with the spiritual lords such as bishops, abbots, abbesses and saintly founders of monasteries on the south, while kings, queens and princes occupy the north.

There is <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> size, with the more significant figures larger and enthroned in their niches rather than standing. Immediately beneath the upper course are a series of small niches containing dynamic sculptures of the dead coming forth from their tombs on the Day of Judgement.

5|$|Although Fodor {{originally}} {{rejected the}} idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, he has in recent years devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposes reductive accounts of the mind. He argues that mental states are multiply realizable {{and that there is}} <b>a</b> <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses.
