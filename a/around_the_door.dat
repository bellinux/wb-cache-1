5|$|Corder {{was taken}} back to Suffolk where he was tried at Shire Hall, Bury St Edmunds. The trial started on 7 August 1828, having been put back several days because of the {{interest}} which the case had generated. The hotels in Bury St Edmunds began to fill up from as early as 21 July, and admittance to the court was by ticket {{only because of the}} large numbers who wanted to view the trial. Despite this, the judge and court officials still had to push their way bodily through the crowds that had gathered <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{shows the}} moment at which Gyges, hiding behind the door, first catches sight of Nyssia's naked body. Candaules lies naked in bed, while Nyssia undresses as she prepares to join him, and Gyges tiptoes <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{to catch a glimpse}} of her. Nyssia holds a piece of fabric, which forms a {{vertical}} line cutting off the body of Candaules at the top of his legs, invoking a theme of emasculation at the hands of a powerful woman. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge. The cluttered arrangement of drapery and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.|$|E
25|$|Walton {{also ordered}} the storm {{door at the}} {{entrance}} to the White House beneath the North Portico removed so that the coffin would pass more easily through the portal. The door was removed, but the frame (embedded in concrete) was not. Black crepe was tacked <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to cover it. Shriver had the White House driveway lit with small firepots. Kennedy's body arrived at the White House at about 4:30 A.M. The military casket team moved the coffin into the East Room and set it on the catafalque. Walton gave General Godfrey McHugh, Kennedy's chief military aide, a spray of flowers to place at the long base of the catafalque.|$|E

25|$|The artists' {{colony in}} Aurora {{consisted}} of a log cabin tavern on U.S. Route 50, and a lodge and studios (of various sizes, and constructed of various kinds of materials) in the nearby woods. Among the artists, diplomats, philosophers, and writers staying at the colony were the painter Robert Gates and his wife, the physician David Lindsay Watson, the psychiatrist Sigurd Graven and his wife, and the former Latvian diplomat Arved Kundzin. Menke suggested that, to make ends meet, Wentzel use the Voigtländer camera his father had given him to photograph the local area and make postcards for sale. Wentzel converted an old pump house across Route 50 from the tavern into a darkroom, although light leaking through cracks in the walls, <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and from the ceiling forced Wentzel to primarily use it at night.|$|E
500|$|The cathedral {{is defined}} as a domed and centrally-planned basilica. According to Richard Krautheimer it derives its plan from that of the 7th century cathedral of Talin, with only minor differences. The dome was {{supported}} on pendentives and stood atop the [...] "intersection of four barrel vaults elevated to a cruciform design and topped with gabled roofs." [...] In the interior, [...] "freestanding piers divide the space into three aisles, the nave of which terminates in an eastern apse flanked by two story side chapels." [...] Sirarpie Der Nersessian noted that its interior is imposing [...] "through the harmony of the proportions." [...] She added, [...] "The blind arcade with slender columns and ornate arches, the delicate interlaces carved <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and windows add to the beauty of the exterior." ...|$|E
500|$|St Peter's {{is built}} from rubble masonry, with large stones {{at the corners}} of the transepts and {{sandstone}} dressings around some of the apertures. The roof is made of slate; the stone bellcote at the west end has one bell and is topped with a cross. The nave and chancel are the oldest parts of the building. The nave measures 23feet 6inches by 14feet (7.16 by 4.3m); the chancel, which is separated from the nave by a single step, measures 14feet 6inches by 4feet (4.42 by 1.2m). The sanctuary within the chancel is raised by a further step and has a rail around it. The vestry is at the west end of the nave. The transepts to the north and south of the chancel are square in plan, their sides and endsmeasuring approximately [...] [...] The western end of the north wall of the nave has a 15th-century pointed arch doorway set in a square frame, with decorative patterns in the stonework <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and carved heads {{on either side of the}} frame; the head to the left of the frame wears a mitre. A doorway in the opposite wall of the nave, probably also dating from the 15th century, was partially replaced in the 19th century with a window.|$|E
25|$|Vigersted Church near Ringsted is also richly {{decorated}} with wall paintings in <b>the</b> vaults and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> Dated at <b>around</b> 1450, they were rediscovered in the 1890s and later restored.|$|R
50|$|The Bank of Communications Building {{is located}} at No. 14 on the Bund, Shanghai. The {{building}} was designed in a modern Art-Deco style, combined with Chinese elements. It is an eight-story concrete-frame structure, framed by black marble <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> <b>The</b> building is now occupied by {{the offices of the}} Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions.|$|R

500|$|The four-storey tower {{house was}} named the Stirling Tower after the {{original}} lords of Edzell, the Stirlings of Glenesk, {{although it is not}} old enough to have been built by them. It is [...] high, and measures [...] by [...] on plan. The walls are over [...] thick at the basement, narrowing to [...] on the first floor. The tower house is entered from the north, via a door protected by [...] "inverted keyhole" [...] shaped gun holes. A slot adjacent to the door would have held a draw-bar, to reinforce the entry, and several mason's marks remain <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> The hall occupies the first floor, above two vaulted cellars. Marks in the wall show the position of a minstrels' gallery and a timber screen, which concealed a serving area accessed via a narrow stair from the cellar. The broad main spiral stair led up to three further storeys of private chambers, before reaching a caphouse, a small rooftop chamber giving access to a parapet walk. The four corners of the tower have bartizans, or open turrets, and similar projections occur halfway along each wall. The parapet is supported on projecting stones, or corbels, arranged in a pattern of two tiers which alternate, rendering the lower tier purely decorative. Edzell represents an early occurrence of this style, known as chequered corbelling, which became more widespread later in the 16th century.|$|E
2500|$|Although much sculptural {{ornament}} {{was sometimes}} {{applied to the}} interiors of churches, the focus of such decoration was generally the west front, and in particular, the portals. Chevrons and other geometric ornaments, referred to by 19th-century writers as [...] "barbaric ornament", are most frequently found on the mouldings of the central door. Stylized foliage often appears, sometimes deeply carved and curling outward after {{the manner of the}} acanthus leaves on Corinthian capitals, but also carved in shallow relief and spiral patterns, imitating the intricacies of manuscript illuminations. In general, the style of ornament was more classical in Italy, such as that seen <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of San Giusto in Lucca, and more [...] "barbaric" [...] in England, Germany and Scandinavia, such as that seen at Lincoln and Speyer Cathedrals. France produced a great range of ornament, with particularly fine interwoven and spiralling vines in the [...] "manuscript" [...] style occurring at Saint-Sernin, Toulouse.|$|E
2500|$|In {{early winter}} Lake Superior's waves {{splashing}} {{against the stone}} tower of the Stannard Rock Light built a layer of ice that forced maintenance crews to hack away the ice <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to reach the men. If an illness, accident, or fire occurred at the Stannard Rock Light it could be days or even weeks before the keepers got assistance. As one of the rock lighthouses, it was designated as a [...] "stag station" [...] where only men could serve without their families. The keepers called the Stannard Rock Light the [...] "Loneliest Place in the World" [...] and it has always carried {{the distinction of being}} the [...] "loneliest place" [...] in the continental United States. Maritime historian Wes Oleszwski reported that duty at the Stannard Rock Light was so rough that of the keepers and assistant keepers, there were four resignations and three transfers in the first three seasons of the station's operation.|$|E
50|$|Before its {{conversion}} into a museum, {{the interior}} of the building retained much of its original trim, including the cement floor, wainscoting, exposed trusswork ceiling and reed molding and bullseye corner blocks <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although the {{interior}} {{plan has been}} substantially altered from the original town house, many Georgian features have survived on both ground and first floors, including cornices, panelling, architraves <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> and <b>the</b> main staircase {{as well as the}} attic stairs.|$|R
50|$|The {{house has}} a steep sloping broken-back {{corrugated}} iron roof topped by a pyramidal chimney ventilator. External walls are painted pebble dash render over the original sandstone, with plain margins along the base line, wall edges and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} Ducellier alternator {{supplied with}} the early production DMC-12s could not provide enough current to supply the car when all lights and electrical options were on; as a result, the battery would gradually discharge, leaving the driver stranded on the road. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the [...] "safety" [...] lights located <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, further draining the battery. This happened to DeLorean owner Johnny Carson shortly after he was presented with the vehicle. Later cars were fitted from the factory with a higher output Motorola alternator which solved this problem. This also is believed [...] to be the reason behind the improvement in the sound quality of the horn. Earlier models emitted a weak sound, not loud or strong enough {{to be effective in}} normal traffic.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 June de Portes kept {{putting her}} head <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{during a meeting}} and US diplomats testified that she was {{constantly}} coming and going from Reynaud’s office. [...] President Roosevelt's reply to Reynaud's inquiry, stating {{that he could do}} little to help without Congressional approval, was then received on the morning of Sunday 16 June. Churchill’s telegram also arrived that morning, agreeing to an armistice provided the French fleet was moved to British ports, a proposal unacceptable to Darlan, who argued that it would leave France defenceless. De Gaulle was in London for talks about the planned Franco-British Union that afternoon. He telephoned Reynaud to inform him the British Cabinet had agreed. The French Cabinet then met in Bordeaux. Reynaud wanted to fight on; he and Georges Mandel were among the few in the cabinet to support the proposal. Contrary to Lebrun’s mistaken recollection, no formal vote appears to have been taken at Cabinet on Sunday 16 June. The outcome of the meeting is unclear. Ten ministers wanted to fight on while seven favoured an armistice, though these included the two Deputy Prime Ministers: Pétain and Chautemps. An armistice was also favoured by Weygand. Another eight ministers were undecided, but ultimately swung towards an armistice. This time, Lebrun reluctantly accepted Reynaud’s resignation. De Gaulle later wrote that Reynaud was “a man of great worth unjustly crushed by events beyond measure”.|$|E
