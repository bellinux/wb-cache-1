50|$|In the UK {{and in most}} of Europe, {{electric}} <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> did {{not become}} popular until the 1950s. This was {{largely because of the}} economic impact of World War II on the consumer market, which did not properly recover until the late 1950s. The early electric washers were single-tub, wringer-type <b>machines,</b> as fully <b>automatic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> were extremely expensive. During the 1960s, twin tub machines briefly became very popular, helped by the low price of the Rolls Razor washers. Some machines had the ability to pump used wash water into a separate tub for temporary storage, and to later pump it back for re-use. This was done not to save water or soap, but because heated water was expensive and time-consuming to produce. <b>Automatic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> did not become dominant in the UK until well into the 1970s and by then were almost exclusively of the front-loader design.|$|R
5000|$|Early <b>automatic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> {{were usually}} {{connected}} to a water supply via temporary slip-on connectors to sink taps. Later, permanent connections to both the hot and cold water supplies became the norm, as dedicated laundry water hookups became common. Most modern front-loading European machines now only have a cold water connection (called [...] "cold fill") and rely completely on internal electric heaters {{to raise the water}} temperature.|$|R
50|$|Since their introduction, <b>automatic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> {{have relied}} on {{electromechanical}} timers to sequence the washing and extraction process. Electromechanical timers consist {{of a series of}} cams on a common shaft driven by a small electric motor via a reduction gearbox. At the appropriate time in the wash cycle, each cam actuates a switch to engage or disengage a particular part of the machinery (for example, the drain pump motor).|$|R
50|$|Among {{applications}} are lighting (interior, exterior, and street lighting), cooking {{devices such as}} ovens, washing machines, and heating and cooling of buildings and vehicles. Built-in <b>automatic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> controllers are examples of very complex electromechanical and electronic timers cycles, starting and stopping many processes including pumps and valves to fill and empty the drum with water, heating, and rotating at different speeds, with different combinations of settings for different fabrics.|$|E
5000|$|What is now {{referred}} to as an automatic washer was at one time {{referred to}} as a [...] "washer/extractor", which combined the features of these two devices into a single machine, plus the ability to fill and drain water by itself. It is possible to take this a step further, and to also merge the <b>automatic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> and clothes dryer into a single device, called a combo washer dryer.|$|E
50|$|The Thor {{washing machine}} {{was the first}} {{electric}} clothes washer sold commercially in the United States. Produced by the Chicago-based Hurley Electric Laundry Equipment Company, the 1907 Thor {{is believed to be}} the first electrically powered washer ever manufactured, crediting Hurley as the inventor of the first <b>automatic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine.</b> Designed by Hurley engineer Alva J. Fisher, a patent for the new electric Thor was issued on August 9, 1910, three years after its initial invention.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} the Taguchi method and response surface analysis to minimize the proportion of defectives by oil contamination on one product of hard disk drive parts by using an <b>automatic</b> hydrocarbon <b>washing</b> <b>machine.</b> The experiments are conducted by using the Taguchi method and the matrices of washing conditions include nine parameters. The effect on the proportion of defectives by oil contamination is evaluated and determined. A second-order model is developed based on the parameters of the <b>automatic</b> hydrocarbon <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> and the proportion of defectives of oil contamination determined by using the response surface method. The experimental results show that the parameters are significant. The developed model can be used effectively to predict the response...|$|R
5000|$|Robert Hanks, also of The Independent, {{noted that}} the series [...] "looks lovely" [...] but perhaps [...] "a bit too lovely". While noting Gemma Arterton as [...] "gorgeous" [...] he found the acting [...] "mostly fair to middling" [...] with the {{exception}} of Anna Massey, whom he called [...] "quite brilliant" [...] in the role of Mrs D'Urberville. Hanks also bemoaned the lack of realism, noting that too many costume dramas today [...] "can’t afford to remind the viewer too explicitly just how grubby and laborious life was in the days before indoor hot running water, <b>automatic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> and biological powder".|$|R
50|$|Enriching uranium is {{difficult}} because the isotopes are practically identical in chemistry and very similar in weight: U-235 is only 1.26% lighter than U-238. Separation efficiency in a centrifuge depends on weight difference. Separation of uranium isotopes requires a centrifuge that can spin at 1,500 revolutions per second (90,000 RPM). If we assume a rotor diameter of 20 cm (actual rotor diameter {{is likely to be}} less), this corresponds to a linear speed of greater than Mach 2 (Mach 1 = 340 m/s). For comparison, <b>automatic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> operate at only about 12 to 25 revolutions per second (720-1500 RPM) during the spin cycle, while turbines in automotive turbochargers can run up to around 2500-3333 revolutions per second (150,000-200,000 RPM).|$|R

The aircraft was significant in that it included space for a secretary and stenography machine, as well as hook ups for up to 4 washing machines for demonstration purposes. The aircraft was nicknamed [...] "Smiling Thru" [...] and carried the registration of NC677K.|$|E
5000|$|A {{laundry room}} (also called a utility room) is {{a room where}} clothes are washed. In a modern home, a laundry room would be {{equipped}} with an <b>automatic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> and clothes dryer, and often a large basin, called a laundry tub, for hand-washing delicate articles of clothing such as sweaters, and an ironing board. A typical laundry room {{is located in the}} basement of older homes, but in many modern homes, the laundry room might be found on the main floor near the kitchen or upstairs near the bedrooms.|$|E
5000|$|Maslow's hammer, popularly phrased as [...] "" [...] and {{variants}} thereof, is from Abraham Maslow's The Psychology of Science, {{published in}} 1966. Abraham Maslow wrote: [...] "I remember seeing an elaborate and complicated <b>automatic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> for automobiles that did a beautiful job of washing them. But {{it could do}} only that, and everything else that got into its clutches was treated {{as if it were}} an automobile to be washed.

5000|$|There is {{dispute over}} {{who was the}} first {{inventor}} of the automatic washer. A company called Nineteen Hundred Washing Machine Company of Binghamton, NY claims to have produced the first electric washer in 1906; a year before Thor's release. [...] Additionally, it has been stated in various articles on the Internet that a Ford Motor Company employee invented the electric washer in late 19th century or early 20th century. Since Ford was incorporated in 1903, it seems unlikely that the Ford story is valid. Regardless, Thor remains one of the first (if not the first) company to manufacture and sell an <b>automatic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> on a large scale.|$|E
5000|$|A {{large number}} of US {{manufacturers}} introduced competing automatic machines (mainly of the top-loading type) in the late 1940s and early 1950s. An improved front-loading automatic model, the Bendix Deluxe (which retailed at $249.50/£162.40, $2687.04 in 2016 dollars), was introduced in 1947. General Electric also introduced its first top loading automatic model in 1947. This machine had many of the features that are incorporated into modern machines. Another early form of <b>automatic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> manufactured by The Hoover Company used cartridges to program different wash cycles. This system, called the [...] "Keymatic", used plastic cartridges with key-like slots and ridges around the edges. The cartridge was inserted into a slot on the machine and a mechanical reader operated the machine accordingly.|$|E
5000|$|Bendix Home Appliances, a {{subsidiary}} of Avco, an otherwise unrelated company, who licensed the name from Bendix Corporation, introduced the first domestic <b>automatic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> in 1937, having applied for a patent in the same year. In appearance and mechanical detail, this first machine was not unlike the front loading automatic washers produced today. Although it included many of the today's basic features, the machine lacked any drum suspension and therefore had to be anchored to the floor to prevent [...] "walking". Because of the components required, the machine was also very expensive. For instance, the Bendix Home Laundry Service Manual (published November 1, 1946) shows that the drum speed change was facilitated by a 2-speed gearbox built to a heavy duty standard (not unlike a car automatic gearbox, albeit at a smaller size). The timer was also probably fairly costly, because miniature electric motors were expensive to produce.|$|E
