50|$|Self-starting {{polyphase}} induction motors produce torque even at standstill. Available {{squirrel cage}} induction motor starting methods include direct-on-line starting, reduced-voltage reactor or <b>auto-transformer</b> <b>starting,</b> star-delta starting or, increasingly, new solid-state soft assemblies and, of course, VFDs.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison between}} the Direct-On-Line, Star-Delta and <b>Auto-transformer</b> induction motor <b>starting</b> method in terms of power quality. The purpose of this research is to identify the most reliable and practical starting method with fewer power quality problems. These three basic starting methods which differ in their respective starting methods in the industrial area for its economic reasons. This research was produced by analysing the existing power quality events during the Fluke Power Quality Analyser to capture the waveforms of the events. Hence, the most suitable and applicable starting method which causes the most suitable and applicable starting method which causes the least severe power quality event can be identified...|$|R
