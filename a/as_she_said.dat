25|$|Margaret Mitchell's novel Gone {{with the}} Wind (1936) also implies that Scarlett O'Hara {{should be the}} {{mistress}} of Rhett Butler, which was thought of as prostitution by O'Hara <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> she would be no better than Belle Watling.|$|E
25|$|It was {{announced}} on May 7, 2008, that Sunday night's episode on May 11, 2008, {{would be her}} last, opting to retire. Johanson ended the show very emotionally and was joined by her staff on stage <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> goodbye.|$|E
25|$|In November 2015, Windsor {{secretly}} filmed {{a return}} EastEnders, which {{was shown in}} January 2016. After this, {{it was confirmed that}} the character would be killed off later in the year. This was Windsor's decision, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that as long as Peggy was alive, she would always be drawn back to playing her. Her last appearance aired on BBC One on 17 May 2016.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They asked her,' said Noah, who, as he {{grew more}} wakeful, {{seemed to have a}} dawning {{perception}} who Sikes was, 'they asked her why she didn't come, last Sunday, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> promised. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> couldn't.' ...|$|R

25|$|In {{contrast}} to her linguistic abilities, Genie's nonverbal communication continued to excel. She invented her own system of gestures and pantomimed certain words <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> them, and also acted out events {{which she could}} not express in language. Initially she would only draw pictures if someone asked her to, but during her stay with the Riglers she began to use drawings to communicate if she could not explain something in words. In addition to her own drawings she often used pictures from magazines to relate to daily experiences, and for reasons the scientists never determined especially did so after encountering things that frightened her. Some time during mid-1972 Marilyn observed that a magazine picture of a wolf sent Genie into a terror, after which the Riglers asked Genie's mother if she knew a possible cause for this reaction; she then informed them {{that her husband had}} acted like a dog to intimidate Genie, making the underlying reason for her fear apparent to the scientists for the first time.|$|E
25|$|In episode 6, Dylan calls Brenda {{while she}} is talking to Kelly and Ryan. When Kelly finds out it's Dylan on the line, she talks to him. It turns out that Dylan wants {{to try to be}} a family again with her and Sammy. However, this would mean they would have to move away from Beverly Hills. After much thought, Kelly breaks up with Ryan, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that she needs to try to work things out with Dylan. Ryan asks Kelly why Dylan would call Brenda's phone, not hers, if he wanted to talk to Kelly. Fearing Brenda and Dylan were {{secretly}} back together, Kelly confronts Brenda. After hearing Brenda say that her and Dylan's relationship is platonic, Brenda and Kelly make up. Kelly decides to try to repair her relationship with Dylan, while Brenda sadly deletes his number from her cell phone. It is implied {{that there may have been}} more to the story of Brenda and Dylan's relationship that she didn't share with Kelly, as Brenda shed some tears when deleting Dylan's phone number.|$|E
25|$|When Subaru faces Fūma in battle, {{he allows}} the Dragon of Earth to blind {{him in his}} right eye—a lesser wish Subaru had held for some time. In single combat against Seishirō at Rainbow Bridge, Subaru reveals his true desire: he wishes to be killed by him, as thus he would exist in Seishirō's heart. However, due to a spell cast by Hokuto at her death, the killing strike is reversed, and Subaru kills Seishirō instead. Hokuto has told Seishiro this spell cast when Seishiro killed her <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> she has the last {{confidence}} for him because 'Subaru loves him'. This implied that Sheshiro is willing to kill himself by Subaru as he thought this is Subaru's real hope. As a result of Seishirō's death, Subaru loses his will to fight alongside his ability to create a barrier which causes {{him to leave the}} Dragons of Heaven. Fūma brings him Seishiro's eye which is necessary to grant the assassin's wish: erasing Fūma's mark in Subaru by replacing Subaru's wounded eye. Subaru accepts the eye, inheriting his powers and the Sakurazukamori title in the process and becoming one of the Dragons of Earth. Despite joining Fūma, Subaru is still interested in Kamui's true wish.|$|E

500|$|Hill met {{her partner}} as of 2004, chef Brad Lynch, on a {{climbing}} trip in Moab, Utah, {{and at the}} age of 42, she gave birth to a son. Hill has spoken frequently about how having a child lessened the amount of time she had for climbing but not her love for it. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> in one interview, [...] "I feel that right now, it doesn't have to be all about me and my experiences. I was ready to begin a new role; to face new challenges and adventures as a mother. It's a good learning experience adjusting to the sacrifices that need to be made." ...|$|E
500|$|This was a tour {{de force}} for sure– but an indulgent one. It didn’t unlock {{anything}} substantially new to Dot. [...] Far from making us care more about Dot– we do anyway, it was preaching to the converted– it was a little, well, dull. Boring even. [...] he episode revealed a nagging weakness: Coronation Street has a fine repertory of older characters and actors which gives the show its wonderful link to the past. In EastEnders, the same gatekeeping roles are played by Dot and Ian Beale: she is a jewel but, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> an all-too lonely one. Cherish her, absolutely, but don’t turn her into a drag act.|$|E

500|$|Warren {{spoke at}} the 2012 Democratic National Convention {{immediately}} before Bill Clinton on the penultimate night of the convention. Warren contrasted President Obama's economic plan with Mitt Romney's in the 2012 election and rebuked the Republican Party's economic policy stating: [...] "Their vision is clear: 'I've got mine, {{and the rest of}} you are on your own.'" [...] Warren positioned herself as a champion of a beleaguered middle class that, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "has been chipped, squeezed and hammered." [...] Brown attended the 2012 Republican National Convention, but was not a speaker there. According to Brown, he had rejected an offer to play a larger role, and limited his attendance to a single day because of scheduling demands.|$|E
500|$|Melua {{opened up}} about the {{breakdown}} years later {{in an interview with}} The Independent, saying that it ended up being {{one of the best things}} that had ever happened to her, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> it helped to squash a feeling of superiority she felt by being a successful musician in the music industry. [...] "....It was petrifying, but it put a stop to fantasies of being able to do anything. The oddest thing about this job is the sense of superiority you get. It was a huge wake-up call. I was completely out of it for two weeks, and in hospital for six. There was a bunch of things going on, things at home and crazy work schedules, and you really believe the world revolved around you and it doesn’t." ...|$|E
500|$|When Will ridicules Sue's fashion sense, Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Mercedes (Amber Riley) {{give her}} a makeover, recreating Madonna's [...] "Vogue" [...] video. Guidance {{counsellor}} Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) is inspired by Madonna's example, and tells Will that she intends to lose her virginity to him that evening. Santana (Naya Rivera) offers to take Finn's virginity, and Rachel and her boyfriend Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff) also decide to have sex, leading to a dream performance of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] between all three couples. Ultimately, Emma and Rachel do not go through with it, but Finn does have sex with Santana. He later hides this from Rachel, having concluded that the sex was meaningless, and that he truly regretted it, in contrasted with Rachel, who despite not going through with it, claims she did <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> {{and it was no}} big deal.|$|E
6000|$|This time also, <b>as</b> before, <b>she</b> {{borrowed}} a brush and brushed {{her hair with}} it, and the gold dropped down <b>as</b> <b>she</b> did it; and again she sent the dog out three times, and when day dawned <b>she</b> departed, but <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was going <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> before, 'I shall come once more, and then never again.' ...|$|R

500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, {{the lyrics of}} [...] "Express Yourself" [...] make it a simple love song, with Madonna exhorting the women in her {{audience}} not to go for second-best, to express their feelings and get their men to express theirs. Lucy O'Brien, author of Madonna: Like an Icon, described them as a [...] "feminist call-to-arms", with Madonna dismissing the satin sheets and gold baubles of material pleasures. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> in the interview with Rolling Stone, [...] "the lyrics are my way of saying if it doesn't work, then you're better off on your own. Quite possibly there were some personal feelings mixed in the lyrics as well." [...] Subtexts are employed throughout the song, especially in the line [...] "What {{you need is a}} big strong hand, to lift you to your higher ground", where the [...] "big strong hand" [...] is implied as one's own hand, and not the typical male helping hand.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010 Smith {{performed}} at various festivals and events. Her father stated that [...] "because she is still so young, we don't want her doing complete shows on her own and we don't want her doing too much." [...] Appearances included the Mercedes-Benz World Summer Concert in Weybridge on 4 July, That Glorious Noise charity concert in aid of muscular dystrophy in Cleethorpes on 17 July and the Last Night of the Kenwood Proms on 21 August, {{as well as the}} wedding of Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford. Smith also opened the Serenata festival. Angela Young, reviewing the festival for the Bournemouth Daily Echo, said [...] "Faryl Smith was my personal highlight of the Thursday night line-up, her bizarrely powerful voice (considering her diminutive size and age) taking my breath away and it contrasted so well with her naivete <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> 'at least it's not raining' – just as the heavens opened." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Do Somethin'" [...] was filmed in December 2004 in Los Angeles, California. It was co-directed by Spears and Billie Woodruff, who {{previously}} {{worked with her}} in [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] and in [...] "Overprotected". Spears described the shoot as [...] "hectic", adding it was filmed [...] "in a record-breaking five hours". She also commented about co-directing with Woodruff, saying that [...] "he had no ego whatsoever, and the whole process was just so much fun". Spears is credited as [...] "Mona Lisa" [...] in the video, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I kinda think she's like my alter ego whenever I feel like being mean or possibly like bustin' people around to get stuff right... It's kinda easier to be called 'Mona Lisa' instead of Britney". The video was also choreographed and styled entirely by Spears, with clothing from Juicy Couture. Spears ultimately added that working behind the camera inspired her to become a director in the future, explaining, [...] "After doing about 20 videos, it gets kind of boring playing the same role. I feel like being behind the camera is sometimes more satisfying than being in front of it".|$|E

500|$|The {{hearing before}} {{a panel of}} six judges on 16 April 1860 was {{attended}} by neither the Mortara family nor Feletti—the former {{because they were in}} Turin and learned of the trial date only two days beforehand, and the latter because he refused to recognise the new authorities' right to put him on trial. With the evidence gathered by Curletti and Carboni already in hand, the prosecution had no witnesses to call. The prosecutor Radamisto Valentini, a lawyer fighting his first major case, declared that Feletti had ordered the seizure alone and on his own initiative, and then turned his focus to Carboni's second point of how the authorities in Rome could have possibly concluded that Morisi's story was genuine. Valentini went over Morisi's account in detail, arguing that even if things had happened <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> the baptism had not been administered properly and was therefore invalid. He then highlighted the inconsistencies between her testimony and the other accounts, condemned Morisi as a silly girl [...] "corrupted by the foul breath and touch of foreign soldiers... rolled over without shame with them", and finally charged that Feletti had ordered the seizure himself out of megalomania and [...] "an inquisitor's hatred of Judaism".|$|E
500|$|Rowling {{was born}} to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce {{aircraft}} engineer, and Anne Rowling (née Volant), a science technician, on 31 July 1965 in Yate, [...] Gloucestershire, England, [...] northeast of Bristol. Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964. They married on 14 March 1965. One of her maternal great-grandfathers, Dugald Campbell, was Scottish, born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was French, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during the First World War. Rowling originally believed he had won the Légion d'honneur during the war, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> when she received it herself in 2009. She later discovered the truth when featured in an episode of the UK genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are?, in which she {{found out it was}} a different Louis Volant who won the Legion of Honour. When she heard his story of bravery and discovered the croix de guerre was for [...] "ordinary" [...] soldiers like her grandfather, who had been a waiter, she stated the croix de guerre was [...] "better" [...] to her than the Legion of Honour.|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{describes}} her writing process as regimented. [...] Beginning with Caged Bird, she {{has used the}} same [...] "writing ritual" [...] for many years. She gets up at {{five in the morning}} and checks into a hotel room, where the staff has been instructed to remove any pictures from the walls. [...] She writes on legal pads while lying on the bed, with a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, Roget's Thesaurus, and the Bible, and leaves by the early afternoon. [...] She averages 10–12 pages of material a day, which she edits down to three or four pages in the evening. [...] Angelou goes through this process to [...] "enchant" [...] herself, and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> in a 1989 interview with the BBC, to [...] "relive the agony, the anguish, the Sturm und Drang". She places herself back in the time she is writing about, even during traumatic experiences like her rape in Caged Bird, to [...] "tell the human truth" [...] about her life. [...] Angelou has stated that she plays cards to reach that place of enchantment, to access her memories more effectively. She has stated, [...] "It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it—ha! It's so delicious!" [...] She does not find the process cathartic; rather, she has found relief in [...] "telling the truth".|$|E
