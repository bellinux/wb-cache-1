50|$|A {{try square}} is a {{woodworking}} or a metalworking tool used for marking and measuring {{a piece of}} wood. The square refers to the tool's primary use of measuring the accuracy of a right angle (90 degrees); to try a surface is to check its straightness or correspondence to an <b>adjoining</b> <b>surface.</b> A piece of wood that is rectangular, flat, and has all edges (faces, sides, and ends) 90 degrees is called four square. A board is often milled four square in preparation for using it in building furniture.|$|E

This friction device includes a “shoe” that rubs against an <b>adjoining</b> <b>surface</b> during normal pedal operation. Due to the materials used, wear and environmental conditions, these surfaces may, over time, begin to stick and release instead of operating smoothly.

50|$|A {{trench drain}} (also channel drain, line drain, slot drain, linear drain or strip drain) is a {{specific}} type of floor drain containing a dominant trough- or channel-shaped body. It is used for the rapid evacuation of surface water or for the containment of utility lines or chemical spills. Employing a solid cover or grating that is flush with the <b>adjoining</b> <b>surface,</b> this drain is commonly made of concrete in-situ and may utilize polymer- or metal-based liners or a channel former to aid in channel crafting and slope formation. Characterized by its long length and narrow width, the cross-section of the drain {{is a function of the}} maximum flow volume anticipated from the surrounding surface. Channels can range from 1 in to 2 feet in width, with depths that can reach 4 ft.|$|E
40|$|There is {{a variety}} of {{objectives}} for measuring deviations of flatness, size and mutual arrangement of flat surfaces, namely: processing accuracy control, machinery condition monitoring, treatment process control in terms of shape deviation, comparative analysis of machine rigidity. If for a processing accuracy control it is sufficient to obtain the flatness deviation, as the maximum <b>adjoining</b> <b>surface</b> deviation, {{the choice of the}} <b>adjoining</b> <b>surface</b> as a zero reference datum deviation leads to considerable difficulties in creating devices and in particular devices for measuring size and shape variations. The flat surface is characterized by mutual arrangement of its points and can be represented by equation in the selected coordinate system. The objective of this work is to provide analytical construction of the vector field F, which describes the real surface with an appropriate approximation upon modelling the face milling of the flat surfaces of body parts in conditions of anisotropic rigidity of technological system. To determine the numerical value of shape and size deviation characteristics the average surfaces can serve a basis for the zero reference values of vectors. A mean value theorem allows to obtain measurement information about deviations in shape, size and arrangement of processed flat surfaces in terms of metrology, as well as about the process parameters such as depth of cut, feed, cutting speed, anisotropic rigidity of technological system that characterize the specific processing conditions. The machining center MS 12 - 250 was used to carry out a number of experiments with processing the surfaces of the prism-shaped body parts (300 x 300 x 250) and the subsequent measurements of flatness on the IS- 49 optical line to prove the correlation between expected and observed values of the vectors of flatness deviations...|$|E

In this study, we present a technique for measuring such forces, using an AFM cantilever attached with a porous gamma alumina nanoparticle aggregate.

A strong force of attraction was observed between the aggregate and hydrophilic surfaces when the aggregate was kept dry. However, the force of interaction on the aggregate in wet form (water filled in pores) was larger when the <b>adjoining</b> <b>surface</b> had hydrophobic characteristics. The results presented in this study show the versatility of the current technique and indicate its usefulness in directly characterizing hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties of nano-scale surfaces and patterns.

30|$|A further {{driver of}} the growing {{complexity}} of environmental risk assessment for PPPs lies in the EU Regulation on Plant Protection Products. In {{the event of a}} negative assessment result at a lower assessment tier based on standard data and conservative assumptions, the applicant can use a so-called “refined assessment” to show that no unacceptable environmental impacts of a PPP are to be expected under realistic application conditions. The investment in such a refinement of the risk assessment, e.g., in the form of mathematical models or more complex experimental studies (aquatic mesocosms, and field studies) is usually worthwhile for the applicant company. This is either because {{it is the only way}} to obtain an authorisation or because it makes it possible to avoid stricter requirements for risk management (e.g., concerning margins to <b>adjoining</b> <b>surface</b> water bodies). Refined risk assessment for environmentally critical but heatedly justified PPPs in particular is becoming increasingly complex.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} solid waste {{disposal}} at Egbe area of Ijebu-igbo, southwestern Nigeria on the <b>adjoining</b> <b>surface</b> and groundwater sources has been investigated. The Basement rocks in the area include Precambrian Migmatite gneiss complex, Older granite that have been extensively weathered. In the study area, the geophysical survey involved three (3) electrical imaging line while the hydro chemical database comprised two samples of hand-dug wells and one sample of surface water. The result of {{the interpretation of the}} electrical imaging lines shows the thickness of the dumpsite to be shallow at about 5 m with low apparent resistivity varying from 10 - 30 ohm-m, 65 - 85 ohm-m in the northwestern and southeastern part:; of traverse 1 and 10 - 30 ohm-m on the north western part of traverse 2. The apparent resistivity increase with depth and this shows that the leachates of the dumpsite indicated by low apparent resistivity is not likely to affect the aquifer system {{because of the presence of}} the lateritic cap in the subsurface. The third traverse, which serves as the control, has high apparent resistivity and this indicates absence of leachates but weathered basement. Result of chemical analysis carried out on the water samples show that the surface and groundwater at the vicinity of the dumpsite has not been polluted and this is likely due to the shallow depth or thickness of the dumpsite. In conclusion, the proposed housing estate in the study area can still go on without fear of water pollution by the presence of the abandoned dumpsit...|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} the quality and {{quantity}} of the groundwater resources from hand-dug wells, within two of these slums—Anoumabo (Marcory) and Adjouffou (Port-Bouet), both located in the southern part of the city. Twenty-eight representative groundwater samples were collected from different domestic wells within the study area. In addition, water samples were collected from the <b>adjoining</b> <b>surface</b> water bodies—the ébrié lagoon and the Atlantic Ocean. The water samples were also tested for microbial indicators of fecal contamination using the conventional membrane filtration method. The groundwater samples are alkaline to acidic with pH ranging between 4. 4 and 8. 1. They are slightly mineralized with electrical conductivity, EC values ranging between 388 μ S/cm and 1494 μ S/cm. The dominant hydrochemical facies are Na-Cl, Na-SO 4, Ca-Cl and Ca-SO 4. Although, majority of the water samples have anions and cations concentrations conforming to the World Health Organi z ation, alerting levels of nitrate contamination was recorded in the area. About 67 percent of the tested samples have nitrate values greater than the recommended WHO limit for drinking water (NO 3 > 50 mg/ι). Exceeding high nitrate concentrations in drinking water have been medically proven to be detrimental to infant health. Microbial analyses reveal bacterial contamination at varying degrees in all of the water wells. The presence of these microbial organisms in the samples is also indicative of the presence of some other disease causing pathogens, responsible for sicknesses like cholera, diarrhea, typhoid, etc. The water wells located within Anoumabo have relatively higher levels of groundwater contaminants in comparison to those located within Adjouffou. This is obviously due to the poor well designs and prevalent unhygienic and poor sanitary habits of its inhabitants. These waters though completely unsuitable for drinking and domestic purposes, can be used for irrigation purposes with very little or no sodium problems. </p...|$|E

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that visual {{perception}} of the take-off board and the subsequent regulation of the approach run occur 4 - 5 strides prior to take-off. Contrast in visual perception {{is determined by the}} difference in colour and occurs when a surface of one colour induces its antagonist colour in an <b>adjoining</b> <b>surface.</b> The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate if colour contrast between the track surface and the board affects the stride regulation pattern at the long jump approach run. Four long jumpers performed long jumps in two different occasions: 6 from a runway track coloured blue, with a white take-off board and 6 from a modified yellow board. The runway was marked and the approach runs were recorded with a panning camera. Toe- board distance (TBD) for each support phase in every run-up and the percentage distribution of adjustment of the regulated strides was calculated. With the white take-off board, the average TBD variability reached its peak value (21. 74 cm) on the 5 th stride from the board and at a distance of 9. 77 m from take-off point. With the yellow take-off board the average TBD variability culminated (24. 80 cm) on the 7 th stride from the board and at a distance of 13. 40 m from take-off point. With the white board, 80 % of the adjustment was distributed during the last two strides as opposed to 61 % with the yellow board. When a take-off board of a colour complementary to the runway’s blue track surface is used, athletes initiated their regulation 2 strides earlier. This may be attributed to an enhanced visual perception of the approaching target allowing a more uniform distribution of adjustments during the last two strides of the approach...|$|E

Circular fin is installed around each circular layer of Thermoelectric Materials (TEM) after the water jacket. The heat loss through each fin is calculated as 24 W. Energy balance is done at each and every TEM and correspondingly calculated the amount of power transferred through each segment of TEG as 32 W. We have calculated the length of TEM sample for attaining the respective temperature range for the hybrid of Bi_ 2 Te_ 3 and TiO_ 1. 1. This calculation is done by considering the compatibility factor derived as s =√(1 + ZT) - 1 /α T which is a ratio of current density to conduction heat flux. The length obtained for this particular combination is ∼ 8 mm. To this end, we have reported the efficiency with respect to mass flow rate of hot flue gas from the automobile for different layers of TEG for the above-mentioned combination.

The new method is consistent {{in the sense that it}} recovers exactly global polynomial solutions that are in the finite element space.
