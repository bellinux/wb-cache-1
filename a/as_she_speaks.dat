Angela Petrelli watches a television news report about her son's attack <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>speaks</b> to an unidentified person on the phone. She calmly and firmly states that she understands the reason for the attack on Nathan, but that the assassination attempt has [...] "opened Pandora's box".|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{charities}} {{formed around}} White's death. The Indiana University Dance Marathon, started in 1991, raises {{money for the}} Riley Hospital for Children. Between 1991 and 2016, this event helped raise over $28 million for children at Riley. The money raised has also helped found the Ryan White Infectious Disease Clinic at the hospital {{to take care of}} the nation's sickest children. Ryan's personal physician, with whom he was close friends, Dr. Martin Kleiman, became the Ryan White Professor of Pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis. In a 1993 interview, prominent gay rights and AIDS activist Larry Kramer said, [...] "I think little Ryan White probably did more to change the face of this illness and to move people than anyone. And he continues to be a presence through his mom, Jeanne White. She has an incredibly moving presence <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>speaks</b> around the world." ...|$|E

500|$|The clips {{differ from}} one another in terms of Lennon's attire {{and the nature of}} Ono's role as, in author Robert Rodriguez's description, [...] "an onstage focal point around which all {{activity}} was staged"; in addition, Lennon's vocal was treated with echo for the 19 February broadcast. In the [...] "knitting" [...] clip, Lennon is wearing a black polo-neck jumper as Ono sits beside his piano, blindfolded, and knitting throughout. In [...] "cue card", Lennon wears a flower-pattern shirt under a denim jacket, while Ono holds up a series of cryptically worded cue cards, the messages on which include [...] "Smile", [...] "Hope" [...] and [...] "Peace", <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>speaks</b> into a microphone. Although Ono appears to have a more active role, she is again blindfolded and the words she speaks cannot be heard. Rodriguez describes both clips as [...] "terrifically engaging, providing suitably dynamic visuals to a powerful song", yet he considers that the [...] "cue card" [...] performance [...] "captures much more of the ambience, with frequent shots of White's stellar work and the studio dancers".|$|E
2500|$|The novel {{begins with}} the {{introduction}} of three of the characters – Aleksandra, Lezhnev, and Pandalevskii. Pandalevskii relates to Aleksandra Dar’ya Mikhailovna’s invitation to come and meet a Baron Muffel’. Instead of the Baron, Rudin arrives and captivates everyone immediately with his intelligent and witty speeches during the argument with Pigasov. Interestingly, Rudin’s arrival is delayed until Chapter Three. After his success at Dar’ya Mikhailovna’s, he stays the night and the next morning meets Lezhnev who arrives to discuss some business affairs with Dar’ya Mikhailovna. This is the first time the reader finds out that Rudin and Lezhnev are acquainted, and studied together at university. During the day that follows Rudin has his first conversation with Natasha; <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>speaks</b> of him highly and says he “ought to work”, he replies with a lengthy speech. What follows is a description quite typical of Turgenev, where the character of Rudin is shown not through his own words, but through the text which underlines Rudin’s contradictory statements: ...|$|E

60|$|Verena {{said this}} with the same eagerness, with as {{determined}} an air of not incurring any reproach this time. But <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had <b>spoken</b> <b>she</b> buried her head in Olive's lap.|$|R

(She licks the envelope.) It's enough to drive anyone out of their SENSES (thumping the envelope to make it stick) to hear a perfectly commonplace woman raved about in that absurd manner merely because she's got good hair, and a tolerable figure.|$|E
6000|$|<b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>speaks,</b> {{the door}} Left Forward is opened and old MR JACOB [...] TWISDEN comes in.

6000|$|... "Another thing must {{be taken}} into {{consideration}} too--Mrs. Elton does not talk to Miss Fairfax <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>speaks</b> of her. We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest spoken amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other--a something more early implanted. We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before. We feel things differently. And besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to. Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton's way before--and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if not in consciousness." ...|$|E
60|$|Madame Belloc was the {{translator}} of Maria Edgeworth by that lady's desire; corresponded {{with her for}} years, and still has many of her letters. Her translation of Uncle Tom has {{to me all the}} merit and all the interest of an original composition. In perusing it I enjoy the pleasure of reading the story with scarce any consciousness of its ever having been mine. In the evening Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Hall called. They are admirably matched--he artist, she author. The one writes stories, the other illustrates them. Madame M. also called. English by birth, she is a true Parisienne, or, rather, seems to have both minds, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>speaks</b> both languages, perfectly. Her husband being a learned Oriental scholar, she, like some other women enjoying similar privileges, has picked up a deal of information, which she tosses about in conversation, in a gay, piquant manner, much as a kitten plays with a pin ball.|$|E
