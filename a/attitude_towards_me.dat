40|$|To {{explore and}} {{understand}} participants' perceptions and <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> {{the reporting of}} medication errors (MEs). A qualitative study using in-depth interviews of 31 healthcare practitioners from nine publicly funded, primary care clinics in three states in peninsular Malaysia was conducted for this study. The participants included family medicine specialists, doctors, pharmacists, pharmacist assistants, nurses and assistant medical officers. The interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Analysis of the data was guided by the framework approach. Six themes and 28 codes were identified. Despite {{the availability of a}} reporting system, most of the participants agreed that MEs were underreported. The nature of the error {{plays an important role in}} determining the reporting. The reporting system, organisational factors, provider factors, reporter's burden and benefit of reporting also were identified. Healthcare practitioners in primary care clinics understood the importance of reporting MEs to improve patient safety. Their perceptions and <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> reporting of <b>MEs</b> were influenced by many factors which affect the decision-making process of whether or not to report. Although the process is complex, it primarily is determined by the severity of the outcome of the errors. The participants voluntarily report the errors if they are familiar with the reporting system, what error to report, when to report and what form to use...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to measure the attitudes, {{socio-economic}} status, and achievement of Inuit students and to determine the relationship among these three variables. [...] To obtain the necessary information utilized in the analysis of the questions posed in the study, a questionnaire was administered to sixty-seven Inuit students enrolled in the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades in two all-grade schools in the isolated, coastal region of Northern Labrador. The first section of the questionnaire elicited background information concerning the socio-economic indicators, parental education, parental occupation, family size, and family possessions. The final section of the questionnaire utilized an attitudinal scale, the semantic differential, to measure the students' <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> self (<b>ME)</b> and education (SCHOOL, BOOKS, ENGLISH, TEACHER, DISCIPLINE, EXAMINATION, READING, HOMEWORK, STUDYING, and LEARNING). <b>Attitude</b> <b>towards</b> education was also measured by a question directed at the students' expectation of the grade level to be achieved. A basic data sheet recorded from the students' report cards an indication of actual school achievement, the students' total grade average and subjects failed for first two school terms. [...] The main findings of the study indicate that, while socio-economic status and achievement of Inuit students are low, their attitudes are not negative. The findings also indicate that, of the variables investigated, only the indicators of socio-economic status are significantly related to the indicators of school achievement. Father's education, father's occupation, and mother's occupation are significantly related to the students' total grade average, and father's occupation is significantly related to subjects failed. [...] The study concludes that socio-economic status, not negative attitudes, is the major obstacle to educational achievement among the Inuit students in Labrador. It also concludes that the Inuit student appears to have made only tentative and weak commitments to the values of the educational system and the "White culture" it represents...|$|R

2500|$|According to the Kebra Nagast of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Pharaoh's {{daughter}} tricked Solomon into committing idolatry {{by making}} him swear an oath. In the text {{she was upset}} that he has slept with the Queen of Sheba and fathered Menyelek (who is held to have taken the Arc of the Covenant with him when the Queen returned with him to Africa). Solomon at first resists her calls saying [...] "I will neither sacrifice to nor worship thine idols, and I will not perform thy wish." [...] So [...] "one day she beautified and scented herself for him, and she behaved herself haughtily towards him, and treated him disdainfully. And he said unto her, [...] "What shall I do? Thou hast made thy face evil <b>towards</b> <b>me,</b> and thy regard <b>towards</b> <b>me</b> is not as it was formerly, and thy beautiful form is not as enticing as usual. Ask me, and I will give thee whatsoever thou wishest, and I will perform it for thee, so that thou mayest make thy face (or, <b>attitude)</b> gracious <b>towards</b> <b>me</b> as formerly"; but she held her peace and answered him never a word. And he repeated to her the words {{that he would do}} whatsoever she wished, and she said unto him, [...] "Swear to me by the God of Israel that thou wilt not play me false." [...] And he swore to her that he would give her whatsoever she asked for, and that he would do for her everything that she told him. And she tied a scarlet thread on the middle of the door of [...] her gods, and she brought three locusts and set them in the house of her gods. And she said unto Solomon, [...] "Come to me without breaking the scarlet thread, bend thyself and kill these locusts before me and pull out their necks"; and he did so. And she said unto him, [...] "I will henceforward do thy will, for thou hast sacrificed to my gods and hast worshipped them." [...] Now he had done thus because of his oath, so that he might not break his oath which she had made him to swear, even though he knew that it was an offence (or, sin) to enter into the house of her gods." ...|$|R

40|$|Green food is {{perceived}} by Chinese consumers as environmentally friendly and safe to consume. Through a hierarchical values-attitudes model, the paper examines {{the degree to}} which <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> green food is determined by consumers’ values and their general <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> environment and nature and technological progress. The link between collectivism, <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> environment and nature, and <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> green food is the strongest link of the hierarchical model. However, collectivism also influences <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> technological progress, which in turn influence <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> green food. This finding, coupled with the lack of significant relationship between individualism and <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> technological progress point towards the conclusion that the belief of Chinese people that technology is a positive determinant of food safety and environmental friendliness in food production steams from altruistic predispositions, which in turn influence (positively) Chinese consumers’ <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> technology.
