40|$|The {{width of}} an <b>address</b> <b>electrode</b> is an {{important}} parameter to affect both the address and sustain discharge characteristics in AC-PDP. It is found numerically that as the width of an <b>address</b> <b>electrode</b> is wider, the capacitance between the sustain and address electrodes (CAY) increases but the capacitance between the two sustain electrodes (CXY) decreases. The resultant changes in the sustain and address discharge characteristics, such as a firing voltage, sustain voltage, discharge delay time and full-white luminance were examined in the 50 -in. ac-PDP with a high Xe (> 10 %) content. The increase in the <b>address</b> <b>electrode</b> width causes {{an increase in the}} firing and sustain voltage between the sustain electrodes, which are due to the decrease in the capacitance between two sustain electrodes and the increase in the wall charges accumulation toward the <b>address</b> <b>electrode.</b> In particular, the full-white luminance increases with an increase in the <b>address</b> <b>electrode</b> width. As the <b>address</b> <b>electrode</b> width becomes broaden, the sustain discharge path is lengthened toward the <b>address</b> <b>electrode</b> and the discharge volume is also enlarged. Therefore, the amount of the IR, VUV and Ne rays can be emitted considerably. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{large-scale}} {{integration of}} analog operable MEMS micro-mirrors onto active CMOS address circuitry requires high quality planar reflective optical surfaces {{but also a}} stable deflection vs. voltage characteristic. However, for implementing a CMOS compatible surface micromachining process, certain obstacles like a restricted thermal budget and a limited selection of suitable materials must be overcome. In this paper, amorphous TiAl {{is presented as a}} new actuator material for monolithical MEMS integration onto CMOS circuitry at room temperature. Sputter deposited TiAl has an x-ray amorphous structure and a low stress gradient. The missing long range order and the high melting point help to virtually eliminate stress relaxation effects, i. e.

As an alternative, we study a device with narrow metallic electrodes in combination with dielectric layers with large dielectric permittivity. In this approach the applied voltage can be a continuous function of the lateral distance from the electrode line. Simulations for a one-dimensional beam-steering device show that the switching of the liquid crystal (LC) director depends indeed on the distance from the <b>addressing</b> <b>electrodes</b> and on the value of the relative permittivity. We show that in a device with electrodes spaced 60 μm apart, the LC director halfway between the electrodes shows a considerable reorientation, when a dielectric layer with permittivity of r = 550 is used, whereas no reorientation is observed for the uncoated reference sample at the same voltage. An added advantage is that the proposed configuration only contains dielectric materials, without resistive losses, which means that almost no heat is dissipated. This indicates that this technology could be used in low-power LC devices.

Chitosan possesses a unique combination of properties to meet these challenges and serve as an effective bio-device interface material.

In order to make SOFC technology cost competitive with existing technologies, the operating temperatures have been decreased to the range where costly ceramic components may be substituted with inexpensive metal components within the cell and stack design. However, a number of issues have arisen due to this decrease in temperature: decreased electrolyte ionic conductivity, cathode reaction rate limitations, and a decrease in anode contaminant tolerance. While the decrease in electrolyte ionic conductivities has been countered by decreasing the electrolyte thickness, the electrode limitations have remained a more difficult problem. Nanostructuring SOFC <b>electrodes</b> <b>addresses</b> the major <b>electrode</b> issues.

40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: The primary {{objective}} of this thesis {{is the development of}} non-cooled deformable unimorph mirrors (DM) for thermal lensing compensation in high-power laser systems. The secondary objective is the development of a manufacturing regime that consists mainly of batch-fabrication and reduced manual processes. The DM consists of a mirror substrate with a piezoelectric layer sandwiched between two electrodes, bonded on the mirror’s rear surface. These types of mirror have been successfully integrated into high-power laser systems; however, further increase in laser power requires new thermal compensation techniques in which the DMs performance is not affected by temperature changes in the mirror assembly. To achieve this objective, a multi-layer design was studied. The multi-layer design integrates several layers with thermo-mechanical parameters that differ from the substrate and the active layer into the mirror set-up. Beginning with this set-up, an optimization is performed with regard to the required large piezoelectric stroke and low thermally-induced deflection by analytical and finite element modelling. The thermally-induced deflection of the multi-layer is distinguished by their source into homogeneous thermal loading and inhomogeneous laser loading. The mirror response upon piezoelectric activation and both thermal loadings was simulated with respect to piezoelectric layer discontinuity, different mechanical boundary conditions, reflective copper-layer thickness, and mirror mount materials. The manufacturing regime of screen-printed piezoelectric DM is developed. The manufacturing process comprises six steps out of which five are batch-fabrication techniques. The mirror surface finishing by means of an ultraprecise turning process alone does not involve batch fabrication. In contrast to state-of-the-art deformable mirror technologies, the electric wiring of the <b>addressing</b> <b>electrodes</b> of the deformable mirror is also batch-fabricated and the mirror set-up is monolithic. The thesis presents possible concepts to compensate for thermally-induced mirror deformation. Thermally-induced deformation by homogeneous loading is balanced by the zero deflection configuration of the multi-layer. The compensation for laser-induced deformation can be achieved by homogeneous thermal loading that can compensate as the deformation caused by the loading opposes the laser-induced deformation. This approach is referred to as compound loading, and it is investigated in a practical mirror set-up. Here, a 1. 3 -W absorbed laser power is compensated by a 34 -K homogeneous loading. It is concluded that the developed and mainly batch-fabricated DM are suitable for high-power laser applications...|$|R
40|$|Electroanalytical {{chemistry}} {{has been}} widely developed and applied {{to the study of}} neurochemical systems. This then leads {{to a better understanding of}} many aspects of neurotransmission, for example, neural circuitry and neural substrates of compulsive drug use. This feasibility partly stems from the ease of oxidative detection of many neurotransmitters including dopamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, glutamic acid and γ–aminobutyric acid. At the same time, this has also stimulated the development of structurally small electrodes for applications to the detection of neurotransmitters in biological microenvironments. In this respect, the small dimension of such electrodes permits minimal tissue damage upon implantation and, of equal importance, permits very careful selection of the region of tissue where measurements can be performed. In addition, the inherent fast response time of structurally small electrodes makes it feasible to follow biochemical events frequently taking place on a millisecond time scale (e. g. neuronal firing). Various electrode materials used to construct structurally small electrodes of different geometries and sizes have hitherto been reported. Common electrode materials both modified and otherwise, include metals such as tungsten and aluminium, gold nanoparticledeposited aluminium, various forms of carbon e. g. doped diamond, nanocrystalline diamond, pyrolysed carbon, carbon fibres, and gold nanoparticles deposited onto glassy carbon. A common problem encountered while performing in vivo electrochemical analyses of neurotransmitters is the adsorption of lipids, peptides and high molecular weight proteins present in biological matrices on the electrode surface. Formation of these layers leads to electrode fouling which distorts the voltammetric signal and suppresses the sensitivity of the electrode. Considerable research effort has been devoted to <b>addressing</b> <b>electrode</b> fouling problems. Approaches ranging from fast scan voltammetry, immobilising a protective organic film on the electrode surface, completely altering the surface termination, fabrication of nanocrystalline diamond coated electrodes, or of doped diamond electrodes, to gold electrodes modified with gold nanorod and gold nanoparticles have been developed. Apart from overcoming fouling, the latter methods have also demonstrated other advantages such as wider potential windows, greater durability, increased robustness and enhanced sensitivity. In this paper, we aim to thoroughly review the techniques used in developing structurally small electrodes of different geometries, which were then applied to the detection of neurotransmitters. We will also pay special emphasis on the strategies used to minimize electrode fouling during electrochemical detection of neurotransmitters at these electrodes. A comparison of these methods and possible future directions in the development of structurally small electrodes for detection of neurotransmitters will conclude the review. ...|$|R

The CI systems were bilaterally programmed either with the fine structure processing strategy FS 4 or with the constant rate strategy high definition continuous interleaved sampling (HDCIS). Familiarization periods between 6 and 12 weeks were considered. The effect of IPD was measured in two types of experiments: (a) IPD detection thresholds with tonal signals addressing mainly one apical interaural electrode pair and (b) with speech in noise in terms of binaural speech intelligibility level differences (BILD) <b>addressing</b> multiple <b>electrodes</b> bilaterally. The results in (a) showed improved IPD detection thresholds with FS 4 compared with HDCIS in four out of the seven BiCI users. In contrast, 12 BiCI users in (b) showed similar BILD with FS 4 (0. 6 [*]±[*] 1. 9 [*]dB) and HDCIS (0. 5 [*]±[*] 2. 0 [*]dB). However, no correlation between results in (a) and (b) both obtained with FS 4 was found. In conclusion, the degree of IPD sensitivity determined on an apical interaural electrode pair was not an indicator for BILD based on bilateral multielectrode stimulation...|$|R

To {{meet the challenges of}} increasing design complexity, computer-aided-design (CAD) tools have been involved to build DMFBs efficiently, where a two-stage design flow of fluidic-level synthesis followed by chip-level design are generally applied. Regarding fluidic-level synthesis, many related studies and CAD tools have been well-developed to synthesize the fluidic behaviors efficiently and effectively. However, research findings being highly-concerned with the chip-level design are still critically lacking. In this paper, we shall focus on chip-level design and discuss related background and two major optimization problems posed by <b>electrode</b> <b>addressing</b> and control pin routing. We show how CAD tools are involved to automate and optimize the two design problems. With this assistance, users can concentrate on the development and abstraction of nanoscale bioassays while leaving chip optimization and implementation details to CAD tools. I...|$|R
