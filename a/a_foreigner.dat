5|$|American {{officers}} serving under Pulaski {{had difficulty}} taking orders from <b>a</b> <b>foreigner</b> who could scarcely speak English and whose ideas {{of discipline and}} tactics differed enormously from those {{to which they were}} accustomed. This resulted in friction between the Americans and Pulaski and his fellow Polish officers. There was also discontent in the unit over delays in pay, and Pulaski's imperious personality was a regular source of discontent among his peers, superiors, and subordinates. Pulaski was also unhappy that his suggestion to create a lancer unit was denied. Despite a commendation from Wayne, these circumstances prompted Pulaski to resign his general command in March 1778, and return to Valley Forge.|$|E
5|$|At first Catherine {{kept the}} nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, and slept in his chamber. She presided over his council, decided policy, and {{controlled}} state business and patronage. However, {{she was never}} {{in a position to}} control the country as a whole, which was on the brink of civil war. In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways difficult for her to comprehend as <b>a</b> <b>foreigner.</b>|$|E

Their son, Pericles the Younger, must have been born by 440 BC. Aspasia would have to have been quite young, if she were able to bear a child to Lysicles c. 428 BC.|$|E

Obama was neither greeted nor acknowledged by King Salman during the encounter.|$|E

Additionally, he left an endowment for the performance of his late motet, Pater noster, at all general processions in the town when they passed in front of his house, stopping to place a wafer on the marketplace altar to the Holy Virgin. Pater noster may have been his last work.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the Jaffna kingdom is obscure and still the subject of {{controversy}} among historians. Among mainstream historians, such as K. M. de Silva, S.

He deposed the ruling Parakrama Pandyan II, <b>a</b> <b>foreigner</b> from the Pandyan Dynasty who was ruling the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa at the time {{with the help of his}} soldiers and mercenaries from the Kalinga, modern Kerala and Damila (Tamil Nadu) regions in India.|$|E

5|$|A {{doctoral}} student of Curie, Marguerite Perey, {{became the first}} woman elected to membership in the Academy– over half a century later, in 1962. Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobia—the same that had led to the Dreyfus affair–which also fueled false speculation that Curie was Jewish. During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right wing press who criticised her for being <b>a</b> <b>foreigner</b> and an atheist. Her daughter later remarked on the public hypocrisy as the French press often portrayed Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but would portray her as a French hero when she received a foreign one such as her Nobel Prizes.|$|E
5|$|The Emperor's great-grandmother, Maria I of Portugal, {{had been}} a queen regnant. However, she had been married to her uncle, Pedro III of Portugal who was a Braganza. This meant that her {{offspring}} would continue {{to belong to the}} House of Braganza. Emperor Pedro II was the last of the direct male line in Brazil descended from Dom Afonso I, first king of Portugal and founder, in 1139, of the dynasty which headed the Brazilian Empire. There were two other male Braganzas, albeit living abroad: Pedro II's half-brother Rodrigo Delfim Pereira and his cousin Miguel, Duke of Braganza. Both were barred from the line of succession, however. The former because he was an illegitimate son, and the latter because he was <b>a</b> <b>foreigner</b> and not a descendant of the first Brazilian Emperor, Pedro I.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} begins on November 3, 1966 with Guevara {{arriving}} in Bolivia {{disguised as a}} middle-aged representative of the Organization of American States hailing from Uruguay, who subsequently drives into the mountains to meet his men.

On Day 26, there is solidarity among Guevara's men despite his status as <b>a</b> <b>foreigner.</b> By Day 67, Guevara, however, has been set up for betrayal. He tries to recruit some peasants only to be mistaken for a cocaine smuggler, and the Bolivian Communist Party, led by Mario Monje, refuse to support the armed struggle. On Day 100, there is a shortage of food and Guevara exercises discipline to resolve conflicts between his Cuban and Bolivian followers.|$|E
