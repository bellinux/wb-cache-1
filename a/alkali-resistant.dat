40|$|ABSTRACT: In general, a sizing {{is shown}} to {{significantly}} affect both the population and size of flaws on the fibre surface by healing effects. Different <b>alkali-resistant</b> glass (ARG) fibres are coated with special polymer dispersions to provide superior alkali resistance and compared with HTA carbon fibres. Durability testing in highly concentrated NaOH-solutions at ambient and elevated temperatures revealed significant reduction of sizing content of the ‘‘as received’ ’ ARG fibres after short-term testing.
