40|$|The {{challenge}} facing South African foundries today are {{compliance with the}} environmental legislations while maintaining a high production rate. The focus {{of this study is}} to assist foundries to comply with National Environment Management Air Quality Act 39 of 2004. The aim of the study is to achieve a foundry with high production rate with low energy consumption and low emissions, while complying with air quality legislation. Data was collected from foundries within the Cities of Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg. Foundries were requested to provide information such as the raw materials feed rate, and production rate, emission units, type of energy used and consumption rates. Seventeen foundries participated in this study. Data collected from these foundries assisted in determining the emissions rate generated during production process. Emissions were quantified from the foundries using emission factors. In this study electricity and natural gas were found to be the most preferred source of energy in the foundries. An energy intensity relationship exists, for both electricity and natural gas and its production rate. The results indicated efficiency of energy intensity of 0. 25 to 6. 37 GJ/Tonne in the foundries. Selection of furnace used by the facilities plays an important role on the energy saving and emission reduction. Foundries that need to reduce particulate matters on the melting should consider electric arc furnace because it generate less particulate matters than open hearth. Foundries that would like to reduce sulphur dioxide should consider electric arc furnace rather than open hearth. Foundries that have challenges on the NOx should consider open hearth furnace than electric arc. An installation of suitable abatement systems should also be considered for the reduction of other pollutants. Results indicated that installation of <b>abatement</b> <b>system</b> at 95 % efficiency will decrease emission rates by twenty times.

The destruction of greenhouse gases, specifically perfluorocompounds, hydrofluorocompounds, chlorofluorocompounds (PFCs, HFCs, CFCs) and SF 6, is paramount to significantly affecting atmospheric pollution. The premise {{of this study was}} to examine the design of the plasma <b>abatement</b> <b>system</b> for Global Warming Gases (GWGs) and its abatement potential for these gases. The first goal was to reduce the cost of ownership by examining the cooling system. The cost of an air cooling design was $ 1400 /yr. The intent was to reduce the amount of air used or use a different medium that would produce the same amount of heat transfer. A liquid cooling system design had a cost of only $ 150 /yr. A C 4 F 8 abatement experiment was run on the liquid cooling design. The abatement process resulted in a destruction removal efficiency (DRE) of C 4 F 8 of 97. 5 percent. A lower operational cost unit was developed, but the operational performance was less than previous investigations. The second goal was to simulate the semiconductor radio frequency etching process and abate the output gases of the C 4 F 8 and SiO 2 reaction. The outcomes of this experiment included a microwave simulation of the radio frequency etching reaction and an abatement that resulted in a 99. 98 plus/minus. 05 percent DRE for C 4 F 8 with no formation of any other CFC gases.
