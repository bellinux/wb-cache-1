He later returned to Boston to work for Curtis Guild, Sr. (father of Governor Curtis Guild, Jr.), who published the market edition of the Boston Commercial Bulletin. He then worked for the Boston Daily Advertiser as an editorial writer. He was widely known for his writings on finance and tariffs. In 1887, Bennett retired from the Advertiser and founded Frank P.

40|$|Great Britain {{discouraged}} her American colonies from manufacturing textiles as {{she wanted}} that market {{for her own}} goods. Even after the United States won independence, Americans bought British products, including fine wool fabrics for men 2 ̆ 7 s wear, as home production could not meet demand. George Washington, however, made a political statement by wearing a suit of domestically-manufactured wool broadcloth for his 1789 inauguration. His Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, saw the need to wean Americans from foreign manufactures. He therefore encouraged Congress to enact tariffs on imported fabrics to stimulate domestic manufacturing and raise revenue. (Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s policies sowed the seeds of partisan politics as they met opposition from Thomas Jefferson and fellow proponents of the agrarian way of life.) This paper surveys the fledging <b>American</b> <b>wool</b> industry and related domestic wool production. The manufacture of fine fabrics required high-quality raw wool, and much of this, too, was imported. George Washington Parke Custis (Washington 2 ̆ 7 s step-grandson) held sheep shearing fairs to encourage improvement of native breeds. Elsewhere in the U. S., others imported Merinos, which produced top quality wool, from abroad. Politics intervened again as first Jefferson and then James Madison advocated embargoes on foreign trade that cut off the supply of British textiles. The 1812 declaration of war not only {{put an end to}} trade with Great Britain but also increased demand for wool fabrics for military uniforms and equipment. The story continues through the war years as these developments impacted production of the raw material and the finished product...|$|E

40|$|The United States {{occupies}} a rather unique {{position in the}} world wool trade - besides being one of the world's largest apparel wool producers, she also needs to supplement her requirements by sizeable imports from wool surplus countries. However, wool imports into the U. S. have a strong competitive advantage over domestic wools, not only price-wise but also on account of their uniformity and generally better preparation. For this reason the ability of the wool exporting countries to enlarge very substantially their markets in the U. S. by displacing some domestic wools is largely dependent on the American policy of sheltering and fostering the domestic wool industry. For decades, the traditional means of achieving this has been by levying specific tariff duties of varying height on fine apparel wools which proved to be a potential threat to finer Territory (i. e. domestic) grades. Non-competitive carpet wools, on the other hand, imported mainly from Argentina and Uruguay, have been exempt from duty. More recently, with the aim of stimulating wool production to a level compatible with the strategic raw material needs of the U. S., an incentive subsidy program administered by the U. S. Secretary of Agriculture has been superimposed on the existing tariff structure. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to discuss the rationale of the new wool program against the background of the traditional <b>American</b> <b>wool</b> policy, and at a later stage, to explore its implications for American apparel wool imports in general and from Australia in particular.

Capable of storing five million pounds of wool and hides, the building also housed the offices of the Bond-McRae wool trading company, the Wool Warehouse Company, and the New Mexico Cooperative Wool Marketing Association. Bond was the president of the former two companies, both of which were taken over by his son in 1936.|$|R
2500|$|Alpaca fiber {{is similar}} in {{structure}} to sheep wool fiber. [...] Its softness comes from having a different smoother scale surface than sheep <b>wool.</b> <b>American</b> breeders have enhanced the softness by selecting for finer fiber diameter fiber, similar to merino wool. Fiber diameter is a highly inherited trait in both alpaca and sheep. The difference in the individual fiber scales compared to sheep wool also creates the glossy shine which is prized in alpaca. Alpaca fibers have a higher tensile strength than wool fibers. In processing, slivers lack fiber cohesion and single alpaca rovings lack strength. Blend these together and the durability is increased several times over. More twisting is necessary, especially in Suri, and this can reduce a yarn's softness.|$|R

Yhdysvaltain ja Venäjän välisestä kauppavaihdosta 90 - 95 % kulki Itämeren satamien ja Juutinrauman kautta. Vertailuaineistonaan hän on päätynyt käyttämään Juutinrauman tullitilastoja, koska molempien maiden ulkomaankauppatilastoja pidetään itsessään vajavaisina. Ahonen etsi tullikirjoista amerikkalaiset alukset, joita lähes 80 vuoden aikana purjehti salmesta noin 9500. Hän käytti näiden alusten lasteja sekä niiden koti-, lastaus- ja määräsatamatietoja keskeisimpänä tilastomateriaalinaan. Hän käytti työssään myös muita lähteitä, mm. Itämeren piirissä toimineiden amerikkalaisten ja englantilaisten lähettiläiden ja konsulien raportteja. Ahonen tarkastelee työssään mm. valtioiden välistä kauppadiplomatiaa, kaupan piirissä toimivia yrittäjiä sekä heidän toimintatapansa. Myös kauppavaihdon määrä on hänen huomionsa kohteena. The {{purpose of}} this study is to discuss the {{development}} of trade and polito-commercial relations between the U. S and Russia from the Treaty of Paris in 1783 to 1860. The problems are approached on four levels: 1) commercial diplomacy between the countries, 2) the entrepreneurs involved in commerce and their activities, 3) mercantile shipping, 4) the volume of trade. The neutrality of trade and the seas (free ships-free goods) was the cornerstone of American commercial and foreign policy. Britain did not accept the principle in the forms proposed by Washington and the Department of State sought support from Russia. The results were poor. Articles of neutrality were even omitted from the commercial treaty concluded between Russia and the U. S. in 1832. In the name of freedom of the seas the U. S. took the initiative in the abolition of the old Danish Sound dues in 1857. Most of the entrepreneurs in American trade with Baltic Russia were from New England, as were the ships, brigs, barks and schooners that crossed the Atlantic. At first insufficient information about the distant markets was the biggest obstacle to commercial intercourse. The captains and supercargoes played a crucial role in getting the best cargoesfor the Russian markets and find the most reliable trading house in St Petersburg to deal with. In practice about 90 - 95 percent of the trade between Russia and the U. S was carried through the Sound, 95 percent of it on American vessels. According to the Sound Toll Accounts and Consular reports altogether 9500 American vessels sailed to the Baltic and back in the period 1783 - 1860. Most of them visited St Petersburg. European wars created new opportunities for the Americans to trade with Russia. During the Continental SystemAmericans sailing under the neutral flag ”found” excellent markets for their colonial products in St Petersburg. The good days came to an end during the Anglo-American War in 1812 - 14. Initially the U. S. imports from Russia were bar iron, hemp and “manufactures” (i. e. hemp and flax cloths). The main American exports and re-exports to St. Petersburg consisted of a wide range of products (e. g. sugar, rice, tobacco, coffee, cotton, spices). From the 1820 s onwards American merchants created ”the sugar triangle”: the trade from New England via Havana to St Petersburg and back to the ports of Massachusetts or New York. The sugar carried by the Americans was worth over twice as much as direct exports from the U. S. to Russia. At the beginning of the 1850 s ”the cotton triangle” entered the scene. <b>Americans</b> carried cotton <b>wool</b> from Southern ports to St Petersburg and sailed back to western Europe, New York or Boston. The raw sugar and cotton the Americans carried gave a major boost to the creation of modern industrial production in Russia. British money played a central role in the shipments of sugar and cotton. Over 45 percent of the American tonnage involved in commerce with Russia did not trade directly between the two countries...|$|R
