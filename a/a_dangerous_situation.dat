5|$|Christopher Richter {{suggested}} that the majority's legalistic approach, while yielding a workable construction of {{the provisions of the}} Migration Act, resulted in <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>situation</b> in this case because the Act did not specifically address the situation of stateless persons, and the literal approach did not allow for gaps in the legislation to be filled.|$|E
5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella {{is a prime}} example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand the difference between gender and race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back in touch with her African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>situation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Enemies {{can hear}} {{footsteps}} and other sounds. When Fiona is in <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>situation,</b> she may {{fall into a}} panic. During panic mode, visibility gets worse, the menu can't be opened, and she will begin running on her own, tripping and falling into walls. Panic mode will elapse after some time, or certain items {{can be used to}} calm her down. If Fiona sustains a significant amount of damage, she will slow down and become unable to backstep. If she receives too much damage she can die. Damage heals with time or items can be used to bring her vitality back to normal. While some items are used to heal Fiona and Hewie, others are used to damage enemies. Some can be thrown while others are set like traps for the enemy to walk over. Some items are found by searching while others can be crafted in refining rooms.|$|E

5|$|To the LCL, {{this was}} <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>situation,</b> and seeing {{a need to}} avoid it, they compromised: their {{position}} abruptly changed to being in favour of wholesale reform of the Legislative Council. When Dunstan put forward bills to reform it, the LCL relented, and Eastick convinced the LCL councillors to let them pass, conditional on amendments to the legislation. These were a minor change to the particular proportional system used to elect the councillors, and that it remained non compulsory {{to vote in the}} council. The new council would eventually have 22 members, with half elected each election from a multi-member constituency covering the entirety of the state. Hall attacked the LCL for its sudden change in stance on reform, and managed to see the first LM policy become law with the lowering of the council suffrage age to 18.|$|E
5|$|In May, Natalia {{was granted}} a travel permit to join Michael. Accompanied by family friends Prince Putyatin and Margaret Abakanovich, she arrived at Perm before the Orthodox Easter and they spent about a week together. Meanwhile, {{as part of the}} truce between the Bolsheviks and the Central Powers, prisoners-of-war from Austria–Hungary were being shipped out of Russia. Czech troops were strung out along the Trans-Siberian Railway on their way to Vladivostok, where they were due to take ship. The Czechs, though, were not going home to fight for the Austrian empire but to fight for a {{separate}} homeland independent of Austria. The Germans demanded that the Bolsheviks disarm the Czechs, who fought back, seized the railway, joined forces with Russians fighting against the Bolsheviks and advanced westwards toward Perm. With the approach of the Czechs, Michael and Natalia feared that she would become trapped there, possibly in <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>situation</b> and so, on 18 May, she left unhappily. By early June, Michael was again ill with stomach trouble.|$|E
5|$|With {{its ranks}} {{replenished}} after the winter actions, the six-regiment division under Nansouty numbered, on 1 June 1807, {{no less than}} 3,257 men. It {{was by far the}} most powerful heavy cavalry division of the Cavalry Reserve, which then included two other such divisions, the 2nd under Saint-Sulpice and a newly added 3rd, under Espagne. As military operation resumed later in 1807, Nasouty's division was hastily directed towards the town of Deppen, where Marshal Michel Ney had managed to retreat with his Corps, after energetically extricating himself from <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>situation,</b> with surprisingly few losses. With Ney's Corps, the Cavalry Reserve and the Guard, Napoleon moved towards Guttstadt, where on 9 June he found a large combined-arms enemy force. Murat took Lasalle's light horse and Nansouty's heavy cavalry and launched a series of charges that drove back the enemy force. Murat continued to press on and pushed the enemy into the streets of Guttstadt, where he penetrated with the cavalry at nightfall. Having fought well with his men, Nansouty was rested the next day, leaving all the action at the Battle of Heilsberg to Espagne's 3rd Heavy Cavalry division.|$|E

5|$|Seeing this inauspicious development, Wrede {{sent his}} cavalry, {{no less than}} 7,000 men, to charge Drouot's grand battery. The steady French {{canister}} fire was devastating and many Coalition squadrons turned back to safety. Some of them did manage {{to get to the}} French guns and crossed the battery, with the Guard cavalry immediately countercharging and driving them off. With the gun line now out of danger, Nansouty, with the aid of Sebastiani's cuirassiers launched a pursuit of the repulsed enemy horse, encountering and breaking an Austrian cuirassier regiment, the Knesevich Dragoon regiment and two Bavarian chevaulegers regiments, all under the personal command of Field Marshal-Lieutenant Franz Splény de Miháldy. Then, with a manoeuvre resembling that of Kellermann at Marengo, Nansouty wheeled his men left and rushed onto the enemy infantry, breaking them. The Grenadiers-à-Cheval were {{in the thick of the}} fighting and, with an offensive comeback of the Bavarian cavalry, they were momentarily in <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>situation,</b> but were duly rescued by the Gardes d'Honneur regiment. Nansouty then took his entire cavalry and broke the remaining enemy squares and cavalry, pushing some of these men into the Kinzig river. Meanwhile, Nansouty's action left Sebastiani free to silence the Bavarian grand battery, skilfully using Saint-Germain's cuirassier division and Exelmans's light division of his Corps. Nansouty received a light wound during this battle, but his role at Hanau is compared by a Russian author to that of Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz at the Battle of Zorndorf.|$|E

50|$|In {{the event}} that a flash flood watch is {{likely to lead to}} a major flash flood disaster, {{enhanced}} wording with the words This is <b>a</b> particularly <b>dangerous</b> <b>situation</b> (PDS) can be added to the watch; this is occasionally issued.|$|R
25|$|A clear {{circumstance}} {{where an}} individual {{may be found}} liable for omitting to act is where they create <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>situation,</b> which may reasonably put others at risk. In such instances, if the individual is aware that they have created the risk, they are under an obligation to prevent harm from resulting. The principles outlined by Lord Diplock in R v Miller show clearly {{that there is a}} duty for risk creators to take any measure that is reasonably within their power, and that a failure to do so will often result in criminal liability. Such duties may also arise where an individual, who is unaware of any risk their conduct creates, becomes aware that they have created <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>situation,</b> and then fails to act. Where in Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner a man unintentionally drove onto a policeman's foot, it was his failure to move after he became aware of his conduct that formed the basis for his conviction.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{ended up}} in <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>situation</b> mostly because of unprofessional handling by the Captain. Since the desired initiative of the First Officer had been curbed and a communication barrier had already been created by the Captain, the First Officer failed to intervene and take over the controls to pull the aircraft out of danger and display the required Crew Resources Management (CRM) skills.|$|E
25|$|The heat {{exchangers}} in direct-combustion furnaces, typical in many residences, are not 'coils'. They are, instead, gas-to-air {{heat exchangers}} that are typically made of stamped steel sheet metal. The combustion products pass {{on one side}} of these heat exchangers, and air to heat on the other. A cracked heat exchanger is therefore <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>situation</b> that requires immediate attention because combustion products may enter living space.|$|E

25|$|Interactions {{with other}} dogs, {{especially}} first meetings, should be managed carefully. One {{of the tasks}} of a livestock guardian is to kill wolves, coyotes, and other predators, and this instinct remains intact in the modern dog. Handlers should be alert to signs of tension, and intervene before <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>situation</b> develops. However, a well socialized, well trained Kuvasz will usually ignore, play with, or go exploring with other dogs once a successful introduction has been made.|$|E
25|$|In 219, Liu Bei's general Guan Yu led {{his forces}} to attack Fancheng (樊城, present-day Fancheng District, Xiangyang, Hubei), which was guarded by Cao Ren, one of Cao Cao's cousins and trusted generals. At the time, Man Chong was in Fancheng to assist Cao Ren in {{resisting}} Guan Yu's attack. They were thrown into <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>situation</b> when heavy rains caused flooding {{in the region}} and parts of Fancheng's walls began to crumble. To make matters worse, the flood destroyed the reinforcements led by Cao Cao's general Yu Jin, who surrendered to the enemy. Guan Yu kept pressing the attack on Fancheng all this while.|$|E
25|$|In rural areas, {{schools have}} been {{reported}} to have gained the improved sanitation facility. Given the existing socio-cultural norms and situation of sanitation in schools, girl students are forced not to relieve themselves in the open unlike boys. Lack of facilities in home forces women to wait for the night to relieve themselves and avoid being seen by others. Access to sanitation in some parts of northern India is very poor: about 85% of the rural households in Bihar have no access to a toilet; and this creates <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>situation</b> for women and girls who are followed, attacked and raped in the fields.|$|E

25|$|In {{the common}} law of England and Wales there is no {{criminal}} liability for failing {{to act in the}} event of another person being in danger; however, there are exceptions to this rule. In instances where there has been an assumption of responsibility by the bystander, <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>situation</b> was created by them, or there is a contractual or statutory duty to act, criminal liability would be imposed on the bystander for their failure to take action. The courts are reluctant to penalize people attempting rescue and English law makes provision for the actions of 'good Samaritans,' unless their actions were grossly negligent or made a situation worse.|$|E
25|$|Anti-lock brakes are {{the subject}} of some {{experiments}} centred around risk compensation theory, which asserts that drivers adapt to the safety benefit of ABS by driving more aggressively. In a Munich study, half a fleet of taxicabs was equipped with anti-lock brakes, while the other half had conventional brake systems. The crash rate was substantially the same for both types of cab, and Wilde concludes this was due to drivers of ABS-equipped cabs taking more risks, assuming that ABS would take care of them, while the non-ABS drivers drove more carefully since ABS would not be there to help in case of <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>situation.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 203 BC, {{after his}} {{victory at the}} Battle of Wei River, Han Xin conquered the Qi kingdom and sent a {{messenger}} to Liu Bang, requesting that Liu appoint him as the acting King of Qi.
