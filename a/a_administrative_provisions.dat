About 350 persons {{working in the field}} of the RVV 1990 and BABW had participated in the refresher courses given by the Police Traffic Institute (PVI) in October 1993. During these days the participants were surveyed about their opinions about and experiences with the new regulations and provisions. This was done by means of a written questionnaire. The results of the questionnaire are described in this report. About 80 to 90 per cent of the refresher course participants had filled in the questionnaire. In general, the participants show a positive attitude towards the new legislation...|$|R

Ngo in 2006 to impose a procedural default component. This piece argues that we should take seriously Justice Breyer’s Woodford concurrence, in which he noted that administrative law doctrine contains well-established exceptions to exhaustion. Although this point might at first seem inconsistent with other Supreme Court cases interpreting the PLRA, this Article argues that Justice Breyer’s concurrence can be reconciled with those opinions. PLRA exhaustion invokes regular administrative law exhaustion doctrine {{so long as it}} is not inconsistent with the statute. More generally, the Article argues that we should take administrative law seriously in the corrections context...|$|R
40|$|On November, 1, 1991, both {{a revised}} Traffic Regulations and Road Traffic Signs Code (RVV 1990) and <b>a</b> new <b>Administrative</b> <b>Provisions</b> for Road Traffic Order (BABW) was {{introduced}} in the Netherlands. This paper describes the first, preparatory phase of the evaluation of the introduction of both legislations. A pilot questionnaire study was carried out in October and November 1991 among police officers, municipal road maintenance authorities, and representatives of driving schools. In general, both the police officers and municipal road authorities were more familiar with both legislations than the driving-school owners and driving instructors. A majority of the municipal road authorities believed that the consequences of the introduction would cause a work load increase. However, the opinions of police officers with respect to the consequences of the introduction for work load seemed to be divided. The results of the study should be considered as both a global and a limited inventory of the three target groups' opinions about the introduction of both legislations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an evaluation study {{that is based}} on surveys taken from nationwide, random questionnaires held amongst approximately 40 road maintenance authorities. The aim was to assess the effect of parallel policy. The Dutch government developed and implemented parallel policy. This policy also applied to road maintenance authorities. The aim of parallel policy was to support the effect of the introduction of both a revised Traffic Regulations and Road Traffic Signs Code (RVV 1990) and <b>a</b> new <b>Administrative</b> <b>Provisions</b> for Road Traffic Order (BABW) in the Netherlands on November 1, 1991. The following criteria should be met in order to assess compliance to parallel policy: (1) 65 % of the road authorities must be aware of the outlines of the new implementation regulations; (2) 65 % must have an insight into a conservative and well-considered use of both traffic signs and symbols; and (3) 65 % must know the correct procedure to follow for the preparation and implementation of traffic regulations applicable in the new situation. It can be concluded that these three criteria were not, or only partially, satisfied...|$|R
40|$|In the {{judgment}} commented upon, the Supreme Administrative Court assumes {{that there are}} no grounds to issue, in <b>administrative</b> proceedings, <b>a</b> ruling on recreating the document confirming title to land; such a decision cannot in particular be based on Art. 288 and 297 of the Act - Law on Proceedings Before Administrative Courts, applied by analogy. Issue of a document of title to land confirming acquisition f title to land pursuant to the Enfranchisement Act can be proven using any kind of evidence in any proceedings before a general court.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study that}} was conducted surrounding {{the introduction of the}} revised Traffic Regulations and Road Traffic Signs Code (RVV 1990) and <b>a</b> new <b>Administrative</b> <b>Provisions</b> for Road Traffic Order (BABW) in the Netherlands, on November, 1, 1991. The aim is to evaluate both regulations and their flanking policy. For the evaluation, road users, road authorities and, on a small scale, representatives of various organizations were questioned. A part of the flanking policy was aimed at road users, another part at road authorities. After introduction of the RVV 1990 and the BABW, road authorities were aware of the principle, but not of the accurate contents of regulations and provisions. Following introduction of the new RVV and BABW, police, judicial bodies and road authorities had many questions. In the course of time, these questions were answered through joint consultation between various bodies. Some of the questions suggested a need to modify the RVV 1990 and BABW. In retrospect, most organizations judged the updated RVV quite favourable. On the whole, the regulations have become clearer and the distinction between the RVV and the BABW is now better defined. But almost all organisations believe that the new RVV should be adapted...|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Congress required the Small Business Administration (SBA) to implement a total of eight <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions</b> to help facilitate small business lending and enhance liquidity in the secondary markets. These <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions</b> include (1) temporarily requiring SBA to reduce or eliminate certain fees on 7 (a) and 504 loans; (2) temporarily increasing the maximum 7 (a) guarantee from 85 percent to 90 percent; and (3) implementing provisions designed specifically to facilitate secondary markets, such as extending existing guarantees in the 504 program and making loans to systemically important brokerdealers that operate in the 7 (a) secondary market. Further, ARRA established deadlines for SBA to issue regulations that implement certain <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions,</b> such as those pertaining to facilitating secondary market activities. Specifically, ARRA required SBA to issue regulations extending the guarantee related to the 504 program within 15 days after enactment (March 4, 2009) and for making loans to systemically important broker-dealers within 30 days after enactment (March 19, 2009). ARRA also mandates that we report within 60 days after the date of enactment, April 17, 2009, on SBA's initial efforts to comply with these provisions. In response, this report (1) summarizes key activities undertaken by the Administrator of SBA to implement the <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions</b> including establishment of project plans with timelines for fulfilling responsibilities, and (2) analyze whether the Administrator is accomplishing the purpose of increasing liquidity in the secondary markets for SBA loans. Because SBA's efforts are still in their early stages, we agreed with the staffs of the House and Senate Committees on Small Business to focus our work on four key <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions</b> {{for the purposes of}} this report. These four provisions are eliminating or reducing fees on 7 (a) and 504 loans, extending the existing guarantee on 7 (a) loans, and taking two specific steps to facilitate activities in the secondary markets: extending the guarantee on 504 financing and making loans to systemically important broker-dealers. However, consistent with ARRA's requirements, we are also providing information on the status of SBA's implementation of the other four <b>administrative</b> <b>provisions.</b> ...|$|R
