'I know,' he says, 'that even marriages of inclination do not always succeed. So from the fact that sometimes people make mistakes in their choice, it is concluded that we ought never to choose.'

5000|$|Déjacque [...] "rejected Blanquism, {{which was}} based on a {{division}} between the ‘disciples of the great people’s Architect’ and ‘the people, or vulgar herd,’ and was equally opposed to all the variants of social republicanism, to the dictatorship of one man and to ‘the dictatorship of the little prodigies of the proletariat.’ With regard to the last of these, he wrote that: ‘a dictatorial committee composed of workers is certainly the most conceited and incompetent, and hence the most anti-revolutionary, thing that can be found...(It is better to have doubtful enemies in power than dubious friends)’. He saw ‘anarchic initiative,’ ‘reasoned will’ and ‘the autonomy of each’ as the conditions for the social revolution of the proletariat, the first expression of which had been the barricades of June 1848. In Déjacque’s view, a government resulting from an insurrection remains a reactionary fetter on the free initiative of the proletariat. Or rather, such free initiative can only arise and develop by the masses ridding themselves of the ‘authoritarian prejudices’ by means of which the state reproduces itself in its primary function of representation and delegation. Déjacque wrote that: ‘By government I understand all delegation, all power outside the people,’ for which must be substituted, in a process whereby politics is transcended, the ‘people in direct possession of their sovereignty,’ or the ‘organised commune.’ For Déjacque, the communist anarchist utopia would fulfil the function of inciting each proletarian to explore his or her own human potentialities, in addition to correcting the ignorance of the proletarians concerning ‘social science.’"He also thought that [...] "government, religion, property, family, all are linked, all coincide.’ The content of the social revolution was thus to be the abolition of all governments, of all religions, and of the family based on marriage, the <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> and the husband, and inheritance." ...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{looks at}} <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social policy <b>of</b> {{community}} care for infirm elderly parents on their supporting single daughters and sons˙ It {{is a small}} empirical study of a sample of 58 carers whose <b>parents</b> were on <b>the</b> district nursing records of one area health <b>authority.</b> Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> were in their eighties or nineties and all had multiple impairments.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I examine <b>the</b> {{representation}} <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> and schoolmasters and the conflicts {{between them in}} vernacular drama in Reformation England. This {{was a period of}} growth in public schooling and a time when numerous treatises on education and childrearing were in circulation in England. Prevailing pedagogical theory privileged the schoolmaster's <b>authority</b> over that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents,</b> and set paternal <b>authority</b> over that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mother. It sought to limit maternal power to the domestic sphere and the infant years, yet the drama examined here suggests that mothers, not fathers, were usually <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> in control <b>of</b> their children's education. The conflicts inherent in these oppositions are played out in drama dealing with schooling and childrearing; each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> works examined here participates in and contributes to public debate over school education and parenting practices in early modern England. The thesis conducts a close textual and contextual analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> representation <b>of</b> schoolmasters and parents and of parent-school relations in seven English plays. A variety of dramatic genres is represented: public drama (Love's Labour's Lost, Patient Grissill, The Winter's Tale), school drama (Nice Wanton, July and Julian, The Disobedient Child), and private royal entertainment (<b>The</b> Lady <b>of</b> May). <b>The</b> plays are explicated in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tudor school culture and <b>the</b> negotiation <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> between fathers, mothers and schoolmasters. The thesis draws extensively on sixteenth-century school dialogues and vulgaria and on education treatises, which were available in English in Tudor England, in particular <b>the</b> writings <b>of</b> Erasmus, Vives, Ascham, Mulcaster, Elyot, Brinsley and Becon. School records provide information on school conditions and curricula, the duties and qualities <b>of</b> schoolmasters and <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> schools in civic and public performances.

40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this Article is two-fold. First, the Article {{argues that}} <b>the</b> <b>parent’s</b> right to educate {{his or her}} {{children}} is strictly circumscribed by <b>the</b> <b>parent’s</b> duty to ensure that children learn habits of critical reasoning and reflection. The law has long recognized that the state’s duty to educate children is superior to any parental right. Indeed, the “parentalist” position to the contrary rests on an inflation of rights that is, in fact, {{a radical departure from}} longstanding legal norms. Indeed, at common law <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> had “a sacred right” to <b>the</b> custody <b>of</b> his child, and <b>the</b> <b>parent’s</b> right to control <b>the</b> upbringing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child was “almost absolute. ” The great legal authorities—William Blackstone, James Kent, and their scholarly successors—are cited to this effect. Nevertheless, this reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law is sorely anachronistic—less history than advocacy on behalf of parental rights. If “fundamental” describes rights with a deep historical pedigree, <b>the</b> right to <b>parent</b> free of state interference cannot be numbered among fundamental rights. What is deeply rooted in our nation’s history is the notion that the state entrusts <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> with custody <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child only so long as <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> meets his duty to take proper care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child. Whether this authority is called a power or a right, it has always been contingent on <b>the</b> welfare <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child and <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state. It has always been “in <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> a trust, reposed in [the parent] by the State..., which may be extended or contracted as the public welfare may require. ” Second, the Article suggests that this trust principle—the notion that <b>the</b> <b>parent’s</b> educational authority is bound by <b>the</b> <b>parent’s</b> pedagogical duty—may, first, help us better understand <b>the</b> doctrinal modesty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court’s seminal “right to parent” cases, and, second, help the courts approach some difficult types of cases in a more principled way, especially cases involving <b>the</b> allocation <b>of</b> educational <b>authority</b> in <b>the</b> public schools. If the courts were to apply the principle that no authority, public or private, may deny children exposure to <b>the</b> full measure <b>of</b> intellectual incitement that should be the heart (and soul) of every young person’s education, they would more consistently and correctly sort out <b>the</b> competing claims <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> and public school officials to make educational choices on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child. Part II of this Article argues that at common law and, for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation’s history, under state statutory regimes, <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> to direct <b>the</b> child’s upbringing was a matter of duty, not right. Chief among parental obligations was the duty to provide the child with a suitable education. Indeed, it was the child who possessed “a perfect right”: the right to proper parental care, including the right to an education that would prepare the child for eventual enfranchisement from the primary familial culture. <b>The</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent’s</b> <b>authority</b> to direct the child’s education has always been limited, determined by <b>the</b> best interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child and <b>the</b> legitimate needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state. In the United States, custody courts created a composite system that allowed the state as parens patriae to regulate family relations, but as a general matter entrusted <b>parents</b> with <b>the</b> task <b>of</b> providing <b>the</b> child a proper education. Part III looks at the Supreme Court’s seminal cases establishing a parent’s right to educate: Meyer v. Nebraska and Pierce v. Society <b>of</b> Sisters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Names <b>of</b> Jesus and Mary. Commonly read to state broad claims about <b>the</b> fundamental nature <b>of</b> parental rights, these cases stand for a much more modest proposition: the state does not have exclusive authority over the child’s education and, more particularly, the state cannot prohibit parents from teaching their children subject matter outside <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state-mandated curriculum. Fearful that the state was claiming exclusive power to educate children, the seminal Supreme Court parenting cases sought to restore <b>the</b> composite character <b>of</b> educational <b>authority</b> over <b>the</b> child. Rhetoric aside, Meyer and Pierce are hardly a charter of fundamental parental rights. Part IV considers several types of cases that involve <b>the</b> allocation <b>of</b> educational <b>authority</b> within <b>the</b> public schools. While a full treatment of these cases lies outside <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Article, this Part suggests that courts should look with skepticism at any educational program—whether imposed by <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> or by <b>the</b> state—that, by restricting <b>the</b> spectrum <b>of</b> available knowledge, fails to prepare the child for obligations beyond those of familial obedience. In Meyer v. Nebraska, Arthur Mullen stood before the Supreme Court to argue against <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state “to take the child from <b>the</b> <b>parent.</b> ” He denounced “the principle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soviet” that made the state superior to the family. No state, Mullen argued, should “prescribe <b>the</b> mental bill <b>of</b> fare” that <b>the</b> child will follow. He would not accept, and neither would the Court, that the child is not <b>the</b> <b>parent’s</b> to begin with, and certainly not <b>the</b> mere recipient <b>of</b> whatever mental bill of fare is prescribed by <b>the</b> <b>parent.</b> Yet, surprisingly, <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> parent-relations, as developed by the American courts, did understand that, in <b>the</b> words <b>of</b> John Locke, <b>the</b> child must “grow up to <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> reason” and that if he is not <b>the</b> mere creature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state, he is more than a placid reflection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parental image. In short, <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> custody cases testifies to the enduring belief that the child is born to intellectual and moral freedom...|$|R

It is {{commonly}} assumed that parents have long enjoyed a fundamental legal right to control <b>the</b> upbringing <b>of</b> their children, but this reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law is sorely incomplete. What is deeply rooted in our legal traditions {{is the idea that}} <b>the</b> state entrusts <b>parents</b> with custody <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child, and the concomitant rule that the state does so only as long as parents meet their legal duty to take proper care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child. This book looks at four related areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law: parental custody, state regulation of education, religion and parental rights, and nonparental third party rights. In each, it is argued that, historically, <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> has been treated as a sacred trust, a delegation of state power made on the presumption that it will be employed to promote <b>the</b> eventual enfranchisement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child; that <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> a rights orientation has threatened to uncouple <b>the</b> traditional linkage <b>of</b> rights and responsibilities, subordinating <b>the</b> best interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child and <b>the</b> legitimate needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state to parental preferences; and that a renewed reliance on <b>the</b> trust model <b>of</b> parent-child relations would better serve both <b>the</b> developing personhood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child and the civil society to which he or she belongs. In each area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law, we face the same historical reality. It is the rights orientation that breaks with deeply rooted legal traditions and cultural values, rejecting time-honored trust principles of family law meant to protect both private and public interests. <b>The</b> law <b>of</b> parent-child relations has long embodied a belief that education (a “leading away from”) is the path away from childhood and toward intellectual and moral enfranchisement. Unless children are to live under “a perpetual childhood of prescription,” unless we are to deny them <b>the</b> pursuit <b>of</b> happiness, they must be exposed to the dust and heat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race, intellectually, morally, spiritually. It is no wonder then that we would want to transform <b>the</b> sacred trust <b>of</b> parenthood into a sacred right. But our legal traditions teach that parenthood is first and foremost not a sacred right but a sacred responsibility, a fiduciary duty owed equally to the child and the state. <b>The</b> Constitution’s guarantee <b>of</b> personal freedoms is meaningful only if we, as <b>parents,</b> accept <b>the</b> responsibilities from which parental authority arises, and <b>the</b> constitutional strength <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> privileges should depend on our willingness to do so. If by “fundamental” we designate rights with a deep historical pedigree, <b>the</b> right to <b>parent</b> free from state interference cannot be numbered among them. The American legal tradition is one that treated paternal absolutism and its rights foundation as barbaric. This is nowhere better seen than in child custody cases, where courts challenged, first, paternal authority and, then, parental control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child generally. Custodial authority, it was maintained by jurists and legal theoreticians alike, “is not <b>the</b> natural right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parents; it emanates from the State, and is an exercise of police power. ” Far from being absolute, <b>the</b> right to <b>parent</b> was not even the courts’ primary consideration. “The true view,” stated one court, “is that <b>the</b> rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child are alone to be considered. ” The prevailing legal currents, driven by <b>the</b> equitable force <b>of</b> trust principles, swept away claims of right advanced to support parental power. <b>The</b> right to <b>parent</b> as a matter of constitutional law is especially tenuous. The Supreme Court has on occasion echoed the popular assumption that <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and nurture of their children is a fundamental one, deeply rooted in legal tradition and honored by <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court. But no Supreme Court holding—including those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seminal <b>parenting</b> cases Meyer and Pierce, and modern variants like Yoder and Troxel—supports this claim. If <b>the</b> rigor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court with regard to <b>the</b> regulation <b>of</b> parental <b>authority</b> has varied, its scrutiny has never been strict. In fact, more than once the Court has declined the opportunity to adopt this position. As Justice Antonin Scalia has observed, there is little decisional support for the notion that <b>the</b> right to <b>parent</b> is a “substantive constitutional right” at all, let alone a fundamental one. To say that a parental rights orientation is not deeply rooted in our traditions is not to declare that a particular policy decision is right or wrong. It is simply {{to say that it is}} a question of policy whether and how the state should regulate parent-child relations. If we understand that, as a descriptive matter, <b>the</b> right to <b>parent</b> is at odds with a tradition of shared responsibility for <b>the</b> welfare <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child, we might be more willing to consider how old equitable principles can lead to new ways <b>of</b> accommodating <b>the</b> interests <b>of</b> <b>parent,</b> child, and state. By giving <b>parents</b> <b>the</b> right to bring up their children as they see fit, we forestall debate on such contentious questions as educational regulation, religious mentoring, and third-party visitation. We ought not to take these questions out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public domain by keeping the home under constitutional lock and key...|$|R
40|$|Typical parent {{education}} programs expect that parents of teenagers can (1) be empathetic listeners, (2) identify and express their own inner feelings, thoughts, and opinions, etc., (3) tolerate diversity of ideas, (4) set limits for their teenagers, and (5) take {{a perspective on}} their parenting processes. In other words, such programs assume that all <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> teenagers have <b>the</b> same abilities and are at the same developmental level. ^ This study challenged this assumption and addressed <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> readiness for parenting. Robert Kegan 2 ̆ 7 s subject-object theory {{was used as a}} context for <b>the</b> study. Twenty <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> teenagers were interviewed using Kegan and colleagues 2 ̆ 7 subject-object interview. The interviews were used to determine how parents were thinking about their parenting experiences, or, in other words, how these parents were structuring meaning around their <b>parenting</b> experiences. <b>The</b> analyses <b>of</b> these interviews, which were done by a certified subject-object assessor and myself, determined what was 2 ̆ 2 subject 2 ̆ 2 and what was 2 ̆ 2 object 2 ̆ 2 in <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> 2 ̆ 7 meaning-making structure.

40|$|At common law, and (for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation 2 ̆ 7 s history) {{under state}} {{statutory}} regimes, <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> to direct <b>the</b> child 2 ̆ 7 s upbringing {{was a matter}} of duty, not right, and chief among parental obligations was the duty to provide the child with a suitable education. It has long been a legal commonplace that at common law <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> had a 2 ̆ 2 sacred right 2 ̆ 2 to <b>the</b> custody <b>of</b> his or her child, that <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> 2 ̆ 7 s right to control <b>the</b> upbringing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child was almost absolute. But this reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law is sorely anachronistic, less history than advocacy on behalf of parental rights. What is deeply rooted in our nation 2 ̆ 7 s history—and the custody case law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth century and early twentieth century makes this abundantly clear—is the notion that the state only entrusts <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> with educational custody <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child, and does so only as long as <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> meets his or her duty to serve <b>the</b> best interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child. Indeed, it was the child who had an absolute right: the right to proper parental care, including the right to an education that would prepare the child for eventual enfranchisement from what Blackstone called the 2 ̆ 2 empire <b>of</b> <b>the</b> father. 2 ̆ 2 If by 2 ̆ 2 fundamental 2 ̆ 2 we designate rights with a deep historical pedigree, <b>the</b> right to <b>parent</b> free of state interference cannot be numbered among them. The Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s seminal cases establishing a parent 2 ̆ 7 s right to educate. Meyer and Pierce have been made to state broad claims about <b>the</b> fundamental nature <b>of</b> parental rights, but, in fact, they stand for a much more modest proposition: that the state does not have exclusive authority over the child 2 ̆ 7 s education; and, more particularly, that the state cannot prohibit parents from teaching their children subject matter outside <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state-mandated curriculum. Rhetoric aside, Meyer and Pierce are hardly a charter of fundamental parental rights. But that is what the Supreme Court made of these cases in Wisconsin v. Yoder. <b>The</b> idiosyncratic facts <b>of</b> Yoder encouraged <b>the</b> Supreme Court to abandon well established law governing <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> religious <b>parenting</b> and to formulate a harm standard ill-adapted to <b>the</b> existential intricacies <b>of</b> family disputes. Courts should look with skepticism at any authority that, by restricting <b>the</b> spectrum <b>of</b> available knowledge, fails to prepare the child for obligations beyond those of familial obedience. While a full treatment of these cases lies outside <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article, this part suggests that courts should look with skepticism at any educational program—whether the program is imposed by <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> or by <b>the</b> state—that, by restricting <b>the</b> spectrum <b>of</b> available knowledge, fails to prepare the child for obligations beyond those of familial obedience. If the courts were to apply the principle that children may not be denied exposure to <b>the</b> full measure <b>of</b> intellectual incitement that should be the heart (and soul) of every young person 2 ̆ 7 s education, they would more consistently, and correctly, sort out <b>the</b> competing claims <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> and public school officials to make educational choices on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child. <b>The</b> work <b>of</b> preparing <b>the</b> child to make free and independent choices is entrusted to <b>the</b> <b>parent,</b> and it is a challenging and somber task, for it means allowing children (in fact, it means helping children) to leave their homes and leave behind <b>the</b> ways <b>of</b> their <b>parents.</b> Or, at least, it means giving children the choice to do so. It is little wonder, then, that we would want to transform this sacred trust into a sacred right, a right that effectively allows parents to shield their children from choice and its attendant responsibilities. But <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> parent-child relations protects children from this sort of 2 ̆ 2 protection, 2 ̆ 2 ensuring that children receive a truly public education. Physically and intellectually transporting the child across <b>the</b> boundaries <b>of</b> home and community, a public education can bring its students a much needed respite from <b>the</b> ideological solipsism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enclosed family. <b>Of</b> course, public education comes at a cost. It disrupts <b>the</b> intramural transmission <b>of</b> values from parent to child. It threatens to dismantle a familiar world by introducing the child to multiple sources <b>of</b> authority—and to <b>the</b> possibility that a choice must be made among them. Indeed, <b>the</b> open world <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public school should challenge <b>the</b> transmission <b>of</b> any closed set of values. Unless children are to live under 2 ̆ 2 a perpetual childhood of prescription, 2 ̆ 2 they must be exposed to the dust and heat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race—intellectually, morally, spiritually. A public education is the engine by which children are exposed to 2 ̆ 2 the great sphere 2 ̆ 2 that is their world and legacy. It is their means of escape from, or free commitment to, the social group in which they were born. It is their best guarantee of an open future. The Yoder standard fails to protect the child from harms routinely addressed in cases involving only secular matters. Judicial non-intervention amounts to little more than a way of not dealing with such cases—or, at least, of not dealing with such cases until it is too late for the child. To honor its fiduciary obligation to the child, the court must be able to consider any practice that could affect <b>the</b> general welfare <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child and to insist upon an appropriate form of civil discourse when religious views diverge. Where exposure to intolerance is not in <b>the</b> best interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child, <b>the</b> welfare <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child requires that those responsible for their upbringing observe, or be made to observe, <b>the</b> boundaries <b>of</b> socially appropriate behavior. The duty to respect those with whom one disagrees is a civic obligation for which parents must prepare their children. It is <b>the</b> necessary concomitant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parenting</b> right. Religious belief should not absolve parents of this obligation, and disparagement born of religious conviction should not get a constitutional pass from judicial scrutiny...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Family Studies and Human ServicesFarrell J. WebbThe current {{military}} {{family life}} is punctuated {{by a series}} of events that are not present in <b>the</b> lives <b>of</b> most Americans, most notably the stress, fear, and disruption of lives that accompany <b>the</b> periodic absences <b>of</b> one or both adults in the family. These absences fostered by deployments, challenges of readjustments, coupled with combat injuries have tremendous effects on not only the troops and their families, but also the communities that military families live in as well. This investigation examined how military assistance, family connectedness and community networks contribute to <b>the</b> well-being <b>of</b> families affected by anticipated and repeated deployments that cause family interruptions. Despite <b>the</b> myriad <b>of</b> studies on military deployments and the impact on families, there has been little focus on the spouse and children that relates to their resilience during the deployment process. Using an online national all service unit sample from military spouses (n = 185) who have children and have experienced a recent deployment (n = 153) it was possible to isolated the specific components that influenced <b>the</b> well-being <b>of</b> those affected by deployments. <b>The</b> Influence <b>of</b> Interruptions on Family Well-Being Model—which combines ideas from both the ecological systems and boundary ambiguity perspectives—was tested and utilized in this study. It was disclosed that 45 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variance in well-being could be explained by knowing how families perceive the deployment process, military assistance, community networks, family connectedness, and how these families coped with periodic family interruptions.

30|$|In most cases, a {{child is}} under parental {{guidance}} or supervision for quite some time. As the personality develops a child begins to replace <b>the</b> parental <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> external world with their own internal authority {{and it is this}} process that creates the superego (Freud, [2003], pp. 124 – 143). The superego has two aspects called the ego-ideal and the conscience (Freud, [2003], pp. 124 – 143). <b>The</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superego is also affected by the pleasure principle because the child seeks to create pleasure by developing an internal gauge that supports <b>the</b> approval <b>of</b> their parental influence (Freud, [2003], pp. 124 – 143).

40|$|<b>The</b> author <b>of</b> {{this article}} starts with stating that social {{scientists}} {{have observed that}} peasants {{from all over the}} world seem more like each other in many ways than like their urban compatriots. This is manifested in Mexico by the fact that when townsman enters the peasant village he feels himself a stranger. The townsman, generally speaking, looks at the peasant either as a symbol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worst or the best in human nature, depending on his feelings about the modern world. It means that the peasant remains unknown. To understand him, we must grasp his view of life, his goals, his problems as he feels them, and the factors which set him at odds with the developing world. In this sense the author undertakes an analysis of character in one of Mexico villages, which before <b>the</b> Revolution <b>of</b> 1910. had lived in the frame od hacienda, according to economic characteristics capitalistic but to social relations feudal plantation. In the village traits can be found common to peasants everywhere, but also aspects of character that bear <b>the</b> stamp <b>of</b> Mexican history and traditions. In fact the analysis is based on <b>the</b> investigation <b>of</b> a group whose leader was Erich Fromm. In the village there are many economical and social problems, social differentiation and differentiation of character. There are also many signs of change, but a lot of influences of hacienda system on <b>the</b> character <b>of</b> peasants have remained. Passive characters are prevailing who sometimes express the total fatalims. People are distrustfull and do not accept innovations willingly. There is a need to seek a patron like former hacendado. The author thinks that all this is a consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> near history when hacienda had dominated, and the factors which nowdays in the nature and the society cause unsecurity and resignation <b>of</b> peasants. <b>The</b> author particularly analyses: <b>the</b> peasants view <b>of</b> love, <b>the</b> war between sexes and authority and family, basing his analysis on lengthy interviews of peasants and observations of investigators. Examples of peasants views of love show that <b>the</b> large majority <b>of</b> villagers have a passive orientation, not an active. In fact they reflect the feeling that all good things of life lie autside ol oneself, beyond reach. <b>The</b> roots <b>of</b> domination of these receptive orientation lie in cultural tradition, family life and social limitation of life experience, knowledge and opportunities. The superficial observer quickly concludes that Mexican men dominate their women in family and in the society, too. But in the Mexican village, like everywhere, the u^ar between the sexes rages, which assume many hidden forms and contents. While in families with both mother and father, a subtle but continual struggle for power rages, in <b>the</b> families <b>of</b> many alcoholics one finds a wife who deeply enjoys <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> martyred victim, trying to turn the children away from their father. Some men show traits <b>of</b> machismo, <b>the</b> cult <b>of</b> tough — acting, hard drinking promiscuous men, whose background is their unindependence and infatility. Women want to keep their husband, children and family. The reason that the Mexican villager avoids accepting authority and responsibility lies in <b>the</b> fact that <b>parents</b> demand from their children strict obedience. Therefore in <b>the</b> games <b>of</b> children everything is subjected to the central authority, similar to <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>parents.</b> <b>The</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> is historically planted by <b>the</b> long tradition <b>of</b> hacienda system and its residues. Child rearing in <b>the</b> i context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole cultural and social conditions in the village, had, for instance, a consequence that adolescent boys <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village treated investigators, who tryed to organize an agricultural club for them, as their patrons to whom they must remain submissive, awaiting orders. The author concludes that fatalism, distrust and hopelessness in this Mexican village were born in <b>the</b> experience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hacienda and reinforced by <b>the</b> scarcity <b>of</b> land and living, common to peasants everywhere.
