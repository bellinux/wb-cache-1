5|$|While most LARPs {{maintain}} <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> {{between the}} real world and the fictional setting, pervasive LARPs mingle fiction with modern reality in a fashion similar to alternate reality games. Bystanders who are unaware that a game is taking place may be treated as part of the fictional setting, and in-character materials may be incorporated into {{the real world}}.|$|E
5|$|Jain texts make <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> {{between the}} Sallekhana and suicide. Its dualistic {{theology}} differentiates between soul and matter. Soul is reborn in the Jain belief based on accumulated karma, how one dies {{contributes to the}} karma accumulation, and a pious death reduces the negative karmic attachments. The preparation for sallekhana must begin early, much before the approach of death, and when death is imminent, the vow of Sallekhana is observed by progressively slenderising {{the body and the}} passions.|$|E
5|$|When Peano {{formulated}} his axioms, {{the language}} of mathematical logic was in its infancy. The system of logical notation he created to present the axioms did not prove to be popular, although it was {{the genesis of the}} modern notation for set membership (∈, which comes from Peano's ε) and implication (⊃, which comes from Peano's reversed 'C'.) Peano maintained <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> between mathematical and logical symbols, which was not yet common in mathematics; such a separation had first been introduced in the Begriffsschrift by Gottlob Frege, published in 1879. Peano was unaware of Frege's work and independently recreated his logical apparatus {{based on the work of}} Boole and Schröder.|$|E

5|$|While monasticism {{had existed}} in Chinese Buddhism, the Northern Celestial Masters {{were one of}} the first Daoist groups to {{practice}} it. Kou lived a monastic lifestyle on Songshan, known today for being the location of the Shaolin Monastery. Monasticism developed further during the Louguan phase of the Northern Celestial Masters due to this influence of Buddhism. During this period, <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> developed between lay and monastic followers in Daoism. The ordination, precepts and way in which monks sought salvation were all influenced by Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|Batman: The Ultimate Evil {{is a novel}} {{written by}} Andrew Vachss and {{published}} in 1995 by the Warner Aspect imprint of Warner Books. Vachss was an attorney specializing in child abuse cases, {{as well as a}} crime novelist best known for his series of books featuring the character Burke, a private investigator who also takes on child abuse cases. A representative from DC Comics approached Vachss about the possibility of writing a novel featuring Batman. Viewing {{this as an opportunity to}} reach a completely different audience, Vachss agreed and wrote a draft. He continued with his themes concerning child sexual abuse and explored the topic of child sex tourism. The publisher required Vachss to follow certain rules, like making <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> between fiction and reality and prohibiting the Batman character from killing, cursing, or having sex.|$|E
5|$|The flaw in Dalton's {{theory was}} {{corrected}} in principle in 1811 by Amedeo Avogadro. Avogadro had proposed that equal volumes of any two gases, at equal temperature and pressure, contain {{equal numbers of}} molecules (in other words, the mass of a gas's particles {{does not affect the}} volume that it occupies). Avogadro's law allowed him to deduce the diatomic nature of numerous gases by studying the volumes at which they reacted. For instance: since two liters of hydrogen will react with just one liter of oxygen to produce two liters of water vapor (at constant pressure and temperature), it meant a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form two particles of water. Thus, Avogadro was able to offer more accurate estimates of the atomic mass of oxygen and various other elements, and made <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> between molecules and atoms.|$|E

50|$|The Scottish SPCA {{changed its}} logo in 2005 to make <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> between {{itself and the}} RSPCA {{in an attempt to}} prevent {{legacies}} being left to its English equivalent by mistake when the Scottish charity was intended.|$|R
5|$|In 1667 Nicholas Steno wrote a {{paper about}} a shark head he had dissected. He {{compared}} {{the teeth of}} the shark with the common fossil objects known as tongue stones. He concluded that the fossils must have been shark teeth. Steno then took an interest in the question of fossils, and to address some of the objections to their organic origin he began studying rock strata. The result of this work was published in 1669 as Forerunner to a Dissertation on a solid naturally enclosed in a solid. In this book, Steno drew <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> between objects such as rock crystals that really were formed within rocks and those such as fossil shells and shark teeth that were formed outside of those rocks. Steno realized that certain kinds of rock had been formed by the successive deposition of horizontal layers of sediment and that fossils were the remains of living organisms that had become buried in that sediment. Steno who, like almost all 17th century natural philosophers, believed that the earth was only a few thousand years old, resorted to the Biblical flood as a possible explanation for fossils of marine organisms that were far from the sea.|$|E
25|$|Some authors do {{not make}} <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> between {{algebraic}} sets and varieties and use irreducible variety to make the distinction when needed.|$|E

5000|$|At {{a speech}} at New York City Hall in 2001 Weiss criticized President George W. Bush for not making <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> between Arab acts of {{terrorism}} and Israeli acts of self-defense. [...] "The trap that he's falling into is that he's drawn a moral equivalency between cold-blooded murder and acts of self-defense," [...] Weiss said.|$|R
30|$|In general, {{because of}} less surface {{sensitivity}} (and hence less influence of oxygen-containing contaminants) oxygen NEXAFS spectra offered <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> between the surfactant and binder than the O 1 s XPS, which highlights a possible {{benefit of the}} technique. However, {{this needs to be}} balanced against the ease of accessing a lab based (XPS) vs. an exclusively synchrotron based (NEXAFS) technique.|$|R
25|$|Music {{journalists and}} fans of techno are {{generally}} {{selective in their}} use of the term; so <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> can be made between sometimes related but often qualitatively different styles, such as tech house and trance.|$|E
25|$|It is however {{possible}} to make <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> in religious denominations: {{the majority of the}} Poles were Latin Catholics, while the Ruthenians were mostly Greek Catholics. The Jews, who represented the third largest religious group, were mostly Orthodox in their religious observance.|$|E
25|$|The close helmet was {{developed}} from the later versions of the sallet and the superficially similar armet in the late 15th century. In contemporary sources it was sometimes {{also referred to as}} an 'armet', though modern scholarship draws <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> between the two types.|$|E
50|$|A third study design, the {{sequential}} design, combines both methodologies. Here, {{a researcher}} observes members of different birth cohorts {{at the same}} time, and then tracks all participants over time, charting changes in the groups. While much more resource-intensive, the format aids in <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> between what changes {{can be attributed to}} individual or historical environment from those that are truly universal.|$|R
40|$|Measurement of the serum Lactobacillus casei (`folic-acid') {{activity}} {{is widely used}} as an index of folic-acid deficiency. Present methods of assay result in recovery of about half the active material in normal serum. A modified method of assay is described which gives higher L. casei values and <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> between the sera of normal subjects and of patients with folic-acid deficiency...|$|R
50|$|The Gospel genre {{field was}} redefined to make <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> between the {{traditional}} gospel {{music and the}} style known as Contemporary Christian Music (CCM). As mentioned above, the Best Roots Gospel Album category is new. The categories in the Gospel field will now be known as Best Gospel Performance/Song, Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song, Best Gospel Album, Best Contemporary Christian Music Album and Best Roots Gospel Album.|$|R
25|$|Although most of {{the texts}} in Écrits and Autres écrits {{are closely related to}} Lacan's lectures or lessons from his Seminar, more often than not the style is denser than Lacan's oral delivery, and <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> between the {{writings}} and the transcriptions of the oral teaching is evident to the reader.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> between glass {{making and}} glass working must be made. Glass making is the {{production}} of raw glass from the raw materials. Glass working {{on the other hand}} refers to the processing of raw glass or recycled glass to create new glass objects, although this may take place in the same location as glass making, it can also take place elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Although some {{consider}} that the distinction between transpersonal psychology and the psychology of religion, is fading (e.g. The Oxford Handbook of Psychology and Spirituality), there is still {{generally considered to be}} <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> between the two. Much of the focus of psychology of religion is concerned with issues that wouldn't be considered 'transcendent' within transpersonal psychology, so the two disciplines do have quite a distinct focus.|$|E
50|$|Further intervenors, {{including}} several major commercial radio companies, {{indicated that the}} station's proposed format did not offer <b>a</b> sufficiently <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> from other commercial radio stations already broadcasting in the Toronto market.|$|R
5000|$|Faced with {{a growing}} {{identity}} crisis and continually dwindling numbers, Wesleyan-Holiness Evangelicals have hosted several inter-denominational conferences and begun several initiatives to draw <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> between Wesleyan theology and that of other Evangelicals and to explore how to address contemporary social issues and appear winsome to a [...] "post-modern world." [...] As one such example, in 2006 the Wesleyan Holiness Consortium published [...] "The Holiness Manifesto" [...] in conjunction with representatives from historic Holiness denominations.|$|R
50|$|Brad Bird {{also helped}} Silverman, {{particularly}} with Krusty's design. An early idea for The Simpsons saw Krusty the Clown being revealed as Homer Simpson's secret stage identity. This storyline never developed, but this episode allowed writers to comment upon the design similarity {{of the two}} characters. Krusty's appearance and design is just that of Homer's, with clown make-up. Silverman enhanced the lines under Krusty's eyes, and reshaped his beard line {{in order to make}} <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> between the two characters.|$|R
25|$|Similar to his predecessors, Herodotus {{also made}} mistakes. He {{accepted}} <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> between the civilized Greeks in {{the centre of}} the earth and the barbarians on the world's edges. In his Histories we can see very clearly that he believed that the world became stranger and stranger when one traveled away from Greece, until one reached the ends of the earth, where humans behaved as savages.|$|E
25|$|George {{reconciled}} {{the issues}} of efficiency and equity, showing that both could be satisfied under a system in harmony with natural law. He showed that Ricardo's Law of Rent applied not just to an agricultural economy, but even more so to urban economics. And he showed {{that there is no}} inherent conflict between labor and capital provided one maintained <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> between classical factors of production, capital and land.|$|E
25|$|Gautier's {{literary}} criticism was more reflective in nature; his literary analysis was {{free from the}} pressure of his art and theatre columns and therefore, {{he was able to}} express his ideas without restriction. He made <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> between prose and poetry, stating that prose should never be considered the equal of poetry. The bulk of Gautier's criticism, however, was journalistic. He raised the level of journalistic criticism of his day.|$|E
50|$|In the 18th century, {{under the}} {{influence}} of the Age of Enlightenment, the modern hospital began to appear, serving only medical needs and staffed with trained physicians and surgeons. The nurses were untrained workers. The goal was to use modern methods to cure patients. They provided more narrow medical services, and were founded by the secular authorities. <b>A</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> emerged between medicine and poor relief. Within the hospitals, acute cases were increasingly treated alone, and separate departments were set up for different categories of patient.|$|R
40|$|Using {{data from}} 69 {{in-depth}} interviews, the authors examine how men define financial planning and preretirement planning. The analyses show that younger men {{are less likely}} than older men to actively plan for retirement, and <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> is made between financial planning and preretire-ment planning. The results also show that the meanings of the two phrases overlap as one ages and that financial habits change over the life course. Understanding the changes over the life course would ensure that successful programs aim at securing financial security at older ages...|$|R
30|$|Burke and Stats (1998) {{advocated}} {{that social}} identity theory {{is having a}} greater emphasis on socio-cognitive processes, contextual responsiveness, group behaviour and intergroup relations and <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> between role and group. Social identity theory has concentrated on the causes and consequences of identifying with a social group or category and has focused more on the meaning associated with being a member of a social category. Again, Turner et al. (1994) have argued that because people defined themselves in terms of their social group membership and enact roles as part of their acceptance of the normative expectations of in group members.|$|R
