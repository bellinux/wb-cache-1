500|$|An {{alternative}} studio {{version of}} [...] "What Is Life" [...] – in fact, a rough {{mix of the}} original backing track with different orchestration (in this case, piccolo trumpet and oboe) – was issued as one of five bonus tracks on the 2001 remaster of All Things Must Pass. In the accompanying booklet, Harrison writes that this orchestral arrangement was discarded because he [...] "didn't like the feel". Speaking to Billboard editor-in-chief Timothy White in December 2000, Harrison explained {{the reason for the}} lack of a guide vocal on this version: [...] "I'm playing the fuzz guitar part that goes all through the song. So <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> on the [...] take was to give the band the cue line – the first line of each verse – and then go back to playing that riff. So that rough mix without the vocal – I'd forgot all about it …" [...] The track also appears on the 2014 Apple Years 1968–75 reissue of All Things Must Pass.|$|E
500|$|Whitlam {{trained as}} a {{navigator}} and bomb aimer, before serving with No. 13 Squadron RAAF, based mainly on the Gove Peninsula, Northern Territory, flying Lockheed Ventura bombers. He reached the rank of Flight Lieutenant. While in the service, he began his political activities, distributing literature for the Australian Labor Party during the 1943 federal election and urging {{the passage of the}} [...] "Fourteen Powers" [...] referendum of 1944, which would have expanded the powers of the federal government. [...] Although the party was victorious, the referendum it advocated was defeated. In 1961, Whitlam said of the referendum defeat, [...] "My hopes were dashed by the outcome and from that moment I determined to do <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to modernise the Australian Constitution." [...] While still in uniform, Whitlam joined the ALP in Sydney in 1945. He was discharged from the RAAF on 17 October 1945, and continued to use Air Force log books to record all of the flights he took until 2007. Whitlam completed his studies after the war, obtained his Bachelor of Laws, and was admitted to the federal and New South Wales bars in 1947.|$|E

500|$|When {{beginning}} {{work on her}} then-untitled third studio album, Stefani sought {{inspiration from}} her personal life in order to write lyrics for new material. She noted:... I was also in a really desperate place doing This Is What The Truth Feels Like, and I wasn’t back {{to a place of}} naiveté and purity. It was, 'All I have left right now is my music. And if I do that, maybe I’ll survive.' So, the way Tragic Kingdom was pure, this new record was pure. I was making this record because it’s <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to save my own life. She described this as a magical process. Immediately following the completion of [...] "Make Me Like You", Stefani wrote [...] "Misery" [...] with Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Mattias Larsson, and Robin Frediksson; however, unlike the recording sessions for her previous albums, the songwriting process was significantly shorter, which she opined was because everything should be simple. [...] "Misery" [...] was recorded by Mattias Larsson and Robin Frediksson of Mattman & Robin at Wolf Cousins Studios and Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, and at Interscope Studios in Santa Monica, California. Additional recording was handled by Juan Carlos Torrado and Noah Passovoy, while Serban Ghenea mixed the audio at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{departure}} from NASCAR Ambrose stated: [...] "I think I've accomplished all I can accomplish in NASCAR. When I came it was clear <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was win races and not have any chance at a championship. I've enjoyed my time here and I will miss my friends and the other drivers very much but this move is done mostly to help my children get raised in our native country and I feel like I {{want to start a}} new chapter in my life. I'm glad to leave with multiple wins in NASCAR and having raced for the King." ...|$|E
2500|$|May {{spoke about}} this {{incident}} years later, saying, [...] "the first thing I knew I was being fired {{on from the}} rear ... <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was try to dodge my attacker. I noticed it was a red tri-plane, but if I realized it was Richthofen, I would have probably {{passed out on the}} spot. I kept on dodging and spinning, I imagine from about 12,000 feet until I ran out of sky and had to hedge hop over the ground. Richthofen was firing at me continually, [...] the only thing that saved me was my poor flying. I didn't know what I was doing myself and I do not suppose that Richthofen could figure out what I was going to do".|$|E
60|$|<b>All</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> in {{comment was}} to sit down; {{and in the}} mean time the steamer trembled, groaned, choked, cleared its throat, and we were under way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Joe deliberated; [...] "that {{would be}} <b>all</b> right--if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it alone. But as for {{asking you to}} help me--why, that would be treason to French Pete." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{unnecessarily}} frank," [...] Clare {{answered with}} a blush. [...] "Since you couldn't steal away, wouldn't it have been better not to hint that I was anxious to avoid you? After <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> so if I had really wanted." ...|$|R
2500|$|Huckstepp {{also went}} {{to the media and}} gave {{extensive}} interviews, claiming that Rogerson had murdered Lanfranchi and stolen $10,000 Lanfranchi was carrying to bribe Rogerson. She also claimed that Neddy Smith had lied to the inquest and was involved in a conspiracy with Rogerson. Rogerson maintained his innocence. In Neddy: The Life and Crimes of Arthur Stanley Smith, Smith wrote that Lanfranchi was [...] "attempting to bribe Rogerson. I was the person that took Warren to this fatal meeting. There was an inquest and both sides threw plenty of shit at one another. I was {{right in the middle of}} it <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> nothing to bring Warren back to life, so I did the best thing I could. I know Warren’s family suffered deeply, but I cannot do anything about it." [...] He goes on to claim that as a result of his testimony at the inquest, Rogerson and other corrupt police officers gave him a [...] "green light" [...] to commit crime without fear of prosecution.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Resigned! What of that? I held my tongue! It was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do!</b> I {{never knew}} {{things could be}} worse till I saw it was killing him, and then <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was still to keep silence.' ...|$|E

60|$|I {{answered}} that I quite agreed with him, but that as my companions insisted upon making this journey, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not desert them. <b>All</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was to beg {{him to keep}} a sharp look-out {{so that he might}} be able to help us in case we got into trouble.|$|R
6000|$|... "My poor fellow," [...] said Charlie, {{in a tone}} of low but tender sympathy, [...] "I wish with <b>all</b> {{my heart}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> you any good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen, Holmes!" [...] There was a {{sound as}} if he was shaking the dying man, and it was <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to hold myself quiet in my hiding-place. [...] "You must hear me. You SHALL hear me. Do you {{remember}} a box--an ivory box? It came on Wednesday. You opened it--do you remember?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Looks {{as if we}} were snowed in {{good and}} proper," [...] {{returned}} another man. [...] "I wanted to get to one of those stores across the way, and I had about <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to make it. In one place I got into snow up to my waist, and it was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to get out of it." ...|$|E
60|$|Tho. Nay, I don't know, {{but in a}} fright it was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
60|$|I nodded my head again. It was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to {{keep myself}} {{standing}} upright.|$|E
60|$|June 15.--I laboured all the evening, {{but made}} little way. There were many books to consult; and so <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> really <b>do</b> {{was to make}} out my task of three pages. I {{will try to make}} up the deficit of Tuesday to-day and to-morrow. Letters from Walter--all well. A visit {{yesterday}} from Charles Sharpe.|$|R
60|$|He {{broke off}} and looked {{somewhat}} alarmed {{in the direction}} of the office door, from the other side of which there had just come a loud crash, followed by loud, if unintelligible, vituperation. What had happened <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not guess; <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was to carry off the situation as boldly as I dared.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dammy," [...] George {{said to a}} {{confidential}} friend, [...] "she looked like a China doll, which {{has nothing to do}} all day but to grin and wag its head. By Jove, Will, it was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to prevent myself from throwing the sofa-cushion at her." [...] He restrained that exhibition of sentiment, however.|$|R
60|$|I rode {{back with}} a heavy heart. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> now was to send {{the letter to the}} post-office, Stockholm.|$|E
6000|$|Plac. I {{must not}} farther by your prayers be won: [...] <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> I have already done. [...] [To her.|$|E
60|$|So I wilted {{right down}} {{on to the}} planks then, and give up; and it was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep from crying.|$|E
60|$|Once {{more the}} dragon was {{sweeping}} toward us, and {{so rapidly that}} I {{had no time to}} unsling my bow. <b>All</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was to snatch up a rock, and hurl it at the thing's hideous face. Again my aim was true, and with a hiss of pain and rage the reptile wheeled once more and soared away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes. Only {{look at the}} way he walks." [...] Mr. Van Wyk {{took him}} up in a {{perfectly}} cool and undoubting tone. [...] "The question, however, is whether your sense of duty does not carry you too far from your true interest. After <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> too <b>could</b> <b>do</b> something to serve you. You know who I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You did her no wrong. There was {{a motive}} {{which she was}} keeping from you. In {{revealing}} that motive, I reveal the painful secret {{which brings me to}} this house. <b>All</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to prepare you, I have done. Let me now tell the truth in the plainest and fewest words. When Mr. and Mrs. Vanstone left Combe-Raven, in the March of the present year--" ...|$|R
60|$|It was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{to keep a}} {{straight}} face. I'd {{a pretty good idea}} where she 'ad gorn; and it wasn't Dalston.|$|E
60|$|But now {{my voice}} was fainter. It was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to get my breath. The room swam round and round before my eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Then, {{in spite}} of <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep him, he went, muttering: [...] "Strange! Exceeding strange!" [...] and leaving me quite unfit for prayer.|$|E
6000|$|... "The result I fear {{you would}} {{scarcely}} consider satisfactory," [...] the Prince declared. [...] "The moment that I hinted at the existence of--er--conditions of which you, Duchess, are aware, he showed alarm, and <b>I</b> had <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to reassure him. I find it everywhere amongst your aristocracy--this stubborn {{confidence in the}} existence of the reigning order of things, this absolute detestation of anything approaching intrigue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is to be}} here on Monday. I haven't {{seen him}} for more than twelve years; and now he's to be here next week? Dear, dear! When I think {{sometimes}} of all the hard words that have been spoken, and the harder thoughts {{that have been in}} people's minds, I often regret that the money ever came to me at <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> without it, very well,--very well." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{already the}} call of duty was {{sounding}} in my ears, and these English, {{in spite of all the}} fraternity which exists among sportsmen, would certainly have made me prisoner. There was no hope for my mission now, and <b>I</b> had <b>done</b> <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see the lines of Massena's camp no very great distance off, for, by a lucky chance, the chase had taken us in that direction.|$|R
