He tells Archie to stay away from his girlfriend Stacey because she has said Archie raped her three months previously, and Bradley leaves. As Archie picks up his snowglobe from the floor, the bust of Queen Victoria is pushed from the bar and hits him on the head.|$|E

5|$|Arha's {{routine is}} {{disrupted}} by her {{discovery of a}} man (Ged, the protagonist of A Wizard of Earthsea) in the undertomb. She traps him in the labyrinth by slamming the door on him, and through a peephole sees him unsuccessfully attempt {{to open the door}} with a spell. Trapped in the labyrinth the man collapses out of exhaustion, and Arha has him chained up while debating what to do with him. After questioning him she learns that he has come to the Tombs looking for the long-lost half of the ring of Erreth-Akbe, a magical talisman, broken centuries before, necessary for peace in Earthsea.

25|$|The book {{takes the}} form of an edition of the play The Tragedy of Arthur, along with an {{extensive}} introduction and footnotes by Phillips, and additional notes by the publishers who argue for the play's authenticity.

25|$|At {{the time}} when his third book was brought out he had retired {{for a short time}} to Cisalpine Gaul, in weariness, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> us, of his {{unprofitable}} attendance to the bigwigs of Rome. For a time he seems to have felt the charm of the new scenes which he visited, and in a later book (iv. 25) he contemplates the prospect of retiring to the neighbourhood of Aquileia and the Timavus. But the spell exercised over him by Rome and Roman society was too great; even the epigrams sent from Forum Corneli and the Aemilian Way ring much more of the Roman forum, and of the streets, baths, porticos, brothels, market stalls, public houses, and clubs of Rome, than of the places from which they are dated.|$|E
25|$|In {{the future}} storyline where the Sentinels exterminated most mutants {{and went on}} to kill regular humans as well, the elderly Magneto allies with the X-Men's {{remnants}} in a monastery in China.

Wolverine's consciousness is sent back to his past self by Kitty Pryde, and his past actions occur simultaneously to an incoming Sentinel attack on the mutant hideout. Magneto destroys many Sentinels by hurling the Blackbird at them but ends up impaled by a stray fragment from a destroyed Sentinel. Retreating into the monastery, Magneto starts to succumb to his wound <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> Charles he regrets that both friends spent too many years fighting among themselves rather than seeing eye-to-eye. He remains there until the Sentinels infiltrate the stronghold right as young Xavier and Wolverine have successfully changed the future.|$|E

He may begin a day with a celebratory rack of ribs, because [...] "I'm feelin' hungry today!", and he depicts his life with meat metaphors. For example, he describes the White House Chief of Staff with grudging admiration: [...] "She’s as tough as a two-dollar steak" [...] and plans to destroy an enemy the way [...] "you devour a whale. One bite at a time". He also endures a tedious weekly meeting with House leaders, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> the audience, by [...] " [...] their lightly salted faces frying in a skillet." ...|$|E

After traveling to Pulse, Sazh eventually forgives Fang for what happened to Dajh. After Vanille and Fang transform to Ragnarok and prevent Cocoon from colliding with Pulse, Sazh is reunited with Dajh.|$|E
500|$|A {{sword is}} forged by a blacksmith, who then shows {{it to his}} young son, Conan, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> him of the [...] "Riddle of Steel", an aphorism on the {{importance}} of the metal to their people, the Cimmerians. One day, the Cimmerians are massacred by a band of raiders led by Thulsa Doom; Conan's father is killed by dogs, and his sword is taken by Doom to decapitate Conan's mother, aided by Doom's entrancing gaze. The children are taken into slavery and then chained to work a large mill, the Wheel of Pain. [...] Conan survives into adulthood, becoming a massive, muscular man. [...] His master eventually trains him to be a gladiator; after winning countless fights and receiving training and education in the East, Conan is freed.

Jack {{hopes that}} bringing Tracy along {{can help him}} get close to GE CEO Don Geiss (Rip Torn). At the event, Tracy becomes the hit of the party, but quickly begins {{to feel that the}} reason he was brought along was to be [...] "the funny black man". Tracy insults Geiss by accusing him of not hiring more black people, which results in Tracy and Jack not being invited to golf along with Geiss. Jack blames Tracy for this, but Tracy doesn't care, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> Jack that he cannot help but drop [...] "truth bombs". Later, to make amends with both Jack and Geiss, Tracy gives a heartfelt speech about his daughter battling diabetes, which moves Geiss.

In Shiloh (1952) Foote foreshadows his use of historical narrative <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> the story of the bloodiest battle in American history to that point from the first-person perspective of seven different characters. The narrative is presented by 17 characters – Confederate soldiers Metcalf, Dade, and Polly; and Union soldiers Fountain, Flickner, with each of the twelve named soldiers in the Indiana squad given one section of that chapter. A close reading of this work reveals a very complete interlocked picture of the characters connecting with each other (Union with Union, Confederate with Confederate).|$|E

[...] All (six) centurions of the fourth cohort were dead, its standard bearer killed and the standard missing. [...] Of the remaining cohorts, almost all the centurions were either wounded or killed; Baculus, the legion’s primipilus, a fine soldier, had received so many minor and serious wounds that he could barely stand. The Nervii were attacking vigorously from lower ground and pressing at the front and both flanks. [...] Caesar could see some men were shirking and {{trying to get to the}} rear; others were slowly ceasing effective resistance. There were no reserves. This was the crisis-point. [...] He took a shield from a soldier at the rear and {{went to the}} first line. [...] Calling his centurions by name, he ordered them to have the soldiers advance (signa inferre) and the maniples open up and extend. [...] <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> it, his arrival brought hope and boosted the soldiers’ morale. Every man was now keen to do well in front of his general.
