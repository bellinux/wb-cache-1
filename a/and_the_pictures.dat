It's a spatial congruent example by combining visual and auditory stimuli. On the other hand, the sound <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> of a TV program would be integrated as structural congruent by combining visual and auditory stimuli. However, if the sound <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> were not meaningfully fit, we would segregate the two stimuli. Therefore, whether spatial or structural congruent should not only combine the stimuli but also be determined by understanding.|$|E

50|$|The enamel plaques on the {{circular}} band, the panel depicting Christ Pantokrator, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> of Emperor Michael were all {{affixed to the}} crown using different techniques. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> of <b>the</b> emperor could not {{be attached to the}} rim {{in the same way as}} <b>the</b> Pantokrator <b>picture</b> on <b>the</b> front. The frame was folded upwards <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> of <b>the</b> emperor was nailed to the edge.

MacDonald, Professor of English at New Mexico State University {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter points out that {{although}} Potter regarded the lives of her father and his friends as comical and even beneath notice, yet she clearly respected and valued their outdoor pursuits from the bemused treatment she accorded them in Jeremy Fisher. She valued nature untouched by humans even more, MacDonald notes, {{as evidenced by the}} careful observation in the illustrations. Jeremy Fisher was written without the many revisions typical of Potter's other productions, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> appear effortless in their execution. MacDonald writes, [...] "Her ability to show human society without also implying its damaging effects on flora and fauna further underscores the book's felicitous composition and success".|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Palmetto Family, a {{conservative}} South Carolina group affiliated with Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council, challenged {{the inclusion of}} Fun Home as a reading selection for incoming freshmen at the College of Charleston. Palmetto Family president Oran Smith called the book [...] "pornographic". Bechdel disputed this, saying that pornography is designed to cause sexual arousal, {{which is not the}} purpose of her book. College provost George Hynd and associate provost Lynne Ford defended the choice of Fun Home, pointing out that its themes of identity are especially appropriate for college freshmen. However, seven months later, the Republican-led South Carolina House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee cut the college's funding by $52,000, the cost of the summer reading program, to punish the college for selecting Fun Home. Rep. Garry Smith, who proposed the cuts, said that in choosing Fun Home the university was [...] "promoting the gay and lesbian lifestyle". Rep. Stephen Goldfinch, another supporter of the cuts, said, [...] "This book trampled on freedom of conservatives. ... Teaching with this book, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures,</b> goes too far." [...] Bechdel called the funding cut [...] "sad and absurd" [...] and pointed out that Fun Home [...] "is after all about the toll that this sort of small-mindedness takes on people's lives." [...] The full state House of Representatives subsequently voted to retain the cuts. College of Charleston students and faculty reacted with dismay and protests to the proposed cuts, and the college's Student Government Association unanimously passed a resolution urging that the funding be restored. A coalition of ten free-speech organizations {{wrote a letter to the}} South Carolina Senate Finance Committee, urging them to restore the funds and warning them that [...] "enalising state educational institutions financially simply because members of the legislature disapprove of specific elements of the educational program is educationally unsound and constitutionally suspect". The letter was co-signed by the National Coalition Against Censorship, the ACLU of South Carolina, the American Association of University Professors, the Modern Language Association, the Association of College and Research Libraries, the American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression, the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, the Association of American Publishers, the National Council of Teachers of English and the American Library Association. After a nearly week-long debate in which Fun Home and Bechdel were compared to slavery, Charles Manson and Adolf Hitler, the state Senate voted to restore the funding, but redirect the funds towards study of the United States Constitution and The Federalist Papers; the university was also required to provide alternate books to students who object to an assignment due to a [...] "religious, moral or cultural belief". Governor Nikki Haley approved the budget measure penalizing the university.|$|E
2500|$|Complex {{analysis}} {{is one of}} the classical branches in mathematics, with roots in the 19th century and just prior. Important mathematicians associated with complex analysis include Euler, Gauss, Riemann, Cauchy, Weierstrass, and many more in the 20th century. Complex analysis, in particular the theory of conformal mappings, has many physical applications and is also used throughout analytic number theory. In modern times, it has become very popular through a new boost from complex dynamics <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> of fractals produced by iterating holomorphic functions. [...] Another important application of complex {{analysis is}} in string theory which studies conformal invariants in quantum field theory.|$|E

In many countries it is required, on taking an oath, as the highest assertion that the witness would be speaking the truth. Nyrop notes that [...] "as a last act of charity, the image of the Redeemer is handed to the dying or death-condemned to be kissed." [...] Kissing the Cross brings blessing and happiness; people kiss the image of Our Lady <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> and statues of saintsânot only their pictures, [...] "but even their relics are kissed," [...] notes Nyrop.

2500|$|In December 2012, the {{psychiatrist}} Dr David OâFlynn, at a gallery talk at {{an exhibition of}} the Kaleidoscopic Cats at the Bethlem Royal Hospital Archives & Museum, proposed viewing the series as the creation of two men, [...] "Louis Wain, who created them, and Walter Maclay (1902â1964), {{the psychiatrist}} who organised them into a series" [...] (...) [...] O'Flynn suggests Maclay saw in the series a proof of his ideas â partly based on his 1930s experiments with art and mescaline-induced psychosis â that the creative ability of people with schizophrenia deteriorated. But the experience of outsider art {{is that this is}} not true. Looking at Wain's late work, O'Flynn sees a greater experimentation and use of colour â but not a deterioration. Despite the series being known to be assembled, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> not dated since the 1960s, [...] "their representation of something that doesn't exist, namely psychotic deterioration, has been surprisingly robust". The series has become [...] "the Mona Lisa of asylum art".|$|E
2500|$|On 20 December 2004, Strathfield council's mayor, Alfred Tsang {{stepped down}} over {{allegations}} of corruption.

However, {{it was not clear}} why the money was given to him, though it was alleged that he was talking to Mr Saklawi about the redevelopment of an [...] council-owned carpark. Tsang had previously released a statement that [...] "Councils need to take leadership roles in this area, we simply cannot continue to support unsustainable development, {{for the sake of our}} children, grandchildren and the future environment, we need to make changes now." [...] According to The Australian Tsang was heard to have said that [...] "Basically, we get it for nothing,..... I am making Strathfield a better place ... I am doing it for the area." [...] Strathfield council soon afterwards released a press statement that it [...] "will not and does not" [...] tolerate misconduct. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is currently investigating whether claims developers were given inside information about land rezoning proposals put to Strathfield Council have any substance <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> taken by The Australian were handed to them for further investigation.|$|E

2500|$|In the 16th century {{an attempt}} to print erotic {{material}} caused a scandal when the well-known Italian artist Marcantonio Raimondi published I Modi in 1524, an illustrated book of 16 [...] "postures" [...] or sexual positions. Raimondi was subsequently imprisoned by the Pope Clement VII and all copies of the illustrations were destroyed. Raimondi based the engravings {{on a series of}} erotic paintings that Giulio Romano was doing as a commission for the Palazzo del Te in Mantua. Though the two depictions were very similar, only Raimondi was prosecuted because his engravings were capable of being seen by the public. Romano did not know of the engravings until Pietro Aretino came to see the original paintings while Romano was still working on them. Aretino then composed sixteen explicit sonnets ("both in your cunt and your behind, my prick will make me happy, and you happy and blissful") to go with the paintings and secured Raimondi's release from prison. [...] I Modi was then published a second time in 1527, with the poems <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures,</b> making this the first time erotic text and images were combined, though the papacy once more seized all the copies it could find. Raimondi escaped prison that time, but the censorship was so strict that no complete editions of the original printings have ever been found. The text in existence is only a copy of a copy that was discovered 400 years later.|$|E
2500|$|Those {{who were}} {{involved}} in the NATO airstrikes have stood by the decision to take such action. U.S President Bill Clinton's Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, said, [...] "The appalling accounts of mass killing in Kosovo <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> of refugees fleeing Serb oppression for their lives makes it clear that this is a fight for justice over genocide." [...] On CBS' Face the Nation Cohen claimed, [...] "We've now seen about 100,000 military-aged men missing. ... They may have been murdered." [...] Clinton, citing the same figure, spoke of [...] "at least 100,000 (Kosovar Albanians) missing". Later, Clinton said about Yugoslav elections, [...] "they're going to have to come to grips with what Mr. MiloÅ¡eviÄ ordered in Kosovo. ... They're going to have to decide whether they support his leadership or not; whether they think it's OK that all those tens of thousands of people were killed. ..." [...] In the same press conference, Clinton also claimed [...] "NATO stopped deliberate, systematic efforts at ethnic cleansing and genocide." [...] Clinton compared the events of Kosovo to the Holocaust. CNN reported, [...] "Accusing Serbia of 'ethnic cleansing' in Kosovo similar to the genocide of Jews in World War II, an impassioned Clinton sought Tuesday to rally public support for his decision to send U.S. forces into combat against Yugoslavia, a prospect that seemed increasingly likely with the breakdown of a diplomatic peace effort." [...] President Clinton's State Department also claimed Serbian troops had committed genocide. The New York Times reported, [...] "the Administration said evidence of 'genocide' by Serbian forces was growing to include 'abhorrent and criminal action' on a vast scale. The language was the State Department's strongest up to that time in denouncing Yugoslav President Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ." [...] The State Department also gave the highest estimate of dead Albanians. In May 1996, Defense Secretary William Cohen suggested that there might be up to 100,000 Albanian fatalities." ...|$|E
