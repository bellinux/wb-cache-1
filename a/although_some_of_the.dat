5|$|Although {{the site}} was {{restored}} during the archaeological investigations, it suffered considerable damage in the 1976 Guatemala earthquake. This resulted in destruction {{of some of the}} restoration work, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damage has now been repaired.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seamounts in the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain {{appear to}} follow the {{expected}} age progression for a mantle plume trail, others, such as Denson Seamount, are older than that hypothesis would suggest. As a result, the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain has also been proposed by geoscientists to be a mix of ridge and mantle plume volcanism.|$|E

50|$|According to Pseudomonarchia Daemonum he is <b>the</b> King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West, <b>although</b> for <b>some</b> {{translations}} <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Lesser Key <b>of</b> Solomon he is King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East (<b>Although</b> <b>some</b> translations <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Lesser Key <b>of</b> Solomon consider Belial, Beleth, Asmodai and Gaap kings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four cardinal directions, {{though not}} giving detail on the cardinal point each rule).|$|R
5|$|Although {{theoretically}} a collegial body operating through consensus building, Gaddafi {{dominated the}} RCC, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> others attempted to constrain {{what they saw}} as his excesses. Gaddafi remained the government's public face, with the identities of the other RCC members only being publicly revealed on 10 January 1970. All young men from (typically rural) working and middle-class backgrounds, none had university degrees; in this way they were distinct from the wealthy, highly educated conservatives who previously governed the country.|$|E
5|$|During the Antarctic {{winter of}} 1902 Discovery became {{locked in the}} ice. Efforts to free her {{during the summer of}} 1902–03 failed, and <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expedition's members (including Ernest Shackleton) left in a relief ship, Crean and the {{majority}} of the party remained in the Antarctic until the ship was finally freed in February 1904. After returning to regular naval duty, Crean was promoted to petty officer, first class, on Scott's recommendation.|$|E
5|$|The program ran {{until the}} 1970s, {{but by the}} late 1960s, {{it was clear that}} {{discrimination}} of decoys was an unsolved problem, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> techniques developed might still be useful against less sophisticated decoys. This work appears {{to be one of the}} main reasons that the thin defense of I-67 was considered worthwhile. At that time, in 1967, ARPA passed the PRESS radars to the Army.|$|E

5|$|Three dams {{were built}} {{from the island}} to the mainland. The center dam divided the dock area in half, another was further west and a third dam {{extended}} east across {{what would be the}} entrance. The two outer dams completely closed off the site from the sea. The center dam was built without much difficulty by simply tipping material to form an embankment, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth sank into the mud, so more had to be added.|$|E
5|$|Traffic is a 2000 American crime drama film {{directed}} by Steven Soderbergh and written by Stephen Gaghan. It explores the illegal drug trade {{from a number}} of perspectives: users, enforcers, politicians, and traffickers. Their stories are edited together throughout the film, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters do not meet each other. The film is an adaptation of the 1989 British Channel 4 television series Traffik.|$|E
5|$|A PlayStation 3 {{version of}} Oblivion was {{released}} on March 20, 2007 in North America, and April 27, 2007 in Europe, following delays similar to those for the Xbox 360 release. The PlayStation 3 release was touted for its improvement over the graphics of the PC and Xbox 360 versions, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> improved shader routines optimized for the PlayStation 3 release were set to be ported {{over to the other}} releases through patches. A plan to distribute content through downloads paid by micropayment was initially met with criticism by customers due to its alleged low value, but later releases—at a reduced price, and with more content—proved more popular.|$|E

5|$|After a {{few weeks}} {{assigned}} to Western Approaches Command, the 1st DF {{was assigned to the}} Nore Command at Harwich, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ships were transferred to the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla, where they were tasked for escort and patrol duty. Gipsy was sunk on 21 November after she struck a mine, as did Grenville on 19 January 1940. Unlike the 1st DF, the Second was transferred to Force K in Freetown in West Africa, to help search for German commerce raiders. Some ships were later transferred to Bermuda and the West Indies for escort work and patrolling. They returned to the UK in January and spent several months refitting.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of construction, the {{railways}} provided a leap in transport for the communities it passed through. NSB saw beautiful and grandeur stations {{as a way to}} draw patronage, and chose, in addition to impressive architecture, to build a park adjacent each stations. As construction went by, funding for stations were reduced, resulting in less grandeur further north. Most stations had two stories and an attic, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stations serving lesser places had smaller buildings. From Steinkjer to Skogn, the ground floors were built in random rubble. As construction continued, budgets were reduced and station costs were cut. From Rinnan to Sparbu, the ground floors were instead built in brick, and from Mære and north, the stations have wooden ground floors. In addition to a station buildings, stations consisted of an outhouse and a freight house; selected stations also featured a water tower and motive power depot.|$|E
5|$|Batman Forever {{went through}} a few major edits before its release. Originally darker than the final product, the movie's {{original}} length was closer to 2 hours and 40 minutes according to director Joel Schumacher. There was talk of an extended cut being released to DVD for the film's 10th anniversary in 2005. While all four previous Batman films were given special edition DVD releases {{on the same day}} as the Batman Begins DVD release, none of them were given extended cuts, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following scenes were in a deleted scenes section in the special features.|$|E

5|$|By William's death, after {{weathering}} {{a series}} of rebellions, most of the native Anglo-Saxon aristocracy {{had been replaced by}} Norman and other continental magnates. Not all of the Normans who accompanied William in the initial conquest acquired large amounts of land in England. Some appear to have been reluctant to take up lands in a kingdom that did not always appear pacified. <b>Although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newly rich Normans in England came from William's close family or from the upper Norman nobility, others were from relatively humble backgrounds. William granted some lands to his continental followers from the holdings of one or more specific Englishmen; at other times, he granted a compact grouping of lands previously held by many different Englishmen to one Norman follower, often to allow for the consolidation of lands around a strategically placed castle.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Bankhead was {{replaced}} by Lieutenant Colonel William S. Harney in 1839. Colonel Harney had two earlier encounters with Seminoles, the first a battle in which Chief Arpeika eluded capture, and a second in which Harney escaped in only his shirt and drawers from an early morning attack (the Harney Massacre) on his camp led by Chief Chakaika. In light of these experiences, Harney instituted an intensive training program in swamp and jungle warfare for his men. After Chakaika led the raid on Indian Key in August 1840, Harney set out into the Everglades after Chakaika, and killed him in his own camp. The war quieted down after that, with active pursuit of the Seminoles ending in 1842, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seminoles remained hidden in the Everglades.|$|E
5|$|Few {{vocabulary}} {{items are}} considered unique to Ottawa. The influx of speakers of other Ojibwe dialects into the Ottawa area {{has resulted in}} mixing of dialects that were historically distinct. Given that vocabulary spreads readily from one dialect to another {{the presence of a}} particular vocabulary item in a given dialect is not a guarantee of the original source of the item. Two groups of function words are characteristically Ottawa: the sets of demonstrative pronouns and interrogative adverbs are both distinctive relative to other dialects of Ojibwe. <b>Although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vocabulary items in each set are found in other dialects, taken as a group each is uniquely Ottawa.|$|E
50|$|The docks {{were served}} by a myriad of {{dockside}} lines which fell out <b>of</b> use during <b>the</b> 1990s <b>although</b> <b>some</b> remnants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dockside lines are still evident today.|$|R
50|$|<b>Although</b> <b>some</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Society for Cryobiology {{encouraged}} or {{helped in}} <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> early-stage cryonics in the 1960s, the Society later on banned cryonicists from becoming members.|$|R

5|$|In 1538 the Abbey {{with all}} land and {{possessions}} was surrendered by the monks to Henry VIII {{in the course}} of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The main buildings of the abbey were then demolished, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decorative floor tiles were relaid in the neighbouring Church of St Peter and St Paul. The whole property and advowson was then granted to Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, later 1st Duke of Somerset. On his execution in 1552 it reverted to The Crown. Stone from the abbey was used in many of the local buildings. In 1872 when collecting stone labourers found a blue stone coffin lid under which the pavement of the 14th century lady chapel was uncovered. In 1924 a pageant was held at the site, involving around 500 people, representing the history of the abbey from its foundation to the dissolution.|$|E
5|$|In 1638, the Santa Margherita Lines {{began to}} be built {{encircling}} the land fronts of Birgu and Sengela. Works were suspended in 1645 {{due to a lack}} of funds, and they remained unfinished for many years. Following the fall of Candia to the Ottomans in 1669, a second line of fortifications, the Cottonera Lines, {{began to be}} built encircling both Birgu and Senglea, as well as the unfinished Santa Margherita Lines. They were begun in 1670, but works stopped in 1680 again {{due to a lack of}} funds. By this time, the bastioned enceinte had been built, although other crucial parts had not yet been constructed. Eventually, some effort was done to complete both the Santa Margherita and Cottonera Lines in the early 18th century, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planned ravelins, cavaliers, ditch and other fortifications were never constructed. Fort San Salvatore was built on one of the Cottonera Lines bastions in 1724.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, the British Transport Commission, {{together}} with the British Iron and Steel Federation and Sheffield Chamber of Commerce considered plans to upgrade the navigation to handle 250-tonne barges, and work started on new wharfs and warehouses at Rotherham. Control of the navigation passed on again in 1963, this time to the British Waterways Board, who submitted a proposal to the government for a £2.5million upgrade, covering the stretch from Bramwith to Rotherham. This would have involved the construction of ten new locks, each , to replace the existing 12 locks. The new main line would then {{have been the same}} size as the Aire and Calder Navigation, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridges would have had less clearance. In 1972, a further proposal for a £2million scheme to upgrade the waterway to handle 700-tonne barges up to Mexborough, and 400-tonne barges from there to Rotherham was submitted to the Department of the Environment.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, the Gaullist RPR and the Union for French Democracy {{merged into}} the Union for a Popular Movement(UPM), <b>although</b> <b>some</b> {{elements}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old UDF remained outside the new alliance.|$|R
