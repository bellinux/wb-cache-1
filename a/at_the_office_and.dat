500|$|Andy Buckley, who portrayed David Wallace, former CFO of Dunder Mifflin, was {{originally}} {{billed as a}} guest star for this episode and his character {{was supposed to have}} a part in Michael's movie. When NBC first aired the episode, Wallace's scenes were not shown. It was revealed by Novak that, in the script, Wallace was Michael's first choice as Goldenface, but turned it down because [...] "it wouldn't look good to people at Corporate". Furthermore, Buckley filmed a talking head interview, which had his character exclaiming his regret in not taking the role. This scene was deleted due to time constraints. The scene does not appear on the Season 7 DVD. [...] The script also had a scene that brought back Amy Adams' character Katy, but it was cut because Adams was working on a movie during the time this episode was filmed. Ellie Kemper, who portrays Erin Hannon on the series, did not appear in the movie; Novak reasoned that Michael had finished his filming long before she arrived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>office,</b> <b>and</b> had spent the remaining years [...] "editing and procrastinating".|$|E

500|$|Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{has been}} {{assigned}} {{to set up the}} Halloween party by Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who wants {{to live up to the}} expectations set by Robert California (James Spader). Robert arrives with his son Bert (David Mazouz) and remarks that the party is more tailored to kids than adults. In response, Andy asks Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) to take over and re-tailor the party, much to Erin's chagrin. Andy also tells her that he wishes to speak with her at the end of the day. Worried that he intends to fire her, she asks Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) to help her make the party more [...] "scary" [...] and [...] "sexy", and he gives her a tape to show everyone. Gabe explains to the camera crew that the video is a Cinema of the Unsettling movie, an avant garde film genre defined by its disturbing images and absence of plot. Disgusted by the video, the office staff demand an explanation from Erin. In desperation, she shows them her idea for making the party more [...] "sexy": a card game with photos of genitalia. This only makes them more outraged, and Andy and Robert talk with Erin in his office regarding the incident. Erin admits her fears about their planned talk at the end of the day. Andy tells her what he wanted to talk to her about: he has reached a point in his romantic relationship where his girlfriend should be able to call him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>office,</b> <b>and</b> that he wanted to clear this with Erin first since she handles all calls. Erin had not even known that he was dating someone, and is shocked to hear they have been out on 31 dates so far. Erin feels dejected and leaves.|$|E

In wire reports published as early as 11 October, Beatles press officer Derek Taylor responded to the rumour saying, [...] "Recently we've been getting a flood of inquiries asking about reports that Paul is dead.
