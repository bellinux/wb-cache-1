25|$|Substances {{containing}} alkyl nitrites {{other than}} <b>amyl</b> <b>nitrite</b> {{are available at}} many retailers—typically sex shops and stores that sell recreational-drug paraphernalia—and may be purchased legally.|$|E
25|$|It {{is illegal}} to sell poppers as inhalants in Australia, {{although}} some, including <b>amyl</b> <b>nitrite,</b> are often sold in sex shops misleadingly labeled as DVD or leather cleaner.|$|E
25|$|Most widely sold {{products}} {{include the}} original <b>amyl</b> <b>nitrite</b> (isoamyl nitrite, isopentyl nitrite), but also variants such as, isobutyl nitrite, isopropyl nitrite (2-propyl nitrite, increasingly, after EU ban of the isobutyl form). In some countries, to evade anti-drug laws, poppers are packaged labelled as room deodorizers, leather polish or tape head cleaner.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amyl</b> <b>nitrites</b> {{are also}} useful as {{reagents}} in {{a modification of}} the Sandmeyer reaction. The reaction of the alkyl nitrite with an aromatic amine in a halogenated solvent produces a radical aromatic species, this then frees a halogen atom from the solvent. For the synthesis of aryl iodides diiodomethane is used, whereas bromoform is the solvent of choice for the synthesis of aryl bromides.|$|R
40|$|Hispanic men {{who have}} sex with men (MSM) are at high risk of HIV infection. This study reports on the club drug use and sexual {{behaviors}} of two distinct samples (community and Internet) of Hispanic MSM living in the AIDS epicenter of Miami-Dade County. Both samples reported high rates of unprotected anal sex and high numbers of sex partners; rates of club drug use (cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamines, GHB, <b>amyl</b> <b>nitrites,</b> and Viagra) were also high. Recent use of club drugs was associated with both unprotected receptive and insertive anal sex in the Internet sample, but not in the community sample. Implications for social work practice are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Swallowing poppers (rather than {{inhaling the}} vapour) may cause cyanosis, unconsciousness, coma, and {{complications}} leading to death. Methemoglobinemia can occur if poppers have been swallowed. Accidental aspiration of <b>amyl</b> or butyl <b>nitrites</b> may cause lipoid pneumonia.|$|R
25|$|The French chemist Antoine Jérôme Balard {{synthesized}} <b>amyl</b> <b>nitrite</b> In 1844. Sir Thomas Lauder Brunton, a Scottish physician born in {{the year}} of amyl nitrite's first synthesis, famously pioneered its use to treat angina pectoris. Brunton was inspired by earlier work with the same agent, performed by Arthur Gamgee and Benjamin Ward Richardson. Brunton reasoned that the angina sufferer's pain and discomfort could be reduced by administering amyl nitrite—to dilate the coronary arteries of patients, thus improving blood flow to the heart muscle.|$|E
25|$|In mammals {{including}} humans, {{nitric oxide}} {{is an important}} cellular signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. It is a powerful vasodilator with a short half-life of a few seconds in the blood. Long-known pharmaceuticals such as nitroglycerine and <b>amyl</b> <b>nitrite</b> {{were found to be}} precursors to nitric oxide more than a century after their first use in medicine. Low levels of nitric oxide production are important in protecting organs such as the liver from ischemic damage. Nitric oxide production is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and is essential for hepatic lipid metabolism under starvation.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of nitric oxide is elevated in populations living at high altitudes, which helps these people avoid hypoxia by aiding in pulmonary vasculature vasodilation. Effects include vasodilatation, neurotransmission (see gasotransmitters), modulation {{of the hair}} cycle, {{production of}} reactive nitrogen intermediates and penile erections (through its ability to vasodilate). Nitroglycerin and <b>amyl</b> <b>nitrite</b> serve as vasodilators because they are converted to nitric oxide in the body. The vasodilating antihypertensive drug minoxidil contains an ·NO moiety and may act as an NO agonist. Likewise, Sildenafil citrate, popularly known by the trade name Viagra, stimulates erections primarily by enhancing signaling through the nitric oxide pathway in the penis.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} filming, {{in early}} February 1964, Sellers met Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi. On 19 February 1964, just ten days after their first meeting, the couple married. Sellers soon showed signs of {{insecurity}} and paranoia; he would become highly anxious and jealous, for example, when Ekland starred opposite attractive men. Shortly after the wedding, Sellers started filming on location in Twentynine Palms, California for Billy Wilder's Kiss Me, Stupid, opposite Dean Martin and Kim Novak. The relationship between Wilder and Sellers became strained; both had different approaches to work and often clashed as a result. On the night of 5 April 1964, prior to having sex with Ekland, Sellers inhaled <b>amyl</b> <b>nitrites</b> (poppers) as a sexual stimulant in his search for [...] "the ultimate orgasm", and suffered a series of eight heart attacks {{over the course of}} three hours as a result. His illness forced him to withdraw from the filming of Kiss Me, Stupid and he was replaced by Ray Walston. Wilder was unsympathetic about the heart attacks, saying that [...] "you have to have a heart before you can have an attack".|$|R
40|$|The Internet {{presents}} {{unique and}} growing opportunities for conducting HIV/ STD research. This article {{reports on the}} first 171 participants enrolled in an ongoing study examining use of the Internet to recruit Hispanic {{men who have sex}} with men (HMSM) living in an AIDS epicenter to participate in community-based studies. First, it describes initial success with chatroom recruitment. Second, it compares the demographic, psychosocial, and sexual risk practices among HMSM recruited through the Internet who had used club drugs in the last 6 months and those who had not. In 2 months, 211 hours were spent recruiting in chatrooms; 735 chatroom users were engaged. Researchers used a scripted dialogue to describe the study and to invite chatroom users to visit the study’s community sites for screening and enrollment. One hundred and seventy-six men came to the community sites; 172 (98 %) were eligible and completed an audio-computer assisted self-interview. In the last 6 months, 48. 5 % of the sample had used club drugs [defined as cocaine, crystal methamphetamines (crystal), <b>amyl</b> <b>nitrites</b> (poppers), Ecstasy, gammahydroxybutyrate (GHB), ketamine (Special K), and Viagra]. The proportion of men reporting use of each drug was: cocaine (15. 8 %), crystal (11. 7 %), poppers (31. 6 %), Ecstasy (14 %), GHB (3. 5 %), Special K (3. 5 %), and Viagra (19. 3 %). In multivariate analyses, having higher number of sex partners, having higher social isolation scores, and having engaged in unprotected receptive anal intercourse were significantly associated with club-drug use. These initial findings suggest that high-risk HMSM can be successfully recruited through chatroom dialogues to participate in community-based HIV studies. The alarmingly high rates of club-drug use and risky sexual practices among HMSM underscore the need for effective HIV preventive interventions for this population...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 03 Background: In Peru, the HIV {{epidemic}} is concentrated among {{men who have}} sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) in whom HIV incidence rates are as high as 4. 2 per 100 person-years with HIV prevalence reported to be as high as 22 % in MSM and up to 30 % in TGW. This dissertation seeks to add to the knowledge of the structure of sexual networks, namely the level and predictors of sexual concurrency among MSM and TGW in Peru (Aim 1), and the understanding of risk factors for HIV acquisition in MSM and TGW with high levels of substance use in Lima (Aim 2). Methods: Data are from the 2011 Peruvian Biobehavioral Surveillance survey (Aim 1) and the Sabes cohort study conducted in Lima from 2013 - 2016 (Aim 2). Data were collected with the computer assisted self-interview (CASI) (Aim 1 & 2); HIV testing was performed with Determine 1 / 2 rapid antibody tests (Aim 1 & 2), pooled nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), and Western Blot to determine Fiebig Stage at HIV diagnosis. Statistical methods used include Poisson regression and generalized estimating equations (GEE) (Aim 1), and Pearson’s Chi-square, Poisson regression estimated with GEE, and stratified Cox proportional hazards survival analysis with time-varying covariates (Aim 2). Results: Concurrency is a common practice among MSM and TGW in Peru with a 3 -month cumulative prevalence of over 23 %. There was evidence of negotiated safety—those with a stable partner were less likely to have condomless anal intercourse (CLAI) with a concurrent non-stable partner. In the Sabes cohort, HIV incidence was 11. 7 per 100 person-years of follow-up. Those with alcohol use disorders (AUD) were significantly more likely to attend a venue that served alcohol, binge drink, and use marijuana or <b>amyl</b> <b>nitrites.</b> AUD modified the association between the time-varying behavioral factors and HIV; behavioral risk factors (binge drinking, marijuana use, sex with a casual partner, client, or one-time partner) were most strongly associated with HIV acquisition amongst those with dependent drinking patterns. Conclusion: This study suggests that AUD is linked to HIV risk in two important ways: first, through CLAI with non-stable partners and second, through amplifying the impact of other HIV risk behaviors. These studies suggest that harm reduction approaches, such as negotiated safety with concurrent partners, and treatment of AUDs to decrease alcohol intake could decrease the HIV risk associated with these behaviors...|$|R
25|$|An older cyanide {{antidote}} kit included {{administration of}} three substances: <b>amyl</b> <b>nitrite</b> pearls (administered by inhalation), sodium nitrite, and sodium thiosulfate. The {{goal of the}} antidote was to generate a large pool of ferric iron (Fe3+) to compete for cyanide with cytochrome a3 (so that cyanide will bind to the antidote rather than the enzyme). The nitrites oxidize hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which competes with cytochrome oxidase for the cyanide ion. Cyanmethemoglobin is formed and the cytochrome oxidase enzyme is restored. The major mechanism to remove the cyanide from the body is by enzymatic conversion to thiocyanate by the mitochondrial enzyme rhodanese. Thiocyanate is a relatively non-toxic molecule and is excreted by the kidneys. To accelerate this detoxification, sodium thiosulfate is administered to provide a sulfur donor for rhodanese, {{needed in order to}} produce thiocyanate.|$|E
25|$|Given {{his very}} weak heart, Poirot conceives {{that he must}} end the string of murders by killing Norton. Poirot invites Norton for hot chocolate: at their meeting, he tells Norton what he {{suspects}} and his plan to execute him. Norton, arrogant and self-assured, insists on swapping cups: anticipating this move, Poirot had drugged both cups, knowing {{that he had a}} higher tolerance for a dose that would incapacitate Norton. Poirot moves the sleeping Norton back to his room using the wheelchair: Poirot could walk, one reason he needed a new valet who was unaware of that for this last case. Then, being the same height as Norton, he disguises himself as Norton by removing his wig and false moustache, ruffling up his grey hair, then donning Norton's dressing-gown and walking with a limp. Having Hastings establish that Norton was alive after he left Poirot's room, Poirot shoots Norton, leaves the pistol on the table and locks the room with a duplicate key. Poirot then writes his story, and ceases to take his <b>amyl</b> <b>nitrite</b> heart medicine. He cannot say it was right to commit murder, but on balance he was sure he prevented yet more instigated by Norton. His last wish for Hastings is typical for Poirot, the matchmaker: he suggests that Hastings should pursue Elizabeth Cole.|$|E
500|$|... 1880: French {{neurologist}} Désiré-Magloire Bourneville had {{a chance}} encounter with the disease that would bear his name. He was working as an unofficial assistant to Jean Martin Charcot at La Salpêtrière. While substituting for his teacher, Louis J.F. Delasiauve, he attended to Marie, a 15-year-old girl with psychomotor retardation, epilepsy and a [...] "confluent vascular-papulous eruption of the nose, the cheeks and forehead". She {{had a history of}} seizures since infancy and was taken to the children's hospital aged three and declared a hopeless case. She had learning difficulties and could neither walk nor talk. While under Bourneville's care, Marie had an ever-increasing number of seizures, which came in clusters. She was treated with quinquina, bromide of camphor, <b>amyl</b> <b>nitrite,</b> and the application of leeches behind the ears. On 7 May 1879 Marie died in her hospital bed. The post-mortem examination disclosed hard, dense tubers in the cerebral convolutions, which Bourneville named Sclérose tubéreuse des circonvolutions cérébrales. He concluded they were the source (focus) of her seizures. In addition, whitish hard masses, one [...] "the size of a walnut", were found in both kidneys.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} {{potassium}} nitrite on the nervous system, brain, spinal cord, pulse, arterial blood pressure, and respiration of healthy human volunteers was noted, {{as was the}} variability between individuals. The most significant observation was that even a small dose of <0.5 grains (≈30 mg) given by mouth caused, at first, an increase in arterial blood pressure, followed by a moderate decrease. With larger doses, pronounced hypotension ensued. They also noted that potassium nitrite, however administered, {{had a profound effect}} on the appearance and oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. They compared the biological action of potassium nitrite with that of <b>amyl</b> and ethyl <b>nitrites</b> and concluded that the similarity of action depends on the conversion of organic nitrites to nitrous acid.|$|R

He thereby became the murderer in Curtain, although it was for the benefit of others.
