5|$|During the Principate {{period of}} the Roman Empire (30 BC – AD 284), the all-mounted alae ("wings") {{contained}} the elite cavalry of the army. They were specially trained in elaborate manoeuvres, such as those displayed to the emperor Hadrian during a documented inspection in Numidia. They were best-suited for large-scale operations and battle, during which they <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> cavalry escort for the legions, which had almost no cavalry of their own. Roman alares were normally armoured, with mail or scale body armour, a cavalry version of the infantry helmet (with more protective features, such as completely covered ears) and oval shield or hexagonal. Their weapons could be a lance, javelins, or bow and arrow but all Roman horseman had a sword called a (spatha) and the ubiquitous pugio. The elite status of an alaris is shown {{by the fact that}} he received 20% greater pay than his counterpart in an auxiliary cohort, and than a legionary infantryman.|$|E

Initially, because millions of items of stock were lost, including most of PIAS's inventory, {{it was thought that}} long-term damage to the British independent music industry might result. On 18 August 2011, PIAS confirmed that their operations were back to normal. On 11 August 2011, London police reported that they had arrested three teenagers in connection with the warehouse fire.|$|E

25|$|Grasslands occur {{where there}} is {{insufficient}} rain to support trees, thus only grasses and a few shrubs can survive. There are three kinds of grasslands on the great plains, short grass prairie, mixed grass, and long grass prairie. In each of these, grass species serve all the keystone roles. They provide food, shelter, act as larval hosts for numerous species and <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> food for buffalo. These grasses are of vital importance to the ecosystem and protect the soil from the strong winds that whip through the prairie. They are all drought resistant and have strong short roots that hold the soil in place.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{found it}} difficult to coordinate the schedules of the principal players and Moffat and Gatiss for a second series. Cumberbatch and Freeman both worked on the 2012 film , and Moffat continued as Doctor Whos showrunner and head writer. In response to the time pressure, The Guardian asserted, the series [...] "features reworkings of three of Conan Doyle's most recognised tales". Gatiss says that there had been an argument for producing these tales over three years, but Moffat explained that they rejected [...] "deferred pleasure". The relationship between Holmes and Watson developed during the second series, with Watson being less amazed by Sherlock's deductive abilities; Watson <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> detective in the second episode, [...] "The Hounds of Baskerville". The cast and production team were more confident during the second series' production following the positive audience and critical reaction to the first series.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} the Hague Abduction Convention was drafted {{domestic}} violence was never explicitly considered as an affirmative defense for child abduction, {{although it may be}} brought as a defense under Article 13, if [...] "there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation." [...] Article 13 supposed that the child's primary caretaker would abduct the child to escape the domestic violence of a non-custodial parent. At the time of the Conventions drafting, joint custody laws were rare. One parent was usually both the custodial parent and primary caretaker while the other, non-custodial parent had rights of access. The move towards joint custody laws conferred both the parent who <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> caretaker and their ex-partner with custodial rights and, by extension, a right to request the return of children wrongfully removed from their place of habitual residence. In addition to not accounting for a shift in child custody law towards shared parenting and joint custody, according to Weiner, the framers of the Convention also did little to account for the motivation for abducting a child, generally assuming that all abductions were harmful to children; however, the child's primary caretaker may be fleeing with a child to protect himself or herself from a dangerous domestic situation.|$|E

2500|$|On August 4, the {{government}} of Belize declared a 30-day state of emergency. The government focused their initial disaster response on search and rescue missions, medical care, helping storm victims, cleaning debris from roads, and restoring utilities. The country's Minister of Works sent employees to clear blocked highways, and {{the government}} hired residents to help clean the streets from debris. Workers quickly restored 75% of the power outages within a day of the hurricane's passage, which increased to 99% by August11. All emergency shelters closed on August12, and the remaining displaced families were provided rent-free lodging {{for up to three}} months. The National Relief and Supplies Management Committee provided food, water, cleaning supplies, tarps, and mattresses to affected residents, helping 8,000people by August10. Damage to water systems resulted in decreased water pressure in buildings, possibly contaminating the nation's water supply. As a result, the Health Ministry advised residents to treat drinking water, and officials worked to repair water systems in the week after the storm's passage. The Belize Water Service sent a truck to the Old Northern Highway. About 90% of residents in damaged houses enacted their own repairs, with the help of neighbors. To assist with disaster relief, the European Union donated [...] to Belize through the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Taiwan sent US$100,000 to the country. The Inter-American Development Bank provided US$200,000 to Belize to purchase food, medicine, and supplies to rebuild. Belize Telemedia Limited also donated US$50,000 toward disaster relief, and Norwegian Cruise Line donated BZ$100,000. The Belize government received US$261,073 from the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility, having first bought an excess rainfall policy in June 2016. UNICEF <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> coordinating agency for the United Nations, its first emergency in that capacity. The agency provided the government with $35,000 toward clean-up, 430family hygiene kits, and emergency SMSs to be distributed by phone.|$|E

5000|$|With {{the removal}} of'"The Rebirth" [...] from Japanese continuity, {{replaced}} with the Transformers: The Headmasters series, Daniel never became a Headmaster {{on the other side}} of the Pacific Ocean - instead, he <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> supporting human character of the series, appearing in almost every episode and regularly playing integral roles alongside Wheelie. Although by all rights supposedly older than he was in his American cartoon appearances, the Japanese interpretation of Daniel regresses his personality to a much more petulant, immature child who often bursts into tears; in that regard, much of the Headmasters series is actually about Daniel growing up and maturing.|$|E
50|$|A long-standing {{debate between}} archaeologists {{concerns}} the main {{function of the}} palace, whether it acted as an administrative center, a religious center, or both, in a theocratic manner. Other important debates consider the role of Knossos {{in the administration of}} Bronze Age Crete, and whether Knossos <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> center, or was on equal footing with the several other contemporaneous palaces that have been discovered on Crete. Many of these palaces were destroyed and abandoned {{in the early part of}} the 15th century BC, possibly by the Mycenaeans, although Knossos remained in use until it was destroyed by fire about one hundred years later. Knossos showed no signs of being a military site; for example, it had neither fortifications nor stores of weapons.|$|E
