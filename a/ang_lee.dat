Plumley in We Were Soldiers. Elliott accepted the role without reading the script, being simply too excited to work with <b>Ang</b> <b>Lee.</b> In addition Elliot also researched Hulk comic books for the part.|$|E

5|$|Thompson's {{screenplay}} {{exaggerated the}} Dashwood family's wealth {{to make their}} later scenes of poverty more apparent to modern audiences. It also altered the traits of the male leads {{to make them more}} appealing to contemporary viewers. Elinor and Marianne's different characteristics were emphasised through imagery and invented scenes. <b>Ang</b> <b>Lee</b> was selected as director, both due to his work in the 1993 film The Wedding Banquet and because Doran believed he would help the film appeal to a wider audience. Lee was given a budget of $16 million.|$|E
5|$|Michael Tolkin and David Hayter rewrote {{the script}} afterwards, despite {{positive}} {{response from the}} producers over France's script. Tolkin was brought in January 2000, while Hayter was brought in September of that year. Hayter's draft featured The Leader, Zzzax, and the Absorbing Man as the villains, who are depicted as colleagues of Banner and {{get caught in the}} same accident that creates the Hulk. Director <b>Ang</b> <b>Lee</b> and his producing partner James Schamus became involved with the film in January 20, 2001. Lee was dissatisfied with Hayter's script, and commissioned Schamus for a rewrite, merging Banner's father with the Absorbing Man. Lee cited influences from King Kong, Frankenstein, Jekyll and Hyde, Beauty and the Beast, Faust, and Greek mythology for his interpretation of the story. Schamus said he had found the storyline that introduced Brian Banner, thus allowing Lee to write a drama that again explored father-son themes.|$|E
5|$|Williams gained public {{recognition}} for Brokeback Mountain, a film directed by <b>Ang</b> <b>Lee</b> that depicts the homosexual relationship between Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal).

After viewing The Station Agent, casting director Avy Kaufman suggested to Lee that he cast Williams as Alma. The film was a box office hit, grossing around $178million worldwide in ticket sales against its $14million production costs. The film received eight Oscar nominations, the most for any film that year, including a Best Supporting Actress nomination for Williams, and it won three accolades at the 78th Academy Awards. The saffron Vera Wang dress, which she wore to the Academy Awards in March 2006, has been cited by Cosmopolitan magazine as one of the Best Oscar dresses of all time.|$|E
