5|$|Copper, zinc, tin, <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> are {{mechanically}} weaker metals {{but have}} useful corrosion prevention properties. While {{each of them}} will react with air, the resulting patinas of either various copper salts, zinc carbonate, tin oxide, or a mixture of lead oxide, carbonate, and sulfate, confer valuable protective properties. Copper <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> are therefore used, for example, as roofing materials; zinc acts as an anti-corrosion agent in galvanised steel; and tin serves a similar purpose on steel cans.|$|E

5|$|At the Jock River, {{southwest}} of Barrhaven, deposits of sensitive leda clay presented {{a challenge in}} designing the crossing for the freeway {{as well as the}} Canadian National Railway overpass to the north. It was feared that the weight of these structures could destabilize the clay deposits beneath <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> to landslides. In place of the standard heavier aggregate, lighter blast furnace slag, at half the weight, was substituted.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{to generalize}} {{ordinary}} quantum field theories, used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, {{so as to}} include gravity have led to serious problems. Some have argued that at low energies, this approach proves successful, in that it results in an acceptable effective (quantum) field theory of gravity. At very high energies, however, the perturbative results are badly divergent <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> to models devoid of predictive power ("perturbative non-renormalizability").|$|E

5|$|Chromium, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> {{have the}} {{greatest}} potential to cause harm on account of their extensive use, the toxicity {{of some of their}} combined or elemental forms, and their widespread distribution in the environment. Hexavalent chromium, for example, is highly toxic as are mercury vapour and many mercury compounds. These five elements have a strong affinity for sulfur; in the human body they usually bind, via thiol groups (–SH), to enzymes responsible for controlling the speed of metabolic reactions. The resulting sulfur-metal bonds inhibit the proper functioning of the enzymes involved; human health deteriorates, sometimes fatally. Chromium (in its hexavalent form) and arsenic are carcinogens; cadmium causes a degenerative bone disease; and mercury <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> damage the central nervous system.|$|E
