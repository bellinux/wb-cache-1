40|$|The dual-pump {{coherent}} anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) {{method was}} used to measure temperature and the mole fractions of N 2 and O 2 in a supersonic combustor. Experiments were conducted in NASA Langley Research Center s Direct Connect Supersonic Combustion Test Facility. In this facility, H 2 and oxygen-enriched <b>air</b> <b>burn</b> to increase the enthalpy of the simulated air test gas. This gas is expanded through a Mach 2 nozzle and into a combustor model consisting of a short constant-area section followed by a small rearward-facing step and another constant-area section. At the end of this straight section, H 2 fuel is injected at Mach 2 and at a 30 angle with respect to the freestream. One wall of the duct then expands at a 3 angle for over 1 meter. The ensuing combustion is probed optically through ports {{in the side of the}} combustor. Dual-pump CARS measurements were performed at the facility nozzle exit and at four planes downstream of fuel injection. Maps are presented of the mean temperature, as well as N 2 and O 2 mean mole fraction fields. Correlations between fluctuations of the different measured parameters are also presented...|$|E
40|$|The dual-pump {{coherent}} anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) {{method was}} used to measure temperature and the absolute mole fractions of N 2, O 2 and H 2 in a supersonic non-reacting fuel-air mixing experiment. Experiments were conducted in NASA Langley Research Center s Direct Connect Supersonic Combustion Test Facility. Under normal operation of this facility, hydrogen and <b>air</b> <b>burn</b> to increase the enthalpy of the test gas and O 2 is added to simulate air. This gas is expanded through a Mach 2 nozzle and into a combustor model where fuel is then injected, mixes and burns. In the present experiment the O 2 of the test gas is replaced by N 2. The lack of oxidizer inhibited combustion of the injected H 2 fuel jet allowing the fuel/air mixing process to be studied. CARS measurements were performed 427 mm downstream of the nozzle exit and 260 mm downstream of the fuel injector. Maps were obtained of the mean temperature, as well as the N 2, O 2 and H 2 mean mole fraction fields. A map of mean H 2 O vapor mole fraction was also inferred from these measurements. Correlations between different measured parameters and their fluctuations are presented. The CARS measurements are compared with a preliminary computational prediction of the flow...|$|E

40|$|Large-scale {{utilization}} of wood which command absolute majority in biomass for functional carbon precursors contributes to reduce greenhouse effect. Wood char generally has {{a limit on}} material usage because of its non-graphitic structure^ 1 ^, so we developed a new functional wood char by iron-, or nickel-catalyzed carbonization, which has a graphite-like structure with mesopores good for electroconductivity and liquid phase adsorption capacity for macro molecules^ 2 - 5 ^. However the fine structure of the wood char is still not clear. Here we report more than 70 wt % of iron-catalyzed wood char is filled with chained carbon shells formed by 3 ~ 20 defective stacking layers of carbon hexagonal planes, which look like nanometer-sized worms swarm. We name them &#x 22;carbon shell chains&#x 22;. The discussion of the formation mechanism reveals that the wood cell wall {{plays an important role}} for their efficient production. They are stable at 1800 ºC under vacuum, but in <b>air,</b> <b>burn</b> under 600 ºC, and are perfectly conversed into hydrogen and carbon monoxide in a short time by steam at 900 ºC. The control of their decomposition will bring out a new talent in the wood char as a big source of supply for nano-graphite or nano-graphene, for which nanometer size and edge effects have recently attracted considerable attention^ 6 ^. In addition, a simple and easy preparation of carbon shell chains implies that they may be naturally produced on or in the earth rich in iron, and might be misinterpreted as nano-worms, though most of them may decompose into organic gases...|$|E
40|$|Some {{reservoirs}} contain {{oil that}} is too difficult to produce with conventional means. One of the methods to recover oil from medium and low viscosity in complex reservoirs uses air injection leading to oil combustion. In this case the oxygen in the <b>air</b> <b>burns</b> the heavier components of the oil, generating a heat wave leading to vaporization of lighter components...|$|R

The Kremlin provided him with three children, but not before Krulik had tested the serum on himself. However, when he first used his speed, the friction from the <b>air</b> <b>burned</b> him alive.|$|R

50|$|Al Hinshaw {{signed on}} WIFM in 1949. Most FM {{stations}} were paired with an AM, but Hinshaw's brother owned a radio repair shop {{and they both}} believed FM was the future. WIFM was also different from other radio stations because it played pre-recorded music, while other stations <b>aired</b> <b>Burns</b> and Allen, Jack Benny and Amos 'n' Andy. Still, few people had FM radios, so the station had almost no listeners. An AM station added in 1953 did not perform much better.|$|R
