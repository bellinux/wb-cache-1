5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and <b>acitretin</b> (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E

[...] Autologous donors are not always {{screened for}} recipient safety problems since the donor is the only person who will receive the blood. Since the donated blood may be given to pregnant women or a women of child-bearing age, donors taking teratogenic (birth defect causing) medications are deferred.

50|$|It is a {{metabolite}} of etretinate, {{which was}} used prior {{to the introduction of}} <b>acitretin.</b> Etretinate was discontinued because it had a narrow therapeutic index as well as a long elimination half-life (t1/2=120 days), making dosing difficult. In contrast, acitretin's half-life is approximately 2 days. However, because <b>acitretin</b> can be reverse metabolised into etretinate which has an extremely long half-life, women must avoid becoming pregnant {{for at least three years}} after discontinuing <b>acitretin.</b> Therefore, <b>acitretin</b> is generally not recommended for women of child-bearing age with a risk of becoming pregnant.|$|E

50|$|<b>Acitretin</b> {{is noted}} for the {{possibility}} of severe birth defects and should not be used by pregnant women or women planning to get pregnant within 3 years following the use of <b>acitretin.</b> Sexually active women of childbearing age who use <b>acitretin</b> should also use at least two forms of birth control concurrently. Men and women who use it should not donate blood for three years after using it, because of the possibility that the blood might be used in a pregnant patient and cause birth defects. In addition, it may cause nausea, headache, itching, dry, red or flaky skin, dry or red eyes, dry or chapped lips, swollen lips, dry mouth, thirst, cystitis acne or hair loss.|$|E

50|$|<b>Acitretin</b> is an oral retinoid {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of severe resistant psoriasis. Because of the potential for problems and severe side effects it is generally used in only very severe cases of psoriasis that have been unresponsive to other treatments. It binds to nuclear receptors that regulates gene transcription. They induce keratinocyte differentiation and reduce epidermal hyperplasia, leading to the slowing of cell reproduction. <b>Acitretin</b> is readily absorbed and widely distributed after oral administration.

5000|$|Psoralen and {{ultraviolet}} A phototherapy (PUVA) {{combines the}} oral or topical administration of psoralen with exposure to ultraviolet A (UVA) light. The {{mechanism of action}} of PUVA is unknown, but probably involves activation of psoralen by UVA light, which inhibits the abnormally rapid production of the cells in psoriatic skin. There are multiple mechanisms of action associated with PUVA, including effects on the skin's immune system. PUVA is associated with nausea, headache, fatigue, burning, and itching. Long-term treatment is associated with squamous cell carcinoma (but not with melanoma).

40|$|Background: Psoriasis vulgaris is {{a chronic}} disease that {{significantly}} affects patient&# 039;s {{quality of life}} and poses an economic burden. <b>Acitretin</b> is a second-generation retinoid used for psoriasis in clinical practice. Orally administered Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), alone or combined with <b>acitretin,</b> has been used for the clinical management of psoriasis vulgaris. This systematic review evaluates the efficacy of oral CHM in comparison with <b>acitretin</b> and the add-on effect of oral CHM to <b>acitretin.</b> Methods: Five English databases and four Chinese databases were searched from their inceptions to May 2014. Included randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) were published in English or Chinese, compared oral CHM or the combination of oral CHM and <b>acitretin</b> with <b>acitretin,</b> and used Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) as the outcome measure. Results: A total of 25 RCTs were included in this review: 8 studies compared oral CHM with <b>acitretin,</b> 12 compared the combination with <b>acitretin</b> alone, and 5 were three-arm studies that compared both with <b>acitretin.</b> Conclusion: The meta-analysis indicated that oral CHM was effective for psoriasis vulgaris as follows: (1) Oral CHM is neither superior nor inferior to <b>acitretin,</b> and (2) oral CHM could produce add-on effects when combined with <b>acitretin.</b> Oral CHM itself appeared safe for treating psoriasis vulgaris and possibly could reduce the common adverse events seen with <b>acitretin.</b> However, the long-term effect and safety of oral CHM could not be assessed. Further research should consider including a placebo control and using outcome measures according to international guidelines to evaluate CHM, as well as include follow-ups to monitor longer-term efficacy and safety...|$|E
40|$|<b>Acitretin</b> is a time-honored {{treatment}} for psoriasis. During {{the last decade}} biologics have revolutionized the treatment of psoriasis. This raises the question: What is the position of <b>acitretin</b> as a classical systemic {{treatment for}} psoriasis {{in the era of}} biologics? Based on the mode of action of <b>acitretin,</b> it is evident that at least one antipsoriatic treatment has to be available in the armamentarium of antipsoriatic treatments that is not immunosuppressive, intended for those patients who are contraindicated for immunosuppressive treatment. It is attractive to speculate that at least an additive or possibly a synergistic effect can be expected in case of combination of <b>acitretin</b> with a biologic. The efficacy of <b>acitretin</b> in chronic plaque psoriasis as a monotherapy is below methotrexate and cyclosporine. However, <b>acitretin</b> in combination with phototherapy has an efficacy at least comparable with the other classical systemic treatments. Based on several clinical studies it can be concluded that <b>acitretin</b> is an important treatment option in case of contraindications for immunosuppression, such as patients with infections or cancer-prone patients. Furthermore, some evidence is available for high efficacy of the combination of <b>acitretin</b> and biologics...|$|E

Patients using alitretinoin or <b>acitretin</b> between 01 - 01 - 1994 and 01 - 08 - 2015 were included in this retrospective daily practice study and analyzed by Kaplan-Meier drug survival curves. Potential determinants were analyzed by Cox regression analyses. Ninety-five patients were treated with alitretinoin and 109 patients with <b>acitretin.</b> The main reasons for discontinuation were adverse events and cleared hand eczema, 29. 5 and 27. 4 % in alitretinoin versus 43. 1 and 23. 9 % in <b>acitretin.</b> Patients with hyperkeratotic hand eczema had most often a good effect of treatment: 68. 3 % in alitretinoin and 50. 7 % in <b>acitretin</b> treatment.

40|$|<b>Acitretin,</b> {{an active}} {{metabolite}} of etretinate, is {{as effective as}} etretinate {{in the treatment of}} psoriasis. Recently, we developed some water-soluble formulations of <b>acitretin</b> with 2 -hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) /randomly substituted methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (RMBCD). In this study, the biopharmaceutic properties of these formulations were tested in Sprague-Dawley rats. After single intravenous dosing (2. 5, 5, or 10 mg/kg) with the HPBCD-based formulation, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of <b>acitretin</b> increased proportionally with the dose and its clearance remained unchanged within the tested dose range. We also found that the RMBCD-based formulation of <b>acitretin</b> improved its bioavailability and decreased the variations in various pharmacokinetic parameters. The improved biopharmaceutic properties of RMBCD-based <b>acitretin</b> might be attributed to its enhanced aqueous solubility. The elimination of <b>acitretin</b> through bile excretion was also studied. Our results indicated that the major fraction of <b>acitretin</b> (similar to 40 %) was excreted in the bile as beta-glucuronide conjugate and only trace amounts were excreted as unconjugated <b>acitretin</b> (similar to 0. 5 %).
