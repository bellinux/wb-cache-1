500|$|.....<b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> out I {{climbed on}} to the railing and threw myself out to the wire-netting, a {{distance}} of between 20 and 30 feet. The idea in my mind was [...] "one big tragedy may save many others". I realised that my best means of carrying out my purpose was the iron staircase. When a good moment came, quite deliberately I walked upstairs and threw myself from the top, as I meant, {{on to the}} iron staircase. If I had been successful I should undoubtedly have been killed, {{as it was a}} clear drop of 30 to 40 feet. But I caught {{on the edge of the}} netting. I then threw myself forward on my head with all my might.|$|E
2500|$|ERICKSON: Well, if the kid {{came in to}} see me, {{the first}} thing I would {{do would be to}} want to examine the cross. And I would want to improve it in a very minor way. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the {{slightest}} minor change in it, the way would be open for a larger change. And [...] pretty soon I could deal with the advantages of a different cross - he ought to have at least two. He ought to have at least three so he could make a choice each day of which one. It's pretty hard to express a psychotic pattern of behavior over an ever-increasing number of crosses.|$|E
2500|$|Ward, {{who first}} saw it, said, [...] "It {{looked more like}} an old broken-down suitcase. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to it and got a good look, I knew exactly what it was." [...] McNief called the police from Ochsenbein's Grocery Store. Runnels investigated, with Deputy Sheriff Z. C. Henslee and {{officers}} Pete Carrara and Bill Bagwell. The music case {{was placed in a}} paste board box and returned to Chief Runnels's office. The saxophone was tarnished and the leather case's bottom and lining had deteriorated enough that pieces fell to the ground as it was placed in the box. A Texas High School emblem was also in the case, as well as sheet music for [...] "The Song of the Navy", probably played at the dance on the night of Booker's death.|$|E

2500|$|Bianca and Babe's {{friendship}} {{became popular}} with viewers while both characters were pregnant. The relationship {{was described as}} a [...] "beautiful friendship" [...] by Soap Opera Digest. Within the series, when the two give birth to their children on the same night (Bianca to Miranda and Babe to Little Adam), their bond further endeared them to the audience. Of the birth scenes, actress Eden Riegel, Bianca's portrayer, stated, [...] "I had done so much research. I read books [...] What to Expect When You're Expecting. I watched the TLC series A Baby Story. It felt like I watched hundreds of episodes! <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> home I'd be watching women give birth on TV." [...] Riegel added that one of her makeup artists was pregnant and invited her to go along to a Lamaze class. She sat in a room [...] "full of pregnant Upper West Siders" [...] and practiced breathing exercises.|$|E

6000|$|... “I {{should have}} liked to have written and thanked you for them <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> them,” said Ella, and Bertie’s sky clouded at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "General," [...] said I, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{into his}} paijamahs (or tent), [...] "you must leave your lunch {{if you want}} to fight the enemy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{here because}} you are," [...] he replied, and the {{simplicity}} of his reply moved her deeply. [...] "I came <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> your letter," [...] he went on.|$|E

6000|$|... "I was {{determined}} to come and look you up <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> time, but the House sat very late. However, I have got a fortnight here now, and shall see plenty of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “These, my lord, {{are a few}} traits {{with which}} you discern the genius [...] of Mr. Lintot, which I have chosen for {{the subject of a}} letter.

60|$|ENID. When I went I was all {{on their}} side, but <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> there I {{began to feel}} quite {{different}} at once. People talk about sympathy with the working classes, they don't {{know what it means}} to try and put it into practice. It seems hopeless.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't like it, captain, so I gave Squire Butterfield to understand, privately; for {{as he had}} a {{majority}} with him, I didn't approve of speaking too strongly on the subject. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{him out of the}} tavern, however, the current set the other way." ...|$|E

I {{was sent}} off to Brunswick's camp, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> up, and have heard nothing about it; and the marshal forbade me to speak to you, when you were brought in last night. He merely said that you had done a very gallant action." ...|$|E
