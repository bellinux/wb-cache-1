40|$|AbstractConsidering {{the impacts}} of human {{activities}} on the environment, {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} are one of the major concerns. The CCS technologies are seen as an option that can help to decrease the emissions of CO 2 and reduce potential effects that a heightened CO 2 concentration might have. The technical solution of capture, transport and storage of the CO 2 originating in large emission point sources (power plants, industry) is depending on local conditions and can vary significantly. The <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubbing</b> was chosen for CO 2 separation from flue gas of lignite coal power plant (typical conditions for the Czech Republic) in the national project MPO FR-TI 1 / 379. Environmental gains and impacts of the power plant and the optimized variant of the capture technology based on <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubbing</b> were assessed on the basis of material and energy flow balance. The potential environmental impacts of the power plant with and without CO 2 capture were compared using LCA methodology...|$|E

40|$|This report {{relates to}} the Defense Waste Processing Facility.) The {{concentrations}} of mercury at the FAFC inlet and exit were measured during the BL 1 and PX 6 runs of the Integrated DWPF Melter System (IDMS) with the HEME bypassed and without the ammonia scrubber. The results show that mercury concentrations of approximately 2. 6 - 12. 7 (mean = 6. 2) times saturation occur at the FAFC exit. The concentration of mercury at the SRAT condenser exit {{was found to be}} 10 times the saturation value. FAVC exit mercury concentrations of 6. 2 times saturation would result in DWPF emitting up to 438 lb/yr of mercury at 100 percent attainments, which is in excess of the permit limit of 175 lb/yr. However, operation of the FAVC with the HEME should reduce the mercury emissions. The addition of the ammonia scrubbers should also reduce the mercury emissions since the nitric acid used to <b>scrub</b> <b>ammonia</b> should also <b>scrub</b> mercury...|$|R
40|$|This work studies carbon fate using 14 C tracer {{technique}} in ecosystems when synthesized fertilizer is applied. The concept of aqueous <b>ammonia</b> solution <b>scrubbing</b> CO 2 from flue gas {{is used in}} the fertilizer synthesis. Products after the capture are ammonium bicarbonate (ABC, NH 4 HCO 3) or long-term effect ammonium bicarbonate (LEABC, NH 4 HCO 3), an economic source of nitrogen fertilizer. The fertilizer (ABC or LEABC) is used as a “carrier ” to transport CO 2 from the atmosphere to the crops and soil. An indoor greenhouse was built and wheat was chosen as the plant to study in this ecosystem. The investigated ecosystem consists of plant (wheat), soils with three different pH values (alkaline, neutral and acidic), and three types of undergroundwater (different Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + concentrations). After biological assimilation and metabolism in wheat receiving ABC or LEABC, it was found that a considerable amount (up to 10 %) of the carbon source is absorbed by the wheat with increased biomass production. The majority of the unused carbon source (up to 76 %) percolated into the soil as carbonates, such as environmentally benign calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Generally speaking, alkaline soil has a higher capability to capture and store carbon. For the same soil, there is no apparent difference in carbon capturing capability between ABC fertilizer and LEABC fertilizer. These findings answer the question how carbon is distributed after synthesized fertilizer is applied into the ecosystem. In addition, a separate post-experiment on fertilizer carbon forms that exist in the soil was made. It was found that up to 88 % of the trapped carbon exists in the form of insoluble salts (i. e., CaCO 3) in alkaline soils. This indicates that alkaline soil has...|$|R
40|$|New {{technologies}} {{are needed for}} manure treatment that can capture nutrients, reduce emissions of ammonia and nuisance odours, and kill harmful pathogens. A reactor concept was developed for simultaneous treatment of separately collected liquid and solid fractions of pig manure. The liquid fraction is concentrated by evaporating the water using energy from the composting system {{and at the same}} time <b>scrubbing</b> <b>ammonia</b> from the composting off-gas by acidifying the urine to pH 4 with nitric acid. This results in two marketable products, a concentrated liquid nitrogen fertiliser (NH 4 NO 3) without phosphorus, and a stabilised, solid organic fertiliser, which is free of pathogens and weeds. By connecting the two reactor systems, emissions of ammonia and odours are abated as ammonia emitted from the composting is trapped in the liquid fraction and odorous compounds emitted from the liquid are degraded in the composting reactor. The concept was physically simulated by coupling a 80 -L compost reactor to a 10 -L bubble column. Operation of the bench-scale system showed that the concept is very promising. All nutrients were captured, and emissions of ammonia and odours were almost completely abated...|$|R
40|$|In the Dutch Hercules project feces {{and urine}} from pigs are {{collected}} separately and treated in two processes: feces are composted and urine is concentrated by water evaporation. Water unsaturated exhaust {{air from the}} pig house is used for evaporation in a packed bed scrubber. The urine is acidified with nitric acid to scrub ammonia from the air. In this way a concentrated N/K fertilizer is produced from urine and ammonia {{is removed from the}} pig house exhaust air. Experiments were conducted using a pilot scale packed bed scrubber in an experimental pig house. The <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubbing</b> efficiency and the evaporation rate were determined during one pig fattening round of 112 days. The average composition of the collected pig urine was 4. 4 g nitrogen/kg, 6. 6 g potassium/kg and 0. 03 g phosphorus/kg. The volume of the urine was reduced by a factor 6 - 7 resulting in a concentrate composition of 91. 3 g/kg total nitrogen (including nitrogen added as nitric acid), 46. 5 g/kg potassium and 0. 2 g/kg phosphorus. The mean evaporation rate was 28 kg/day at inlet air conditions of 74 % relative humidity and a temperature of 19 °C. The inlet air of the scrubber was more humid (74 % instead of 60 %) than expected. This resulted in a evaporation rate that was below expectations. The <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubbing</b> efficiency was determined 5 times and ranged from 68 to 95 %. The efficiency decreased at higher salt concentrations of the urin...|$|E

40|$|Coal is {{indispensable}} {{to satisfy the}} world’s thirst for energy as innovative coal technologies are for climate protection. This paper focuses on the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) technology, based on its potentially higher cycle efficiency than competitive pulverized-coal steam cycles. However, cycle efficiency alone {{is not enough for}} CO 2 emission mitigation, as a more significant decrease in CO 2 emissions can be reached with the implementation of carbon capture and storage (CCS). In particular, an advanced air-blown IGCC system is considered when gasifying a coal with high-sulphur content, which is really relevant for the coal market. The sulphur removed as H 2 S from the coal-derived gas before fuelling the combustion turbine is used in a wet sulphuric acid process to supply an agent useful to control ammonia slip in a post-combustion CO 2 capture system based on <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubbing</b> and designed for a reduced energy demand. Thus, reducing the energy impact of the CCS technology will reflect on higher power plant efficiency, related to a presumable lower cost of the generated electricity, as a high-sulphur coal is used as fuel input.

40|$|Anthropogenic CO 2 {{released}} from fossil fuel combustion {{is a primary}} greenhouse gas which contributes to “global warming. ” It is estimated that stationary power generation contributes over one-third of total CO 2 emissions. Reducing CO 2 in the atmosphere can be accomplished either by decreasing {{the rate at which}} CO 2 is emitted into the atmosphere or by increasing the rate at which it is removed from it. Extensive research has been conducted on determining a fast and inexpensive method to sequester carbon dioxide. These methods can be classified into two categories, CO 2 fixation by natural sink process for CO 2, or direct CO 2 sequestration by artificial processes. In direct sequestration, CO 2 produced from sources such as coal-fired power plants, would be captured from the exhausted gases. CO 2 from a combustion exhaust gas is absorbed with an aqueous <b>ammonia</b> solution through <b>scrubbing.</b> The captured CO 2 is then used to synthesize ammonium bicarbonate (ABC or NH 4 HCO 3), an economical source of nitrogen fertilizer. In this work, we studied the carbon distribution after fertilizer is synthesized from CO 2. The synthesized fertilizer in laboratory is used as a “CO 2 carrier” to “transport” CO 2 from the atmosphere to crops. After biological assimilation and metabolism in crops treated with ABC, a considerable amount of the carbon source is absorbed by the plants with increased biomass production. The majority of the unused carbon source percolates into the soil as carbonates, such as calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and magnesium carbonate (MgCO 3). These carbonates are environmentally benign. As insoluble salts, they are found in normal rocks and can be stored safely and permanently in soil. This investigation mainly focuses on the carbon distribution after the synthesized fertilizer is applied to soil. Quantitative examination of carbon distribution in an ecosystem is a challenging task since the carbon in the soil may come from various sources. Therefore synthesized 14 C tagged NH 4 HCO 3 (ABC) was used. Products of ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) or long-term effect ammonium bicarbonate (LEABC) were tagged with 14 C when they were synthesized in the laboratory. An indoor greenhouse was built and wheat was chosen as the plant to study in this ecosystem. The investigated ecosystem consists of plant (wheat), soils with three different pH values (alkaline, neutral and acid), and three types of underground water (different Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + concentrations). After biological assimilation and metabolism in wheat receiving ABC or LEABC, it was found that a considerable amount (up to 10 %) of the carbon source is absorbed by the wheat with increased biomass production.

40|$|AbstractAbsorption {{characteristics}} of CO 2 into aqueous ammonia {{are the key}} factors to achieve simultaneous removal of pollutants from coal-fired flue gas by <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubbing.</b> An experimental study with asemi-continuous flow reactor was conducted to investigate the CO 2 absorption characteristic of aqueous ammonia solutions. Pure CO 2 was chosen {{in order to avoid}} the effect by the other gas components in this paper. The effect on solution CO 2 loading and CO 2 absorption capacity, which is caused by ammonia concentration, CO 2 inlet velocity and temperature, has been given. Furthermore, the effect on absorption characteristic and slippery {{characteristics of}} ammonia caused by additives is also covered. The experiment results show that, with increase of ammonia concentration, the solution CO 2 loading increases while the CO 2 absorption capacity decreases. Both the above two parameters decrease with the increase of CO 2 inlet velocity, but the total reaction rate acts reversely. When the temperature reaches 15  °C or 35  °C, the absorption characteristic can reach the extreme points. Adding AMP into ammonia can enhance the absorption of CO 2, and control the slippery of ammonia in the absorption process. What’ s more, 3 % is a better choice for addition concentration...|$|E

Focusing on three levels of CO 2 capture, from 80 % to 90 %, it is possible to appreciate that the cooled mode is promising as far as a reduction of the energy cost related to CO 2 capture is concerned. As a matter of fact, the energy saving, possible when adopting an air cooling system instead of a chilling plant, is significant with the specific primary energy consumption for 90 % of CO 2 avoided which decreases from 2. 79 MJ/kgCO 2 to 2. 54 MJ/kgCO 2, when switching from the chilled to the cooled mode, with a difference equal to about 0. 7 percentage point in IGCC efficiency...|$|E

Hellickson An in-house air modification system capable of allowing reduced recommended winter ventilation rates in warm confinement broiler houses was designed, fabricated, and tested. System design {{was based on}} control of moisture, heat, and ammonia to levels that promote maximum broiler performance. Design conditions necessary to size the major components of the air modification system re determined using {{the results of a}} broiler house ventilation model. The model was used to establish the necessary heat, moisture, and ammonia balances within a structure at ventilation rates reduced to as much as 50 percent of those normally required to meet the moisture balance. The air modification system was fabricated to combine three major components into a tower arrangement. These were: 1) an air/water constant contact packed bed dehumidifier; 2) clinoptilolite <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubbing</b> beds; and 3) a heat pump energy recovery and redistribution system. Tests on system performance showed an ability to condense 0. 28 kg/mm of ter vapor from flow-through chamber air and redistribute the latent heat energy, plus Redacted for privacy work of compression, to the inside chamber air. High system energy consumption, coupled with difficulty in establishing a thermal comfort zone at bird level using convective heat transfer properties of the modified air stream prevent economic application at this time. Recommendations were made to improve the system and reduce energy demand...|$|E
40|$|We {{compare the}} exergetic {{performance}} of a conventional industrial mushroom production chain with a mushroom production chain where part of the compost waste is recycled and reused as raw material. The critical exergy loss points (CEPs) identified are the cooking-out process of the spent mushroom substrate, and the phase I composting process which are related to chemical and physical exergy losses, respectively. The total exergy input requirements for the conventional chain are higher (24 GJ per three flushes of mushrooms) than for the alternative chain (17 GJ per three flushes of mushrooms) since more raw materials are required. The largest exergy losses are due to unclosed material balances, i. e. chemical exergy losses, which represent 69 % of the total exergy losses for the conventional chain, and 56 % for the alternative production chain. Therefore, it only makes sense to reduce any avoidable physical exergy losses after utilizing all mass streams maximally that translate into chemical exergy flows. Further comparison of exergetic indicators (e. g. specific exergy losses, and exergetic cost) shows that recycling material streams would improve the resource efficiency of the industrial mushroom production chain considerably. The variations in the assumed electricity consumption values for the ventilation in phase I composting and for the <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubbing</b> process affect greatly the exergetic indicators {{and the number of}} critical exergy loss points indicating that any further improvement on the exergetic performance of the mushroom production chain should focus on these two process variables.

The polymers with a MAAM-to-EGDMA molar ratio from 0. 3 to 0. 9 were inherently nitrogen-enriched and exhibited a high affinity towards selective CO 2 capture at low pressures. A techno-economic model based on a 580 MWel supercritical coal-fired power plant scenario was developed to evaluate {{the performance of the}} synthesised adsorbents. The presence and density of NH 2 moieties within the polymer network were determined using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the polymers were thermally stable up to 242 - 259 °C. The maximum CO 2 adsorption capacity at 273 K was 1. 56 mmol/g and the isosteric heat of adsorption was 28 − 35 kJ/mol. An increase in the density of amide groups within the polymer network resulted in a higher affinity towards CO 2 at low pressure. At a CO 2 :N 2 ratio of 15 : 85, CO 2 /N 2 selectivity at 273 K was 52 at 1 bar and reached 104 at ultra-low CO 2 partial pressure. The techno-economic analysis revealed that retrofitting a HCP-MAAM-based CO 2 capture system led to a net energy penalty of 7. 7 – 8. 0 %HHV points, which was noticeably lower than that reported for MEA or chilled <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubbing</b> capture systems. The specific heat requirement was superior to the majority of conventional solvents such as MDEA-PZ and K 2 CO 3.
