5|$|In 1887, Tesla {{developed}} an induction motor that ran on alternating current, a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States {{because of its}} advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission.

This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.|$|E

5|$|In 350 BCE, Greek philosopher Aristotle {{suggested}} that nature abhors a vacuum, <b>a</b> <b>principle</b> that {{became known as}} the horror vacui. This concept built upon a 5th-century BCE ontological argument by the Greek philosopher Parmenides, who denied the possible existence of a void in space. Based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist, in the West it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be empty. As late as the 17th century, the French philosopher René Descartes argued that the entirety of space must be filled.|$|E

5|$|German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel {{presented}} {{two main}} criticisms of Kantian ethics. He first argued that Kantian ethics provides no specific {{information about what}} people should do because Kant's moral law is solely <b>a</b> <b>principle</b> of non-contradiction. He argued that Kant's ethics lack any content and so cannot constitute a supreme principle of morality. To illustrate this point, Hegel and his followers have presented {{a number of cases}} in which the Formula of Universal Law either provides no meaningful answer or gives an obviously wrong answer. Hegel used Kant's example of being trusted with another man's money to argue that Kant's Formula of Universal Law cannot determine whether a social system of property is a morally good thing, because either answer can entail contradictions. He also used the example of helping the poor: if everyone helped the poor, there would be no poor left to help, so beneficence would be impossible if universalised, making it immoral according to Kant's model. Hegel's second criticism was that Kant's ethics forces humans into an internal conflict between reason and desire. For Hegel, it is unnatural for humans to suppress their desire and subordinate it to reason. This means that, by not addressing the tension between self-interest and morality, Kant's ethics cannot give humans any reason to be moral.|$|E
5|$|In 1517, the Wittenberg monk Martin Luther publicised The Ninety-Five Theses, {{challenging}} the Roman Catholic Church and initiating the Protestant Reformation. In 1555, the Peace of Augsburg established Lutheranism as an acceptable alternative to Catholicism, but also decreed that {{the faith of}} the prince was to be the faith of his subjects, <b>a</b> <b>principle</b> called Cuius regio, eius religio. The agreement at Augsburg failed to address other religious creed: for example, the Reformed faith was still considered a heresy and the principle did not address the possible conversion of an ecclesiastic ruler, such as happened in Electorate of Cologne in 1583. From the Cologne War {{until the end of the}} Thirty Years' Wars (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands. The latter reduced the overall population of the German states by about 30 per cent, and in some places, up to 80 per cent. The Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the German states. German rulers were able to choose either Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism or the Reformed faith as their official religion after 1648.|$|E

40|$|A grand {{challenge}} in network science is apparently the missing of a structural theory of networks. The authors have {{showed that the}} existence of community structures is a universal phenomenon in real networks, and that neither randomness nor preferential attachment is a mechanism of community structures of network [A. Li, J. Li, and Y. Pan, Community structures are definable in networks, and universal in the real world, To appear. ]. This poses a fundamental question: What are the mechanisms of community structures of real networks? Here we found that homophyly is the mechanism of community structures and a structural theory of networks. We proposed a homophyly model. It was shown that networks of our model satisfy a series of new topological, probabilistic and combinatorial <b>principles,</b> including <b>a</b> fundamental <b>principle,</b> <b>a</b> community structure <b>principle,</b> <b>a</b> degree priority <b>principle,</b> <b>a</b> widths <b>principle,</b> <b>an</b> inclusion and infection <b>principle,</b> <b>a</b> king node <b>principle,</b> and <b>a</b> predicting <b>principle</b> etc, leading to a structural theory of networks. Our model demonstrates that homophyly is the underlying mechanism of community structures of networks, that nodes of the same community share common features, that power law and small world property are never obstacles of the existence of community structures in networks, and that community structures are definable in networks.

5|$|Some animals, {{such as the}} horned lizards of North America, {{have evolved}} {{elaborate}} measures to eliminate shadow. Their bodies are flattened, with the sides thinning to an edge; the animals habitually press their bodies to the ground; and their sides are fringed with white scales which effectively hide and disrupt any remaining areas of shadow there may be under {{the edge of the}} body. The theory that the body shape of the horned lizards which live in open desert is adapted to minimise shadow is supported by the one species which lacks fringe scales, the roundtail horned lizard, which lives in rocky areas and resembles a rock. When this species is threatened, it makes itself look as much like a rock as possible by curving its back, emphasizing its three-dimensional shape. Some species of butterflies, such as the speckled wood, Pararge aegeria, minimise their shadows when perched by closing the wings over their backs, aligning their bodies with the sun, and tilting to one side towards the sun, so that the shadow becomes a thin inconspicuous line rather than a broad patch. Similarly, some ground-nesting birds including the European nightjar select a resting position facing the sun. The elimination of shadow was identified as <b>a</b> <b>principle</b> of military camouflage during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The CPC is, officially, {{organized}} on {{the basis}} of democratic centralism, <b>a</b> <b>principle</b> conceived by Russian Marxist theoretician Vladimir Lenin which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies. The highest body of the CPC is the National Congress, convened every fifth year. When the National Congress is not in session, the Central Committee is the highest body, but since the body meets normally only once a year, most duties and responsibilities are vested in the Politburo and its Standing Committee. The party's leader holds the offices of General Secretary (responsible for civilian party duties), Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) (responsible for military affairs) and State President (a largely ceremonial position). Through these posts the party leader is the country's paramount leader. The current paramount leader is Xi Jinping who was elected at the 19th National Congress held in October 2017.|$|E

5|$|The Sermons of Swift {{have none}} of that thunder which appals, or that resistless and winning {{softness}} which melts, the hearts of an audience. He can never have enjoyed the triumph of uniting hundreds in one ardent sentiment of love, of terror, or of devotion. His reasoning, however powerful, and indeed unanswerable, convinces the understanding, but is never addressed to the heart; and, indeed, from his instructions to a young clergyman, he seems hardly to have considered pathos as a legitimate ingredient in an English sermon. Occasionally, too, Swift's misanthropic habits break out even from the pulpit; nor is he altogether able to suppress his disdain of those fellow mortals, on whose behalf was accomplished the great work of redemption. With such unamiable feelings towards his hearers, the preacher might indeed command their respect, but could never excite their sympathy. It may be feared that his Sermons were less popular from another cause, imputable more to the congregation than to the pastor. Swift spared not the vice of rich or poor; and, disdaining to amuse the imaginations of his audience with discussion of dark points of divinity, or warm them by a flow of sentimental devotion, he rushes at once {{to the point of}} moral depravity, and upbraids them with their favourite and predominant vices in a tone of stern reproof, bordering upon reproach. In short, he tears the bandages from their wounds, like the hasty surgeon of a crowded hospital, and applies the incision knife and caustic with salutary, but rough and untamed severity. But, alas! the mind must be already victorious over the worst of its evil propensities, that can profit by this harsh medicine. There is <b>a</b> <b>principle</b> of opposition in our nature, which mans itself with obstinacy even against avowed truth, when it approaches our feelings in a harsh and insulting manner. And Swift was probably sensible, that his discourses, owing to these various causes, did not produce the powerful effects most grateful to the feelings of the preacher, because they reflect back to him those of the audience.|$|E
