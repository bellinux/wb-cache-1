500|$|There {{was once}} an old custom of {{removing}} one's shoes upon approaching the Wall. A 17th-century collection of special prayers to be said at holy places mentions that [...] "upon coming to the Western Wall one should remove his shoes, bow and recite...". Rabbi Moses Reicher wrote that [...] "it is a good and praiseworthy custom to approach the Western Wall in white garments after ablution, kneel and prostrate oneself in submission and recite [...] "This is nothing other than the House of God <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> gate of Heaven." [...] When within four cubits of the Wall, one should remove their footwear." [...] Over the years the custom of standing barefoot at the Wall has ceased, {{as there is no}} need to remove one's shoes when standing by the Wall, because the plaza area is outside the sanctified precinct of the Temple Mount.|$|E
