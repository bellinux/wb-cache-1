40|$|As in {{many other}} countries, {{the second half of}} the 19 th century and the first half of the 20 th century marked times of {{modernisation}} in Finland. Rapid changes also took place in the health care system at this time. Until the 1920 s most health concerns were addressed using the ethnomedical practices. New legislation gave the dominant position in health care to the Western (evidence based) health care system. According to the official record, the majority of ethnomedical treatments were declared marginal and generally useless and the state began to support the construction of hospitals. The slow pace of development in social health care held up the treatments given by legally <b>approved</b> <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners.</b> All of which supported a deliberate shift towards the modernisation of the health care system leading to primary health concerns being solved in local health care centres by doctors trained according to the conventions of evidence based medicine. Unlike many other countries, where the representatives of conventional medicine also consider complementary and alternative medicine as a part of their treatment, the use of non-evidence based medicine is extremely unusual in Finland. However, patients with long-term illnesses are eager to try all available cures in their desire to become well and this leads to a situation in which complementary treatments are used in a somewhat secretive manner. The article follows the discussion concerning the use of complementary and alternative medicine in cancer narratives in order to point out its significance as a part of a self-negotiation process characteristic to the patients with long-term illnesses...|$|R

50|$|After the war a vast {{majority}} of the PSM graduates decided not to return to Poland. In the years that followed the 209 alumni encountered several difficulties in finding suitable medical vacancies in the UK. With the big numbers of UK doctors coming back to the country, Polish doctors were in a difficult position. The situation was even more challenging because initially the Polish School of Medicine degrees were not recognised by the general medical council. The situation changed on December 18, 1947 when the British parliament passed (<b>approved?)</b> the <b>Medical</b> <b>Practitioners</b> and Pharmacists Act, 1947 which allowed PSM alumni to register and work as doctors in the UK. With the limited possibilities for satisfactory positions in Great Britain many PSM graduates ended up working outside Europe within the commonwealth (i.e. Henryk Podlewski, Lukasz Kulczycki, Jean Kryszek). Overall eventually 128 doctors settled in Great Britain. Some of them were very successful in their medical careers. Professor Henryk Urich became the head of the department of Neuropathology within the London Hospital Medical School. Henryk Maslowski was the head of Neurosurgery in Manchester. At least 11 graduates remained or returned to Edinburgh after a period in the British Colonial Service - Józef Goldberg, Kazimierz Durkacz, Stefan Adamczewski, Dawid Becher, Władysław Kluger, Maria Dobroszycka, Janina Ciekałowska, Władysław Koźmiński, Kazimierz Kuczyński, Krystyna Munk, Tadeusz Michał Kraszewski (after returning from Borneo) and Wiktor Tomaszewski. Many of the graduates stayed in the Far East and Africa (Jean Kryszek), a big number of alumni settled in the United States and Canada.|$|R

The data set contains {{information on the}} demographic and employment characteristics of <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> who were registered in Australia in 2011. Data are collected via registration forms and a survey instrument administered by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, {{in conjunction with the}} annual registration renewal process for <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners.</b> The main findings of the report are: In 2011, there were 87, 790 <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> registered in Australia, and 85. 3 % of them responded to the workforce survey. Between 2007 and 2011, the number of <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> employed in medicine increased by 17. 3 % from 67, 208 to 78, 833. In 2011, 93. 8 % (73, 980) were working as clinicians, of whom 33. 1 % were specialists and 33. 9 % were general practitioners. Of those employed as non-clinicians (6. 2 % of all employed <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners),</b> more than half were researchers (26. 9 %) or administrators (27. 7 %). Physician was the largest main speciality of practice among both clinician specialists and total specialists (5, 157 and 5, 689 respectively). The second-largest main speciality for clinician specialists and specialists (3, 951 and 4, 125 respectively) was surgery. The average weekly hours worked by employed <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> remained stable between 2007 and 2011. In 2011, male <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> worked an average of 45. 9 hours per week, while female <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> worked an average of 38. 7 hours per week. In 2011, both male and female <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> aged 20 – 34 worked the highest average weekly hours. The overall supply of clinicians across all states and territories increased between 2007 and 2011, from 323. 5 full-time equivalents per 100, 000 population in 2007 to 360. 4 in 2011. Between 2007 and 2011, there was also a rise in the supply of employed <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> in all regional areas, including Major cities, Inner regional areas, Outer regional areas and Remote/Very remote areas. The average age of <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> decreased slightly from 2007 to 2011 (45. 9 to 45. 5 years). Women are increasingly represented in the <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner</b> workforce, growing to 37. 6 % of employed practitioners in 2011 (up from 34. 0 % in 2007). Among clinicians, in 2011, women accounted for 48. 0 % of hospital non-specialists compared to 25. 6 % of specialists.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. To {{describe}} {{an outbreak of}} invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection after percutaneous needle procedures (acupuncture and joint injection) performed by a single <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner.</b> SETTING. A <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner's</b> office and 4 hospitals in Perth, Western Australia. PATIENTS. Eight individuals who developed invasive MRSA infection after acupuncture or joint injection performed by the <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner.</b> METHODS. Weperformed a prospective and retrospective outbreak investigation, including MRSA colonization surveillance, environmental sampling for MRSA, and detailed molecular typing of MRSA isolates. We performed an infection control audit of the <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner's</b> premises and practices and administered MRSA decolonization therapy to the <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner.</b> RESULTS. Eight cases of invasive MRSA infection were identified. Seven cases occurred as a cluster in May 2004; another case (identified retrospectively) occurred approximately 15 months earlier in February 2003. The primary sites of infection were the neck, shoulder, lower back, and hip: 5 patients had septic arthritis and bursitis, and 3 had pyomyositis; 3 patients had bacteremia, including 1 patient with possible endocarditis. The <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner</b> {{was found to be}} colonized with the same MRSA clone [ST 22 -MRSA-IV (EMRSA- 15) ] at 2 time points: shortly after the first case of infection in March 2003 and again in May 2004. After the <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner's</b> premises and practices were audited and he himself received MRSA decolonization therapy, no further cases were identified. CONCLUSIONS. This outbreak most likely resulted from a breakdown in sterile technique during percutaneous needle procedures, resulting in the transmission of MRSA from the <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner</b> to the patients. This report demonstrates the importance of surveillance and molecular typing in the identification and control of outbreaks of MRSA infection...|$|R
40|$|Is the palliative {{medicine}} specialist unique among <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners?</b> A {{comparative study of}} the personality of specialists in {{palliative medicine}}, surgery, anaesthesiology and general practice Background. The medical profession is very often connected {{with high levels of}} job stress and the risk of its negative consequences concerning the mental and physical health of <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners,</b> as well as the quality of help they deliver. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate whether there is a specific personality profile for <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> in palliative care and whether it is different from the personality profile for other specialists and from norms adequate to age and sex. Material and methods. A sample of 302 <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> took part in the study: 79 with specialization in palliative medicine or at a final stage prior to specialization; 84 specialists in general practice; 74 surgeons and 65 anaesthetists. Each participant was asked to complete a sociodemographic questionnaire and NEO-FFI Inventory. The level of personality traits for <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> from the above mentioned specializa-tions was marked. Results. In comparison with normal values, palliative medicine specialists had significantly lower levels of neuroticism but significantly higher for extraversion and openness to experience. What is more, extraver-sion, openness to experience and agreeableness differed in specialists in palliative medicine from other <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Conclusion.

40|$|Introduction: The {{gap between}} the {{integration}} of medical and dental care in our country is quite evident, and requires the attention of both the faculties. Postgraduate training in Oral Medicine and Radiology is available in our country since many years. However, unlike other specialists in dentistry, it is not routine for a <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner</b> to refer patients to a specialist in Oral Medicine and Radiology. An introspection regarding the present situation is essential to improve the accessibility and availability of comprehensive oral healthcare. Objective: This survey was conducted to assess the perceived need and availability of dentists and specialists in Oral Medicine and Radiology by <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> in Pune, Maharashtra. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was sent by post to 200 randomly selected <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Personal interviews were conducted among 41 <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> in private practice and 25 working at a local teaching hospital. Hence, a total of 266 <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> were approached {{for participation in the}} study. Results: Ninety-six percent of the practitioners have mentioned seeing patients with oral complaint(s) other than toothache in their practice. Thirty-four percent of the <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> referred patients with dental or other oral problems directly to the dentists, 60 % referred them after prescribing medicines, whereas, 6 % of the <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> treated such patients on their own. Sixty percent referrals were made to a general dental practitioner rather than a dental specialist. Seventy-two percent of them were not even aware of the presence of any Oral Medicine and Radiology specialists in their vicinity or city. Conclusion: <b>Medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> do perceive a need of dental practitioners for referring various oral problems. However, there seems to be little awareness among the <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> regarding the expertise and availability of specialists in Oral Medicine and Radiology. Very few referrals of oral mucosal lesions are done to the dentists, as a majority of them are done to general dental practitioners rather than to an Oral Medicine and Radiology specialist...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare {{selected}} characteristics of the Australian general <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner</b> workforce in capital cities and regional areas. Data were derived from the 1996 Census of Population and Housing. Characteristics included age, sex, full- or part-time work, place of birth and change in residential address. Analyses were performed for each state and territory in Australia, the statistical division containing each capital city and all other statistical divisions in each state and territory. Of the 26, 359 general <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> identified, 68 % were male. More female than male general <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> were aged < 45 years (74 vs 52 %, respectively; P < 0. 0001). The proportion of general <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> aged < 35 years was higher in capital cities (30 %) than regional areas (24 %; P < 0. 0001). Overall, 32 % of the general <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner</b> workforce was female and almost 50 % of those aged < 35 years were female. The proportion of female general <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> was higher in capital cities than regional areas, by up to 30 %. While 13 % of male general <b>medical</b> <b>practitioners</b> reported part-time work, 42 % of females also reported part-time work and these figures were similar in capital cities and regional areas. Approximately 40 % of the Australian general <b>medical</b> <b>practitioner</b> workforce was born outside Australia and while fewer migrants have entered in recent years they were more likely to be living in regional areas than the capitals. The census provides useful medical workforce data. The regional workforce tends to be made up of more males and is older than in capital cities. Monitoring trends in these characteristics could help to evaluate initiatives aimed at addressing regional workforce issues. 8 page(s...|$|R
