Guideline values are calculated for total uranium, 234 U, 235 U, and 238 U from analytical results from up to five datasets. Three of the datasets include results of samples analyzed using isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) and two of the datasets include results obtained using <b>alpha</b> <b>spectrometry.</b> All samples included in the statistical testing were collected from aquifer monitoring wells located within 10 miles of the RWMC.

40|$|A new rapid {{separation}} {{method that}} allows separation and preconcentration of actinides in urine samples {{was developed for}} the measurement of longer lived actinides by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and short-lived actinides by alpha spectrometry; a hybrid approach. This method uses stacked extraction chromatography cartridges and vacuum box technology to facilitate rapid separations. Preconcentration, if required, is performed using a streamlined calcium phosphate precipitation. Similar technology {{has been applied to}} separate actinides prior to measurement by <b>alpha</b> <b>spectrometry,</b> but this new method has been developed with elution reagents now compatible with ICP-MS as well. Purified solutions are split between ICP-MS and <b>alpha</b> <b>spectrometry</b> so that long- and short-lived actinide isotopes can be measured successfully. The method allows for simultaneous extraction of 24 samples (including QC samples) in less than 3 h. Simultaneous sample preparation can offer significant time savings over sequential sample preparation. For example, sequential sample preparation of 24 samples taking just 15 min each requires 6 h to complete. The simplicity and speed of this new method makes it attractive for radiological emergency response. If preconcentration is applied, the method is applicable to larger sample aliquots for occupational exposures as well. The chemical recoveries are typically greater than 90 %, in contrast to other reported methods using flow injection separation techniques for urine samples where plutonium yields were 70 - 80 %. This method allows measurement of both long-lived and short-lived actinide isotopes. 239 Pu, 242 Pu, 237 Np, 243 Am, 234 U, 235 U and 238 U were measured by ICP-MS, while 236 Pu, 238 Pu, 239 Pu, 241 Am, 243 Am and 244 Cm were measured by <b>alpha</b> <b>spectrometry.</b> The method can also be adapted so that the separation of uranium isotopes for assay is not required, if uranium assay by direct dilution of the urine sample is preferred instead.

This {{can be achieved by}} <b>alpha</b> <b>spectrometry</b> or by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after chemical separation of actinides. In the present work, laser ablation (LA) ICP-MS was combined with isotope dilution for the ultratrace level determination of 239 Pu, 240 Pu and 241 Am on the surface of targets after electroplating. 242 Pu and 243 Am were used as isotope spikes. An overall detection efficiency of better than 10 - 3 counts per atom was achieved for 238 U in LA-ICP-MS. The limits of quantification (LOQ, 10 σ) for 232 Th, U, 237 Np and Pu isotopes were comparable with or better than the detection limits of <b>alpha</b> <b>spectrometry</b> for long-lived radionuclides. Thus, the estimated detection limit for Pu was as low as 3. 6 fgg- 1 in soil after chemical separation. Comparison of LA-ICP-SFMS with <b>alpha</b> <b>spectrometry</b> yielded good agreement of Pu concentrations in moss samples at the level of 5 × 10 - 14 to 2. 5 × 10 - 13 gg- 1, but poorer coincidence was observed for 241 Am because of very low concentrations (about 2 × 10 - 14 gg- 1).

40|$|<b>Alpha</b> <b>spectrometry</b> using liquid {{scintillation}} methods has matured into a technology showing great potential. The nonpenetrating properties shared by beta and alpha radiation make them both candidates for {{liquid scintillation}} counting/spectrometry.

It was found that the response following a single addition of standard solution, at a concentration 50 % of the initial estimate, could be used to correct for the minor interference effects observed. Elevated levels of chromium (39. 5 +/- 0. 9 mu g g(- 1)), vanadium (33. 0 +/- 0. 6 mu g g(- 1)) and uranium (39. 0 +/- 1. 2 Bq kg(- 1)) were observed at Whitehaven, whilst concentrations of manganese were highest in samples from more northerly locations. The uranium enhancement is due to the extraction of phosphates from ore naturally rich in radionuclides at the nearby Albright and Wilson 'Marchon' chemical manufacturing plant. The chromium contamination may also arise from chemical manufacturing, whilst the vanadium is thought to originate from oil spillage. Interferences associated with use of the European Communities Bureau of Reference (BCR) sequential extraction protocol were investigated, and the operationally-defined speciation of chromium, manganese, nickel and vanadium was then determined. Chromium, nickel and vanadium were found mainly in association with the residual sediment phase, except at Whitehaven and Maryport where increases in the oxidizable fractions were apparent. A large proportion of the manganese at all sites was present as exchangeable species, i. e., soluble in 0. 11 mol l(- 1) acetic acid, and this was not affected by sample drying (at 60 degrees C) nor by storage (for 6 months) prior to extraction...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{consists}} of four chapters. In Chap. I，the apparatus for measuring ^ Rn concentration in soi 1 air is studied. To measure the concentration of ^ Rn in soil air，an apparatus has been developed and same four apparatuses were constructed. The apparatus is composed of a hemisphere of double screen meshes of 10 cm in diameter，gold film of 1. 0 cm in diameter centered in the hemisphere，and a silicon semiconductor detector placed {{on the opposite side}} with 0. 2 cm spacing from the gold film，an electronic circuit and a pulse height analyzer for <b>alpha</b> ray <b>spectrometry.</b> Using these apparatuses simultaneously，it is possible to obtain for radon concentrations in soil air at adequate four points under the ground from measured ^ PO count rates. From the fundamental experiments for evaluating the working characteristics of the apparatus，it was confirmed that the apparatus is useful to detect and count ^ Po in soil air，and possible to use within a long period without change their working characteristics. From the practical use of this apparatus in a soil consisted of river sand，as an estimated value of the diffusion constant of radon in soil air， 0. 081 (cm^ 2 /sec) at the depth 30 cm and 0. 092 (cm^ 2 /sec) at 100 Cln were obtained，respectively. In Chap. Ⅱ，the apparatus for continuously measuring ^ Rn exhalation from ground is studied. To measure the rate of ^ Rn exhalation from the ground surface， an apparatus has been developed. The apparatus is composed of a adon collector，a 60 - 1 cylindrical buffer tank，three kinds of filter and an onization chamber of flow-through type. To know the working characteristics and the ccuracy of measured values，calibration measurelnents and comparison between values obtained with the present method and with other methods were made by applying two-filter method and by using activated charcoal method, respectively. From the basic experments， the apparatus is capable of continuously recording measured data that provide an evaluation of ^ Rn exhalation rate with sufficient accuracy. From the practical use of the apparatus on the different ground conditions，following informations were obtained; a) The apparatus operates stably even in stormy weather. b) From the measurelnents made on the ground inside of a house，the variation trends of exhalation rate were found to be in phase with the variations of telmperature. c) From the measurelnents made on natural ground，the values on one day was considerably different from those at the same time on the other day. The variation of ground condition affected with the weather seems to be main cause to effect the variation of exhalation rates. In Chap. Ⅲ，the apparatus for measuring ^ Rn progeny concentration in atlnosphere is studied. To measure the concentration of ^ Rn progeny in atmosphere， an apparatus has been developed that {{consists of}} a radon rogeny collector，a semiconductor detector and a pulse height analyzer. A membrane filter (TOYO-ROSHI，Ltd. TM- 300) was adopted for ^ Rn progeny collection. A silicon semiconductor detector (HORIBA，Ltd. 300 SB 60 L) was adopted for alpha ray detection of ^ Rn progenies collected on the filter. <b>Alpha</b> ray <b>spectrometry</b> was adopted for the measurelnents of ^ Po and ^ Po. As a counting efficiency of this apparatus，a value 0. 459 was obtained by calculation. A relative error was estIlnated to be within 20. 4 percent. From the observations made on the atmosphere over the ocean，it was confirmed that the apparatus is useful to measure extremely low level concentrations of ^ Rn progeny with sufficient accuracy. From the observation made in the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean，followings are obtained;a) On the mid Indian Ocean，radon concentration levels were found to be ranged from 6. 6 × 10 ^ Bq/m^ 3 to 7. 6 × 10 ^ Bq/m^ 3. b) Clear inverse correlation between radon concentration and electrical conductivity was found in the atmosphere over the mid Indian Ocean. In Chap. IV，the apparatus for measuring the concentration of unattached ^ Po in atmosphere is studied. An apparatus has been developed that consists of three kinds of ^ Po measurement and others are for nattached ^ Po，and three pulse height analyzers. A 300 mesh wire screen was adopted for collection of unattached ^ Po. A membrane filter (TOYO-ROSHI，Ltd. TM- 100) was adopted for collection of attached ^ Po. Silicon semiconductor detector (HORIBA，Ltd. 300 SB 120 L) were used for alpha ray detection. As ollection efficiency of the wire mesh filter and appearing efficiency of ^ Po collected on the filter，values 0. 72 and 0. 686 were adopted in present work，respectively. From some measureluents carried out in a basenlent air，it was confirmed that the apparatus is capable of providing an evaluation of the unattached ^ Po concentration and the ratio of unattached ^ Po to attached ^ Po，simultaneously. 室蘭工業大学 (Muroran Institute of Technology) 博士（工学...|$|R
5000|$|James E. Atwater (born 1946) is {{a retired}} North American {{multidisciplinary}} physical scientist with training in geophysics, chemistry and biological science. He was awarded the Wright Brothers Medal {{for his work on}} microwave powered methods for microbial stabilization and water recovery from solid waste. Atwater served in the United States Marine Corps 1963-1967 prior to attending the University of Utah 1968-1975. In his early career 1977-1980 Atwater concentrated on methods and instrumentation for identification and quantification of radionuclides associated with uranium exploration and recovery by gamma ray and <b>alpha</b> particle energy <b>spectrometry.</b> Subsequently 1980-1987 he applied radiometric geophysical well logging techniques to the characterization of sandstone, limestone, dolomite and shale core samples. At this time he also refined methods for the determination of porosity and permeability of unconsolidated bitumen and heavy oil bearing sands. Later Atwater’s attention turned to problems of long-term human presence in space, working on regenerable systems for water and air purification, and means for decomposition and stabilization of solid waste materials and recovery of useful resources therefrom. [...] During these years Atwater and colleagues also developed novel sensors and analytical instrumentation for monitoring and control of life support systems. [...] In addition to instrumentation and methods, much of this work entailed the development of novel materials and the characterization of material properties, particularly with respect to magnetic and broadband microwave dielectric phenomena. [...] Recent research includes the study of multiphase immiscible fluid flow in porous media, and the recovery of hydrogen from methane (natural gas) using magnetically stabilized fluidized bed and microwave plasma reactors. Though in retirement, Atwater continues his association with former colleagues, providing theoretical analysis of experimental data, and preparation of materials for publication.|$|R
