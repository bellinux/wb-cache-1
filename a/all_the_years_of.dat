5|$|In 1987, Stein {{coached the}} Rockledge High School {{baseball}} team, leading them a district title with a 17–11 record. Stein {{was hired as}} {{the manager of the}} Class A-Short Season Little Falls Mets of the New York–Penn League in 1988. Little Falls were minor league affiliates of the New York Mets. In his first professional season as a manager, Stein led Little Falls to a 39–36 record. Stein commented that when he became a manager it was difficult to learn pitching after <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> being a position player. In 1989, the New York Mets fired Butch Hobson, the manager of the Class-A Columbia Mets, and promoted Stein to that position. At the helm of Colombia that year, Stein led them to a 73–67 record. He also served as a player-coach with the Orlando Juice of the Senior Professional Baseball Association in 1989.|$|E

In 1996 {{they managed to}} reach the semi-final but suffered a heavy defeat to the Auckland Blues by 48-11. From 1997 to 2002 The Bulls did not reach the final on a single occasion, at times ending last in the competition. 2003 saw them ending fifth and 2004 to 2006 saw them reach the semi-finals {{for the first time}} since 1996, but every time away from home. In 2007 they reached the final for the first time and also became the first South African team to win the Super Rugby competition by beating fellow South Africans, The Sharks, in a humdinger final in Durban. Down by 13-19, they kept the ball alive after the final hooter, taking it through various phases which eventually led to a try by Springbok winger Bryan Habana. Derick Hougaard added the conversion and The Bulls victored by 20-19. The Blue Bulls have a positive winning record against all the South African domestic sides including their arch rivals, Western Province.|$|E

It states: [...] "John Warren, a prosperous young clerk, is run down by a taxi cab while crossing a city street. The chauffeur, Allen, afraid {{of the consequences of}} his carelessness, makes his escape when he sees a crowd gathering around his victim. He abandons his machine on a lonely country road, and catching a westbound train, succeeds in making good his escape. Six years later finds John, now a cripple, living in a mining town with his devoted wife. Here John, incapacitated from other work, lives out a miserable existence as the timekeeper at the mine. Here, also, Allen comes, applying for work as a miner. They do not recognize each other. John, poor and ill, is visited by another misfortune. His beloved wife, who has clung to him through <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> his adversity, sickens and dies. His one joy in life is taken from him. John refuses to be comforted by Allen, who feels deep sympathy for the poor cripple. While reciting his sad history to Allen, John learns {{for the first time that}} Allen is the man who, by crippling him, wrecked his life. At last the vengeance he has sought all these years is within his reach. He raises his gun to end Allen's existence, when a vision of his wife appears, breathing the message, 'Vengeance is Mine, sayeth the Lord.' John rushes from the house to the grave of his loved one, and there, after forgiving Allen, dies at peace with mankind." ...|$|E

2500|$|Elizabeth's {{response}} was to take Alexis Shubin, a handsome sergeant in the Semyonovsky Guards regiment, as her lover. When Empress Anna found out about this Shubin's tongue was cut off and he was banished to Siberia. Elizabeth consoled herself with a handsome coachman {{and then turned to}} a footman for her sexual pleasure. Eventually she found her long-term companion in Alexis Razumovsky, a young and handsome Ukrainian peasant serf with a good bass voice. Razumovsky had been brought from his village to St. Petersburg by his master, a nobleman, to sing for a church choir. Elizabeth purchased the talented serf from the nobleman for her own choir. Razumovsky, a good-hearted and simple-minded man, never evidenced any personal ambition or interest in affairs of state during <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> his relationship with Elizabeth which spanned from the days of her obscurity to the height of her power as empress.
