5|$|Although not all Conservapedia {{contributors}} {{subscribe to}} a young-earth creationist point of view—former administrator Terry Koeckritz stated to the Los Angeles Times {{that he did not}} take the Genesis creation account literally—sources have attributed the poor science coverage to an overall editorial support of the young-earth creationist perspective and an over-reliance on Christian creationist home-schooling textbooks. In an analysis in early 2007, science writer Carl Zimmer found evidence that much of what appeared to be inaccurate or inadequate information <b>about</b> <b>science</b> and scientific theory could be traced back to an over-reliance on citations from the works of home-schooling textbook author Jay L. Wile.|$|E
5|$|Gernsback's {{recovery}} from the bankruptcy judgment was remarkably quick. By early June he had launched three new magazines, two of which published science fiction. The June 1929 issue of Science Wonder Stories appeared on newsstands on 5May 1929, and was followed on 5June by the July 1929 issue of Air Wonder Stories. Both magazines were monthly, with Gernsback as editor-in-chief and David Lasser as editor. Lasser had no prior editing experience and knew little <b>about</b> <b>science</b> fiction, but his recently acquired degree from MIT convinced Gernsback to hire him.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} among philosophers about many of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science, including whether science can reveal the truth about unobservable things and whether scientific reasoning can be justified at all. In addition to these general questions <b>about</b> <b>science</b> as a whole, philosophers of science consider problems that apply to particular sciences (such as biology or physics). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy itself.|$|E

5|$|Common Sense Realism {{not only}} {{dominated}} Scottish thought but {{also had a}} major impact in France, the United States, Germany and other countries. Victor Cousin (1792–1867) {{was the most important}} proponent in France, becoming Minister of Education and incorporating the philosophy into the curriculum. In Germany the emphasis on careful observation influenced Humboldt's ideas <b>about</b> <b>science</b> and was {{a major factor in the}} development of German Idealism. James McCosh (1811–94) brought Common Sense Realism directly from Scotland to North American in 1868 when he became president of Princeton University, which soon became a stronghold of the movement. Noah Porter (1811–92) taught Common Sense Realism to generations of students at Yale. As a result, it would be a major influence on the development of one of the most important offshoots of Romanticism in New England, Transcendentalism, particularly in the writing of Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–82).|$|E

25|$|The last {{philosophy}} {{book that}} Feyerabend finished is The Tyranny of Science (written 1993, published May 13, 2011). In it Feyerabend challenges {{what he sees}} in his view as some modern myths <b>about</b> <b>science,</b> e.g., {{he believes that the}} statement 'science is successful' is a myth. He argues that some very basic assumptions <b>about</b> <b>science</b> are simply false and that substantial parts of scientific ideology were created on the basis of superficial generalizations that led to absurd misconceptions about the nature of human life. He claims that far from solving the pressing problems of our age, scientific theorizing glorifies ephemeral generalities at the cost of confronting the real particulars that make life meaningful.|$|E
