40|$|Among {{bacterial}} infections, colibacillosis is {{a worldwide}} {{major cause of}} morbidity and mortality in poultry and responsible for significant economic losses to the poultry industry. Stordeur and Mainil (1) reported that the causative bacteria, avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), induce various syndromes including respiratory tract infection (airsacculitis), <b>acute</b> colisepticemia, <b>salpingitis,</b> and cellulitis. The most common form of colibacillosis occurs in 3 - to 10 -week-old chickens. It is characterized by an initial respiratory infection usually induced by mycoplasmal and/or viral infections and enhanced by a high level of ammoniac in poultry houses. The disease evolves as a systemic infection (perihepatitis, pericarditis, and septicaemia) due to the invasive abilities of the Escherichia coli strains (2) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of acute gonococcal and nongonococcal salpingitis for a five-year-period (1970 [...] 74) was studied retrospectively {{in an urban}} area of central Sweden. The investigation was undertaken {{to see if the}} reported decrease of gonorrhoea in Sweden had been followed by a change in the {{incidence of}} gonococcal salpingitis [...] the most common complication of gonorrhoea. The study showed that the relative incidence of <b>acute</b> gonococcal <b>salpingitis</b> had decreased even more than urogenital gonorrhoea and these findings thus indicate a real decrease of gonorrhoea. At the same time there were more patients with nongonococcal salpingitis. During the period of the study the gonococcal complement-fixation test (GCFT) gave positive results in 40 % to 80 % of the patients with gonococcal salpingitis. The yield with this test was only 4 % in patients with nongonococcal salpingitis during 1970 but it increased successively and was 23 % in 1974. This increase was statistically highly significant (P less than 0. 001) ...|$|R
50|$|Over {{one million}} cases of <b>acute</b> <b>salpingitis</b> are {{reported}} {{every year in}} the U.S., but the number of incidents is probably larger, due to incomplete and untimely reporting methods and that many cases are reported first when the illness has gone so far that it has developed chronic complications. For women aged 16-25, salpingitis is the most common serious infection. It affects approximately 11% of the female of reproductive age.Salpingitis has a higher incidence among members of lower socioeconomic classes. However, this is thought of being an effect of earlier sex debut, multiple partners and decreased ability to receive proper health care rather than any independent risk factor for salpingitis.As an effect of an increased risk due to multiple partners, the prevalence of salpingitis is highest for people aged 15-24 years. Decreased awareness of symptoms and less will to use contraceptives are also common in this group, raising the occurrence of salpingitis.|$|E
40|$|In 95 {{women with}} a {{provisional}} diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease, a final diagnosis of <b>acute</b> <b>salpingitis</b> was confirmed by laparoscopy in 46 and 10 had strong clinical evidence of <b>acute</b> <b>salpingitis.</b> The findings in the remaining 39 patients without signs of <b>acute</b> <b>salpingitis</b> by laparoscopy were used as a standard of reference.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the utility of serum CA 125 determinations in diagnosing <b>acute</b> <b>salpingitis.</b> Methods: CA 125 levels were determined for 34 women with the clinical diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). <b>Acute</b> <b>salpingitis</b> was confirmed laparoscopically in 28 women (82. 3 %). Results: Twenty patients (71. 4 %) with laparoscopically confirmed <b>acute</b> <b>salpingitis</b> had CA 125 levels greater than 7. 5 units, compared with no patients (0 / 6) with laparoscopically normal tubes (P = 0. 002). The degree of elevation of CA 125 levels correlated with the severity of tubal inflammation noted at laparoscopy. All patients with levels above 16 units had laparoscopically severe salpingitis. Conclusions: We conclude that while CA 125 levels above 7. 5 units may modestly improve the ability of the clinical diagnosis of PID to accurately reflect visually confirmed <b>acute</b> <b>salpingitis,</b> limitations of the test make its clinical utility questionable...|$|E
40|$|We used a {{mouse model}} of <b>acute</b> chlamydial <b>salpingitis</b> to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of roxithromycin in preventing irreversible inflammatory damage leading to tubal infertility. Female C 3 H/He mice were genitally inoculated with a human strain of Chlamydia trachomatis and then treated with roxithromycin glutamate subcutaneously. Treatment was initiated either 7 or 10 days postinfection (p. i.) and continued for 7 days at a dosage of 50 or 100 mg/kg of body weight per 24 h. The course of the disease was monitored serologically, bacteriologically, and histologically. At {{the end of the}} treatment, the mice were encaged with males and their reproductive capacity was recorded over a 19 -week period. The protective effect of roxithromycin was assessed in terms of fertility parameters in comparison with values for noninfected control mice. When treatment was initiated on day 7 p. i. and given in twice-daily 25 -mg/kg doses, all the mice remained fertile and the total number of offspring was similar to that of sham-infected mice (17. 3 +/- 3. 3 versus 17. 2 +/- 2. 3). When treatment was initiated on day 10 p. i. and given in a single daily dose of 50 or 100 mg/kg, 90 and 70 % of the mice, respectively, remained fertile; however, in terms of total offspring, fertility was lower in the group treated with the lower dose (5. 6 +/- 1. 4 versus 13. 0 +/- 3. 8). Roxithromycin was found to be effective against C. trachomatis in the mouse genital tract, but fertility was only partially preserved when the time between infection and treatment was prolonged...|$|R
40|$|<b>Acute</b> oophoritis and <b>salpingitis</b> were {{commonly}} {{observed in}} weanling mice injected intraperitoneally with murine pleuropneumonia-like organisms of the catarrhal type (4 strains).

They were also {{obtained from the}} vagina through the 5 th week and with varying results, depending on the strain, from the heart's blood through the 1 st week. PPLO injected into the vagina survived for some weeks but did not migrate inwardly nor were they transmitted outwardly to exposed mice. In male mice peritoneal abscesses were sometimes present but the genital organs were normal and free from PPLO. Otitis media, with positive exudate cultures, occurred more often in females and varied in rate with the strain of PPLO.

40|$|The {{value of}} {{cultural}} and serological procedures in diagnosing gonococcal and chlamydial infections was investigated in 85 women who had provisional diagnoses of pelvic inflammatory disease. The correlation between certain clinical variables and the absence or presence of such infections was also studied. In 46 the diagnosis of <b>acute</b> <b>salpingitis</b> was verified by laparoscopy. The laboratory and clinical findings in the patients with <b>acute</b> <b>salpingitis</b> were compared {{with those in the}} remaining 39 women in whom laparoscopy did not show signs of inflammation. Salpingitis was considered to be gonococcal if Neisseria gonorrhoeae was isolated or a fourfold or more change in titre of antibodies to gonococcus pilus antigen was found. The diagnosis of chlamydial salpingitis was based on the isolation of Chlamydia trachomatis, a fourfold or more change in titre of IgG antibodies to or from a titre of {{greater than or equal to}} 1 / 256, or the presence of IgG antibodies at a titre of greater than or equal to 1 / 512. Patients with chlamydial salpingitis had less severe symptoms but a more protracted course of disease than patients with gonococcal salpingitis or with <b>acute</b> <b>salpingitis</b> not associated with the two pathogens...|$|E
30|$|We {{performed}} five (12 %) interventions at adnexal {{level with}} one cystectomy and one salpingo-oophorectomy for cyst and three salpingectomies. Pelvic inflammatory disease {{is found in}} 5 % of laparoscopy performed to CPP. One fourth of women who had <b>acute</b> <b>salpingitis</b> will develop CPP. The aftereffect of <b>acute</b> <b>salpingitis</b> can be variable and include adhesions, hydrosalpinx, and ovarian dystrophi [2]. Ovarian cysts are found in 3 % of laparoscopy performed for CPP. Ovarian cysts are usually asymptomatic or cause acute pain. Recurrent functional ovarian cysts seem to be sometimes the cause of CPP. In our series, adnexal surgeries have been associated to another procedure except in one case of the adnexectomy for a cyst. In all those cases, the patient is pain free (group A).|$|E

40|$|More {{patients}} were hospitalised for <b>acute</b> <b>salpingitis</b> at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Orebro Medical Centre, Orebro, Sweden, during the 5 year period 1970 - 1974 (period I) {{as compared with}} that of 1980 - 1984 (period II), 666 patients and 524 respectively, a decrease of 22 %. The majority of cases, 92 % in period I and 85 % in period II, occurred among women 15 - 34 years of age, that is a relative increase of patients aged over 34 from 8 % in period I to 15 % in period II. Concomitant urogenital gonorrhoea occurred in 26. 2 % of the patients in period I compared with 12. 0 % in period II, a highly significant decrease (p less than 0. 001) mainly confined to the age group 15 - 24, whereas there was no relative difference for the two periods in the age group 25 - 34 years. The number of patients using intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) was 96 / 666 (14. 4 %) in period I compared with 113 / 524 (21. 6 %) in period II (p less than 0. 001). There were also relatively more IUCD users among the patients with gonorrhoea and <b>acute</b> <b>salpingitis</b> in period II (15. 5 %) compared with period I (10. 4 %) but this difference was not statistically significant. From 1981 to 1984 370 / 424 {{patients were}} cultured for Chlamydia trachomatis and 27. 8 % (103 / 370) were positive.

Amoxycillin/clavulanate alone was effective in 95 patients (95 %). Three patients (3 %) responded to amoxycillin/clavulanate with marked improvement but another antibiotic was subsequently added to their treatment regimen. Treatment failed in two patients. At follow-up two weeks after hospital discharge, three patients (3 - 8 %) had relapsed or were re-infected. Adverse drug events included one case of drug fever, one case of rash and one case of severe diarrhoea. Treatment was stopped in all three cases. Gastrointestinal reactions, mainly mild diarrhoea, were seen in 31 patients.

40|$|Microbiopsies of 191 fimbriae were {{obtained}} from 146 patients undergoing laparotomy for <b>acute</b> <b>salpingitis,</b> or tubal surgery after salpingitis. The biopsies were classified in four groups according to the diagnosis at laparotomy: salpingitis, distal occlusion, peritubal adhesions or tuberculosis. The biopsies belonging {{to the group of}} distal occlusion were further classified in four sub-groups according to the extent of the lesions observed during the hysterosalpingography and laparoscopy. Since the crucial role of the ciliated epithelium in the ovum transport has been established, the percentage of ciliated cells and the epithelial height were determined in the groups and compared to those observed in fimbriae obtained from fertile women during an ovulatory cycle. Significant differences were noted in all groups when compared to fertile women. <b>Acute</b> <b>salpingitis</b> provoked a rapid and severe deciliation which recovered 3 months after triantibiotherapy.

Of the 133 women with laparoscopically verified salpingitis, 52 (39 %) were HIV- 1 –seropositive. Tubo-ovarian abscesses (TOA) were found in 33 % of HIV- 1 –infected and 15 % of HIV- 1 –uninfected women (odds ratio [OR], 2. 8; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 2 – 6. 5). Among seropositive women, TOA was found in 55 % of those with CD 4 cell percent! 14 % vs. 28 % with CD 4 cell percent 114 % (OR 3. 1, 95 % CI 0. 6 – 15. 3).

40|$|<b>Acute</b> <b>salpingitis</b> complicating {{cervical}} gonococcal {{infection is}} a significant cause of infertility. Relatively little data are available concerning the pathophysiologic mechanisms of this disease. A cohort of 243 prostitutes residing in Nairobi were followed between March 1985 and April 1988. Gonococcal cultures were performed at each visit, and <b>acute</b> <b>salpingitis</b> was diagnosed clinically. Serum at enrollment was tested by immunoblot for antibody to gonococcal outer membrane proteins. 8. 6 % (146 / 1689) of gonococcal infections were complicated by salpingitis. Increased risk of salpingitis was associated with younger age, shorter duration of prostitution, HIV infection, number of gonococcal infections, and episodes of nongonococcal salpingitis. Rmp antibody increased the risk of salpingitis. Antibody to Opa decreased the risk of salpingitis. By logistic regression analysis, antibody to Opa was independently associated with decreased risk of gonococcal salpingitis (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0. 35; 95 % confidence interval [95 %CI], 0. 17 - 0. 76); HIV infection (adjusted OR, 3. 5; 95 % CI, 0. 96 - 12. 8) and episodes of nongonococcal salpingitis (adjusted OR, 3. 4; 95 % CI, 1. 8 - 6. 4) were independently {{associated with an increased}} risk of salpingitis.
