40|$|This study {{examines}} mock jurors’ {{perceptions of a}} young witness according {{to whether or not}} he was described <b>as</b> having <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> disability. Our study examined perceptions of a child witness younger (five or seven years) than previously studied. Mock jurors (n = 71) viewed a short video excerpt of a boy recalling a personally experienced event, and then rated him across nine domains of eyewitness ability. The boy was described <b>as</b> either having <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> disability or typically developing. Participants rated the child more negatively on dimensions relating to cognitive competence, but not trustworthiness, when he was presented <b>as</b> having <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> disability. Participants also watched the child answer a series of suggestive questions; when described <b>as</b> having <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> disability he was rated as less accurate in responding to these. The findings have implications for the involvement of children with intellectual disabilities within the legal system...|$|R

5|$|Returning to education, Mao {{enrolled}} {{and dropped}} out of a police academy, a soap-production school, a law school and an economics school. His father only approved of the latter, but the lectures were in English, which Mao didn't understand, and so Mao abandoned it for the government-run Changsha Middle School; he soon {{dropped out of}} this too, finding it rooted in Confucianism. Undertaking his studies independently, he spent {{much time in the}} Changsha public library, reading core works of classical liberalism such as Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations and Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws, as well as the works of western scientists and philosophers such as Charles Darwin, J.S. Mill, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Herbert Spencer. Viewing himself <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>intellectual,</b> years later he admitted that at this time he thought himself better than working people. Inspired by the work of Friedrich Paulsen, the liberal emphasis on individualism led Mao to believe that strong individuals were not bound by moral codes but should strive for the greater good; that the end justifies the means. Seeing no use in his son's intellectual pursuits, Mao's father cut off his allowance, forcing Mao to move into a hostel for the destitute.|$|E

25|$|Another major {{influence}} on Dürer’s works was {{the rise of}} Nuremberg <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> center and {{as a leader in}} engravings. One of the main reasons behind Nuremberg's prominence was the release of the Nuremberg Chronicle in 1493. This book contained around 650 original illustrations from Michael Wolgemut, one of the leading engravers of the late-Gothic era, and his workshop. The Nuremberg Chronicle not only demonstrated the capabilities of the new printing press, but also {{paved the way for the}} work of Albrecht Dürer in the coming years.|$|E

25|$|As {{the capital}} of the new kingdom, Brussels also {{attracted}} a large number of Walloon migrants. In contrast to Flemish citizens of Brussels, who came primarily from the lower social classes, the Walloon newcomers belonged mainly to the middle class. The Walloon and French migrants lived predominantly in the Marollen district of Brussels, where Marols, a mixture of Brabantian Dutch, French, and Walloon, was spoken. Despite the fact that many lower-class Walloons also made their way to Brussels, the perception of French <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> and elite language did not change.|$|E
25|$|Paine's writing greatly {{influenced}} his contemporaries and, especially, the American revolutionaries. His books provoked an upsurge in Deism in America, {{but in the}} long term inspired philosophic and working-class radicals in the UK and US. Liberals, libertarians, Left-libertarians, feminists, democratic socialists, social democrats, anarchists, free thinkers, and progressives often claim him <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> ancestor. Paine's critique of institutionalized religion and advocacy of rational thinking influenced many British free thinkers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, such as William Cobbett, George Holyoake, Charles Bradlaugh, Christopher Hitchens and Bertrand Russell.|$|E

25|$|The Age of Enlightenment {{is a time}} in Western {{philosophy}} and cultural life centered upon the 18th century in which reason was advocated as the primary source and legitimacy for authority. Enlightenment gained momentum more or less simultaneously {{in many parts of}} Europe and America. Developing during the Enlightenment era, Renaissance humanism <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>intellectual</b> movement spread across Europe. The basic training of the humanist was to speak well and write (typically, {{in the form of a}} letter). The term umanista comes from the latter part of the 15th century. The people were associated with the studia humanitatis, a novel curriculum that was competing with the quadrivium and scholastic logic.|$|E

Reading Jane's diaries and letters, Carlyle was struck by her unhappiness and his own irritability and inconsideration for her, and he decided to atone by writing her a memorial. In 1871, Carlyle gave Froude this memorial along with a bundle of Jane's personal papers, to be published after Carlyle's death, if Froude so decided. Also, Carlyle appointed Froude one of his own literary executors, although he was (perhaps intentionally) ambiguous in his instructions.|$|E
