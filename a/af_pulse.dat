40|$|AF) is {{the most}} common heart rhythm {{disorder}} with about 800, 000 cases currently diagnosed in England. 1 AF is associated with a multitude of symptoms including palpitations, breathlessness and fatigue. It causes serious discomfort to the patient and increases the risk of stroke by 500 %. Without adequate anti-coagulation, nearly one in every twenty AF patients is expected to suffer a stroke each year. 2 Furthermore, it is estimated that AF costs the NHS £ 1. 8 billion annually. 3 Despite the high stroke risk associated with the condition, AF remains severely under-diagnosed. It is estimated that up to half of people with AF are still undetected and live in great danger of suffering disabling and often fatal strokes, heart failure or other serious complications. A simple manual pulse check {{is one of the most}} effective ways of detecting suspected <b>AF.</b> <b>Pulse</b> checks can be delivered in a variety of settings, ranging from GP surgeries to flu clinics, pharmacies and libraries. This report was produced on the back of a nationwide survey of Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) and aims to showcase the most original ideas and best practice in delivering opportunistic pulse checks. We would encourage commissioners and healthcare professionals from across the country to take note of these examples and explore the feasibility of implementing some of these ideas in their localities. Through carrying out more opportunistic pulse checks and improving AF detection rates, we will not only help identify those with AF but also help to prevent much of the human suffering associated with AF-related strokes, and assist the NHS to meet its efficiency challenge set out in the Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention (QIPP) programme.

40|$|Gastric Palsy Following AF Vagal Ablation. We {{report a}} case of a 55 -year-old man with vagal {{paroxysmal}} atrial fibrillation (AF) who was submitted to selective epicardial and endocardial atrial vagal denervation with the objective of treating <b>AF.</b> Radiofrequency <b>pulses</b> were applied on epicardial and endocardial surface of the left atrium close to right pulmonary veins (PVs) and also on epicardial surface close to left inferior PV. Following the procedure, patient presented with symptoms of gastroparesis, which was documented on CT scan and gastric emptying scintigraphy. Symptoms were transient and the patient recovered completely...|$|R
40|$|A 45 year-old female was {{admitted}} to the hospital because of epistaxis, ecchymoses and gum bleeding. A review of her prior history revealed that she was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) type-II, 5 years ago. The signs and symptoms of DM were fairly controlled with glibenclamide 15 mg daily. Findings during her last visit were: fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 205 mg/dl and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 C) 8. 5 %. Her medical history also showed that last month she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF> 45 %) and was placed on warfarin 5 mg and propranolol 80 mg daily, which resulted in resolution of <b>AF,</b> a <b>pulse</b> rate of 80 bps and INR of 3 (target INR 2 - 3). A week prior to her admission, she had a visit to her family physician, complaining of symptoms of hyperglycemia (e. g. polyurea, polydipsia, etc). At that time, her FPG wa...|$|R
40|$|A ticking {{sound is}} {{described}} as the third acoustic component of the defense behaviour of the giant weta, Deinacrida rugasa Buller. The ticks occur at a mean interval of 8. 36 s, but arc not correlated with any movements visible to the unaided eye. The ticks contain a mean <b>af</b> 5. 4 <b>pulses</b> which decrease in amplitude but which have similar waveforms and perisdicities. Spectral analysis indicated that ticking sounds, as well as pulses from defensive leg-kicking stridulatory sounds, are characterised by a 12 kHz peak. Tt is concluded that ticking is produced by the femoro-abdominal stridulatory mechanism but that extremely small leg movements are involved...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThe active can, {{unipolar}} right ventricular (RV) single lead {{system has}} been shown to be very effective for ventricular defibrillation using an RV+→ CAN–biphasic pulsing configuration. If this same RV+→ CAN–unipolar system could perform double-duty, providing atrial as well as ventricular defibrillation, it would broaden the role of current implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). It would provide an atrial ICD without multiple shock electrodes, simultaneously providing backup protection for inadvertent induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) following atrial defibrillation. Methods and ResultsThe purpose of this study was to determine the RV+→ CAN–atrial defibrillation threshold at the time of ICD surgery for 10 VTNFpatients using the Medtronic 7219 C ICD shell with a biphasic 65 % tilt, 60 μF capacitance pulse delivered one minute following induction of <b>AF.</b> Initial <b>pulse</b> strength was 100 V and was incremented in 100 V steps every minute if atrial fibrillation persisted. The atrial defibrillation threshold data with the RV+→ CAN–system were 8. 3 ± 4. 1 joules, 511 ± 128 volts, and 58 ± 8 ohms. ConclusionsAlthough the RV+→ CAN–lead system does not provide atrial defibrillation at energies likely to be painless (e. g., < 0. 2 J), the safety and simplicity of this system has advantages that must be considered when compared to more complicated two and three lead elegtrode systems. If detection algorithms for AF, using near and far field electrogram analysis prove accurate, such a simple lead system may prove clinicallyviable...|$|R
5|$|The game {{opens in}} 3 <b>AF,</b> as the <b>Pulse</b> town Serah lives in is {{attacked}} by monsters. A stranger named Noel appears {{to help fight}} the monsters and {{claims to be a}} time traveler from 700 AF. He arrived in her time via Valhalla, where he claims to have met Lightning as she guarded the throne of the weakened Etro. As part of Lightning's transfer to Valhalla, she was erased from the fall of Cocoon onwards (making everyone except Serah forget her being with them on Gran Pulse), and paradoxes have erupted throughout time, warping the timeline. Serah joins Noel in a journey to resolve these paradoxes by removing items and monsters, which are out of their original time and correct the timeline; she in hopes of finding her sister and he in hopes of changing the bleak future he comes from. While journeying to 5 AF to resolve a paradox on Cocoon, they meet and help Alyssa, an Academy member and survivor of the Purge, a massacre by the Sanctum at the beginning of Final Fantasy XIII.|$|R
40|$|Background Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) {{is associated}} with a high risk of stroke and may often be asymptomatic. AF is commonly undiagnosed until patients present with sequelae, such as heart failure and stroke. Stroke secondary to AF is highly preventable with the use of appropriate thromboprophylaxis. Therefore, early identification and appropriate evidence-based management of AF could lead to subsequent stroke prevention. This study aims to determine the feasibility and impact of a community pharmacy-based screening programme focused on identifying undiagnosed AF in people aged 65  years and older. Methods and analysis This cross-sectional study of community-based screening to identify undiagnosed AF will evaluate the feasibility of screening for <b>AF</b> using a <b>pulse</b> palpation and handheld single-lead electrocardiograph (ECG) device. 10 community pharmacies will be recruited and trained to implement the screening protocol, targeting a total of 1000 participants. The primary outcome is the proportion of people newly identified with AF at the completion of the screening programme. Secondary outcomes include level of agreement between the pharmacist's and the cardiologist's interpretation of the single-lead ECG; level of agreement between irregular rhythm identified with pulse palpation and with the single-lead ECG. Process outcomes related to sustainability of the screening programme beyond the trial setting, pharmacist knowledge of AF and rate of uptake of referral to full ECG evaluation and cardiology review will also be collected...|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: The {{majority}} of patients with chronic kidney disease (1) stage 3 are managed in non-specialist centres but most studies of CKD are conducted in Nephrology Departments in secondary care. Moreover, subjects ~ 75 years, which make up a large proportion, are often excluded. We undertook a detailed prospective study of unselected patients in primary care to fill the knowledge gap regarding CKD stage 3 and to identify factors that may be independent determinants of cardiovascular disease (CVO) and progressive CKD in this setting. Design, setting, participants and measurements: Subjects with eGFR 59 - 30 mUmin/ 1. 73 m 2 were recruited from 32 Primary Care Practices. Medical history and demographic data were obtained and participants underwent clinical assessment including blood pressure, anthropomorphic measurements, skin autofluorescence (<b>AF)</b> and <b>pulse</b> wave velocity (PWV) as well as extensive urine and serum biochemistry. Results: 1741 participants were included: mean age 72. 9 ± 9 yrs; 60 % (n= 1052) female; 97. 5 % (n= 1698) white; 17 % (n= 294) diabetic. Mean eGFR was 52. 5 ± 10 mLs/min/ 1. 73 m 2 and 16. 9 % had microalbuminuria or more severe proteinuria. 77 % had CKD stage 3 A and 64. 5 % (n= 1123) received RAASi treatment. 22. 2 % (n= 387) {{had a history of}} cardiovascular events and 55 % (n= 950) were past or current smokers. Analysis identified participants with CKD stage 38, diabetes and age " 275 years evidencing a higher risk profile for CKD progression and cardiovascular events than people with CKD stage 3 A, those without diabetes or participants < 75 years. 67 % of participants required further medical intervention following their study feedback. Most required improved control of hypertension (n= 576, 33. 1 % of cohort). Less than 6 % of participants met NICE criteria for referral to nephrology services. 41 % were unaware of their CKD diagnosis. Subjects with formal educational qualifications, age < 75 years, eGFR 30 - 44 mUmin! 1. 73 m 2 and significant albuminuria were identified as more likely to be aware of their diagnosis. Analysis of skin AF and PVVV readings revealed significant correlations with several potential risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVO) and progression of CKD. Conclusion: The RRID study provides unique insights into patients with CKO stage 3 in primary care. Clinical characteristics are distinct from subjects generally seen in Nephrology Departments. Follow up over 10 years will assess the predictive value {{of a wide range of}} risk factors and yield valuable data complementary to that derived from studies conducted in secondary care.
