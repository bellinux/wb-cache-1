40|$|Background: {{little is}} known about the {{longitudinal}} course of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and how this differs from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Method: standardized baseline and <b>annual</b> <b>assessments</b> of cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms are reported in a cohort of 72 patients with DLB or AD. AD was diagnosed using the NLNCDS ADRDA criteria and DLB was diagnosed with the criteria of McKeith et al. Cognitive assessment was undertaken using the MMSE schedule and operationalized definitions were used to diagnose non-cognitive symptoms. Results: 42 patients with DLB and 30 patients with AD were assessed. Of the 19 on whom post mortem examinations have been performed, 18 (95 %) have had the clinical diagnosis confirmed. DLB patients were significantly more likely to experience visual hallucinations, disturbances of consciousness and parkinsonism at both baseline and at <b>annual</b> <b>assessments.</b> Of DLB patients exposed to neuroleptics, 33 % developed sensitivity reactions.

Getting little or no food but cassava cakes and 'guango' of maize, and now and then a little coffee and salt fish, without time to hunt the game which passed him, and continually wet through, he stumbled in suddenly on one squatting after another, to the astonishment of its owner, who could not conceive how he had been found out, and had never before seen a white man alone in the forest. Sometimes he was in considerable danger of a rough reception from people who could not at first understand what they had to gain by getting legal titles, and buying the lands the fruit of which they had enjoyed either for nothing, or for payment of a small <b>annual</b> <b>assessment</b> for the cultivated portion.

Given the recent uncertainties in the catch based assessment of the stock, survey based abundance estimates of ages 5 + cod, generated by calibrating the survey indices with converged estimates from a VPA, were compared with the estimates from the <b>annual</b> <b>assessments.</b> The {{results indicate that the}} survey based estimates were more accurate than the estimates from the <b>annual</b> <b>assessments.</b> Since the survey and the VPA abundance estimates for younger cod were. inconsistent, the amount of information contained in the surveys was tested indirectly by determining how well estimates based on previous survey indices could predict the following year's survey value. A time series model of the ages 3 + cod and haddock survey indices predicted the subsequent value of the cod survey index fairly accurately. Furthermore, the Lofoten acoustic survey indicates a much greater decrease in spawning stock size {{over the last several years}} than do the VPA estimates.
