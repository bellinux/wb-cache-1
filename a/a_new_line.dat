5|$|Stichometry was {{sometimes}} confused with colometry, {{the practice of}} some Christian authors in late antiquity of writing texts broken into rhetorical phrases to aid delivery.

For historical purposes, the Manville to Newark tracks is considered <b>a</b> <b>new</b> rail <b>line</b> and not the original line and the Norfolk Southern part is considered the original <b>line</b> and not <b>a</b> <b>new</b> rail <b>line.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>line</b> to Rodeløkka {{was opened}} on 3 January 1955. The bus {{operation}} {{had been more}} expensive than the tram, and a double track line was built from Carl Berners plass through Dælenenggata to Rodeløkka. The balloon loop was built around the block of Dælenengata, Fagerheimgata, Marstrandgata and Københavngata. The line was connected to the old Rodeløkka Line with a triangular loop in Københavngata. On 23 April 1961, all traffic on the Rodeløkka Line was terminated. The tracks were removed between 1962 and 1964.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th century, the Surrey villages of Wimbledon and Sutton {{experienced}} rapid residential growth, stimulated by the railways running through their areas, with landowners in both areas profiting from the development of new suburban housing on their previously rural estates. Less accessible to the railways, the parishes of Merton and Morden, which lay between Wimbledon and Sutton, remained largely rural and, starting in the 1880s, a series of railway schemes were proposed to bring <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>line</b> through the area and increase the value of the land.|$|E
5|$|For the Japanese, {{the loss}} of the Admiralties meant {{the loss of}} their outpost line in the South Eastern Area. Imperial Headquarters now ordered the {{preparation}} of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>line</b> in Western New Guinea. The Admiralties operation also indicated the Allies were becoming more ambitious and might bypass Hansa Bay. Accordingly, the Eighteenth Army in New Guinea was ordered to prepare to defend Aitape and Wewak as well.|$|E

5|$|However, {{no further}} tram lines were closed. In 1969, {{the site of}} the turning loop at Sinsen needed to be moved to allow the {{construction}} of the Sinsen Interchange. Instead of closing the line, Oslo Sporveier chose to build a new loop at Muselunden at Sinsen. The Ekeberg Line was scheduled to close in 1972, because <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>line</b> needed to be built to allow passage during the construction of Oslo Central Station, which would replace the Østbanen. After heavy protests from Ekeberg residents, Oslo Sporveier chose to build a loop in Vognmannsgata in the city centre.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{there were}} rumours that Heather Mills was {{in talks with}} Gardein to {{publicise}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>line</b> of products. This was considered noteworthy at the time, as a preceding mock meats company, Linda McCartney Foods, was established by Linda McCartney (who was married to Paul McCartney. McCartney is also Mills' ex-partner). Mills had previously courted controversy in 2002 as people perceived her plans to write a vegetarian cookbook as mimicry of McCartney's own bestselling vegetarian cookbook.|$|E
5|$|In {{the closing}} days of World War I, the Conference of Ambassadors drew the first {{demarcation}} line between Poland and Lithuania on June 18, 1919.

These attacks coincided with {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Versailles on June 28, which eliminated any danger from Germany. Attempting to halt further hostilities, Marshal of France Ferdinand Foch proposed <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>line,</b> known as the Foch Line, on July 18, 1919.|$|E

The first horse-drawn railway in the Kingdom of Hungary, from Pressburg to Szentgyörgy Svätý Jur, was built in 1840. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>line</b> to Vienna using steam locomotives was opened in 1848, and a line to Pest in 1850. Many new industrial, financial and other institutions were founded; for example, the first bank in present-day Slovakia was founded in 1842.

5|$|Manchester {{became the}} first city in the UK to acquire a modern light rail tram system when the Manchester Metrolink opened in 1992.

Its {{high-end}} M-series product line was introduced in 1992. It also expanded internationally, especially in Asia. Monster had a Taiwanese distributor file its trademark in the region, {{which led to the}} distributor continuing to sell products under the Monster brand after their agreement with Monster was terminated. This led to a lengthy legal battle and eventually a settlement. Monster acquired the Entec in-car audio brand in 1998.|$|E
