5|$|As a Long Island Rail Road station {{it served}} as one of two {{junctions}} between the Far Rockaway and Rockaway Beach Branches. The other junction was at Hammels Station, although it was originally a junction for the Far Rockaway Branch and the Ocean Electric Railway. Hammels is now located where Hammels Wye is.

5|$|Burial customs, {{at least}} in {{southern}} Poland, included raising kurgans. The urn with the ashes {{was placed on the}} mound or on a post thrust into the ground.

All dead, regardless of social status, were cremated and afforded a burial, according to Arab testimonies (one {{from the end of the}} 9th century <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> from about 930). A Slavic funeral feast practice was also mentioned earlier by Theophylact Simocatta.|$|E

5|$|A {{settlement}} and cemetery of the Lengyel-Polgár cultural zone, dated around or after 4600 BCE, {{was discovered in}} Ślęza, Wrocław County. It consisted of a central long trapezoidal house accompanied by several post-built supporting structures. Among the large explored settlements of the Lengyel culture from the 4400-4000 BCE period, there is one in Brześć Kujawski, <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> in Osłonki, solidly fortified about 4200 BCE after an assault incident involving arson and murder, both located in the Kujawy region. At the Osłonki settlement nearly 30 trapezoidal houses and over 80 graves were located, some of them with many copper ornaments. The agricultural and construction activities of the communities centered on the two large settlements (hunting and fishing were also practiced) caused very likely an accumulation of environmental damage, which eventually forced them to abandon the area. 4th millennium BC constructions reinforced with ditches and palisades and ceramics molded into figural representations of the Lengyel-Polgár culture were located in Podłęże, Wieliczka County.|$|E

In early April 1669 Pivljanin and Puhalović raised and looted in Herzegovina, and retreated towards Šipan. According to legend, he burnt down a mosque in Nevesinje, <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> in Počitelj. There are accounts recorded by the anthropologist Jevto Dedijer that several Muslim families left their homes after cruel treatment by Pivljanin; the Šehović left Korjenići and moved to south Herzegovina after he and Limun burnt down their house; the Kajtaz and Rorić left Nevesinje and moved to Mostar, {{and a large number}} of the families of Slivlja left their homes. The war ended with Ottoman victory in 1669, with Venice being forced to relinquish all of the territory taken over by the uskoks and hajduks during the war, with only Klis becoming a new Venetian possession. The Venetian–Ottoman border delineation act was signed on 30 October 1671.|$|E
5|$|Preceded by the {{publication}} of the re-mastered editions of their first four albums, Girlschool released the studio album Believe in July 2004. The wish to explore new territories is obvious in some tracks of the album, which is the first one entirely composed by the new line-up at Chambers’ home studio. The changed line-up brought a new balance in the band, with Chambers involved in the composition of all songs. Moreover, the chance to use again two lead singers led to improvements in the vocal and choral parts. Unfortunately, the album was poorly distributed and remained unknown to large parts of its potential audience. In 2005, the band re-released Believe in a new package with a DVD containing footage taken from concerts of the 2000s and sold it through their official website. A US and European tour followed Believe first release, but the project for releasing in 2004 a live DVD tentatively titled Girlschool Live at the Garage never materialised. In June 2005, Girlschool did a UK tour with Vixen <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> in November–December with old pals Motörhead, celebrating Lemmy's band 30th anniversary. During the same year, they were also on stage at summer festivals in the Netherlands and England and opened for Alice Cooper in Spain.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg {{had been}} an Ottoman sanjakbey, who {{defected}} from the empire and united several Albanian princes under the League of Lezhë. From Krujë, his main fort, he {{led the league in}} the Ottoman-Albanian wars. Having defeated the Ottomans in many battles he allied with Western Christian states and leaders, especially with Alfonso V of Aragon and the Papal States. On 14 August 1464, Pope Pius II, one of Skanderbeg's major benefactors, died and his plans for a crusade against the Ottoman Empire disintegrated. The alliances and promises for help from the major Christian powers were canceled {{with the exception of the}} Kingdom of Hungary under Matthias Corvinus and the Republic of Venice. Sultan Mehmed II realized the power vacuum created after Pius died and he tried to take advantage of the situation. He thus attempted to sign a peace agreement with Hungary and Venice so that his forces could focus on Albania to gain a base for future campaigns in the Italian peninsula. His efforts were unsuccessful, however, since neither Venice nor Hungary accepted his proposed treaty. Mehmed thus kept his armies stationed in the Balkans, one force near Jajce in Bosnia, one in Ohrid, <b>and</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> in the Morea.|$|E
