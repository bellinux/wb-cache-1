5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, they tend to be totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E

2500|$|When Yuan Shu {{heard of}} Lu Su's fame, {{he wanted to}} recruit him {{to serve as the}} Chief of Dongcheng County (東城縣) under him. However, Lu Su saw that Yuan Shu's {{administration}} was ill-disciplined and believed that Yuan would not be successful. He told his followers, [...] "The central government has failed. Robbers and bandits are rampant. The areas around the Huai and Si rivers are no longer safe. I heard the lands in Jiangdong are fertile, its population is prosperous, and its army is powerful. We can take shelter there. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> accompany me to that paradise and wait until the situation here stabilises?" [...] They unanimously agreed to follow him.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} Everest took shape in Gowariker's mind around {{two years before}} the telenovela was made. At that time he was {{confused}} between the themes of female empowerment and the fairly obscure sport of mountaineering. As he could not proceed with either of them individually, Gowariker combined the two themes into one, creating the theme of Everest. Gowariker stated that: [...] "The whole idea of the show actually began with an insight that what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> do for your dreams?" [...] Before starting the shooting of Everest, Gowariker had to do a great deal of research. The makers referred to books such as To Everest and Beyond (by Edmund Hillary) and accounts by various other mountaineers, a few of whom they met personally. Mitali Mahajan, who co-wrote the story and the screenplay of the show, said: [...] "There are 14 peaks that have an elevation of over 8,000 meters and some enthusiastic people have climbed them all. A lot of them have live blogs about their journey through these peak. We have been following a lot of them." ...|$|E
