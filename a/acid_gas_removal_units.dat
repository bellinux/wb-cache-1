Aqueous amine solutions are proven to be practical solvents {{for the treatment of}} natural gas. By simply changing their amine solutions, many inefficient <b>acid</b> <b>gas</b> <b>removal</b> <b>units</b> can be optimized. Acid gas removal unit (AGRU) simulation is an essential tool for control and operations in gas processing plant because {{it can be used to}} stimulate and analyses the under different operating conditions. In this study, Monoethanolamine (MEA), Dietanolamine (DEA) and Methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) will be use to model the acid gas removal unit process by using Aspen Hysys. MEA is effective at removing almost all hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide among the other amines. Meanwhile, DEA and MDEA allows for some carbon dioxide to be left in the sweet gas that are suit for gas steams with less stringent product specifications. Accordingly, the heat consumption at the regenerator was in the following order MEA >DEA > MDEA. Improvement studies were extended to the effect of increasing the circulation rate, amines concentration and reboiler heat consumption. By increasing the circulation rate, MEA causes the CO 2 to be almost completely absorbed in the column even at the lowest low circulation rate followed by DEA and. MDEA. By increasing concentration of amine, MEA and MDEA showed at 15 wt % or greater is required to achieve the specified acid gas removal and 25 wt % for DEA. One also can reduce heat of reaction by changing from a primary to secondary amine which both gives almost the same acid gas removal efficiency. This research can broaden by using different simulation tools available model the AGRU and also perform the comparison on the cost estimating for MEA, DEA and MDEA...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{extensive}} {{review of}} <b>acid</b> <b>gas</b> <b>removal</b> <b>units</b> covering 5 decades {{and more than}} 120 amine units showed that units treating sweet gases (i. e. with CO 2 only) presented the worst risks of corrosion. In some extreme cases, a quite uniform corrosion in an active mode was observed on stainless steel grades such as AISI 410 and 304 L, despite apparently mild corrosive conditions. Strong scaling of the heat exchangers by corrosion products was also observed. A detailed analytical survey of those corrosive DEA units was then performed over more than two years. Immediately after fresh solvent swap, dissolved iron concentration increased until stabilization at several hundreds of mg/L after a few months. Good correlation was found between dissolved iron, amine degradation, {{and the amount of}} scaling products that was recovered in the heat exchangers. Comparisons with similar units using activated MDEA revealed dissolved iron levels several orders of magnitude below those in DEA. In order to understand more precisely the driving forces for steel corrosion and for the precipitation of corrosion products, a laboratory program was launched. Comparisons between different amines in rich and lean conditions were performed in autoclave. A specific protocol was developed which aimed at degrading the amine solutions and at providing dissolved iron before corrosion tests to image the degradation of industrial solvent in actual life of plant. The laboratory degraded DEA was successfully compared to an industrial DEA solution sampled in a gas sweetening unit experiencing corrosion problems. Active corrosion of carbon steel (CS), AISI 410 and even AISI 304 L was reproduced in laboratory conditions with hot rich DEA and with industrial DEA solution as well. Industrial trends of strong precipitation of iron carbonate in the amine - amine exchangers could be explained. Iron solubility was found to depend on amine loading, with a lower solubility in rich conditions, thus a strong tendency to precipitate. Based on a the same protocol to obtain degraded MDEA and energizedMDEA, the study further looked at the behavior of those commonly used amines made of on the shelf and generic amine molecules. The experience and know-how gathered from the feed-back, inspection and laboratory experiments is applied to understand the performance of existing units, for which carbon steel has been used extensively. When improvements are welcome, the key corrosion mitigating issues are exposed in term of appropriate amine selection for sweet or sour gases, flow velocities and procedures for solvent preservation. The article also discusses about material selection and replacement of carbon steel by appropriate corrosion resistant alloy (CRA) when needed and only on selected areas, as normal maintenance operations following periodic inspections. This considerably extends the service life, while also enabling operation above the initial specifications. For newly built compact units, the design criteria focus on application of AISI 316 L, now preferred instead of lower grades like 304 L or AISI 410, to areas potentially prone to corrosion. With appropriate use of CRA's, acid gas loadings of 0. 85 or even higher can be considered in design, without velocity limitations on the rich amine lines or stringent material selection. Furthermore, the amine units based on the AdvamineTM technologies remain fully versatile and flexible to encompass the widest range of amines, including MDEA and energizedMDEA...|$|E

One of these chemical solvents is a kind of tertiary amine called MDEA. The main goal of this master thesis is modeling an <b>acid</b> <b>gas</b> <b>removal</b> plant using MDEA. At first, a brief explanation about Natural gas chain in Norwegian continental shelf is given, then a bibliographical research was made regarding <b>acid</b> <b>gas</b> <b>removal</b> processes; in addition, some criteria for selection of proper <b>acid</b> <b>gases</b> <b>removal</b> process are discussed. Asg&# 229;rd B has an offshore absorption unit to remove selective <b>acid</b> <b>gas</b> using FLEXORB- a solvent which is used to remove selectively H 2 S. Another solvent that can be used in the absorption process to remove H 2 S selectively is MDEA. In this project, MDEA is replaced with FLEXORB to observe the solvent behavior from different angles in the Asg&# 229;rd B <b>acid</b> <b>gas</b> <b>removal</b> <b>unit.</b> For this purpose, a simulation of the process has been done in which MDEA was used as a solvent and the obtained results will be discussed. The simulation of this plant is designed based on the data collected from Statoil. Unisim software has been chosen to simulate amine based <b>acid</b> <b>gas</b> <b>removal</b> <b>unit.</b> It has also been tried to optimize the process. To do so, heat exchanger network was designed using Pinch Analysis method and the required external energy has been calculated. It helps to use heat flows of the streams in the process in order not to waste the energy. Finally, it is concluded that required recycled flow rate of MDEA is much more than FLEXORB and consequently, the required make up water for MDEA solvent will be more than required water in the process using FLEXORB. Furthermore, FLEXORB acts more selectively than MDEA in the case of H 2 S removal. Changing different parameters in the simulation shows that (i) inlet lean amine temperature entering the absorber does not affect the absorption process, (ii) increasing of heat duty in the reboiler of regenerator decreases <b>acid</b> <b>gases</b> in the treated gas, (iii) lean amine flow rate with an acceptable loading has a direct effect on the product quality.

In addition, the impact for the integration of IGCC with activated carbons-based pressure swing adsorption carbon capture process is investigated by using a PSA model developed and validated by University of Birmingham. A simplified zero dimension gasification model is developed based on Texaco gasifier and validated by reference and industry data. The model development is based on mass balance, chemical equilibrium and energy balance. The prediction results for syngas contents concentrations are proved to be reasonably acceptable and the syngas contents changes with key input parameters changes are studied. The model is then used to generate a variable syngas stream to study the dynamic performance of the other sub-modules. A one dimension dynamic model based on Shell slagging gasifier is developed. The model can successfully show the characteristics of slag layers formation and the syngas stream change with response to input parameters change. By using step rise of oxygen input and steam blast input, the dynamic performance of syngas temperature, syngas contents, slag mass flow rate and slag layers thickness is analysed and compared. It is found that oxygen input show relative larger impact on gasifier operation than steam blast for the studied working conditions.

The sour gas will flow through the absorption-adsorption column and at the same time, amine solvent flow through that column countercurrently with the gas. Amine solvent flows using the circulation pump at the flowrate 120 L/hr. For parameter MEA/MDEA mixture composition, five different ratios of amine solvents were used in every 10 minutes of experiment.

Most of the captured CO2 will be used for enhanced oil recovery at the nearby Elk Hills Oil Field, enabling the production of millions of additional barrels of domestic oil, a 10-20% increase in the amount of oil recovered. Some of the CO2 will be used in the manufacturing of fertilizer. The project will use brackish groundwater for its process water needs and will have a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system in order to protect and conserve local freshwater sources.|$|R

Most are, therefore, equipped with a modern incinerator. Moreover, flue gases must be effectively cleaned to meet hygienical standards. This works is devoted to the investigation of some parameters characterizing the cleaning section of the Pardubice hospital incinerator. Because the measurement of concentration of some gaseous components in flue gases represents a legal duty of a company, optimization of the <b>acid</b> <b>gases</b> <b>removal</b> (HCl, CL 2) and determination of composition of the dust particles was the aim of this first step of the work...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNatural gas always {{contains}} contaminants such as <b>acid</b> <b>gases</b> (CO 2 and H 2 S), mercaptans {{and other}} sulfur components. With {{the purpose of}} avoiding corrosion when water is present, safety problems and environmental issues, these impurities must be removed until an acceptable specification. According to Huguet et al. [1], the treated gas contains as maximum as 2 % CO 2, 2 – 4 ppm H 2 S and 5 – 30 ppm total sulfur (mercaptans and COS). Absorption with alkanolamines processes are commonly used for natural gas treatment. The knowledge of the mercaptans solubility in aqueous alkanolamine solutions is important in <b>acid</b> <b>gas</b> <b>removal</b> process simulation and design, as it allows designers to confirm their regulatory limits. In previous works done at CTP, the activity coefficients at infinite dilution and Henry's law constant of mercaptans [2] have been determined by using gas stripping method; the solubilities of n-Propyl-mercaptan, n-Butyl-mercaptan and Dimethylsulfide in loaded, and unloaded MDEA and DEA aqueous solutions [3] were measured by using static analytic method. In this work, we report the results of Vapor Liquid Equilibrium measurements of different mercaptans (methyl-and ethyl-mercaptan) in different alkanolamine solutions of MDEA. Thermodynamic models are crucial for <b>acid</b> <b>gas</b> <b>removal</b> process simulation and design. The association effects of water and alkanolamine have the most important role in these systems. Hence, Cubic-Plus-Association Equation of State [4] (CPA EoS) has been chosen. In previous work [5], CPA EoS was successfully applied to describe the phase equilibria of alkane-alkanolamine-water ternary systems. In the present work, CPA EoS was applied to represent mercaptans solubility in aqueous alkanolamine solutions. Satisfactory results are obtained for representing both liquid and vapor phase composition...|$|R

Significant CO 2 removal (up to 75 %) was achieved even {{with the use of}} pure water as absorbent. By using aqueous amine solutions and chemical absorption, mass transfer improved, and CO 2 removal was nearly complete (, 99 %). A mathematical model was developed to simulate the process and it was validated with experimental data. Results show that membrane contactors are significantly more efficient and compact than conventional absorption towers for <b>acid</b> <b>gas</b> <b>removal...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a summary of}} a desktop review, using the Six Sigma methodology, of root causes for {{corrosion}} incidents in Hot Potassium Carbonate <b>acid</b> <b>gas</b> <b>removal</b> plant. These corrosion incidents involve rapid localised corrosion of carbon steel vessel walls by the CO 2 containing process solution. The possible root causes are identified as (1) inadequate concentration of anodic inhibitor, (2) the presence of hydrocarbons, (3) process conditions of high gas loading and/or frothing/ foaming, (4) formation of a sulfide layer and (5) galvanic interaction. An overview of the Six Sigma methodology is included. A methodology such as Six Sigma {{can be used to}} assist in overcoming the corrosion problem. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
25|$|All coal gasification-based {{conversion}} processes require {{removal of}} hydrogen sulfide (H2S; an <b>acid</b> <b>gas)</b> from the syngas {{as part of}} the overall plant configuration. Typical <b>acid</b> <b>gas</b> <b>removal</b> (AGR) processes employed for gasification design are either a chemical solvent system (e.g., amine gas treating systems based on MDEA, for example) or a physical solvent system (e.g., Rectisol or Selexol). Process selection is mostly dependent on the syngas cleanup requirement and costs. Conventional chemical/physical AGR processes using MDEA, Rectisol or Selexol are commercially proven technologies and can be designed for selective removal of CO2 in addition to H2S from a syngas stream. For significant capture of CO2 from a gasification plant (e.g., > 80%) the CO in the syngas must first be converted to CO2 and hydrogen (H2) via a water-gas-shift (WGS) step upstream of the AGR plant.|$|R
