5|$|Upon taking {{leadership}} of the AFL, Meany put forward a proposal to merge with the CIO.

5|$|Believing that {{by taking}} {{in one of}} the Cortexiphan {{subjects}} they can stop the effects of another quake, <b>a</b> <b>willing</b> Lane from the parallel universe travels to the prime and is hooked to Walter's (John Noble) equipment. Olivia also hooks herself up, allowing her to communicate what she sees in Lane's mind. When the prime version of Lane attempts to get into the right position, Olivia is able to identify his location, and he is captured in time. However, despite disrupting the process for Lane, earthquakes continue across the world. Walter estimates that the next set of quakes will cause both universes to collapse.|$|E

He then asks Ariel to bring some other spirits and create a masque to entertain the young couple. These spirits present a blessing by Iris, Ceres, and Juno, followed by dancing. Prospero suddenly remembers the plot against his life, dismisses the spirits and Miranda and Ferdinand, and sets a trap for Caliban, Trinculo, and Stephano. They are chased offstage by goblins {{in the shape of}} hounds.|$|E
5|$|The 1961 {{season was}} typical on the field: Jim Brown {{led the league}} in rushing for the fifth {{straight}} season and the team ended with an 8–5–1 record. That left Cleveland two games out of a berth in the championship. During that year, however, players began to question Paul Brown's strict and often overbearing demeanor, while many challenged his control over the team's strategy. Milt Plum spoke out against Brown calling all the team's offensive plays, and Jim Brown said on a weekly radio broadcast that the coach's play-calling and handling of Plum were undermining the quarterback's confidence. They found <b>a</b> <b>willing</b> listener in Modell, a bachelor who was closer to their age than the coach's.|$|E
5|$|The group {{increasingly}} {{focused on}} the suppression of sexual desire; Applewhite and seven others opted for surgical castration. They initially had difficulty finding <b>a</b> <b>willing</b> surgeon, but eventually found one in Mexico. In Applewhite's view, sexuality {{was one of the}} most powerful forces that bound humans to their bodies and thus hindered their efforts to evolve to the Next Level; he taught that Next Level beings had no reproductive organs but that Luciferian beings had genders. He also cited a verse in the New Testament that said there would not be marriage in heaven. In addition, he required members to adopt similar clothing and haircuts, possibly to reinforce that they were a non-sexual family.|$|E

5|$|Black {{attempts}} to locate further {{information about the}} Millennium Group's activity, having believed them defeated in 1999. He finds that his access to their old computer systems still works, and learns that they may know the whereabouts of his daughter Jordan. Spurred on by several momentary encounters with similarly demonic beings, Black returns to his home town of Seattle, Washington. As he visits the grave of his wife Catherine, he is tranquilised and apprehended by Group members. Waking in captivity, he learns that they seek his help against the same demonic forces he has been encountering—and that Jordan is now <b>a</b> <b>willing</b> initiate of the Group. She has now begun to powerfully manifest visions of the future, similar to Black's ability to see the past through others' eyes.|$|E
5|$|News of the war's end {{was brought}} by Pereira Pinto {{and met with}} joy in Rio de Janeiro. Brazilian Emperor Dom PedroII found himself waylaid by a crowd of {{thousands}} in the streets amid acclamations. But public opinion quickly changed for the worse, when newspapers began running stories painting the accord of 20 February as harmful to Brazilian interests, for which the cabinet was blamed. The newly raised Viscount of Tamandaré and Mena Barreto (now Baron of São Gabriel) had supported the peace accord. Tamandaré changed his mind soon afterward and played along with the allegations. Paranhos (a member of the opposition party) {{was used as a}} scapegoat by the Emperor and the government, and was recalled in disgrace to the imperial capital. Subsequent events show the accusation was unfounded. Not only had Paranhos managed to settle all Brazilian claims, but by avoiding the death of thousands, he gained <b>a</b> <b>willing</b> and grateful Uruguayan ally, not a dubious and resentful one — who provided Brazil an important base of operations during the war with Paraguay that followed.|$|E
5|$|On June 30, 2004, then-Mayor Newsom {{pledged to}} fix San Francisco’s {{homeless}} problem within 10 years and clear downtown streets of its widespread homeless population. He stated {{that people who}} were homeless and seriously ill would be given shelter. After 10 years and $1.5 billion, the city relocated 19,500 people off the streets, with 11,363 single adults being housed, and 8,086 people {{being sent to the}} home of <b>a</b> <b>willing</b> family member or friend though the Homeward Bound program. Before the program in 2002, there was a 8,640 generally homeless and 4,535 street homeless population in San Francisco. After the program was initiated, the homeless population dropped 28% by 2005, with a generally homeless population of 6,248 and a 2,655 street homeless population. However, after 2005, the homeless population has stayed approximately the same. In fact, the San Francisco population of homeless rose 3 percent between 2005 and 2013. The percentage of the homeless population in jail was cut in half between 2005 and 2013, which is an indicator that some of the homeless population who would have ended up in jail were now being housed and treated.|$|E
5|$|For Kant <b>a</b> good <b>will</b> is <b>a</b> broader {{conception}} than <b>a</b> <b>will</b> {{which acts}} from duty. <b>A</b> <b>will</b> which acts from duty is distinguishable as <b>a</b> <b>will</b> which overcomes hindrances {{in order to}} keep the moral law. <b>A</b> dutiful <b>will</b> is thus <b>a</b> special case of <b>a</b> good <b>will</b> which becomes visible in adverse conditions. Kant argues that only acts performed with regard to duty have moral worth. This is not to say that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless (these still deserve approval and encouragement), but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty.|$|R

The first encounter pitted Serena D against Kong, which Kong won after slamming Serena face-first into the mat with her signature Implant Buster maneuver at 2 minutes and 26 seconds. The second was between Josie Robinson and Kong, lasting 1 minute and 42 seconds. Kong won the bout after slamming Josie back-first into the mat with her signature Awesome Bomb maneuver.|$|E

But by the Larceny Act 1861 stealing, {{injuring}} or concealing <b>a</b> <b>will,</b> whether of real or personal estate, was punishable with penal servitude for life. Forgery of <b>a</b> <b>will</b> (at one time a capital crime) rendered the offender liable to the same penalty.

5000|$|Contesting <b>a</b> <b>will</b> can be expensive. According to a Boston-area estate {{planning}} attorney quoted in Consumer Reports (March, 2012), [...] "A typical will contest will cost $10,000 to $50,000, and that's a conservative estimate". Costs can increase even more if <b>a</b> <b>will</b> contest actually goes to trial, {{and the overall}} value of an estate can determine if <b>a</b> <b>will</b> contest is worth the expense. In some cases, the threat of <b>a</b> <b>will</b> contest is intended to both pressure the estate into avoiding {{the expense of a}} trial and forcing an out-of-court settlement more favorable to disgruntled heirs. However, those who make frivolous or groundless objections to <b>a</b> <b>will</b> may be forced to pay the costs for both sides in the court battle.|$|R

25|$|France's {{intervention}} in Canadian intergovernmental relations remained {{largely in the}} realm of diplomatic rhetoric. Indeed, as Quebec, under the reformist Liberal government of Jean Lesage, was turning away from a more isolationist past and attempting to find for itself a new place within the Canadian federation and the wider francophone world, <b>a</b> <b>willing</b> and enthusiastic de Gaulle was eager to give aid to Quebec's newfound nationalist ambitions.|$|E
