5|$|The final victim, {{killed on}} 31 October 1828, was Margaret Docherty, a middle-aged Irish woman. Burke lured {{her into the}} Broggan lodging house by {{claiming}} {{that his mother was}} also a Docherty from the same area of Ireland, and the pair began drinking. At one point Burke left Docherty in the company of Helen McDougal while he went out, ostensibly to buy more whisky, but <b>actually</b> <b>to</b> get Hare. Two other lodgers—Ann and James Gray—were an inconvenience to the men, so they paid them to stay at Hare's lodging for the night, claiming Docherty was a relative. The drinking continued into the evening, by which time Margaret Hare had joined in. At around 9:00pm the Grays returned briefly to collect some clothing for their children, and saw Burke, Hare, their wives and Docherty all drunk, singing and dancing. Although Burke and Hare came to blows {{at some point in the}} evening, they subsequently murdered Docherty, and put her body in a pile of straw at the end of the bed.|$|E
5|$|The ships saw {{no action}} during the war, owing {{in large part}} to the nature of the Adriatic campaign. The Austro-Hungarian Navy and its primary opponent, the Italian Navy, both adopted {{cautious}} strategies, since neither wanted to risk its fleet in the narrow waters of the Adriatic Sea, where naval mines and fast, torpedo-armed craft could operate effectively. Zara was stationed in Cattaro Bay and Sebenico protected the harbor of her namesake city, while Spalato provided local defense outside Pola. Zara was transferred from Cattaro Bay to Pola in June 1917, but while en route, suffered a serious explosion that caused significant damage to her bow. A contemporary investigation determined that it was the result of badly deteriorated chemicals in her torpedo warheads, though the naval historian René Greger reports that a mine was <b>actually</b> <b>to</b> blame. After repairs were effected, she joined the harbor defense at Pola. Sebenico was withdrawn from guard duties in 1918 and assigned to the torpedo school. All three ships were seized as war prizes by the victorious Allied powers after the war in 1918, and all three were awarded to Italy in 1920. Having no use for the vessels, the Italians immediately sold all three to ship breakers.|$|E

25|$|There is {{speculation}} by {{some historians}} that Suleiman's main objective in 1529 was <b>actually</b> <b>to</b> assert Ottoman {{control over the}} whole of Hungary, {{the western part of}} which (known as Royal Hungary) was under Habsburg control. The decision to attack Vienna after such a long interval in Suleiman's European campaign is viewed as an opportunistic manoeuvre after his decisive victory in Hungary.

25|$|Workers of the {{tropical}} leafcutter ant bringing leaf fragments back to the nest {{are at risk of}} attack by parasitodic phorid flies, who often land on leaf fragments and then proceed to oviposit (egg-lay) into the ant's head. To help combat this, small workers (minims) in at least seven species of Atta hitchhike on the leaves, deterring parasitioid attack. Many possible additional functions of hitchhiking have been proposed, some pertinent to social immunity; evidence exists that the primary function of hitchhiking minims' is <b>actually</b> <b>to</b> inspect and clean the leaf fragments prior to their entry into the colony, removing microbial parasites and contaminants.|$|E
25|$|But if he {{was eager}} in his own defence he was no less so in that of others. In 1721 a drunken nobleman reeled on to {{the stage of the}} theatre and {{assaulted}} the manager, Rich, whose life was saved by Quin's prompt armed interference. This resulted in a riot, and thereafter a guard was stationed in all theatres. In 1732 Quin appeared at Covent Garden, returning to Drury Lane from 1734 to 1741, and in 1742 was again at Covent Garden, where he remained until the close of his career. On 14 November 1746 Quin played Horatio and Garrick Lothario to the Calista of Mrs Cibber in Rose's Fair Penitent. The applause of the audience was so great as to disconcert if not <b>actually</b> <b>to</b> alarm the two actors.|$|E

25|$|The Sugar Act of 1764 was {{the first}} tax in Grenville's program to raise a revenue in America, which was a {{modification}} of the Molasses Act of 1733. The Molasses Act had imposed a tax of 6 pence per gallon (equal to £ today) on foreign molasses imported into British colonies. The purpose of the Molasses Act was not <b>actually</b> <b>to</b> raise revenue, but instead to make foreign molasses so expensive that it effectively gave a monopoly to molasses imported from the British West Indies. It did not work; colonial merchants avoided the tax by smuggling or, more often, bribing customs officials. The Sugar Act reduced the tax to 3 pence per gallon (equal to £ today) {{in the hope that}} the lower rate would increase compliance and thus increase the amount of tax collected. The Act also taxed additional imports and included measures to make the customs service more effective.|$|E

They also failed to dismiss England for under 350 runs in a series completely dominated by England.|$|E
