50|$|Apart from testing hearing, {{part of the}} {{function}} of audiometry is in assessing or evaluating hearing from the test results. The most commonly used assessment of hearing is {{the determination of the}} threshold of audibility, i.e. the level of sound required to be just audible. This level can varyfor an individual over a range of up to 5 Decibels from day to day and from determination to determination, but it provides an additional and useful tool in monitoring the potential ill effects of exposure to noise. Before carrying out a hearing test, it is important to obtain information about the person’s past medical history, not only concerning the ears but also other conditions which may have a bearing on possible hearing loss detected by an <b>audiometric</b> <b>test.</b> Hearing loss may be unilateral or bilateral, and bilateral hearing loss may not be symmetrical. The most common types of hearing loss, due to age and noise exposure, are usually bilateral and symmetrical. Wax in the ear can also cause hearing loss, so the ear should be examined to see if syringing is needed; also to determine if the eardrum has suffered any damage which may reduce the ability of sound to be transmitted to the middle ear.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Hearing loss affects 31 million Americans, particu-larly {{veterans}} who {{were exposed to}} harmful levels of noise dur-ing military functions. Many veterans also receive treatment with ototoxic medications, which may exacerbate preexisting hearing loss. Thus, hearing loss is the most common and tinnitus the third most common service-connected disability among veterans. Poor implementation of hearing protection programs and a lack of <b>audiometric</b> <b>testing</b> during medical treatment leave veterans vul-nerable to unrecognized and untreated hearing loss until speech communication is impaired. Individualized <b>audiometric</b> <b>testing</b> techniques, including assessment of high frequencies, can be used in clinical and occupational settings to detect early hearing loss.

40|$|Introduction Noise-induced {{hearing loss}} (NIHL) {{is a serious}} problem for workers and {{therefore}} for businesses. The hearing conservation program (HCP) is a set of coordinated measures to prevent the development or evolution of occupational hearing loss, which involves a continuous and dynamic process of implementation of hearing conservation routines through anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and subsequent control of the occurrence of existing environmental risks or of those thatmay exist in the workplace and lead to workers hearing damage. Objective The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of the HCP in preventing further hearing loss in workers with audiograms suggestive of NIHL. The <b>audiometric</b> <b>tests</b> and medical records of 28 furniture company workers exposed to noise were reviewed and monitored for 2 years. Methods This retrospective, cross-sectional study examined five <b>audiometric</b> <b>tests</b> in the medical records (on admission and every semester) of 28 workers in a furniture company (totaling 140 audiometric exams) following the introduction of the HCP.

Conclusions The HCP implemented was effective in preventing the worsening of hearing loss in workers already with NIHL when exposed to occupational noise.

40|$|Objective: Occupational noise {{exposure}} and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) among construction workers {{has long been}} recognized as {{a problem in the}} United States, yet {{little is known about the}} prevalence of NIHL among American construction workers. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of hearing loss among operating engineers (OEs) who operate heavy construction machinery. Method: As a part of hearing protection intervention, an <b>audiometric</b> <b>test</b> was conducted for both ears at frequencies 0. 5 through 8  kHz in the soundproof booth. Prior to the <b>audiometric</b> <b>test,</b> a paper-pencil pre-hearing test questionnaire was administered and an otoscopic examination was completed. Prevalence of hearing loss was determined based on hearing threshold levels (HTLs) in the worst ear with a low fence of 25  dB. Result: A total of 623 workers were included in the analysis and they were predominantly middle-aged Caucasian males (mean age = 43  years, Caucasian = 90 %, male = 92 %). Over 60 % of OEs showed hearing loss in the noise-sensitive higher frequencies of 4 and 6  kHz. The rate of hearing loss was particularly higher among workers who reported longer years of working in the construction industry. Workers showed significantly poorer hearing in the left ear, and a typical characteristic of NIHL, a V-notch at 4 or 6  kHz, was not shown in this population. Thirty-eight percent reported ringing/buzzing in the ear and 62 % indicated having problems in understanding what people say in loud noise. Average reported use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) was 48 % of the time they were required to be used. Significant inverse relationship was found between higher frequency (4 – 6  kHz) hearing loss and use of HPDs (r =− 0. 134, p < 0. 001). Workers using HPDs more had significantly better hearing than those who did not. Conclusion: The study demonstrated a significant NIHL problem and low use of HPDs in OEs.

Patients with unilateral total deafness underwent preoperative <b>audiometric</b> <b>tests</b> in quiet and in noise and stereoaudiometry with and without BAHA. Patients with a conductive hearing loss underwent preoperative <b>audiometric</b> <b>tests</b> in quiet and in noise and real-life testing at home using a headband. A standardized satisfaction questionnaire derived from the Entific BAHA questionnaire was used. ResultsTwenty-two out of 26 patients responded to the questionnaire. Ten patients were implanted for conductive hearing loss (CHL) and 12 for unilateral total deafness (UTD). Mean follow-up was 19 months in the UTD group and 21 months in the CHL group. Sixty-seven percent of UTD and 80 % of CHL patients reported improved quality of life.
