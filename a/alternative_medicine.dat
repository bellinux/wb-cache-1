5|$|Over 50% of MS {{patients}} may use complementary and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine,</b> although numbers vary greatly {{depending on the}} definition of <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> used. In the United States, {{it is estimated that}} 75% of the MS patient populations use at least one complementary and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> for treatment and symptomatic control. The evidence for effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Examples of treatments used by patients include dietary supplementation and regimens such as vitamin D, calcium, vitamin B12, and antioxidants. The rationale behind the use of Vitamin D supplementation is that studies show an association between vitamin D deficiency and increasing progression of MS, as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{complementary}} and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicines</b> {{is increasing}} among chronic patients, particularly those afflicted with inflammatory bowel diseases. AIM: This study aimed {{to address the}} prevalence of complementary and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicines</b> use among Portuguese inflammatory bowel diseases' patients. METHODS: Patients were invited to fill an anonymous questionnaire concerning the use of complementary and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicines.</b> RESULTS: Thirty-one per cent of the patients reported having used complementary and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicines</b> in the past, whereas 12 % were using them {{by the time the}} questionnaire was administered. Fifty-nine per cent of the users did not share this information with their physician, whereas 14 % and 8 % discontinued their medication and periodical examination, respectively. Steroids prescription (OR= 2. 880) and a higher instruction level (OR= 3. 669) were predictors of complementary and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicines</b> use in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Roughly a third of Portuguese IBD patients had used CAM. Steroid treatment and an academic degree are associated with CAM use. Given the potential side effects and interactions, patient information about the benefits and limitations of conventional and complementary treatments should be reinforced. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of <b>alternative</b> <b>medicines</b> for AIDS in Asia and Africa was discussed at a satellite symposium and the parallel session on alternative and traditional treatments of the AIDS Impact meeting, held in Marseille, in July 2007. These medicines are heterogeneous, {{both in their}} presentation and in their geographic and cultural origin. The sessions focused {{on the role of}} these medications in selected resource poor settings in Africa and Asia now that access to anti-retroviral therapy is increasing. The aims of the sessions were to (1) identify the actors involved in the diffusion of these <b>alternative</b> <b>medicines</b> for HIV/AIDS, (2) explore uses and forms, and the way these medicines are given legitimacy, (3) reflect on underlying processes of globalisation and cultural differentiation, and (4) define priority questions for future research in this area. This article presents the insights generated at the meeting, illustrated with some findings from the case studies (Uganda, Senegal, Benin, Burkina Faso, China and Indonesia) that were presented. These case studies reveal the wide range of actors who are involved in the marketing and supply of <b>alternative</b> <b>medicines.</b> Regulatory mechanisms are weak. The efficacy claims of <b>alternative</b> <b>medicines</b> often reinforce a biomedical paradigm for HIV/AIDS, and fit with a healthy living ideology promoted by AIDS care programs and support groups. The AIDSImpact session concluded that more interdisciplinary research is needed on the experience of people living with HIV/AIDS with these <b>alternative</b> <b>medicines,</b> and on the ways in which these products interact (or not) with anti-retroviral therapy at pharmacological as well as psychosocial levels...|$|R

40|$|Altered motility, {{discomfort}} and pain are common debilitating symptoms {{of patients with}} functional gastrointestinal disorders. However, these conditions represent a significant and unmet need for mainstream medical treatment, particularly after high profile therapeutic drug withdrawals due to safety concerns. As such {{an increasing number of}} sufferers are turning to <b>alternative</b> <b>medicines</b> in an effort to seek relief from their symptoms. <b>Alternative</b> <b>medicines</b> have traditionally been looked at by mainstream medicine with cynicism. However, new evidence demonstrates that the active components in natural products have actions on specific ion channels and receptors, many of which are located in sensory systems distributed throughout the body. These findings may not only explain the symptomatic benefit of these <b>alternative</b> <b>medicines</b> but also provide novel therapeutic targets for mainstream drug development. As such natural products represent a wealth of untapped potential which is waiting to be unlocked. Stuart M Brierley and Olaf Kelber[URL]...|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the poor}} quality of most studies of {{complementary}} and <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> {{in the treatment of}} cancer pain, {{it is not possible to}} recommend integration of these therapies into the management of cancer pain. There is weak evidence for a modest benefit from hypnosis; studies of massage therapy produced mixed results and none found pain relief after 4 weeks; Reiki, and touch therapy results were inconclusive; acupuncture, the most studied such treatment, has demonstrated no benefit as an adjunct analgesic in cancer pain; the evidence for music therapy is equivocal; and some herbal interventions such as PC-SPES, mistletoe, and saw palmetto are known to be toxic to some people with cancer. The most promising evidence, though still weak, is for mind-body interventions such as biofeedback and relaxation techniques.|$|E

5|$|Paradoxically, {{since the}} first decade of the 21st century, New World Order conspiracism is {{increasingly}} being embraced and propagandized by New Age occultists, who are people bored by rationalism and drawn to stigmatized knowledge—such as <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine,</b> astrology, quantum mysticism, spiritualism, and theosophy. Thus, New Age conspiracy theorists, such as the makers of documentary films like Esoteric Agenda, claim that globalists who plot on behalf of the New World Order are simply misusing occultism for Machiavellian ends, such as adopting 21 December 2012 as the exact date for the establishment of the New World Order for the purpose of taking advantage of the growing 2012 phenomenon, which has its origins in the fringe Mayanist theories of New Age writers José Argüelles, Terence McKenna, and Daniel Pinchbeck.|$|E

Wilder uses <b>alternative</b> <b>medicine</b> to help King deal with her pain. Psychiatrist Violet Turner (Amy Brenneman) refuses to talk to King about the rape because of similarities to the fetal abduction she experienced a year earlier, and wonders if everyone in the practice is cursed. Bennett wants to go home and rest, which angers Montgomery. King attempts to compose a memorandum saying that she was attacked on the hospital grounds, but Freedman suggests that another member of the staff do it for her; she shouts at Freedman when he calls her a victim. After the argument, Freedman goes to King's office and weeps when he sees the aftermath of her assault. McHenry admits raping a woman, assaulting Wallace before he is pulled away by the police. In the ambulance bay, Bennett expresses his confusion about Montgomery's mood swings and suspects that she is hiding something from him; Montgomery asks him to promise never to leave her alone. After Freedman helps her dress, King says that she loves him and wants to go home. McHenry is held by the police for assaulting a police officer during his arrest and Wallace during his interrogation, but detective Joe Price says that McHenry cannot be charged with rape until charges are filed against him. The episode ends with King walking out of the hospital with Freedman's help; flashbacks of the rape reveal that McHenry was the rapist.|$|E
