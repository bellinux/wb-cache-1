5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} the Dutch East Indies in 1942, Soeman {{was made a}} school supervisor by occupying forces. He soon became involved in politics, being elected to the Shūsangikai, a Japanese-sponsored regional representatives' council, for Riau. He later recalled that, {{because he had been}} elected rather than selected by the Japanese forces—and thus had strong backing among the community, which could be used for revolution—he had felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> under constant surveillance. This situation continued until after the Japanese withdrew from Indonesia and Sukarno proclaimed an independent Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Upon Philip's return, he {{dispatched}} Alexander {{with a small}} {{force to}} subdue revolts in southern Thrace. Campaigning against the Greek city of Perinthus, Alexander {{is reported to have}} saved his father's life. Meanwhile, the city of Amphissa began to work lands that were sacred to Apollo near Delphi, a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. Still occupied in Thrace, he ordered Alexander to muster an army for a campaign in southern Greece. Concerned that other Greek states might intervene, Alexander made it look <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> preparing to attack Illyria instead. During this turmoil, the Illyrians invaded Macedonia, only to be repelled by Alexander.|$|E

25|$|Churchill was displeased {{with the}} results of Operation Battleaxe. He had been expecting nothing less than {{complete}} success and had instead received news that the operation had failed and the tanks sent for it had been lost. Churchill sacked Wavell but could not have it look <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being punished or have Wavell return to England, as embarrassing questions could be raised. Churchill had Wavell exchange duties with General Claude Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief, India. Along with Wavell went Michael O'Moore Creagh, who was replaced by Gott.|$|E
25|$|Wittgenstein's {{influence}} has been felt {{in nearly every}} field of the humanities and social sciences, yet there are diverging interpretations of his thought. In the words of his friend and colleague Georg Henrik von Wright: He was of the opinion... that his ideas were generally misunderstood and distorted even by those who professed to be his disciples. He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said he felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{everybody}} pays him homage. I nearly blow my top. I {{can still}} hear {{the way he was}} whistled when he rode. I think of the organisers of the Tour, who shortened the time trial to make him lose. His home town of Rouen organises commemorations but, me, I haven't forgotten that it was in Antwerp that he made his farewell appearance. More than once, I saw him crying in his hotel room after suffering the spitting and insults of spectators. People said he was cold, a calculator, a dilettante. The truth is that Jacques was a monster of courage. In the mountains, he suffered <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> damned. He wasn't a climber. But with bluffing, with guts, he tore them to shreds (il les a tous couillonnés).|$|E

25|$|Richie {{is able to}} {{secretly}} abstract JR's bone marrow, while setting JR up to look <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> out {{all night}} with a hooker the day he went missing. A drugged-up JR, unaware that his bone marrow has been stolen, insists {{to his family and}} Babe that he was drugged and he knows Richie did this to him. Initially Krystal is the only one to believe JR, but Babe later finds out that JR is telling the truth about Richie and apologizes to him. She sees Richie pay the hooker that was with JR the night Richie stole his bone marrow. Babe punches out the hooker. She goes on a mission to find out what other stuff Richie has done to JR or anyone else. During this mission, JR saves Babe from being raped by some guys when she goes undercover as a prostitute to clear JR's name and find out what crimes Richie did. Trina decides to tell the truth about Richie and her part in framing JR when Richie stole his bone marrow. JR promises Trina some money to get out of prostituting and go somewhere Richie is not due to fear that Richie will kill her since she told JR what Richie did. With Richie finally gone, JR and Babe come happily together again.|$|E

He got to the podium—and I sat up straight. I was impressed with him.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the album}} was {{generally}} well received, its content drew criticism from fans, who felt the overall effect diminished the significance of Harrison's solo career. In the 1977 edition of their book , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler summed up the implication: [...] "George's 'Best Of'. Half Beatle, half Harisongs. But {{will there be a}} Volume II?" [...] Nicholas Schaffner observed a couple of minor positives on this [...] "half-baked" [...] collection: [...] "The Best of George Harrison does confirm that George's big production numbers from All Things Must Pass more than hold their own alongside the seven featured Beatles tunes... And the album is undeniably better looking than Rock 'n' Roll Music." [...] Bob Woffinden similarly found that Harrison's solo recordings matched the standard of the Beatles' tracks while noting that [...] "Capitol's half-and-half arrangement... made it look <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{the only one of the}} four [...] with insufficient clout to warrant a 'Greatest Hits' [...] entirely of his own work." ...|$|E

500|$|Stylistically, One Hot Minute diverged {{from the}} Chili Peppers' {{previous}} records—especially Blood Sugar Sex Magik. The album {{was characterized by}} prominent use of heavy metal guitar riffs and hints of psychedelic rock. Navarro, unlike Flea and Kiedis, was not influenced by funk music. He told Guitar World in 1996, [...] "It doesn't really speak to me. But then again, when I'm playing with three other guys who I love and feel camaraderie with, it's enjoyable to play funk." [...] Navarro's own style was influenced mainly by classic rock guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page, as well as gothic rock guitarists Robert Smith and Daniel Ash. Continuing a trend that started on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Kiedis diverged even further away from his signature rapping, only doing so on a few tracks. One Hot Minute took almost two years to write, and its recording and production was not a smooth process. Navarro felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> an outsider to the other members. His writing in Jane's Addiction was independent from other contributors, whereas the Red Hot Chili Peppers was a far more collaborative group. Navarro himself noted that the band's dynamic was more balanced than that of Jane's Addiction, which was often dominated by frontman Perry Farrell.|$|E
500|$|... "Never Had a Dream Come True" [...] {{had marked}} a more mature {{direction}} for the group whilst still retaining their pop sensibilities, a direction which continued into their third studio album, Sunshine. The album contained {{what was to become}} one of S Club's most popular tracks, [...] "Don't Stop Movin'". The song was released in April 2001, marked a high point for the group as the single went straight to number-one, went Platinum and became the seventh best selling single of 2001. McIntosh, who takes lead vocals with O'Meara in the track, said he was [...] "nervous" [...] about taking lead vocals and was worried how people would react. However, after the song went in at number-one, he felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> [...] "supported by the fans" [...] and his fears were alleviated. McIntosh also remarked that the single had broken new ground for the group, and Cattermole thought it to be their [...] "best song by miles". The group won the Record of the Year award for the song, and in February 2002, the single won the group their second BRIT Award for best British single. The song has since been covered by The Beautiful South for their 2004 album Golddiggas, Headnodders and Pholk Songs, as well as by Starsailor who recorded it for BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge.|$|E
500|$|The {{shooting}} of El-Sherbini's husband Okaz {{by the federal}} police officer, who mistook him for the attacker, was cited by El-Sherbini's brother as indicative of racism in Germany. Following a complaint, a criminal investigation was launched against the police officer who shot Okaz. In October 2009, a criminal investigation for involuntary manslaughter and denial of assistance was launched against the judge {{who presided over the}} July trial, and against the president of the regional court. On 29 December 2009, the public prosecutor's office in Dresden announced that all investigations had been closed on 21 December 2009 without indictment, as no suspicion of a criminal offence could be substantiated. Prosecutors argued that it must have been particularly difficult to assess the situation for the intervening police officer, because when he entered the room [...] "Elwy Okaz and Alex Wiens were both covered in blood and Elwy Okaz had just managed to grab the handle of the knife with his hand, making it appear <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the attacker". There were further assessment difficulties because [...] "the actual attacker—Wiens—was holding the blade of the knife, which added to the impression that he was the one being attacked". The prosecutors' conclusion was that {{shooting of}} Okaz was a tragic mistake. In January 2010, a lawyer acting for El-Sherbini's family filed a complaint against the prosecutors' decisions to close the investigations against the police officer, the judge presiding in the 1 July 2009 trial and the regional court president.|$|E

500|$|That {{indemnification}} was {{an important}} sideshow in the negotiations. The consequence of the Peace Treaty was that the Batavian Republic now received international recognition, even by the British government, and that the old Dutch Republic was now irreversibly dead. This {{put an end to}} all pretensions of the Stadtholder and his heirs, such as they were. It may be important to note that these pretensions were dubious to begin with. The Stadtholder was never the sovereign power in the Netherlands, despite understandable misconceptions by foreigners, who may have thought that a country needed a head of state, and the Stadtholder was it. Instead he was an officeholder, appointed by the provincial States, who also was captain-general and admiral-general of the Union (there was originally no stadtholder on the confederal level). In the Orangist revolution of 1747 this office had been revamped to [...] "Stadhouder-generaal" [...] and made hereditary, and after the Prussian intervention of 1787 the powers of the Stadtholder had become dictatorial. But formally the States-General had been sovereign since 1588, and the Stadtholder was merely their [...] "first servant." [...] The British may have entertained certain fantasies about his formal status, when it suited their purposes. An example would be the Kew Letters he was persuaded to write to the governors of the Dutch colonies in his capacity of captain-general on 7 February 1795, ordering them to immediately surrender those colonies to the British [...] "for preservation." [...] Another example would be their acceptance of the surrender of the Batavian fleet {{in the name of the}} Stadtholder in 1799, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a sovereign prince. But this was all make-believe, and it ended with this Peace (though it was conveniently revived in 1813).|$|E

2500|$|Of {{his later}} career, Arthur Mercante said: [...] "Ali {{knew all the}} tricks. He was the best fighter I ever saw in terms of clinching.

Since moving to CBS from NBC, Letterman taped his show in the Ed Sullivan Theater, the studio where Sullivan also staged his program, until his 2015 retirement.|$|E
