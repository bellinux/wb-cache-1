In particular, an IoT system in which MTDs can transmit both delay tolerant, periodic <b>messages</b> and critical <b>alarm</b> <b>messages</b> is studied. For this model, the characterization of the exponentially growing delay for critical <b>alarm</b> <b>messages</b> and the convergence of the proposed learning framework in an IoT are analyzed.

In CONFIDANT protocol, first-hand information is propagated after every 3 s, while weight given to the second-hand information is 20 %. To avoid false praise attack [11], only negative experiences as second-hand information are shared among nodes. One of the shortcomings in CONFIDANT protocol is that <b>ALARM</b> <b>messages</b> used in the protocol can be exploited by the bad-mouthing nodes. Bad-mouthing nodes may generate <b>ALARM</b> <b>messages</b> against the legitimate nodes to induce biasness in the protocol’s results [22]. Similarly, a collaborative reputation mechanism to enforce node cooperation in MANETs called CORE [9] also uses the second-hand information to compute the reputation of a node.

Because the elderly spend a lot of their time at home, the proposed line-laser obstacle detection system is designed mainly for indoor applications. Our obstacle detection system casts a laser line, which passes through a horizontal plane and has a specific height to the ground. A camera, whose optical axis has a specific inclined angle to the plane, will observe the laser pattern to obtain the potential obstacles. Based on this configuration, the distance between the obstacles and the system can be further determined by a perspective transformation called homography.

In the worst case, the overall latency of <b>alarm</b> <b>message</b> propagation is two times the slot duration, 2 Tslot[*]=[*] 6.5 s. If the first alarm transmission fails due to collision, the ED waits for a random period (equal to a number of mini-slots) before retransmission.

40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on {{critical}} event monitoring in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), where {{only a small number}} of packets need to be transmitted most of the time. When a critical event occurs, an <b>alarm</b> <b>message</b> should be broadcast to the entire network as soon as possible. To prolong the network lifetime, some sleep scheduling methods are always employed in WSNs, resulting in significant broadcasting delay, especially in large scale WSNs. In this paper, we propose a novel sleep scheduling method to reduce the delay of alarm broadcasting from any sensor node in WSNs. Specifically, we design two determined traffic paths for the transmission of <b>alarm</b> <b>message,</b> and level-by-level offset based wake-up pattern according to the paths, respectively. When a critical event occurs, an alarm is quickly transmitted along one of the traffic paths to a center node, and then it is immediately broadcast by the center node along another path without collision. Therefore, two of the big contributions are that the broadcasting delay is independent of the density of nodes and its energy consumption is ultra low. Exactly, the upper bound of the broadcasting delay is only 3 D+ 2 L, where D is the maximum hop of nodes to the center node, L is the length of sleeping duty cycle, and the unit is the size of time slot. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate these notable performances of the proposed method compared with existing works. © 2006 IEEE...|$|E
