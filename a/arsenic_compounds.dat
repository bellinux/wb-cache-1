5|$|<b>Arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> such as sodium {{arsenite}} or sodium arsenate are effective flame retardants for wood {{but have been}} less frequently used due to their toxicity. Antimony trioxide is a flame retardant. Aluminium hydroxide {{has been used as}} a wood-fibre, rubber, plastic and textile flame retardant since the 1890s. Apart from aluminium hydroxide, use of phosphorus based flame-retardants—in the form of, for example, organophosphates—now exceeds that of any of the other main retardant types. These employ boron, antimony or halogenated hydrocarbon compounds.|$|E
5|$|After the impact, villagers who had {{approached}} the impact site grew sick from a then-unexplained illness, {{with a wide}} array of symptoms. Two days later, Peruvian scientists confirmed that there had indeed been a meteorite strike, quieting widespread speculation that {{it may have been a}} geophysical rather than a celestial event. At that point, no further information on the cause of the mystery illness was known. The ground water in the local area is known to contain <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds,</b> and the illness is now believed to have been caused by arsenic poisoning incurred when residents of the area inhaled the vapor of the boiling arsenic-contaminated water.|$|E
25|$|Arsenic {{biochemistry}} {{refers to}} biochemical processes that can use arsenic or its compounds, such as arsenate. Arsenic is a moderately abundant element in Earth's crust, and although many <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> are often considered highly toxic to most life, {{a wide variety}} of organoarsenic compounds are produced biologically and various organic and inorganic <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> are metabolized by numerous organisms. This pattern is general for other related elements, including selenium, which can exhibit both beneficial and deleterious effects. Arsenic biochemistry has become topical since many toxic <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> are found in some aquifers, potentially affecting many millions of people via biochemical processes.|$|E

25|$|During the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, {{a number}} of <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> were used as medicines, {{including}} arsphenamine (by Paul Ehrlich) and arsenic trioxide (by Thomas Fowler).

25|$|Inorganic <b>arsenic</b> and its <b>compounds,</b> upon {{entering}} the food chain, are progressively metabolized {{through a process of}} methylation. For example, the mold Scopulariopsis brevicaulis produces significant amounts of trimethylarsine if inorganic arsenic is present. The organic compound arsenobetaine is found in some marine foods such as fish and algae, and also in mushrooms in larger concentrations. The average person's intake is about 10–50µg/day. Values about 1000µg are not unusual following consumption of fish or mushrooms, but there is little danger in eating fish because this <b>arsenic</b> <b>compound</b> is nearly non-toxic.|$|R

25|$|One of the {{simplest}} <b>arsenic</b> <b>compound</b> is the trihydride, the highly toxic, flammable, pyrophoric arsine (AsH3).

Several factors, such as humidity, presence of light and certain catalysts (namely aluminium) facilitate the rate of decomposition. It oxidises readily in air to form arsenic trioxide and water, and analogous reactions take place with sulfur and selenium instead of oxygen.|$|R

25|$|Oxidation and {{reduction}} affects {{the migration of}} arsenic in subsurface environments. Arsenite is the most stable soluble form of arsenic in reducing environments and arsenate, which is less mobile than arsenite, is dominant in oxidizing environments at neutral pH. Therefore, arsenic may be more mobile under reducing conditions. The reducing environment is also rich in organic matter which may enhance the solubility of <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds.</b> As a result, the adsorption of arsenic is reduced and dissolved arsenic accumulates in groundwater. That is why the arsenic content is higher in reducing environments than in oxidizing environments.|$|E
25|$|Hot {{water from}} the {{treatment}} plant was circulated in small-bore pipes alongside the pipeline to reduce heat losses and potential hydrate formation, an ice-like substance that can cause blockages. At the Pickering treatment plant raw gas was routed through a slug catcher and inlet separator to remove liquid hydrocarbons and water. Gas flowed to two parallel vetrocoke absorbers where it was washed with a counter-current aqueous solution of soda ash and <b>arsenic</b> <b>compounds</b> to convert the hydrogen sulphide to elemental sulphur. Gas then flowed to a hydrocarbon recovery unit where it was chilled to remove further liquid hydrocarbons, the dry sulphur-free gas passed through a British Gas metering station to Feeder No. 6 of the National Transmission System which passes through Pickering. The sulphur-rich solution from the absorbers was routed to oxidiser regenerators where air was bubbled through the solution to remove the sulphur {{in the form of}} a froth. The froth was dried in a rotary vacuum filter and heated in an autoclave to allow removal of impurities prior to being stored in tanks at about 130°C from where it was removed by heated road tanker. The regenerated absorber solution from the oxidisers, together with recovered solution from the vacuum filters, was returned for reuse in the vetrocoke absorbers. Hydrocarbon liquids were routed to condensate stabilizers and then to storage tanks for removal by road tanker.|$|E
