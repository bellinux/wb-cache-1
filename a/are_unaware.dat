5|$|An eclipse is {{a natural}} phenomenon. However, in some ancient and modern cultures, solar eclipses were {{attributed}} to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens. A total solar eclipse can be frightening to people who <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> of its astronomical explanation, as the Sun seems to disappear {{during the day and}} the sky darkens in a matter of minutes.|$|E

5|$|While most LARPs {{maintain}} {{a clear distinction}} between the real world and the fictional setting, pervasive LARPs mingle fiction with modern reality in a fashion similar to alternate reality games. Bystanders who <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> that a game is taking place may be treated as part of the fictional setting, and in-character materials may be incorporated into the real world.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a contracting {{model in which}} the principal frames the contract when the agent <b>is</b> <b>unaware</b> of some contingencies, yet is aware that she may <b>be</b> <b>unaware.</b> We call the contract vague if the agent <b>is</b> still <b>unaware</b> of some contingencies after understanding the contract. We show that the optimal contract is vague {{if and only if}} the principal exploits the agent. Applying the model to an insurance problem, we show the insuree is free from exploitation if she slightly underestimates the unforeseen calamities. In a contracting problem, whenever the contractor <b>is</b> <b>unaware</b> of the force majeure event, she is exploited by the employer. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|A {{researcher}} {{examining the}} skeleton identifies {{it as the}} missing victim from 1933. However, {{there seems to be}} no substantial evidence proving that Tooms was the murderer. Scully relieves Mulder, who is watching Tooms' new residence; they <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> that Tooms is hiding in the trunk of Mulder's car. He manages to break into Mulder's apartment, where he injures himself and imprints Mulder's shoe print on his face. Tooms' frameup leads the police to question Mulder. Skinner then forbids Mulder from contacting Tooms.|$|E
5|$|As {{the clerics}} set up base camp, River accesses {{footage of the}} Angel from the Byzantium to verify its secure. She and the Doctor leave to study a text written about Angels, {{learning}} that even an image of an Angel can become an Angel itself. They <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> that Amy stayed to watch the footage, and when she blinks, the Angel appears to move. The Doctor helps her stop the video feed, and believes Amy is safe, but she feels something in her eye.|$|E
5|$|In 1255 Saka, Permana Dikoesoemah is the King of Galuh, {{beloved by}} {{his people and}} his wife Naganingroem. The {{minister}} Aria Kebonan wants power for himself, and persuades the king to surrender the crown to him. Permana Dikoesoemah warns Aria Kebonan to respect him always and not to bother his wife. He then abdicates to meditate, ultimately ascending to a higher plane of existence. Aria Kebonan, meanwhile, magically gains the king's appearance, ensuring {{that the people of}} Galuh <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> that they have a new king.|$|E

Each Disney world is inhabited by characters from the film: including Hercules and Philoctetes in Olympus Coliseum, and Aladdin, Princess Jasmine and Jafar in Agrabah.

Players travel from one world to another via Gummi Ship.|$|E
5|$|The redback spider's {{affinity}} for human-modified habitat has enabled it to spread to several countries via international shipping and trade. Furthermore, its tolerance to cold {{means that it}} {{has the ability to}} colonise many temperate countries with a winter climate cooler than Australia. This is concerning due to the risks to people being bitten who <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> of its venomous nature, and also to the conservation of local threatened insect species that the redback might prey upon.|$|E

5|$|Doctor Phlox {{receives}} {{a letter from}} his Interspecies Medical Exchange counterpart, Doctor Jeremy Lucas, who is serving a term on Denobula. He begins to compose a letter back, describing his experiences with the crew, {{and the ways in}} which humans are different. Meanwhile, on the Bridge, the crew are discussing a pre-warp vessel they have encountered. The alien they speak with, a Valakian, begs them to assist with a medical emergency their species is facing. Sub-Commander T'Pol reveals that the Vulcans <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> of the species, but she agrees with Captain Archer to help them. Phlox continues his letter, describing the challenges of treating the disease – with over fifty million lives at stake.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} {{serotonin}} syndrome are difficult as many physicians <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> of the diagnosis {{or they may}} miss the syndrome due to its variable manifestations. In 1998 a survey conducted in England found that 85% of the general practitioners that had prescribed the antidepressant nefazodone were unaware of serotonin syndrome. The incidence may be increasing as {{a larger number of}} pro-serotonergic drugs (drugs which increase serotonin levels) are now being used in clinical practice. One postmarketing surveillance study identified an incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000 patient-months for patients who were taking nefazodone. Additionally, around 14 to 16 percent of persons who overdose on SSRIs are thought to develop serotonin syndrome.|$|E
5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary colic (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E
50|$|A 2012 meta {{analysis}} of studies assessing rates of HIV infection among transgender women in 15 countries found that trans women are 49 {{times more likely}} to have HIV than the general population.

5000|$|Ignorantia juris non excusat or ignorantia legis neminem excusat (Latin for [...] "ignorance {{of the law}} excuses not" [...] and [...] "ignorance of law excuses no one" [...] respectively) is a legal {{principle}} {{holding that}} a person who <b>is</b> <b>unaware</b> of a law may not escape liability for violating that law merely because one <b>was</b> <b>unaware</b> of its content.|$|R
5|$|Many HIV-positive people <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> {{that they}} are {{infected}} with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the food}} thrown away {{could have been avoided}} (4,100,000 tonnes, 61 per cent of the total amount of food waste) and with better {{management}} could have been eaten or used. Unavoidable foods, such as vegetable peelings and tea bags, account for 19 per cent of the total, with the remaining 20 per cent being unavoidable through preferences (e.g. bread crusts) and cooking types (e.g. potato skins). However, the vast majority of consumers (90%) <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> of the amount of food they throw away; individuals who believed that their household wasted no food were shown to be throwing away 88kg of avoidable food per year.|$|E
5|$|People {{with cancer}} may not report pain due to costs of {{treatment}}, {{a belief that}} pain is inevitable, an aversion to treatment side effects, fear of developing addiction or tolerance, fear of distracting the doctor from treating the illness, or fear of masking a symptom that is important for monitoring progress of the illness. People {{may be reluctant to}} take adequate pain medicine because they <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> of their prognosis, or may be unwilling to accept their diagnosis. Failure to report pain or misguided reluctance to take pain medicine can be overcome by sensitive coaching.|$|E

5|$|Scholars {{have also}} argued that {{inconsistent}} application of laws in different circuits is inherently unfair. Trevor W. Morrison, for example, claims that circuit splits create potential due process conflicts if criminal defendants <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> that their behavior constitutes criminal activity in that circuit. An article in the New England Journal on Criminal & Civil Confinement also suggested that there {{is the potential for}} the unconstitutional ex post facto application of law after circuit splits are resolved. Additionally, Jesse M. Boodoo argues that federal agencies tasked with enforcing laws throughout the United States may face challenges implementing regulatory measures when federal legislation is interpreted differently in separate circuits.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In the episode, Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) work desperately {{in an attempt to}} discover what is wrong with Mulder, who is imprisoned by his own frenetic brain activity, but they <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> of Agent Diana Fowley’s (Mimi Rogers) duplicity.

5|$|There is no need, under Churchill v Walton, to {{show that}} the conspirators knew that their {{proposed}} course of conduct amounted to a crime, but they must have intended the consequences; if two people conspire to put poison in the victim's tea, this is not a conspiracy to murder unless the poison was intended to kill the victim. The defendants will similarly not be found guilty if they <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> that a crime will result; if two people agree to grow plants, unaware that the plants are illegal, they have not engaged in a conspiracy. On the other hand, if the two people believe the plants to be illegal even though they are not, they could be found guilty.|$|E
