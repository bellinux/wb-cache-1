5|$|Yet Brooks did {{not always}} ennoble her subjects. Inherited wealth freed her from the need to sell her paintings; she did not care whether she pleased her sitters or not, and her wit, when unleashed, could be devastating. A {{striking}} example is her 1914–15 portrait of Elsie de Wolfe, <b>an</b> <b>interior</b> <b>designer</b> whom she felt had copied her monochromatic color schemes. Brooks painted de Wolfe porcelain-pale, in an off-white dress and a bonnet resembling a shower cap; a white ceramic goat placed on a table at her elbow seems to mimic her simpering expression.|$|E

She played the supporting role of Natasha, a South Bombay girl who works as <b>an</b> <b>interior</b> <b>designer.</b> In {{an interview with}} Hindustan Times Koechlin revealed that she was keen to do the film, because after working in films like Dev.D and Shaitan, she feared being typecast in dark roles such as prostitutes, troubled teenagers, and misfits.

Kapadia played the role of Tara Jaiswal, a middle-aged alcoholic woman, <b>an</b> <b>interior</b> <b>designer</b> by profession, and a divorcee who is not allowed to meet with her daughter.

Critics lauded Dil Chahta Hai as a groundbreaking film for its realistic portrayal of Indian youth. The film performed well in the big cities but failed in the rural areas, which was attributed by critics to the urban-oriented lifestyle depicted in the movie. Saibal Chatterjee, in a review for Hindustan Times, noted, [...] "Dimple Kapadia, in a brief, somewhat underdeveloped role, presents a poignant study of loneliness." ...|$|E

In the living room, a wall between the sitting room was removed which created a large, open space to which a vaulted ceiling was added. Perry Ellwood's living room was designed to function with the newly added sunroom and south terrace as one large living and entertaining space. The terrace can be accessed through French doors from both {{the living room and}} sunroom. The living room was designed to reflect English country houses c. 1650, during the Stuart period.

500|$|Despite this {{building}} boom, the centralisation {{of much of}} the government administration, including the king's works, in London, meant that a number of Scottish architects spent most of their careers in England, where they had a major impact on Georgian architecture. Robert Adam (1728–92) emerged as leader of {{the first phase of the}} neo-classical revival in England and Scotland from around 1760 until his death. He rejected the elaborate Palladian style that had dominated building as [...] "ponderous" [...] and [...] "disgustful". However, he continued their tradition of drawing inspiration directly from classical antiquity, influenced by his four-year stay in Europe, where he saw the excavations at Pompeii and Herculaneum, which for the first time allowed modern Europeans to see classical buildings first hand, rather than work from literary descriptions. Neo-classicism strived for greater simplicity, often more influenced by Greek rather than Roman models. Adam's major works in Edinburgh included the General Register House (1774–92), the University Building (1789) and Charlotte Square (1791). He also designed 36 country houses in Scotland. <b>An</b> <b>interior</b> <b>designer</b> as well as an architect, together with his brothers John (1721–92) and James (1732–94) developing the Adam style, he influenced the development of architecture, not just in Britain, but in Western Europe, North America and in Russia, where his patterns were taken by Scottish architect Charles Cameron (1745–1812).|$|E
500|$|William Adam, was the {{foremost}} architect {{of his time}} in Scotland, designing and building numerous country houses and public buildings. Among his best known works are Hopetoun House near Edinburgh, and Duff House in Banff. His individual, exuberant, style was built on the Palladian style, but with Baroque details inspired by Vanbrugh and Continental architecture. After his death, his sons Robert and John took on the family business, which included lucrative work for the Board of Ordnance. Robert emerged as leader of {{the first phase of the}} neo-classical revival in England and Scotland from around 1760 until his death. He rejected the Palladian style as [...] "ponderous" [...] and [...] "disgustful". However, he continued their tradition of drawing inspiration directly from classical antiquity, influenced by his four-year stay in Europe. <b>An</b> <b>interior</b> <b>designer</b> as well as an architect, with his brothers developing the Adam style, he influenced the development of architecture, not just in Britain, but in Western Europe, North America and in Russia, where his patterns were taken by Scottish architect Charles Cameron. Adam's main rival was William Chambers, another Scot, but born in Sweden. He did most of his work in London, with a small number of houses in Scotland. He was appointed architectural tutor to the Prince of Wales, later George III, and in 1766, with Robert Adam, as Architect to the King. More international in outlook than Adam, he combined Neoclassicism and Palladian conventions and his influence was mediated through his large number of pupils.|$|E
