25|$|The average {{human body}} with a relaxed lungful of air is close to neutral buoyancy. If the air is exhaled, most people will sink in fresh water, and with full lungs, most will float in seawater. The amount of weight {{required}} to provide neutral buoyancy to the naked diver is usually trivial, though there <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> require several kilograms of weight to become neutral in seawater due to low average density and large size. This is usually the case with people with {{a large proportion of}} body fat. As the diver is nearly neutral, most ballasting is needed to compensate for the buoyancy of the diver's equipment.|$|E

Kagame responded by saying [...] "I see no problems, but there <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> choose to see problems where there are not." [...] The election was largely peaceful, although there was a further grenade attack in Kigali hours after the election commission announced Kagame's victory, injuring about 20 people. Media reports indicated the attack may have been politically motivated and connected to earlier attacks in the same area.|$|E
500|$|In 2010 Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} a planned spin-off television series, 2013, {{which would have}} been a sequel to the film. 2012 executive producer Mark Gordon told the magazine, [...] "ABC will have an opening in their disaster-related programming after Lost ends, so people would be interested in this topic on a weekly basis. There's hope for the world despite the magnitude of the 2012 disaster as seen in the film.

500|$|Since its broadcast, [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{garnered}} {{little to}} no scrutiny from viewers. Vitti has never gotten any questions about the episode, except from his sister-in-law who wanted him to explain the episode for his nephews. [...] " [...] My sister-in-law called me up saying that I {{needed to talk to}} my nephews about how this was wrong that Homer did", Vitti said. [...] "They watched it and had lots of questions for her. And she referred them all to me. So there <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are still bothered by it." [...] The little amount of scrutiny that the episode attracted took The Simpsons staff by surprise, as they anticipated that the episode would generate a lot of controversy. Instead, [...] "Blame It on Lisa", an episode which aired the previous week, caused an uproar in Brazil because of its depiction of the country. It became one of the biggest controversies the series has ever faced.

The film grossed a total of $7.3million ($ in [...] dollars) worldwide, and was a box office bomb. It was placed at 97 on the top 100 movies of 1987 list. Morton noted that although [...] "Madonna's comic talent was acknowledged, cinemagoers in the United States stayed away in droves." [...] The film was better accepted in the foreign released territories, prompting Madonna to defend herself, rather weakly, that her ideas were better accepted in Europe and Japan, rather than her home country. She added, [...] "I think the movie did badly in America because I upstaged it with my tour. People were confused about the connection between the record, the tour and the movie because they all had the same title. I also think there are people who don't want me to do well in both fields. I had to really fight to get any respect from the music business and now I guess there <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> feel that I ought to be grateful for that respect and stick to music." [...] Nevertheless, Warner Bros. decided to release the film in home media in VHS on November 11, 1987, a decision not approved by Madonna.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Brown {{decided to}} quit EastEnders after {{becoming}} [...] "discontented" [...] {{with the way}} Dot was portrayed. In 1997 she revealed to the Daily Mirror: [...] "I always felt Dot {{was one of those}} characters who should stay the same. She's a simple creature. There <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> the same things happen to them again and again. They never learn [...] When I left, there was all that rubbish about it getting too much for me [...] I stopped because I wasn't being used very much. I thought, 'It's a part-time job'.

I thought: 'What?! That was in 1985, it's 1993!'. I was getting so tetchy, so I thought I'd go. I'd had enough. They were a bit shocked, because apparently there were some good stories coming up." [...] Expanding on this in 2008, Brown stated that she [...] "didn’t like what they were doing with Dot– she was meant to spread the gossip. Originally she was a fountain of knowledge then next thing I know, people are telling Dot what had been happening and I thought, ‘No, this just won’t do’. I was very annoyed, I felt like they had completely changed my character." [...] The character departed on-screen in August 1993, when Dot moved away from the soap's setting to live with her son Nick and his family in Gravesend, Kent.|$|E

[...] "The main difference between the CNN poll and the Pew poll is in the number of respondents who told pollsters that they didn't have an opinion on this topic – 16 percent in the Pew poll compared to only five percent in the CNN survey", said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. [...] "The two polls report virtually the same number who say they oppose gays serving openly in the military, which suggests that there <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> favor that change in policy but for some reason were reluctant to admit that to the Pew interviewers.

2500|$|The Water Babies, a {{fairy tale}} for a land baby by Charles Kingsley (serialised in Macmillan's Magazine 1862–63, {{published}} in book form, with additions, in 1863). Kingsley had been among first to give a favourable review to Darwin's On the Origin of Species, having [...] "long since... learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species", and the story includes a satire on the reaction to Darwin's theory, with the main scientific participants appearing, including Richard Owen and Huxley. In 1892 Thomas Henry Huxley's five-year-old grandson Julian saw the illustration by Edward Linley Sambourne (right) and wrote his grandfather a letter asking: Dear Grandpater– Have you seen a Waterbaby? Did {{you put it in}} a bottle? Did it wonder if it could get out? Could I see it some day?– Your loving Julian. Huxley wrote back: My dear Julian– I could never make sure about that Water Baby...

And whether it’s in school books that teach how to kill Jews, or whether it’s in the political discourse that is spoken either from Fatah or from Hamas, there is a belief that the Jewish people do not have a right to have a Jewish state." [...] Romney added, [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> say should we have a two state solution, and the Israelis would be happy [...] to have a two state solution. It's the Palestinians who don't want a two state solution, they want to eliminate the state of Israel. And I believe America must say the best way to have peace in the Middle East is not for us to vacillate and appease, but it is to say we stand with our friend Israel. We are committed to a Jewish state in Israel. We will not have an inch of difference between ourselves and our ally Israel."

2500|$|Cruyff {{was known}} for his {{technical}} ability, speed, acceleration, dribbling and vision, possessing an awareness of his teammates' positions as an attack unfolded. Despite his unimpressive stature and strength, Cruyff's tactical brain and reading of the game were exceptional. “Football consists of different elements: technique, tactics and stamina,” he told the journalists Henk van Dorp and Frits Barend, in one of the interviews collected in their book Ajax, Barcelona, Cruyff. [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> might have better technique than me, and some may be fitter than me, but the main thing is tactics. With most players, tactics are missing. You can divide tactics into insight, trust and daring. In the tactical area, I think I just have more than most other players." [...] On the concept of technique in football, Cruyff once said: [...] "Technique is not being able to juggle a ball 1,000 times. Anyone can do that by practising. Then you can work in the circus. Technique is passing the ball with one touch, with the right speed, at the right foot of your team mate." [...] As Van Basten noted, “Johan is so technically perfect that even as a boy he stopped being interested in that aspect of the game. He could do everything when he was 20. That’s why he’s been very interested in tactics since he was very young. He sees football situations so clearly that he was always the one to decide how the game should be played.” In 1997, Dutch journalist Hubert Smeets wrote, [...] "Cruyff was the first player who understood that he was an artist, and the first who was able and willing to collectivise the art of sports." [...] Sports writer David Miller believed Cruyff superior to any previous player in his ability to extract the most from others. He dubbed him [...] "Pythagoras in boots" [...] for the complexity and precision of his passes and wrote, [...] "Few have been able to exact, both physically and mentally, such mesmeric control on a match from one penalty area to another." ...|$|E
