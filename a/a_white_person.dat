The defense questioned her identification of her son in the casket in Chicago and a $400 life insurance policy she had taken out on him.|$|E
5|$|U. S. v. Rhodes (1866), one of {{the first}} Thirteenth Amendment cases, tested the Constitutionality of {{provisions}} in the Civil Rights Act of 1866 that granted blacks redress in the federal courts. Kentucky law prohibited blacks from testifying against whites—an arrangement which compromised the ability of Nancy Talbot ("a citizen of the United States of the African race") to reach justice against <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>person</b> accused of robbing her. After Talbot attempted to try the case in federal court, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled this federal option unconstitutional. Noah Swayne (a Supreme Court justice sitting on the Kentucky Circuit Court) overturned the Kentucky decision, holding that without the material enforcement provided by the Civil Rights Act, slavery would not truly be abolished. With In Re Turner (1867), Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase ordered freedom for Elizabeth Turner, a former slave in Maryland who became indentured to her former master.|$|E

25|$|After {{the death}} of Elijah Muhammad, he was succeeded by his son, Warith Deen Mohammed.

As he {{took control of the}} organization, he quickly brought in new reforms. He renamed it the World Community of al-Islam in the West; later it became the American Society of Muslims. It was estimated that there were 200,000 followers of W. D. Mohammed at the time.|$|E

25|$|The 20th-century one-drop rule made it {{relatively}} {{difficult for}} anyone of known Black ancestry {{to be accepted}} as White. The child of an African-American sharecropper and <b>a</b> <b>White</b> <b>person</b> was considered Black by the local communities. In terms of the economics of sharecropping, such a person also would likely become a sharecropper as well, thus adding to the landholder or employer's labor force. In short, this theory suggests that in a 20th-century economy that benefited from sharecropping, it was useful {{to have as many}} Blacks as possible.|$|E
25|$|The seven Pennsylvanian white traders with John Findley/Finley's crew {{consisted}} of James Lowry, David Hendricks, Alexander McGinty, Jabez Evans, Jacob Evans, William Powell, Thomas Hyde, and their Cherokee slave. The white Pennsylvania traders {{shot at the}} 50 Christian Indians, and the 50 Christian Indians (along with Philip Philips), took the whites prisoner, and transported them to Canada, and shipped some of them off to France, as prisoners of war. Findley fled, {{and the next time}} <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>person</b> went to Eskippathiki, the whole town was burnt down to the ground.|$|E

During this time, in a misguided effort to avoid issues of stereotyping and racism Michael asks the employees to name <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>person</b> that they trust and he will name a black person he trusts even more. The name Jesus pops up and Michael replies with Apollo Creed. Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) encourages Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) to pursue Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), and intentionally gives him information about her strong dislikes. Later, Andy strums [...] "The Rainbow Connection" [...] on his banjo while singing falsetto. Pam smiles politely and silently shares the joke with Jim.|$|E
500|$|With Far Cry 3 being a {{commercial}} success, Ubisoft considered the Far Cry series {{one of their}} most important brands, and they hinted that a sequel was in development in June 2013. On October 3, 2013, Martinez mentioned that he was working on the soundtrack for the game. [...] In March 2014 the game's setting and features were leaked. The game was officially announced on May 15, 2014, and the first gameplay footage was revealed during Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014. The game's cover art, which shows the light-skinned Pagan Min resting his hand on a dark-skinned person, caused controversy and accusation of racism. Hutchinson later responded and clarified by saying that Pagan Min is not <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>person,</b> and that the other person depicted is not the game's protagonist. Hutchinson added that the reaction of the community regarding the cover art was [...] "uncomfortable".|$|E

500|$|French plantation-owners {{worked their}} African slaves {{so hard that}} half died within a few years; it was cheaper to import new slaves than to improve working {{conditions}} enough to increase survival. The rate of death of slaves on Saint Domingue's plantations was higher {{than anywhere else in}} the western hemisphere. [...] Over the French colony's hundred-year course, slavery killed about a million Africans, and thousands more chose suicide. Slaves newly arrived from Africa, particularly women, were especially likely to kill themselves; some thought that in death they could return home to Africa. [...] Pregnant slaves usually did not survive long enough or have healthy enough pregnancies to have live babies, but if they did the children often died young. Food was insufficient, and slaves were expected to grow and prepare it for themselves on top of their already crushing, 12-hour workdays. It was legal for a slaveholder to kill a slave who hit <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>person,</b> according to the 1685 Code Noir, a decree by the French king Louis XIV regulating practices of slaves and slavers.|$|E
500|$|John A.

[...] He achieved it with [...] "nerve, courage, {{and a great deal of}} luck," [...] supplemented by [...] "a rifle and shotgun, a road atlas, and Travelguide, a listing of places in America where Negroes can stay without being embarrassed, insulted, or worse." [...] He noted that black drivers needed to be particularly cautious in the South, where they were advised to wear a chauffeur's cap or have one visible on the front seat and pretend they were delivering a car for <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>person.</b> Along the way, he had to endure a stream of [...] "insults of clerks, bellboys, attendants, cops, and strangers in passing cars."

500|$|Diane McWhorter, Pulitzer Prize-winning {{historian}} of the Birmingham civil rights campaign, asserts that To Kill a Mockingbird condemns racism instead of racists, and states that every child in the South has moments of racial cognitive dissonance when they {{are faced with the}} harsh reality of inequality. This feeling causes them to question the beliefs with which they have been raised, which for many children is what the novel does. McWhorter writes of Lee, [...] "for <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>person</b> from the South to write a book like this in the late 1950s is really unusual—by its very existence an act of protest." [...] Author James McBride calls Lee brilliant but stops short of calling her brave: [...] "I think by calling Harper Lee brave you kind of absolve yourself of your own racism... She certainly set the standards in terms of how these issues need to be discussed, but in many ways I feel... the moral bar's been lowered. And that's really distressing. We need a thousand Atticus Finches." [...] McBride, however, defends the book's sentimentality, and the way Lee approaches the story with [...] "honesty and integrity".|$|E
5000|$|From 1790 {{until the}} mid-twentieth century, United States law used racial {{criteria}} to establish citizenship rights and regulate who was eligible {{to become a}} naturalized citizen. The Naturalization Act of 1790, the first law in US history to establish rules for citizenship and naturalization, barred citizenship to all {{people who were not}} of European descent, stating that [...] "any Alien being <b>a</b> free <b>white</b> <b>person,</b> who shall have resided within the limits and {{under the jurisdiction of the}} United States for the term of two years, may be admitted to become a citizen thereof." ...|$|R

5000|$|Swain {{called the}} {{re-election}} of President Barack Obama in 2012, [...] "a very scary situation". In April 2012, she argued that {{civil rights leaders}} like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton had used the death of Trayvon Martin for political gains {{in order to increase}} voter registration for the Democratic Party. In July 2013, she contextualized Trayvon Martin's death by reminding listeners that black-on-white crimes, especially when groups of black youths attack <b>a</b> lone <b>white</b> <b>person,</b> are underreported in the media. A month later, she criticized Martin's mother for failing to address the issues of black-on-black crime rates, unemployment and abortion in black communities.|$|R
500|$|The {{second part}} of the novel deals with what book {{reviewer}} Harding LeMay termed [...] "the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro". In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it [...] "reasonable to believe" [...] that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>person,</b> which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980). In writing about the historical context of the novel's construction, two other literary scholars remark: [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Inevitably, despite its mid-1930s setting, the story told {{from the perspective of the}} 1950s voices the conflicts, tensions, and fears induced by this transition." ...|$|E
500|$|The feminist {{movement}} is periodically criticized for appropriating the massacre {{as a symbol}} of male violence against women. For example, Charles Rackoff, a University of Toronto computer science professor, compared the Ku Klux Klan with those organizing vigils marking the event, writing that [...] "he point is to use the death of these people as an excuse to promote the feminist/extreme left-wing agenda," [...] and adding that it is [...] "no more justified" [...] than the KKK using the [...] "murder of <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>person</b> by a black person as an excuse to promote their agenda." [...] Other critics say that Lépine was a [...] "lone gunman" [...] who does not represent men, and that violence against women is neither condoned nor encouraged officially or unofficially in western culture. In this perspective, feminist memorializing is considered socially divisive on the basis of gender and therefore harmful by bestowing guilt on all men, irrespective of individual propensity to violence against women. Some masculinist and anti-feminist commentators state that feminism has provoked violence against women, and without condoning the shootings, view the massacre as an extreme expression of men's frustrations. A few say that Lépine was a hero of masculism, glorifying his actions.|$|E
2500|$|Chin's {{case has}} been cited by some Asian Americans to {{support the idea that}} they are seen as not fully {{citizens}} or [...] "perpetual foreigners" [...] compared to [...] "real" [...] Americans.

5000|$|The term may be {{considered}} derogatory, reflecting stereotypes of African-American, black British and white culture (when used as synonym of white trash). The wannabe connotation may be used pejoratively, implying a failed attempt at cultural appropriation by <b>a</b> <b>white</b> subject (<b>person).</b> It is also sometimes used in a racist manner by the white culture, not only belittling the person perceived as [...] "acting black", but also demeaning black people and culture, by proxy.
