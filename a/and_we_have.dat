It will be a long job, but we are sure there is a future for angling in the river.|$|E
5|$|In a {{telephone}} interview with Today's Zaman, in 2009, Finkelstein stated:I think Israel, {{as a number of}} commentators pointed out, is becoming an insane state. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to be honest about that. While {{the rest of the world}} wants peace, Europe wants peace, the US wants peace, but this state wants war, war and war. In the first week of the massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran. Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a lunatic state.|$|E
5|$|Men, I know you’ve {{all been}} waiting to learn what this cruise is about, and why we’re still headed southeast.

5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E
5|$|We {{all have}} a Land of Beyond to seek in our life—what more can we ask? Our part {{is to find the}} trail that leads to it. A long trail, a hard trail, maybe; but the call comes to us, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to go. Rooted deep in the nature of every one of us is the spirit of adventure, the call of the wild—vibrating under all our actions, making life deeper and higher and nobler.|$|E

60|$|I have omitted {{to mention}} it, by the by. Miss Mills had sailed, and Dora and I had gone aboard a great East Indiaman at Gravesend to see her; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> had {{preserved}} ginger, and guava, and other delicacies {{of that sort}} for lunch; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> left Miss Mills weeping on a camp-stool on the quarter-deck, with a large new diary under her arm, in which the original reflections awakened by the contemplation of Ocean were to be recorded under lock and key.|$|R

25|$|I {{think that}} in some quarters, {{many parts of the}} country, a white male is really disadvantaged… Because we have {{developed}} this notion of women and minorities being so disadvantaged <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to help them, that we have, in many cases, twisted the thing so that it's no longer a case of equal opportunity. It's a case of putting a fist on the scale.|$|E
25|$|The accompaniments...are {{delightful}} to hear, {{and especially}} does {{the treatment of}} the woodwind compel admiring attention. Schubert himself could hardly have handled those instruments more deftly, written for them more lovingly.... We place the songs and choruses in The Yeomen of the Guard before all his previous efforts of this particular kind. Thus the music follows the book to a higher plane, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage.

25|$|Euric's code {{remained}} in force among the Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula) until {{the reign of}} Liuvigild (568-586), who made a new one, the Codex Revisus, improving upon that of his predecessor. This work is lost, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no direct knowledge of any fragment of it. In the 3rd codification, however, many provisions have been taken from the 2nd, and these are designated by the word antiqua; by means of these antiqua we are enabled in a certain measure to reconstruct the work of Leovigild.|$|E

25|$|Nanotechnology has the {{potential}} to reshape the entire world, Kurzweil exclaims. Assembling materials molecule by molecule could solve energy problems, cure cancer and other diseases, strengthen our bodies, and produce self-assembling food, clothing, and buildings. Kurzweil admits that nanotechnology carries a big risk; a self-replicating substance, without the constraints of a living organism, might grow out of control and consume everything. However he points out that today there are already technologies which pose grave risks, for example nuclear power or weapons, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> managed to keep them relatively safe, so he feels we can probably do the same with nanotechnology.|$|E
25|$|We're all {{involved}} in this: our whole {{way of life}} is structured around the burning of fossil fuels. I find it sobering to think that while I've been travelling the world, trying to record the complexity and beauty of our planet, that I too have been making my own contribution to global warming. As I recognised when I presented Life on Earth all those years ago, we are a flexible and innovative species <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the capacity to adapt and modify our behaviour. Now we most certainly have to do so if we're to deal with climate change. It's the biggest challenge we have yet faced.|$|E
60|$|When we come {{to examine}} in detail what is the sane mind in the sane body, the final test of {{completeness}} {{seems to be a}} security of distinction between what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> professed <b>and</b> what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done; what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> aimed at <b>and</b> what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> achieved; what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> invented <b>and</b> what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> witnessed or had evidenced to us; what <b>we</b> think <b>and</b> feel in the present <b>and</b> what <b>we</b> thought <b>and</b> felt in the past.|$|R

25|$|The line passes {{beneath the}} A39 road from Truro to Falmouth at Treluswell, Four Cross, and then shortly enters Penryn which grew {{up at the}} head of a large inlet of the River Fal. Penryn railway station is at the top of the town, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> views across the town to St Gluvias on the other side of the harbour. The station is eight and a quarter miles from Truro, and the {{platform}} shelter is identical to the one at Perranwell. Beyond the station the line passes over the Collegewood Viaduct. The last timber railway viaduct in Cornwall was here, but was replaced by this stone structure on 22 July 1934.|$|E
25|$|We have {{to adjust}} the AMT. That has to be reduced. We {{have to get rid}} of the death tax, which is going to go to zero in 2010, which is going to create an {{incentive}} – I can't imagine what kind of an incentive it's going to create. It's going to go to zero in 2010. And then in 2011, it's going to go to 55 percent. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to make sure that the tax cuts that went into effect, that that level remains. Otherwise, we're going to have one of the biggest tax increases in history in 2011. And I would look to try to regularize the rates and look for some marginal reduction, even beyond what we're doing right now.|$|E
25|$|The double {{jeopardy}} rule {{means that a}} person cannot be tried more than once for the same offence. It is an important safeguard to acquitted defendants, {{but there is an}} important general public interest in ensuring that those who have committed serious crimes are convicted of them. The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report recognised that the rule is capable of causing grave injustice to victims and the community in certain cases where compelling fresh evidence has come to light after an acquittal. It called for a change in the law to be considered, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> accepted that such a change is appropriate. The European Convention on Human Rights (Article 4(2) of Protocol 7) explicitly recognises the importance of being able to re-open cases where new evidence comes to light.|$|E
