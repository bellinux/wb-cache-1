5|$|Similar to the A centers, B centers do not induce color, and no UV or visible {{absorption}} can {{be attributed}} to the B centers. Early assignment of the N9 absorption system to the B center have been disproven later. The B center has a characteristic IR absorption spectrum (see the infrared absorption picture above) with <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>peak</b> at 1332cm−1 and a broader feature at 1280cm−1.

25|$|The {{phase curve}} of Mercury is very steep, which is {{characteristic}} of a body on which bare regolith (soil) is exposed to view. At phase angles exceeding 90° (crescent phase) the brightness falls off especially sharply. The shape of the phase curve indicates a mean slope {{on the surface of}} Mercury of about 16°, which is slightly smoother than that of the Moon. Approaching phase angle 0° (fully illuminated phase) the curve rises to <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>peak.</b> This surge in brightness is called the opposition effect because for most bodies (though not Mercury) it occurs at astronomical opposition when the body is opposite from the Sun in the sky. The width of the opposition surge for Mercury indicates that both the compaction state of the regolith and the distribution of particle sizes on the planet are similar to those on the Moon.|$|E

2500|$|Uncertainty exists {{regarding}} {{the duration of}} the overall extinction and about the timing and duration of various groups' extinctions within the greater process. Some evidence suggests that there were multiple extinction pulses or that the extinction was spread out over a few million years, with <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>peak</b> in the last million years of the Permian. Statistical analyses of some highly fossiliferous strata in Meishan, Zhejiang Province in southeastern China, suggest that the main extinction was clustered around one peak. Recent research shows that different groups became extinct at different times; for example, while difficult to date absolutely, ostracod and brachiopod extinctions were separated by 670 to 1170 thousand years. In a well-preserved sequence in east Greenland, the decline of animals is concentrated in a period 10 to [...] long, with plants taking several hundred thousand additional years to show the full impact of the event. An older theory, still supported in some recent papers, is that there were two major extinction pulses 9.4 million years apart, separated by a period of extinctions well above the background level, and that the final extinction killed off only about 80% of marine species alive at that time while the other losses occurred during the first pulse or the interval between pulses. According to this theory one of these extinction pulses occurred {{at the end of the}} Guadalupian epoch of the Permian.|$|E

6000|$|I {{repeatedly}} {{ascended the}} north flank of Tukcham along a watercourse, {{by the side}} of which were immense slips of rocks and snow-beds; the mountain-side being excessively steep. Some of the masses of gneiss thus brought down were dangerously poised on slopes of soft shingle, and daily moved a little downwards. All the rocks were gneiss and granite, with radiating crystals of tourmaline as thick as the thumb. Below 12,000 to 13,000 feet the mountain-sides were covered with a dense scrub of rhododendron bushes, except where broken by rocks, landslips, and torrents: above this the winter's snow lay deep, and black rocks and small glaciers, over which avalanches were constantly falling with a sullen roar, forbade all attempts to proceed. My object in ascending was chiefly to obtain views and compass- bearings, in which I was generally disappointed: once only I had a magnificent prospect of Kinchinjunga, sweeping down in one unbroken mass of glacier and ice, fully 14,000 feet high, {{to the head of the}} Thlonok river, whose upper valley appeared a broad bay of ice; doubtless forming one of the largest glaciers in the Himalaya, and increased by lateral feeders that flow into it from either flank of the valley. The south side of this (the Thlonok) valley is formed by a range from Kinchinjunga, running east to Tukcham, where it terminates: from it rises the beautiful mountain Liklo,* [D2 of the peaks laid down in Colonel Waugh's [...] "Trigonometrical Survey from Dorjiling," [...] I believe to be the [...] "Liklo" [...] of Dr. Campbell's itineraries from Dorjiling to Lhassa, compiled from the information of the traders (See [...] "Bengal Asiatic Society's Journal" [...] for 1848); the routes in which proved of the utmost value to me.] 22,582 feet high, which, from Dorjiling, appears as <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>peak,</b> but is here seen to be a jagged crest running north and south. On the north flank of the valley the mountains are more sloping and black, with patches of snow above 15,000 feet, but little anywhere else, except on another beautiful peak (alt. 19,240 feet) marked D3 on the map. This flank is also continuous from Kinchin; it divides Sikkim from Tibet, and runs north-east to the great mountain Chomiomo (which was not visible), the streams from its north flank flowing into the Arun river (in Tibet). A beautiful blue arch of sky spanned all this range, indicating the dry Tibetan climate beyond.|$|E

3000|$|... as {{implied by}} (57), the DFT bins {{are no longer}} {{decoupled}} because of the time-domain windowing by W_ 10 W^H_ 10.
