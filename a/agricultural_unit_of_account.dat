40|$|In the paper, {{an analogy}} with length {{measurement}} is applied {{in order to}} explore the nature <b>of</b> the <b>unit</b> for value measurement, i. e. the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account.</b> As the meter {{is defined as the}} length traveled by light in vacuum during 1 / 299 792 458 of a second, the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> krona is defined as the purchasing power of the medium of exchange krona. However, one should be cautious when drawing conclusions from this analogy. Our <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> is defined in our medium of exchange, but it is meaningful only because we can observe prices on real goods expressed in it. As it would be pointless to define the meter as the length traveled by light in vacuum during 1 / 299 792 458 of a second if we could not compare this length with anything else, it would be pointless to define our <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> in something that is not priced. In the paper it is explained how different payment techniques help to overcome transaction costs in the market. In particular, following Alchian (1977), it is argued that to reap the full benefit from the use of payment techniques, it has to be combined with the use <b>of</b> both a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> and specialist middlemen. The use of payment techniques helps to reduce costs due to sequential payment, but to reduce costs due to sequential quality evaluation, you need <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> as well as reputable middlemen.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{commentators}} {{have argued that}} technological innovation {{is about to change}} the institutional structure of the retail payments system.

The recent literature and Menger’s views on the subject are surveyed. Furthermore, the question is analyzed from an evolutionary point of view based on the interpretation of new electronic payments systems as networks The strategic incentives for issuers and users of currency to switch from the existing dominant <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> to an alternative one are discussed.
