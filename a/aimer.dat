5|$|The {{vertical}} {{line on the}} sight was relatively short, {{and could not be}} used directly to measure drift – unlike the long drift wires of the CSBS it replaced. To address this, the collimator handle could be used to manually rotate the sighting assembly forward, allowing the bomb <b>aimer</b> to point the sight further in front of the aircraft's location. This allowed the bomb <b>aimer</b> to select any convenient object on the ground for drift measurements, including the target itself, long before the aircraft reached it. Through periodic movements of the handle, the bomb <b>aimer</b> could ensure the drift line continued to pass through the target. When the handle was returned to the resting position and released, the shaft to the computor automatically re-engaged and started tracking the proper range angle again. The handle was also used to rotate the collimator forward for storage.|$|E
5|$|With the CSBS the {{sighting}} system and calculator {{were the same}} device, which required the bombsight to be fairly large. With this restriction removed, the sight head was much smaller and lighter than the older versions. The resulting sight head was easy to mount on a stabilizer system, adapted from the same Sperry gyroscope as earlier experiments. With the sight head stabilized, the bomb <b>aimer</b> could continue to measure drift even as he indicated turns to the pilot, eliminating the need to correct, re-measure and correct again. The remote console and second operator eliminated {{the need for the}} bomb <b>aimer</b> to look away from the sights, to make adjustments while on the bomb run. As a result of these changes, short aiming periods of a few seconds would be enough for an accurate drop.|$|E
5|$|In 1917 Harry Wimperis {{introduced}} the Course Setting Bomb Sight (CSBS), which replaced {{the tables and}} timings used in earlier sights with a simple mechanical calculator capable of solving the sideways drift due to the wind. As the bomb <b>aimer</b> turned a wind direction knob, the main portion of the sight was pushed {{to the left or}} right, indicating the required angle to fly. The CSBS was the first bombsight that allowed the bomber to approach the target from any direction, which offered greatly increased tactical freedom.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{his service}} to Diefenbaker, <b>Aimers</b> worked as {{administrative}} assistant to Progressive Conservative Members of Parliament Robert Coates in 1972 and Stanley Schumacher in 1973. He served as national {{president of the}} Progressive Conservative Youth Federation in 1977. <b>Aimers</b> resigned from the Progressive Conservative Party in 1978, joining the Liberals, to protest what he called [...] "the shafting of Stan Schumacher" [...] by the party. Schumacher, a 10-year veteran Member of Parliament lost his bid for renomination after he {{refused to give up}} his Bow River riding in favour of PC leader Joe Clark who was losing his own riding due to redistribution. <b>Aimers</b> accused the party's national executive of directing a campaign against Schumacher's renomination bid in order to punish him.|$|R
5|$|The bomb sight {{was also}} {{supplied}} with the Emergency Computor, a simple circular slide rule for use when the main computor stopped working. In {{this case the}} bomb <b>aimer</b> would dial in the same basic parameters on the various disks, and read out the proper sighting angle at the bottom. Wind had to be estimated and calculated by hand. The angles were then entered manually into the sight; the drive cables were clutched out, the aiming angle entered using the operating handle, and the drift angle set by a small locking screw.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the He 111 A-L {{initially}} had a conventional stepped cockpit, {{with a pair of}} windscreen-like panels for the pilot and co-pilot. The He 111P and subsequent production variants were fitted with fully glazed cockpits and a laterally asymmetric nose, with the port side having the greater curvature for the pilot, offsetting the bombardier to starboard. The resulting stepless cockpit, which was a feature on a number of German bomber designs during the war years in varying shapes and formats, no longer had the separate windscreen panels for the pilot. Pilots had to look outside through the same bullet-like glazing that was used by the bombardier and navigator. The pilot was seated on the left and the navigator/bomb <b>aimer</b> on the right. The navigator went forward to the prone bomb-aiming position or could tilt his chair to one side, to move into the rear of the aircraft. There was no cockpit floor below the pilot's feet—the rudder pedals being on arms—giving very good visibility below. Sliding and removable panels were manufactured into the nose glazing to allow the pilot, navigator and or bomb <b>aimer</b> to exit the aircraft quickly, without a time-consuming retreat into the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|The main {{design feature}} of the Mk. XIV was that it gave the bomb <b>aimer</b> more {{time to work on}} the problem of {{bringing}} the aircraft to the proper location to drop the bombs. As the calculations of this location were being carried out automatically, he could concentrate solely on the sight throughout the bomb run. The sight projected crosshairs into space so they were in focused at infinity, allowing the user to focus their eyes on the target and not have to change focus to see the line.|$|E

5|$|Another {{solution}} to {{the vulnerability of the}} RAF bombers was to fly at night, which was taken up as the primary tactic of Bomber Command. The Mk. X proved {{to be very difficult to}} read at night and bombers that carried it were quickly refitted with the earlier Mk. VII or Mk. IX sight. The Norden was unable to work at night at all; the bomb <b>aimer</b> had to locate the target long in advance of the drop point using a built-in telescope and targets were simply not visible at the required distances in low light.|$|E
5|$|Brooks {{trained in}} Brandon, Manitoba through October {{prior to being}} sent to a Winnipeg {{equipment}} depot {{to serve as a}} guard. He then undertook several training phases across the country in Regina, Saskatchewan, London, Toronto, Malton, and Fingal, Ontario, and finally Rivers, Manitoba, prior to graduating in August 1941 as a Navigator - Bomb <b>Aimer.</b> Arriving in Britain at the end of September, he was sent to RAF Kinloss the following month and trained there until February 1942, when he joined the RCAF's 419 Bomber Squadron. On April 8–9, during only his second mission, he was shot down during a bombing raid and landed near Oldenburg, Germany, where he was quickly taken as a prisoner of war and sent to Dulag Luft.|$|E
5|$|The inputs {{operated}} by the bomb-aimer's mate drove a mechanical calculator inside the console, or computor. The output of the calculator drove flexible shafts that rotated the sight head to the proper angles in azimuth and altitude, representing the wind drift and range angle. The sight head replaced the older wire crosshairs with a modern reflector sight that {{was easy to see}} at night. The sight could be rotated manually to view objects well in front of the aircraft, allowing the bomb <b>aimer</b> to select among a wider variety of objects to use for drift measurements.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aimers</b> {{had been}} an activist in the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada's youth wing and became {{personally}} close to former Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, serving as his administrative assistant for two summers 1969 to 1970. The two shared a conviction {{that the government of}} Pierre Trudeau was undermining the status of the monarchy in Canada. In 1970, while a university student, <b>Aimers</b> and others founded the Monarchist League of Canada in an attempt to galvanize monarchists and shore up support for the institution.|$|R
50|$|The Monarchist League of Canada {{was founded}} in 1970 by John <b>Aimers</b> and was federally {{incorporated}} in 1976. It was founded after <b>Aimers</b> attended a 1969 tour of Canada by Lieut.-Col. J. C. du Parc Braham, chancellor of the London-based Monarchist League The newly formed MLC inherited a list of 50 Canadian members of the British-based league and was founded several months later at an Ottawa meeting in June 1970. Within a year, the League claimed 3,000 members and 10 branches across Canada.|$|R

5|$|What {{was needed}} was a new bombsight, one that could be very quickly set up, had useful {{illumination}} of the crosshairs for night use and was stabilized so the bomb <b>aimer</b> could watch the approach as the bomber was manoeuvring. An early attempt was the Mk. XI, which mounted a cut-down CSBS {{on the front of}} a gyro unit taken from a Sperry Gyroscope artificial horizon, to provide stabilization in the horizontal plane, useful for aiding drift measurements and corrections. It was no easy task to manually calculate the range angle on the Course and Speed Calculator. Although introduced in 1941, only a small number were produced.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the bomb}} run {{the pilot was}} {{directed}} to fly the aircraft in several different directions in sequence, preferably about 120 degrees apart. On each leg, the bomb <b>aimer</b> used the reticle to measure the drift angle, either by rotating the wind direction dial on the computor to get the sight head to the right angle, or by unlocking the azimuth control from the computor and turning the sight manually. The drift angle was whatever angle the sight head was pointing when objects on the ground could {{be seen to be}} moving along the line on the sight. Once measured, the angle of the aircraft and the angle of the drift (measured either from the dial on the computor or the scale on the sight) were recorded. Using the Mk. III Navigation Computor, the RAF's version of the modern E6B, the three sets of angles were entered on the wind calculator face. This normally resulted in a small triangular area forming where the three lines came close to meeting, and the centre of this triangle revealed the wind speed and direction. This value was then entered into the computor.|$|E

25|$|Although the CSBS {{and similar}} designs allowed the {{calculation}} of the proper flight angle needed to correct for windage, it was normally not visible to the pilot. In early bombers the bomb <b>aimer</b> was normally positioned {{in front of the}} pilot and could indicate corrections by hand signals, but as aircraft grew larger it became common for the pilot and bomb <b>aimer</b> to be separated. This led to the introduction of the pilot direction indicator, or PDI. These typically consisted of a pair of electrical pointers mounted in a conventional aircraft instrument panel mount (a small dial). The bombardier used switches to move the pointer on his unit, which was repeated in the cockpit in front of the pilot.|$|E
25|$|The Whitley had {{a crew of}} five: a pilot, co-pilot/navigator, a bomb <b>aimer,</b> a {{wireless}} operator, and a rear gunner. The pilot and second pilot/navigator {{sat side by side}} in the cockpit, with the wireless operator further back. The navigator rotated to use the chart table behind him. The bomb <b>aimer</b> position was in the nose with a gun turret located directly above. The fuselage aft of the wireless operator was divided horizontally by the bomb bay; behind the bomb bay was the main entrance and aft of that the rear turret. The offensive armaments were stowed in two separate bomb bays housed within the fuselage, along with a further 14 smaller cells contained within the wing area. Bomb racks capable of holding larger bombs were installed on the Whitley Mk III variant.|$|E

5000|$|An Australian {{branch of}} the Monarchist League was founded in 1943. Prior to 1993, due to the growing battle with {{republicans}} {{it was felt that}} it needed to be an exclusively Australian body to defer criticisms that it was just an offshoot of a UK group; it severed its affiliation in 1993, and became an independent group, the Australian Monarchist League. The separate Monarchist League of Australia replaced it as an affiliate in 2006. The Monarchist League of New Zealand and the Monarchist League of Canada were founded independently of the London-based Monarchist League and had no formal affiliation; however the Canadian league was formed by John <b>Aimers</b> after he attended a 1969 tour of Canada by Lieut.-Col. J. C. du Parc Braham, chancellor of the London-based League. The Canadian League, was formed months later with du Parc Braham having given <b>Aimers</b> a list of 50 Canadian members of the British-based league. [...] The Monarchist League remained in close contact with the Canadian group, and on 11 March 1989, Lord Nicholas Hervey had a long meeting at London's Savoy Hotel with Mr <b>Aimers,</b> then Chairman of the Monarchist League of Canada, in order to examine ways in which the two groups could co-operate more closely.|$|R
