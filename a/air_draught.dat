The Royal Portbury Dock is located on the southern side of the mouth of the river. The deepwater dock was constructed between 1972 and 1977, and is now a major port for the import of motor vehicles. The Royal Portbury Dock has the largest entrance lock into any UK port, accommodating vessels up to [...] beam, [...] length and [...] draft. The Avonmouth Docks are {{on the north side of}} the river and are one of the UK's major ports for chilled foods, especially fruit and vegetables. The first dock at Avonmouth, Avonmouth Old Dock, was opened in 1877 and acquired by Bristol Corporation in 1884. In 1907, a much larger dock, the Royal Edward Dock, was opened. The docks form part of the Port of Bristol and were operated by the Port of Bristol Authority, part of Bristol City Council, until 1991 when the council granted a 150-year lease to the Bristol Port Company. Currently, pilotage is provided by Bristol Pilots LLP who supply authorised pilots for the River Avon and Bristol City docks, as well as the Severn estuary and the Bristol channel. They are based at Avonmouth docks in Bristol.|$|E

60|$|The steamers, {{which are}} {{constantly}} smoking their pipes {{up and down}} the Thames, offer much the most agreeable mode of getting to London. At least, it might be exceedingly agreeable, except for the myriad floating particles of soot from the stove-pipe, and the heavy heat of midsummer sunshine on the unsheltered deck, or the chill, misty <b>air</b> <b>draught</b> of a cloudy day, and the spiteful little showers of rain that may spatter down upon you at any moment, whatever the promise of the sky; besides which there is some slight inconvenience from the inexhaustible throng of passengers, who scarcely allow you standing-room, nor so much as a breath of unappropriated air, and never a chance to sit down. If these difficulties, added to the possibility of getting your pocket picked, weigh little with you, the panorama along the shores of the memorable river, and the incidents and shows of passing life upon its bosom, render the trip far preferable to the brief yet tiresome shoot along the railway track. On one such voyage, a regatta of wherries raced past us, and at once involved every soul on board our steamer in the tremendous excitement of the struggle. The spectacle was but a moment within our view, and presented nothing more than a few light skiffs, in each of which sat a single rower, bare-armed, and with little apparel, save a shirt and drawers, pale, anxious, with every muscle on the stretch, and plying his oars in such fashion that the boat skimmed along with the aerial celerity of a swallow. I wondered at myself for so immediately catching an interest in the affair, which seemed to contain no very exalted rivalship of manhood; but, whatever the kind of battle or the prize of victory, it stirs one's sympathy immensely, and is even awful, to behold the rare sight of a man thoroughly in earnest, doing his best, putting forth all there is in him, and staking his very soul (as these rowers appeared willing to do) {{on the issue of the}} contest. It was the seventy-fourth annual regatta of the Free Watermen of Greenwich, and announced itself as under the patronage of the Lord Mayor and other distinguished individuals, at whose expense, I suppose, a prize-boat was offered to the conqueror, and some small amounts of money to the inferior competitors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The SEATTLER {{solar power}} plant, {{consisting}} of a tall tower where the atmospheric air is heated by a heliostat array through a solar receiver and drives an air turbine by the new mechanism of cold <b>air</b> gravity <b>draught,</b> is modeled into a mathematical integral equivalent. The all-air working fluid principle is proposed {{as the result of}} an encouraging previous, small scale research sponsored by the CNCSIS Grant No. 27642 of 14 March 2005 in Romania. The presented numerical investigation on the model is targeted towards demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of the all-air system at full scale. The natural peculiarities of the solar tower systems are connected to their small working pressures and, in the present case, to the medium working temperatures in particular. At the same time, air enthalpy capture efficiencies between 65 % and 80 % are known within the SOLAIR project in Spain, while the SEATTLER efficiency could go much further. The alternative here evoked is focused on preliminary temperature ranges of 100 - 300 C and over 1300 C. In either case simple and high efficiency solar radiation solid-air heat exchangers are to be yet developed. Due to the small pressure variations along the gasdynamic channel, the mathematical model here presented proves a high instability in regard to the assumptions introduced and to the limit conditions of the flow at entrance and exit of the tower. The quasi-resonance behavior is demonstrated through several independent paths. The characteristic of the turbine tower proves markedly different from the simple, warm <b>air</b> thermal <b>draught</b> in high stacks...|$|R

5000|$|Air draft (or <b>air</b> <b>draught)</b> is the {{distance}} {{from the surface of the}} water to the highest point on a vessel.

40|$|Airtightness {{and control}} of the {{internal}} ventilation are among the main factors to be considered in order to evaluate the energy efficiency of a building; moreover, they both strongly influence indoor air quality. Building airtightness has several advantages, such as the reduction of uncontrolled passage of cold draughts and of interstitial condensation. Non-adequate building envelope airtightness can cause mould formation. Some moulds are not infectious, while others produce toxic substances called “mycotoxins” that cause serious infections in more vulnerable people. Other types, such as Cryptococcus, may instead endanger everyone’s health. The sick building syndrome is one of the unpleasant consequences of uncontrolled <b>air</b> <b>draughts,</b> which contribute to the distribution of spores within the environment. Therefore, in order to verify the energy and environmental performance of the building related to airtightness, the “Blower Door Test” is used to measure the hourly rate of air exchange caused by the inaccurate installation of doors and windows, to the presence of passing pipelines or to common construction defects. The test is carried on closing all the openings and placing a fan as temporary replacement of a door. The test, carried on {{with the aid of a}} thermal imaging camera to identify the critical points and optimize the airtightness, gives general information about the construction quality. The paper presents the testing method and the results of air permeability “Blower Door Test – Method A”, carried out on March 6 th, 2015 at a private residence located in Fiume Veneto, PN, Italy. The test verified that the value fell within the limits for the building certification according to the CasaClima A Protocol. The paper wants to highlight how an appropriate level of building airtightness, together with a mechanical ventilation system, allows reducing heat losses but also contributes to improve the quality of indoor air with the reduction of pathologies for users...|$|R

40|$|The present {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} airflow pattern in naturally ventilated buildings using advanced computer simulation {{techniques such as}} field or Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models. In particular, two-equation turbulence models, such as the Standard k-ε, the RNG k-ε, the “Realizable” k-ε, {{as well as the}} Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) are used to predict the flow field in and around the buildings considered. In the case of the Standard k-ε model the potential of improving the prediction accuracy is investigated by means of the following ways: (a) Application of a Two-layer Standard k-ε model, and (b) Modification according to the inlet flow variables profiles of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL). The aforementioned turbulence models and the proposed modifications are passive ventilation of a pilot building and of a real-scale building subject to actual passive ventilation (for which an experimental procedure is conducted). The CFD model is then used for the prediction of thermal comfort in naturally ventilated buildings by implementing the most appropriate thermal comfort indices (TCI), such as the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), which, according to literature information, is modified for pure natural ventilation as follows: (a) Extension to account for the metabolic-rate reduction expected in warm environments and for the expectancy factor due to occupant’s habitat, and (b) Correction of the PMV for humidity effects, based on the Standard Effective Temperature (SET*). The present thermal comfort model is completed with the implementation of the Percentage Dissatisfied (PD) index to account for discomfort due to <b>air</b> <b>draughts</b> as well. Additionally, Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) indices are also implemented in the CFD model, i. e. the ventilation effectiveness related to the removal of common pollutants. Following the aforementioned coupled model (CFD-TC/IAQ) a database of input-output pairs is formed, which is used to train and validate radial basis functions (RBF) artificial neural networks (ANN) according to the fuzzy means method. The ANN distributions are then utilized to formulate a multiobjective optimization problem, which accounts for the available thermal comfort and indoor air quality indices, occupant activity level and special constraints provided by design guidelines. The problem is confronted using a gradient-based algorithm associated with a special handling of constraints and of the initialization space of the design variables (Initialization Grid Concept, IGC). Additionally, a technique to account for the non-dominated solutions of the objective functions according to the Pareto criteria is also introduced. Finally, for each case studied the optimal designs are presented by means of nomographs, which may serve as look-up tables for either decision-making strategies or automated systems to create “Intelligent Buildings”. ...|$|R
