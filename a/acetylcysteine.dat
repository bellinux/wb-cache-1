5|$|If {{the patient}} {{presents}} {{less than eight}} hours after paracetamol overdose, then <b>acetylcysteine</b> significantly {{reduces the risk of}} serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival. If <b>acetylcysteine</b> is started more than 8hours after ingestion, there is a sharp decline in its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun, and the risk of acute liver necrosis and death increases dramatically. Although <b>acetylcysteine</b> is most effective if given early, it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48hours after ingestion. In clinical practice, if the patient presents more than eight hours after the paracetamol overdose, then activated charcoal is not useful, and <b>acetylcysteine</b> is started immediately. In earlier presentations, charcoal can be given when the patient arrives and <b>acetylcysteine</b> is initiated while waiting for the paracetamol level results to return from the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|If an anaphylactoid {{reaction}} occurs the <b>acetylcysteine</b> is temporarily halted or {{slowed and}} antihistamines and other supportive care is administered. For example, a nebulised beta-agonist like salbutamol may be {{indicated in the}} event of significant bronchospasm (or prophylactically in patients with a history of bronchospasm secondary to <b>acetylcysteine).</b> It is also important to closely monitor fluids and electrolytes.|$|E
5|$|In United States practice, {{intravenous}} (IV) {{and oral}} administration {{are considered to}} be equally effective and safe if given within 8hours of ingestion. However, IV is the only recommended route in Australasian and British practice. Oral <b>acetylcysteine</b> is given as a 140mg/kg loading dose followed by 70mg/kg every four hours for 17 more doses, and if the patient vomits within 1 hour of dose, the dose must be repeated. Oral <b>acetylcysteine</b> may be poorly tolerated due to its unpleasant taste, odor, and its tendency to cause nausea and vomiting. If repeated doses of charcoal are indicated because of another ingested drug, then subsequent doses of charcoal and <b>acetylcysteine</b> should be staggered.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} the most benefit from {{activated}} charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion. Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have delayed gastric emptying due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination. There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote <b>acetylcysteine.</b> Studies have shown that 39% less <b>acetylcysteine</b> is absorbed into the body when they are administered together. There are conflicting recommendations regarding whether to change the dosing of oral <b>acetylcysteine</b> after the administration of activated charcoal, and even whether the dosing of <b>acetylcysteine</b> needs to be altered at all. Intravenous acetylcystine has no interaction with activated charcoal.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} no studies so far on the {{effectiveness}} of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, <b>acetylcysteine.</b>|$|E
5|$|A 2016 {{systematic}} review examined antioxidant medications, such as allopurinol and <b>acetylcysteine,</b> as add on treatment for schizophrenia. Evidence was insufficient to determine benefits {{and there was}} potential for adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|<b>Acetylcysteine,</b> {{also called}} N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce {{paracetamol}} toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite {{so that it}} does not damage cells and can be safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than <b>acetylcysteine.</b> Additionally, <b>acetylcysteine</b> {{has been shown to be}} a more effective antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, <b>acetylcysteine</b> {{has been}} confirmed, {{in a recent}} {{double-blind}} placebo-controlled trial conducted by the US military, to reduce the effects of blast induced mild traumatic brain and neurological injury in soldiers. Multiple animal studies have also demonstrated its efficacy in reducing the damage associated with moderate traumatic brain or spinal injury, and also ischemia-induced brain injury. In particular, it has been demonstrated through multiple studies to significantly reduce neuronal losses and to improve cognitive and neurological outcomes associated with these traumatic events. <b>Acetylcysteine</b> has been safely used to treat paracetamol overdose for over forty years and is extensively used in emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect to <b>acetylcysteine</b> {{treatment}} is an anaphylactoid reaction, usually manifested by rash, wheeze, or mild hypotension. Adverse reactions {{are more common}} in people treated with IV <b>acetylcysteine,</b> occurring in up to 20% of patients. Alaphylactoid reactions {{are more likely to}} occur with the first infusion (the loading dose). Rarely, severe life-threatening reactions may occur in predisposed individuals, such as patients with asthma or atopic dermatitis, and may be characterized by respiratory distress, facial swelling, and even death.|$|E
5|$|Inducing {{vomiting}} with syrup of ipecac has {{no role in}} paracetamol overdose {{because the}} vomiting it induces delays the effective administration of activated charcoal and oral <b>acetylcysteine.</b> Liver injury is extremely rare after acute accidental ingestion in children under 6 years of age. Children with accidental exposures do not require gastrointestinal decontamination with either gastric lavage, activated charcoal, or syrup of ipecac.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{may include}} {{activated}} charcoal {{if the person}} presents soon after the overdose. Attempting to force the person to vomit is not recommended. If {{there is a potential}} for toxicity, the antidote <b>acetylcysteine</b> is recommended. The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours. Psychiatric care may be required following recovery. A liver transplant may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on low blood pH, high blood lactate, poor blood clotting, or significant hepatic encephalopathy. With early treatment liver failure is rare. Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.|$|E
5|$|Other {{antioxidants}} are not {{obtained from}} the diet, but instead {{are made in the}} body. For example, ubiquinol (coenzyme Q) is poorly absorbed from the gut and is made through the mevalonate pathway. Another example is glutathione, which is made from amino acids. As any glutathione in the gut is broken down to free cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid before being absorbed, even large oral intake has little effect on the concentration of glutathione in the body. Although large amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids such as <b>acetylcysteine</b> can increase glutathione, no evidence exists that eating high levels of these glutathione precursors is beneficial for healthy adults.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been shown that chicken soup {{contains}} the Amino acid cysteine, which is very similar to <b>acetylcysteine,</b> which is used by doctors for patients with bronchitis and other respiratory infections to help clear them.|$|E
25|$|Preparations {{which contain}} {{paracetamol}} may also induce severe liver toxicity resulting from paracetamol poisoning. The exact {{form of the}} preparation used should be identified immediately if possible, as patients who have also overdosed on paracetamol can reduce/avoid permanent liver damage with the administration of <b>acetylcysteine.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{prognosis}} {{is good for}} paracetamol overdoses if treatment is initiated up to 8 hours after the drug has been taken. Most hospitals stock the antidote (<b>acetylcysteine),</b> which replenishes the liver's supply of glutathione, allowing the NAPQI to be metabolized safely. Without early administration of the antidote, fulminant liver failure follows, often in combination with kidney failure, and death generally occurs within several days.|$|E
25|$|Patients with decompensated {{cirrhosis}} generally require {{admission to}} a hospital, with close {{monitoring of the}} fluid balance, mental status, and emphasis on adequate nutrition and medical treatment â€“ often with diuretics, antibiotics, laxatives or enemas, thiamine and occasionally steroids, <b>acetylcysteine</b> and pentoxifylline. Administration of saline is avoided, as it would add to the already high total body sodium content that typically occurs in cirrhosis.|$|E
25|$|Melting ulcers are {{a type of}} {{corneal ulcer}} {{involving}} progressive loss of stroma in a dissolving fashion. This is most commonly seen in Pseudomonas infection, {{but it can be}} caused by other types of bacteria or fungi. These infectious agents produce proteases and collagenases which break down the corneal stroma. Complete loss of the stroma can occur within 24 hours. Treatment includes antibiotics and collagenase inhibitors such as <b>acetylcysteine</b> and homologous blood serum. Surgery may be necessary.|$|E
25|$|It {{was shown}} that {{endogenous}} sulfur dioxide {{plays a role}} in diminishing an experimental lung damage caused by oleic acid. Endogenous sulfur dioxide lowered lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, oxidative stress and inflammation during an experimental lung damage. Conversely, a successful lung damage caused a significant lowering of endogenous sulfur dioxide production, and an increase in lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, oxidative stress and inflammation. Moreover, blockade of an enzyme that produces endogenous SO2 significantly increased the amount of lung tissue damage in the experiment. Conversely, adding <b>acetylcysteine</b> or glutathione to the rat diet increased the amount of endogenous SO2 produced and decreased the lung damage, the free radical formation, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Refractory corneal ulcers {{can take}} a long time to heal, {{sometimes}} months. Topical antibiotics are used continually to prevent infection. Pain medications are given as needed. Loose epithelium is removed with a dry cotton swab under topical anesthesia. This is in order to allow production of normal basement membrane and division of normal epithelium. Often further treatment is necessary, such as a keratotomy, which is superficial cutting or piercing of the cornea. There are two main types used in dogs: multiple punctate keratotomy (MPK) and grid keratotomy (GK). MPK involves making small superficial punctures into the cornea with a needle. GK is more commonly used and involves making parallel and perpendicular scratches in the corneal surface. Usually only topical anesthesia is necessary. By scoring the corneal surface, anchoring points are provided for attachment of new epithelium. Of course, these procedures should only be performed by a veterinarian, particularly one with some experience in this treatment. Complete healing takes about three to four weeks. Keratotomies may lead to corneal sequestration in cats. Other medications have been shown to be useful in topical treatment of refractory ulcers, including glycosaminoglycans such as sodium hyaluronate and chondroitin sulfate, aminocaproic acid, and <b>acetylcysteine.</b>|$|E
500|$|Intravenous <b>acetylcysteine</b> {{is given}} as a {{continuous}} infusion over 20 hours for a total dose 300mg/kg. Recommended administration involves infusion of a 150mg/kg loading dose over 15 to 60minutes, followed by a 50mg/kg infusion over four hours; the last 100mg/kg are infused over the remaining 16hours of the protocol. Intravenous <b>acetylcysteine</b> {{has the advantage of}} shortening hospital stay, increasing both doctor and patient convenience, and allowing administration of activated charcoal to reduce absorption of both the paracetamol and any co-ingested drugs without concerns about interference with oral <b>acetylcysteine.</b> [...] Intravenous dosing varies with weight, specifically in children. For patients less than 20kg, the loading dose is 150mg/kg in 3 mL/kg diluent, administered over 60 minutes; the second dose is 50mg/kg in 7 mL/kg diluent over 4 hours; and the third and final dose is 100mg/kg in 14 mL/kg diluent over 16 hours.|$|E
500|$|Other {{agents that}} have been {{investigated}} for use in treatment of HRS include pentoxifylline, <b>acetylcysteine,</b> and misoprostol. [...] The evidence {{for all of these}} therapies is based on either case series, {{or in the case of}} pentoxifylline, extrapolated from a subset of patients treated for alcoholic hepatitis.|$|E
2500|$|Acetaminophen (in the US and Japan), {{paracetamol}} (INN), {{also known}} by the brand name Tylenol and Panadol, is usually well tolerated in prescribed dose, but overdose {{is the most common}} cause of drug-induced liver disease and acute liver failure worldwide. [...] Damage to the liver is not due to the drug itself but to a toxic metabolite (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI)) produced by cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the liver. In normal circumstances, this metabolite is detoxified by conjugating with glutathione in phase 2 reaction. In an overdose, a large amount of NAPQI is generated, which overwhelms the detoxification process and leads to liver cell damage. [...] Nitric oxide also plays a role in inducing toxicity. The risk of liver injury is influenced by several factors including the dose ingested, concurrent alcohol or other drug intake, interval between ingestion and antidote, etc. The dose toxic to the liver is quite variable from person to person and is often thought to be lower in chronic alcoholics Measurement of blood level is important in assessing prognosis, higher levels predicting a worse prognosis. Administration of <b>Acetylcysteine,</b> a precursor of glutathione, can limit the severity of the liver damage by capturing the toxic NAPQI. Those that develop acute liver failure can still recover spontaneously, [...] but may require transplantation if poor prognostic signs such as encephalopathy or coagulopathy is present (see King's College Criteria).|$|E
50|$|Although both IV {{and oral}} <b>acetylcysteine</b> are equally {{effective}} for this indication, oral administration is poorly tolerated because high oral doses are required due to low oral bioavailability, {{because of its}} very unpleasant taste and odour, and because of adverse effects, particularly nausea and vomiting. Prior pharmacokinetic studies of <b>acetylcysteine</b> did not consider acetylation {{as a reason for}} the low bioavailability of <b>acetylcysteine.</b> Oral <b>acetylcysteine</b> is identical in bioavailability to cysteine precursors. However, 3% to 6% of people given intravenous <b>acetylcysteine</b> show a severe, anaphylaxis-like allergic reaction, which may include extreme breathing difficulty (due to bronchospasm), a decrease in blood pressure, rash, angioedema, and sometimes also nausea and vomiting. Repeated doses of intravenous <b>acetylcysteine</b> will cause these allergic reactions to progressively worsen in these people.|$|E
50|$|A {{clinical}} trial from 2010, however, found that <b>acetylcysteine</b> is ineffective {{for the prevention}} of contrast-induced nephropathy. This trial, involving 2,308 patients, found that <b>acetylcysteine</b> was no better than a placebo; whether <b>acetylcysteine</b> or the placebo was used, the incidence of nephropathy was the same â€” 13%.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acetylcysteine</b> {{has been}} used for cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis, {{although}} mesna is generally preferred due to the ability of <b>acetylcysteine</b> to diminish the effectiveness of cyclophosphamide.|$|E
