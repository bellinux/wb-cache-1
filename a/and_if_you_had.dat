He was {{highly critical of}} the catalytic converter out of concern for the environmental impact, claiming [...] "In the combustion process this sulfur is rendered into sulfur dioxide, which, as it crosses the platinum in the catalytic converter, becomes sulfur trioxide, which, with the addition of water (another consequence of gasoline combustion), becomes sulfuric acid." [...] Cockburn was also critical of the originator of the Green Revolution concept. In an article in The Nation on Al Gore's 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, Cockburn made the following statement on Norman Borlaug's 1971 Nobel Prize: [...] "Line up some of the more notorious Nobel Peace Prize recipients, such as Kissinger, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to identify the biggest killer of all it was probably Norman Borlaug, one of the architects of the Green Revolution, which unleashed displacement, malnutrition, and death across the Third World." [...] Cockburn had criticized Borlaug previously on this issue.|$|E
