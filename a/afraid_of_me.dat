[...] She said that after she freed herself from his grasp, the young man followed her to the cash register, grabbed her waist and said, [...] "What's the matter baby, can't you take it?" [...] Bryant said she freed herself, and Till said, [...] "You needn't be <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> baby," [...] used [...] "one 'unprintable' word" [...] and said [...] "I've been with white women before." [...] Bryant also alleged that one of Till's companions came into the store, {{grabbed him by the}} arm, and ordered him to leave. According to historian Timothy Tyson, Bryant admitted to him in a 2008 interview that her testimony during the trial that Till had made verbal and physical advances was false.|$|E
2500|$|Fiennes {{stated that}} he had two weeks to shoot the climactic {{showdown}} scene where he is gloating over a terrified Harry, played by Daniel Radcliffe. Fiennes said with a chuckle: [...] "I have no doubt children will be <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> now if they weren't before." [...] In preparation, he read the novel Goblet of Fire, but jokingly conceded: [...] "I was only interested in my scene, and I {{had to go through}} thousands and thousands of other scenes which I did, dutifully, until I got to my scene and I read it many, many, many, many, many times and that was my research." [...] Fiennes reprised his role as Voldemort in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Part 2.|$|E
2500|$|Love and Erlandson {{began writing}} new {{material}} for a second Hole album in 1992, {{in the midst of}} Love's pregnancy with Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. Love's desire to take the band in a more melodic and controlled rock format led bassist Emery to leave the band, and drummer Caroline Rue followed. In an advertisement to find a new bass player, Love wrote: [...] " [...] someone who can play ok, and stand in front of 30,000 people, take off her shirt and have 'fuck you' written on her tits. If you're not <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> and you're not afraid to fucking say it, send a letter. No more pussies, no more fake girls, I want a whore from hell." [...] In April 1992, drummer Patty Schemel was recruited after an audition in Los Angeles, but the band {{spent the rest of the}} year without a consistent bassist.|$|E

2500|$|Haye was due {{to fight}} Manuel Charr at Manchester Arena on 29 June 2013. However, the fight was called off because Haye had {{suffered}} an injury. Haye later arranged a fight with Tyson Fury at the same venue on 28 September 2013. However, {{a week before the}} fight, David Haye sustained a cut to the head which required several stitches, so yet again the fight was postponed. It was originally rescheduled for 8 February 2014. However Haye dropped out of the fight on 17 November 2013 after shoulder surgery. Fury meanwhile, believed that Haye was making excuses because he didn't want the fight, with Fury himself saying [...] "I'm absolutely furious but in all honesty this is exactly what I expected. Everyone knows I was very suspicious when he pulled out the first time and this confirms to me that he's always been <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> and never wanted this fight." [...] Aside from training camp expenses, Haye also cost Fury his positions in the world rankings including an IBF final eliminator bout which would have made him mandatory for a shot at the world title. Although doctors advised Haye to retire from boxing, he never officially announced his retirement.|$|E

It might be worse." ...|$|E

When Wright cools down he'll remember, he'll begin to think, he'll realize that I could more easily have killed him than risk a {{snapshot}} at his arm.

6000|$|... "And you awe not <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me?</b> I don't think that's very flattering, Mr. Fulkerson. You {{ought to}} think Ah'm twahce as awful as papa." ...|$|E
