40|$|Abstract: Head {{injury is}} one of the most common cause of deaths in car-to-pedestrian collisions. To reduce the {{severity}} of such injuries, many international safety committees have performed headform impact test for pedestrian protection. In this paper, an <b>adult</b> <b>headform</b> <b>impactor</b> model is developed based on the finite element (FE) method and validated through the numerical simulation. The skin material of headform impactor is known as polyvinyl chloride skin (PVC) and its material was assumed as viscoelastic. The viscoelastic parameters of headform skin are identified by a series of trial and error methods. The new developed FE <b>adult</b> <b>headform</b> <b>impactor</b> is verified by the drop test and FE JARI adul...|$|E

Ten head impacts between {{pedestrians}} {{and cars}} were reconstructed {{to compare the}} head injuries sustained by pedestrians {{with the results of}} reconstruction tests using the <b>headform</b> <b>impactors</b> designated by the European Enhanced Vehicle-safety Committee (EEVC) Working Group 10 for assessing pedestrian head protection. The methodology of this study included at-scene accident investigation, computer simulation, and physical reconstruction in a laboratory of the head impacts that occurred in the accident cases that were investigated.

40|$|A pop-up hood {{system has}} been {{developed}} to reduce the severity of head injuries to pedestrians in pedestrian-to-automobile accidents. The system employs sensors located on the bumper to detect impact with a pedestrian. If an impact occurs, a signal is sent to an actuator to raise the rear portion of the engine hood approximately 100 mm. This provides a space between the engine and other hard components and the hood, resulting in reduced pedestrian head injuries. Previous studies have mainly employed <b>headform</b> <b>impactors</b> to evaluate the head injury criteria (HIC) values for pop-up hoods. This report describes studies {{of the effect of}} the pop-up hood on injury parameters and kinematics using the POLAR pedestrian dummy. The effectiveness of the pop-up hood system was confirmed by the significant reduction of HIC values in impact tests using the POLAR dummy...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to investigate the effects of pedestrian gait, vehicle-front geometry and impact velocity on the dynamic responses of the head. The multi-body dynamic (MBD) models were used to simulate the head responses in vehicle to pedestrian collisions with different vehicle types in terms of head-impact point measured with Wrap Around Distance (WAD), head relative velocity and impact angle. Furthermore, the distribution of the head contact point on the vehicle fronts is analysed for a comparison of the contact point with the testing areas in the EEVC <b>headform</b> <b>impactor</b> test procedures. A simulation matrix is established using five vehicle types, two mathematical models of the pedestrians represented a 50 th male adult and a 6 -year-old child as well as seven pedestrian gaits based on typical postures in pedestrian accidents. In order to simulate a large range of impact conditions, four vehicle velocities (30 km/h, 40 km/h, 50 km/h and 60 km/h) are considered for each pedestrian position and vehicle type. The results indicated that the pedestrian gait and vehicle-impact velocity strongly influence head-impact condition. It is obvious that due to different vehicle-front geometry, the head-impact velocity, impact angle and head-impact point could be varied as well.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to provide a method to simulate the mechanical behavior of windscreen laminated glass. The polyvinyl butyral (PVB) laminated glass is manufactured by pressing a layer of PVB film in between two pieces of glass plates under the high temperature condition.

Then each windscreen model was impacted with standard <b>adult</b> <b>headform</b> under LS-DYNA environment and the results were compared with the experimental data reported in the literature.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} and optimized {{the performance of}} a reversible hood (RH) for the prevention of the head injuries of an adult pedestrian from car collisions. The FE model of a production car front was introduced and validated. The baseline RH was developed from the original hood in the validated car front model. In order to evaluate the protective performance of the baseline RH, the FE models of an <b>adult</b> <b>headform</b> and a 50 th percentile human head were used in parallel to impact the baseline RH. Based on the evaluation, the response surface method was applied to optimize the RH in terms of the material stiffness, lifting speed, and lifted height. Finally, the headform model and the human head model were again used to evaluate the protective performance of the optimized RH. It was found that the lifted baseline RH can obviously reduce the impact responses of the headform model and the human head model by comparing with the retracted and lifting baseline RH. When the optimized RH was lifted, the HIC values of the headform model and the human head model were further reduced to much lower than 1000.

40|$|Selected new {{vehicles}} are {{tested by the}} Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) to assess their level of pedestrian protection. The draft Global Technical Regulation (GTR) on pedestrian protection specifies a minimum level of protection that must be met {{in order for a}} vehicle design to be approved by regulatory bodies. This GTR may be adopted as an Australian Design Rule under a 1998 UNECE agreement. One possible implication of this is that many vehicles may require significant redesign {{in order to meet the}} GTR requirements. The GTR testing protocol is similar to the ANCAP tests, but differs in some respects. The individual impact tests are conducted under less severe conditions: the impact speed is lower, the child headform mass is higher, and the <b>adult</b> <b>headform</b> mass is slightly lower. This paper examines three {{new vehicles}}, and assesses their likelihood of meeting the requirements of the GTR, based on their ANCAP test results. A method for scaling the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) for different masses and velocities is used to predict GTR performance from a corresponding ANCAP test result. Among the vehicles considered, the areas tested would produce a significantly lower HIC by the GTR test method than by the ANCAP test method. However, on other vehicles there are many locations that were assessed as poor by ANCAP, which are likely to require redesign in order to meet the requirements of the GTR. D. Searson, R. W.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} the injury mechanism of pedestrian chests in collisions with passenger vehicles of various frontal shapes and examining {{the influence of the}} local structural stiffness on the chest injury risk by using the headform impact test at the chest contact area of the vehicle. Three simulations of vehicle to pedestrian collisions were conducted using three validated pedestrian finite element (FE) models of three pedestrian heights of 177 (AM 50 th), 165 and 150 cm and three FE vehicles,models representing a one-box vehicle, a minicar and a medium car. The validity of the vehicle models was evaluated by comparing the headform acceleration against the measured responses from headform impact tests. The chest impact kinematics and the injury mechanisms were analyzed in terms of the distribution of the von Mises stress of the ribcage {{and in terms of the}} chest deflections. The chest contact locations on the front panel and the bonnet top were identified in connection to the causation of rib fractures. The risk of rib fractures was predicted by using the von Mises stress distribution. The headform impact tests were carried out at the chest contact area on the front panel and bonnet to examine the safety performance with respect to pedestrian chest protection. In simulations of the one-box vehicle to pedestrian collisions, the chest was struck directly by the frontal structure at a high velocity and deformed substantially, since a shear force was generated by the stiff windshield frame. The acceleration of the headform was related to the rib deflections. The injury threshold of the ribcage deflection (42 mm) corresponded to the headform average acceleration of 68 G. In the minicar collision, the chest was struck with the bonnet top and cowl area at a low velocity, and the deformation was small due to the distributed contact force between the chest and the bonnet top. Besides, the ribcage deformation was too small for bridging a relation between the headform accelerations and rib deflections. In the medium car collision, the deformation mode of the chest was similar to that in the minicar collision. The chest collided with the bonnet top at a low velocity and deformed uniformly. The deflection of the ribs had an observable correlation with the headform accelerations measured in the headform impact tests. The frontal shape of a vehicle has a large influence on a pedestrian's chest loadings, and the chest deformation depends on the size of the pedestrian and the stiffness of the vehicle. The one-box passenger vehicle causes a high chest injury risk. The <b>headform</b> <b>impactor</b> test can be utilized for the evaluation of the local stiffness of a vehicle's frontal structure. The reduction of the headform acceleration is an effective measure for pedestrian chest protection for specific shapes of vehicles by efficacy in modifying the local structural stiffness...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} and improve {{the performance of a}} newly developed safety system intended to protect pedestrians during frontal car collisions. This system includes a remote sensor system, a contact sensor, a reversible bumper system (RBS), and a reversible hood (RH). The remote sensor system was evaluated for its ability to detect pedestrians at risk in a vehicular traffic environment. In this assessment, car-pedestrian accident scenarios were analyzed based on the cases selected from the Swedish TRaffic Accident Data Acquisition (STRADA) database. The two most common scenarios were identified as cars entering and leaving intersections, and colliding with pedestrians crossing the road. The accident data for these two scenarios were then investigated in terms of specific factors, such as the trajectory and velocity of the pedestrians and cars involved. Based on the accident data, a mathematical model was presented, and the remote pedestrian sensor system was evaluated using this model. The contact sensor was analyzed for the temperature-independent measurement of pedestrian impacts. A baseline bumper finite element (FE) model was initially developed and validated using the European New Car Assessment Program (EuroNCAP) lower legform impact tests performed on the production bumper. Based on the baseline bumper model, an improved bumper model was subsequently developed to meet the acceptance requirements of the European Enhanced Vehicle–safety Committee Working Group 17 (EEVC WG 17) lower legform impact tests. A lower limb FE model was then developed and used to evaluate further the protective performance of the baseline and improved bumper models. Finally, the contact sensor was incorporated into the improved bumper model, and a performance study was conducted to evaluate its performance in terms of temperature stability and mass sensitivity of the sensor output. The performance of the RBS was investigated for the protection of pedestrians’ lower limbs during bumper collisions. The detailed FE model of a production car front was developed and validated based on the EuroNCAP lower legform impact tests performed on the production car front. Next, a model RBS was developed to replace the original bumper in the car front model. In order to investigate the performance of the RBS, the lower limb model and the EEVC WG 17 lower legform model were used to collide with the RBS model of different design configurations under various impact conditions. Finally, the effects of the design parameters on the protective performance of the RBS were calculated using the statistical method for factorial experiment design. The RH was evaluated and optimized for the prevention of head injuries among adult pedestrians from hood collisions. The car front FE model was validated based on the EuroNCAP <b>adult</b> <b>headform</b> impact tests conducted on the car hood. The baseline RH was subsequently developed from the original hood of the validated car front model. The FE models of a 50 th percentile human head and the EEVC WG 17 <b>adult</b> <b>headform</b> were used in parallel to evaluate the protective performance of the baseline RH. In order to minimize the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) values of the headform model, the response surface method was applied to optimize the RH in terms of material stiffness, lifting speed and lifted height. Finally, the headform and human head models were once again used to evaluate the protective performance of the optimized RH. The results of this study indicated that the remote sensor system can detect almost all visible pedestrians in the two most common scenarios in a timely manner when the detection angle is greater than 60 degrees. The contact sensor can also identify pedestrian impacts with the car bumper. Moreover, enhanced sensor output stability and mass sensitivity can be achieved by using a 25 mm rather than 50 mm sensor tube. The RBS performance can be improved by reducing bumper stiffness; however, such performance is impaired in the bumper-deploying process at speeds of 2. 5 m/s or greater. Less than 150 mm, the deployment distance of the RBS has no influence on the bumper protective performance. Compared with the retracted and lifting baseline RH, the lifted baseline RH can definitely minimize the injury parameters of the headform and human head models. When the optimized RH is lifted, the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) values of the headform and human head models are reduced to much lower than 1, 000. Thus, the risk of pedestrian head injuries can be prevented as required by EEVC WG 17...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{analysis}} of predicted injuries to the lower leg and head of pedestrians in vehicle-to-pedestrian collisions through finite element (FE) simulations were analyzed. Today, pedestrian regulatory tests consist of subsystem tests using impactors that are made to hit the vehicle; there is no use of any pedestrian crash test dummy. Hence, the kinematics of the impactors used in the testing procedure can be questioned. An alternative way to assess vehicle-to-pedestrian interaction and injury risks is {{through the use of}} a FE-Human Body Model (HBM). This thesis presents a comparison of injuries predicted by simulated regulatory tests and injuries predicted by a modified Total Human Body Model for Safety (THUMS), with KTH head and neck model, when impacting an advanced FE-model of a sedan passenger car. The injuries in focus are those sustained to the lower extremities, mainly to the knee ligaments and tibia bone fracture, and the head. Further, real-life vehicle-to-pedestrian accidents were reconstructed with the modified THUMS to indicate the power of accident reconstructions using FE simulations. The modified THUMS and the leg impactor did not predict similar risk of leg injuries. THUMS predicted lower ligament elongation and higher tibia bending moments than the impactor. The ligament elongation difference between THUMS and impactor is not comparable. For tibia bending moments, THUMS predicted 18 % higher bending moments than impactor for impact point P 3 and tibia- 2 cross-section for small passenger vehicle-to-pedestrian collision, on average it was 60 % higher for Flex-PLI positioning 75 mm above ground and 42 % higher when Flex-PLI is positioned according to THUMS walking stance. For tibia injury risk as predicted with modified THUMS, vehicle velocity and pedestrian impact location along the width of the energy absorber were significant. Moreover, presence of a femur fracture influenced the tibia bending moment; femure fracture varied as a function of impact location and vehicle velocity. The injuries to the head as predicted by the modified THUMS, with Rigid KTH head and neck model, and <b>headform</b> <b>impactor</b> were found to have similar head impact kinematics with similar head impact duration and behavior of acceleration curve. Predicted head injuries, using the injury measures HIC 15 and BRIC, were influenced by the head impact location on the vehicle, vehicle height in relation to THUMS and vehicle velocity. In the accident reconstructions modified THUMS model predicted high HIC 15 values, representing high risk of head injuries as compared to the head injury reported in the two cases that were reconstructed. The difference is qualitative only, no quantitative difference conclusion can be drawn from the results. This deviation in results could be explained due to the fact of non-availability of head impact locations in the database cases, not including the vehicle deceleration which may be present during actual accident and non-inclusion of road and weather conditions.

40|$|Consumer and {{regulatory}} tests for improvement in pedestrian protection are now firmly established.

40|$|In 1996, the European Enhanced Vehicle Safety Committee, Working Group 17 (EEVC WG 17) {{proposed}} -a set {{of impact}} procedures {{to evaluate the}} pedestrian injury risk of vehicle fronts. These procedures address three aspects of pedestrian protection -head impacts, lower limb impacts, and thigh impacts -through vehicle subsystem tests.

One of the challenges to vehicle design introduced by these tests is the impact of an <b>adult</b> pedestrian <b>headform</b> {{to the top of the}} fender. The proposed acceptance level for Head Injury Criterion (HIC) is less than 1000 during impacts at 40 kmlh. This paper uses the finite element (FE) method to predict the influence of proposed fender and shotgun design modifications aimed at meeting this target. In addition, the known issues with the implementation of these proposed changes are discussed. Although the proposed changes are shown to meet the target in the theoretical analyses presented in this paper, these changes are also demonstrated to conflict with other aspects of vehicle safety (frontal visibility and frontal high-speed impact), vehicle manufacturing, and durability...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} head impact dynamics and to establish risk functions for head injuries by mathematical reconstructions of real-world car-to-pedestrian accidents. Furthermore, an attempt was made to develop an approach for the design and evaluation of head-protective devices. Child and adult pedestrian accidents from the German In-Depth Accident Study (GIDAS) database were analyzed and selected for reconstruction. These accident cases contained detailed information concerning the car, pedestrian and environment in the pre-crash, crash and post-crash phases. Two approaches, multibody system (MBS) dynamics, implemented by the MADYMO program; and the finite element method (FEM), implemented by the LS-DYNA program, were used for this study. The child pedestrian accidents were reconstructed using corresponding MBS pedestrian and car models. The GEBOD program was used to generate the mass/inertial properties and characteristic dimensions of various body segments, based upon anthropometric data of the victims. The MBS car models were developed according to the geometry of the cars involved in the accidents. The contact properties of the car structures were obtained from impactor tests. Initial conditions in the reconstruction, such as car impact speed, pedestrian position and posture, were set up according to accident information. The adult pedestrian accidents were first reconstructed using the MBS approach to reproduce pedestrian kinematics. A validated finite element (FE) head model with detailed anatomy structure was then used to reconstruct the head-to-windshield impacts. The initial impact conditions – including head impact velocity, head impact location, and head orientation – were defined according to the results from the MBS reconstructions. Brain injury parameters, such as intracranial stress and pressure, were calculated and correlated with the injury outcomes using a logistic regression model. An FE dummy model was developed as a substitute for a mechanical pedestrian dummy, and was validated on both component and full-scale levels across an extensive range of tests. The FE dummy model was used for the design and optimization of a pedestrian airbag system. The accident analysis demonstrated that the head was the most vulnerable body region in pedestrian accidents. Its injury severity depends on car impact speed and head impact location. In child pedestrian accidents, head impact locations were mainly on the hood top. In adult pedestrian accidents, the MAIS 2 head injuries were frequently caused by impacts with the windshield centre, while impacts with the windshield edge and A-pillar were associated with a higher risk of AIS 3 + head injuries. The accident reconstructions using MBS models showed that head impact conditions depend on the shape and stiffness of the car front, car impact speed, and pedestrian stature. In general, the head impact speed is proportional to the car impact speed and is lower than the maximum head speed. The head impact angle could be influenced by several factors, such as pedestrian height, hood edge height, hood angle and car impact speed. The head impact timing increases as a function of pedestrian height and is inversely proportional to car impact speed. The HIC is an important criterion in predicting head injury risk in pedestrian accidents, with a tolerance level that could vary considerably among individuals. At a HIC value of 700, the corresponding AIS 2 + head injury risk of a child pedestrian varies between 40 % and 68 %. The calculated brain injury parameters using the FE head model show a good correlation with brain injury severity. Critical values of the parameters were determined for AIS 3 + brain injuries, which are 256 kPa of coup pressure, 152 kPa of countercoup pressure, 14. 8 kPa of Von Mises stress, and 7. 9 kPa of shear stress. Compared with <b>headform</b> <b>impactors,</b> a pedestrian dummy could render a more biofidelic response as to head impact kinematics. The optimized airbag system could reduce the HIC value of the FE dummy head from 2, 960 to 602 at the car impact speed of 40 km/h. The results also indicate that the protection performance could be influenced by design parameters such as ignition timing and the presence of a vent hole on the airbag. This study demonstrates that accident reconstructions could help to promote knowledge of head injury mechanisms in pedestrian accidents. This knowledge could be utilized, with proper mathematical tools such as the FE pedestrian dummy model, to develop safety countermeasures and thereby enhance pedestrian head protection...|$|R
