40|$|Background: Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a {{dermatosis}} {{characterized by}} thickened, hyperpigmented plaques, typically on the intertriginous surfaces and neck. Common in some populations, its prevalence depends on race. Clinicians should recognize AN; it heralds disorders ranging from endocrinologic disturbances to malignancy. In this review, {{we discuss the}} pathogenesis of AN and its clinical implications and management. Materials and Methods: We selected 30 patients for the study. Diagnosis of associated disorders was established by history, physical examination, body mass index (BMI), hormone measurements by radioimmunoassays of thyroidnfunction tests, free testosterone, 17 (OH) progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), cortisol, gonadotropins, prolactin, immunoreactive insulin, and C-peptide levels. Results and Discussion: In our study, the flexural involvement (flexures of groins, knees and elbows) <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 40 % patients, lip involvement <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 6. 6 % patients, and dorsal involvement <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 3. 3 % patients each. Increased serum testosterone levels <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 13. 3 % patients and increased DHEAS levels <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 20 % patients. Regarding the types of AN, obesity induced AN or pseudo-AN <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> 70 % patients, syndromic AN <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 23. 35 % patients and malignant AN <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 6. 6 % patients. The commonest histopathological feature of patients with AN <b>was</b> hyperkeratosis, <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 100 % patients, papillomatosis <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 90 % patients, dermal infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 60 % patients, horn pseudocysts <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 30 % patients, and irregular acanthosis <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 26. 6 % patients...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Cicatrical {{alopecia}} {{occurs in}} otherwise healthy {{men and women}} of all ages and <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> worldwide Material and Methods: A study of 40 patients was conducted to study the clinical variants and histopathology of cicatricial alopecia. Results and Discussion: n our study, it <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> that maximum number of cases of cicatrical alopecia were of LPP (27. 5 %) followed by 25 % of DLE, 20 % patients had pseudopelade of Brocq, SLE <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 5 % cases followed by Scleroderma, dermatomyositis, Keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans, aplasia cutis, kerion, follicular mucinosis, pemphigus, dissecting cellulitis of scalp/ pyogenic folliculitis and acne keloidalis nuchae in 2. 5 % cases each. Regarding the morphology of lesions,epidermal atrophy <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 90 % patients, erythema <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 55 % cases, follicular pluging <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 40 % patients, telangiectasias in 27. 5 % patients, diffuse scaling in 25 % patients and mottled hyperpigmentation <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 20 % patients. In our study, commonest histopathological feature of alopecia <b>was</b> perifollicular fibrosis <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 65 % patients, basal cell vacuolization <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 52. 5 % patients,perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 50 % patients, epidermal atrophy <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 35 % patients and hyperkeratosis <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 20 % patients...|$|R
5|$|Adrenal {{tumors are}} {{commonly}} found as incidentalomas, unexpected asymptomatic tumors found during medical imaging. They <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> around 3.4% of CT scans, {{and in most}} cases they are benign adenomas. Adrenal carcinomas are very rare, with an incidence of 1 case per million per year.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{differences}} in morphology and development <b>are</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>In</b> the desert locust and the migratory locust, for example, the gregaria nymphs become darker with strongly contrasting yellow and black markings, they grow larger, and have longer developmental periods. The adults are larger with different body proportions, less sexual dimorphism, and higher metabolic rates. They mature more rapidly and start reproducing earlier, but have {{lower levels of}} fecundity.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 85% of {{individuals}} with this disorder have not been diagnosed and consequently are not receiving lipid-lowering treatments. Physical examination findings can help a physician make the diagnosis of FH. Tendon xanthomas <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 20-40% {{of individuals}} with FH and are pathognomonic for the condition. A xanthelasma or corneal arcus may also be seen. These common signs are supportive of the diagnosis, but are non-specific findings.|$|E

5|$|As a {{technology}} showcase, Valve considered Lost Coast {{to have very}} demanding system requirements. The game runs on computers with specifications lower than what is recommended, albeit without some key features such as high dynamic range. If a non-high-dynamic-range-capable card is used, the developer commentary is changed slightly to reflect this. For example, Valve president Gabe Newell would describe the effects that <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> a different manner.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} {{evolution}} of new metabolic pathways, evolution can also cause the loss of metabolic functions. For example, in some parasites metabolic processes that are not essential for survival are lost and preformed amino acids, nucleotides and carbohydrates may instead be scavenged from the host. Similar reduced metabolic capabilities <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> endosymbiotic organisms.|$|E

5|$|Body {{impressions}} of Early Carboniferous temnospondyls from Pennsylvania {{suggest that some}} terrestrial temnospondyls mated on land like some modern amphibians.

The head of one individual rests under the tail of another {{in what may be}} a courtship display. Internal fertilization and similar courtship behavior <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> modern salamanders.|$|E
