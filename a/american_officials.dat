5|$|Although <b>American</b> <b>officials</b> at {{the highest}} levels of the {{intelligence}} community (e.g. CIA Director William Colby) were certain that the South Vietnamese government would collapse, everyone in the U.S. government underestimated the speed of the North Vietnamese advance during the 1975 Spring Offensive and how quickly South Vietnam's Army would collapse.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} American men with {{political}} ambitions {{fought in the}} Black Hawk War. At least seven future U.S. Senators took part, as did four future Illinois governors; future governors of Michigan, Nebraska, and the Wisconsin Territory; and one future U.S. president. The Black Hawk War demonstrated to <b>American</b> <b>officials</b> the need for mounted troops to fight a mounted foe. During the war, the U.S. Army did not have cavalry; the only mounted soldiers were part-time volunteers. After the war, Congress created the Mounted Ranger Battalion {{under the command of}} Henry Dodge, which was expanded to the 1st Cavalry Regiment in 1833.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} Quebec Agreement was signed, Akers had already cabled London with {{instructions}} that Chadwick, Peierls, Oliphant and Francis Simon should leave immediately for North America. They arrived on 19 August, {{the day it}} was signed, expecting {{to be able to talk}} to American scientists, but were unable to do so. Two weeks would pass before <b>American</b> <b>officials</b> learnt of the contents of the Quebec Agreement. Over the next two years, the Combined Policy Committee met only eight times.|$|E
5|$|In 1830, {{violence}} {{threatened to}} undo American attempts at preventing intertribal warfare. In May, Dakotas (Santee Sioux) and Menominees killed fifteen Meskwakis attending a treaty conference at Prairie du Chien. In retaliation, {{a party of}} Meskwakis and Sauks killed twenty-six Menominees, including women and children, at Prairie du Chien in July 1831. <b>American</b> <b>officials</b> discouraged the Menominees from seeking revenge, but the western bands of the tribe formed a coalition with the Dakotas to strike at the Sauks and Meskwakis.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942, the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project from OSRD, and Groves became the project's director. He {{tightened}} security, which dried up {{the flow of information}} to Britain. <b>American</b> <b>officials</b> were particularly concerned that Akers and other people from ICI involved in the Tube Alloys project were trying to exploit American nuclear scientific knowledge to create a profitable post-war industry. In October 1942, Bush and Conant convinced Roosevelt that the United States should independently develop the atomic bomb project, despite an agreement of unrestricted scientific interchange between the US and Britain.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, <b>American</b> <b>officials</b> {{scrambled}} to mobilize troops. Cass hurried to Prairie du Chien, where he organized the local militia. Colonel Snelling arrived at Prairie du Chien on July 10, bringing about 200 regulars from Fort Snelling to reoccupy Fort Crawford. He was joined there on July 29 by Brigadier General Henry Atkinson, who brought 500 men upriver by steamboat from Jefferson Barracks. Several days later, Henry Dodge arrived at Fort Crawford with 130 mounted militiamen, mostly miners. Governor Ninian Edwards of Illinois sent 600 mounted militiamen north to Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|Most Native Americans in {{the region}} decided against joining the uprising, and so the {{conflict}} ended after U.S. officials responded with a show of military force. Ho-Chunk chiefs surrendered eight men {{who had participated in}} the violence, including Red Bird, who <b>American</b> <b>officials</b> believed to be the ringleader. Red Bird died in prison in 1828 while awaiting trial; two other men convicted of murder were pardoned by President John Quincy Adams and released.|$|E
5|$|Several {{villages of}} Christian Delawares lay between the combatants on the Sandusky River and the Americans at Fort Pitt. The villages were {{administered}} by the Moravian missionaries David Zeisberger and John Heckewelder. Although pacifists, the missionaries favored the American cause and kept <b>American</b> <b>officials</b> at Fort Pitt informed about hostile British and Indian activity. In September 1781, to prevent further communication between the missionaries and the American military, hostile Wyandots and Delawares from Sandusky forcibly removed the missionaries and their converts to a new village (Captive Town) on the Sandusky River.|$|E

5|$|Thanks to the {{decision}} of Potawatomi leaders to aid the U.S. during the war, <b>American</b> <b>officials</b> did not seize tribal land as war reparations. Instead, only three individuals accused of leading the Indian Creek massacre were tried in court; they were acquitted. Nevertheless, the drive to purchase Potawatomi land west of the Mississippi began in October 1832, when commissioners in Indiana bought {{a large amount of}} Potawatomi land, even though not all Potawatomi bands were represented at the treaty. The tribe was compelled to sell their remaining land west of the Mississippi in a treaty held in Chicago in September 1833.|$|E
5|$|The officers' reports also commended Porter, {{stating that}} he had saved Experiment and her convoy by acting on his own {{initiative}} to ignore Maley's defeatism, urging the crew to fight. Other <b>American</b> <b>officials,</b> such as the American consul at Leonge who was aboard the Experiment during the action, disagreed with Porter's accusations and instead lauded Maley for his bravery. Threats of court-martial were made against Maley, but no formal charges regarding the incident were ever brought. On 16 July 1800 he was replaced as commander of Experiment by Charles Stewart. The incident haunted his career until his retirement.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Bad Axe, Black Hawk, Wabokieshiek, {{and their}} {{followers}} traveled northeast to seek refuge with the Ojibwes. <b>American</b> <b>officials</b> offered a reward of $100 and forty horses for Black Hawk's capture. While camping near present-day Tomah, Wisconsin, Black Hawk's party {{was seen by}} a passing Ho-Chunk man, who alerted his village chief. The village council sent a delegation to Black Hawk's camp and convinced him to surrender to the Americans. On August 27, 1832, Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek surrendered at Prairie du Chien to Indian agent Joseph Street. Colonel Zachary Taylor took custody of the prisoners, and sent them by steamboat to Jefferson Barracks, escorted by Lieutenants Jefferson Davis and Robert Anderson.|$|E

5|$|Duc had {{years of}} {{experience}} in France, which had given him a good feel of how the French might be thinking and what their relations with Francophile members of the ARVN might resemble. He used this to concoct some plausible sounding and incriminating documents for Mậu. They purported to show that three prominent members of the junta: Generals Minh, Kim and Don had been bought by French agents and were on the brink of declaring South Vietnam's neutrality and signing a peace deal to end the war with the North.

5|$|Hoping {{to prevent}} the {{outbreak}} of a wider war, <b>American</b> <b>officials</b> ordered the U.S. Army to arrest the Meskwakis who massacred the Menominees. General Gaines was ill, and so his subordinate, Brigadier General Henry Atkinson, received the assignment. Atkinson was a middle-aged officer who had ably handled administrative and diplomatic tasks, most notably during the 1827 Winnebago War, {{but he had never}} seen combat. On April 8, he set out from Jefferson Barracks in Missouri, moving up the Mississippi River by steamboat with about 220 soldiers. By chance, Black Hawk and his British Band had just crossed into Illinois. Although Atkinson did not realize it, his boats passed Black Hawk's band.|$|E

Lorković also sought foreign contacts and through Switzerland made contact with British and <b>American</b> <b>officials,</b> but was rebuffed. He proposed that the NDH end its relations with Germany and join the Allies, a proposal supported by the Minister of the Armed Forces, Ante Vokić, as well as many high-ranking Croatian Home Guard officers and politicians.

5|$|In the meantime, Thảo's main partner Phát headed towards Tan Son Nhut Air Base — the country's {{military}} headquarters — {{to capture}} {{it with an}} assortment of marines, paratroopers and special forces troops.

The plotters had secured the cooperation of someone working inside the Joint General Staff headquarters. This collaborator was supposed to have closed the gate so Khánh would be held up, but left them open. Some of the other senior officers in the Armed Forces Council were not so lucky, and were caught by Phát's troops inside headquarters, while other buildings in the complex remained under junta control.|$|E
5|$|Leftover waters {{from the}} storm led to an {{increase}} in mosquitoes in Texas, which prompted a widespread application of larvicide via airplane.
