40|$|Various {{anatomical}} {{factors were}} examined which might provide passive resistance to portal venous flow and so cause portal hypertension. Methods included {{the measurement of}} portal pressure (WHVPG) in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients, morphological assessment by semiquantitative grading of severity of disease, calculation of hepatocyte size indices, and assessment of volume density of hepatocytes, sinusoids, <b>Disse's</b> space <b>and</b> <b>Disse's</b> space collagen by electron microscopy. The wedged hepatic venous pressure gradient increased with progression of disease and portal hypertension was present before histologically detectable cirrhosis had developed. With increasing progression of disease towards cirrhosis, the relationship between individual and aggregated features and the WHVPG diminished and lost statistical significance. Hepatocyte size increased with progression of histological changes and correlated significantly with increase of WHVPG, both in non-alcoholic <b>and</b> alcoholic patients. <b>Disse's</b> space collagen was increased significantly in non-alcoholic chronic active hepatitis compared with patients with near-normal liver. No significant decrease of sinusoidal space was found. Multiple factors rather than any single feature influence the development of portal hypertension...|$|R

40|$|Phalloidin, a toxin {{from the}} plant Amanita phalloides, irreversibly polymerizes actin {{filaments}} and causes cholestasis. Three-dimensional structural changes induced by phalloidin in the bile canaliculi and the intra-acinar localization of these changes were studied in the rat liver by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. After 3 days of treatment, canalicular changes appeared mainly in zones 2 and 3 of Rappaport's acinus, but after 7 days of treatment changes occurred in bile canaliculi of the whole acinus. The changes in the bile canaliculi included tortuosity, saccular dilatation, loss of microvilli, bleb formation and elongation of canalicular side branches. Some side branches extended near to Disse's space, leaving only a thin cytoplasmic rim between the canalicular lumen <b>and</b> <b>Disse's</b> space. Kupffer cells were occasionally situated near such extended bile canaliculi and protruded their processes into the hepatic cord. These results suggest that bile canaliculi in zone 3 {{are more susceptible to}} phalloidin toxicity than those in zone 1 and that biliary constituents may leak from such altered bile canaliculi. </p...|$|R

The model was developed through a six step Research and Development (R & D) namely: 1) a preliminary study; 2) product planning and development; 3) product validation and testing; 4) analysis and revision; 5) field test and revision; 6) products implementation <b>and</b> <b>disse</b> mination. KMPHD -K model was validated, tested and revised {{and therefore it}} is good and fit. This model was applied to evaluate the implementation of MPMBS in high school. The data was collected through observation, interview, FGD, document search and ques tionnaire, and was analyzed descriptively by using LISREL 8. 8 (CFA and SEM) program. Context variable, input and implementation process positively and significantly support the program. KMPHD -K is fit based on Chi -Square Value (263, 65), p value 0. 51179 (≥ 0. 05), RMSEA 0. 0000 ( 0. 78 with extract construct variant almost ≥ 0. 50. The relationship among signific ant variables (t ≥ 1. 96), the measurement and structural model is fit, the influence between variables is significant (t ≥ 1, 96). Therefore, the implementation model of KMPHD -K in High schools is significantly accepted, although the needs analysis shows tha t the related components such as classroom teaching process, ICT application, and other infra structures {{still need to be}} improved. This research shows that KMPHD -K model is effective to evaluate the implementation of MPMBS in SMAs as well as in SMKs. Keywords: KMPHD -K application model.

40|$|The ultrastructural changes {{produced}} in the rat liver following intraperitoneal injection of a single close of endotoxin were studied for 24 hours. Perfusion fixation was used for suitable preservation of the ultrastructure of the liver, especially that of the sinusoids. During the first 3 hours after the administration of endotoxin, hepatocytes showed a loss of glycogen accompanied by an increased prominence of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, swelling of mitochondria, disorganization of rough endoplasmic reticulum {{and an increase in}} numbers of lysosomes and lipid droplets. These changes were similar to those seen in saline injected animals and considered to be nonspecific alterations elicited by stress. In the sinusoids there was an aggregation of leukocytes, platelets and erythrocytes at 1 hour. In addition, at later intervals a considerable amount of fibrin was found. At 4 hours hepatocytes showed a marked vacuolation and these vacuoles were bounded by a single membrane and occasionally contained fibrillar materials. Necroses of hepatocytes were seen in the periportal area. In the sinusoids there were large numbers of thrombi. Endothelial cells around the thrombi showed desquamation and fragmentation and the space of Disse was markedly distended with appearance of erythrocytes. By 24 hours these changes appeared less prominent. The characteristic change in hepatocytes at this interval was an increase in numbers of very low density lipoprotein granules in the Golgi vesicles, endoplasmic reticulum <b>and</b> <b>Disse's</b> space <b>and</b> was thought to he a finding indicating recovery from the inhibition of protein synthesis. It is concluded that thrombi formation by endotoxin {{plays an important role in}} the initation of hepatocellular necrosis...|$|R

Within the extra-hepato cyte environment of focal tissue, the mean volume occupied by Ito cells was markedly decreased, whilst that occupied by endothelial and Kupffer cells was increased, when compared to uninvolved tissue from the same rat livers. The bile canalicull were dilated, but nosignificant differences in the mean volume occupkd by the sinusoidal <b>and</b> <b>Disse</b> spaces were noted. In focal hepatocytes there was a striking overproduction of lipid droplets and proliferation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (sER). Whorls of concentrically arranged, parallel ER membranes were found only in the hepatocytes of preneoplastic foci, {{in association with the}} proliferated sER, and never in the surrounding, uninvolved tissue. The Increase In mean volume of the sER, lipid droplet and cytoplasmic matrix compartments, together with the appearance of whorls, were the major contributing factors to the marked hypertrophy seen in focal hepatocytes. The mean volume of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial, lysosomal, peroxisomal and nuclear compartments per hepatocyte also Increased, but contributed to a lesser extent to the cellular hypertrophy. It is speculated that whorls may be structural adaptations, resulting from a possible alteration in the normalfeedback control of cholesterol synthesis, for the production of sterols and the biogenesis of sER in eosinophilic-type focal cells. The significance of changes observed in focal tissue, and the high biological variation noted between foci, is discussed in relation to the hepatocarcinogenic proces...|$|R
40|$|Background: Few {{clinical}} {{data are}} available regarding the effect of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) on liver microcirculation and fibrosis. This randomized, controlled trial is to investigate the ef-fect of Ginko biloba extract EGb 761 on liver fibrosis and hepatic microcirculation in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Methods: Sixty-four patients with chronic hepatitis B were ran-domized for intention-to-treat. Thirty-two patients were assigned to treated group receiving EGb 761 plus polyunsaturated phosphati-dylcholine (Essentiale), 32 patients received Essentiale as controls. Blood samples were taken for measurement of transforming growth factor beta- 1 (TGF-β 1), platelet activate factor (PAF), endothelin 1 (ET- 1). Twenty-six patients in treated group and 21 patients in control group underwent liver biopsies for histology before and af-ter treatment. Ultrastructural study for sinusoidal microcirculation before and after treatment was carried out on 10 randomly selected patients in each group. Results: In the treated group, after EGb 761 treatment, {{there was a significant}} reduction of blood TGF- β 1, PAF and ET- 1 (p < 0. 05), whereas this was not observed in the controls. After treatment in both groups, there were significant decrease of ALT, TBil and PT (p < 0. 05), and significant increase of ALB (p < 0. 05). Hepatic inflam-mation and fibrosis significantly alleviated in the treated group, but not in the controls. After EGb 761 treatment, electron microscopy showed red blood cell aggregates and microthrombosis disappeared or decreased in sinusoids; collagen deposits in sinusoidal lumen <b>and</b> <b>Disse</b> space reduced; sinusoidal capillarization alleviated. Conclusions: EGb 761 can improve sinusoidal microcirculation, alleviate inflammation and inhibit fibrosis through multiple mecha-nisms, it is effective in the treatment of chronic liver diseases...|$|R
