Like the song, it incorporated Hispanic culture and portrayed her dressed in Spanish style as <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> in search of a treasure. Madonna has performed the song on her Who's That Girl World Tour (1987) and on the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–2016). The song has been covered by many artists and has appeared in compilations and tribute albums.|$|E
5|$|Trollope has {{described}} {{again and again}} the ravages of love... His story is always primarily a love-story, and a love-story constructed on an inveterate system.

25|$|Geoffrey Chaucer wrote a Canterbury {{tale about}} <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady,</b> Constance, who alone survives a {{massacre}} {{only to be}} put into an open boat and set adrift upon the sea. Chaucer told this story as the Man of Law's Tale in the late-14th century, and his tale of the setting-adrift of Constance in an open boat derives from an earlier, Latin version. The Middle English Breton lai Emaré also incorporates this element in its plot. Just like Constance, and just like Christabel in this tale of Sir Eglamour of Artois, Emaré narrowly survives death and is put instead into a boat which takes her to a distant land and a new life.|$|E

In 1991, <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> named Blair Daimler (Mia Korf, Kassie DePaiva from 1993 onward) arrives in town and marries Asa Buchanan (Philip Carey).

Addie had been Dorian's presumed dead sister. Dorian did not know that Addie was alive or that she had a niece, Blair. Dorian battled other problems in the early 1990s, such as a breast cancer scare.|$|E

25|$|Lawson in the 1890s {{records that}} <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> once {{fell over the}} cliff near Craig Na'an; however, her Victorian style {{garments}} caught the wind like a parachute and she escaped with her life and some broken bones that soon knit back together. A visitor in a group from Stranraer was not so lucky and fell to his death on his way down from the summit. A shocking death {{was that of a}} lad from Girvan who was sitting amongst loose rocks, pulling out stones and throwing them into the sea when a very large boulder started to move and crushed him. The stone was too heavy to shift and help from the mainland was required to extract the body of the unfortunate victim. In 1887 a ten-year-old boy died whilst collecting eggs at the West Craigs.|$|E

He meets up with the Light Maiden Shigure, <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> whose village was destroyed by the Kimon clan and whom Jubei was charged with delivering a Dragon Stone to. The duo are joined by Tsubute (a young thief) and Dakuan (Tokugawa shogunate spy), and together they try to find out why both the Kimon and the Hiruko clan are after her and why the Dragon Stone she carries is so important to them. The show was directed by Tatsuo Sato (Martian Successor Nadesico), with character design done by Takahiro Yoshimatsu (Trigun).|$|E

She lived for almost 10 {{years in the}} city with Edith and wealthy Aunt Shaw {{to learn to be}} <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady.</b> Margaret has refused an offer of marriage from the captain's brother, Henry, an up-and-comng barrister. Her life is turned upside down when her father, the local pastor, leaves the Church of England and the rectory of Helstone as a matter of conscience; his intellectual honesty has made him a dissenter. At the suggestion of Mr. Bell, his old friend from Oxford, he settles with his wife and daughter in Milton-Northern (where Mr. Bell was born and owns property).

25|$|Poirot {{is asked}} for {{assistance}} by <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady,</b> Diana Maberly. She {{was engaged to}} marry Hugh Chandler {{for over a year}} but he has broken it off as he thinks he is going mad. There is a history of insanity in the family, with his grandfather and a great aunt being afflicted, and his father, Admiral Chandler, has insisted his son leave the Navy before his condition gets worse but the reason was hidden under the pretext of having to manage the family country estate – a reason no one believed, including Colonel Frobisher, a family friend and Hugh's godfather. At Poirot's prompting, Diana admits that there have been some unusual occurrences on nearby farms with the throats of sheep cut and the like but insists {{it has nothing to do}} with the situation.

25|$|The film {{opens with}} images of <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> being raped by a {{seemingly}} unknown man. Inspector Danladi Waziri (Sadiq Daba) is summoned by the British colonial military to present a draft of his findings on the series of virgin killings that has occurred in Akote. The film flashes back, as Inspector Waziri narrates his story on his observations and experience from his arrival {{in the town of}} Akote; he is warmly received by Sergeant Afonja (Kayode Aderupoko). On arriving the village square, Danladi notices the villagers celebrating a horse-rider, who is later noted by Afonja to be Prince Aderopo (Demola Adedoyin). He just returned from the city, as the first university graduate in the community. Danladi observes physical and circumstantial similarities in the deceased virgins, and deduces it must be serial killing. Danladi and Afonja continue in their investigations; the officers interrogate Agbekoya (Kunle Afolayan), who is the owner of the farm where the last lady was killed. Agbekoya denies any knowledge of the events that led to the killings and is subsequently freed by the inspector Waziri due to a perceived language barrier between them.|$|E
25|$|Tulkinghorn is murdered, with no {{shortage}} of suspects. Lady Dedlock is implicated, but Inspector Bucket reveals that her former maid Hortense is the murderess and had tried to frame Lady Dedlock. Richard and Ada are secretly married, but he is obsessed with the lawsuit, encouraged by John's unscrupulous friend Harold Skimpole and the conniving lawyer Vholes. As a result, Richard is penniless and his health is failing. Hawdon's letters — written by <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>Lady</b> Dedlock and revealing her secret — find their {{way back into the}} hands of the moneylender Smallweed, who sells them to Sir Leicester. Guilty over her deception and not wanting to bring ruin to her husband, Lady Dedlock flees into a storm before Sir Leicester is able to tell her he does not care about her past. He has a massive heart attack but sends Bucket after her. Bucket eventually realizes where she must be — the graveyard where Hawdon is buried — but Esther arrives to find her mother dead from exposure. A final Jarndyce will is found that closes the case in favor of Richard and Ada, but the estate has been consumed by years of legal fees. Richard collapses, overcome by tuberculosis, and soon dies. Allan professes his love for Esther, who rebuffs him out of obligation to John, and a pregnant Ada returns to Bleak House. John releases Esther from their engagement, knowing that she really loves Allan. Esther and Allan marry, with all in attendance.|$|E
