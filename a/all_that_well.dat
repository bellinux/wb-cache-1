The Australian franchise the Western Force only managed one victory and ended winning the wooden spoon as last placed 14th. The highlight for the Force was a 23-all draw against eventual champions the Crusaders, who defeated first-time finalists the Hurricanes 19–12.|$|E

He also {{considered}} the farm plotline to be pointless and aimless, especially due to it airing {{in the last few}} episodes of the series.|$|E

500|$|More than a {{thousand}} young actresses were considered for the part of Max. Cameron started reviewing audition tapes when the field had been narrowed down to twenty or thirty applicants. He was initially not impressed with Alba's audition tape, saying [...] "she had her head down, she was reading out of the script... she didn't present herself <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>well.</b> But {{there was something about}} the way she read the script that copped an attitude that I liked." [...] Cameron continually reviewed the audition tapes but kept coming back to Alba's, eventually deciding that he needed to meet her. Alba was hired for the role before the script was written. Eglee said: [...] "We had the benefit of being able to write a script kind of backwards, we were writing for this actress, with her cadences and her rhythms and her sensibilities and her attitude and her slang." [...] To train for the role, Alba spent a year doing martial arts and gymnastics and riding motorcycles.|$|E

[...] Kim Voynar of TV Squad gave the episode a mixed review, saying [...] " [...] {{it just seemed}} to wrap up a little too quickly for me, like {{they ran out of}} time and were like, 'Oops, let's wrap this up now'. Other than that quibble, though, it was a fairly funny episode." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number five on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "one of the best episodes ever" [...] for fans of offensive humor. He also noted that the episode did not [...] "go down <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>well</b> at the time with censors and charity groups." ...|$|E
500|$|After Sill let Bettis and Lind {{know that}} Madonna was singing the song, some time elapsed before {{either of them}} heard {{anything}} from Warner Bros. Records. In between, they {{went to one of}} the recording sessions and were not impressed with the process of recording the song. Bettis commented, [...] "We went to one of the sessions, and to be honest, that particular session did not go <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>well.</b> [...] Jon and I were depressed about the way the song had come out. We heard nothing else about it and we were a little nervous that the song was going to be dropped from the picture." [...] Bettis went to England to work on the 1985 fantasy film Legend with music producer Jerry Goldsmith. It was there he received a call from Lind, who informed Bettis that a new version of [...] "Crazy for You" [...] was recorded and was made ready for a single release. Bettis was surprised and went over to Lind's house, where he warmly received the new recorded version of the song. It had a different arrangement from the demo version, and the arrangement was done by composer Rob Mounsey who rearranged the original track and added the background vocals. Bettis said: [...] "We owe a big debt of gratitude to [...] He really made a hit record out of [...]" [...] Mounsey was introduced in the project by record producer John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez who was producing [...] "Crazy for You". Benitez was previously associated with producing dance-pop themed songs {{and it was the first}} time that he produced a ballad.

2500|$|To Barson, however, Huston {{was among}} the [...] "least consistent" [...] filmmakers, {{although}} he concludes {{that he was one}} of the [...] "most interesting directors of the past sixty years". Throughout his long career, many of his films did poorly and were criticized as a result. To a writer in 1972 he commented, [...] "Criticism isn't a new experience for me. Pictures that are now thought of as, forgive the term, classics, weren't <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>well</b> thought of at the time they came out." [...] After an interview a few years before he died, the reporter writes that [...] "Huston said he missed the major studio era when people savored making movies, not just money." ...|$|E

What {{are we going to}} do with these students, where are they going to sit in the sun and <b>all</b> <b>that?</b> <b>Well,</b> we decided, it's got to be cloisters. All of the buildings have got to touch at the ground. We then devised this system and it had an absolutely firm principle: it had a great spine down the middle where everybody walked. That led everywhere. The cars were on the outside, on both sides. When you came into the spaces things were square, they were rectangular courtyards and they were all slightly different. There were two or three essentials: one was that the covered way had to be continuous, the buildings had to be three or four storeys high and connecting to the next one. I thought it worked very well." ...|$|E
2500|$|A few {{critics were}} less than {{impressed}} by King's victory; she was 26 years younger, and some experts claimed {{that it was more}} an age versus youth game. According to Jack Kramer, [...] "I don't think Billie Jean played <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>well.</b> She hit a lot of short balls which Bobby could have taken advantage of had he been in shape. I would never take anything away from Billie Jean—because she was smart enough to prepare herself properly—but it might have been different if Riggs hadn't kept running around. It was more than one woman who took care of Bobby Riggs in Houston." [...] Before the match, however, King had forced the American television network ABC to drop Kramer as a commentator. King said, [...] "He doesn't believe in women's tennis. Why should he be part of this match? He doesn't believe in half of the match. I'm not playing. Either he goes—or I go." ...|$|E

2500|$|Once Kennedy won the nomination, Stevenson, {{always an}} {{enormously}} popular public speaker, campaigned actively for him. Due to his two presidential nominations and previous United Nations experience, Stevenson perceived himself an elder statesman {{and the natural}} choice for Secretary of State. However, according to historian Robert Dallek, [...] "neither Jack nor Bobby [...] thought <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>well</b> of Stevenson...they saw him as rather prissy and ineffective. [...] never met their standard of tough-mindedness." [...] Stevenson's refusal to publicly endorse Kennedy before the Democratic Convention was something that Kennedy [...] "couldn't forgive", with JFK telling a Stevenson supporter after the election, [...] "I'm {{not going to give}} him anything." [...] The prestigious post of Secretary of State went instead to the (then) little-known Dean Rusk. However, [...] "although Jack and Bobby would have been just as happy to freeze Stevenson out of the administration, they felt compelled to offer him something" [...] due to his continued support from progressive Democrats. President Kennedy offered Stevenson the choice of becoming [...] "ambassador to Britain, attorney general (a post that eventually went to Robert Kennedy), or United States Ambassador to the United Nations." [...] Stevenson accepted the latter position.|$|E
