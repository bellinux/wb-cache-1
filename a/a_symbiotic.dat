Biologist Eleanor Haine and colleagues analysed the DNA of the wasp across the fig's range and determined four cryptic lineages forming what they term the P. imperialis species complex. They diverge {{to a greater degree}} than some distinct wasp species, yet form a monophyletic group; this indicates that the wasp lineages have split without a change of host.|$|E

5|$|Fruit bodies can be {{inhabited}} by species of limoniid flies, such as Discobola marginata or Limonia yakushimensis, {{as well as}} several species of fungi-dwelling mites. The flies are hosts for the mites in <b>a</b> <b>symbiotic</b> association known as phoresis, whereby the mites are mechanically carried by its host. Mites are small and unable to migrate the relatively long distances between mushrooms without assistance; the insect hosts, in comparison, are large and can transfer the mites between their preferred feeding habitats.|$|E
5|$|Some trees {{such as the}} alders (Alnus species) have <b>a</b> <b>symbiotic</b> {{relationship}} with Frankia species, a filamentous bacterium that can fix nitrogen from the air, converting it into ammonia. They have actinorhizal root nodules on their roots in which the bacteria live. This process enables the tree to live in low nitrogen habitats where they would otherwise be unable to thrive. The plant hormones called cytokinins initiate root nodule formation, in a process closely related to mycorrhizal association.|$|E
5|$|A 2015 genetic {{study by}} {{evolutionary}} biologist Emma Harrower and colleagues of C.violaceus and its closest relatives {{suggests that the}} group (section Cortinarius) originated in Australasia and began diverging from a common ancestor around 12 million {{years ago in the}} Miocene, with C.violaceus itself diverging from its closest relative around 3.9 million years ago. The fact that these species diverged relatively recently indicates that some form of dispersal must have taken place across large bodies of water. The original plant hosts were flowering plants (angiosperms), and C.violaceus—or its direct ancestor—developed <b>a</b> <b>symbiotic</b> relationship with pines, as well as multiple flowering plants; this may have facilitated its expansion across the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|A typical {{sea anemone}} {{is a single}} polyp {{attached}} to a hard surface by its base, but some species live in soft sediment and a few float near {{the surface of the}} water. The polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth. The tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey. They are armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells). In many species, additional nourishment comes from <b>a</b> <b>symbiotic</b> relationship with single-celled dinoflagellates, zooxanthellae or with green algae, zoochlorellae, that live within the cells. Some species of sea anemone live in association with hermit crabs, small fish or other animals to their mutual benefit.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis is a {{rare species}} {{typically}} found growing {{on the ground in}} mountainous forests, both deciduous and coniferous. It is a mycorrhizal fungus, and exists in <b>a</b> <b>symbiotic</b> relationship with certain tree species. The system of fine below-ground threads, the mycelium, envelopes the roots of the trees and supplies them with needed minerals, trace elements and water from the soil, while the tree, in turn, supplies the fungus with food from its own supply, which it produces through photosynthesis. A.regalis has been shown experimentally to form mycorrhiza with birch, Scots pine, Mountain pine, and Norway spruce. Fruit bodies have been reported to grow in fairy rings.|$|E
5|$|Described by Pierre Bulliard in 1790 as Boletus piperatus, {{it is only}} distantly {{related to}} {{other members of the}} genus Boletus and was {{reclassified}} as Chalciporus piperatus by Frédéric Bataille in 1908. The genus Chalciporus was an early branching lineage in the Boletaceae and appears to be related to boletes with parasitic properties. Previously thought to be ectomycorrhizal (<b>a</b> <b>symbiotic</b> relationship that occurs between a fungus and the roots of various plant species), C.piperatus is now suspected of being parasitic on Amanita muscaria. The flesh of C.piperatus has a very peppery taste, and {{can be used as a}} condiment or flavouring.|$|E

5|$|Ecological {{interactions}} can {{be classified}} broadly into a host and an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate. Relationships within a species that are mutually or reciprocally beneficial are called mutualisms. Examples of mutualism include fungus-growing ants employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms, the fig wasp and yucca moth pollination complex, lichens with fungi and photosynthetic algae, and corals with photosynthetic algae. If there is a physical connection between host and associate, the relationship is called symbiosis. Approximately 60% of all plants, for example, have <b>a</b> <b>symbiotic</b> relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for mineral nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus piperatus (synonym Lactarius piperatus), {{commonly}} known as the peppery milk-cap, is a semi-edible basidiomycete fungus of the genus Lactifluus. Despite being edible, it is not recommended by some because of its poor taste, though can be used as seasoning when dried. The fruiting body is a creamy-white mushroom which is funnel-shaped when mature, with exceptionally crowded gills. It bleeds a whitish peppery-tasting milk when cut. Widely distributed across Europe and eastern North America, Lactifluus piperatus has been accidentally introduced to Australia. Mycorrhizal, it forms <b>a</b> <b>symbiotic</b> relationship with various species of deciduous tree, including beech, and hazel, and fruiting bodies are found on the forest floor in deciduous woodland.|$|E

Ethologically, the human keeper of a cat may function {{as a sort of}} surrogate for the cat's mother, and adult housecats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny. The high-pitched sounds housecats make to solicit food may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly hard for humans to ignore.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the surface}} of the Mono Craters is barren but its slopes are covered by Jeffrey pine forest and partial greenery. Pumice Valley, {{directly}} to the west, is covered by sagebrush scrubland. The soil consists primarily of deep pumice, which does not hold water well. Mycorrhizal fungi in the soil invade the roots of Jeffrey pine trees in <b>a</b> <b>symbiotic</b> relationship that helps the pine absorb water and provides nutrients to the fungi. Jeffrey pine forests also surround the Inyo Craters and Mammoth Mountain. Mule deer, coyotes, black bears, yellow-bellied marmots, raccoons and mountain lions all have ranges that are coincident with forests that cover parts of the Mono–Inyo craters.|$|E
5|$|Prey of cnidarians {{ranges from}} {{plankton}} to animals several {{times larger than}} themselves. Some cnidarians are parasites, mainly on jellyfish but a few are major pests of fish. Others obtain most of their nourishment from endosymbiotic algae or dissolved nutrients. Predators of cnidarians include: sea slugs, which can incorporate nematocysts into their own bodies for self-defense; starfish, notably the crown of thorns starfish, which can devastate corals; butterfly fish and parrot fish, which eat corals; and marine turtles, which eat jellyfish. Some sea anemones and jellyfish have <b>a</b> <b>symbiotic</b> relationship with some fish; for example clown fish live among the tentacles of sea anemones, and each partner protects the other against predators.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop {{lives on}} the seabed in the sublittoral zone between low tide mark and a depth of , on soft {{sediment}} or on rock, particularly in areas with a strong current. It is a filter feeder, sieving microscopic algae from water that passes through its gills. It is preyed on by starfish, octopuses and sea otters. It can detect predators by smell and by sight and can swim away from them by opening and closing its valves. Other organisms often grow on the exterior of its shell and it often forms <b>a</b> <b>symbiotic</b> relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on the upper valve and helps protect it from predators.|$|E

It also {{makes it more difficult}} for a starfish to get the strong grip with its tube feet that it needs to force the two valves of the scallop apart.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in 1774, the species has {{been transferred to}} various Boletaceae genera in its taxonomic history, although it retained the original name given to it by German botanist Jacob Christian Schaeffer until a transfer to genus Suillellus in 2014. Several varieties, a subspecies, and a form have been described by European mycologists. Suillellus luridus is mycorrhizal, forming <b>a</b> <b>symbiotic</b> association with deciduous trees such as oak, birch and beech, and {{has been found to}} have a growth-enhancing effect on conifers in experiments. The fruit bodies are highly attractive to, and often infested by, insects, and several species of fly have been recorded feeding on them. Chemical analyses have revealed some aspects of the mushroom's components, including its volatile flavour compounds, its fatty acid and amino acid compositions, and the identities of the carotenoid compounds responsible for its colour.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{explained}} {{that he had to}} wait until the mid-1980s to make the film because visual effects technology was finally advanced enough to execute his vision. Meanwhile, actor-turned-director Ron Howard was looking to do a fantasy film. He was at Industrial Light & Magic during the post-production phase of Cocoon, when he was first approached by Lucas to direct Willow. He had previously starred in Lucas' American Graffiti, and Lucas felt that he and Howard shared <b>a</b> <b>symbiotic</b> relationship similar to the one he enjoyed with Steven Spielberg. Howard nominated Bob Dolman to write the screenplay based on Lucas' story. Dolman had worked with him on a 1983 television pilot called Little Shots that had not resulted in a series, and Lucas admired Dolman's work on the sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati.|$|E
