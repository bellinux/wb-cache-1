5|$|Tornadoes {{are most}} likely in the spring. Major tornado {{outbreaks}} affected parts of eastern North Carolina on March 28, 1984, and April 16, 2011.

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} form as {{a result}} of significant convective activity, and <b>are</b> <b>warm</b> core. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. Cyclolysis is the opposite of cyclogenesis, and is the high-pressure system equivalent, which deals with the formation of high-pressure areas—Anticyclogenesis.|$|E
5|$|Zinfandel vines {{are quite}} {{vigorous}} and grow best in climates that <b>are</b> <b>warm</b> {{but not too}} hot, because grapes may shrivel in hot weather. Zinfandel's thin-skinned grapes grow in large, tight bunches that are sometimes prone to bunch rot. The fruit ripen fairly early and produce juice with high sugar content. If weather conditions permit, the grapes may be late-harvested to make dessert wine. Zinfandel is often praised {{for its ability to}} reflect both its terroir and its winemaker's style and skill.|$|E

5|$|Southern Manitoba (including {{the city}} of Winnipeg), falls into the humid {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen Dfb). This area is cold and windy {{in the winter and}} has frequent blizzards because of the open landscape. Summers <b>are</b> <b>warm</b> with a moderate length. This region is the most humid area in the prairie provinces, with moderate precipitation. Southwestern Manitoba, though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern Manitoba, is closer to the semi-arid interior of Palliser's Triangle. The area is drier and more prone to droughts than other parts of southern Manitoba. This area is cold and windy in the winter and has frequent blizzards due to the openness of the prairie landscape. Summers are generally warm to hot, with low to moderate humidity.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclogenesis}} {{describes the}} process of development of tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity, and <b>are</b> <b>warm</b> core. Cyclones can transition between extratropical, subtropical, and tropical phases. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, {{and can lead to}} tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. In the Atlantic and the northeastern Pacific oceans, a tropical cyclone is generally referred to as a hurricane (from the name of the ancient Central American deity of wind, Huracan), in the Indian and south Pacific oceans it is called a cyclone, and in the northwestern Pacific it is called a typhoon.|$|E
5|$|Two other {{well known}} Cabernet Sauvignon flavors are mint and eucalyptus. Mint flavors are often {{associated}} with wine regions that <b>are</b> <b>warm</b> enough to have low pyrazine levels but are still generally cool, such as Australia's Coonawarra region and some areas of Washington State. There is some belief that soil {{could also be a}} contributor to the minty notes, since the flavor also appears in some wines from the Pauillac region but not from similar climate of Margaux. Resinous Eucalyptus flavors tend to appear in regions that are habitats for the eucalyptus tree, such as California's Napa and Sonoma valleys and parts of Australia, but there has been no evidence to conclusively prove a direct link between proximity of eucalyptus trees and the presence of that flavor in the wine.|$|E
