40|$|It {{has been}} shown that in an {{otherwise}} standard one-sector real business cycle model with an indeterminate steady state under laissez faire, su ¢ ciently progressive income tax-ation may stabilize the economy against aggregate uctuations caused by agentsanimal spirits. We show that this previous 8 ̆ 5 nding can be overturned within an identical model which allows for sustained endogenous growth. Speci 8 ̆ 5 cally, progressive taxation may op-erate like an <b>automatic</b> <b>destabilizer</b> that leads to equilibrium indeterminacy and sunspot-driven cyclical uctuations in an endogenously growing macroeconomy. This instability result is obtained under two tractable progressive tax policy formulations that have been considered in the existing literature...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{macroeconomics}} of fiscal austerity and deflation {{in an economy}} with public debt. A binding budget deficit cap destabilizes the economy by turning the government budget into an <b>automatic</b> <b>destabilizer.</b> Public debt helps maintain AD {{in the presence of}} deflation because deflation increases the real value of public interest payments. That makes public debt significantly different from private debt. If the economy is subject to a binding deficit cap, deflation no longer stabilizes output. This is because increased real interest payments must be matched by spending cuts, giving rise to a negative balanced budget multiplier. fiscal austerity, budget deficit cap, public debt, deflation growth theory...|$|E
