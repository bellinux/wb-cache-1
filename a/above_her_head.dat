The title of the record is an abbreviation of Stan's stage name, also meaning 'ready' in Turkish. The accompanying artwork for the Japanese and other versions of the album show Stan posing {{in front of a}} black backdrop, with lettering displayed in white or red <b>above</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Editions of Alesta released by Ego Records and Warner Bros. Records featured a photograph with her laying over a motorcycle sporting a blonde wig, white underwear and a distorted pair of blue jeans.|$|E
5|$|Knowles rehearsed {{the pole}} dancing using two ballet bars, which {{was when it}} was decided to add a pole <b>above</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to form an arc. Though she is from Texas, she had never {{previously}} been on mechanical bull. There were no problems during warm-ups, but the man operating the bull during the video shoot programmed it to go faster, causing Knowles to fall off when she tried to perform tricks such as lifting up her foot, leaning back and turning around. To minimize the time Knowles spent on the bull, the director shot the sequence at twelve frames per second (see frame rate) and Knowles sang twice as quickly, but it wasn't until 4:00am that they completed work.|$|E
5|$|The name of Djedkare Isesi's {{principal}} wife is not known. An important queen consort {{whose name}} is lost was very likely {{the owner of a}} large pyramid complex located to the northeast of Djedkare's pyramid in Saqqara. This could indicate that she was the mother of Djedkare's successor, Unas, or that Djedkare owed the throne to her. The very high status of this queen is suggested by some features of her funerary complex that are otherwise reserved to kings: her pyramid has its own satellite pyramid, has a causeway leading from a valley temple up to a mortuary temple devoted to the cult of the queen and had an entrance hall pr-wrw, an open courtyard and a square antechamber. Furthermore, some reliefs showing the queen had been reworked with royal insignia and vultures added <b>above</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Since the construction of the queen's pyramid was apparently undertaken after the planning of Djedkare's pyramid and her relief had been reworked, the Egyptologist Klaus Baer suggests that this queen may have ruled after the death of Djedkare, playing an important role in his succession. This is rejected by other Egyptologists, such as Michel Baud, owing to the lack of evidence for a regency or interregnum between Djedkare and Unas.|$|E

25|$|The Jesse {{window of}} 1892 by Lavers & Westlake is a {{colourful}} design. All {{the figures are}} seated in the vine except for the Virgin Mary who is seated within a flowering virga, outside the vine. <b>Above</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> are seven doves representing the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. The figures in the window are; in the first light - Hezekiah, Solomon, Melchizedek. Middle light - Jesse, David, the Virgin and Christchild on her knee. Third light - Jehoshaphat, Asa, and Isaiah. The three light window {{is dedicated to the}} Honourable J J Carnagie born 8 July 1807 died 18 January 1892, placed in the church by Henry Allen Rolls (brother of the co-founder of Rolls Royce Limited) in 1892.|$|E
500|$|The Statue of Liberty is {{a figure}} of a robed woman {{representing}} Libertas, a Roman goddess.

A broken chain lies at her feet. The statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States, and was a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving from abroad.|$|E
500|$|... "Perfect Illusion" [...] was {{performed}} {{live for the}} first time at Moth Club in London, on September 10, 2016. Gaga was wearing a crop top tee and silver shorts, alongside a microphone, which she twirled <b>above</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> while dancing. Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone noted that the singer sang [...] "her energetic, driving dance-rock single with a head-banging performance that mirrored the single's cover art". Gaga also performed a snippet of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] at the same venue following [...] "Perfect Illusion". It was also performed on Gaga's three date long Dive Bar Tour where it was the closing song of the setlist on two occasions.|$|E

500|$|Both the {{symbolic}} {{form and the}} actual body of insects {{have been used to}} adorn humans in ancient and modern times. A recurrent theme for ancient cultures in Europe and the Near East regarded the sacred image of a bee or human with insect features. [...] Often referred to as the bee [...] "goddess", [...] these images were found in gems and stones. An onyx gem from Knossos (ancient Crete) dating to approximately 1500 BC illustrates a Bee goddess with bull horns <b>above</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> [...] In this instance, the figure is surrounded by dogs with wings, most likely representing Hecate and Artemis – gods of the underworld, similar to the Egyptian gods Akeu and Anubis.|$|E
500|$|The video {{features}} Madonna in {{a stylized}} recording studio singing the song with back up singers. The video {{was compared to}} the music video of Madonna's single [...] "Rain" [...] (1993). Her look in the video, consists of blue-black icy hair, bright blue eyes and a long dark dress with a beaded necklace around her neck. Madonna's face was mainly shot <b>above</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> with her face looking up {{just ahead of the}} camera focus. Sometimes she looks to a video screen behind her which plays the scenes from the film, as if to take inspiration for her singing. Other times she is accompanied by her back-up singers, mainly during the chorus, and sometimes she sings alone. In front of the studio, the producers are shown deciding which part of the song should be put in lower bass.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} verse, Aguilera {{appears in a}} red 1960's style outfit and listens to music with silver {{spangled}} headphones while a gramophone plays. While singing the second chorus, Aguilera {{is in front of}} photographers; she continues to sing in an inter-cut scene, wearing silver and gold outfits, one trimmed with fur. In the next sequence, Aguilera wears a white and black outfit with a black-sequined beret, and continues dancing through the chorus. At the bridge, she walks through the bar and finds her lover. She pushes him down on a chair and pushes him away across the polished dance-floor. She is then lifted onto the billiard table and continues to sing while the chandelier <b>above</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> begins to explode and spark fireworks. At the chorus she appears in a sparkling silver dress and makes the whole club come alive in a riot of dancing. There is a brief funk outro. As the video ends, with the club now empty, Aguilera gently sings [...] "I Got Trouble" [...] again, lying on the piano while the people in the club watch her.|$|E
6000|$|He {{caught sight}} of himself in the pier glass, drawn up to his full height, and with a face so white that his eyes, at the distance, resembled the black {{cavities}} in a skull.

500|$|Summer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore, one of Denmark's {{most popular}} works, was painted in 1892. It shows Marie {{standing}} on the beach with Rap by her side and the moonlight reflected in the sea. She is shown in profile and her melancholy face and bright dress glow under {{the light of the}} setting sun. The painting is one of the works in which Krøyer tries to capture the light and mood on the Skagen shore during what he called [...] "l'heure bleue" [...] (the blue hour), the short period at dusk when the light casts a blue tint over the landscape. The Symbolists believed the twilight hour heralded the coming of death. The moon's reflection adds a slight feeling of depth to the otherwise flat background which consists mostly of the monolithic blue sea. Marie is depicted as being at a similar height to the viewer, but the horizon rises <b>above</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> emphasizing her radiance against the muted, nearly monochrome background.|$|E
500|$|... "Bad Romance" [...] {{was also}} {{performed}} at the 2009 American Music Awards, where she coupled it with [...] "Speechless" [...] from The Fame Monster. Gaga {{was dressed in a}} flesh-colored bodysuit wrapped with white piping and embedded with flashing lights, imitating ribs and a spine. The performance started with [...] "Bad Romance", with Gaga dancing around the stage and ultimately breaking open a glass door with the microphone stand. It was performed on The Jay Leno Show, where Gaga wore a pair of black sunglasses and a black jacket with shoulder pads that extended <b>above</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Her male back-up dancers were dressed in black suits and S-inspired headgear. Both [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and [...] "Speechless" [...] were performed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on November 25, 2009. Gaga performed [...] "Bad Romance" [...] on the British TV show The X Factor on December 6, 2009. The performance there had her singing inside a 4-m long bathtub and playing the piano while sitting on a toilet. [...] "Bad Romance" [...] was performed as the last song of Gaga's The Monster Ball Tour. Wearing an 1980s-inspired white power suit with exaggerated high shoulders and high-waisted pants, she performed the song while standing in a human-sized gyroscope.|$|E
500|$|The game {{is played}} {{over the course of}} a school semester; the first day of school is on April 1. In [...] "boy mode", each day concludes with a super {{deformed}} image of the heroine the player chose at the onset of the game slumped over her computer in her room; an email message from a girl that she interacted with during the day in on the monitor. As the heroine sleeps, the object of her affection appears in a thought bubble <b>above</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> In [...] "girl mode", she is seen writing in her diary instead. The first day in the game requires no interaction from the player. The player gets through the first day by reading the text and getting acquainted with the girls. The game uses an angel and devil system where miniature angel and devil versions of each girl float beside her when critical decisions have to be made; this is not restricted to the three playable characters. It also features a [...] "Strawberry chance" [...] system, where the outcome of some scenes changes if the player presses one of the analog sticks fast enough after the message [...] is displayed in the upper right screen corner.|$|E
25|$|A goal umpire judges {{whether a}} goal or behind is scored.

It is herself. No word is spoken; no other soul is seen. They enter the room of the double casement; and Pierre sits down, overpowered with bodily faintness and spiritual awe.

50|$|Sidra is {{traditionally}} poured in by an expert server (or escanciador): the bottle is raised high <b>above</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to oxygenate the brew {{as it moves}} into the glass below. A small amount (~120ml) is poured at a time (called a culín), as it must be drunk immediately before the sidra loses its carbonation. Any sidra left in the glass is poured onto a woodchip-strewn floor or a trough {{along the bottom of}} the bar.|$|R
500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of the video, Roberts {{released}} still images to website 3am. These showed her in what was described as [...] "some sort of untidy, yet fashionable looking house", while one showed her with her legs <b>above</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> wearing [...] "Kandee's caramel kisses shoes" [...] and a third and final seeing her [...] "cosying up next to a handsome chap". [...] The same day, Roberts gave two more exclusive stills to website Digital Spy; in one image, she was smelling roses, while, in the second, she was [...] "playing with a pair of shoes". The video was released on 30 November 2011. After the official release, Nadia Mendoza of the Daily Mail stated the video was a departure from her previous two videos (for [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] and [...] "Lucky Day"), saying that it [...] "looks and sounds a lot more grown up as she teases viewers by stripping to her bra and frolicking in the shower." [...] Mendoza found that Roberts was [...] "becoming quite the chameleon" [...] and had [...] "trampled all over her innocent charm to create a sex siren", referencing her transformation throughout her videos. Katherine St Asaph, of Pop Dust, found that the video's low budget had had a negative effect. She interpreted scenes with Roberts repeated changes clothing positively, noting [...] "t works because of the lyrics what, besides other people, can mess with your feelings more than trying on clothes?" ...|$|E
500|$|She also {{performed}} a disco-styled {{version of the}} song during The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993. The stage was decked in Mylar curtains and glittering disco balls. The performance began with a distorted voice claiming [...] "I'm gonna {{take you to a}} place you've never been before". Afterwards, Madonna descended from the ceiling on a giant disco ball, wearing a blond afro wig, 1970's style halters and royal blue bell-bottom pants. Then her two back-up dancers appeared on the stage and the three women started singing the song together. The end of the performance was connected to the next song, [...] "Deeper and Deeper". According to Guilbert, Madonna was inspired by actress Marlene Dietrich in the 1932 film Blonde Venus for the performance. It was included on The Girlie Show – Live Down Under home video release, recorded on November 19, 1993, at Sydney, Australia. [...] "Express Yourself" [...] was included in the military segment of the Re-Invention World Tour in 2004, with the opening line altered to [...] "Come on boys!". She and her dancers were dressed in military gear and performed a rifle choreography, with Madonna acting as a sergeant. As Drew Sterwald from News Press noted, the song in its military version was talking about both personal love, as well as patriotic love. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that the song was contravened as cynical, when Madonna sang the line, [...] "What you need is a big, strong hand/To lift you to your higher ground", and raised a rifle <b>above</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Author Dirk Timmerman pointed out that [...] "in the context of the show, with [...] performances like 'American Life' and 'Imagine', it added to the anti-war message of the tour." [...] In 2008, during the Sticky & Sweet Tour, she performed [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as the request song in some of her shows, including the show at Madison Square Garden in New York.|$|E

60|$|There was {{something}} in this suggestion of a hunted animal that, unlike anything she had previously said or suggested, was not exaggerated, and caused the young man {{to look at her}} again. She was standing under the chimney-like opening, and the light from <b>above</b> illuminated <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and shoulders. The pupils of her eyes had lost their feverish prominence, and were slightly suffused and softened as she gazed abstractedly before her. The only vestige of her previous excitement was in her left-hand fingers, which were incessantly twisting and turning a diamond ring upon her right hand, but without imparting the least animation to her rigid attitude. Suddenly, as if conscious of his scrutiny, she stepped aside out of the revealing light and by a swift feminine instinct raised her hand to <b>her</b> <b>head</b> as if to adjust her straggling hair. It was only for a moment, however, for, as if aware of the weakness, she struggled to resume her aggressive pose.|$|R
50|$|A penalty card {{is used in}} many {{sports as}} a means of warning, reprimanding or penalising a player, coach or team official. Penalty cards are most {{commonly}} used by referees or umpires to indicate that a player has committed an offense. The referee will hold the card <b>above</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>head</b> while looking or pointing towards the player that has committed the offense. The colour and/or shape of the card used by the official indicates the type or seriousness of the offence and the level of punishment that is to be applied.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most famous}} {{regional}} dish is Fabada Asturiana, a rich stew made with large white beans (fabes), pork shoulder (llacón), morciella, chorizu, and saffron (azafrán). Apple groves foster {{the production of}} the traditional alcoholic drink, a natural cider (sidra). It is a very dry cider, and unlike French or English natural ciders, uses predominantly acidic apples, rather than sweet or bittersweet. Sidra is traditionally poured in by an expert server (or escanciador): the bottle is raised high <b>above</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to oxygenate the brew as it moves into the glass below.|$|R
2500|$|Folk beliefs {{dominated}} {{the region in}} the past and continue to influence birth practices.
