5|$|The news of Selena's death deeply {{affected}} the Latino community; many people traveled {{thousands of miles}} to visit Selena's house, boutiques, and the crime scene. By mid-afternoon, police were asked to form a detour as a line of automobiles began backing up traffic from the Quintanillas' house. On the street where Selena had lived, gang graffiti and cacti distinguished the blue-collar community from other subdivisions across America. <b>A</b> <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> in front of Selena's house became a shrine festooned with mementos as fans from across America left messages to Selena and the Quintanilla family. Most car drivers in Corpus Christi, and those driving cars on Interstate 37 from Mexico, turned their headlights on in her memory. Fans scribbled notes and messages, and placed them {{on the door and}} doorstep of the room in which Selena had been shot.|$|E
25|$|The {{site was}} {{impacted}} through modern anthropogenic modifications of the landscape. Most noticeable was a concrete-filled posthole for <b>a</b> <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence.</b> The auguring of the posthole {{was the cause}} for discovery of both the Moatfield village and ossuary. Despite the unearthing of human remains, construction continued and the posthole was filled with concrete; an action that impacted the bones immediately adjacent and below the posthole. Electrical wiring and water pipes also transected the site but had no direct effect on the ossuary.|$|E
25|$|By August 15, {{the inmates}} {{reportedly}} surrendered after being {{promised to be}} transferred to a prison in Manila. Gunshots were fired as inmates crossed <b>a</b> <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> along with the hostages, some of whom were able to escape while the rest were dragged back into the prison. According to one of the captives who escaped, nine of the hostages, including the Australian missionary Jacqueline Hamill, were raped by the inmates. This led the military to storm into the prison later that day after the hostage takers continued to refuse to cooperate.|$|E

50|$|The {{ballpark}} site {{is south}} of Eastern Parkway {{and west of}} Brook Street, near the university campus. The field itself remains, and is still used for intramural football and soccer at the university. The stadium seating has long since been demolished. In the early 2000s there were still some visible remnants of the ballfield, including the poorly kept diamond, backstop, dugouts and outfield walls. Those have since been removed, leaving just <b>a</b> <b>chain-link</b> <b>fenced,</b> rectangular football/soccer field.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the engine}} and tender were {{successfully}} relocated during the Fall of 1960, it was several more years before the steel shed was erected overhead to protect the locomotive. In addition to the Pine Bluff Jaycees, the City of Pine Bluff and the Pine Bluff Park Commission each donated $500. Pine Bluff Mayor Franks personally donated $250 and another $250 was donated by the Townsend Park Commission. Gene Gardner, an engineer with International Paper, designed the green and white steel shed and drew up the plans for it. International Paper Company and the Pine Bluff Sand & Gravel Company furnished the concrete footings for the shed, while Varco Steel did the construction work. Construction of the shed was completed in September 1965 when <b>a</b> <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> was installed and the landscaping was finished.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s, {{the site}} housed a {{research}} group that used radar to scan approaching thunder storms {{as far away}} as western New York State, as part of an inquiry into the causes of lightning. Findings by this group were instrumental {{in the development of the}} US weather radar program. The installation consisted of a steel tower supporting a second-hand military radar set, several Quonset huts and box trailers, surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence.</b> Group members were on call to monitor the radar whenever severe storms could be observed. Data were also collected from a network of amateur co-operative observers who corresponded by mail. This era coincided with the end of the long career of the famous Director of the Observatory, Dr. Charles Brooks, said to be one of the few who accurately forecast the path of the destructive Hurricane of September, 1938.|$|E
500|$|... "Kill Switch" [...] {{was written}} outside the mytharc {{of the series}} as a {{standalone}} story, which Gibson intended to be reminiscent of the [...] "dark visions" [...] of filmmaker David Cronenberg and to contain [...] "many obvious pokes and prods at high-end academic cyberculture." [...] Gibson's initial idea for the episode eventually evolved into the episode's final act. This was later combined with Maddox's idea of a deserted house with shuttered windows, surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence.</b> The episode involved the merging of human and artificial intelligence on the World Wide Web, a concept that had been floating around cyber-futuristic circles at the time. The episode's rewriting and revision process took {{a significant amount of}} time and it was over a year before the episode was completed due to other priorities that series creator Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz had. When they were finally available, they made some revisions to the script, including upping Esther's attitude and Mulder and Scully's reactions to her. A scene involving Scully trying on a fake nose ring was deleted from the script. Gibson originally started watching the series on the suggestion of his daughter, 15 years old at the time. During filming, Gibson spent a majority of his time on the set only [...] "because [...] daughter insisted on being there." ...|$|E
50|$|There are no shrubs, trees, or grass {{inside the}} compound, which is double fenced. The {{interior}} <b>fence,</b> <b>a</b> heavy-duty <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence,</b> is approximately 20 feet tall, curves inward near the top, and is {{topped with a}} roll of razor-wire. The outside fence is also <b>a</b> heavy-duty <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence.</b> It is taller than the interior fence, also curves inward near its top, and is equipped with not one, but two, rolls of razor-wire along its top. Another roll of razor-wire is attached {{along the bottom of}} the exterior fence, making even an approach to the fence difficult, if not impossible. Instead of grass, shrubs, and trees, the compound inside the double fence contains raked gravel which is tan in color.|$|R
25|$|To {{celebrate}} the millennium on December 31, 1999, the National Christmas Tree's lights turned white at midnight. The following year, Polk Aristo-Craft expanded the model train display {{and a new}} wrought iron fence was erected around the tree (replacing <b>an</b> older <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence).</b>|$|R
50|$|Until mid-2009, <b>a</b> single <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> {{marked the}} {{international}} border within the park. People {{on opposite sides}} of the border were able to touch and pass objects through the barrier. United Methodist pastor John Fanestil served communion through the fence during 2008 and 2009.|$|R
2500|$|In 1987, a CSX train derailed {{near the}} Takoma station, where the freight trains and Metro tracks {{run along the}} same corridor. The CSX train tore through <b>a</b> <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> and onto the Metro tracks. One car {{penetrated}} the Metro power substation building adjacent to the tracks, causing significant damage. [...] This accident led NTSB to recommend an intrusion detection warning system along this stretch of tracks.|$|E
2500|$|The last Blues {{performances}} on Maxwell Street occurred in 1999-2000, on a bandstand erected by Frank [...] "Little Sonny" [...] Scott, Jr., near the north-east corner of Maxwell and Halsted Streets, on land recently vacated by {{the demolition of}} a historic building. The extension cord ran from the last remaining building in use, the Maxworks Cooperative headquarters, [...] east, at 716 Maxwell Street. One day a University crew arrived and erected <b>a</b> <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> between the bandstand and the sidewalk, effectively banning the performances though they continued a few weeks longer on the too-narrow sidewalk.|$|E
2500|$|When Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev {{declared}} a unilateral {{moratorium on the}} testing of nuclear weapons, which would begin on August 6, 1985—the 40thanniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima—the Reagan administration dismissed the dramatic move {{as nothing more than}} propaganda, and refused to follow suit. In response, US anti-nuclear and peace activists staged a series of protest actions at the Nevada Test Site, beginning on Easter Sunday in 1986 and continuing through 1987. Hundreds of people in the [...] "Nevada Desert Experience" [...] group were arrested, including Sagan, who was arrested on two separate occasions as he climbed over <b>a</b> <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> at the test site during the underground Operation Charioteer and United States's Musketeer nuclear test series of detonations.|$|E
5000|$|Remains of {{more than}} 80 people were uncovered. When the late Chief Viola Wyse {{requested}} that B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell protect the site the province purchased it. It remained [...] "sad, forlorn and neglected", surrounded by <b>a</b> bent <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> and covered in straggled patches of weeds.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> 3.4 mi <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> {{has been}} {{constructed}} along the US 98 causeway (Battleship Parkway) {{that separates the}} Mobile-Tensaw delta from Mobile Bay. [...] Hatchling deaths dropped 80% from 2007 to 2008.|$|R
5000|$|Those who {{attended}} were provided free campsites, free parking and free firewood. There were restrooms and showers every 500 feet, medical staff, motorcycle and dune buggy trails, a lake with a beach, {{and also the}} [...] "longest slide in the world". To keep gate crashers out, the site was surrounded by <b>a</b> high <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> topped by barbed wire.|$|R
2500|$|... "These [...] zones {{routinely}} {{succeed in}} keeping protesters out of presidential sight {{and outside the}} view of media covering the event. When Bush came to the Pittsburgh area on Labor Day 2002, 65-year-old retired steel worker Bill Neel was there to greet him with a sign proclaiming, 'The Bush family must surely love the poor, they made so many of us.' The local police, at the Secret Service's behest, set up a 'designated free-speech zone' on a baseball field surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> {{a third of a}} mile from the location of Bush's speech. The police cleared the path of the motorcade of all critical signs, though folks with pro-Bush signs were permitted to line the president's path. Neel refused to go to the designated area and was arrested for disorderly conduct. Police detective John Ianachione testified that the Secret Service told local police to confine 'people that were there making a statement pretty much against the president and his views.'" [...] District justice Shirley Trkula threw out the charges, stating that [...] "I believe this is America. Whatever happened to 'I don't agree with you, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it'?" ...|$|E

5000|$|... 50 to 100 ft behind {{home plate}} is the backstop, {{which is a}} wall/fence that will stop wild pitches, passed balls, and foul balls. In {{enclosed}} stadiums, the backstop is often composed of a lower part, which is like {{any other part of}} the wall, and an upper netting to protect spectators seated behind it; in recreational baseball fields, there is usually <b>a</b> tall <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence,</b> including <b>an</b> angled top section, composing the entire backstop.|$|R
50|$|Security {{included}} <b>a</b> single <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> about 20 {{feet high}} with razor wire, cameras, and guards. Guards {{were divided into}} three sections, composed of United States Navy and United States Marine Corps personnel in ranks from E-1 to E-6/7. In addition to security personnel, the Brig had a small administration staff including medical personnel and civilian cooks who worked with inmates to prepare meals. The Brig also offered a small library and chapel for weekly services.|$|R
25|$|Georgia's {{fans have}} only rushed {{the field and}} torn down the goal posts once in the stadium's history. This {{happened}} on October 7, 2000, after the Bulldogs beat rival Tennessee {{for the first time}} since 1988. This statistic is usually credited to the fact that the hedges serve not only cosmetic purposes, but also help with crowd control. Aiding this cause is that the hedges surround, and largely conceal, <b>a</b> low <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> running through their branches around the circumference of the field.|$|R
5000|$|... 97% of {{the barrier}} is <b>a</b> <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> {{similar to those}} along the United States's border; only 3% (10 miles) is a {{concrete}} wall, built to prevent sniper shooting prevalent in certain areas.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the opening}} of the festival Friday, a {{security}} guard was left in [...] "extremely critical" [...] condition after being trampled by a crowd of people attempting to gate crash the festival by breaking down <b>a</b> <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{popularity}} of chain-link fence is from its relatively low cost {{and that the}} open weave does not obscure sunlight from {{either side of the}} fence. One can make <b>a</b> <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> semi-opaque by inserting slats into the mesh.|$|E
25|$|Eddie finally finds Jake. They go to {{the first}} dance venue, but find it is closed {{following}} the discovery of Joey's body. Jake climbs over <b>a</b> tall <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> to retrieve his motorcycle, and Eddie goes after him. On his motorcycle, Jake heads for the exit to circle around and return to Eddie. The killer finds Eddie inside the closed dance venue, and attacks him. Eddie locks himself in <b>a</b> shallow <b>chain-link</b> enclosure. The killer slashes at Eddie with his scythe; {{the tip of the}} blade just touches Eddie's glass eye. Jake arrives with a police officer, and the killer leaves.|$|R
50|$|The Hole in the Horn {{buck was}} found dead along a {{railroad}} in Kent, Ohio in 1940. The buck was discovered {{by a group of}} railroad workers who had noticed the dead animal stuck under <b>a</b> nearby <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> of the Ravenna Arsenal. The group of men freed the massive set of antlers. A shoulder mount of the buck was made by a local taxidermist and hung in the nearby Kent Canadian Club. It hung {{on the wall of the}} private hunting club for the next 40 years.|$|R
50|$|On 30 July 2011, Caribbean Airlines Flight 523 overran {{a runway}} in rainy weather while landing at Cheddi Jagan International Airport {{and went through}} <b>a</b> <b>chain-link</b> {{perimeter}} <b>fence.</b> The aircraft, a Boeing 737-800, broke in two just behind the first class cabin. There were no fatalities, although at least two passengers suffered broken legs and many others suffered lacerations and other injuries. Caribbean Airlines confirmed that 157 passengers and 6 crew members were on board the aircraft at the time.|$|R

It is made from wood, has an inclined roof, and a covered porch. Two windows and a door are only partially visible, since they are obstructed by miscellaneous bushes and shrubs which run across the front. To the left a second building is visible with one window, a chimney, and an inclined, shingled roof. <b>A</b> thin <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence</b> runs in front of the shrubs, and trees are visible in the background...|$|R
50|$|Now an {{open field}} near the Sky Country Trailhead, this was an {{anti-aircraft}} Nike missile installation during the Cold War used to protect the region from nuclear attack by Soviet long range strategic bombers. All that is left from that era are a few concrete pads, landscaping features, <b>a</b> deteriorating <b>chain-link</b> <b>fence,</b> and <b>an</b> interpretive sign. Current amenities include restrooms, picnic tables, a playfield, wildlife interpretive signs, {{and access to the}} great trail system. The radar site supporting these missiles was located on Anti-Aircraft Peak one mile to the northeast where another interpretive sign provides more history of the site.|$|R
