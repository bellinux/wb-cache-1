Each wagon has a Controller {{that carries the}} control load and an Entertainment server that handles the entertainment. A supervisory controller runs {{on top of the}} two controllers and the two entertainment servers. Contrary to a similar model in the literature, the Supervisory node replaces a Controller as soon as it fails (<b>Active</b> <b>Supervisor).</b> All system states are analyzed and simulated using OPNET. It is shown that, for all states, this architecture has zero control packets dropped and the end-to-end delay is below the maximum target delay. A comparison between this Active model and the other model in the literature is presented. It is found that the entertainment in this new architecture is kept available for the passengers in more of the system states when compared to the architecture previously presented in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Payment {{services}} are, {{at their}} simplest, services for moving money around the economy. These services carry risks for the provider and the customer, from credit and insolvency risk, through to fraud and ‘mere’ errors. Different societies deal with, manage and allocate these risks differently. There {{are a number}} of similarities in how these services are regulated, and the careful observer can identify patterns and themes. As the economy continues to be heavily reliant on payment services for its efficient operation, commentators and governments have taken a keen interest in these services. This paper examines the six key regulatory risks for payment services: credit risk, efficiency risk, product mis-match, product failure, transactional failure and privacy. Previous articles have considered recent industry and technological developments in the payments industry, many of which post-date the existing regulatory regime in most jurisdictions. This paper draws conclusions about how a best practice regime might address recent innovations such as mobile payments, online payment services and ‘stored value’ cards. While there is significant commonality between regulatory regimes, there is not yet a common approach to many payment services issues. The goal of this project (and this paper) is to develop a better or best practice framework for the regulation of payment services, drawing on {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the existing regimes. A best practice regime is identified – including both the elements or building blocks, and how and when they should be applied. The elements, based on analysis of key national regimes, are fair play rules, systemic stability, an <b>active</b> <b>supervisor,</b> broad scope, licensing, disclosure, obligations of the parties, liability, dispute resolution and privacy. The paper also explains how these elements can be combined to construct a coherent overall regime. The result is a recommended best practice model involving licensing, disclosure, conduct and redress standards in a three-tiered structure (thus providing a lighter-touch regime for low value products and a more intensive regime for more substantial banking-style products) ...|$|E

The theoretical considerations on practice learning stemmed from three mail ap-proaches: a learning-centred approach, a system-centred approach (practice place-ment, operational milieu, professional system), and a reflexivity-centred approach. Each approach yielded its own definition of a “good” practice learning experience. 32 semi-structured interviews were carried out with practice students and <b>supervisors</b> <b>active</b> in two Social Work Italian degree course, following a non-standard methodol-ogy and a constructivist epistemological model. A non-representative sample was se-lected with an informed choice. Based on the answers, three idealtypes were discovered, describing how students “put themselves to the test” in their placement: as “agents”, aiming towards operative knowledge, as “actors”, aiming towards a circular theory-practice knowledge, as “au-thors”, aiming towards a “personal” knowledge, in Polanyi’s sense. Both students and supervisors have shown advanced awareness of the professional nature of Social Work and its characterising constituents: shared culture, authoritativeness based on certified competences, the deontological code, the theoretical reference corpus. </br...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Clinical {{learning}} {{takes place}} in complex socio-cultural environments that are workplaces for the staff and learning places for the students. In the clinical context, the students learn by active participation and in interaction {{with the rest of}} the community at the workplace. Clinical learning occurs outside the university, therefore is it important for both the university and the student that the student is given opportunities to evaluate the clinical placements with an instrument that allows evaluation from many perspectives. The instrument Clinical Learning Environment and Supervision (CLES) was originally developed for evaluation of nursing students’ clinical learning environment. The aim of this study was to adapt and validate the CLES instrument to measure medical students’ perceptions of their learning environment in primary health care. Methods In the adaptation process the face validity was tested by an expert panel of primary care physicians, who were also <b>active</b> clinical <b>supervisors.</b> The adapted CLES instrument with 25 items and six background questions was sent electronically to 1, 256 medical students from one university. Answers from 394 students were eligible for inclusion. Exploratory factor analysis based on principal component methods followed by oblique rotation was used to confirm the adequate number of factors in the data. Construct validity was assessed by factor analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to confirm the dimensions of CLES instrument. Results The construct validity showed a clearly indicated four-factor model. The cumulative variance explanation was 0. 65, and the overall Cronbach’s alpha was 0. 95. All items loaded similarly with the dimensions in the non-adapted CLES except for one item that loaded to another dimension. The CLES instrument in its adapted form had high construct validity and high reliability and internal consistency. Conclusion CLES, in its adapted form, appears to be a valid instrument to evaluate medical students’ perceptions of their clinical learning environment in primary health care...|$|R

Therefore, the present study was performed to increase <b>active</b> particapitation of <b>supervisors</b> in production line and also to identify and assess ergonomics risks and presenting modification actions (Kaizen) by themselves in Pars Khodro automobile manufacturing company. Methods: A manual regarding lifting objects and body postures, according to the Finish evaluation method, was provided for supervisors in production line and related trainings were presented to them. Then, they were asked to insert the results of their assessments and suggestions in special forms during one year. The presented assessments and suggestions were examined by ergonomics experts. Results: According to the assessments conducted by supervisors, 26 work stations had high ergonomics risks, 51 had ergonomics risks with an average level, and 45 had low ergonomics risks. Moreover, the number of required Kaizens presented by supervisors was increased from 18 cases in the first year to 42 cases in the second year, after implementation of ergonomics training and identifying and assessing ergonomic risks by supervisors. Conclusion: Empowering and training supervisors increased workers' participation. In case of adequate training, supervisors can present practical solutions to reduce ergonomics risks in their workstations...|$|R

Using a collective case study approach, {{interviews were conducted with}} a total of 23 campus activities staff members and six senior student affairs officers at four institutions achieving comprehensive recognition for excellence in campus activities programs from one professional association. Administrators explored Boyer 2 ̆ 7 s (1990) frames of scholarship and shared experiences with the engagement with the four frames of scholarship in their daily work. Findings presented highlight a strong identification between participants and the scholarship of teaching, moderate engagement with application and integration, and a significant disconnect from the scholarship of discovery. In addition, findings indicate a number of venues in everyday practice that practitioners believe connect with Boyer 2 ̆ 7 s (1990) frames of scholarship, but that this type of work may not be accepted as forms of scholarship within campus culture at these four institutions. Practitioners also shared mindset obstacles that prevented engagement as well as their hope for a more <b>active</b> role of <b>supervisors</b> and professional preparation programs in supporting the scholar-practitioner balance.

40|$|The present thesis {{explored}} {{student learning}} at a clinical education ward with an explicit pedagogical framework. Although nursing students were {{the focus of}} the studies the intention is to gain more generally understanding of student learning in clinical settings. Learning in this thesis is understood as a transformative process that involves knowledge construction and meaning-making processes. Clinical education is carried out in real clinical work-places and consists of encounters with patients, health- care professionals and peer students. Students train their future professional role in these encounters. Previous research has shown challenges that are tied to both organizational and pedagogical issues indicating that clinical learning environments are not always ideal. One way to meet these challenges is by introducing clinical education wards. These are units run collaboratively by educational institutions and the clinical settings; they train students on different levels and focus on inter-professional training or on one profession. The overall aim of the present thesis was to contribute to our understanding of students’ learning at a clinical education ward where students are supported in taking care of patients independently. A qualitative approach was used to explore students’ learning from the perspectives of students, patients and supervisors. The theory of transformative learning and the concepts of authenticity and threshold were used in interpreting and understanding of the findings. The results show that the core of student learning at a clinical education ward is the experience of both external and internal authenticity In Study I, first-year nursing students created mutual relationships with patients and expressed feelings of belongingness, which resulted in experiences of both external and internal authenticity. Experiencing authenticity resulted in learning and understanding of nursing and students’ future professional role. In Study II, final-year students’ learning {{turned out to be more}} complex; they experienced only external authenticity, with feelings of ambivalence and self- centredness creating uncertainty as a threshold for their learning. Taking care of patients in need of extensive nursing care helped students overcome the threshold and experience internal authenticity as well. Study III explored student-patient encounters and showed that mutual relationships resulted in learning relationships, where patients were active participants in student learning. In Study IV, supervisors’ approaches to student learning were explored, and the supervisors’ role was shown to involve balancing patient care and student learning by having a nursing care plan for patients and a learning plan for students. Supervisors allowed students to have independence while giving them adequate support at the same time. To conclude, authenticity makes learning meaningful, and students need to experience both external and internal authenticity in their learning process. Patients’ <b>active</b> participation and <b>supervisors</b> giving both challenges and support are essential to students’ learning. An explicit pedagogical framework based on patient-centredness, peer-learning and supervisors working as a team creates prerequisites for experiences of external and internal authenticity. The present thesis points out that creating possibilities for experiencing authenticity should be the basis for designing clinical learning environments...|$|R

During thisperiod he adopted some {{innovative}} methodsfor the development of education in Orissa.Prior to his tenure of office, nobody could takeany significant steps for the promotion ofeducation from elementary level to University.The Britishers came to Orissa in 1803. Theindigenous system of education was thenprevalent in Orissa. The Wood's Despatch in1854 ushered {{a new era in}} the evolution ofBritish educational policy. The good ideas ofHarrison took definite shape with appointmentof T.E. Ravenshaw as the officiatingCommissioner of the Orissa Division in July1865.A large part of Orissa was under theCalcutta Presidency. T. E. Ravenshaw had taken keen interest for the progress of primary,secondary, technical and female education,which received greater attention than before.To popularise English education T.E.Ravenshaw, the officiating Commissioner ofOrissa Division proposed to raise the statusof the school from a Zilla school to a Collegiateschool by opening of college classes. In thebeginning the mode of teaching of villageschool teachers was primitive and in somerespects clumsy. Thus several important stepswere taken for the improvement of elementaryvillage schools. Afterwards the primaryeducation began to develop. In the same way anumber of prompt and <b>active</b> <b>supervisors</b> andcivil officers were appointed for properinspection of the schools.T.E. Ravenshaw actively supportedappointment of a separate Inspector for theOriya-medium schools. In order to supervisethe primary schools a Sub-Inspector wasappointed for each sub-division of a districtin 1872. The system of teaching graduallyimproved and systematically modified. Thus anumber of eminent Sub-Inspectors wererequired for the proper inspection of theeducational institutions.2Generally the schools were classifiedinto vernacular and Anglo-vernacular schoolsrespectively. Further they were classified inrespect of their management as (i) Governmentmanaged, (ii) Government aided etc. Heinstituted honour for teachers and rewards forsuccessful students. Special duties wereassigned to the inspecting body.In 1866 the [...] "Na Anka Durbhiksha" [...] sweptaway the lives of 30 lakhs people. Thecondition of education in Orissa was severelyaffected, The Cuttack Zilla school faced a lotT.E. Ravenshawand the Spread of Education in OrissaDinabandhu Dehury41Orissa Review * April - 2005of problems. Mr. W.Hunter an eminentInspector of Schools writes in his reports inthis respect:"The school suffered severely due to theNa Anka famine and 64% of students wereaffected". T.E. Ravenshaw the Commissionerof the Orissa Division compared the educationof the State with that of other states. He wrote"No other province in the Presidency was sodeficient of intelligent and public spiritedresidents who would appreciate the facts,bearing on the prospects and means of peopleand who could give practical information tothe authorities as would have been the case inany district of Bengal proper and in carryingout remedial measures."4T. E. Ravenshaw realised that thewomen education in Cuttack city was totallyneglected. The common people were notinterested to the growth of women education.They did not send their daughters to the schoolsbecause they had bad feelings. The story ofRevati high-lighted by Fakir Mohan explainedthe feelings of the people about the educationof their daughters. The Commissioner tookinitiatives for the growth of women educationin Orissa for the first time. A large amount offinancial assistance was sanctioned for thedevelopment of women education. The CuttackGirl's School was at the beginning started as aprimary school. But at last he financed for itsimprovement and spread of women educationin our State. In 1873, the name of this girlsschool was renamed as Ravenshaw HinduGirl's School.An important step towards thedevelopment of education in Orissa was takenwhen a medical school was established newlyat Cuttack. T.E. Ravenshaw, the Commissionerand Dr. W.D. Stewart, the Civil Surgeon ofCuttack both were interested for spread ofmedical education in Orissa. A huge amountof financial assistance was needed for itspromotion and expansion. Ravenshaw verykeenly recommended the sanction of the scheme.Thus the Government decided to start anesteemed institution on experimental basis. Hisactive action and skillful contribution to thisinstitution is always remembered in the historyof modern Orissa. At the beginning stage theGovernment sanctioned only 3,000 Rupees perannum for its improvement.6 The Governmenthighly appreciated the role of Dr. Stewart andRavenshaw for the initiative taken by them inthe establishment of this institution. He offeredhis free service to supervise and instruct thestudents. The people of the state were satisfiedand a large number of Oriya students were alsogetting facilities for higher education in Orissa.The saga of its birth, baptism and upbringingis nostalgic and reminds one of the sagaciousstewardship of a few worthy sons of Orissa aswell as benevolent Britishers whose sincereefforts and perseverance at different points oftime could make it see the light of the day. 7T.E. Raveshaw highly appreciated thedevoted and efficient services rendered to thefemale orphans by the Baptists. He was notonly duty- bound, but also sympathetic towardspoor, destitute pupils and respectful to thehigher authorities. He was a distinguishedadministrator of the Department of Educationand took keen interest in providing high qualityeducation in schools and colleges. After adedicated and self- sacrificed service for thespread of education for about 10 years in thisstate he left Orissa on 5th April 1878.8When T.E. Ravenshaw was theCommissioner of Orissa Division, the then,42Orissa Review * April - 2005Inspector of Schools, Mr. H.L.Harrison,appreciated his knack and definite work,agreed with the Committee and upgraded theZilla School into a Collegiate School. Theexcellent result of Cuttack Zilla School of 1865and 1866 prompted Mr. Hunter, the Inspectorof Schools to write: [...] "This standsunquestionably first among the educationalinstitutions of Orissa, having the largest numberof candidates at the entrance examinationcontrasted with the result obtained by schoolsdeserves unqualified praise, He concluded thatthe time had arrived for the promotion ofcollegiate education in Orissa." [...] 9The establishment of RavenshawCollege is the main contribution of T.E.Ravenshaw for the spread of higher educationin Orissa. At the beginning stage it was only asmall school. But this institution was convertedinto a full-f1edged first grade college. Thefamine of 1866 in which about a million peopleperished made the then Government consciousof the fact that the seriousness of the situationcould not be realised because of lack ofproper education in the state, There were onlysix students on the rolls in the B.A. Class, inRavenshaw College in 1875. The institutiongradually went ahead and provided inspirationto the upcoming intellectuals. When T.E.Ravenshaw was appointed as Commissionerof Orissa Division in July 1865, the educationsystem developed throughout Orissa. Lt.Governor of Bengal, Sir Richard Temple,agreed to open a college at Cuttack for thespread of higher education. Ravenshaw gavea memorandum to the authority for theestablishment of a degree college.l0 But the Lt.Governor agreed to the proposal on thecondition that a contribution of Rs.10,000 wasforthcoming from the public. The governmentsanctioned sufficient financial assistance forits improvement. In this connection Mr.Ravenshaw wrote, [...] "The establishment of acollege at Cuttack is an object of personalimportance to myself and also of greatestimportance to the spread of Higher Educationin Orissa."1 1The shaky foundation of the CuttackCollege was strengthened due to the sacrificeof a worthy son of the soil. The Maharaja ofMayurbhanj in 1879 had contributed Rs.20,000/-to the college. To perpetuate the memory ofRavenshaw, the then Commissioner of Orissafrom 1865 to 1878 for his univocal support toOriya as a separate language and for hismemorable service for the promotion ofwestern education in Orissa, the Maharajaproposed to change the name of the college toRavenshaw College.1 2T.E. Ravenshaw was instrumental increating numerous departments of varioussubjects in the Ravenshaw College. TheRavenshaw College buildings are highlyimpressive. The new building offeredaccommodation for all the college classes,there being an Arts Block, Chemistry, Physics,Botany, Zoology and Geography laboratoriesand a library erected through the donation ofthe Raja of Kanika, well known as [...] "KanikaLibrary".
