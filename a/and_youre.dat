60|$|BENTLEY. [helping {{him with}} the coat] Of course youre old. Look at your face and look at mine. What you call your youth is nothing but your levity. Why do we get on so well together?

50|$|The united German Empire proclaimed in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles in the {{aftermath}} of the Franco-Prussian War, followed its destiny, especially during the reign of William II, towards becoming a vast militaristic-industrial complex and simultaneously largely losing control of its own foreign policy. When the summer of 1914 saw the outbreak of the Great War, this was hailed with enthusiasm by the patriotic German public, <b>and</b> <b>theere</b> was no doubt that the course of events would echo those of the rapid victory of 1870. Felix Meyer was a fervent patriot whose spirit was undaunted by defeat or postwar conditions. The debts from his fatherâ€™s time were finally paid off, and the family and its business prospered. Rotawerke had branches in Belgium and France and business ties to Britain. Meyer was wealthy enough to support young artists.|$|R

60|$|BLANCO. Yes; but whats {{come of it}} all? Am I a {{real bad}} man? a man of game and grit? a man that does what he likes and goes over or through other people to his own gain? or am I a snivelling cry- baby that let a horse his life {{depended}} on be took from him by a woman, and then sat on the grass looking at the rainbow and let himself be took like a hare in a trap by Strapper Kemp: a lad whose back I or any grown man here could break against his knee?

60|$|JOHNNY [rising vengefully and {{following}} Bentley, who {{is forced to}} turn and listen] I'll {{tell you what it}} is, my boy: you want a good talking to; and I'm {{going to give it to}} you. If you think that because your father's a K.C.B., and you want to marry my sister, you can make yourself as nasty as you please and say what you like, youre mistaken. Let me tell you that except Hypatia, not one person in this house is in favor of her marrying you; and I dont believe shes happy about it herself. The match isnt settled yet: dont forget that. Youre on trial in the office because the Governor isnt giving his daughter money for an idle man to live on her. Youre on trial here because my mother thinks a girl should know what a man is like in the house before she marries him. Thats been going on for two months now; and whats the result? Youve got yourself thoroughly disliked in the office; <b>and</b> <b>youre</b> getting yourself thoroughly disliked here, all through your bad manners and your conceit, and the damned impudence you think clever.|$|E

Sound the Alarm was named after one {{of the songs}} on the album that, according to Conley, [...] "sums up the mood of the record." [...] Describing the theme of the album, Conley said it was [...] "desolation, like youre the last person standing after the apocalypse <b>and</b> <b>youre</b> alone <b>and</b> <b>youre</b> cold.

40|$|Clinical {{measurements}} of a horizontal cup/disc ratio were obtained among {{a sample of}} 160 normal twin subjects by stereoscopic biomicroscopy. Measurements of horizontal cup/disc ratio were normally distributed <b>and</b> <b>theere</b> was no significant association with sex, laterally, race, or refractive error in the mid-range. However, {{there was a significant}} association between size of the cup/disc ratio and age as well as intraocular pressure. After taking into account the correlation between age an intraocular pressure in normal eyes, the association between cup/disc ratio and each of these variable remained statistically significant. It is not always recoginized that the size of the normal physiological cup increases with age, and it was not previously observed that "normal" cupping occurs with age apart from the effect of pressure. The average effect of age on cup/disc ratio, amounting to an icrease of 0 - 0026 per year for this sample, is small. But, allowing for individual variation, some persons could show a recognizable acquired increase in cup/disc ration with age, {{even in the absence of}} glaucoma. The possibility of "normal"cupping occurring in association with age, pressure, or high myopia, alone or in combination, merits cosideration in the clinical evaluation of glaucoma suspects and serves to re-emphasize the importance of an adequate central visual field examination in the diagnosis of glaucoma. Studies are needed on the differentiatin between "normal" and "morbid" moulding of the optic nerve head...|$|R

5000|$|The first tip-off {{that the}} series was in trouble came early on when actress Josette DiCarlo, who {{originally}} portrayed Frankies mother in the pilot, was replaced by character-actress Camille Saviola.
