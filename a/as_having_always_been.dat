Much more would he be glad of similar collections referring to his father, mother, grandparents, and other near relatives. It would be peculiarly grateful to the young to possess likenesses of their parents and those whom they look upon as heroes, taken when they were of the same age as themselves.

5000|$|In recent years, the North End {{has become}} a popular {{destination}} for Halifax's growing university population. As the prices of apartments closer to Dalhousie University and Saint Mary's University continue to rise, and {{as the cost of}} transportation has fallen due to the introduction of the U-pass, students are finding cheaper accommodations in the North End. This has spawned a thriving artistic community, with many painters, musicians and writers being lured to this colourful section of the city.However, the North End is often linked to issues of crime and poverty. Its historic reputation as a largely blue collar, African Canadian, working class area remains in the minds of much of the local population, especially the older citizens. Hugh MacLennan, in his 1941 novel of the Halifax Explosion, Barometer Rising described the North End <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> [...] "Catholic and poor". Land use has been defined by the proximity of the CFB Halifax naval base and various adjunct facilities, as well as the Halifax Shipyard, the devastation of the 1917 explosion, all of which contributed to a now-aging stock of residential and commercial buildings that are typically smaller and of lower assessed value than other areas in the metropolitan region. Socio-economically, the devastation of the explosion and the military and industrial concentration in the neighbourhood saw a flight of the middle class to other exclusively residential undevastated neighbourhoods during the early 20th century, leading to a decline in the reputation of the North End.|$|E

40|$|Abstract ■ Strategic alterity {{is defined}} {{here as a}} process of {{shifting}} between different assertions of devalued group identity in order to valorize free-trading citizens of the market and to mask the labor of those making that free market participation possible (by moralizing the devalorization). The examples provided here – based on ethnographic, oral history, and archival research in an eastern Kentucky, US community – focus on the ways that different markers of identity have characterized the farmworkers providing the low-wage or non-wage labor in tobacco over the past two centuries that has made it possible for those whose crops they work in to see themselves as independent, family farmers. Tobacco is viewed, here, <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> a global crop produced by a ‘globalized ’ labor force. The ideological arguments, most recently neoliberal, justifying the differential power (and ‘market citizenship’) of farmers and farm-workers are examined within a US context, with suggestions for comparative and historical approaches to interpreting current strategies of inclusion and exclusion related to neoliberal capitalist globalization...|$|E
40|$|The {{body art}} of two {{contemporary}} American women artists [...] Janine Antoni's 1992 work Gnaw and Jenny Strauss's 1999 work Intake [...] provides {{ground for a}} discussion of orality in a postmodern feminist art context. Both works were made primarily through the act of biting, and both mimicked the eating disorder bulimia. Orality, as the stage in an infant's development when he/she negotiates independence from the mother and the outside world largely through biting and sucking, relates to the mother figure, the notion of the abject, and subjectivity development. The eating disorders of anorexia nervosa and bulimia also relate to orality, the mother-infant relationship, and food. Furthermore, the fasting practices of medieval women mystics substantiate a specific relationship that can exist between women and food in a patriarchal society. Through a discussion of all of these elements, the relationship between orality, food and women is revealed <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> a site of a complex social and political struggle and efficiency in relation to the mother and to the patriarchal order. For these contemporary artists, enlisting orality and mimicking the infantile state in their artworks has offered a way to address the mother-infant relationship as well as the socio-political underpinnings to women's relationship to food...|$|E
40|$|Entitled "Damage, Fear, and Transformation: International Currency Systems and Postwar Japan's Currency Policies," my {{dissertation}} {{sheds light}} on how economic damage/loss arouses fears of politicians, monetary authorities, economic experts, and business groups and how those fears can propel changes in the economic system. This can be seen through {{a case study of}} Japanese currency policy since 1945. We are accustomed to the paradigm that regards economic changes as largely the consequence of people's proactive and voluntary actions as embodied in entrepreneurship, challenge spirit, and profit-seeking, but my research shows that another large factor affecting the economic system is reactive actions driven by fear of losing accumulated wealth. Although researchers have examined the immense impact that damages and fear can cause to an economic system, they treated such damage and fear not as persistent factors but as temporary factors that emerged only during or after the time of emergency when the preexisting system became dysfunctional. In contrast, a proactive entrepreneurial spirit has been thought by many <b>as</b> <b>having</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> the engine of economic change from ancient times to the present. The reason the role of damage/loss and fear has been seen in such a limited way is that earlier studies mostly focused on realized economic damage, and not on the potential scale of unrealized economic damage and people's fear of it. This fear of potential economic damage has exerted a persistent influence on economic systems even in times of prosperity. What is potential economic damage? Potential economic damage expands in tandem with economic growth because we come to have more things to lose as we attain larger economic scale and property (scale of accumulation, transaction, etc.). And why does potential damage/loss consistently affect an economic system? As economic scale expands, the preexisting economic system gradually becomes unsuitable for the overgrown scale of the economy. Since such an unsustainable state destabilizes the containment of potential loss that has been growing along with economic expansion, the fear of losing accumulated wealth becomes increasingly widespread, leading both decision-makers and businesspeople to seek the fortification or transformation of the preexisting system. Demonstrating such a relationship, the dissertation argues that damage/loss and fear were not intermittent external causes, but consistent prime movers of economic change. To support the argument, the dissertation focuses on potential and realized losses related to currency, and their influence on the currency system, especially in Japan. Because a country's currency rate affects its products' overseas price and because trade had high importance for Japan, fear of economic damages that would result from a destabilization of the currency system and foreign exchange market attained massive proportions in Japan. Therefore, through the case of Japanese currency policy, we can relatively easily discern the interrelation between fear of potential/realized economic damage and systemic change. Specifically, the interrelation {{can be found in the}} following phases where potential economic damage and fear of it propelled Japanese politicians, monetary authorities, economic experts, and the business community to fortify the fixed exchange rate system until the early 1970 s, replace it with the floating exchange rate system between 1971 and 1973, and fortify the floating exchange rate system since 1974. To test this argument I have examined a large number of primary sources such as documents issued by the officials of the Japanese government and the central bank, as well as newspapers and economic magazines issued at each phase. Such extensive archival work confirmed that people's fear of potential economic damage/loss played a large role in defending or altering the preexisting currency system...|$|E
