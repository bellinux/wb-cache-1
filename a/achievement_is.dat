Items in the Work(s) column are items and companies that the winner created or worked at; they are meant to be representative of the winner's career in the field of fantasy to that point, but the World Fantasy Award for Life <b>Achievement</b> <b>is</b> not given for any specific achievement, and no such achievements are listed by the World Fantasy Convention as reasons for the award. In many cases the winner is well known for their non-fantasy works, such as science fiction novels, which are not listed.|$|E
5|$|Gasking {{asserted}} {{that the creation of}} the world is the most marvellous achievement imaginable. The merit of such an <b>achievement</b> <b>is</b> the product of its quality and the creator's disability: the greater the disability of the creator, the more impressive the achievement. Non-existence, Gasking asserts, would be the greatest handicap. Therefore, if the universe is the product of an existent creator, we could conceive of a greater being—one which does not exist. A non-existent creator is greater than one which exists, so God does not exist. Gasking's proposition that the greatest disability would be non-existence is a response to Anselm's assumption that existence is a predicate and perfection. Gasking uses this logic to assume that non-existence must be a disability.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{quasi-experimental}} research using factorial design. This study aimed at finding the facts that had been resulted from the different influence caused {{by the use of}} Open-Ended method and that of STAD method on the students’ mathematical problem-solving skills in terms of learning achievement. The learning <b>achievement</b> <b>was</b> categorized into two types namely the high achievement and the low achievement. The population in this study was Grade V students from SD Negeri Serayu. The data were analyzed by ANAVA univariate test. The results of the study were as follows. First, there have been differences in the mathematical problem-solving skills of the students who had been taught using Open-Ended method and those who had been taught using the STAD method. Second, there were also differences on the students’ score. For the students who had been taught using the Open-Ended method, the highest posttest average score of their learning <b>achievement</b> <b>was</b> 95. 71 while the lowest post-test average score of their learning <b>achievement</b> <b>was</b> 63. 92. These students’ total average score of learning <b>achievement</b> <b>was</b> 81. 04. On the other hand, for the students who had been taught using STAD the highest posttest average score of their learning <b>achievement</b> <b>was</b> 95. 50 while the lowest posttest average score of their learning <b>achievement</b> <b>was</b> 70. 00. These students’ total average score of learning <b>achievement</b> <b>was</b> 89. 13. Third, there has not been any differences between the Open-Ended method and the STAD method...|$|R

25|$|High <b>achievement</b> <b>is</b> {{attained}} {{through the}} use of consistent high performing schools practices (National Center for Education Achievement), a focus on the goals of the strategic plan, building action plans, and focus on core classroom practices.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with last}} year, the {{percentage}} of schools that earned below 60 declined by nearly 1 percent per Secretary of Education Carolyn Dumaresq.

25|$|The Need for <b>Achievement</b> <b>is</b> in {{many ways}} similar {{to the need for}} mastery and {{self-actualization}} in Maslow's hierarchy of needs and growth in the ERG theory. The achievement orientation has garnered more research interest as compared to the need for affiliation or power.|$|E
25|$|With {{the rise}} of Nazism many critics pointed to the flaws in the theory, repeating the {{arguments}} made by Sergi and others that the evidence of ancient Nordic <b>achievement</b> <b>is</b> thin when set against the civilizations of the Mediterranean and elsewhere. The equation of Nordic and Aryan identity was also widely criticized.|$|E
25|$|The {{process for}} {{determining}} admissions varies.

25|$|This album won Ronstadt a Grammy Award for Best Mexican-American Performance. The real achievement, however, is the disc's RIAA double-platinum (over {{two million}} copies {{sold in the}} U.S.) certification, making it the biggest-selling non-English-language album in U.S. music history.

25|$|U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan {{announced}} in March 2012, that the first-year data suggest student <b>achievement</b> <b>is</b> improving at campuses {{that participated in}} the federal School Improvement Grant program. He reported that at nearly 60 percent of SIG schools, more students are demonstrating proficiency in reading and math. Nearly a quarter of those schools reported math improvement in the double digits, and close to 20 percent of schools saw double-digit gains in reading.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} testing student <b>achievement</b> <b>is</b> not new, {{although}} the current Australian approach {{may be said}} to have its origins in current educational policy structures in both the USA and the UK. There are several key differences between the Australian NAPLAN and the UK and USA strategies.

25|$|In one {{specific}} case, white flight has significantly affected Sunset Junior High School {{in a suburb}} of the city of Rotorua, with the total number of students reduced from 700 to 70 in the early 1980s. All but one of the 70 students are Maori. The area has a concentration of poor, low-skilled people, with struggling families, and many single mothers. Related to the social problems of the families, student educational <b>achievement</b> <b>is</b> low on the standard reading test.|$|E
25|$|Notts County made up {{for this}} on 31 March 1894, when they won the FA Cup at Goodison Park, {{defeating}} Bolton Wanderers 4–1 in {{a game in which}} Jimmy Logan scored the second hat-trick in FA Cup final history. This <b>achievement</b> <b>is</b> also memorable for Notts County becoming the first club outside the top division to win the FA Cup: Notts County finished third in Division Two that season. In 1910 they moved to Meadow Lane.|$|E
50|$|Anno 1404 and its add-on Venice add the {{possibility}} of rewarding achievements to the player. Those <b>achievements</b> can <b>be</b> seen as 'milestones' and vary from quite easy to extremely hard, since {{a lot of them}} <b>are</b> 'hidden'. The <b>achievements</b> <b>are</b> divided in 5 categories: diplomacy, setup, economic, military and general. Quite a few of the <b>achievements</b> <b>are</b> interlinked, being part of another 'bigger' achievement. In the base game there <b>were</b> 206 <b>achievements</b> to <b>be</b> had, the Venice expansion added another 110 of them, totalling 316.However, as of patch 2.1/1.3 not all <b>achievements</b> <b>are</b> reachable, as syntax errors in the games' xml files are still present. Trying to correct these game files will result in the achievement not being awarded as the game recognises this as modification. This has been addressed by an unofficial user-made patch, about which see below.|$|R

25|$|Hoy's main <b>achievement</b> <b>is</b> his {{development}} in the individual sprint event {{considered to be the}} blue riband event of track cycling.
