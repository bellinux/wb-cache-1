40|$|Iron {{deficiency}} anemia (IDA) and <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> {{chronic disease}} {{are the most}} commonly confused anemias. We investigate the diagnostic value of erythrocyte indices, red cell volume distribution width, and serum ferritin levels to make differential diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>anemia</b> in controls and anemic patients. Iron deficiency anemia (44 patients), <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> chronic disease (41), IDA with <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> chronic disease (17) and control (50) groups were compared. We performed serum ferritin, CBC, and sedimentation rate in all patientsand bone marrow aspiration in patients with <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> chronic disease. Although mean cell volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) are low in IDA and <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> chronic disease, it is much striking in the former one (p< 0. 001, p< 0. 001). Only 7. 3 % <b>of</b> patients with <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> chronic disease had a MCV< 70 fL and MCH< 24 pg, 90. 0 % of patients with IDA were below that cut-off point. Serum ferritin means were in patients with IDA and <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> chronic disease were 4. 6 ± 3. 3 and 489. 6 ± 519. 9 ng/ml, respectively. The probability of IDA is low when RDW is normal in microcytic anemias. RDW is high in half <b>of</b> patients with <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> chronic disease.

40|$|<b>Anemia</b> <b>of</b> {{chronic disease}} is a hypoproliferative ane-mia that {{develops}} in response to systemic illness orinflammation. 1 It was first described in the 1930 s and was more fully characterized by Cartwright and Win-trobe in the 1950 s. 2 Although the second most prevalent af-ter anemia caused by iron deficiency, it is the commonest among patients with chronic illness. 3 A variety of clinical conditions can lead to <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> chronic disease, including infection, cancer and autoimmune conditions. In comprehensive population-based studies, precise esti-mates of prevalence are difficult to ascertain because many patients with anemia are not investigated sufficiently to estab-lish the cause. Moreover, no consensus research criteria exist for the diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> chronic disease, and patients may have multifactorial causes for <b>anemia,</b> wherein <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> chronic disease is only a part. <b>Anemia</b> <b>of</b> chronic disease varies in severity.

40|$|Past {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that iron deficiency anemia is related to deficits in cognitive fucntioning in children, and treating iron deficiency anemia with iron supplementation can improve cognition. <b>Anemia</b> <b>of</b> inflammation is another type <b>of</b> <b>anemia</b> caused by many diseases of lesser-developed countries including bacterial and parasitic infections. <b>Anemia</b> <b>of</b> inflammation is characterized by disordered iron metabolism, such that iron is sequestered in storage forms, preventing its use from tissues that require it. We hypothesized that decreased iron delivery to the brain in the context <b>of</b> <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> inflammation might lead to decreased cognitive performance. This study found that children with <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> inflammation had decreased cognitive performance in specific domains, compared to subjects with no anemia. True total body iron deficiency anemia was related to lower performance in the same domains. The only treatment option for <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> inflammation is treatment of the underlying disease. Iron supplementation will not prevent cognitive deficits in children with <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> inflammation. Interventions aimed towards maximizing the cognitive development of children in lesser-developed countries will need to focus on the prevention and treatment of bacterial and parasitic infections...|$|R

40|$|Objective. We {{assess and}} compare the {{efficacy}} <b>of</b> <b>anemia</b> treatment in pregnant women with <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> chronic disease with true iron deficiency and in women with iron deficiency anemia. Study Design. Fifty patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin 8. 0 – 9. 9 [*]g/dl) and iron deficiency (ferritin < 15 [*]μg/l) were treated in the Anemia Clinic at the Department of Obstetrics. Results. All patients showed stimulation of erythropoiesis as evidenced {{by an increase in}} reticulocyte count at day eight of therapy and showed an increase in hemoglobin and hematocrit at the end of therapy (p< 0. 001). The target hemoglobin (≥ 10. 5 [*]g/dl) was achieved in 45 / 50 women (90 %). 12 patients showed <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> chronic disease with true iron deficiency (12 / 50; 24 %). Seven women (7 / 12; 59 %) with <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> chronic disease and iron deficiency responded well to anemia treatment. 50 % <b>of</b> women with <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> chronic disease and iron deficiency (3 / 6) responded well to intravenous iron, and 67 % (4 / 6) responded well to the combination of intravenous iron and recombinant human erythropoietin.

MethodsPeripheral blood cells from 117 adult patients with anemia were classified according to iron status, inflammation, and hemoglobinopathies as: iron deficiency anemia (n= 42), <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> chronic disease (n= 28), <b>anemia</b> <b>of</b> chronic disease associated with iron deficiency anemia (n= 22), and heterozygous β-thalassemia (n= 25). The percentage of microcytic erythrocytes, hypochromic erythrocytes, and the levels of hemoglobin in both reticulocytes and mature red cells were determined.
