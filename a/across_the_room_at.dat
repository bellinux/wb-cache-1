25|$|Merman was {{notorious for}} her brash {{demeanour}} and for telling vulgar stories at public parties. For instance, she once shouted a dirty joke <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> José Ferrer during a formal reception.|$|E
500|$|The {{first song}} {{featured}} in the episode is [...] "The Most Beautiful Girl (In the Room)." [...] The song, also known as [...] "Part-Time Model", {{was based on the}} conceit of a man [...] "who's not very good at compliments." [...] The song begins after Jemaine sees Sally from <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> Dave's party. Jemaine details his seduction of Sally, describing her as being so beautiful she could be a [...] "part-time model". This song was voted number 60 in the 2008 Triple J Hottest 100. [...] Later, the song was nominated for an Emmy award for Outstanding Original Music And Lyrics.|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} on May 10, 1993 that The Who's Tommy had received eleven Tony Award nominations, tying with Kiss of the Spider Woman {{for the most}} nominations that year. Gaven received a nomination in the [...] "Best Featured Actress in a Musical" [...] category. However, {{as the result of}} an allergic reaction, she could not perform in the musical some nights. When Daryl Miller interviewed Gaven in the Los Angeles Times in 1997, he noted that [...] "this {{was one of the biggest}} disappointments of her life, and clouds cross her face for the first time in the conversation. She glances <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> the Tony citation—recognizing her nomination for best featured actress in a musical—as she describes how her throat became infected due to a reaction to the oil in a haze-making compound that designers pump onstage to enhance lighting effects. She missed a lot of performances, and an untold number of Tony voters missed her performance. She can't help but wonder how that affected the outcome." [...] At one point, Gaven's understudy Alice Ripley took her place for eight consecutive weeks while Gaven recovered. Gaven eventually had to leave The Who's Tommy some months after it opened because of her allergy. She also disliked the idea of performing in one musical for more than a year.|$|E
60|$|Madame {{put down}} her fork, but kept her knife in her hand. She looked <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> not <b>at</b> Miss Pinnegar.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bundercombe glanced <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and <b>at</b> {{that moment}} the girl noticed him. She bowed and waved her hand. Mr. Bundercombe responded gallantly.|$|R
60|$|He walked <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{artificial}} flowers, and the rose-colored soap, {{and again}} {{went to the}} table and took up the two books.|$|R
60|$|She glanced <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> him, half curiously, half scornfully.|$|E
60|$|Phoebe looked <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> Mrs. Sowler, still nodding {{over the}} fire.|$|E
60|$|Richard neither heeded nor heard him. His dim {{eyes still}} looked <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> Clara and Frank.|$|E
6000|$|He looked <b>at</b> her accomplishment, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> as <b>at</b> some striking, some charming phenomenon. [...] "Well, that's {{the sort}} of thing I want!" [...] All the ripe candour of his eyes {{confirmed}} it.|$|R
6000|$|NAPOLEON. Eh? (He {{takes it}} {{and looks at}} it attentively.) Hm! (He smells it.) Ha! (He walks thoughtfully <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> handkerchief, which he finally sticks in the breast of his coat.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Mrs. Hampton—” began Leonard with {{increased}} solemnity, {{but he got}} no further. A breath of chill air seemed to rush <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time the macaws broke forth into ear-splitting screams.|$|R
60|$|Herbert, from a head {{slightly}} stooping, gazed {{back in an}} almost birdlike fashion <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> his visitor.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Lind's eyes lighted. [...] "Is that he?" [...] she whispered, glancing curiously <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> him. [...] "Bring him and {{introduce}} him to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|Presently he relaxes {{and leans}} back, and blinks through his smoke <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> things {{invisible}} to other eyes. [...] "Full of secrets," [...] he says. [...] "Wonderful secrets!" ...|$|E
30|$|In {{a typical}} {{commercial}} building, spaces are either private (such as offices) or shared (such as cafeteria, corridor), {{and a set}} of private and shared spaces constitutes a zone. Within each zone, there exists a VAV unit that takes air from AHU at a particular temperature (u(t)) and supplies it <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>at</b> a specific rate (vij(t)) to maintain <b>the</b> <b>room</b> temperature close to the set point temperature. Here, j indicates <b>the</b> <b>room</b> number in <b>the</b> ith zone of the building. To ensure a consistent supply of fresh air, AHU recirculates only a limited amount of used air (r(t)) and ejects the remaining air in the open environment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good then." [...] They {{had been}} moving {{by this time}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door, before passing out, they paused as for the full wind-up of their understanding. [...] "I'll watch with you," [...] said May Bartram.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go for the doctor, Tom! lose not a moment," [...] said Miss Ophelia; and, {{stepping}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> she rapped <b>at</b> St. Clare's door.|$|R
60|$|The Count de Brensault was nonplussed. He {{looked at}} Jeanne, {{and he looked}} vaguely <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> the Princess, as though {{wondering}} whether he ought to appeal to her.|$|E
60|$|Lord Arranmore laughed, and Brooks looked <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> him in amazement. The Marquis {{was always}} pale, but his pallor just then was as unnatural as the laugh itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{not making}} a speech, dear," [...] the Duchess remarked, looking coldly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> him. [...] "We are all anxious {{to hear what the}} Prince has to say to us." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{strove to}} loosen himself from her grasp, {{but he was}} powerless. Nevertheless he got a little nearer to the door. Forrest came swiftly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Engleton struck <b>at</b> him with a chair, but the blow was harmless.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an {{interior}} {{view of the}} Eagle Nest Hunting Lodge, Catalina Island, January 14, 1928. Eight people sit in wooden chairs <b>across</b> <b>the</b> living <b>room</b> <b>at</b> center while a boy sits on a fur rug next to the fire on the right. Two thick logs held by chains hang over the group while stuffed goat heads hang from the surrounding walls. Light shines in from three nearby windows...|$|R
60|$|In <b>the</b> next <b>room</b> Sam {{sat down}} to study. Tom had wanted to study, too, but his brother had persuaded him to lie down and rest, {{and now he was}} asleep and {{breathing}} heavily. Sam tiptoed his way <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> to gaze <b>at</b> him.|$|R
60|$|Archie did not reply. He {{was staring}} glassily <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> {{two men who}} had just come in. One was a large, stout, square-faced man of {{commanding}} personality. The other was Mr. Daniel Brewster.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is too late." [...] With that answer, {{she looked}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> the child, still {{waiting by the}} door. [...] "Come, Elfie," [...] she said, calling the little {{creature}} by {{one of her favorite}} nicknames. [...] "Come to bed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{there is}} a woman, is there?" [...] she went on, looking <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> her companion. [...] "Have you {{committed}} yourself already, then? Don't you remember what I told you the first night we met after the opera--that it is well to wait?" ...|$|E
50|$|In their Hellmouth lair, Collin {{consoles}} the Master for {{his loss}} of Darla at Angel's hands. Spying Angel <b>across</b> <b>the</b> crowded <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bronze, Buffy goes {{to thank him}} — and to tell him goodbye. Their banter trails to silence and they deeply kiss one last time. Buffy doesn't notice that the cross she's wearing — the one Angel gave her weeks ago at their first meeting — was scorching his chest.|$|R
50|$|At the ACS dinner, Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) {{introduces}} Don and Megan to Ed Baxter (Ray Wise), Ken’s father-in-law. Ed compliments Don's {{talent and}} Megan's {{contribution to the}} Heinz campaign. Roger tells Sally about the event's attendees as Marie watches him from <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Later <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bar, Marie tells Roger he should get everything he wants. Meanwhile, Emile tells Megan she has changed, that her love for Don has impeded her own future. Sally later enters a <b>room</b> down <b>the</b> hall and sees Marie fellating Roger.|$|R
6000|$|Buddha {{moved slowly}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Arrived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{sideboard}} the astral figure paused, {{and even in}} the uncertain light Buddha was seen to raise and drink the propitiatory offering. That much was perfectly clear. Whether Buddha spoke or not is doubtful. Certain of the spectators thought that he said, 'Must a fagotnit', which is Hindustanee for [...] "Blessings on this house." [...] To Mrs. Rasselyer-Brown's distracted mind it seemed as if Buddha said, [...] "I must have forgotten it" [...] But this wild fancy she never breathed to a soul.|$|R
60|$|The man {{laid his}} hat upon the table. Maraton, glancing <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> him, was {{instantly}} conscious that this newcomer {{was no ordinary}} person. He had a strong, intellectual forehead, a well-shaped mouth. His voice, when he spoke, was pleasant, although his accent was peculiar--almost foreign.|$|E
6000|$|His mother held up {{a warning}} finger. [...] "Hush!" [...] she whispered. He shrank away from her {{as she tried to}} take him on her knee, and looked <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> his father. [...] "More!" [...] he burst out louder than ever. Romayne beckoned to me, and pointed to the boy.|$|E
6000|$|... "John Strangewey!" [...] {{she murmured}} to herself, glancing <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> the family tree. [...] "It is really curious how that name {{brings with it}} a sense of familiarity. It is so unusual, too. And what an unusual-looking person! Do you think, Aline, that you ever saw any one so superbly handsome?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Ullman {{says that}} Kay {{is based on}} a woman who worked at her bank in England. [...] "Basically, she's forty-three, has never been touched by a man and never will be. There's always one like her in every office who sells {{sanitary}} napkins and stamps, with her nice polyester ass waddling <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Once, <b>at</b> an office party, someone got her behind the filing cabinets, and he's never lived it down. People go, 'Oh, you and Kayyy - 1982....' 'Shut up! I never did nothing with her!' I love people like that." ...|$|R
60|$|A single chord {{of music}} in a minor key floated <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> soft <b>at</b> first, {{swelling}} later into a volume of sound, then dying away and ceasing altogether. John, standing momentarily alone {{in a corner of}} the picture-gallery, found it almost incredible that this wildly hilarious throng of men and women could so soon, and without a single admonitory word, break off in the midst of their conversation, stifle their mirth, almost hold their breath, in obedience to this unspoken appeal for silence. Every light in the place was suddenly extinguished. There remained only the shaded lamps overhanging the pictures.|$|R
60|$|TIMSON. [Disagreeably surprised.] Certainly; {{never make}} bones {{about a little}} extra--never 'ave in all me life. Do it at onsh, I will. [He moves <b>across</b> to <b>the</b> model's <b>room</b> <b>at</b> that {{peculiar}} broad gait so perfectly adjusted to his habits.] You quite understand me --couldn't bear to 'ave anything on me that wasn't mine.|$|R
