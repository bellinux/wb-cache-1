40|$|<b>Additional</b> <b>expert</b> {{assistance}} {{is intended for}} overcoming deficiencies, offering learning assistance and counselling. It also helps develop {{the functioning of the}} pupils, thereby improving their success and independence. However, to achieve positive results of such assistance, a number of criteria need to be met. The school must ensure experts, premises and accessories. It is also vital that both children with special needs and their peers have a good understanding of and experience with <b>additional</b> <b>expert</b> assistance. If children with special needs perceive <b>additional</b> <b>expert</b> assistance as a solid support of their education, they will become more successful. Their peers are also important in this respect, which is why they must understand and grasp the significance of expert assistance. This research was based on a survey in order to explore the experience and understanding of <b>additional</b> <b>expert</b> assistance. The empirical part of the thesis analysed the experience and understanding of <b>additional</b> <b>expert</b> assistance among pupils with special needs and their peers. The sample involved 24 pupils with special needs and 173 pupils without special needs who are attending three elementary schools in the vicinity of Kranj. The data was collected through two survey questionnaires that were designed specifically for this research. They contained 16 closed-ended and semi-open questions. The results indicated that pupils with special needs normally like the lessons with <b>additional</b> <b>expert</b> assistance, although they often feel embarrassed in front of their peers. Nevertheless, both groups of pupils showed adequate understanding of <b>additional</b> <b>expert</b> assistance. Based on other pieces of research and my own experience, I expected more statistically significant differences between their answers (pupils, pupils with special needs, girls, boys, younger and older pupils). That was only the case in one question where the girls knew more peers with special needs than boys. ...|$|R

40|$|Artistic {{teaching}} tools {{included in}} the process of education increase the efficiency of traditional learning methods. They help pupils to be more open, relaxed and motivated. They enable presenting information easier, which is especially important for pupils with learning difficulties. Puppets present one such tool. By including them in the educational process, puppets can affect different areas of a child's development and can {{play an important role in}} <b>additional</b> <b>expert</b> pedagogical support. They help achieve general and specific objectives {{in the process of}} education set out individually for each pupil with learning difficulties, since they offer a more creative, more interesting and less stressful style of learning. Puppets can affect the emotional, cognitive and social development of pupils and enable their integrated development as well. In the empirical part of the thesis, the frequency and the aim of the use of puppets in <b>additional</b> <b>expert</b> pedagogical support were researched as well as teachers' opinions on the use of puppets, their acquaintance with their use, factors affecting their use and reasons for not using them very often. An internet survey was conducted and analysed with the help of a programme for statistical analysis SPSS. The results are presented in tabular form, in graphs and descriptively. The sample of persons participating comprises special education teachers in Slovenian primary schools. Besides the results of the research, the thesis also presents the activities that included puppets as well as the objectives of the curriculum and of individualised programmes achieved by them on the basis of personal experiences in <b>additional</b> <b>expert</b> pedagogical support. Research findings show that special education teachers generally welcome the use of puppets in <b>additional</b> <b>expert</b> pedagogical support but do not use them frequently, usually because of lack of knowledge and ideas on the one hand and work overload and time shortage on the other. The puppets they mostly use at their work are hand puppets and puppets as toys, and as a learning method, they mostly use storytelling and communication through the puppet as the media. They mostly use them with children with specific learning difficulties in the first and second triad (age of pupils: from 6 to 11 years), and the frequency of their use is closely connected to various activities, methods and forms of work. They assess puppets as especially useful tool at helping pupils express their thoughts and feelings, at encouraging their imagination, and speech and communication development. Special education teachers are willing to participate at training courses on the use of puppets since they suggest seminars, workshops and trainings on various possibilities of the use of puppets, presentations of best practices in schools and study groups, publishing of the manual and opening of the Internet site on the use of puppets in the educational process, and professional help to special education teachers at their work. They also suggest introducing puppets as a compulsory university subject, and creating of didactic suitcase with various puppets. The presentation of the use of puppets in the programme of <b>additional</b> <b>expert</b> pedagogical support highlights the factors that affect the frequency of the use of puppets and at the same time suggests the guidelines for more frequent use by special education teachers. The fundamental contribution of this thesis relates to enrichment of the working methods in <b>additional</b> <b>expert</b> pedagogical support for children with specific learning difficulties and consequently the enrichment of the curriculum in primary schools. ...|$|R

5000|$|The CPT {{was founded}} {{on the basis of}} the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1987), which came into force in February 1989. It allows the CPT to visit all [...] "places of detention" [...] of the member states of the Council of Europe. Places of detention, as defined by the convention, are all places in which people are held without their consent. In the first place, this covers police cells, jails, prisons and closed {{psychiatric}} institutions, but also immigration detention centres, old peoples homes and the like. The visits are carried out by small teams of CPT members, who usually call in <b>additional</b> <b>experts.</b> After each visit, a report about the findings and recommendations is drawn up and sent to the respective government. The findings deal not so much with individual cases of torture but with the identification of situations at risk that may lead to torture. The CPT reports are confidential and are be published only if the government so requests. But political pressure on the governments is strong to make the report public. Only in the rare case in which governments refuse to publish and the CPT has clear evidence of a practice of torture, the CPT may make a unilateral [...] "public statement".|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To describe, {{validate}} {{and demonstrate}} an approach for knowledge base construction based on expert opinions. METHODS: A knowledge base containing {{the frequency of}} occurrence of manifestations in epileptic seizures is constructed based on information provided by neurologists/epileptologists. The reliability of the responses is determined with the inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). If the ICC is not large enough the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula {{can be used to}} predict the number of <b>additional</b> <b>experts.</b> We propose a method to assess whether an additional expert provides information consistent with the already acquired data as well as a method to detect experts with deviating opinions. The power of the first method was determined. RESULTS: Data were collected for five seizure types. The ICCs determined from the responses for the various seizure types after inclusion of the <b>additional</b> <b>experts</b> was in all cases almost equal to 0. 9, the target value. Yet one expert with diverging opinions concerning the frequency of occurrence of manifestations for different seizure types could be identified. Excluding this participant improved the reliability of the data. The power of the methods was good (> or = 0. 75). CONCLUSIONS: It is shown that human experts can provide reliable information about the frequency of occurrence of manifestations in epileptic seizures. In addition, the described approach correctly identified neurologists/epileptologists with both consistent and diverging opinions about the frequency of occurrence of manifestations in a number of seizure types...|$|E
