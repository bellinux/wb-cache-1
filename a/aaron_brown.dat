25|$|Meanwhile, a {{scientist}} at the Tower named Dr. Imran Zere (Roger <b>Aaron</b> <b>Brown),</b> who was attempting to develop a cure for the virus, is kidnapped by Rais, prompting Crane to attempt a rescue mission. Crane is also captured by Rais, who reveals that the file he stole contains proof that the GRE intends to weaponize the virus rather than develop a cure and releases the file to the public. Crane manages to escape before being executed, and, in the process, cuts off Rais' hand. Dr. Zere is killed in the rescue attempt, but manages to tell Crane that he had entrusted his research to Jade, who is tasked with delivering it to another scientist named Dr. Allen Camden (Dan Gilvezan). As Crane goes to look for Jade, he finds out that the Defence Ministry is planning to bomb Harran {{in an effort to}} completely eradicate the outbreak, claiming that there are no survivors left in the city. He manages to reactivate a radio tower and broadcasts a message to the outside world, thwarting the Ministry's plan. Jade is captured by Rais, who also steals Dr. Zere's research. Crane manages to rescue Jade and recover a part of Dr. Zere's research, but Jade admits that she has been bitten, and pleads with Crane to stop Rais. Jade then succumbs to the wound, forcing Crane to mercifully kill her, also by snapping her neck. After killing Rais' second-in-command, Tahir (Michael Benyaer) with his own machete, Crane delivers the tissue samples to Dr. Camden, who believes that he is very close to the cure, but needs the rest of Dr. Zere's data. Crane then finds out that Rais has cut a deal with the GRE, in which he will hand over Dr. Zere's research data to them in return for extraction from Harran. Crane then assaults Rais' headquarters (filled with infected) and battles him atop a skyscraper, just as a GRE helicopter shows up, eventually stabbing Rais in the neck and throwing him off the building. He narrowly recovers the research data and decides to turn it over to Dr. Camden instead of the GRE, intending to stay in Harran to help the remaining survivors.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} Colbert portrays in Report originated as an amplification of his self-important Daily Show correspondent. As {{they developed}} {{the character and}} the show Colbert and his staff began {{to look at some}} more specific models. Bill O'Reilly, whom the character affectionately nicknames [...] "Papa Bear", is the most commonly cited point of reference. In a 2006 episode of The Colbert Report, Colbert remarked that, [...] "if it wasn't for , this show wouldn’t exist". In adapting the character for the Report, Colbert has also mentioned <b>Aaron</b> <b>Brown,</b> Anderson Cooper, Sean Hannity, Lou Dobbs and Joe Scarborough as having an influence over his performance. References to the character's abuse of prescription drugs are believed to be an allusion to Rush Limbaugh's addiction to painkillers.|$|E

500|$|Due {{to their}} lackluster 2013 performance, the Phillies had the seventh first-round {{pick in the}} June 5–7 MLB draft. They {{selected}} Aaron Nola, a starting pitcher from Louisiana State University predicted {{by many to be}} one of the first draft picks to reach the major leagues, for fast-tracking through the Phillies' minor-league system. In the second round, they selected another pitcher – lefthander Matt Imhof, who played college ball with the Cal Poly Mustangs – and selected <b>Aaron</b> <b>Brown,</b> a pitcher-outfielder from Pepperdine, in the third round. The Phillies changed their organizational draft philosophy from drafting unpolished players with potential to selecting players ready to contribute to the big-league club, picking only one high-school player in the first 28 rounds. Michael Baumann wrote on the Crashburn Alley blog, [...] "Given how high the Phillies drafted and how bad their farm system is at the top, I wanted them to get back into the game with one swing. This draft won’t do that, but generally you want to get at least one good major league player out of every draft class, plus some odds and ends." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} part of the 2007–08 season, {{speculation}} began to mount that Stimson would be approached to take over as manager of a Football League club, with Gillingham, Port Vale and Millwall all alleged to be interested in his services. He was offered a new contract by Stevenage on 16 October 2007, but resigned the following day. On 1 November, he was appointed as the new manager of Gillingham, and quickly moved to sign a number of Stevenage players, including Adam Miller and John Nutter. He was unable to recreate his previous success, however, and at the end of the 2007–08 season Gillingham were relegated from League One. [...] He was also criticised by departing player <b>Aaron</b> <b>Brown,</b> who acknowledged that Stimson had strong coaching skills but described his man-management as [...] "shocking". The following season the Gills finished fifth in League Two and beat Shrewsbury Town 1–0 in the play-off Final at Wembley Stadium to gain promotion, but in the 2009–10 season Gillingham were relegated back to League Two, after which Stimson's contract was terminated [...] "by mutual consent" [...] on 10 May 2010.|$|E
