5|$|McGovern {{announced}} his candidacy on January 18, 1971, during a televised speech {{from the studios}} of KELO-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. At the time of his announcement, McGovern ranked fifth <b>among</b> <b>Democrats</b> in a presidential preference Gallup Poll. The earliest such entry since Andrew Jackson was designed to give him time to overcome the large lead of the front-runner, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie. Nevertheless, by January 1972, McGovern had only 3percent national support <b>among</b> <b>Democrats</b> in the Gallup Poll and had not attracted significant press coverage.|$|E
5|$|Governor Breathitt died of {{tuberculosis}} on February 21, 1834, and Morehead {{was sworn in}} as governor the following day. The replacement of a Democratic governor with one from the rival National Republican party caused a great deal of angst <b>among</b> <b>Democrats,</b> but the ascendancy of Democrat James Guthrie to president of the state senate and Morehead's willingness to retain Breathitt's secretary of state, Lewis Saunders, did much to allay their fears.|$|E

5|$|As {{a treaty}} {{document}} {{with a foreign}} nation, the Tyler-Texas annexation treaty required {{the support of a}} two-thirds majority in the Senate for passage. But in fact, when the Senate voted on the measure on June 8, 1844, fully two-thirds voted against the treaty (16–35). The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted overwhelmingly in favor (15–8). The election campaign had hardened partisan positions on Texas <b>among</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Tyler had anticipated that the measure would fail, due largely to the divisive effects of Secretary Calhoun's Packenham letter. Undeterred, he formally asked the House of Representatives to consider other constitutional means to authorize passage of the treaty. Congress adjourned before debating the matter.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's volunteers {{responded to}} {{requests}} for military service {{in the early months}} of the war; however, as the war progressed and the number of casualties increased, the state government had to resort to conscription (the draft) to fill its quotas. Military conscription, which began in October 1862, was a divisive issue within the state. It was especially unpopular <b>among</b> <b>Democrats,</b> who viewed it as a threat to individual freedom and opposed legislation that allowed a man to purchase an exemption for $300 or pay another person to serve as his substitute. A total of 3,003 Hoosier men were drafted in October 1862; subsequent drafts in Indiana brought the total to 17,903.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} Louisville Democrats, {{supporters}} of U. S. Senator Jo Blackburn, {{made the first}} formal calls for a new convention. A short time after, a large meeting at Mount Sterling gave the movement a definite form. They called for a meeting in Lexington on August 2 to organize {{the details of a}} new convention. At subsequent mass meetings, it was announced that former governor John Y. Brown would accept the nomination of a second convention, should one be held. As Brown had been thought to be a supporter of Goebel, this announcement caused no small stir <b>among</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Representatives of sixty counties attended the August 2 meeting in Lexington. Resolutions endorsing the Democratic platform from the 1896 Democratic National Convention and the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan in 1900 were adopted. Then, ex-governor Brown addressed the crowd. Finally, the representatives agreed to a nominating convention to be held on August 16.|$|E

5|$|Post {{election}} {{polls showed}} that Humphrey lost the white vote with 38%, nine points behind Nixon, but won the nonwhite vote solidly, 85% to 12%, including 97% of African-Americans. African-Americans favored Humphrey {{because of his}} record on civil rights, and their desire to quickly end the war in Vietnam, where blacks were overrepresented. The racial divide in the election had widened since 1964, and was attributed to civil rights protests and race riots. Humphrey won 45% of the female vote, two points ahead of Nixon, but lost to the Republican among males, 41% to 43%. Voters with only a grade school education supported Humphrey 52% to 33% over Nixon, while Nixon won among both those with no higher education than high school (43% to 42%) and those who graduated from college (54% to 37%). Occupation demographics mirrored these numbers with manual-labor workers supporting Humphrey 50% to 37%, and with white-collar (47% to 41%) and professionals (56% to 34%) favoring Nixon. Humphrey won among young voters (under 30 years old) by 47% to 38%, and also edged Nixon among those between 30 and 49 years, with 44% to 41%. Nixon won among voters over 50 years, 47% to 41%. Catholics backed Humphrey with 59%, twelve points ahead of Nixon, but Protestants favored Nixon, 49% to 35%. Humphrey lost the Independent vote 31% to 44%, with 25% going to Wallace, and won a lower percentage <b>among</b> <b>Democrats</b> (74%) than Nixon won among Republicans (86%). This discrepancy {{was connected to the}} tough Democratic primary election that caused some former McCarthy, Kennedy or McGovern supporters to vote for Nixon or Wallace as a protest.|$|E

25|$|According to Gallup Polls from June 9 to August 17 McCain's cross-party support fluctuated between 10% and 13%. In {{the poll}} for August 18 to August 24 support for McCain <b>among</b> <b>Democrats</b> peaked at 14%. From October 13 to October 19 polls showed McCain's support <b>among</b> <b>Democrats</b> to be 7%, {{which was the}} lowest thus far. The CNN exit polls placed his Democratic support at 10% with the same {{percentage}} for liberal support. These results may not represent the general voters due to early voting.|$|E

Rendell addressed this issue in later speeches, saying that he opposes social security privatization, and that his previous comments were meant to show admiration for President Bush for taking on a politically risky subject. Nevertheless, Rendell's initial statements cost him support <b>among</b> <b>Democrats</b> who are against Social Security privatization.|$|E
25|$|Blunt's {{first year}} in office was difficult, and he was criticized by both the right and the left.

His approval among Republicans polled was 62%, but his rating <b>among</b> <b>Democrats</b> was only 12%. This {{was one of the greatest}} partisan divides of any governor.|$|E

25|$|Gregoire won Washington's {{first ever}} top two primary on August 19, 2008 with 49%. She {{advanced}} to the general election against Dino Rossi.

There was a marked geographical split in the 2008 election: the more populous and Democratic-leaning Western Washington counties supported Gregoire, whilst the less populous and more Republican-leaning Eastern Washington counties supported Rossi.|$|E
25|$|Voter {{turnout was}} at {{historically}} high {{levels in the}} 2008 primaries and caucuses, with many contests setting all-time records for turnout. Voter turnout on Super Tuesday was at 27% of eligible citizens, breaking the previous record of 25.9% set in 1972. Turnout was higher <b>among</b> <b>Democrats</b> than Republicans, with Democratic turnout surpassing Republican turnout even in traditionally red states where the number of registered Democrats is proportionally low.

From January 3 through February 5, Democratic turnout exceeded Republican turnout, 19.1 million to 13.1 million.|$|E
25|$|When {{it became}} clear that Mexico would not stand for this kind of an agreement, some critics from the labor {{movement}} would not settle for any viable alternatives. In response, part of the labor movement wanted to declare their open opposition to the agreement, and to push for NAFTA's rejection in Congress. Ultimately, the ambivalence of labor groups led those within the Administration who supported NAFTA to believe that strengthening NAFTA's labor side agreement too much would cost more votes among Republicans than it would garner <b>among</b> <b>Democrats,</b> and would make it harder for the United States to elicit support from Mexico.|$|E

25|$|The {{potential}} {{need for}} a JohnsonKennedy ticket was ultimately eliminated by the Republican nomination of conservative Barry Goldwater. With Goldwater as his opponent, Johnson's choice of vice president was all but irrelevant; opinion polls had revealed that, while Kennedy was an overwhelming first choice <b>among</b> <b>Democrats,</b> any choice made less than a 2% difference {{in a general election}} that already promised to be a landslide. When attempts to ease Kennedy out of the running failed, Johnson searched for a way to eliminate him with minimal party discord, and eventually announced that none of his cabinet members would be considered for the position. Kennedy instead mounted a successful run for United States Senate in New York.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic Party is {{supportive}} of LGBT rights. Most support for same-sex {{marriage in the}} United States has come from Democrats, although some favor civil unions instead or oppose same-sex marriage. Support for same-sex marriage has increased {{in the past decade}} according to ABC News. An April 2009 ABC News/Washington Post public opinion poll put support <b>among</b> <b>Democrats</b> at 62%, while a June 2008 Newsweek poll found that 42% of Democrats support same-sex marriage while 23% support civil unions or domestic partnership laws and 28% oppose any legal recognition at all. A broad majority of Democrats have supported other LGBT-related laws such as extending hate crime statutes, legally preventing discrimination against LGBT people in the workforce, and repealing Don't ask, don't tell. A 2006 Pew Research Center poll of Democrats found that 55% supported gays adopting children with 40% opposed while 70% support gays in the military with only 23% opposed. Gallup polling from May 2009 stated that 82% of Democrats support open enlistment.|$|E
25|$|Taylor was {{a member}} of the Blue Dog Coalition, and his voting record was one of the most {{conservative}} <b>among</b> <b>Democrats</b> in the House. He has become a leading Democratic Member of the House Armed Services Committee. He led committee and floor fights to improve the medical benefits of military retirees, and to extend TRICARE health insurance to members of the National Guard and Reserves. Taylor also has focused on U.S. policy in Latin America, sponsoring the successful cap on the number of U.S. troops that can be sent to Colombia without explicit Congressional authorization. Taylor also was a leading critic of the Base Realignment and Closure process, accusing the Department of Defense of smuggling in policy changes that were unrelated to excess capacity or facilities. Taylor served as the Ranking Democrat on the Projection Forces Subcommittee in the 109th Congress, and became chairman of the renamed Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces in the 110th Congress. He and the previous subcommittee chairman Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD), who is now the ranking member of the subcommittee, advocate for more nuclear-powered surface ships in order to reduce the Navy's dependence on imported oil. Taylor is also a member of the Readiness subcommittee of the Armed Services committee in the 110th Congress.|$|E
