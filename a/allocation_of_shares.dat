In 2004, Google used the Dutch Auction system for its Initial Public Offering. Traditional U.S. investment banks have shown resistance to the idea of using an auction process to engage in public securities offerings. The auction method allows for equal access to the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> and eliminates the favorable treatment accorded important clients by the underwriters in conventional IPOs. In the face of this resistance, the Dutch Auction is still a little used method in U.S. public offerings, although there have been hundreds of auction IPOs in other countries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Current {{distributed}} computing infrastructures, such as peerto-peer networks, grids, {{and more recently}} clouds, make sharing and trading resources ubiquitous. In these large distributed systems, rational users are both providers and consumers of resources. Currently, there is growing interest in exploiting economic models for the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>shared</b> computing resources that incentivize rational users. However, {{when the number of}} resource types and users increases, computational complexity <b>of</b> the <b>allocation</b> algorithms grows rapidly and efficiency deteriorates. In this paper, we propose a scalable distributed market framework for the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>shared</b> resources in large distributed systems. We use mechanism design to create a pricing scheme that allocates a request for multiple resource types, by trading economic efficiency for computational efficiency, strategy-proof and budget-balance. To address scalability, our proposed framework leverages on a peer-to-peer overlay for resource discovery and management. We prototype our framework using FreePastry, a popular overlay network based on the Pastry protocol. We show that our scheme is efficient and scalable using both simulation experiments and results from the deployment on PlantLab. ...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{develop a}} model in which a large {{investor}} has access to a costly monitoring technology affecting securities' expected payoffs. <b>Allocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> are determined through trading among risk-averse investors. Despite the free-rider problem associated with monitoring, risk-sharing considerations lead to equilibria in which monitoring takes place. Under certain conditions, the equilibrium allocation is Pareto efficient and all agents hold the market portfolio of risky assets independent of the specific monitoring technology. Otherwise, distortions in risk sharing may occur and monitoring activities that reduce the expected payoff on the market portfolio may be undertaken.
