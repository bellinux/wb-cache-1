2500|$|Alameda County Sheriff's deputies used {{shotguns}} to fire {{at people}} {{sitting on the}} roof at the Telegraph Repertory Cinema. James Rector, a student, was killed when shot by police. The Alamada County Coroner's report listed cause of death as [...] "shock and hemorrhage due to multiple shotgun wounds and perforation of the aorta." [...] The buckshot is {{the same size as}} a [...]38 caliber bullet. Governor Reagan conceded that Rector was probably shot by police but countered that [...] "it's very naive to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should send anyone into that kind of conflict with a flyswatter." [...] The University of California Police Department (UCPD) claims Rector threw steel rebar down onto the police; however, according to Time Magazine, Rector was a bystander, not a protester.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{addressed}} {{this idea of}} proving God in this discourse. He says, [...] "When one grows older, everything becomes so miserable. God in heaven has to sit {{and wait for the}} decision on his fate, whether he exists, and finally he comes into existence {{with the help of a}} few demonstrations; human beings have to put up with waiting for the matter to be decided. Suppose that a person died before that time; suppose that when the matter was finally decided he was not in the practice of thinking about God as a Creator and the joy over that was all gone!" [...] He also said, [...] "Even though the Preacher ordinarily speaks rigorously to people, he nevertheless is so courteous as to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> understand that there is a God is not so vain as to think that he has invented the existence of God. He had already made his decision about Christianity as early as 1835 when he wrote:it is not possible to harvest immediately what one has sown. I will remember that philosopher's method of having his disciples keep silent for three years; then I dare say it will come. Just as one does not begin a feast at sunrise but at sundown, just so in the spiritual world one must work forward for some time before the sun really shines for us and rises in all its glory; for although it is true as it says that God lets his sun shine upon the good and the evil and lets the rain fall on the just and the unjust, it is not so in the spiritual world. So let the die be cast — I am crossing the Rubicon! No doubt this road takes me into battle, but I will not renounce it. I will not lament the past — why lament? I will work energetically and not waste time in regrets, like the person stuck in a bog and first calculating how far he has sunk without recognizing that during the time he spends on that he is sinking still deeper. I will hurry along the path I have found and shout to everyone I meet: Do not look back as Lot's wife did, but remember that we are struggling up a hill.|$|E
