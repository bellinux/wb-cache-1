Efﬂuents were ﬁltered by ultraﬁltration (UF) and nano- ﬁltration (NF) membranes and samples were analysed for traditional parameters, such as COD, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and colour. While UF was capable of only partial removal of colour, COD and DOC, NF was shown to be capable of removing close to 100 % of the organic content of the molasses and lignocellulosic efﬂuents. Use of advanced analytical techniques, such as ﬂuorescence excitation emission matrix analysis and liquid chromatography, helped to illustrate the difference between organic compounds found within molasses and lignocellulosic efﬂuents.

50|$|<b>Aerobic</b> <b>digestion</b> is a {{bacterial}} process {{occurring in the}} presence of oxygen resembling a continuation of the activated sludge process.

40|$|Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE AR-SA MicrosoftInternetExplorer 4 Backgrounds and Objectives: Large {{quantities}} of sludge are produced in biological wastewater treatment. Because this sludge is highly rotten, {{it should be}} stabilized before its disposal. <b>Aerobic</b> and anaerobic <b>digestion</b> is widely considered as stabilization techniques. Because of high retention time and sludge dewatering difficulties, reduction in retention time, operation and maintenance should be given into consideration. Ultrasonic process increases the enzymatic activity, so decreases the hydrolysis time, a limiting factor in digestion process, and contributes to the decrease of the detention time. The objective of this investigation {{is to determine the}} effect of ultrasound in improving dewatering and stabilization of aerobic and anaerobic digested sludge. In addition, the impact of ultrasonic treatment on improvement of sludge dewatering and <b>aerobic</b> and anaerobic <b>digestion</b> is compared. Materials and Methods: In this survey, samples of <b>aerobic</b> and anaerobic <b>digestion</b> were collected from local full-scale Garb Town and Tehran South wastewater treatment plant, respectively. The grab samples were collected for 4 month from July to October 2010. Total numbers of 20 samples were collected biweekly for each type of digestion. Each sample was sonicated for 15, 30, 60, and 90 min under 35 and 131 kHz frequencies separately. Total solids, volatile solids, pH, temperature, total COD, dissolved COD and settle able solids were measured. Ultrasound bath of the solution in a 300 mL glass reactor was performed as a bath reactor with power of 500 W. Result: The results showed that the application of ultrasonic wave increased dissolved COD and temperature and decreased volatile solid, pH and settle able solids. Application of ultrasonic wave with frequency of 131 kHz decreased the VS and increased the dewatering of sludge more effective than the 35 kHz frequency and the highest performance was at 15 min of time and 131 kHz of frequency. Also sonication method showed better efficiency for anaerobic sludge samples compared to the aerobic sludge samples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion: The results obtained showed that digestion and dewatering properties of sludge improved by ultrasonic application. Therefore it can be used as an alternative method for the sludge treatment. st 1 ":*{behavior:url(#ieooui) } /* Style Definitions */ table.

40|$|Recycled {{paper mill}} {{wastewater}} is currently treated and irrigated on site at Amcor Fibre Packaging Mill Spearwood, in Western Australia. The residual organics in wastewater create odour and filter fouling problems. In this study, parameter {{spaces of the}} following potential treatments were investigated: enzymes (cellulase mixtures), microbial digestion, and wet oxidation (150 °C and 540 - 560 kPa with combinations of NaOH, H 20 21 and CH 3 COOH). The success of treatments was assessed by comparing the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and filterability before and after treatment. The enzyme treated wastewater samples showed no significant difference to the control, possibly due the presence of in situ bacterial populations or cooked starch. <b>Aerobic</b> bacterial <b>digestion</b> reduced filterability and COD reduction (maximum 17 %) was unsatisfactory. Wet oxidation significantly increased the filterability and COD reduction of wastewater. Cooking time was a significant factor. Up to 79 % reduction in COD was achieved after 30 minutes of wet oxidation. Acetic acid and 10 minutes of wet oxidation removed 83 % of COD, but also corroded the test apparatus.

The laboratory model digesters used in this study were maintained at a 15 -day retention schedule, partially simulating a continuously operating system. Ascaris eggs were destroyed in the anaerobic (23 %) or aerobic (38 %) digesters, and 11 % Trichuris eggs were destroyed in the aerobic digesters. Trichuris eggs in anaerobic digesters and Toxocara eggs in either anaerobic or aerobic digesters were not destroyed. Destruction of eggs in digesters was correlated with the state of the eggs before subjection to the treatment processes; i. e., some Ascaris and Trichuris eggs were already embryonated in host intestinal contents or feces and hence past their most resistant stage. The viabilities of Ascaris and Toxocara eggs that survived the digestion processes were greater in anaerobically treated than in aerobically treated material. Eggs from Hymenolepis were nonviable before use in the experiments. However, they were more effectively destroyed in aerobic digesters than in anaerobic digesters...|$|R
