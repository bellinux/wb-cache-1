In this paper we proposes a real-time control algorithm based on a model reference adaptive control mechanism for a class of nonlinear systems. In order to obtain the reference model, an off-line procedure is used, while the controller’s parameters are determined on-line, using a static gain adaptation criterion. In order to demonstrate the relevance of this approach, several tests on nonlinear processes, using a real-time <b>applications</b> <b>package</b> developed in LabWindows/CVI were made. A solution, designed for a class of nonlinear systems, based on parametric adaptation of an RST controller is presented. Issues on the stability and robustness of the solution are also discussed.

40|$|The CrossGrid {{project is}} one of the ongoing {{research}} projects involving GRID technology. One of the main tasks in the Meteorological <b>applications</b> <b>package</b> is the implementation of data mining systems for the analysis of operational and reanalysis databases of atmospheric circulation patterns. Previous parallel data mining algorithms reported in the literature focus on parallel computers with predetermined resources (processing units) and high-performance communications. The main goal in this project is designing adaptive schemes for distributing data and computational load according to the changing resources available for each GRID job submitted. In this paper, some preliminary work regarding two different data mining algorithms (self organizing maps and smoothing filters) is presented. These techniques can be used in combination with databases of observations to provide downscaled local forecasts from operative model outputs. This is a more general framework to look at data mining techniques from the meteorological point of view. ...|$|E

According to Directive 2002 / 49 /EC (END), several noise sources (like roads, railways, aircraft, industrial sites, ports) have to be considered and mapped separately; so, in the first step, the acoustical characterization of ships is required. Annex IV of the Directive, in particular, establishes that strategic noise maps for agglomerations shall put a special emphasis on noise emitted by industrial activities, including ports. Four kinds of ships were investigated, using the combined Italian technical standards UNI 10855 and UNI 11143 : (1) inland navigation ships (along wharves), (2) ferries (along wharves and when manoeuvring), (3) Cruises, small size (along wharves), (4) Cruises, large size (along wharves and when manoeuvring).

40|$|International audienceIn the Data Warehouse (DW) technology, On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP) {{is a good}} <b>applications</b> <b>package</b> that {{empowers}} {{decision makers}} to explore and navigate into a multidimensional structure of precomputed measures, which {{is referred to as}} a Data Cube. Though, OLAP is poorly equipped for forecasting and predicting empty measures of data cubes. Usually, empty measures translate inexistent facts in the DW and in most cases are a source of frustration for enterprise managements, especially when strategic decisions need to be taken. In the recent years, various studies have tried to add prediction capabilities to OLAP applications. For this purpose, generally, Data Mining and Machine Learning methods have been widely used to predict new measures' values in DWs. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach attempting to extend OLAP to a prediction application. Our approach operates in two main stages. The first one is a preprocessing one that makes use of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data cube and then generates ad hoc training sets. The second stage proposes a novel OLAP oriented architecture of Multilayer Perceptron Networks (MLP) that learns from each training set and comes out with predicted measures of inexistent facts.

40|$|Warpage {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{concerns}} in manufacturing BGA, CSP, POP or QFN based array packages because a reasonably flat package is critical to successful singulation and board level assembly processes. Warpage of a package is a result of curing shrinkage of encapsulated mold compounds (EMC) and CTE mismatch between various packaging materials. In a completed package, all components are bound together by the crosslinked polymers, i. e. EMC and die-attaching adhesive (D/A). No component can expand or shrink freely. In a typical array package, warpage is in the form of either a 'crying' face (corners facing downward) or a 'smiling' face (corners facing upward), depending on the correlations of the packaging materials' mechanical, physical and chemical properties. Fine pitch ball grid array (fpBGA) is a chip scale package offering a competitive solution for mobile <b>applications.</b> <b>Package</b> thickness ranges from 1. 4 mm down to 0. 6 mm with ball pitches as small as 0. 4 mm. Since the package is very thin, warpage control is a big challenge. In this study, an accurate finite element model, incorporated appropriate material properties was developed to predict the warpage of fpBGA under reflow condition. The experimental measurements of the warpage behavior of the fpBGA under solder-reflow condition were conducted using an Akrometrix TherMoire PS 200. The experimental results were compared with the results of FE analysis, which provides feedbacks for modeling optimization. Effects of material properties and geometric parameters on thermal warpage were then studied using the optimized models. © 2009 IEEE...|$|E

The open source nature of android en- courages developers to innovate wide-range of applications. Meantime, the sweeping android acceptance with individuals and industries {{caught the attention of}} malicious software writers, which led to a sharp increase of security threats. Such threats raise a deeper concern in financial and healthcare applications that are inherently bound to handle private and sensitive information. The research provides a deeper analysis on security vulnerabilities of android applications in finance and healthcare category, from official Google app store. It is proposed and implemented a security analysis framework that takes account {{of a wide range of}} vulnerability metrics to provide unified and quantified method of measuring android applications vulnerability. The framework implementation automated the process of crawling google's app store, downloading <b>applications</b> <b>package</b> to a repository and conducting vulnerability analysis. It automatically extracts security parameters, measures vulnerability metrics and generates vulnerability report. The security parameters were extracted from manifest, de-compiled source code and app store meta-data. The analysis, on the top 632 free apps from finance and medical category revealed that on average financial apps found to be more vulnerable than medical apps. Medical apps have the maximum value for all types of vulnerabilities. Furthermore, a descriptive statistical analysis on the vulnerability metrics revealed that there is a linear relationship between implicitly open components and the number of times they access sensitive android resources...|$|E
