Among the wildcard teams was , the first African trade team {{to participate in the}} Tour. As each team was entitled to enter nine riders, the peloton on the first stage consisted of 198 riders. These came from 32 countries. 41 riders – approximately <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peloton – were French; no other nation had more than 20 riders in the race.

5|$|Fort Snelling was {{established}} in 1819 to extend United States jurisdiction over the area and to allay concerns about British fur traders in the area. The soldiers initially camped at a site {{on the south side}} of the Minnesota River, but conditions were hard there and nearly <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldiers died of scurvy in the winter of 1819–1820. They later moved their camp to Camp Coldwater in May 1820. Much of the military's activity was conducted there while the fort was built. Camp Coldwater, the site of a cold, clear, flowing spring, was also considered sacred by the native Dakota.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581d orbits Gliese 581 at 0.21847 AU, {{approximately}} <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{distance that}} the Earth orbits the Sun, though its orbital eccentricity {{has not been}} confirmed. There are currently two models for its orbit, a circular one like Earth's, and an eccentric one like Mercury's.

Under the four planet model Gliese 581d would most probably be in a spin-orbit resonance of 2:1, rotating twice for each orbit of its parent star. Therefore, the day on Gliese 581d should approximately be 67 Earth days long.|$|E
5|$|In 1876–77, however, {{towards the}} end of the period of direct British rule, Mysore was struck by a devastating famine with {{estimated}} mortality figures ranging between 700,000 and 1,100,000, or nearly <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population. Shortly thereafter, Maharaja Chamaraja X, educated in the British system, took over the rule of Mysore in 1881, following the success of a lobby set up by the Wodeyar dynasty that was in favour of rendition. Accordingly, a resident British officer was appointed at the Mysore court and a Diwan to handle the Maharaja's administration. From then onwards, until Indian independence in 1947, Mysore remained a Princely State within the British Indian Empire, with the Wodeyars continuing their rule.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, only {{a simple}} {{commemorative}} plaque {{was placed in}} the forest and the grave sites were marked with concrete borders. The plaque stated that 46,500 Soviet citizens had died and omitted mentioning nationalities. The location had been neglected and slowly degrading since. The first plans for the Bikernieki forest grave site cleanup were formed in 1986 by a team from the Komunālprojekts Institute. The team included Gaļina Lobaševa, Vija Jansone, Gaļina Alsina, Ineta Vītola, Māris Galarovskis, and Sergey Rizh in the lead. The project received Riga City Council's approval and state funding and the works continued until 1991 when the current government was dissolved after Latvia declared independence. The work halted at around <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> completion with only the surrounding terrain cleared and central and entrance memorial signs erected.|$|E
5|$|In the 1974 federal election, it {{succeeded in}} having Hall {{elected to the}} Australian Senate with a primary vote of 10 per cent in South Australia.

However, the non-Labor parties narrowly failed to dislodge the incumbent Dunstan Labor government. That result, together with internal weaknesses, led in 1976 to the LM's being re-absorbed into the LCL, which by then had become the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia. The non-Labor forces again failed at the 1977 state election but succeeded in winning government for one term at the 1979 state election.|$|E

The nostrils are divided into small incurrent and excurrent openings by short, triangular flaps of skin that do not reach the mouth. The mouth is extremely large, without furrows at the corners. The teeth are numerous and small with multiple cusps; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. The large, oval eyes are placed somewhat on the upper surface of the head, and have rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and ridges underneath.|$|E
5|$|The Legion took a {{short break}} from active duty to receive new aircraft, {{including}} Bf 109Es, He 111Es and Js, and Hs 126As, bringing its strength to 96 aircraft, around <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nationalist's force as a whole. Von Richthofen returned to Spain in overall command, with Hans Seidemann as chief of staff. This reinforcement {{may have been the}} single most important intervention by a foreign side in the war, enabling a counterattack after the Battle of the Ebro. It mainly took part in operations against the remaining Republican air force during January–February 1939, with considerable success. It was rapidly dissolved. The men returned on 26 May; the best aircraft were returned to Germany {{and the rest of the}} equipment bought by the new Spanish regime.|$|E
5|$|The current monarch, Abdullah II, {{ascended to}} the throne in February 1999 {{after the death of}} his father Hussein.

King Abdullah's eldest son, Prince Hussein, is the current Crown Prince of Jordan. The current prime minister is Hani Al-Mulki who received his position on 29 May 2016. Abdullah had announced his intentions of turning Jordan into a parliamentary system, where the largest bloc in parliament forms a government. However, the underdevelopment of political parties in the country have hampered such moves. Jordan has around 50 political parties representing nationalist, leftist, Islamist, and liberal ideologies. Political parties contested <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seats in the 2016 elections, the remainder belonging to independent politicians.|$|E

5|$|The {{hypothalamus}} in the diencephalon, {{is involved}} in regulating many functions of the body. Functions include neuroendocrine regulation, regulation of the circadian rhythm, control of the autonomic nervous system, and the regulation of fluid, and food intake. The circadian rhythm is controlled by two main cell groups in the hypothalamus. The anterior hypothalamus includes the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus which through gene expression cycles, generates a roughly 24 hour circadian clock. In the circadian day an ultradian rhythm takes control of the sleeping pattern. Sleep is an essential requirement for the body and brain and allows the closing down and resting of the body's systems. There are also findings that suggest that the daily build-up of toxins in the brain are removed during sleep. Whilst awake the brain consumes <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body’s total energy needs. Sleep necessarily reduces this use and gives time {{for the restoration of}} energy-giving ATP. The effects of sleep deprivation show the absolute need for sleep.|$|E

5|$|Crocodilian {{teeth are}} adapted for seizing and holding prey, and food is {{swallowed}} unchewed. The digestive tract is relatively short, as meat {{is a fairly}} simple substance to digest. The stomach {{is divided into two}} parts: a muscular gizzard that grinds food, and a digestive chamber where enzymes work on it. The stomach is more acidic than that of any other vertebrate and contains ridges for gastroliths, which {{play a role in the}} mechanical breakdown of food. Digestion takes place more quickly at higher temperatures. Crocodilians have a very low metabolic rate and consequently, low energy requirements. This allows them to survive for many months on a single large meal, digesting the food slowly. They can withstand extended fasting, living on stored fat between meals. Even recently hatched crocodiles are able to survive 58 days without food, losing 23% of their bodyweight during this time. An adult crocodile needs between a tenth and <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amount of food necessary for a lion of the same weight, and can live for half a year without eating.|$|E
