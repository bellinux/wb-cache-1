I told him I'd heard he took an interest in scientific things. He said yes. Sniffed again. Kept on sniffing all the time; evidently recently caught an infernal cold. No wonder, wrapped up like that! I developed the nurse idea, and all the while kept my eyes open. Bottles--chemicals--everywhere. Balance, test-tubes in stands, and a smell of--evening primrose. Would he subscribe? Said he'd consider it. Asked him, point-blank, was he researching. Said he was. A long research? Got quite cross. 'A damnable long research,' said he, blowing the cork out, so to speak. 'Oh,' said I. And out came the grievance. The man was just on the boil, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> boiled him over. He had been given a prescription, most valuable prescription--what for he wouldn't say. Was it medical? 'Damn you! What are you fishing after?' I apologised. Dignified sniff and cough. He resumed. He'd read it. Five ingredients. Put it down; turned his head. Draught of air from window lifted the paper. Swish, rustle. He was working in a room with an open fireplace, he said. Saw a flicker, and there was the prescription burning and lifting chimneyward. Rushed towards it just as it whisked up the chimney. So! Just at that point, to illustrate his story, out came his arm." ...|$|E

60|$|However, I didn't {{find myself}} depressed, and I didn't find the great mind {{that was so}} good as to shine upon us at that awkward moment however dimly {{anything}} but augmented; what was its sensibility to the evil faces {{but part of the}} large old tenderness which the occasion had caused to overflow and on which we were presently floated back into the room she had left?--where we might perhaps beguile a little the impatience of the sufferer waiting for relief. We ventured in our flutter to doubt whether we should beguile, we held back with a certain delicacy from this irruption, and if there was a momentary wonderful and beautiful conflict I remember how our yielding struck me as crowned with the finest grace it could possibly have, that of the prodigious privilege of humouring, yes literally humouring so renowned a spirit at a moment when we could really match our judgment with hers. For the injured young man, in the other and the larger room, simply lay stretched on his back on the floor, the posture apparently least painful to him--though painful enough at the best I easily saw on kneeling beside him, after my first dismay, to ask if I could in any way ease him. I see his face again, fair and young and flushed, with its vague little smile and its moist brow; I recover the moment or two during which we sought to make natural conversation in his presence, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> as to what conversation was natural; and then as his father's return still failed my having the inspiration that at once terminated the strain of the scene and yet prolonged the sublime connection. Mightn't I then hurry off for Mr. Paget?--on whom, as fast as a cab could carry me, I would wait with the request that he would come at the first possible moment to the rescue. Mrs. Lewes's and our stricken companion's instant appreciation of this offer lent me wings on which I again feel myself borne very much as if suddenly acting as a messenger of the gods--surely I had never come so near to performing in that character. I shook off my fellow visitor for swifter cleaving of the air, and I recall still feeling that I cleft it even in the dull four-wheeler of other days which, on getting out of the house, I recognised as the only object animating, at a distance, the long blank Sunday vista beside the walled-out Regent's Park. I crawled to Hanover Square--or was it Cavendish? I let the question stand--and, after learning at the great man's door that though he was not at home he was soon expected back and would receive my message without delay, cherished {{for the rest of the}} day the particular quality of my vibration.|$|E

40|$|This text {{refers to}} the Indian {{religious}} beliefs, Hinduism in particular, that we can meet in the Czech Republic. Many {{people are interested in}} these religions <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> is 'what makes present man so interested in these religions and what is so attractive to them?' Foremost in my text there is basic information about Hinduism, including the myths, Gods and Goddesses and creeds. As the Indian culture is very diverse and rich I have only mentioned basic information for understanding the text well. Then I have described yoga in the text, Bhaktiyoga in particular. This type of yoga forms part of the Hare Khrisna movement. Both Yoga in Daily Life and the Hare Khrisna have already worked for many years and both have continuity with their Indian founders and came into our subconscious through their spiritual pursuit. I have described their influence in the Czech Republic on the basis of my questionnaire and even on my personal experience. Apart from these two movements this text refers to individual persons who are active in this kind of lifestyle. My conclusion is that these religious trends do not signify any danger or threat for our society; on the contrary it means that by helping us to find our way to God this enriches our daily lives.

40|$|In this essay, I {{will look}} at three {{different}} Compulsory comprehensive schools in one community and I will compare final grades from students who graduated in spring 2006. I will also examine how the three schools work with students, and in what way they approach students with dyslexia/reading- and writing difficulties, {{so that they could}} reach goals set by The Swedish National Agency for Education. The aim with this essay is to show differences between schools in the same community <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> is if it is the way you approach students with dyslexia/reading- and writing difficulties that affects the student’s grades and results. The study is concentrating on three schools in one community and students with dyslexia and reading- and writing difficulties that went to those schools. I have spoken to remedial teacher at each school about how they approach students with dyslexia/reading- and writing difficulties, what kind of methods the use, how they investigate if a student is in need of special help and how they grade their students who are in need of special teaching because of their learning disabilities. This essay will also present different ways of defining dyslexia and how to approach the pedagogic difficulties that will appear in situations where students with reading- and writing difficulties gets exposed and are in need of special education or help. The results of this study can only be connected to those schools that have been studied for this exam. The results can not in any way be generalising for all schools in Sweden. However did the study results show that students that went to school 2 reached higher goals than students that went to school 1 or 3. The study also shows that these schools use different ways to work with students with dyslexia and reading- and writing difficulties. But to compare numbers and grades can’t give a fair picture of how each school work with each student so that they develop those skills and knowledge that is seen as necessary to become a democratic member of the society. Because numbers and grades cant tell anything about the student’s disabilities or what kind of knowledge or skills the student is in possession of. Nevertheless can this study when comparing grades, in the most general way, say that students that go to school 2 are more likely to reach goals that are set by The Swedish National Agency for Education...|$|E

40|$|The African {{customary}} law, 1 {{relating to}} the intestate succession has always been known to discriminate against women and specifically female children. We live in a developing country where the law {{is used as a}} tool to develop and transform the lives of the people. Legislation has previously failed to prohibit the discrimination against women and female children <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>question</b> is whether the law of our current times has succeeded to protect women and female children against the customary law of intestate succession in South Africa. The Constitution of South Africa 1996 is the supreme law of the country of South Africa and it provided the legal foundation for the Republic. In my dissertation I will be focusing on section 9 of the Constitution of South Africa 1996 which stipulates the following: ?Everyone is equal before the law and has the right to equal protection and benefit of the law. Being equal before the law means all laws may not unfairly discriminate against anyone. Everyone is entitled to equal rights and freedom. This also means there should be equal representation on legislative bodies (in other words, bodies that make our laws). In this way we can make sure that all the different needs {{of the people of the}} country are shown in the laws. The right to 'equal protection before the law' means people have a right to the same opportunities and to have equal access to resources, which would allow them to be equal in the future?. 2 The question is whether section 9 of the Constitution is being promoted amongst the African people in South Africa who are still practicing and living according to customary law when it comes to issues of intestate succession. 3 Amongst tribes in South Africa, succession to status in customary law is based on the principle of primogeniture 4. According to that principle the eldest son is the only person eligible to succeed the deceased. The women and female children are excluded from succeeding the deceased. This means that the women and female children were excluded purely on the basis of gender. This dissertation will give a background of how the law previously failed to protect women and female children living according to customary law in South Africa on their rights to intestate succession. It will also show the revolution of our law, in discussing the law that is currently in place to protect women and female children and whether these law and legislation are enough to protect women and female children whom are still living according to the customary law in South Africa. Was the declaration of the male primogeniture principle as unconstitutional and the implementation of the Intestate Succession Act 81 of 1987 along with the Reform of Customary law of Succession and Regulation Matters Act 11 of 2009 enough tools to transform and protect women and female children form discrimination in the intestate succession in customary law?Mini Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

40|$|Abstract      The {{purpose of}} my essay is to {{understand}} how language and identity interact in individuals with an immigrant backgrounds? My main focus {{is rooted in the}} individual`s identity <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> are: -        How is the informants talkning about the importance of being able to make themselves understood with the language? -        How do they talk about the creation of identity? -        How does language and identity be linked in their discourse about language and identity?    To accomplish this <b>and</b> to answer <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> I have chosen to use a qualitative method based of interviews. I believe that this method is the most appropriate in order to provide answers to <b>my</b> <b>questions.</b> I interviewed four people who have lived in Sweden between 3 - 6 years. Two of  the  informants are from Latvia and speak fluent swedish, the two other informants come from Chile and are currently learning swedish. These two interviews are therefore made in their native tongue, Spanish. All of the  informants are multi-lingual.    The result of my investigation shows that language and identity are closely related to each other. The new language is used to make new contacts and establish new ”mirrors” in their enviroment and this gives people a sense of coherence and this is needed for the creation of identity. At the same time the mother tongue is needed to be abel to recognize themself, a man defines himself by his language which is also important in the creation of identity. ...|$|R
