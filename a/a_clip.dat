50|$|<b>A</b> <b>clipped</b> {{compound}} word {{is actually}} a type of blend word. Like other blends, clipped compounds may be made {{of two or more}} components. However, a blend may have a meaning independent of its components' meanings (e.g., motel <— motor + hotel), while in <b>a</b> <b>clipped</b> compound the components already serve the function of producing a compound meaning (for instance, pulmotor <— pulmonary + motor). In addition, <b>a</b> <b>clipped</b> compound may drop one component completely: hard instead of hard labor, or mother for motherfucker (a process called ellipsis). Laurie Bauer suggests the following distinction: If the word has the compound stress, it is <b>a</b> <b>clipped</b> compound; if it has a single-word stress, it is blend.|$|R

5|$|In 1931, {{with the}} 1932–33 series in mind, the {{selectors}} had appointed Jardine as England's captain. In {{his efforts to}} build a strategy whereby he could threaten the Australian supremacy, the new captain consulted widely.

This matter had been widely discussed among cricketers; <b>a</b> <b>clip</b> of film from the Oval match appeared to confirm that Bradman had flinched. This, to Jardine, suggested the basis of a plan: a sustained attack of fast leg theory that might unsettle not just Bradman but the Australian batsmen generally.|$|E
