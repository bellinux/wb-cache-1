They begin to engage sexually, but Charlie suddenly grows inexplicably uncomfortable and stops Sam. Charlie begins to realize that his sexual contact with Sam has stirred up repressed memories of him being molested by his Aunt Helen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy.</b> Charlie shows signs of PTSD from the incident and the revelation of his abuse helps the reader understand his view of relationships and love.|$|E
25|$|Sequoyah {{was born}} in the Cherokee town of Tuskegee circa 1770. James Mooney, a {{prominent}} anthropologist and historian of the Cherokee people, quoted a cousin as saying that <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy,</b> he spent his early years with his mother. Estimates of his birth year ranged from 1760 to 1776. His name is believed to come from the Cherokee word siqua meaning 'hog'. However, Davis says the name may have been derived from sikwa (either a hog or an opossum) and vi meaning a place or an enclosure. This is a reference either to a childhood deformity or to a later injury that left Sequoyah disabled.|$|E
500|$|Uranium-235 {{was derived}} from {{enrichment}} of natural uranium at the Y-12 plant and K-25 site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Improvements in the processes and procedures of the electromagnetic and gaseous isotope separation between October 1945 and June 1946 led {{to an increase in}} production to around [...] of uranium-235 per month, which was only enough for one of the very wasteful Little Boys. A Fat Man was 17.5 times as efficient <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Boy,</b> but a ton of uranium ore could yield eight times as much uranium-235 as plutonium, and on a per-gram basis, plutonium cost somewhere between four and eight times as much to produce as uranium-235, which at this time cost around $26 per gram.|$|E

500|$|Kemper {{also had}} a dark fantasy life: he {{performed}} rites with his younger sister's dolls that culminated in him removing their heads and hands, and, on one occasion, when his elder sister, Susan Hughey Kemper (1943–2014), teased him and asked why he {{did not try to}} kiss his teacher, he replied: [...] "If I kiss her, I'd have to kill her first." [...] He also recalled that <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy,</b> he would sneak out of his house and, armed with his father's bayonet, go to his second-grade teacher's house to watch her through the windows. Kemper stated in later interviews that as a child some of his favorite games to play were [...] "Gas Chamber" [...] and [...] "Electric Chair", in which he asked his younger sister to tie him up, flip an imaginary switch and then he would tumble over and writhe on the floor, pretending to be dying of gas inhalation or electric shock. He also had two near-death experiences as a child, once when his elder sister tried to push him in front of a train, and another when she successfully pushed him into the deep end of a swimming pool, where he almost drowned.|$|E

Reflecting on his childhood in The Bronx, DeLillo later described how he was [...] "...always out in the street. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> I whiled away most of my time pretending to be a baseball announcer on the radio. I could think up games for hours at a time. There were eleven of us in a small house, but the close quarters were never a problem. I didn't know things any other way. We always spoke English and Italian all mixed up together. My grandmother, who lived in America for fifty years, never learned English." ...|$|E

It explores Petrović's broken friendship with Serbian/Yugoslav player Vlade Divac.
