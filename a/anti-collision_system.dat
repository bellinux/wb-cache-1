50|$|The {{cockpit of}} an {{aircraft}} {{is a typical}} location for avionic equipment, including control, monitoring, communication, navigation, weather, and <b>anti-collision</b> <b>systems.</b> The majority of aircraft power their avionics using 14- or 28‑volt DC electrical systems; however, larger, more sophisticated aircraft (such as airliners or military combat aircraft) have AC systems operating at 400 Hz, 115 volts AC. There are several major vendors of flight avionics, including Panasonic Avionics Corporation, Honeywell (which now owns Bendix/King), Rockwell Collins, Thales Group, GE Aviation Systems, Garmin, Raytheon, Parker Hannifin, UTC Aerospace Systems and Avidyne Corporation.|$|R

50|$|All {{aircraft}} built after 11 March 1996 {{must have}} an anti-collision light system (strobe lights or rotating beacon) turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. The <b>anti-collision</b> <b>system</b> is recommended in good visibility, where only strobes and beacon are required. For example, just before pushback, the pilot must keep the beacon lights on to notify ground crews that the engines are about to start. These beacon lights stay on {{for the duration of}} the flight. While taxiing, the taxi lights are on. When coming onto the runway, the taxi lights go off and the landing lights and strobes go on. When passing 10,000 feet, the landing lights are no longer required, and the pilot can elect to turn them off. The same cycle in reverse order applies when landing.|$|E
5000|$|Switching (either {{moving from}} track to track or to/from Monorail Shop): When moving trains from one beam to another, other trains on both lines were {{required}} to hold outside of the block (or section) containing the switch. Trains being moved were emptied of guests and the entire process was controlled by way of clearance delivered by radio between the switch beam operator (who stood under the switch), the train operator, and Monorail Base (the lead at TTC). At that time Monorail Base had responsibility of oversight for the entire system (Monorail Concourse now has the duty). The entire process is carefully coordinated and executed. To engage the train's motors during a switching operation, the pilot must override the automatic <b>anti-collision</b> <b>system</b> throughout (MAPO) the entire switch. Speed through the switches was strictly limited to [...] "nudging" [...] (extremely slow) {{over most of the}} switches due to the degree of change; except for the Epcot switches where speed was limited to 15 mph (the Epcot switches are beam replacement style and have less degree of change). Drivers announced by radio when they had reached designated support pylons at various parts in the switching process. Whenever operationally possible, the switching operation was completed with the train moving in forward and the pilot occupying the cab which allowed him/her to see consistent with the forward operation. Occasionally the switching operation a portion of the operation to be completed in reverse. Because operating a train presents significant safety concerns, such operations were only conducted when other trains had been removed from the system and the entire process was supervised by additional personnel to ensure the train would not approach an open switch. Reverse operations with guests on board were prohibited except in extreme situations. Rather than operate a train in reverse with guests on board, having the train towed was preferred.|$|E

40|$|The {{operation}} of an <b>anti-collision</b> RFID <b>system</b> {{is characterized by}} the interrogation zone which should be estimated in any direction of 3 D space for a group of electronic transponders. The interrogation zone should be as large as possible. However, the many problems in this area are {{due to the fact that}} energy can be transferred to transponders only on a limited distance. The greatest flexibility in developing RFID applications and shaping the interrogation zone can be achieved using the system with an antenna multiplexer. Therefore the problem of the interrogation zone determination in HF RFID systems with two orthogonal RWD antennas is presented in the paper. The perceived issues have been effectively dealt with and the solution has been proposed on the basis of the elaborated model. Conducted studies have been used to develop the software tool JankoRFIDmuxHF in the Mathcad environment. The research results are analysed in an example system configuration. The specialized measuring stand has been used for experimental verification of the identification efficiency.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to offer an insight into the costs and {{benefits}} associated with a range of existing or forthcoming electronic aids for heavy vehicles (lorries and coaches). The cost benefit assessment performed was based exclusively on the possible costs or benefits related to road hazard (accidents saved or potentially caused), and the costs of purchase and exploitation of the necessary equipment. Two points of view were applied and compared in this regard: that of the user (the transporter) and that of the community. It is concluded that the available data sources are incomplete concerning those aspects needed to realise a comprehensive cost benefit assessment. In addition, the sources are only partly compatible. The `firmest' conclusion is that the transporters and the community have a totally unequal interest in the application of the equipment. Equipment that is still relatively economical for the transporter and also offers great benefits to the community are: (1) in the shorter term: visual aids such as vision enhancement and blind corner detectors, and the black box introduction; (2) in the longer term: applications that control driving speed, such as Intelligent Cruise Control, <b>anti-collision</b> <b>systems,</b> and aids for keeping on course...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) {{have become}} very {{affordable}} and small in recent years, and are increasingly used {{in a wide range}} of monitoring and surveillance applications. A major problem when operating with swarm of UAVs is the risk of mid-air collisions. Sensor technology to detect other aircrafts in order to prevent collisions currently receives a lot of attention in the research community. Therefore acoustic technologies could play an important role in <b>anti-collision</b> <b>systems</b> for small lightweight UAVs. Since most of aircrafts rely on active propulsion using propellers or jets, they emit noise which reveals their presence and position. It is therefore possible to detect the range and the bearing of other aircraft to avoid collisions without relying on active communication within the swarm. Because acoustic sensing is passive, relatively small, cheap, and low power consuming, the work is focused on the design of microphone array and its on-board processing to deliver anti-collision alerts. But tracking acoustic sources in air faces number of substantial challenges because of low signal to noise ratio of the surrounding aircrafts noises compared to the self noise of the equipped listening UAV. In this context we therefore concentrate on self-noise reduction techniques for on board microphone array processing...|$|R
