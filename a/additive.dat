5|$|Given a {{set with}} an {{addition}} operation, one cannot always define a corresponding subtraction operation on that set; {{the set of}} natural numbers is a simple example. On the other hand, a subtraction operation uniquely determines an addition operation, an <b>additive</b> inverse operation, and an <b>additive</b> identity; for this reason, an <b>additive</b> group {{can be described as}} a set that is closed under subtraction.|$|E

50|$|Although {{motor oil}} is {{manufactured}} with numerous <b>additives,</b> aftermarket oil <b>additives</b> exist, too. A glaring inconsistency of mass-marketed aftermarket oil <b>additives</b> {{is that they}} often use <b>additives</b> which are foreign to motor oil.

5|$|Ethylene bromide was an <b>additive</b> in gasolines {{containing}} lead anti-engine knocking agents. It scavenges lead by forming volatile lead bromide, which is exhausted from the engine.

40|$|AbstractBiomass {{combustion}} {{has a huge}} {{potential to}} produce power and heat in a sustainable way. However, some biomass fuels have high potassium contents, which react with other ash forming elements (i. e. Cl, Si, P and S) and lead to different ash related operational problems. Utilization of <b>additives</b> to abate these problems have been studied and tested for several decades. This work reviews current knowledge and studies about properties and effects of <b>additives</b> reported in the literature. Various <b>additives</b> can mitigate ash related issues by the following possible mechanisms: 1) capturing problematic ash species via chemical adsorption and reactions, 2) physical adsorption and elutriating troublesome ash species from combustion facilities, 3) increasing the biomass ash melting temperature by enhancing inert elements/compounds in ash residues, and 4) restraining biomass ash sintering by diluting and powdering effects from the <b>additives.</b> <b>Additives</b> are grouped according to the contained reactive compounds, including Al-silicates based <b>additives,</b> sulphur based <b>additives,</b> calcium based <b>additives,</b> and phosphorous based <b>additives.</b> <b>Additives</b> with strong chemical adsorption and reaction capacities can minimize K related ash sintering, deposition and slagging during biomass combustion processes. The effective chemical reaction mechanisms {{are closely related to}} K-Al-Si, K-Ca-Si and K-Ca-P systems. The capacities of <b>additives</b> to reduce ash related problems are heavily influenced by mass/molar ratios between the reactive components in the <b>additives</b> and the problematic elements in the biomass ash, as well as the reaction atmosphere and combustion technology. More detailed studies on high temperature reactions between <b>additives</b> and ashes from biomass combustion are needed...|$|R
40|$|By using modifying <b>additives</b> it is {{possible}} to control the setting time of β-tricalcium phosphate and α-tricalcium phosphate cements.

The effect of <b>additives</b> was similar on setting of both β-tricalcium phosphate and α-tricalcium phosphate cements...|$|R

5|$|In April 2012, the USDA {{received}} {{requests from}} beef processors to allow voluntary labeling of products with the <b>additive,</b> and stated it planned to approve labeling after checks for label accuracy.

Following the USDA announcement to allow choices in purchasing decisions for ground beef, many school districts stated that they would opt out of serving ground beef with LFTB.
