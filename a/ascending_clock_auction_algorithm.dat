Our experimental design mimics an industry with small asymmetric polluting firms regulated by different schemes of tradable permits. We consider three allocation/auction policies: auctioning off (costly) permits through an <b>ascending</b> <b>clock</b> <b>auction,</b> grandfathering permits with re-allocation through a single-unit double auction, and grandfathering with re-allocation through an <b>ascending</b> <b>clock</b> <b>auction.</b> Our results confirm both dynamic and static theoretical equivalence of auctioning and grandfathering.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} auctioning long-term gas contracts in Colombia. I propose an annual auction for long-term firm gas contracts. The auction would assign and price all firm gas contracts, {{with the exception of}} gas from the Guajira field, which is assigned administratively at a regulated price. The proposal is a partial market design in that it does not address the transportation of gas from producer to consumer. The goal of the approach is to improve the transparency and efficiency of the gas market with a coordinated auction for long-term gas contracts. Currently, gas contracts are sold in a fragmented bilateral market. There are no standard contracts and little price transparency. A coordinated auction for standard contracts will reduce transaction costs and improve price formation. An annual auction for firm gas contracts with one to five-year duration allows both sides of the market to manage risks. Efficient price formation {{is one of the most}} important objectives of the gas <b>auction.</b> The simultaneous <b>ascending</b> <b>clock</b> <b>auction</b> is ideally suited to promote efficient price formation. The <b>ascending</b> <b>clock</b> <b>auction</b> provides excellent price discovery and enables demanders to freely arbitrage across the products. This assures that any price difference among products is a reflection of value differences. My view is that the coordinated auction proposed here will significantly improve the market for firm gas contracts. ...|$|R

40|$|The European Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) {{has chosen}} to adopt an {{auctioning}} procedure to initially allocate CO 2 emission permits. Free allocation of permits becomes an exception for the third phase (2013 - 2020) and firms have to buy all their permits on the market or via auctions. The ability of bidders to collude is a key concern about {{the design of the}} auction format. To counter the bidding ring, the auction can be open to bidders without compliance obligations (speculators). This paper aims at studying experimentally speculation as a collusion breaking device in two different auction mechanisms: the uniform price sealed bid <b>auction</b> and the <b>ascending</b> <b>clock</b> <b>auction.</b> Our results suggest that a uniform sealed bid auction open to speculators should be chosen from a revenue maximization point of view. In this mechanism, compliance agents are adopting an outbidding strategy toward speculators. This strategy significantly increases the seller’s revenue, compared to the more collusive <b>clock</b> <b>auction.</b> In this one, on the contrary, bidders accommodate speculators, letting them buy permits in the auction and buying their necessary permits on the secondary market. However, as opening the auction to speculators deteriorates efficiency, the regulator faces a trade-off between these two objectives...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper studies {{negative}} externalities’e¤ect on bidding {{strategy and}} auction outcome. We use {{a model of}} one special bidder and two regular bidders, where if the special bidder wins, both regular bidders incur a loss; otherwise, the two losing bidders receive zero payo¤s. Applying the model to an <b>ascending</b> <b>clock</b> <b>auction,</b> regular bidders are shown to bid less aggressively and drop out before reaching their private values. A regular bidder may have to bid above his value {{in order to win}} against the special bidder and thus risks negative pro…t by bidding aggressively. Since both regular bidders avoid the externality if either wins, there is a free riding incentive to drop out early; once one of the regular bidders drops out, however, the remaining one bids aggressively. Despite free riding, the item is ex post e ¢ ciently assigned in most cases. In contrast, in …rst-price sealed bid auctions free riding and aggressive bidding incentives are simultaneous, so ex post e ¢ ciency is less frequent. Using experiments to test the theory, our results suggest that bidders more often exhibit aggressive bidding rather than free riding in an <b>ascending</b> <b>clock</b> auction; furthermore, we show that in …rst-price sealed bid auctions, regular bidders bid more aggressively than the special bidder, indicating aggressive bidding incentives dominate free riding incentives...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{a model in}} which a single bidder (the “entrant”), on winning the auction, imposes a negative externality on two “regular ” bidders. In an <b>ascending</b> price <b>clock</b> <b>auction,</b> in equilibrium when all bidders are active a regular bidder free rides, dropping out before reaching his private value. Despite this free riding problem, in almost all cases, the item is ex post efficiently assigned. In contrast, in a first-price sealed bid auction incentives for free riding and aggressive bidding coexist, leading to a lower ex post efficiency. The experiment shows minimal free riding in the <b>clock</b> <b>auction,</b> but as predicted, when a single regular bidder is left competing with the “entrant ” he bids up to his value plus the externality. In first-price auctions, as predicted regular bidders bid more aggressively than the “entrant, ” and both bid higher than in auctions with no externality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—How to {{efficiently}} and fairly allocate data rate among different users {{is a key}} problem {{in the field of}} multiuser multimedia communication. However, most of the existing optimization-based methods, such as minimizing the weighted sum of the distortions or maximizing the weighted sum of the peak signal-to-noise ratios (PSNRs), have their weights heuristically determined. Moreover, those approaches mainly focus on the efficiency issue while there is no notion of fairness. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a game-theoretic framework, in which the utility/payoff function of each user/player is jointly determined by the characteristics of the transmitted video sequence and the allocated bit-rate. We show that a unique Nash equilibrium (NE), which is proportionally fair in terms of both utility and PSNR, can be obtained, according to which the controller can {{efficiently and}} fairly allocate the available network bandwidth to the users. Moreover, we propose a distributed cheat-proof rate allocation scheme for the users to converge to the optimal NE using alternative <b>ascending</b> <b>clock</b> <b>auction.</b> We also show that the traditional optimization-based approach that maximizes the weighted sum of the PSNRs is a special case of the game-theoretic framework with the utility function defined as an exponential function of PSNR. Finally, we show several experimental results on real video data to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.

50|$|A later {{variation}} of the <b>auction</b> <b>algorithm</b> that solves shortest path problems was introduced by Bertsekas in 1991.It is a simple algorithm for finding shortest paths in a directed graph. In the single origin/single destination case, the <b>auction</b> <b>algorithm</b> maintains a single path starting at the origin, which is then extended or contracted by a single node at each iteration. Simultaneously, at most one dual variable will be adjusted at each iteration, in order to either improve or maintain {{the value of a}} dual function. In the case of multiple origins, the <b>auction</b> <b>algorithm</b> is well-suited for parallel computation. The algorithm is closely related to <b>auction</b> <b>algorithms</b> for other network flow problems. According to computational experiments, the <b>auction</b> <b>algorithm</b> is generally inferior to other state-of-the-art algorithms for the all destinations shortest path problem, but is very fast for problems with few destinations (substantially more than one and substantially less than the total number of nodes); see the article by Bertsekas, Pallottino, and Scutella, Polynomial <b>Auction</b> <b>Algorithms</b> for Shortest Paths.|$|R

I then present a variation, the package <b>clock</b> <b>auction,</b> adopted by the UK, which addresses many of the problems of the simultaneous ascending auction while building on its strengths. The package <b>clock</b> <b>auction</b> is a simple dynamic auction in which bidders bid on packages of lots. Most importantly, the auction allows alternative technologies that require the spectrum to be organized in different ways to compete in a technology‐neutral auction. In addition, the pricing rule and information policy are carefully tailored to mitigate gaming behavior. An activity rule based on revealed preference promotes price and assignment discovery throughout the clock stage of the auction. Truthful bidding is encouraged, which simplifies bidding and improves efficiency. Experimental tests and early auctions confirm the advantages of the approach. (JEL D 44, C 78, L 96.
