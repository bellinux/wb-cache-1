5|$|The oxazolidinones are protein {{synthesis}} inhibitors: they stop {{the growth and}} reproduction of bacteria by disrupting translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into proteins in the ribosome. Although its mechanism of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> fully understood, linezolid appears {{to work on the}} first step of {{protein synthesis}}, initiation, unlike most other protein synthesis inhibitors, which inhibit elongation.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{members of the}} Sicilian aristocracy who still inhabit their ancestral palazzi are unable to make opening their houses to tourism {{a major source of}} income, unlike some Northern, especially English, counterparts. The local equivalent of the National Trust is very small, and there is much less local interest among the general population. The Princes, Marquesses, and Counts of Sicily still living in their houses dwell in splendid isolation, surrounded often by beauty and decay. It is only today both owners and the state are awakening to the possibility that if <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> taken soon it will be too late to save this particular part of the Sicilian heritage.|$|E
5|$|This holding {{was based}} upon the well-understood {{governmental}} policy of encouraging the Indian to forgo his wandering habits and adopt those of civilized life; and {{it was said that}} to hold that by so doing he acquired no possessory rights to the lands occupied, to which the government would accord protection, would be contrary to the whole spirit of the traditional American policy toward these dependent wards of the nation. The fact that such right of occupancy finds no recognition in any statute or other formal governmental <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> conclusive.|$|E

5|$|The Privy Council {{identified}} one of {{the extreme}} circumstances as that which occurred in Wright & Advertiser Newspapers Limited v. Lewis (1990). In this case, the Supreme Court of South Australia held that an action may proceed against a legislator accused of libel where the whole {{subject matter of the}} alleged libel relates to the legislator's conduct in the legislature so that the effect of parliamentary privilege is to exclude virtually all the evidence necessary to justify the libel. If such an <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> allowed to proceed, not only will there be injustice to the defendant, but there will also be a real danger that the media will be forced to abstain from the truthful disclosure of the legislator's misbehaviour in Parliament. This would be a most serious inroad into freedom of speech since justification would be impossible.|$|E
25|$|Pump-action {{weapons are}} faster to cycle than lever actions, {{but are not}} well suited for firing from a {{supported}} position. Most pump-action designs are found in shotguns, which are typically fired from a standing position where {{the movement of the}} arm to operate the <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an issue.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous {{immunoglobulins}} {{may be used}} {{to control}} SLE with organ involvement, or vasculitis. It is believed that they reduce antibody production or promote the clearance of immune complexes from the body, even though their mechanism of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> well understood. Unlike immunosuppressives and corticosteroids, IVIGs do not suppress the immune system, so there is less risk of serious infections with these drugs.|$|E

25|$|Ketamine {{acts as a}} {{selective}} antagonist of the NMDA receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor. It binds specifically to the dizocilpine (MK-801) site of the NMDA receptor, near the channel pore, and is an uncompetitive antagonist. Ketamine may also interact with and inhibit the NMDAR via another allosteric site on the receptor. Its full mechanism of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> well-understood as of 2017.|$|E
25|$|According to IEA (2012) {{the goal}} of {{limiting}} warming to 2°C is becoming more difficult and costly with each year that passes. If <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> taken before 2017, CO2 emissions would be locked-in by energy infrastructure existing in 2017. Fossil fuels are dominant in the global energy mix, supported by $523 billion subsidies in 2011, up almost 30% on 2010 and six times more than subsidies to renewables.|$|E
25|$|Although lipid rescue {{mechanism}} of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> completely understood, the added lipid {{in the blood}} stream may act as a sink, allowing {{for the removal of}} lipophilic toxins from affected tissues. This theory is compatible with two studies on lipid rescue for clomipramine toxicity in rabbits and with a clinical report on the use of lipid rescue in veterinary medicine to treat a puppy with moxidectin toxicosis.|$|E

25|$|If {{the size}} of the {{undercut}} is small enough and the material is flexible enough a side <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> always required. In these cases the undercut is stripped or snapped out of the mold. When this is done usually a stripping plate or ring is used instead of stripper pins so that the part is not damaged. This technique can be used on internal and external undercuts.|$|E
25|$|Thus, actors (agents) {{employ the}} social rules {{appropriate}} to their culture, ones {{that they have}} learned through socialisation and experience. These rules together with the resources at their disposal are used in social interactions. Rules and resources employed in this manner are not deterministic, but are applied reflexively by knowledgeable actors, albeit that actors’ awareness may {{be limited to the}} specifics of their activities at any given time. Thus, the outcome of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> totally predictable.|$|E
25|$|The Jarmann M1884 fired a 10.15mm {{black powder}} {{cartridge}} in an 8-round, tubular magazine {{in which the}} rounds were lined up in a tube below the barrel. It has a non-rotating bolt (the part of the action that seals the rear end of the barrel) locked by a rotating bolt handle, and reputedly a smooth action.

25|$|Common {{side effects}} include dry mouth, constipation, loss of appetite, sleepiness, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and trouble urinating. Serious side effects include an {{increased}} risk of suicidal behavior in those under the age of 25, seizures, mania, and liver problems. If stopped suddenly a withdrawal syndrome may occur with headaches, sweating, and dizziness. It is unclear if it is safe for use in pregnancy. Its mechanism of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> entirely clear but is believed to involve increased levels of serotonin.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide and its analogs, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, are {{believed}} {{to act in a}} similar fashion even though their exact mechanism of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> yet fully understood. It is believed that they work through different mechanisms in various diseases. The net effect is probably due to different mechanisms combined. Apremilast is, however, believed to work through a different mechanism and therefore will be discussed separately. Mechanism of action will be explained in light of today's knowledge, mainly in MM (Figure 2).|$|E
25|$|While the {{production}} and consumption of CFCs are regulated under the Montreal Protocol, emissions from existing banks of CFCs are not regulated under the agreement. In 2002, there were an estimated 5,791 kilotons of CFCs in existing products such as refrigerators, air conditioners, aerosol cans and others. Approximately one-third of these CFCs are projected to be emitted {{over the next decade}} if <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> taken, posing a threat to both the ozone layer and the climate. A proportion of these CFCs can be safely captured and destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Clozapine is {{associated}} with a relatively high risk of low white blood cells which may result in death. To decrease this risk it is recommended that the blood be regularly monitored. Other serious risks include seizures, inflammation of the heart, high blood sugar levels, and, in older people with psychosis as a result of dementia, an increased risk of death. Common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, low blood pressure, trouble seeing, and dizziness. The potentially permanent movement disorder tardive dyskinesia occurs in about 5% of people. Its mechanism of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> entirely clear.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include {{movement}} problems, sleepiness, trouble seeing, constipation, and increased weight. Serious side effects may include the potentially permanent movement disorder tardive dyskinesia, {{as well as}} neuroleptic malignant syndrome, {{an increased risk of}} suicide, and high blood sugar levels. In older people with psychosis as a result of dementia, it may increase the risk of dying. It is unclear if it is safe for use in pregnancy. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic.

25|$|The mode of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> exactly {{known at}} present, but {{experimental}} evidence indicates praziquantel increases the permeability of the membranes of schistosome cells towards calcium ions. The drug thereby induces contraction of the parasites, resulting in paralysis in the contracted state. The dying parasites are dislodged from their {{site of action}} in the host organism and may enter systemic circulation or may be destroyed by host immune reaction (phagocytosis). Additional mechanisms including focal disintegrations and disturbances of oviposition (laying of eggs) are seen in other types of sensitive parasites.|$|E
