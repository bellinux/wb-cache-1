40|$|We {{report the}} {{measurement}} results and compensation of the antenna elevation angle dependences of the Submillimeter Array (SMA) antenna characteristics. Without optimizing the subreflector (focus) positions {{as a function}} of the antenna elevation angle, antenna beam patterns show lopsided sidelobes, and <b>antenna</b> <b>efficiencies</b> show degradations. The sidelobe level increases and the <b>antenna</b> <b>efficiencies</b> decrease about 1 % and a few %, respectively, for every 10 ◦ change in the elevation angle at the measured frequency of 237 GHz. We therefore obtained the optimized subreflector positions for X (azimuth), Y (elevation), and Z (radio optics) focus axes at various elevation angles for all the eight SMA antennas. The X axis position does not depend on the elevation angle. The Y and Z axes positions depend on the elevation angles, and are well fitted with a simple function for each axis with including a gravity term (cosine and sine of elevation, respectively). In the optimized subreflector positions, the antenna beam patterns show low level symmetric sidelobe of at most a few%, and the <b>antenna</b> <b>efficiencies</b> stay constant at any antenna elevation angles.

40|$|Microstrip antennas are now {{extensively}} used in {{many applications}} such as mobile and satellite communications due to their compactness, lightweight, low profile and conformability to any structure. The size of the conventional microstrip antennas such as rectangular, circular, and triangular, patches is large and unsuitable to be {{used in many}} applications, especially at the lower microwave range. Various techniques have been investigated in the literature {{to reduce the size of}} conventional structures. One can cut slits or slots on the basic shapes which will result in new compact geometries like slotted L-shaped and ring microstrip antennas. The main disadvantage of the resulting compact structures is the associated bandwidth reduction. However, bandwidth can be increased by adding lossy elements in turn of lower <b>antenna</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> One possible solution to avoid the use of lossy elements is the use of tunable or reconfigurable antenna concept [1].

In the old system, rather than allowing licensees to choose any power level which would meet the efficiency and interference standards for their class, stations were restricted to a small set of power levels: 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000, 25000, and 50000 watts. A station whose maximum coverage would otherwise be available at 4500 watts (given a specific directional pattern and antenna system efficiency) had a choice of either living with 2500 watts, or reducing the <b>antenna</b> <b>efficiency</b> to a level which would allow for 5 kW.

50|$|As a {{broadband}} antenna, the T2FD will normally {{display a}} reasonably low {{standing wave ratio}} (SWR) across its entire frequency range.
