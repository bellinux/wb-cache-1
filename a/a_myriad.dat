40|$|Weighted Myriad Smoothers have {{recently}} been proposed as a class of nonlinear filters for robust non-Gaussian signal processing in impulsive noise environments. However, weighted myriad smoothers are severely limited, since their weights are restricted to be non-negative. This constraint makes them unusable in bandpass or highpass filtering applications which require negative filter weights. Further, they are incapable of amplifying selected frequency components of an input signal, since the output of <b>a</b> weighted <b>myriad</b> smoother always lies within the dynamic range of its input samples. In this paper, we generalize the weighted <b>myriad</b> smoother to <b>a</b> richer structure, <b>a</b> weighted <b>myriad</b> filter admitting real-valued weights. This involves assigning a pair of filter weights, one positive and the other negative, {{to each of the}} input samples. Equivalently, the filter can be described as <b>a</b> weighted <b>myriad</b> smoother applied to a transformed set of samples that includes the original input samples [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Biomedical {{signals are}} {{commonly}} recorded with {{many kinds of}} noise. One of these is a waveform of the electrical activity of muscles. This “natural ” distortion is usually modelled with a white Gaussian noise. In order to suppress such noise <b>a</b> weighted <b>myriad</b> filter is applied. The weighted myriad filter belongs to a class of non-linear filters and requires knowledge about noise impulsiveness. An impulsive noise can be described with α-stable distributions. One objective {{of this paper is}} to apply α-stable distribution as a model of real-life muscle noise in ECG signals. The other objective of the paper is to apply <b>a</b> weighted <b>myriad</b> filter to suppress impulsive noise in biomedical (ECG) signals. The reference filters have been the Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter and the median filter. The obtained results have shown that α-stable distributions can be applied to model muscle noise and that <b>a</b> weighted <b>myriad</b> filter with <b>a</b> Chebyshev weighted function can effectively suppress such noise...|$|R

The structure of Darwin's argument showed the influence of John Herschel, whose philosophy of science maintained that a mechanism could be called a vera causa (true cause) if three things could be demonstrated: its existence in nature, its ability to produce the effects of interest, {{and its ability to}} explain a wide range of observations.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of Manhattan, there were <b>a</b> <b>myriad</b> of Hudson River ferries at one point, with boat routes running from New Jersey to twenty {{passenger}} docks in Manhattan. However, the construction of the Holland Tunnel, Lincoln Tunnel, Hudson & Manhattan Railroad, and George Washington Bridge between Manhattan and New Jersey, as well as the growth of car ownership in the United States, meant that these ferries were no longer needed by the mid-20th century. As a result, in 1967, the last cross-Hudson ferry (between Hoboken and Battery Park City) ceased operations.|$|E

5|$|Norman Osborn {{is shown}} to be {{severely}} manic depressive. This has been referenced several times in <b>a</b> <b>myriad</b> of Spider-Man stories. When he is not {{under the direction of}} a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings. At the apex of his mania, he is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations, including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own. Previously, Osborn's arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill. In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own mental illness. After having rid of his powers after the confrontation with the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus), Osborn's sanity apparently restored but remains a villain.|$|E

With the presence of Brion, who conducts a twenty-piece orchestra and plays instruments individually selected by West, the album is largely orchestral in nature, brandishing a euphony of string arrangements, piano chords, brass flecks, and horn riffs among other symphonic instrumentation. They also incorporated <b>a</b> <b>myriad</b> of foreign and vintage instruments not typical in popular music, let alone hip hop, such as a celesta, harpsichord, Chamberlin, CS-80 analog synthesizer, Chinese bells and berimbau, vibraphones, and marimba.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{barriers}} to rapid full-scale growth of commercial unmanned aircraft is the concern for safety. <b>As</b> <b>myriad</b> certification agencies scramble {{to keep up with}} the unique demands of this fast-growing industry, one thing is clear - where applicable, pertinent certification standards for manned aircraft are starting to apply. For the complex electronics that provide communication and control of these systems, this means a swift move towards compliance with DO-178C and DO-254 for software and hardware development. In most cases, the unmanned aircraft can only be operated as part of a system, hence the term “unmanned aircraft system” or UAS. The UAS consists of an unmanned aircraft (UA), a remote pilot station and the command, control and communications links that join them; as such, safety considerations address all of these elements.|$|R

5|$|With the new consensus, {{the major}} issues {{concerning}} Poland and Germany were settled in {{the second week of}} February 1815. Austria gained land in the partition of Poland and prevented the Prussian annexation of Saxony, but was forced to accept Russian dominance in Poland and increasing Prussian influence in Germany. Metternich now focused on getting the various German states to cede historic rights to a new Federal Diet that could stand up to Prussia. He also assisted the Swiss Committee and worked on <b>a</b> <b>myriad</b> of smaller issues, like navigation rights on the Rhine. The beginning of Lent on 8 February brought him more time to devote to these congressional issues as well as private discussions about southern Italy, where Joachim Murat was said to be raising a Neapolitan army. On 7 March Metternich was awakened with the news that Napoleon had escaped from his island prison of Elba and within an hour had met with both the Tsar and the King of Prussia. Metternich wanted no rash change of course, and at first there was little impact on the Congress. Finally, on 13 March the Big Five declared Napoleon an outlaw and the Allies began preparations for renewed fighting. On 25 March they signed a treaty committing each to sending 150,000 men with little sign of their prior divisive stances. After the military commanders left, the Vienna Congress settled down to serious work, fixing the boundaries of an independent Netherlands, formalising proposals for a loose confederation of Swiss cantons, and ratifying earlier agreements over Poland. By late April only two major issues remained, the organisation of a new German federation and the problem of Italy.|$|E
