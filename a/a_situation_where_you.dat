This power, in Magneto's eyes, could be very dangerous to the mutant population, so—in typical Master of Magnetism fashion—he decides to take it for himself. As you can imagine, something like that could very easily start a war between the Inhumans and the mutants. Storm sees this and decides to stand in Magneto's way." [...] In Civil War II: Amazing Spider-Man, Spider-Man helps a precognitive Inhuman use his powers responsibly.

40|$|Research on psychosocial {{health in}} social work isn't {{developed}} enough. Instead, there's much more research on psychosocial unhealth. What about social workers, the unhealth is often related to the situation at work and the work environment. The {{aim of this study}} was to "during interviews understand the factors which social workers experience as important to maintain their own psychosocial health in the life situations". With hermeneutic method the particular interest was directed on how the participants experienced and explained their psychosocial health on the basis of their life situations, and the results was analyzed with Antonovsky's (1991 / 2005) perspective directed on health and Sense of Coherence (SOC). In the study, we used a qualitative form of interviews which allowed our participants to answer with their own words and from how they interpreted the questions. We have made interviews with eight social workers in a average municipality in Sweden. The results are shown qualitatively in current text. With our interest {{in social work}}ers´ psychosocial health, we have understood that it's complicated to make a partition line between the life at work and the private life when it comes to the social workers´ experiences of factors that helps to maintain psychosocial health. Instead, it's about to understand the social worker's psychosocial health as a whole, on the basis of the work as well as the private life. In comparison to research on psychosocial unhealth, our participants said that it's especially the private life, rather than the life at work, that influences and sometimes even controls the psychosocial health in general. Nevertheless, there were plural factors at work which were experienced as especially important to maintain the psychosocial health, for example a "good director", "good colleagues", "ability to let go of the liability for clients" and <b>a</b> working <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> "work two together" plus "experience and knowledge" from the whole life situations. In private life, and in addition to work, the experiences were about "enriching leisure time", social support from friends and family and the ability to make "reasonable demands and limits for yourself" in private life as well as at work...|$|R

40|$|Suppose {{you think}} that whether you believe some {{proposition}} A at some future time t might have a causal influence on whether A is true. For instance, maybe you think a woman can read your mind, and either (1) you think she will snap her fingers shortly after t {{if and only if}} you believe at t that she will, or (2) you think she will snap her fingers shortly after t if and only if you don't believe at t that she will. Let A be the proposition that she snaps her fingers shortly after t. In case (1), theoretical rationality seems to leave it open whether you should believe A or not. Perhaps, for all it has to say, you could just directly choose whether to believe A. David Velleman seems to be committed to something close to that, but his view has been unpopular. In case (2), you seem to be in a theoretical dilemma, <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> any attitude <b>you</b> adopt toward A will be self-undermining {{in a way that makes}} you irrational. Such theoretical dilemmas ought to be impossible, just as genuine moral dilemmas ought to be impossible, but it is surprisingly hard to show that they are (perhaps because they aren't). I study cases analogous to (1) and (2) in a probabilistic framework where degrees of belief rather than all-or-nothing beliefs are taken as basic. My principal conclusions are that Velleman's view is closer to the truth than it is generally thought to be, that case (2) type theoretical dilemmas only arise for hyperidealised agents unlike ourselves, and that there are related cases that can arise for agents like us that are very disturbing but might not quite amount to theoretical dilemma...|$|R
