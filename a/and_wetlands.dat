5|$|The {{yellowhammer}} is a bird of dry open country, preferably with a {{range of}} vegetation types and some trees from which to sing. It is absent from urban areas, forests <b>and</b> <b>wetlands.</b> Probably originally found at forest edges and large clearing, it has benefited from traditional agriculture, which created extensive open areas with hedges and clumps of trees.|$|E
5|$|Upstream of the Interstate 81 crossing, the {{watershed}} of Stafford Meadow Brook is mainly forested and mountainous, with little development.

5|$|A {{study by}} the National Audubon Society has found that populations of some the most common birds in North America have {{plummeted}} since 1967, with some species showing a decline of 80 percent. The {{study also found that}} California species were particularly affected, with population declines of 75 to 96 percent for several species, including the northern pintail, horned lark and loggerhead shrike. The decline may be due to loss of habitat to urban sprawl, especially grasslands, forests <b>and</b> <b>wetlands,</b> energy development and industrialized agriculture. Climate change could compound losses in the future.|$|E

5|$|Although early humans {{gathered}} uncultivated {{plant materials}} {{for food and}} employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing, most modern human use of plants is through agriculture.

5|$|Besides its prairie restorations {{and bodies}} of water, Silver Springs has areas of {{deciduous}} forests, <b>and</b> <b>wetlands,</b> {{both of which}} are populated with species of mammals, birds and insects.

5|$|Despite the {{benefits}} of the Project, many CVP operations have had considerable environmental consequences, including a decline in the salmon population of four major California rivers, and the reduction of riparian zones <b>and</b> <b>wetlands.</b> Many historical sites and Native American tribal lands have been flooded by CVP reservoirs. In addition, runoff from intensive irrigation has polluted rivers and groundwater. The Central Valley Project Improvement Act, passed in 1992, intends to alleviate some of the problems associated with the CVP with programs like the Refuge Water Supply Program.|$|E

However, even though {{it is one of the}} largest urban conglomerations in Europe, almost two-thirds of London is made up of greenspace <b>and</b> <b>wetlands,</b> consisting primarily of extensive areas of green belt, large parks and the Thames basin.

5|$|Hunting {{with lead}} shot, {{along with the}} use of lead sinkers in angling, has been {{identified}} as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes <b>and</b> <b>wetlands</b> where the shot collects. A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and common pochard were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to these environmental problems, Congress passed in 1992 the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA), Title 34 of Public Law 102-575, to change water management practices in the CVP in order to lessen the ecological impact on the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers. Actions mandated included the release of more water to supply rivers <b>and</b> <b>wetlands,</b> funding for habitat restoration work (especially for anadromous fish spawning gravels), water temperature control, water conservation, fish passage, increasing the service area of the CVP's canals, and other items.|$|E

5|$|Near the coast, {{halfway between}} the Quantocks and the Mendips, and lying {{parallel}} to them, is the low ridge of the Polden Hills.

The northeasterly part of the Levels is drained by the Axe and Brue, and the southwesterly part by the Parrett and its main tributary, the Tone. This part of the Levels has traditionally been known as Sedgemoor, and to the east is Glastonbury Tor, an isolated hill projecting from the low-lying plain.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{of these}} {{breeding}} efforts, Finnish horses were widely kept in semi-feral conditions through the mid-19th century. Ethnologist Kustaa Vilkuna describes how all horses regardless or sex and age were let out on forest pastures {{for the summer}} after the spring fieldwork was finished. The pasture was scarce and the terrain challenging, with both rocky ground <b>and</b> <b>wetlands.</b> Vilkuna considers this practice {{an important factor in}} making the Finnhorse an easy-keeping, hardy breed.|$|E
5|$|Reactions {{to the new}} freeway {{were not}} all positive. In a special {{editorial}} in The Grand Rapids Press after the freeway opened in 2004, local resident Curt MacDougall summarized the criticisms of the new freeway. He cited the loss of rural farmland <b>and</b> <b>wetlands</b> as a negative effect of the highway. The editorial also discussed that the freeway does decrease travel times for some residents, but it will mean increased development. That development will mean further urban sprawl, and could spur the creation of additional highways in the area.|$|E

5|$|The coastal {{districts of}} Andhra Pradesh usually {{bear the brunt}} of heavy rains that occur during the {{northeast}} monsoon; with numerous river systems <b>and</b> <b>wetlands,</b> Puducherry and eastern Tamil Nadu are prone to flooding. The city of Chennai alone experienced five major floods between 1943 and 2005, with the 1943, 1978 and 2005 floods causing particularly severe damage. In addition, unplanned and often illegal urban development has led to many wetlands and natural sinks being built over; this, along with ageing civic infrastructure and poorly designed drainage systems, has resulted in an increased frequency of severe flooding.|$|E
