25|$|Psychosis {{may involve}} {{delusional}} beliefs, {{some of which}} are paranoid in nature. Put simply, delusions are false beliefs that a person holds on to, without adequate evidence. It can be difficult to change the belief, even with evidence to the contrary. Common themes of delusions are persecutory (person believes that others <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> harm them), grandiose (person believing that they have special powers or skills), etc. Persons with Ekbom syndrome may have delusional beliefs of an imaginary parasite infestation, whereas depressed persons might have delusions consistent with their low mood (e.g., delusions that they have sinned, or have contracted serious illness, etc.). Karl Jaspers has classified psychotic delusions into primary and secondary types. Primary delusions are defined as arising suddenly and not being comprehensible in terms of normal mental processes, whereas secondary delusions are typically understood as being influenced by the person's background or current situation (e.g., ethnicity; also religious, superstitious, or political beliefs).|$|E

Upon {{returning}} to the Grid, Ruth believes Harry was kidnapped because of a secret operation in which he, MI6 officer Stephen Hillier (Andrew Scarborough), former CIA liaison Libby McCall (Paul Birchard) and Mani intend to vindicate the Iraq War by planting weapons-grade uranium in Baghdad and later [...] "discover" [...] it, though Harry would later pull the operation and safeguard the shipment at a secret location only he and Ruth know; those who kidnapped Harry wish to acquire the uranium to create nuclear weapons. Soon, while being transferred to a safe house, Ruth is captured and brought to Harry, while George and Nico are taken to the safe house unaware of what is happening. To save them, Ruth reveals the uranium is at a base in Norfolk, however Mani reveals he searched the base and it is no longer there, and hence orders George's execution.|$|E
500|$|On August 5, 2011, Guillermo del Toro {{stated that}} the remake would reflect his {{original}} vision for the film, {{and that it had}} been planned even when the first version was in production. [...] "Even when we produced the Spanish movie, I had intended to remake it because we had a very different screenplay that, because of money and time, got turned into the movie you saw – which is great, but there was this other structure for the original script that I wanted to try. So even before we shot the first film it was an economic decision, a pre-existing creative decision, to change it." [...] Del Toro also praised the new film's director. [...] "We have Mark Pellington attached as director – I'm a big fan of his The Mothman Prophecies and his video work – and we <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> actors, so we're hoping to get things going soon." [...] On August 30, 2011, it was reported that American actress Amy Adams was in talks to star as Laura, the main character, who was played by Belén Rueda in the original film. It was also {{stated that the}} current incarnation of the remake screenplay had been written by Larry Fessenden and Sergio G. Sánchez, the sole writer of the original film.|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{nominally}} {{produced the}} Mothers' second album Absolutely Free (1967), which {{was recorded in}} November 1966, and later mixed in New York, although by this time Zappa was in de facto control of most facets of the production. It featured extended playing by the Mothers of Invention and focused on songs that defined Zappa's compositional style of introducing abrupt, rhythmical changes into songs that were built from diverse elements. Examples are [...] "Plastic People" [...] and [...] "Brown Shoes Don't Make It", which contained lyrics critical of the hypocrisy and conformity of American society, {{but also of the}} counterculture of the 1960s. As Zappa put it, [...] "e're satirists, and we <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> satirize everything." [...] At the same time, Zappa had recorded material for an album of orchestral works to be released under his own name, Lumpy Gravy, released by Capitol Records in 1967. Due to contractual problems, the album was pulled. Zappa took the opportunity to radically restructure the contents, adding newly recorded, improvised dialogue. After the contractual problems were resolved, the album was reissued by Verve in 1968. It is an [...] "incredible ambitious musical project", a [...] "monument to John Cage", which intertwines orchestral themes, spoken words and electronic noises through radical audio editing techniques.|$|E

2500|$|Motivations for {{the bombings}} remain unclear. Some, {{such as the}} Australian Prime Minister, have {{suggested}} the attacks were intended to undermine Indonesia's moderate democratic government. Moreover, media organisations {{have suggested that the}} attack was planned to correspond with massive fuel price increases in Indonesia, so as to maximise economic and political damage. On the contrary, Dr Sidney Jones, of the International Crisis Group, believes that it was not an attempt to undermine democracy [...] "per se", but rather an example of jihadist extremism: [...] "I think they very much see the world in a black and white way, us against them, Muslims against infidels... that the infidels led by the United States as part of a Christian-Zionist conspiracy <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> persecute and attack and eliminate Muslims around the world, and therefore, [...] have to run away." [...] However, in common with the Prime Minister, Dr Jones believes the attack was indiscriminate and not an attack on Australians [...] "per se". She suggested Bali was selected as the site of the attacks because there was less chance of Indonesian gangsters being killed, and there was [...] "a chance of getting a few foreigners".|$|E
2500|$|Following Jackson's {{controversial}} Super Bowl halftime show performance incident, conglomerates {{involved with}} the broadcast were heavily fined by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and taken to Supreme Court of the United States for several years.

The boycott was placed into effect prior {{to the release of}} Damita Jo, continuing throughout the course of Jackson's following two albums 20 Y.O. and Discipline.

2500|$|The 1981 film Fort Apache, The Bronx {{is another}} film that used the Bronx's gritty image for its storyline. The movie's title {{is from the}} {{nickname}} for the 41st Police Precinct in the South Bronx which was nicknamed [...] "Fort Apache". Also from 1981 is the horror film Wolfen making use of {{the rubble of the}} Bronx as a home for werewolf type creatures. Knights of the South Bronx, a true story of a teacher who worked with disadvantaged children, is another film also set in the Bronx released in 2005. The Bronx was the setting for the 1983 film Fuga dal Bronx, also known as Bronx Warriors 2 and Escape 2000, an Italian B-movie best known for its appearance on the television series Mystery Science Theatre 3000. The plot revolves around a sinister construction corporation's plans to depopulate, destroy and redevelop the Bronx, and a band of rebels who <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> expose the corporation's murderous ways and save their homes. The film is memorable for its almost incessant use of the phrase, [...] "Leave the Bronx!" [...] Many of the movie's scenes were filmed in Queens, substituting as the Bronx. Rumble in the Bronx was a 1995 Jackie Chan kung-fu film, another which popularised the Bronx to international audiences.

If you go there you are not defining yourself as the Conqueror of this country, but rather as a contributory ally. You should take possession of Djemal Pasha's house, which is the best one in the place, and which they are reserving for Feisal.' He said there was absolute chaos in the city, the Bazaars were closed and all the better class of people were terrified at the idea of the Hejaz crowd being in charge."

The theme of the conference, according to The New York Times, was the [...] "gay agenda": [...] "how to make gay people straight, how gay men often sodomized teenage boys and how 'the gay movement is an evil institution' whose goal is 'to defeat the marriage-based society {{and replace it with a}} culture of sexual promiscuity'". Kapya Kaoma, an Anglican priest from Zambia, was in attendance and reported on the conference. Lively asserted in his workshops that legalizing homosexuality would be akin to accepting child molestation and bestiality. He also claimed that gays threaten society by causing higher divorce rates, child abuse, and HIV transmission. He said that US homosexuals <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> recruit young people into homosexual lifestyles. According to Kaoma, one of the thousands of Ugandans in attendance announced during the conference, [...] " [...] feels it is necessary to draft a new law that deals comprehensively with the issue of homosexuality and ... takes into account the international gay agenda.... Right now there is a proposal that a new law be drafted." ...|$|E
