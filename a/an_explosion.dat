40|$|In {{this chapter}} we review the {{evidence}} for and against three claims: that (1) {{there is a substantial}} chance we will create human-level AI before 2100, that (2) if human-level AI is created, {{there is a good chance}} vastly superhuman AI will follow via <b>an</b> “intelligence <b>explosion,</b> ” and that (3) <b>an</b> uncontrolled intelligence <b>explosion</b> could destroy everything we value, but <b>a</b> controlled intelligence <b>explosion</b> would benefit humanity enormously if we can achieve it. We conclude with recommendations for increasing the odds of <b>a</b> controlled intelligence <b>explosion</b> relative to <b>an</b> uncontrolled intelligence <b>explosion...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Big Bang is not <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> {{of matter}} moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, space itself expands with time {{everywhere}} {{and increases the}} physical distance between two comoving points. In other words, the Big Bang is not <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> in space, but rather an expansion of space. Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.|$|E
5|$|The worst mining {{disaster}} in the town occurred at Yew Tree Colliery on 11 December 1858 when <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> of firedamp caused by a safety lamp cost 25 lives, the youngest victim was 11, and the oldest, 35 years of age. Some of the victims are buried in the churchyard at St George's Church. Another explosion on 6 March 1877 at Great Boys Colliery cost eight lives and on 2 October 1883, six men died when the cage rope broke at Nelson Colliery in Shakerley. On 1 October 1895 five men including the colliery manager and undermanager died at Shakerley Colliery after <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> of firedamp.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{theory to}} the corpse's identity was {{suggested in the}} history The Secrets of HMS Dasher (2004). This suggested that in March 1943 there was <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> on , which sank, killing 379 men; one of these corpses was purportedly used. The military historian Denis Smyth dismisses the suggestion, and observes that the official records of the operation state that Michael was the body.|$|E
5|$|As {{a powder}} {{or in the}} form of metal shavings, {{titanium}} metal poses a significant fire hazard and, when heated in air, <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> hazard. Water and carbon dioxide are ineffective for extinguishing a titanium fire; Class D dry powder agents must be used instead.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the mine}} was successful, and {{considered}} one of the safest in the region, <b>an</b> underground <b>explosion</b> in 1914 (Canada's worst mine disaster) killed 189 men—almost twenty percent of the town's population, and half the mine's workforce. <b>A</b> further <b>explosion</b> in 1926 killed two men.|$|R
5|$|Computer {{models have}} been very {{successful}} at calculating the behavior of TypeII supernovae when the shock has been formed.
