40|$|Access to {{straightforward}} yet robust {{tools to}} quantify the impact of renewable energy resources on air emissions from fossil fuel power plants is important to governments aiming to improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gases at least cost. It {{is also important to}} renewable energy developers seeking to gather support and facilitate permitting of their projects. Due to the inherent complexities of the electric power system, {{it is difficult to determine}} the effects of renewable energy generators on emissions from fossil fuel power plants. Additionally, because there are a variety of methods for calculating "avoided emissions," which differ in complexity and transparency, and which provide dissimilar results, there remains uncertainty in estimating <b>avoided</b> <b>emissions.</b> Guidance from government authorities on which method to use is too flexible to provide a robust framework to enable decision makers to evaluate environmental solutions. This thesis informs decision making first by highlighting important issues to consider when analyzing the impact of renewable energy resources on emissions, then by reviewing current guidance on the matter, and finally by comparing existing methods of calculating <b>avoided</b> <b>emissions.</b> Several methods are further evaluated by applying them to potential offshore wind energy resources in New England, including the proposed Cape Wind project. (cont.) This analysis suggests that the potential <b>avoided</b> <b>emissions</b> of the Cape Wind project are significant, though lower than previously stated by the project developers and supporters. The usefulness of the available literature on calculating <b>avoided</b> <b>emissions</b> suggests that governments and electric industry analysts should continue to share information on different methods and work together to revise the current guidance. To further increase analytical capacity, government agencies should collect, organize, and disseminate more data on the electricity system including power plant operations and emissions. The ability to accurately quantify <b>avoided</b> <b>emissions</b> will help policymakers design programs with the right incentives to reduce emissions from power plants and will enable them to describe the environmental benefits of doing so. To facilitate development of clean energy resources, it is proposed that more weight is given to environmental benefits such as <b>avoided</b> <b>emissions</b> in environmental impact assessments. To assist in reducing emissions, it is recommended that renewable energy and energy efficiency resources are allowed to participate more directly in emissions markets. by Michael Peter Berlinski.

In a second set of experiments, we apply an additional aid which consists in rewarding sequestered emissions rather than <b>avoided</b> <b>emissions.</b> In other words, CO 2 emissions from the CCS implementation are not taken into account anymore.

40|$|In the Netherlands, waste {{electric}} and electronic equipment (e-waste) {{is an important}} point for discussion on the circular economy agenda. This paper shows the Dutch example of how “waste” {{can be turned into}} a resource, and the climate change benefits from appropriate collection and recycling. It describes the <b>avoided</b> <b>emissions</b> of CO 2 -equivalents due to e-waste recycling and appropriate removal and destruction of (H) CFCs contained in cooling and freezing appliances. Six different e-waste categories were included, and the results of 2016 were compared to previous years (2009 – 2015). In 2016, 110, 000 tonnes of e-waste were collected. 80 % of this was recycled to useful materials. Additionally, it resulted in 17 % energy recovery. That year, the recycling of e-waste and the removal of (H) CFKs resulted in approximately 416, 000 tonnes of <b>avoided</b> <b>emissions</b> of CO 2 -equivalents. Although the phasing out of cooling and freezing appliances with (H) CFKs led to a general decrease in the quantity of avoided CO 2 emissions over time, removal of (H) CFKs still explained most of the avoided CO 2 emissions. Material recycling appeared particularly beneficial for cooling and freezing appliances and small and large household appliances.

I would also like to acknowledge the contribu-tions made by participants in a roundtable discussion of an earlier draft of this paper chaired by Kemal Derviş of the Brookings Institution. This paper examines five different low and no-carbon electricity technologies and presents the net benefits of each under a range of assumptions. It estimates the costs per megawatt per year for wind, solar, hydroelectric, nuclear, and gas combined cycle electricity plants. To calculate these estimates, the paper uses a methodology based on <b>avoided</b> <b>emissions</b> and avoided costs, rather than comparing the more prevalent “levelized ” costs. Three key findings result: First—assuming reductions in carbon emissions are valued at $ 50 per metric ton and the price of natural gas is $ 16 per million Btu or less—nuclear, hydro, and natural gas combined cycle have far more net benefits than either wind or solar. This is the case because solar and wind facilities suffer from a very high capacity cost per megawatt, very low capacity factors and low reliability, which result in low <b>avoided</b> <b>emissions</b> and low avoided energy cost per dollar invested. Second, low and no-carbon energy projects are most effective in avoiding emissions if a price for carbon is levie...|$|E
