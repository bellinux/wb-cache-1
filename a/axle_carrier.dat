5000|$|For the '87+ model, the {{swingarm}} {{design was}} changed to a more [...] "beefy" [...] design after cracking / breaking issues with the 85-86 swingarm design. Clearly, the Suzuki engineers underestimated how hard their customers could ride their product. However, the '87+ swingarm will mount to the 85-86 frame with some other minor equipment swap (i.e. rear shock, link). The '87+ rear <b>axle</b> <b>carrier</b> includes forward-reverse slide chain tensioning rather than the 85-86's rotary tensioning method. The '87+ carrier housing slides forward and reverse and then is {{held in place by}} four vertical bolts and two rear horizontal bolts whereas the 85-86 carrier was held with a clamp or pinch design.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{apparent}} attention to weight by engineers, {{it came with}} many aluminum parts: swing arm, rear <b>axle</b> <b>carrier,</b> engine cases, front spindles, rear shock link. But the overall advantage in weight (compared to most other quads) is the simplicity of design. The '85 and '86 Quadracers are known as the lightest production full size race quads ever built, tipping the scales at only 293 lbs dry making them similar to the 250cc two stroke race three wheelers of that era. (They were actually lighter than the Yamaha Tri-Z, slightly heavier than the Kawasaki Tecate 3, and identical in weight to the Honda ATC250R.) ...|$|E
50|$|The Slash 4X4 Ultimate {{is a step}} up {{from the}} {{original}} Slash 4X4. The Ultimate utilizes the Low-CG chassis that was designed for the 4X4 platform. It also features a host of factory-installed accessories such as aluminum <b>axle</b> <b>carriers</b> and steering blocks, telemetry sensors, sway bars, and GTR shocks. The Slash 4X4 Ultimate was built to be the balance between race track competition and backyard fun.|$|R

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} design of <b>axle</b> <b>carrier</b> for Formula Student. The <b>axle</b> <b>carrier</b> is topologically {{optimized}} and additively manufactured with Selective Laser Melting technology. Material for its production is aluminium alloy AlSi 10 Mg, which has worse mechanical properties than commonly used high-strength alloys. Therefore the aim was, by using topology optimization, {{to design a}} component, which would have comparable properties with milled component. The stress strain analysis {{was carried out by}} the finite element method and maximum deformation and safety coef-ficients were acquired. The prototype was made and its dimensions were controlled by optical digitization, which proved accuracy of manufacturing. The strength calcu-lations were verified by special testing device and photogrammetry measurement. The load during the tests was 20 % higher than in the analysis and no limit state was observed. This verified its safety and functionality...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{competition}} in the market, ever increasing demands of products and delivery of the quality product within committed dates forcing the manufacturers to involve newer and more optimized techniques in their production scheduling. This technique either involves costly Automation and Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) or the techniques forcing on elimination of unnecessary and unproductive operation (i. e. motion) during the production. An assembly line is designed by determining the sequences of operations for manufacture of each component {{as well as the}} final product. In this paper, a case study at one of leading tractor manufacturing company in India for one of its production operation i. e. assembly of Rear <b>Axle</b> <b>Carrier</b> (Transmission System) of tractor is presented using the technique of time and motion study. For this technique such as Predetermined Motion Time Study (PMTS), Method Time Measurement (MTM), various process charts are used for analysis and optimize their present methodology of assembling Rear <b>Axle</b> <b>Carrier</b> (RAC) ...|$|E

The object is Weiler Primus lathe located in Sam Ratulangi (Unsrat) engineering manufacturing laboratory. Examination covered five measurements, which is harmonization to the machine base and sledge, motion alignment head move off relatively against the sledge movement, accuracy of the main spindle, alignment of rote launcher axis fuse and the <b>axle</b> <b>carrier</b> 2 ̆ 7 s accuracy due to keming in the bearing press. Measurement of the five tests were done because of the limitation of measuring tools which can support the other measurements. The result of deviation value obtained from the test will be compared with allowed deviation value based on ISO- 1708 standard. The measurement result of the five types of tests shows that Weiler Primus 2 ̆ 7 s lathe located in Unsrat engineering laboratory is conform with ISO 1708 standard. In other words, the late posses the ability and reliability to produce a product or tool with high accuracy with an average reliability of 99, 370...|$|E

5000|$|Kristine Valdresdatter was a three-axle railcar, with a bogie at {{the front}} and a <b>carrier</b> <b>axle</b> at the back. It had a [...] Buda {{gasoline}} prime mover with a mechanical transmission. The train was built on a steel chassis with a wood and aluminum body. It had a low floor height, easing entry, giving a low center of gravity and thus better driving properties. It weighed 9.7 t and had a maximum speed of 100 km/h.The overall length was 13.33 m, and 12.80 m without buffers. The train had a seating capacity for 40 plus 5 folding seats in the driver's cab.|$|R
5000|$|Released in late 2009 the Traxxas Slash 4x4, a {{four-wheel drive}} one tenth scale short-course {{electric}} race truck and it features Traxxas' first all new one tenth scale platform since the Jato {{was introduced in}} 2005. Contrary to its name, the Slash 4x4 has almost no parts commonality with the two-wheel drive Slash, and the Slash VXL 1/16. The parts carried over from the two-wheel drive Slash to the Slash 4x4 are limited to the shocks, springs, and the rear drive shafts and <b>axle</b> <b>carriers,</b> otherwise, the Slash 4x4 is a completely new design from the ground up. Its central chassis is a semi rectangular unit molded from gray plastic featuring triangular reinforcements throughout. It also features a four-wheel independent unequal length double wishbone suspension with four oil filled coilover shocks and progressive rate springs in staggered lengths ("long" [...] up front; [...] "XXlong" [...] in back). The new suspension will also be capable of mounting front and rear sway bars (available as a Traxxas accessory). It is powered by the same [...] "Velineon 3500" [...] 10 turn 3500kV brushless motor and [...] "Velineon VXL-3S" [...] non-waterproof 320 (rated burst) amp brushless ESC as the two-wheel drive family VXL models. In February 2010 all versions of VXL systems were sold as waterproof, however the Slash 4x4 does not bear the VXL moniker like Traxxas' other Velineon powered models. The driveline design is very different than that featured on any other Traxxas model. The motor is mounted longitudinally in the M4 layout driving a spur gear that directly turns (no transmission), via a Revo spec slipper clutch, the main one piece hollow aluminum drive shaft. The drive shaft sends power {{to the front and}} rear viscous limited slip differentials, which send power to the wheels through plastic telescoping half shafts. The Slash 4x4 features a similar exterior appearance to the two-wheel drive Slash, including a similar short course style body, bumpers, nerf bars, and wheels. Other notable features include scale replica BFGoodrich Mud-Terrain T/A tires with white lettering, 2.2 inch satin chrome beadlock style [...] "SCT" [...] wheels, a new heavy duty ball bearing steering system, digital waterproof high torque steering servo, Traxxas high current connectors, 2.4Ghz radio system, and hex hardware used throughout. With the stock motor/ESC combo the claimed top speed is 35 to 65+MPH depending on the battery and gearing used. Traxxas also advertises the Castle Creations Mamba Monster Brushless system (featured on the E-Revo/E-Maxx Brushless Edition and available as a Traxxas accessory) as a direct [...] "drop in" [...] replacement for the stock Velineon system, and it is claimed to be capable of powering the Slash 4x4 to speeds in excess of 80MPH.|$|R
