40|$|As {{is often}} the case with a work of genius, Pierre Schlag 2 ̆ 7 s The Enchantment of Reason is both stunningly {{impressive}} and maddeningly perplexing. It cuts to the heart of all that happens within the legal academy (and sometimes beyond) by identifying our central, and, according to Pierre, highly implausible, premise. Legal academicians {{and other members of the}} culture in which we thrive speak 2 ̆ 2 as if 2 ̆ 2 life 2 ̆ 7 s most difficult challenges are generally <b>amenable</b> <b>to</b> <b>reasoned</b> solutions. Pierre then thrills us with a deft display of the shallowness of such a poorly disguised conceit. His reasoning is so good, his questions so incisive, and his conclusions to inescapable, that after reading The Enchantment of Reason, an intellectually honest person would be hard-pressed to continue participation in the business as usual game of the American legal academy. This, I gather, is one of Pierre 2 ̆ 7 s goals. But Pierre 2 ̆ 7 s book is cryptic, even silent, on the question of how to escape rather than merely to describe the paradoxes and riddles he illuminates. My fear then is that too many will come away from the book with their academic practices intact, acting 2 ̆ 2 as if 2 ̆ 2 Pierre hadn 2 ̆ 7 t said anything at all. In this brief essay, I will address those who would dismiss Pierre 2 ̆ 7 s work as cynical and woefully short on positive program. I will explain why I find not merely analytical clarity but political passion in Pierre 2 ̆ 7 s work. And I will explicitly call upon Pierre to take up the challenges his own work suggests for all those wishing to turn such passion toward useful projects in twenty-first century America...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we enrich FIEVeL (a {{modelling}} language for institutions <b>amenable</b> <b>to</b> model checking) with new constructs to describe norms and sanctions. Moreover, {{we present a}} specification language <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> {{about the effectiveness of}} norms and sanctions in shaping agent interactions. Finally we show that when properties of artificial institutions reflect certain interpretations of norms of human institutions, it is not always possible to satisfy them. As a consequence, regimentation of norms is not always a viable solution. ...|$|R

500|$|For a {{decision}} by a body <b>to</b> be <b>amenable</b> <b>to</b> judicial review, United Kingdom and Singapore law requires the decision to have some public element, and not to relate exclusively to private law matters. The public element is determined by considering if the body's power stems from a legal source (the [...] "source test"), or if {{the nature of the}} body is that it is carrying out some public function (the [...] "nature test"). If the power exercised by a body has a legislative source, it will ordinarily be <b>amenable</b> <b>to</b> judicial review in the absence of compelling <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> the contrary, but this is not an invariable rule and decisions without a sufficient public element will not be <b>amenable</b> <b>to</b> review. The latter is also the result when a body is regarded has having acted pursuant to a contract between it and the aggrieved party, rather than having exercised its statutory powers.|$|R

But that which I call right or goodness, is the choice of my constitution; and that which I call heaven, and inwardly aspire after, is the state or circumstance desirable to my constitution; and the action which I in all my years tend to do, is the work for my faculties.

40|$|We {{develop a}} formal account of complex group-level epis-temic {{modalities}} {{in the situation}} calculus, with a particular focus on reasoning about common knowledge. Expressions involving common knowledge cannot be handled by standard regression techniques and are thus difficult <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> about effectively. Taking our cue from recent promising work in dynamic epistemic logic, we overcome this limitation by in-creasing the expressive power of the epistemic language. The syntax of first-order dynamic logic is used to form complex epistemic modalities from the individual-level knowledge op-erators. Common knowledge is a special case of this syntax, using the unbounded iteration operator. We develop a regres-sion rule for these complex modalities and demonstrate its use <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> about common knowledge in an example domain. The result is a rich multi-agent theory of knowledge and ac-tion in which complex group-level epistemic modalities are <b>amenable</b> <b>to</b> effective automated reasoning...|$|R

60|$|Captain Aylmer had {{no answer}} to make to all this. It was, no doubt, the fact that age and good living had made Sir Anthony {{altogether}} incapable of enjoying {{the kind of life}} which he desiderated, and that he would probably have eaten and drunk himself into his grave long since had that kind of life been within his reach. This, however, the son could not explain to the father. But in fitting, as he endeavoured to do, his father's words to his own case, Captain Aylmer did perceive that a bachelor's life might perhaps be the most suitable to his own peculiar case. Only he would do nothing unhandsome. As to that he was quite resolved. Of course Clara must show herself to be in some degree <b>amenable</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> and to the ordinary rules of the world; but he was aware that his mother was hot-tempered, and he generously made up his mind that he would give Miss Amedroz even yet another chance.|$|E

60|$|Now it is a universally {{observed}} {{fact that}} the two evil dispositions in question, the disposition to prefer a man's selfish interests to those which he shares with other people, and his immediate and direct interests to those which are indirect and remote, are characteristics most especially called forth and fostered by the possession of power. The moment a man, or a class of men, find themselves with power in their hands, the man's individual interest, or the class's separate interest, acquires an entirely new degree of importance in their eyes. Finding themselves worshipped by others, they become worshippers of themselves, and think themselves entitled to be counted at a hundred times the value of other people, while the facility they acquire of doing as they like without regard to consequences insensibly weakens the habits which make men look forward even to such consequences as affect themselves. This {{is the meaning of}} the universal tradition, grounded on universal experience, of men's being corrupted by power. Every one knows how absurd it would be to infer from what a man is or does when in a private station, that he will be and do exactly the like when a despot on a throne; where the bad parts of his human nature, instead of being restrained and kept in subordination by every circumstance of his life and by every person surrounding him, are courted by all persons, and ministered to by all circumstances. It would be quite as absurd to entertain a similar expectation in regard to a class of men; the Demos, or any other. Let them be ever so modest and <b>amenable</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> while there is a power over them stronger than they, we ought to expect a total change in this respect when they themselves become the strongest power.|$|E

6000|$|The {{burden of}} his {{position}} was so heavy on Lord Fawn's mind that, on the Monday morning after leaving Fawn Court, he was hardly as true to the affairs of India as he himself would have wished. He was resolved {{to do what was}} right,--if only he could find out what would be the right thing in his present difficulty. Not to break his word, not to be unjust, not to deviate by a hair's breadth from that line of conduct which would be described as [...] "honourable" [...] in the circle to which he belonged; not to give his political enemies an opportunity for calumny,--this was all in all to him. The young widow was very lovely and very rich, and it would have suited him well to marry her. It would still suit him well to do so, if she would make herself <b>amenable</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> and the laws. He had assured himself that he was very much in love with her, and had already, in his imagination, received the distinguished heads of his party at Portray Castle. But he would give all this up,--love, income, beauty, and castle,--without a doubt, rather than find himself in the mess of having married a wife who had stolen a necklace, and who would not make restitution. He might marry her, and insist on giving it up afterwards; but he foresaw terrible difficulties in the way of such an arrangement. Lady Eustace was self-willed, and had already told him that she did not intend to keep the jewels in his house,--but in her own! What should he do, so that no human being,--not the most bigoted Tory that ever expressed scorn for a Whig lord,--should {{be able to say that}} he had done wrong? He was engaged to the lady, and could not simply change his mind and give no reason.
