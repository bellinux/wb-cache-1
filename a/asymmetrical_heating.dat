The use of such a combination of devices maximizes the efficiency of the channel heat exchanger. The efficiency is characterized by two criteria: one based on the turbulent kinetic energy and another one based on the Nusselt number and the friction coefficient. The comparison of those two criteria allows separating the heat transfer intensification due to turbulence and exchange surface enhancement. Several heights of DWVGs and various sizes and shapes of downstream riblets are simulated using a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach. The numerical results show that bigger and thinner riblets provide the best thermal performance. Concerning the DWVGs, a half-channel height is found to be the optimum...|$|E

Previous findings, from computational biology (Ota, N.; Agard, D. A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005, 351, 345 - 354), have proposed that heat diffuses in a protein through cognate protein allosteric pathways. This work studied heat diffusion in the well-known PDZ- 2 protein, and confirmed that this protein has two cognate allosteric pathways and that heat flows preferentially through these. Also, a new property was also observed for protein structures: heat diffuses asymmetrically through the structures. The underling structure of this <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>heat</b> flow was a normal length hydrogen bond (similar to 2. 85 angstrom) that acted as a thermal rectifier.

40|$|The flowfield {{characteristics}} in rocket engine coolant channels are analyzed {{by means of}} a numerical model. The channels are characterized by large length to diameter ratios, high Reynolds numbers, and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>heating.</b> At representative flow conditions, the channel length is approximately twice the hydraulic entrance length so that fully developed conditions would be reached for a constant property fluid. For the supercritical hydrogen that is used as the coolant, the strong property variations create significant secondary flows in the cross-plane which have a major influence on the flow and the resulting heat transfer. Comparison of constant and variable property solutions show substantial differences. In addition, the property variations prevent fully developed flow. The density variation accelerates the fluid in the channels increasing the pressure drop without an accompanying increase in heat flux. Analyses of the inlet configuration suggest that side entry from a manifold can affect the development of the velocity profile because of vortices generated as the flow enters the channel.

40|$|In this work, natural {{convection}} heat transfer in vertical channels is experimentally investigated by applying different optical techniques, namely holographic interferometry and schlieren. Both these techniques {{are based on}} the temperature-dependence of the air refractive index but they detect different optical quantities and their use involves different instrumentation and optical components. Optical methods, non-intrusive in nature, are particularly suitable for the visualization of flow and thermal fields as witnessed by their increasing use in a range of scientific and engineering disciplines; for this reason the introduction of these experimental tools into a laboratory course can be of high value. Physics and engineering students can familiarise with optical techniques, grasp the basics of thermal phenomena, usually elusive, which can be more easily understood if they are made visible and begin to master digital image analysis, a key skill in laboratory activities. A didactic description of holographic interferometry and schlieren is provided and experimental results obtained for vertical, smooth and rib-roughened channels with <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>heating</b> are presented.

Through the testing using various prototype hybrid loops, it was demonstrated that the hybrid loops were capable of removing high heat fluxes from multiple heat sources with large surface areas up to 135 cm and 10 kW heat load. Because of the passive capillary phase separation, the hybrid loop operation didn’t require any active flow control of the liquid in the evaporator, even at highly transient and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>heat</b> inputs between the evaporators.

In this study, the influence of symmetrical and <b>asymmetrical</b> non-uniform <b>heat</b> flux distribution boundaries {{in terms of the}} gravitational field on the internal heat transfer coefficient and the friction factor in a horizontal circular tube was investigated numerically. Of interest was buoyancy driven flow in the laminar flow regime. Inlet fluid temperature and external loss convective heat transfer was also considered. Three-dimensional steady-state numerical simulations were performed using ANSYS Fluent version 14. Circumferential non-uniform heat flux was simulated as a sinusoidal function of the heat flux incident on the tube. A steel tube was considered which had a wall thickness of 5. 2 mm, a length-to-inner-diameter ratio of 160, and a thermal conductivity of 16. 27 W/mK. The results showed that the average internal heat transfer coefficients and friction factors for the symmetrical non-uniform heat flux distribution cases were higher than that of the asymmetrical case considered. The heat transfer coefficient also increased with an increase in the inlet fluid temperature for the uniform heat flux, symmetrical and <b>asymmetrical</b> nonuniform <b>heat</b> flux distributions cases. However, the average internal heat transfer coefficient decreased with the increase in the external loss convective heat transfer coefficient. It was found that the friction factor decreased with increase in the fluid inlet temperature and external loss convective heat transfer coefficient for the uniform heat flux, symmetrical and <b>asymmetrical</b> non-uniform <b>heat</b> flux distributions cases. dc 201...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Thermal {{behavior}} of fuel channel under {{loss of coolant accident}} (LOCA) {{is a major}} concern for nuclear reactor safety. LOCA along with failure of emergency cooling water system (ECC) may leads to mechanical deformations like sagging and ballooning. In order to understand the phenomenon an experiment has been carried out using 19 pin fuel element simulator. Main purpose of the experiment was to trace temperature profiles over the pressure tube, calandria tube and clad tubes of Indian Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (IPHWR) under symmetrical and asymmetrical heat-up conditions. For simulating the fully voided scenario, symmetrical heating of pressure was carried out by injecting 13. 2 KW (2 % of nominal power) to all the 19 pins and the temperatures of pressure tube, calandria tube and clad tubes were measured. During symmetrical heating the sagging of fuel channel was initiated at 460 oC and the highest temperature attained by PT was 650 oC. The decay heat from clad tubes was dissipated to moderator mainly by radiation and natural convection. The highest temperature of 680 oC was observed over the outer ring of clad tubes of fuel simulator. Again, to simulate partially voided condition, <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>heating</b> of pressure was carried out by supplying 8. 0 kW power to upper 8 pins of fuel simulator and temperature profiles were measured. Along the circumference of pressure tube (PT) the highest temperature difference of 320 oC was observed, which highlights the magnitude of thermal stresses under partially voided conditions...|$|E
40|$|LectureThe {{increasing}} demand of higher efficiency and increased equipment compactness {{is pushing the}} modern rotordynamic design towards higher and higher bearing peripheral speeds. Due to the increased viscous dissipation, fluid film bearings are prone {{to the development of}} rotor <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>heating</b> (de Jongh 1994) and hence thermal rotor bowing, rotor thermal imbalance and consequent synchronous vibration increase. Differential heating and synchronous rotor vibrations are directly linked leading to a complex feedback loop which can cause thermal rotor instability often referred as Morton effect (de Jongh 1994). In the present work, the stability of a rotor bearing system is numerically simulated following two different approaches: a classical linear stability approach suggested by Murphy et al. (Murphy 2009) and an iterative FEM thermo-structural-dynamic analysis. Results are compared with measurements obtained during an experimental campaign carried out at the GE oil & Gas facility in Florence on a real scale between-bearing dummy rotor. During the experiments, the rotor differential temperature at the journal bearing section has been continuously monitored via telemetry as well as rotor vibration at bearing, mid span and overhung location. For the linear stability approach, the rotor differential temperature is estimated by making use of a steady thin-film tilting pad journal bearing (TPJB) code developed at the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Florence while the iterative method takes advantage of an experimentally fit correlation between rotor vibration and differential rotor temperature used to couple the dynamic and thermo-structural rotor simulations...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{concept of}} a hybrid Thermosyphon/Pulsating Heat Pipe with a {{diameter}} bigger than the capillary limit is tested both on ground and in hyper/micro gravity conditions during the 61 st ESA Parabolic Flight Campaign. The device is filled with FC- 72 (50 % vol.) and it is made of an aluminum tube (I. D. 3 mm) bent into a planar serpentine with five curves at the evaporator zone, while a transparent section closes the loop, allowing fluid flow visualizations in the condenser zone. Five heaters, mounted alternatively in the branches just above the curves at the evaporator zone, provide an <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>heating</b> thus promoting the fluid flow circulation in a preferential direction. The device has been tested at different positions (vertical and horizontal) and at different heat power input levels (from 10 W to 160 W). Ground tests show that effectively the device works as a thermosyphon when gravity assisted: in vertical position the device can reach an equivalent thermal resistance of 0. 1 K/W with heat fluxes up to 17 W/cm 2. In hor- izontal position the fluid motion is absent, thus the device works as a pure thermal conductive medium. The parabolic flight tests point out a PHP working mode: during the micro-gravity period, the sudden absence of buoyancy force activates an oscillating slug/plug flow regime, typical of the PHP operation, allowing the device to work also in the horizontal position. In some cases the hyper-gravity period is able to eliminate partial dry-outs restoring the correct operation until the occurrence of the next microgravity period...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Currently {{there is}} a great amount of {{interest}} in the phenomena of natural circulation as a cooling mechanism for normal operation as well as emergency conditions in nuclear reactors and spent fuel pools. In order to better understand this phenomena for the specific geometry of vertical, heated rods in water, an experimental facility was designed and constructed at Oregon State University. This facility, named the Laser-Imaged Natural Circulation (LINC) facility, consists of a water tank capped with a custom cooling plate through which two heated rods pass into the tank. The LINC facility enables flow patterns in the channel between the heated rods to be imaged and quantified using particle image velocimetry (PIV). This paper presents the reasoning and theory behind the design of the LINC facility, as well as a characterization of the thermodynamics, boundary layer thickness and velocity profile progression of the system. The thermodynamic analysis consists of bulk equilibrium temperatures and heat removal rates for 3 cases where the two heater rods have equal power levels (dubbed "symmetrical heating"). The boundary layer thickness analysis consists of a test matrix of 5 test cases including symmetrical and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>heating</b> in which the thickness of the boundary layer is measured using the velocity field between the heater rods. The velocity profile analysis centered on an effective vertical length of 100 mm along the entrance region between the two rods at one symmetrical rod power.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{numerical model}} is developed and validated {{to study the}} effect of geometric parameters such as microchannel depth and width, manifold depth, and manifold inlet and outlet lengths {{on the performance of}} a manifold microchannel (MMC) heat sink. The manifold arrangement used to distribute the flow through alternating inlet and outlet pairs greatly reduces the pressure drop incurred in conventional fluid supply arrangements due to its shorter flow paths, while simultaneously enhancing the heat transfer coefficient by limiting the growth of thermal boundary layers. The computational analysis is performed on a simple unit-cell model to obtain an optimized design for uniform thermal boundary conditions, as well as on a porous-medium model to obtain a complete system-level analysis of multiple microchannels across one manifold. The porous-medium approach can be further modified to analyze the performance under <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>heating</b> conditions. Along with conventional deterministic optimization, a probabilistic optimization study is performed to identify the optimal geometric design parameters that maximize heat transfer coefficient while minimizing pressure drop for an MMC heat sink. In the presence of uncertainties in the geometric and operating parameters of the system, this probabilistic optimization approach yields a design that is robust and reliable, in addition to being optimal. Such an optimization analysis provides a quantitative estimate of the allowable uncertainty in input parameters for acceptable uncertainties in the relevant output parameters. The approach also yields information such as the local and global sensitivities which are used to identify microchannel width and manifold inlet length as the critical input parameters to which the outputs are most sensitive. The deterministic analysis shows that the heat transfer performance of the MMC heat sink is optimal at a manifold inlet to outlet length ratio of 3. A comparison between the deterministic and probabilistic optimization approaches is presented for the unit-cell model. A probabilistic optimization study is performed for the porous-medium model and the results thus obtained are compared with those of the unit-cell model for a uniform heat flux distribution...|$|E

We consider the flow of a Newtonian fluid through a narrow annular space between two asymmetrically-heated concentric micro-cylinders where the inner cylinder is rotating at a constant speed. Employing an analytical methodology, we demonstrate the temperature distribution and its consequential effects on the heat-transfer and entropy-generation behaviour in the annulus.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with heat flow asymmetry through composites of water and aqueous solutions. Central to this exploration are the behaviour of heat transfer {{in the vicinity of}} the density maximum and the behaviour of the temperature of maximum density of aqueous solutions. Both of these topics are investigated by cooling a rectangular enclosure of the test fluid in a quasi-steady state manner. During cooling, the temperature at select points within the liquid is monitored and the flow of heat at both isothermal walls is measured. As the liquid cools through its density maximum the normal single-cell convection that occurs in the presence of a horizontal temperature gradient changes to a double cell configuration {{in the vicinity of the}} density maximum. This transition manifests itself in changes in the horizontal temperature profile across the cavity and in the rate of cooling of the fluid. A measurement technique to study the behaviour of the temperature of maximum density of aqueous solutions is described in this thesis that relies on these changes. These changes are investigated experimentally and numerically. The study of the behaviour of heat transfer and the temperature of maximum density of aqueous solutions revealed that heat transfer is reduced in the vicinity of the density maximum and that the temperature of maximum density of aqueous solutions depends on the nature and concentration of the solute. Both of these results are exploited in the study of heat flow asymmetry through a device that consists of two cubic enclosures side by side; one enclosure contains water with a density maximum at 4 oC and the other enclosure contains a saline solution with a density maximum at 2 oC. A temperature gradient, which spans both of these temperatures of maximum density, is applied horizontally across the composite system, resulting in different rates of heat transfer through the device depending on the gradient direction. Experiments performed with a 12 cm x 6 cm x 6 cm container yield heat transfer rates of 0. 55 W and 0. 19 W depending on the direction of the temperature gradient, resulting in a rectification factor of 65. 4 %. <b>Asymmetrical</b> <b>heat</b> transfer rates are also found in composite systems of water and solids when the temperature gradient spans the temperature of maximum density of the water. Results from computational fluid dynamics confirm the experimental results, and are used to investigate the influence of such parameters as temperature gradient and container aspect ratio on the rectification factor...|$|R
40|$|<b>Asymmetrical</b> {{and lower}} <b>heat</b> {{transport}} {{caused by the}} cladding strip during twin-roll casting (TRC) of clad sheet makes the process window narrow compared with traditional TRC. The effect of pouring temperature on process stability is more remarkable when it is relatively high under high casting speed and casting speed becomes a leading factor when its value is low. The inter-diffusion zone width at the Al/Fe interface depends on the solid/semi-solid contacting time. The longer the time is, the wider the inter-diffusion zone. A widest zone of 3. 8 μm is attained under condition of casting speed of 1. 25 m/min and pouring temperature of 720 °C. Bonding strength of clad sheet by TRC depends on inter-diffusion zone width and rolling reduction. Proper combinations of inter-diffusion zone width and rolling reduction can result in same high bonding strength. The highest bonding strength of 16 N/mm is attained under a combination of rolling reduction of 29 % and inter-diffusion zone of 3. 7 μm. The wetting of aluminum melt on steel surface is uneven and insufficient {{as a result of}} short contacting time in TRC. As a result, same rolling reduction in TRC induces lower bonding strength than in roll bonding process.
