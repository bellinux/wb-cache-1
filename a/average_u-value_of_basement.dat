To better understand the impact of policy instruments and to provide insights into technology change, assessments of various kinds are needed. This study analyzes the introduction and development of energy efficient windows in Sweden and the policy incentives applied to support this process. The study focuses on the assessment of technology and market development of energy efficient windows in Sweden; and by applying the concept of learning, it assesses how conditions for learning-by-searching, learning-by-doing, learning-by-using and learning-by-interacting have been supported by different policies. The results show successful progress in technology development and an improvement in best available technology of Swedish windows from 1. 8 W/m 2 K in the 1970 s to 0. 7 W/m 2 K in 2010; in the same time period the market share of energy efficient windows increased from 20 % in 1970 (<b>average</b> <b>U-value</b> <b>of</b> 2. 0 W/m 2 K) to 80 - 85 % in 2010 (<b>average</b> <b>U-value</b> <b>of</b> 1. 3 - 1. 2 W/m 2 K).

The optimization variables arethe building envelope properties, the lighting system properties and the HVACsystem selection.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{implementation}} of energy-saving measures (ESM) in existing building stocks from an energy systems perspective. The effects of the measures are assessed in terms of net and delivered energy levels, carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions, and the costs for implementing the measures. For this assessment, a bottom-up engineering energy balance model was developed that facilitates modelling of an entire building stock, i. e., the Energy, Carbon and Cost Assessment for Building Stocks (ECCABS) model. The model was validated by modelling a residential building in Sweden and an office building in Spain, and {{by comparing the results}} from the model developed in this work with the measurements and results from a detailed heat balance model. The simplified model gives satisfactory results. When the model was applied to 1400 buildings that were chosen as being representative of the Swedish residential building stock, the results showed good agreement with the available statistics on energy use in the Swedish residential building stock. Application of the investigated ESM would reduce the net energy demand of the Swedish residential sector by 55 %. The measures that would provide the greatest savings are installation of heat recovery systems (22 %) and reduction of the indoor temperature (14 %). The ECCABS model indicated that the upgrading <b>of</b> the <b>U-value</b> <b>of</b> <b>basements</b> and the <b>U-value</b> <b>of</b> facades and the replacement of windows would provide an annual energy saving of about 7 % each. The net potential reductions in CO 2 emissions arising from {{the implementation of}} the ESM would be low, since the energy supply in Sweden generally associated with low levels of CO 2 emissions. In addition, measures that reduce the electricity for lighting and appliances would increase CO 2 emissions, since the electricity saved is less CO 2 -intensive than the fuel mix used for the corresponding increase in space heating. The model is also applied to evaluate the profitability of ESM for the Swedish residential stock under different scenarios {{for the development of the}} energy system, particularly with respect to the prices of energy carriers used as fuels in the buildings. Three scenarios were investigated: a baseline scenario that assumes current energy prices and a continuation of the present trends in energy use, and two climate change mitigation scenarios. Already in the Baseline scenario, energy use could be reduced by 30 % by implementing profitable ESM, whereas the climate change mitigation scenarios generate only modest increases in profitable energy reduction in spite of higher energy prices. The most profitable ESM are the same in all three scenarios and they involve: (1) a reduction by 50 % of electricity for lighting and appliances; (2) a reduction of indoor temperature down to 20 ºC; and (3) heat recovery for single-family dwellings. In contrast, the modelling reveals that the replacement of existing hydropumps with more efficient ones and the retrofitting of the building envelope are the most expensive ESM. The three scenarios give similar average annual costs for the ESM for the period 2010 - 2050. However, it cannot be expected that all of the cost efficiency potentials described in this thesis will be seized. Thus, further work is required to investigate how the energy-saving potentials identified in this work can be implemented...|$|R

Such measures increase the thermal insulation of the envelope and reduce the energy need for space heating, but also reduce the daylight availability, due to the lower visible transmittance of highly insulated windows. This drawback may have strong effect in Norway, where the daylight availability in the winter season is little. This paper investigates into the consequences on energy use for space heating and electricity use for lighting given by the substitution of existing windows with highly insulated windows in Norwegian residential buildings.

Experimental investigations have been performed on south facing walls with a glazing unit composed of two 4 mm glass panes and a 12 mm layer of granulated aerogel sandwiched in between.

There are periods with very high amounts of surplus heat, and there are also times that allow only for a reduction of transmission losses.

Phase 1 was a steady state model of the greenhouse environment based {{on a series of}} energy and mass balances. The temperatures within the greenhouse and the quantity of heat required to hold the house at a specified set point were predicted by solving these balances simultaneously. This process enabled the <b>average</b> <b>U-value</b> for each greenhouse to be estimated. In Phase 2 of the model the annual heat load for combinations of each house size and type, cover, screen, set point, and location were estimated using <b>average</b> <b>U-values</b> from Phase 1 and meterological data indicative of Auckland and Christchurch. Using current fuel prices, annual heat loads were converted into annual heating expenditures. Using annual heating expenditure, screen life expectancy, and screen installation cost an economic analysis was conducted using internal rate of return as a measure of thermal screen feasibility. In terms of savings in heating expenditure, Black Polythene, Infrane, and Clear Polythene recorded the highest internal rate of return. It was decided that before a formal recommendation could be made further research was required to evaluate screens as summer shading or photoperiod control devices and to consider the practical problems associated with some of the screens. It was shown that returns from thermal screening were greater in Christchurch than Auckland, greater at a 20 °C set point than at a 15 °C set point, greater for a 1000 m 2 house than a 300 m 2 house, greatest with diesel heating in Auckland, and greatest with diesel and L. P. G. heating in Christchurch...|$|R
