The activities of the community building were planned to overlap and to coalesce, as a one-stop destination for the entire family. The rich congruence of the multiple programmes for the building is expressed architecturally as a collage of diverse elements. The building was designed by a local architectural firm, William Lim Associates, which adopted a postmodern pluralist approach, expressed through <b>a</b> <b>multiplicity</b> <b>of</b> materials and forms.|$|E
5|$|The vault of {{the nave}} rises steeply {{in a simple}} quadripartite form, {{in harmony with the}} nave arcade.

The vault has <b>a</b> <b>multiplicity</b> <b>of</b> ribs in a net-like form, which is very different from that of the nave, and is perhaps a recreation in stone of a local type of compartmented wooden roof of which examples remain from the 15th century, including those at St Cuthbert's Church, Wells. The vaults of the aisles of the choir also have a unique pattern.|$|E

Therefore, we defined a scalar product to the subset of real space, and we proved some relating lemmas. At last, we proved <b>a</b> scalar <b>multiplicity</b> <b>of</b> Riemann definite integral. As a result, a linearity of Riemann definite integral was proven by unifying the previous article [11]. MML Identifier:INTEGRA 2...|$|R

25|$|There have {{traditionally}} been several races at each event for various classes of motorcycles, based on engine size, and one class for sidecars. Classes for 50 cc, 80cc, 125cc, 250cc, 350cc, and 500cc solo machines have existed at some time, and 350cc and 500cc sidecars. Up through the 1950s {{and most of the}} 1960s, four-stroke engines dominated all classes. In part this was due to rules, which allowed <b>a</b> <b>multiplicity</b> <b>of</b> cylinders (meaning smaller pistons, producing higher revs) and <b>a</b> <b>multiplicity</b> <b>of</b> gears (giving narrower power bands, affording higher states of tune). In the 1960s, two-stroke engines began to take root in the smaller classes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We study two {{bilateral}} multi-issue bargaining procedures {{with complete}} information and endogenous agenda, where each issue {{is associated with}} a finite set of alternatives. In both procedures, when bargaining frictions are small, we find <b>a</b> large <b>multiplicity</b> <b>of</b> equilibrium agreements, including ones with arbitrarily long delays. Thus, this paper extends the previous results of van Damme et al. (1990) and Muthoo (1991) for the single-issue case to multi-issue cases. Furthermore, we show that in the first procedure (issue-by-issue bargaining), the stationary subgame perfect equilibria alone may support <b>a</b> large <b>multiplicity</b> <b>of</b> inefficient agreements. Confronting a recent study, this implies that {{it is not necessary to}} appeal to “strictly controversial ” issues in a bargaining problem in order to find multiplicity and delay in agreements...|$|R

25|$|Temperature has <b>a</b> <b>multiplicity</b> <b>of</b> {{effects on}} plants {{depending}} {{on a variety}} of factors, including the size and condition of the plant and the temperature and duration of exposure.
