25|$|When Susan Richards {{experienced}} {{problems with}} her second pregnancy while Reed was away, Johnny contacted Doom for help, correctly guessing that Doom {{will be unable}} to pass up a chance to succeed where Reed failed (due to the complex events involving the then-recent resurrection of Galactus, this pregnancy is a 'repeat' of an earlier one where Sue miscarried). Doom not only saves Sue's daughter but also cured Johnny of a recent problem with his powers where Johnny was unable to 'flame off' without technological support after becoming overcharged with energy from the Negative Zone by channeling Johnny's excess energy into Sue to keep her alive. After the birth, Doom's only <b>apparent</b> <b>condition</b> for his aid is that he be allowed to name Sue and Reed's daughter, calling her 'Valeria' after his long-lost love. However, this inspires a new plan where Doom makes Valeria his familiar while seeking out her namesake as part of a deal with a trio of demons; by sacrificing his old lover, Doom is granted magical powers on the level he would possess if he had spent the past years studying sorcery rather than science. With this new power, Doom trapped Franklin in Hell, immobilised Doctor Strange, and then neutralises the FF's powers, torturing the other three while taunting Reed by leaving him in his magical library, comparing it to giving a dog a road-map as he concluded that it would be impossible for Reed to master sufficient magical skill to be a threat to him. However, Reed was able to release Doctor Strange's astral self from Doom's traps, allowing Strange to give Reed a sufficient crash-course in magic for Reed to free {{the rest of the team}} and trick Doom into angering his demonic benefactors, prompting them to take him to Hell. Determined to ensure that Doom cannot be a further threat, Reed takes control of Latveria to dismantle all of Doom's equipment, simultaneously subtly driving his family away so that he can trap Doom and himself in a pocket dimension so that he can make sure Doom never threatens anyone again. However, this plan backfires when the rest of the team attempt to rescue Reed, resulting in Doom transferring his spirit into Sue, Johnny and Ben respectively, forcing Reed to kill his best friend to stop his greatest enemy. Doom was returned to Hell, but Reed is later able to use the same machine Doom once tried to create to travel to Heaven and restore Ben to life. Doom remained in Hell until Mjolnir falls to Earth after the events of Ragnarok as it creates a dimensional tear during its fall that allows Doom to escape, although he decides to focus on rebuilding his power base when he proves unable to even lift the hammer. The events of this were deleted from Marvel Comics continuity in the 2015 series Secret Wars.|$|E

6000|$|For a {{considerable}} time after this, I published no work of magnitude; though I still occasionally wrote in periodicals, and my correspondence (much {{of it with}} persons quite unknown to me), on subjects of public interest, swelled to {{a considerable}} bulk. During these years I wrote or commenced various Essays, for eventual publication, {{on some of the}} fundamental questions of human and social life, with regard to several of which I have already much exceeded the severity of the Horatian precept. I continued to watch with keen interest the progress of public events. But it was not, on the whole, very encouraging to me. The European reaction after 1848, and the success of an unprincipled usurper in December, 1851, put an end, as it seemed, to all present hope for freedom or social improvement in France and the Continent. In England, I had seen and continued to see many of the opinions of my youth obtain general recognition, and many of the reforms in institutions, for which I had through life contended, either effected or in course of being so. But these changes had been attended with much less benefit to human well-being than I should formerly have anticipated, because they had produced very little improvement in that which all real amelioration in the lot of mankind depends on, their intellectual and moral state: and it might even be questioned if the various causes of deterioration which had been at work in the meanwhile, had not more than counterbalanced the tendencies to improvement. I had learnt from experience that many false opinions may be exchanged for true ones, without in the least altering the habits of mind of which false opinions are the result. The English public, for example, are quite as raw and undiscerning on subjects of political economy since the nation has been converted to free-trade, as they were before; and are still further from having acquired better habits of thought and feeling, or being in any way better fortified against error, on subjects of a more elevated character. For, though they have thrown off certain errors, the general discipline of their minds, intellectually and morally, is not altered. I am now convinced, that no great improvements in the lot of mankind are possible, until a great change takes place in the fundamental constitution of their modes of thought. The old opinions in religion, morals, and politics, are so much discredited in the more intellectual minds as to have lost the greater part of their efficacy for good, while they have still life enough in them to be a powerful obstacle to the growing up of any better opinions on those subjects. When the philosophic minds of the world can no longer believe its religion, or can only believe it with modifications amounting to an essential change of its character, a transitional period commences, of weak convictions, paralysed intellects, and growing laxity of principle, which cannot terminate until a renovation has been effected in the basis of their belief leading to the evolution of some faith, whether religious or merely human, which they can really believe: and when things are in this state, all thinking or writing which does not tend to promote such a renovation, is of very little value beyond the moment. Since there was little in the <b>apparent</b> <b>condition</b> of the public mind, indicative of any tendency in this direction, my view of the immediate prospects of human improvement was not sanguine. More recently a spirit of free speculation has sprung up, giving a more encouraging prospect of the gradual mental emancipation of England; and concurring with the renewal under better auspices, of the movement for political freedom in the rest of Europe, has given to the present condition of human affairs a more hopeful aspect.[3] ...|$|E

Therefore, by using the mash ration, animals received long particle size roughage, whereas in case of pelletized ration, animals received ground pellet roughage more closely resembles a concentrate feed in terms of particle size that may resulted in a greater feed efficiency.

40|$|Conditioned {{inhibition}} {{occurs when}} a stimulus inhibits the responses that would normally occur to a conditioned stimulus that previously predicted an outcome of interest (the unconditioned stimulus, which elicits responding unconditionally). The present study tested inhibitory learning using emotionally salient cues provided {{by the use of}} pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). The procedure in use was adapted to confirm the demonstration of conditioned inhibition using two key transfer tests, retardation and summation. Experiment 1 showed the development of the predicted discrimination learning for negative outcomes but not for positive outcomes. Experiment 2 found evidence for retardation. Furthermore, this reduced learning was clearly related to the conditioned emotional response to the US images; individuals rated transfer images as positive if they had previously signalled the absence of a negative outcome. Experiment 3 showed that the conditioned inhibition was confirmed by summation test. Thus, inhibitory learning was confirmed by both retardation and summation tests, which between them control for alternative explanations of <b>apparent</b> <b>conditioned</b> inhibition, conducted on different participants but using the same discrimination learning procedure.

Since the economic reforms were instituted in the late 1970 s, the financing and delivery of rural health services have seen many changes, some positive, others not. Most CMSs have collapsed. In the absence of CMSs, the rural population has to pay for health care out-of-pocket and poor families have greater difficulty in getting access to essential health care. In the meantime, emphases of health services have tended to shift from lower to higher levels, from preventive to curative services, and from planning and management to market forces.

40|$|I {{will defend}} a {{traditional}} analysis of extraposition as rightward movement to a right-adjoined position. 1 This movement {{occurs in the}} narrow syntax and does not check any features (except perhaps an EPP feature). I begin in § 2 by giving arguments against PF movement analyses. The lack of a featural motivation for extraposition has the consequence that it is underspecified with regard to its A/A′ status, given certain other assumptions outlined in § 3. As a result, it is subject to Minimality effects in both the A and A ′ domains. A number of predictions are thereby made regarding “freezing ” effects and the adjunction height of extraposed phrases; these are worked out in § 3. 1 and § 3. 2. In § 4, I consider {{the implications of the}} analysis for the constituent structure of vP/VP.
