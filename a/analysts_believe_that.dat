5|$|After {{five years}} with San Diego, Hamilton {{was traded to}} the Toronto Blue Jays on December 12, 1998, for Peter Tucci, Carlos Almanzar, and Woody Williams. <b>Analysts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Toronto {{acquired}} Hamilton if Roger Clemens's trade request was successful. Hamilton began the 1999 season with the Syracuse SkyChiefs, the Triple-A affiliate of the Blue Jays. He started three games, recording one loss, no wins, and a 5.11 ERA in 12 innings pitched. The Blue Jays called him up, and Hamilton made 18 starts in 22 games pitched. Pitching in 98 innings, he went 78 with a 6.52 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{investigation}} {{did not find}} any considerable evidence linking Kocharyan to the Hunanyan group, many Armenian politicians and <b>analysts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> President Robert Kocharyan and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan were behind the assassination of Vazgen Sargsyan and other leading politicians. In January 2000, investigators alleged that several members of the President Robert Kocharian's inner circle may have been behind the October 27 shooting, promoting some opposition figures to call for Kocharian's resignation. However, Kocharyan gradually consolidated his power throughout the year to emerge as the most powerful figure in the country's leadership.|$|E

40|$|The psychoanalytic {{conflict}} surrounding lay {{and medical}} analysis {{was a prominent}} conflict within both the European and American psychoanalytic communities. This thesis is an analysis of that conflict from the time period of 1900 - 1940. I argue that this conflict {{is an expression of}} two conflicting ideas for the disciplinary identity of psychoanalysis. Lay <b>analysts</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> psychoanalysis should be a distinct discipline and be used in a multidisciplinary context. Medical <b>analysts</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> through aligning psychoanalysis with medicine it would obtain professional legitimacy. This thesis also covers concepts of professionalization in disciplines...|$|R
5|$|Modern <b>analysts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the Italian {{campaign}} {{failed because}} Mussolini and his generals initially allocated insufficient {{resources to the}} campaign (an expeditionary force of 55,000 men), failed to reckon with the autumn weather, attacked without the advantage of surprise and without Bulgarian support. Elementary precautions such as issuing winter clothing had not been taken. Mussolini had not considered the warnings of the Italian Commission of War Production, that Italy {{would not be able}} to sustain a full year of continuous warfare until 1949.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, Kenealy instigated {{a popular}} radical reform movement, the Magna Charta Association, which championed the Claimant's cause for some years. Kenealy {{was elected to}} Parliament in 1875 as a radical {{independent}} but was not an effective parliamentarian. The movement was in decline when the Claimant was released in 1884, {{and he had no}} dealings with it. In 1895, he confessed to being Orton, only to recant almost immediately. He lived generally in poverty {{for the rest of his}} life and was destitute at the time of his death in 1898. Although most commentators have accepted the court's view that the Claimant was Orton, some <b>analysts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> an element of doubt remains as to his true identity and that, conceivably, he was Roger Tichborne.|$|E
5|$|Gov. Schwarzenegger again {{appealed to}} the Supreme Court, looking to {{overturn}} the Ninth Circuit's ruling, filing a writ of certiorari to the Court in May 2009. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, at this point filed as Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n. The fact that the Court accepted this case was considered surprising, based on the previous case record for such violent video game laws that were unanimously overturned in other states. <b>Analysts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> because the Court agreed to hear this case, there are unanswered questions between the protection of free speech from the First Amendment, and the legal enforcement of protecting minors from unprotected free speech such as through restrictions on the sales of pornography to minors. Just a week prior to {{the acceptance of the}} certiorari, in United States v. Stevens the Court overturned another law that sought restrictions on depictions of animal cruelty, which some analysts felt would reflect the Court's position to likely overturn the violent video game law.|$|E

25|$|The {{print media}} in India and abroad was largely {{sympathetic}} to the Indian cause, with editorials in newspapers based {{in the west and}} other neutral countries observing that Pakistan was largely responsible for the conflict. Some <b>analysts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Indian media, which was both larger in number and more credible, may have acted as a force multiplier for the Indian military operation in Kargil and served as a morale booster. As the fighting intensified, the Pakistani version of events found little backing on the world stage. This helped India gain valuable diplomatic recognition for its position.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} UBS, {{reported}} on April 12, 2011, predicts that around 30 nuclear plants may be closed worldwide, with those located in seismic zones {{or close to}} national boundaries being {{the most likely to}} shut. The <b>analysts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> 'even pro-nuclear countries such as France will be forced to close at least two reactors to demonstrate political action and restore the public acceptability of nuclear power', noting that the events at Fukushima 'cast doubt on the idea that even an advanced economy can master nuclear safety'. In September 2011, German engineering giant Siemens announced it will withdraw entirely from the nuclear industry, {{as a response to the}} Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan.|$|E

25|$|Though Viacom {{continued}} {{to support the}} series throughout 2010, it {{announced that it was}} seeking a buyer for Harmonix, citing the series' continued profit losses and Viacom's inexperience at being a video game publisher. Harmonix was eventually sold at the end of 2010 to Harmonix-SBE Holdings LLC, an affiliate of investment firm Columbus Nova, LLC that included Harmonix shareholders. Though the net liability of the sale was valued at nearly $200 million, including existing unsold inventory and ongoing music license fees, <b>analysts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Harmonix-SBE paid only $50 for the company, taking on the total financial liability that Viacom was able to write off in their books. The MTV Games division at Viacom was later closed.|$|E
25|$|However, many <b>analysts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{even though}} the TFX project itself was a failure, McNamara was {{ahead of his time}} as the trend in fighter design has {{continued}} toward consolidation — the F-16 Falcon and F/A-18 Hornet emerged as multi-role fighters, and most modern designs combine many of the roles the TFX would have had. In many ways, the Joint Strike Fighter is seen as a rebirth of the TFX project, in that it purports to satisfy the needs of three American Air arms (as well as several foreign customers), fulfilling the roles of strike fighter, carrier-launched fighter, V/STOL, and close air support (and drawing many criticisms similar to those leveled against the TFX).|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Air Force {{has made}} plans to retire the A-10 Thunderbolt II, with its close air support mission to be {{initially}} covered by F-16s and F-15Es until it can transition to the F-35A. An inexpensive replacement aircraft may be considered to perform CAS against enemies without sophisticated air defenses. <b>Analysts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the Scorpion {{will be difficult to}} sell to the Air Force; Textron AirLand believes it can sell without a requirement or lengthy competition. Budget cuts make new programs unattractive, and its missions of irregular warfare, border patrol, maritime surveillance, emergency relief, counter narcotics, and air defense operations are performed by RPAs. However, the Air Force pursued fully developed aircraft, excluding the Scorpion that lacked data on the cost of sustainment.|$|E

25|$|The {{election}} of Donald Trump (2017) has {{coincided with the}} country's attempt at globalization with increasing pipeline exports and LNG shipments.>. He also has plans to revive the fossil fuel industry with his America First Energy Plan. In respect to natural gas, this plan will attempt to “take advantage of the estimated $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, especially those on federal lands that the American people own.” However, even though Trump plans on opening some of these lands closed to drilling, <b>analysts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> this would not only be difficult with all the regulation but also would not increase revenue as much Trump believes it would. Trump also plans on eliminating Obama's Climate Action Plan and all its regulations.|$|E
25|$|The lockout had a {{substantial}} effect on international tournaments {{run by the}} International Ice Hockey Federation. The most notable effect was observed in the 2005 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and Thief River Falls, Minnesota. With the NHL inactive, the top eligible U-20 players were not playing in that league and thus were available to their countries for the tournament. The country that benefitted most as a result was Canada. The Canadians not only ended a seven-year gold medal drought at this competition, they outscored their opponents 41–7 and defeated Russia 6–1 in the final game. Many <b>analysts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the Canadian team was the most dominating ever in this tournament, aided {{in no small part}} by players such as Patrice Bergeron who could have expected to have commitments in the NHL.|$|E
25|$|In a major {{split in}} the ranks of Al Qaeda's organization, the Iraqi franchise, known as Al Qaeda in Iraq covertly invaded Syria and the Levant and began {{participating}} in the ongoing Syrian Civil War, gaining enough support and strength to re-invade Iraq's western provinces under the name of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS/ISIL), taking over much of the country in a blitzkrieg-like action and combining the Iraq insurgency and Syrian Civil War into a single conflict. Due to their extreme brutality and a complete change in their overall ideology, Al Qaeda's core organization in Central Asia eventually denounced ISIS and directed their affiliates to cut off all ties with this organization. Many <b>analysts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> because of this schism, Al Qaeda and ISIL are now in a competition to retain the title of the world's most powerful terrorist organization.|$|E
