5|$|In {{the course}} of normal immune response, parts of {{pathogens}} (e.g. bacteria) are recognized by the immune system as foreign (non-self), and eliminated or effectively neutralized to reduce their potential damage.

The antibodies are soluble and do not require direct cell-to-cell contact between the pathogen and the B-cell to function.|$|E

5|$|LACM 149371 is {{a poorly}} {{preserved}} molar-like tooth that largely lacks <b>a</b> <b>recognizable</b> enamel surface and shows many small grooves and holes on the crown surface.

The roots are broken off, but remaining pulp cavities suggest the presence of four main roots, which are partially joined into two pairs. A smaller pulp cavity between those roots suggests the likely presence of a fifth root and a slight depression in the tooth may represent another root.|$|E
