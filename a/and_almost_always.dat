5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Israelis drink wine in moderation, <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> at meals or social occasions. Israelis drink about 6.5 liters of wine per person per year, which is low compared to other wine-drinking Mediterranean countries, but the per capita amount has been increasing since the 1980s as Israeli production of high-quality wine grows to meet demand, especially of semi-dry and dry wines. In addition to Israeli wines, {{an increasing number of}} wines are imported from France, Italy, Australia, the United States, Chile and Argentina.|$|E
5|$|By 1147, Nigel {{was again}} {{witnessing}} Stephen's charters, and in 1153 or 1154 {{he was named}} in a grant of lands to St Radegund's Priory in Cambridge. He assisted with the consecration of Hilary of Chichester as Bishop of Chichester in August 1147. He took part in shire courts in both Norfolk and Suffolk in 1150, and continued to assist with episcopal consecrations throughout the remainder of Stephen's reign. No records exist of him being involved with treasury affairs during this time. His witnessing of charters is sparse, <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> in company with other bishops; this suggests {{that he was only}} at court for councils or other similar events. Nigel was a witness to Stephen's charter that left England to Matilda's son, Henry of Anjou. When Henry succeeded Stephen, Nigel was present at the coronation.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{location}} at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation. This {{means that it}} is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a desert) <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.|$|E

5|$|The most {{extensive}} early study of female homosexuality {{was provided by}} the Institute for Sex Research, who published an in-depth report of the sexual experiences of American women in 1953. More than 8,000 women were interviewed by Alfred Kinsey and the staff of the Institute for Sex Research in a book titled Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, popularly known as part of the Kinsey Report. The Kinsey Report's dispassionate discussion of homosexuality as a form of human sexual behavior was revolutionary. Up to this study, only physicians and psychiatrists studied sexual behavior, <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> the results were interpreted with a moral view.|$|E
5|$|World-class {{match play}} (i.e., {{a series of}} games between the same two opponents) often {{involves}} one or both players preparing one or two openings very deeply, and playing them repeatedly during the match. Preparation for such a match also involves analysis of those opening lines known to be played by the opponent. Fischer had been famous for his unusually narrow opening repertoire: for example, almost invariably playing 1. as White, <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> playing the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defence as Black against 1.e4. He surprised Spassky by repeatedly switching openings, and by playing openings that he had never, or only rarely, played before (such as 1. as White, and Alekhine's Defence, the Pirc Defence, and the Paulsen Sicilian as Black). Even in openings that Fischer had played before in the match, he continually deviated from the variations he had previously played, almost never repeating the same line twice in the match.|$|E
5|$|Although group 12 {{lies in the}} d-block of {{the modern}} 18-column {{periodic}} table, the d electrons of zinc, cadmium, <b>and</b> (<b>almost</b> <b>always)</b> mercury behave as core electrons and do not take part in bonding. This behavior {{is similar to that}} of the main-group elements, but is in stark contrast to that of the neighboring group 11 elements (copper, silver, and gold), which also have filled d-subshells in their ground-state electron configuration but behave chemically as transition metals. For example, the bonding in chromium(II) sulfide (CrS) involves mainly the 3d electrons; that in iron(II) sulfide (FeS) involves both the 3d and 4s electrons; but that of zinc sulfide (ZnS) involves only the 4s electrons and the 3d electrons behave as core electrons. Indeed, useful comparison can be made between their properties and the first two members of group 2, beryllium and magnesium, and in earlier short-form periodic table layouts, this relationship is illustrated more clearly. For instance, zinc and cadmium are similar to beryllium and magnesium in their atomic radii, ionic radii, electronegativities, and also in the structure of their binary compounds and their ability to form complex ions with many nitrogen and oxygen ligands, such as complex hydrides and amines. However, beryllium and magnesium are small atoms, unlike the heavier alkaline earth metals and like the group 12 elements (which have a greater nuclear charge but the same number of valence electrons), and the periodic trends down group 2 from beryllium to radium (similar to that of the alkali metals) are not as smooth when going down from beryllium to mercury (which is more similar to that of the p-block main groups) due to the d-block and lanthanide contractions. It is also the d-block and lanthanide contractions that give mercury many of its distinctive properties.|$|E

25|$|After 1720, piracy in {{the classic}} sense became {{extremely}} rare as increasingly effective anti-piracy measures were taken by the Royal Navy {{making it impossible for}} any pirate to pursue an effective career for long.

25|$|Radiographers, {{also known}} as radiologic technologists, {{diagnostic}} radiographers and medical radiation technologists are healthcare professionals who specialise in the imaging of human anatomy for the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} pathology. Radiographers are infrequently, <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> erroneously, known as x-ray technicians. In countries which use the title radiologic technologist they are often informally referred to as techs in the clinical environment; this phrase has emerged in popular culture such as television programmes.|$|E
25|$|When P. aeruginosa is {{isolated}} from a normally sterile site (blood, bone, deep collections), {{it is generally}} considered dangerous, <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> requires treatment. However, P. aeruginosa is frequently {{isolated from}} nonsterile sites (mouth swabs, sputum, etc.), and, under these circumstances, it may represent colonization and not infection. The isolation of P. aeruginosa from nonsterile specimens should, therefore, be interpreted cautiously, and {{the advice of a}} microbiologist or infectious diseases physician/pharmacist should be sought prior to starting treatment. Often, no treatment is needed.|$|E

25|$|Whether or not {{literary}} criticism {{should be considered}} a separate field of inquiry from literary theory, or conversely from book reviewing, is a matter of some controversy.
