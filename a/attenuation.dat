5|$|Bridging wires are rods that couple {{together}} resonators {{that are}} not adjacent. They {{can be used to}} produce poles of <b>attenuation</b> in the stopband. This has the benefit of increasing the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the passband edge, it also has the benefit of increasing roll-off and narrowing the transition band. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11. Bridging across a single resonator (figure 11b) can produce a pole of <b>attenuation</b> in the high stopband. Bridging across two resonators (figure 11c) can produce a pole of <b>attenuation</b> in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of <b>attenuation.</b> In this way, the <b>attenuation</b> of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.|$|E

40|$|We {{treat the}} problem of {{minimizing}} sum transmit power for a fading multiple-access channel. While for nonfading channels with equal user <b>attenuations</b> wideband multi-access with joint decoding and orthogonal access are both optimal, wideband access is superior in case of unequal <b>attenuations</b> or fading channels. The loss of orthogonal access can be reduced by applying non-uniform resource sharing among the users. Wideband access with single-user decoding is clearly suboptimal in any case and only useful for low transmission rates...|$|R
5|$|Telecommunication and {{broadcast}} networks {{can be affected}} by volcanic ash in the following ways: <b>attenuation</b> and reduction of signal strength; damage to equipment; and overloading of network through user demand. Signal <b>attenuation</b> due to volcanic ash is not well documented; however, {{there have been reports}} of disrupted communications following the 1969 Surtsey eruption and 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. Research by the New Zealand-based Auckland Engineering Lifelines Group determined theoretically that impacts on telecommunications signals from ash would be limited to low frequency services such as satellite communication. Signal interference may also be caused by lightning, as this is frequently generated within volcanic eruption plumes.|$|E

5|$|Darlington {{additionally}} used {{a transformation}} found by Hendrik Bode that predicted {{the response of}} a filter using non-ideal components but all with the same Q. Darlington used this transformation in reverse to produce filters with a prescribed insertion-loss with non-ideal components. Such filters have the ideal insertion-loss response plus a flat <b>attenuation</b> across all frequencies.|$|E
5|$|During {{sunrise and}} sunset, {{sunlight}} is attenuated because of Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering from a particularly long passage through Earth's atmosphere, and the Sun is sometimes faint {{enough to be}} viewed comfortably {{with the naked eye}} or safely with optics (provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds). Hazy conditions, atmospheric dust, and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric <b>attenuation.</b>|$|E

40|$|Anti-resonant hollow-core fibers are {{optical fiber}} waveguides which exhibit very low dispersion, high damage {{threshold}} and ultra-low nonlinear response. However, they typically deliver {{the light in}} several spatial modes, whereas their application usually requires that they support a single spatial mode. We report the principles, fabrication, demonstration and characterization of anti-resonant hollow-core fibres with strong differential modal <b>attenuations</b> and low overall <b>attenuations.</b> These fibers perform as single-mode and are eminently suitable for delivery of powerful ultrashort optical pulses in machining, cutting, welding and multiphoton microscopy applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{inversion}} of the acoustic properties of gassy sediments presents the optimum manner {{of determining the}} in situ distribution of sediment-based methane bubbles. An in situ device that measures both compressional wave <b>attenuations</b> and combination-frequency components in gassy sediment lying within 2 m of the seabed has been developed at the University of Southampton. This device was deployed at an inter-tidal site along the South coast of England. Compressional wave <b>attenuations</b> were measured from 10 to 100 kHz though the analysis of propagation signals transmitted {{from a variety of}} sources to a buried co-linear hydrophone array, with propagation distances spanning 0. 5 to 2 m. Measured <b>attenuations</b> were inverted to infer in situ bubble size distributions using both established and new acoustic models for gassy sediment.

40|$|In this article, {{elastic wave}} {{propagation}} and scattering in a solid medium permeated by uniaxially aligned penny-shaped microcracks are studied. The crack alignment {{refers to the}} {{case in which the}} unit normals of all cracks are randomly oriented within a plane of isotropy. The analysis is restricted to the limit of the noninteraction approximation among individual cracks. Explicit expressions for <b>attenuations</b> and wave speeds of the shear horizontal, quasilongitudinal, and quasishear vertical waves are obtained using stochastic wave theory in a generalized dyadic approach. The ensemble average elastic wave response is governed by the Dyson equation, which is solved in terms of the anisotropic elastic Green’s dyadic. The analysis of expressions is limited to frequencies below the geometric optics limit. The resulting <b>attenuations</b> are investigated in terms of the directional, frequency, and damage dependence. In particular, the <b>attenuations</b> are simplified considerably within the low frequency Rayleigh regime. Finally, numerical results are presented and discussed in terms of the relevant dependent parameters...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a genetic algorithm selection technique of appropriate transmission wavelengths in the line-of sight (LOS) optical wireless channel, under different weather conditions. The overall deterministic <b>attenuations</b> are usually presented {{in an international}} code of visibility model, and the changes in visibility decide about the wavelength control margin. However, the proposed work suggests a comprehensive method that analyses non-uniform weather conditions, and specifies a practical range that the genetic algorithm can work in. The paper considers the fact that instantaneous <b>attenuations</b> are not stable and they form a variable link margin that should be analytically studied for perfect wavelength selection...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{minimizing}} sum transmit power for a fading multiple-access channel is considered. While for non-fading channels with equal user <b>attenuations</b> wideband multi-access with cooperative (joint) decoding and orthogonal access are both optimal, wideband access is superior {{in case of}} unequal <b>attenuations</b> or fading channels. Losses due to fading are negligible for wideband access {{as a result of}} low rate coding, and near AWGN perfomance is achievable. On the other hand, orthogonal access su ers from losses of high rate codes under fading conditions. Wideband access with non-cooperative decoding is clearly suboptimal in any case and only useful for low transmission rates...|$|R
25|$|<b>Attenuation</b> {{in fiber}} optics, {{also known as}} {{transmission}} loss, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) as it travels through the transmission medium. <b>Attenuation</b> coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the relatively high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is usually a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. <b>Attenuation</b> {{is an important factor}} limiting the transmission of a digital signal across large distances. Thus, much research has gone into both limiting the <b>attenuation</b> and maximizing the amplification of the optical signal.|$|E
25|$|The term {{absorption}} {{refers to}} the physical process of absorbing light, while absorbance does not always measure absorption: it measures <b>attenuation</b> (of transmitted radiant power). <b>Attenuation</b> {{can be caused by}} absorption, but also reflection, scattering, and other physical processes.|$|E
