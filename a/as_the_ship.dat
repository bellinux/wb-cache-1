5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise-D. In this episode, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> is en route to an interplanetary conference with delegates from the Selay and Antican races on board, a non-corporeal alien entity takes possession of various Enterprise crew members, including Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart).|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Lindemann {{may have}} left his combat {{position}} when the ship's controls were rendered inoperable, and {{prior to the}} lethal hit on the command position, {{in order to give}} the command to abandon the ship. The surviving Matrose Paul Hillen—who had managed to escape to the upper deck in the final phase of the battle, stated that he had seen a group of 20–30 people standing at the bow, among them a man with a white peaked cap. Normally on a German naval vessel at sea, a white cap is worn only by the commanding officer. In addition, the surviving Maschinengefreiter—Rudolf Römer, who at the time was already in the water—claimed that he had seen Lindemann standing on the bow, near Bismarcks forward 38cm turret, Anton. He was said to be with his combat messenger, a leading seaman, and apparently trying to persuade his messenger to save himself. In this account, his messenger took Lindemann's hand and the two walked to the forward flagmast. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> turned over, the two stood briefly to attention, then Lindemann and his messenger saluted. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> rolled to port, the messenger fell into the water. Lindemann continued his salute while clinging to the flagmast, going under with the ship.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> reaches Treasure Planet, Jim overhears {{that the}} crew are pirates, and mutiny erupts. Jim, Doppler, Amelia, and Morph abandon the ship, but Morph has left the map behind. Thinking that Jim has the map, Silver {{has a chance to}} blast Jim, but hesitates because of his {{attachment}} to the boy. The fugitives are shot down by a mutineer during their escape, injuring Amelia.|$|E

5000|$|In the Royal Navy, a flag {{captain was}} {{the captain of}} an admiral's flagship. During the 18th and 19th centuries, this ship might also have a [...] "captain of the fleet", who would be ranked between the admiral and the [...] "flag captain" [...] <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> [...] "First Captain", with the [...] "flag captain" [...] <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> [...] "Second Captain".|$|R

5|$|Captain Salmond rushed on {{deck and}} ordered the anchor to be dropped, the quarter-boats to be lowered, and a turn astern to be given by the engines. However, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> backed off the rock, the sea rushed into the large hole made by the {{collision}} and the ship struck again, buckling the plates of the forward bilge and ripping open the bulkheads. Shortly, the forward compartments and the engine rooms were flooded, and over 100 soldiers were drowned in their berths.|$|E
5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem {{is even more}} pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra space between {{the top of the}} cargo and the top of the hold. Cargo is then free to move {{from one side of the}} ship to the other <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> rolls. This can cause the ship to list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulker very quickly.|$|E
5|$|Commander David W. Bagley, the destroyer's commander, {{ordered all}} life rafts and boats launched. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> sank, her bow {{raised in the}} air almost {{vertically}} before she began to slip beneath the waves. At this point the armed depth charges began to explode, killing a number of {{men who had been}} unable to escape the destroyer, and stunning many others in the water. The destroyer, the first United States destroyer ever lost to enemy action, sank eight minutes after the torpedo struck the rudder, taking with her two officers and 64 men.|$|E

5|$|Eskimo (also {{known as}} Mala the Magnificent and Eskimo Wife-Traders) is a 1933 American Pre-Code drama film {{directed}} by W. S. Van Dyke and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). It {{is based on}} the books Der Eskimo and Die Flucht ins weisse Land by Danish explorer and author Peter Freuchen. The film stars Ray Mala as Mala, Lulu Wong Wing as Mala's first wife Aba, Lotus Long as Mala's second wife Iva, Peter Freuchen <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ship</b> Captain, W. S. Van Dyke as Inspector White, and Joseph Sauers as Sergeant Hunt.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{now hold}} {{that there was}} likely no {{cross-pollination}} between the Revolt of the Lash and these subsequent revolts. The formerly mutinous Minas Geraes, {{under the command of}} João Cândido after the officers abandoned the ship, used a hidden-away gun (<b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> had otherwise been disarmed after the Revolt of the Lash) to fire on the marine infantry and demonstrate their loyalty. Even so, the government and navy, fueled by anger over their lost honor, used this opportunity to round up the remaining amnestied sailors and put them in prison.|$|E
5|$|In 2273, a Starfleet {{monitoring}} station, Epsilon Nine, detects {{an alien}} force, {{hidden in a}} massive cloud of energy, moving through space towards Earth. The cloud destroys three of the Klingon Empire's new K't'inga-class warships and the monitoring station en route. On Earth, the starship Enterprise is undergoing a major refit; her former commanding officer, James T. Kirk, has been promoted to Admiral and works in San Francisco as Chief of Starfleet Operations. Starfleet dispatches Enterprise to investigate the cloud entity <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> {{is the only one}} in intercept range, requiring her new systems to be tested in transit.|$|E

He also admitted to hardly feeling the cold, most likely thanks to alcohol.|$|E
5|$|On October2, a {{tropical}} wave spawned {{a tropical}} depression about 815mi (1310km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. The depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Gail, {{and the next}} day, a ship encountered the storm, reporting a minimum pressure of 986mbar (29.12inHg). <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> crossed through the center, it reported winds of 80mph (130km/h), indicating Gail attained hurricane status. Initially believed to have dissipated and reformed as a new unnamed storm on October 5, in reality Gail continued northwest and then meandered around the central Atlantic before being absorbed by a front on October 12.|$|E
5|$|Pliny's uncle Pliny the Elder was {{in command}} of the Roman fleet at Misenum, and had {{meanwhile}} decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Tascius) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue. Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his light ship to the rescue of Rectina's party.|$|E

500|$|At her commissioning, Scharnhorst was {{commanded}} by Kapitän zur See (KzS) Otto Ciliax. [...] His tenure <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> commander was brief; in September 1939, an illness {{forced him to}} go on sick leave, and he was replaced by KzS Kurt-Caesar Hoffmann. Hoffmann served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> captain until 1942. On 1 April 1942, Hoffmann, who had been promoted to Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) and awarded the Knight's Cross, transferred command of <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> to KzS Friedrich Hüffmeier. In October 1943, shortly before Scharnhorsts last mission, Hüffmeier was replaced by KzS Fritz Hintze, who was killed during <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> final battle.|$|R

5|$|The United States Navy's {{greatest}} defeat until World War II caused {{panic in}} Washington. As Lincoln's Cabinet met {{to discuss the}} disaster, the frightened Secretary of War Edwin Stanton told the others that the Virginia might attack East coast cities, and even shell the White House before the meeting ended. Welles assured his colleagues that they were safe <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> could not traverse the Potomac River. He added that the Union also had an ironclad, {{and that it was}} heading to meet the Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The ship is {{launched}} {{towards a}} new {{solar system and}} Alien 8 performs his task {{for thousands of years}} during the journey. However, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> nears its destination, it is attacked and boarded by hostile aliens.

5|$|Yamashiro {{increased}} {{speed to}} 15 knots {{in an attempt}} to escape the trap, but she had already been hit by two to four torpedoes, and after two more torpedo hits near the starboard engine room, she was listing 45degrees to port. Shinoda gave the command to abandon ship, but neither he nor Nishimura made any attempt to leave the conning tower <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> capsized within five minutes and quickly sank, stern first, vanishing from radar between 04:19 and 04:21.
