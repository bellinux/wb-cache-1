40|$|Abstract Forty leukemic {{patients}} with inflammatory anorectal complications were examined. Twenty-two {{were affected by}} acute lymphatic leukemia, 10 by chronic lymphatic leukemia, 6 by acute myelocytic leukemia and 2 by non H lymphoma and chronic myelocytic leukemia, respectively. In all cases surgery was indicated not only to treat the anorectal complication, but mainly to resume the <b>antiblastic</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> discontinued {{because of the risk}} of sepsis and to prevent the failure of bone marrow transplantation in {{patients with}} chronic myelocytic leukemia. The underlying malignant disease and the altered platelet, white blood cell and neutrophil levels were shown to be the major factors conditioning the surgical treatment. In 2 cases, acute recurrence of the underlying disease {{and the development of a}} graft versus host disease have been the cause of death. It is concluded that in patients eligible for bone marrow transplantation or undergoing radio and/or chemotherapy, local and general antiinfective prophylaxis is of paramount importance to decrease the risk of inflammatory anorectal complications...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the huge}} {{investment}} into {{research and the}} significant effort and advances made {{in the search for}} new anticancer drugs in recent decades, cancer cure and treatment continue to be a formidable challenge. Many sources, including plants, animals, and minerals, have been explored in the oncological field because of the possibility of identifying novel molecular therapeutics. Marine sponges are a prolific source of secondary metabolites, a number of which showed intriguing tumor chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic properties. Recently, Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs derived from marine sponges have been shown to reduce metastatic breast cancer, malignant lymphoma, and Hodgkin’s disease. The chemopreventive and potential anticancer activity of marine sponge-derived compounds could be explained by multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms, including DNA protection, cell-cycle modulation, apoptosis, and anti-inflammatory activities as well as their ability to chemosensitize cancer cells to traditional <b>antiblastic</b> <b>chemotherapy.</b> The present article aims to depict the multiple mechanisms involved in the chemopreventive and therapeutic effects of marine sponges and critically explore the limitations and challenges associated with the development of marine sponge-based anticancer strategy...|$|E
40|$|Background: Angiogenesis inhibitors {{have become}} an {{important}} therapeutic approach {{in the treatment of}} hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. The achievement of Sorafenib in prolonging overall survival of patients with HCC makes therapeutic inhibition of angiogenesis a fundamental element of the treatment of HCC. Considering the heterogeneous aspects of HCC and to enhance therapeutic efficacy, overcome drug resistance and reduce toxicity, the combination of antiangiogenic drugs with <b>antiblastic</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> (AC), radiotherapy or other targeted drugs have been evaluated. The issue is further complicated by the combination of antiangiogenesis with other AC or biologic drugs. To date, there is no planned approach to determine which patients are more responsive to a given type of antiangiogenic treatment. Conclusion: Large investments in the clinical research are essential to improve treatment response and minimize toxicities for patients with HCC. Future investigations will need to focus on utilizing patterns of genetic information to classify HCC into groups that display similar prognosis and treatment sensitivity, and combining targeted therapies with AC producing enhanced anti-tumor effect. In this review the current panel of available antiangiogenic therapies for the treatment of HCC have been analyzed. In addition current clinical trials are also reported herein...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years {{evidence}} has emerged to indicate the involvement of herpes viruses in several infectious complications observed in patients undergoing <b>antiblastic</b> <b>chemotherapy.</b> We present a case of bilateral parotiditis due to EBV reactivation in a patient who had received chemotherapy because of an invasive thymoma. In October 2006, a 53 -year-old man with pulmonary and pleural metastases owing to an invasive thymoma, was started on chemotherapy with cisplatin, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide. In January 2007, after consultation with an infectious disease specialist, the patient was admitted to the oncology department because of bilateral swelling of the parotid glands which was most likely of infectious or mycotic origin and attributed to immunosuppression by chemotherapy (the last cycle was completed on 28 th December 2006). During his hospital stay, the patient underwent routine blood tests, serological tests (EBV-VCA IgM/IgG: positive/positive, EBV-EBNA IgG: positive), cultural and instrumental tests. Due to the serological results, we decided to search for EBV in blood by using PCR (23, 000 copies/ 100, 000 cells). We hypothesize that EBV infection could have caused both thymoma and bilateral parotiditis. Accordingly, a multidisciplinary approach, including consultation with an oncologist, infectious disease and microbiology specialists, {{is the best way to}} manage infectious complications in patients with a deficit of cells-mediated immunity...|$|E
40|$|At {{least one}} in a {{thousand}} pregnancies is complicated by cancer and, as the maternal age at pregnancy increases, numbers are growing. If chemotherapy cannot be postponed, both doctors and patients face complex medical and ethical issues. There is a conflict between optimal maternal therapy and fetal wellbeing. Treatment during the first trimester {{increases the risk of}} congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions and fetal death. Second and third trimester exposure is less risky, but it can cause intrauterine growth retardation and low birth weight. Other effects on pregnancy after the first trimester include premature birth, stillbirth, impaired functional development, myocardial toxicity and myelosuppression. Counseling and management of these cases are difficult, because literature is mostly represented by case reports or retrospective series while randomized prospective studies or guidelines are lacking. Moreover, personal experience is often scanty due to the rarity of the condition. This article reviews the available data regarding the different aspects of systemic treatment of cancer during pregnancy to help oncologist and obstetricians in counseling their patients and treat them accordingly. Management of pregnant women with cancer using <b>antiblastic</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> (AC) poses unusual medical and ethical challenges. There is frequently a conflict of interest between the mothers and the child, as the most appropriat...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) into clinical practice has 27 dramatically changed the natural approach of HIV-related cancers. Several {{studies have shown}} that 28 intensive <b>antiblastic</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> (AC) is feasible in HIV-infected patients with cancer, and that the 29 outcome {{is similar to that of}} HIV-negative patients receiving the same AC regimens. However, the 30 concomitant use of HAART and AC can result in drug accumulation or possible toxicity with 31 consequent decreased efficacy of one or both classes of drugs. In fact, many AC agents are 32 preferentially metabolized by CYP 450 and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with HAART are common. 33 Therefore, it is important that HIV patients with cancer in HAART receiving AC treatment at the 34 same time receive an individualized cancer management plan based on their liver and renal 35 functions, their level of bone marrow suppression, their mitochondrial dysfunction and their 36 genotype profile. The rationale of this review is to summarize the existing data on the impact of 37 HAART on the clinical management of cancer patients with HIV/AIDS and DDIs between 38 antiretrovirals and AC. In addition, in order to maximize the efficacy of antiblastic therapy and 39 minimize the risk of drug-drug interaction, a useful list of pharmacogenomic markers is provided...|$|E
40|$|Background: Recent {{data suggest}} that {{circulating}} endothelial and progenitor cells (CECs and CEPs, respectively) may have predictive potential in cancer patients treated with bevacizumab, the antibody recognizing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Here we report on CECs and CEPs investigated in 68 patients affected by recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan and two Independent Datasets of rGBM patients respectively treated with bevacizumab alone (n= 32, independent dataset A: IDA) and classical <b>antiblastic</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> (n= 14, independent dataset B: IDB). Methods: rGBM patients with KPS ≥ 50 were treated until progression, as defined by MRI with RANO criteria. CECs expressing CD 109, a marker of tumor endothelial cells, {{as well as other}} CEC and CEP subtypes, were investigated by six-color flow cytometry. Results: A baseline count of CD 109 + CEC higher than 41. 1 /ml (1 st quartile) was associated with increased progression free survival (PFS; 20 versus 9 weeks, P= 0. 008) and overall survival (OS; 32 versus 23 weeks, P= 0. 03). Longer PFS (25 versus 8 weeks, P= 0. 02) and OS (27 versus 17 weeks, P= 0. 03) were also confirmed in IDA with CD 109 + CECs higher than 41. 1 /ml but not in IDB. Patients treated with bevacizumab with or without irinotecan that were free from MRI progression after two months of treatment had significant decrease of CD 109 + CECs: media...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Pulmonary mycetoma is a {{characteristic}} clinical-radiological lesion due to colonization of aspergillus or candida species in pre-existing pulmonary cavities following {{a number of}} diseases. METHODS: We revisited 27 records of such admitted patients (19 M, 8 F; range age 16 - 27 yrs) analysing diagnostic approach and therapy. Predisposing conditions were sequelae of tuberculosis or lung abscess, bronchiectasis, bullous emphysema, leukaemia/ lymphoma, diabetes mellitus, corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant administration and <b>antiblastic</b> <b>chemotherapy.</b> All patients had {{a characteristic}} chest X-ray and the most common symptoms were cough and haemoptysis. Diagnosis of pulmonary mycetoma was based on positive sputum culture for aspergillus or candida species and/or positive result for aspergillus precipitin test. Eleven patients received only medical treatment, eight pts only a surgical one and eight patients both medical and surgical ones. Antifungal drugs administered were itraconazole or amphotericin B or fluconazole. RESULTS: In the follow-up, six out of eleven patients who had received only medical treatment, cannot be found; five patients or their relatives were interviewed by phone: two of them enjoyed good health and three had died. Sixteen patients underwent thoracic surgery {{and one of them}} died because of postsurgical complications. In the follow-up, only nine patients out of this last group were interviewed by phone 2 to 8 years after surgery: seven of them enjoyed good health while two patients had died because of disease not related to pulmonary mycetoma. CONCLUSIONS: Aspergilloma treatment is related to the extension of disease and clinical conditions of patients but surgical resection associated with drug administration, when possible, is the treatment of choice...|$|E

40|$|Metal-based {{antitumor}} drugs play {{a relevant}} role in <b>antiblastic</b> <b>chemotherapy.</b> Cisplatin {{is regarded as}} one of the most effective drugs, even if severe toxicities and drug resistance phenomena limit its clinical use. Therefore, in recent years there has been a rapid expansion in research and development of novel metal-based anticancer drugs to improve clinical effectiveness, to reduce general toxicity and to broaden the spectrum of activity. The variety of metal ion functions in biology has stimulated the development of new metallodrugs other than Pt drugs with the aim to obtain compounds acting via alternative mechanisms of action. Among non-Pt compounds, copper complexes are potentially attractive as anticancer agents. Actually, since many years a lot of researchers have actively investigated copper compounds based on the assumption proposal that endogenous metals may be less toxic. It has been established that the properties of copper-coordinated compounds are largely determined by the nature of ligands and donor atoms bound to the metal ion. In this review, the most remarkable achievements in the design and development of copper(I, II) complexes as antitumor agents are discussed. Special emphasis has been focused on the identification of structure-activity relationships for the different classes of copper(I, II) complexes. This work was motivated by the observation that no comprehensive surveys of copper complexes as anticancer agents were available in the literature. Moreover, up to now, despite the enormous efforts in synthesizing different classes of copper complexes, very few data concerning the molecular basis of the mechanisms underlying their antitumor activity are available. This overview, collecting the most significant strategies adopted in the last ten years to design promising anticancer copper(I, II) compounds, would be a help to the researchers working in this field...|$|E
