25|$|However, when Madoka {{appeared}} to retrieve Homura, {{she had forgotten}} about her duty as the Law of Cycles and her powers, thus Kyubey kept observing her until that point. Having recovered her memories, Homura forces herself to complete the witch transformation {{at the cost of}} having her soul destroyed, to protect Madoka from the Incubators. At that moment Sayaka and a new girl named Nagisa Momoe, whose witch form is actually Charlotte—the witch that killed Mami—lead Madoka and the others in breaking the barrier to reach Homura's real body. Madoka recovers her memories and power as the Law of Cycles <b>and</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> Homura, but the latter releases the curse in her Soul Gem which she reveals is not one of despair, but love. With this power, retaining her human form, Homura suppresses Madoka's powers while transcending into what she considers to be a demon.|$|E
2500|$|The Watcher in the Water {{appears in}} both film adaptations of The Lord of the Rings: Ralph Bakshi's {{animated}} The Lord of the Rings (1978) and Peter Jackson's [...] (2001). Bakshi's work follows the book faithfully for this sequence, {{with only the}} Watcher's tentacles seen. After Sam frees Frodo from its clutches, Boromir hacks at its tentacles. [...] In Jackson's adaptation, the Watcher is portrayed as a colossal, octopus-like monster with a gaping mouth and rows of sharp teeth. Here, too, it grabs Frodo with its tentacles {{as described in the}} book, <b>and</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the Fellowship following Frodo's rescue. Peter Jackson revealed in the commentaries that the original idea was to have Bill the Pony dragged under water by the Watcher; but this was changed. [...] In the DVD commentaries and production diaries, Jackson and his team explain that in their conception, the [...] "Nameless Things" [...] which gnaw tunnels beneath Moria (mentioned in the book by Gandalf) are more creatures like the Watcher. Originally, they planned to have an even longer version of the flashback in which Gandalf recounts his fight with the Balrog in Moria; this flashback would reveal that the underground lake {{at the bottom of the}} abyss cushioned the fall of Gandalf and the Balrog, who then (as in the book) continue to fight. [...] In the process, this would scare away multiple Watchers/Nameless Things. The entire sequence was ultimately cut for time and budgetary constraints, though concept art still exists on the DVD. [...] Moreover, in the concept art gallery feature on the DVD, John Howe and Alan Lee explain that the Watcher was one of the most difficult creatures to design, because it lacked virtually any description.|$|E

60|$|So {{the mother}} gets her cup of tea--and puts {{a piece of}} lemon in--and then milk on top of that. The rabbit boy sucks an orange, slobbers in the tea, insists on coffee and milk, tries a piece of lemon, and gets a biscuit. The baby, with weird faces, chews pieces of lemon: and drops them in the family cup: and fishes them out with a little sugar, and dribbles them {{across the table to}} her mouth, throws them away <b>and</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> a new sour piece. They all think it humorous and adorable. Arrives the milk, to be treated as another loving cup, mingled with orange, lemon, sugar, tea, biscuit, chocolate, and cake. Father, mother, and elder brother partake of nothing, they haven't the stomach. But they are charmed, of course, by the pretty pranks and messes of the infants. They have {{extraordinary}} amiable patience, and find the young ones a perpetual source of charming amusement. They look at one another, the elder ones, and laugh and comment, while the two young ones mix themselves and the table into a lemon-milk-orange-tea-sugar-biscuit-cake-chocolate mess. This inordinate Italian amiable patience with their young monkeys is astonishing. It makes the monkeys more monkey-like, and self-conscious incredibly, so that a baby has all the tricks of a Babylonian harlot, making eyes and trying new pranks. Till at last one sees the southern Holy Family as an unholy triad of imbecility.|$|E
