25|$|Pendulums {{are used}} in science {{education}} to demonstrate the law of conservation of energy. A heavy object such as a bowling ball or wrecking ball {{is attached to a}} string. The weight is then moved to within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> a volunteer's face, then released and allowed to swing and come back. In most instances, the weight reverses direction slightly before the position it was released from, and the volunteer is unharmed. On occasion, the volunteer does not stand still and is injured.|$|E

Winters are mild, with rainfall and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> snow about once a year. The old and new neighborhoods are contiguous, and lie on a northwest–southeast axis along the ridge of a hill, with a gradual plain descending to its south and dramatic gullies dropping to its north.

25|$|The {{repeated}} wave {{of attacks}} {{carried out by}} the Italians would render irrelevant the air-raid alarm system since it would no longer be clear if the sirens were announcing the beginning or the end of an attack. Furthermore, they used delayed-fuse bombs designed to pass through the roof and then explode inside the building and a new type of bomb which exploded with a strong lateral force, so as to destroy things and persons within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> the ground. The bombings affected all the city and the bombers didn't attempt to destroy military targets. On the night of 18 the working class districts were badly hit. The Italian bombers dropped 44 tons of bombs, and there were more than 1,000 civilians dead (Beevor: 1,000 dead and 2,000 wounded; Preston: around 1,000 dead; and Thomas: 1,300 dead and 2,000 wounded).|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{father had}} an {{extremely}} low tolerance for noise, {{to the point}} of refusing to have a working television or radio in the house. He almost never allowed his wife or son to speak and viciously beat them if they did so without permission, particularly forbidding them to speak to or around Genie. Any conversation between them was therefore very quiet and out of Genie's earshot, preventing her from hearing any meaningful amount of language. Her father kept Genie's room extremely dark, and the only available stimuli were the crib, the chair, curtains on each of the windows, three pieces of furniture, and two plastic rain jackets hanging on the wall. On rare occasions her father allowed her to play with plastic food containers, old spools of thread, TV Guides with many of the illustrations cut out, and the raincoats. The room had two almost entirely blacked-out windows, one which her father left slightly open; although the house was well away from the street and other houses, she could see the side of a neighboring house and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> sky, and occasionally heard environmental sounds or a neighboring child practicing the piano.|$|E
25|$|However, {{early on}} February 16, heavy snow started falling {{in those two}} cities, and the snow later {{developed}} in Philadelphia. Heavy snow was continuously reported, falling at rates of up to 4inches (10cm) per hour. In addition, temperatures were frigid, around 15°F (-10°C). The heavy snow continued all day, and it developed in New York City by the evening. At about the same time, the snow changed to sleet in Washington, D.C., and significantly lowered the accumulation. Throughout {{the rest of the}} Northeast, however, the snow continued for much of the night. The sleet changed back to snow by the next morning in Washington, D.C., and soon ended. By that time, a secondary low pressure system formed off the North Carolina coast and traveled north, turning the storm into a nor'easter for New York City and Boston. Blizzard Warnings were issued, and the snow began in Boston that day. In the evening, the heavy snow ended in New York City, and ended in Boston the morning of February 18. After that, the storm weakened and brought <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> snow to other parts of New England. The blizzard left the East Coast of the United States on February 19 and moved out into the North Atlantic Ocean. The storm weakened until it was completely absorbed by other systems on February 22.|$|E

500|$|Dorian's {{lifeboat}} was {{the smallest}} of the ship's boats and, with 26 crew and 5 passengers on board, had only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> freeboard. [...] In worsening weather, Dorian improvised a rough sea anchor, which enabled the boat to ride the waves through the night and following day without being swamped. [...] In the late afternoon of September 28 they sighted a distant sail, which proved to be the Canadian bark Huron, bound for Quebec. [...] As they rowed towards their rescuer, they passed Peter McCabe, still clinging to the makeshift raft, the only one of its 72 occupants to have survived the night; he, too was taken on board Huron. [...] McCabe later recalled that he thought he was within ten minutes of death when he was rescued.|$|E
500|$|In Traveling Shoes, Angelou {{has matured}} {{as a writer}} {{to the point that}} she can {{experiment}} with form. [...] For the first time, instead of using traditional numbered chapters, the book consists of anecdotes separated with <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> white space. [...] Lupton calls these segments [...] "short stories or vignettes", a technique that Angelou had used before, to portray dynamic characters such as Malcolm X. [...] Angelou's stories are told within the context of her entire life story, but each vignette can be read or analyzed individually, without harming the text's consistency. [...] Most of Angelou's anecdotes no longer focus on the famous or her family, but on Ghanaians; for example, according to Lupton, her description of her houseboy Kojo is her most delightful character sketch in the book.|$|E
500|$|The Coldrum Stones {{have been}} {{excavated}} on multiple occasions. On 16 April 1910, the amateur archaeologist F. J. Bennett began excavation at the site, after previously having uncovered some Neolithic lithics from Addington Long Barrow. He soon discovered human bones [...] "under only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> chalky soil". He {{returned to the}} site for further excavation in August 1910, this time with his niece and her husband, {{both of whom were}} dentists with an interest in craniology; on that day they discovered pieces of a human skull, which they were able to largely reconstruct. A few days later he returned to excavate on the north-west corner of the chamber with the architect E. W. Filkins; that day, they found a second skull, further bones, a flint tool, and pieces of pottery. This pottery was later identified as being Anglo-Saxon in date.|$|E

Elsewhere in Indian River County, rainfall amounts were generally between [...] Throughout Indian River County, 27homes and 2singlefamily homes were flooded, while 20roads were temporarily closed due to standing water. An EF0 tornado touched down in Vero Beach for about two minutes, damaging 118mobile homes and 15single family houses. According to Indian River County Emergency Management Coordinator Dale Justice, that tornado caused $850,000 in losses. At the Vero Beach Municipal Airport, sustained winds reached [...] In Highlands County, up to [...] of rain forced the closure of a small portion of U.S. Route 98 between Cowhouse Road and County Road 621 in Lorida.

500|$|In central Greenland {{a typical}} year might produce {{two or three}} feet of winter snow, plus <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> summer snow. [...] When this turns to ice, the two layers will make up {{no more than a}} foot of ice. [...] The layers {{corresponding}} to the summer snow will contain bigger bubbles than the winter layers, so the alternating layers remain visible, which makes it possible to count down a core and determine the age of each layer. [...] As the depth increases {{to the point where the}} ice structure changes to a clathrate, the bubbles are no longer visible, and the layers can no longer be seen. [...] Dust layers may now become visible. [...] Ice from Greenland cores contains dust carried by wind; the dust appears most strongly in late winter, and appears as cloudy grey layers. [...] These layers are stronger and easier to see at times in the past when the earth's climate was cold, dry, and windy.|$|E

2500|$|Digging up the {{rhizomes}} is {{a common}} solution where the land is to be developed, as this is quicker than the use of herbicides, but safe disposal of the plant material without spreading it is difficult; knotweed is classed as controlled waste in the UK, and disposal is regulated by law. Digging up the roots is also very labour-intensive and not always efficient.
