40|$|Aims High-yielding maize-based crop systems require maize {{to take up}} large {{quantities}} of nitrogen over short periods of time. Nitrogen management in conventional crop systems assumes that soil N mineralization alone cannot meet rapid rates of crop N uptake, and thus large pools of inorganic N, typically supplied as fertilizer, are required to meet crop N demand. Net soil N mineralization data support this assumption; net N mineralization rates are typically lower than maize N uptake rates. However, net N mineralization does not fully capture the flux of N from organic to inorganic forms. Gross <b>ammonification</b> may better represent the absolute flux of inorganic N produced by soil N mineralization. Methods Here we utilize a long-term cropping systems experiment in Iowa, USA to compare the peak rate of N accumulation in maize biomass to the rate of inorganic N production through gross <b>ammonification</b> of soil organic N. Results Peak maize N uptake rates averaged 4. 4 kg N ha− 1 d− 1, while gross <b>ammonification</b> rates over the 0 – 80 cm depth averaged 23 kg N ha− 1 d− 1. Gross <b>ammonification</b> was highly stratified, with 63 % occurring in the 0 – 20 cm depth and 37 % in the 20 – 80 cm depth. Neither peak maize N uptake rate nor gross <b>ammonification</b> rate differed significantly among three cropping systems with varied rotation lengths and fertilizer inputs. Conclusions Gross <b>ammonification</b> rate was 3. 4 to 4. 5 times greater than peak maize N uptake across the cropping systems, indicating that inorganic N mineralized from soil organic matter {{may be able to}} satisfy a large portion of crop N demand, and that explicit consideration of gross N mineralization may contribute to development of strategies that reduce crop reliance on large soil inorganic N pools that are easily lost to the environment...|$|E

Growth yield determinations with pure cultures of Paracoccus denitrificans and Pseudomonas stutzeri revealed that far less energy is converted via ATP into cell mass than expected from the above calculations.

40|$|Background Eelgrass (Zostera marina) is {{a marine}} {{angiosperm}} and foundation species that {{plays an important}} ecological role in primary production, food web support, and elemental cycling in coastal ecosystems. As with other plants, the microbial communities living in, on, and near eelgrass {{are thought to be}} intimately connected to the ecology and biology of eelgrass. Here we characterized the microbial communities in eelgrass sediments throughout an experiment to quantify the rate of <b>ammonification,</b> the first step in early remineralization of organic matter, also known as diagenesis, from plots at a field site in Bodega Bay, CA. Methods Sediment was collected from 72 plots from a 15 month long field experiment in which eelgrass genotypic richness and relatedness were manipulated. In the laboratory, we placed sediment samples (n =  4 per plot) under a N 2 atmosphere, incubated them at in situ temperatures (15  °C) and sampled them initially and after 4, 7, 13, and 19 days to determine the <b>ammonification</b> rate. Comparative microbiome analysis using high throughput sequencing of 16 S rRNA genes was performed on sediment samples taken initially and at seven, 13 and 19 days to characterize changes in the relative abundances of microbial taxa throughout <b>ammonification.</b> Results Within-sample diversity of the sediment microbial communities across all plots decreased after the initial timepoint using both richness based (observed number of OTUs, Chao 1) and richness and evenness based diversity metrics (Shannon, Inverse Simpson). Additionally, microbial community composition changed across the different timepoints. Many of the observed changes in relative abundance of taxonomic groups between timepoints appeared driven by sulfur cycling with observed decreases in predicted sulfur reducers (Desulfobacterales) and corresponding increases in predicted sulfide oxidizers (Thiotrichales). None of these changes in composition or richness were associated with variation in <b>ammonification</b> rates. Discussion Our results showed that the microbiome of sediment from different plots followed similar successional patterns, which we infer to be due to changes related to sulfur metabolism. These large changes likely overwhelmed any potential changes in sediment microbiome related to <b>ammonification</b> rate. We found no relationship between eelgrass presence or genetic composition and the microbiome. This was likely due to our sampling of bulk sediments to measure <b>ammonification</b> rates rather than sampling microbes in sediment directly in contact with the plants and suggests that eelgrass influence on the sediment microbiome may be limited in spatial extent. More in-depth functional studies associated with eelgrass microbiome will be required in order to fully understand the implications of these microbial communities in broader host-plant and ecosystem functions (e. g., elemental cycling and eelgrass-microbe interactions) ...|$|E
40|$|Nitrate {{reduction}} {{is considered to}} be a minor microbial pathway in the oxidation of mangrove-derived organic matter due to a limited supply of nitrate in mangrove soils. At a limited availability of this electron acceptor compared to the supply of degradable carbon, nitrate <b>ammonification</b> is thought to be the preferential pathway of nitrate reduction. Mangrove forest mutually differ in their productivity, which may lead to different available carbon to nitrate ratios in their soil. Hence, nitrate <b>ammonification</b> is expected to be of more importance in high- compared to low-productive forests. The hypothesis was tested in flow-through reactors that contain undisturbed mangrove soils from high-productive Avicennia germinans and Rhizophora mangle forests in Florida and low-productive Avicennia marina forests in Saudi Arabia. Nitrate was undetectable in the soils from both regions. It was assumed that a legacy of nitrate <b>ammonification</b> would be reflected by a higher ammonium production from these soils upon the addition of nitrate. Unexpectedly, the soils from the low-productive forests in Saudi Arabia produced considerably more ammonium than the soils from the high-productive forests in Florida. Hence, other environmental factors than productivity must govern the selection of nitrate <b>ammonification</b> or denitrification. A rather intriguing observation was the 1 : 1 production of nitrite and ammonium during the consumption of nitrate, more or less independent from sampling region, location, sampling depth, mangrove species and from the absence or presence of additional degradable carbon. This 1 : 1 ratio points to a coupled production of ammonium and nitrite by one group of nitrate-reducing microorganisms. Such a production of nitrite will be hidden by the presence of active nitrite-reducing microorganisms under the nitrate-limited conditions of most mangrove forest soils...|$|E

This study examined the possibility that increased water movement into the subsoil after the removal of native vegetation, and a subsequent increase in periods of waterlogging, could have triggered nitrate <b>ammonification</b> and {{be responsible for the}} production of ammonium. Two incubation experiments were conducted to test this hypothesis. The first involved the incubation of repacked cores that had been amended with 30 mg N/kg of 5 atom% N- 15 nitrate under low oxygen conditions for a period of 360 days. Over this time period the N- 15 enrichment of the exchangeable ammonium fraction was monitored in order to detect any reduction of nitrate to ammonium. The second experiment involved the incubation of soil amended with 30 mg N/ kg of 5 atom% N- 15 nitrate under waterlogged and low oxygen conditions for 75 days. During this period the redox potential of the soil was monitored using a field test to determine if reducing conditions would develop in this soil over a period of waterlogging, combined with the monitoring of any nitrate reduction to ammonium. The results of these experiments indicated that a small amount of nitrate <b>ammonification</b> (< 0. 1 mg N/ kg) could be observed in the Warra subsoil, but that unless the rate of reduction were to significantly increase with time, this could not account for the accumulation of ammonium observed in the field. The environmental conditions that would make either dissimilatory or abiotic nitrate <b>ammonification</b> favourable were not observed to develop.

They also produce an increase in <b>ammonification,</b> nitrification, and in nitrogen fixation when these processes are tested by the beaker method. These increases are in all cases almost proportionate to the amount of lime applied. 2. Natural increases in numbers of bacteria tend to obscure the effects of applications of lime, while natural decreases make them more pronounced. 3. Peptone solutions do not permit of the determining of the largest number of bacteria which will destroy humus with the production of ammonia. 4. The beaker method, with dried blood or cottonseed meal for <b>ammonification,</b> with ammonium sulfate or dried blood for nitrification, and with mannite for nitrogen fixation, is eminently satisfactory. 5. The <b>ammonification</b> of dried blood or of cottonseed meal runs parallel with the numbers of bacteria while there is very little relation between the <b>ammonification</b> of peptone solutions and numbers. 6. Increased nitrification leads to slight accumulations of nitrates in the soil. 7. Natural accumulations of nitrates in the soil tend to obscure the differences due to the lime treatment. 8. The solution method for nitrogen fixation is quite unreliable. 9.
