The conversation led to talk of Fleury playing a game for the Vipers as a publicity stunt. He made his professional baseball debut on August 9, 2008, at the age of 40, hitting a single in a pinch-hit appearance against the Yuma Scorpions. He started the second game at left field and struck out twice before he was replaced. [...] "I've had so many things happen in my life already that I sometimes surprise myself with the things I've done, the things I've accomplished.

Critically it was poorly received, and was later declared by Harvard as the worst film of all time. One critic attacked O'Hara with saying [...] "just <b>another</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> precious Hollywood juvenile products who in workday life would benefit from a good hiding", while Bosley Crowther dismissed the film was a [...] "compound of hackneyed situations, maudlin dialogue and preposterously bad acting". In Gregory Ratoff's musical Do You Love Me, O'Hara portrayed a prim, bespectacled music school dean who transforms herself into a desirable, sophisticated lady in the big city. She commented that it was [...] "one of the worst pictures I ever made". It frustrated her that she could not put her talents to good use, to not even sing in it.|$|E

500|$|... "Sparks Fly" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised Swift's vocals on [...] "Sparks Fly", commenting that her voice {{in such an}} upbeat song is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer. Rahul Prabhakar of The Oxonian Review considers it [...] "dopamine-infused, hair-whipping stuff". Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine calls the song [...] "the purest iteration of Swift’s template and repertoire", also saying that it [...] "could turn things around for Swift, as it’s perhaps the most perfectly constructed single in a career built on tracks that are marvels of pop production and songwriting." [...] He concluded by stating that the song [...] "proves how evocative those turns-of-phrase {{can be in the}} right context. To that end, “Sparks Fly” plays as a template as much as it does as a standalone single, and it’s a testament to everything Taylor Swift gets right." [...] Bobby Peacock of Roughstock claims that he gets [...] "a sense that Taylor is starting to experience a little [...] burnout at radio. Her songs drop like rocks once they peak, and she's currently 0 for 3 on hitting the top of the Billboard charts. While I don't think this song has that je ne sais quoi to get her another 'You Belong with Me'-level [...] hit, I still think that even a slightly lesser effort from her is a worthwhile listen." [...] Blake Boldt of Engine 145 praised Swift, saying [...] "Her infusion of individual lines with urgency (“Drop everything now,” she insists) and earnestness (“Take away the pain,” she pleads) are a tribute to her talent, {{not so much as a}} distinguished vocalist but as an excellent communicator. Each frazzled note is freighted with meaning. Should I stay or should I go now?, she wonders, [...] away the hours before he calls her again." [...] Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country claimed the song is [...] "just <b>another</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> so-Swift tracks that continually toes the line between country and pop to create a genre that is 100% Taylor Swift." [...] Erin Thompson of Seattle Weekly stated he wasn't to [...] "hot on" [...] the song and compared the song to Swift's earlier works, [...] "Fearless", [...] "Hey Stephen", and [...] "Forever and Always", and stated that Swift [...] "puts in a line about standing in the rain in so many of her songs that I'm beginning to think she watches The Notebook every time she gets ready to sit down and write a song." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin considered it a bubbly tune along with Swift's song, [...] "Long Live".|$|E
2500|$|Variety {{called it}} [...] "a distended, talky, {{redundant}} and moody melodrama" [...] and added, [...] "The overemphasis on Streisand makes the film just <b>another</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> Streisand vehicles where no other elements {{ever get a}} chance." [...] Time Out London observed, [...] "ith the script glossing whole areas of confrontation (from the Communist '30s to the McCarthy witch-hunts), it often passes into the haze of a nostalgic fashion parade. Although Streisand's liberated Jewish lady is implausible, and emphasizes the period setting as just so much dressing, Redford's Fitzgerald-type character [...] [...] [...] is an intriguing trailer for his later Great Gatsby. It's a performance that brings more weight to the film than it deserves, often hinting at depths that are finally skated over." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{follow-up}} album Rocket Cottage (1976), {{also produced}} by Batt, {{proved to be}} a commercial flop, despite having much in common musically with its immediate predecessor.

The song failed to make the UK Chart, in complete contrast to [...] "All Around My Hat", despite having much in common with its predecessor – a 12/8 time signature, upbeat tempo, solo verses and full harmony chorus. Rocket Cottage also included experimental tracks [...] "Fighting for Strangers" [...] (with sparse vocals singing concurrently in a variety of keys) and, on the final track, excerpts of studio banter between the band members and a seemingly impromptu rendition of [...] "Camptown Races", in which Prior gets the lyrics wrong.|$|E

Meiers was from Chicago {{and was an}} avid reader of Bill Holman's strip, which was run daily in the Chicago Tribune. Smokey Stover's catch-phrase was [...] "where there's foo, there's fire". In a mission debriefing on the evening November 27, 1944, Fritz Ringwald, the unit's S-2 Intelligence Officer, stated that Meiers and Ed Schleuter had sighted a red ball of fire that appeared to chase them {{through a variety of}} high-speed maneuvers. Fritz said that Meiers was extremely agitated and had a copy of the comic strip tucked in his back pocket.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} some extensions to Mobile IP {{designed to}} better adapt this protocol to wireless networks. Specifically, the foreign-agent selection process is studied in depth and several selection criteria are proposed and implemented as extensions to an existing Mobile IP software package. Wireless computer networks bring many advantages to those environments where network connectivity is required subject to constraints such as flexibility, affordability, and scalability. Wireless Local Area Networks (LANs) {{can be quickly}} installed in cases where traditional networks are not a feasible option for reasons like deployment time, cost, etc. Mobile IP is a protocol that provides support for roaming of computers between different networks. Each Mobile IP-enabled computer (mobile node) has a fixed home agent on its original network that keeps track of the mobile node’s location at all times. The protocol specifies several different mechanisms for the mobile node to keep its home agent updated about its location every time it moves to <b>another</b> network. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> mechanisms requires the mobile node to select a temporary gateway computer (foreign agent) at the visited network; this computer {{will serve as the}} mobile node’s default router {{to the rest of the}} network and will forward location updates to the mobile node’s home agent.
