Nagavarmacharya, a Brahmin Advaita saint of Balligavi, who was patronised by King Udayatidya, a vassal of Chalukya King Someshvara II, wrote Chandrachudamani sataka (c.1070) in the sataka (hundred-line verse) metre. In this centum of verses, where each ends with the term [...] "Chandrachudamani" [...] as <b>another</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> god Shiva, the author treats on viragya (ethics of renunciation). Other writers whose works are {{considered}} lost but have been referenced in contemporary writings are Gunachandra and Gunavarma. Gunachandra, who was admired by King Someshvara II (also called Bhuvanaika Malla), wrote Parsvabhyudaya and Maghanadisvara. Gunavarma, who earned the honorific Bhuvanaika Vira, a title befitting a warrior rather than a poet, is mentioned by grammarian Keshiraja (c.1260) as the author of Harivamsa. His title identifies him with a Ganga prince called Udayaditya who was a minister and general under Chalukya King Someshvara II. Other writings ascribed to the author are Pushpadanta Purana and Devachandra Prabha Stotra.|$|E

60|$|Simple ideas, as {{has been}} shown, can only be got by {{experience}} from those objects which are proper to produce in us those perceptions. When, by this means, we have our minds stored with them, and know the names for them, then {{we are in a}} condition to define, and by definition to understand, the names of complex ideas that are made up of them. But when any term stands for a simple idea that a man has never yet had in his mind, it is impossible by any words to make known its meaning to him. When any term stands for an idea a man is acquainted with, but is ignorant that that term is the sign of it, then <b>another</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same idea, which he has been accustomed to, may make him understand its meaning.

6000|$|... 7. Morning. But {{what shall}} we do about this letter of MD's, N.19? Not a word {{answered}} yet, and so much paper spent! I cannot do anything in it, sweethearts, till night.--At night. O Lord, O Lord! the greatest disgrace that ever was has happened to Presto. What do you think? but, when I was going out this forenoon a letter came from MD, N.20, dated Dublin. O dear, O dear! O sad, O sad!--Now I have two letters together to answer: here they are, lying together. But I will only answer the first; for I came in late. I dined with my friend Lewis at his lodgings, and walked at six to Kensington to Mrs. Masham's son's christening. It was very private; nobody there but my Lord Treasurer, his son and son-in-law, that is to say, Lord Harley and Lord Dupplin, and Lord Rivers and I. The Dean of Rochester(14) christened the child, but soon went away. Lord Treasurer and Lord Rivers were godfathers; and Mrs. Hill,(15) Mrs. Masham's sister, godmother. The child roared like a bull, and I gave Mrs. Masham joy of it; and she charged me {{to take care of}} my nephew, because, Mr. Masham being a brother of our Society, his son, you know, is consequently a nephew. Mrs. Masham sat up dressed in bed, but not, as they do in Ireland, with all smooth about her, as if she was cut off in the middle; for you might see the counterpane (what d'ye call it?) rise about her hips and body. There is <b>another</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> counterpane; and you will laugh now, sirrahs. George Granville came in at supper, and we stayed till eleven; and Lord Treasurer set me down at my lodging in Suffolk Street. Did I ever tell you that Lord Treasurer hears ill with the left ear, just as I do? He always turns the right, and his servants whisper him at that only. I dare not tell him that I am so too, for fear he should think I counterfeited, to make my court.|$|E
