5|$|The {{modified}} castle {{was completed}} by 1808, and held eight 24-pounder (11kg) guns along the outer wall, <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> {{the roof of the}} southern bastion, and another on top of the keep itself. The new castle could hold a garrison of 40 men.|$|E
5|$|Cane becomes intoxicated. Erica {{enters his}} room, and Jake, {{who has been}} spying, sees the two kiss, but leaves before he sees Cane reject Erica. An embarrassed Erica orders Cane to kill Rose no matter what. When she returns to her saloon, Jake slaps her. Jake goes to Rose's office and tells her {{everything}} he knows. Back at the saloon, Jake draws <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> Cane, who kills him. Rose does not arrest him as Erica claims it was self-defense.|$|E
5|$|A lighter {{alternative}} to the turret, particularly popular with the French navy, was the barbette. These were fixed armored towers which held <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> a turntable. The crew was sheltered from direct fire, but vulnerable to plunging fire, for instance from shore emplacements. The barbette was lighter than the turret, needing less machinery and no roof armor—though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top-weight of their ships. The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s, and {{with the addition of}} an armored 'gun-house', transformed into the turrets of the pre-Dreadnought battleships.|$|E

5|$|As Liquid, in REX, battles Snake, Gray Fox appears, destroys REX's radome, and is killed. Snake destroys REX and defeats Liquid, then escapes with Meryl or Otacon via an {{underground}} tunnel, pursued by Liquid in a Jeep. After their vehicles crash, Liquid pulls <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> Snake but dies from FoxDie. Colonel Campbell, briefly ousted from command, calls off a nuclear strike to destroy {{evidence of the}} operation, and has Snake registered as killed in action to stop the US government searching for him. Naomi Hunter, who injected Snake with the FoxDie virus, tells him that he has an indeterminate amount of time before it kills him. Ocelot calls the U.S. President; he was a double agent whose mission was to steal Baker's disk of Metal Gear specifications.|$|E
5|$|Bond later {{scales the}} walls to the Whyte House's top floor to confront Whyte. He is instead met by two {{identical}} Blofelds, who use an electronic device to sound like Whyte. Bond kills one of the Blofelds, {{which turns out to}} be a look-alike. The real Blofeld pulls <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> Bond, and instructs him into a elevator, where he is knocked out by gas. He is picked up by Wint and Kidd, and taken out to Las Vegas Valley, where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die. The pipeline is buried the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{returned}} home when his state {{took up the}} issue of secession. His successor as governor, Isham G. Harris, and the legislature, organized a referendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession; when that failed, they put the question of leaving the Union to a popular vote. Despite threats on Johnson's life, and actual assaults, he campaigned against both questions, sometimes speaking with <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> the lectern before him. Although Johnson's eastern region of Tennessee was largely against secession, the second referendum passed, and in June 1861, Tennessee joined the Confederacy. Believing he would be killed if he stayed, Johnson fled through the Cumberland Gap, where his party was in fact shot at. He left his wife and family in Greeneville.|$|E

5|$|Ross {{continues}} to gather evidence while the hijackers capture {{a shipment of}} cigarettes worth £10,000. As the gang prepare to make one last raid – their target being a £20,000 haul of nickel ingots – Ross himself joins the operation {{with the aim of}} exposing Miles. Having uncovered the truth behind Ross's actions, Diamond pulls <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> the officer and chases him through the cellars underneath the café. Wounding Ross with one of his bullets, Diamond eventually corners him, only to be shot dead by Johnny – an undercover detective who has successfully infiltrated the gang. Johnny informs Ross that the authorities are already aware of Miles' location and that he {{and the rest of the}} gang will soon be apprehended. Ross returns to his former life as an ordinary beat constable.|$|E
5|$|Sarah advises that Hank and Jacob team up to {{plot against}} Lou. Much to Jacob's dismay, the two {{brothers}} visit Lou at his home where Jacob has him drunkenly confess to the old man's murder. Hank records the false confession with a tape recorder. Lou grows enraged when he realizes that the two have conspired against him and pulls <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> them. Jacob grabs a rifle from his truck and kills Lou to save his brother. Hank then kills Lou's wife with Lou's shotgun when she appears with another gun. The two brothers avoid arrest after Hank concocts a rehearsed speech for himself and Jacob to tell the police.|$|E
5|$|Behind Volage and Danaé, the Venetian Corona {{had engaged}} Cerberus {{in a close}} range duel, during which Cerberus took heavy damage but inflicted similar {{injuries}} on the Italian ship. This exchange continued until the arrival of Active caused the Danaé, Corona and Carolina to sheer off and retreat to the east. To the rear, Amphion succeeded in closing with and raking Flore, and caused such damage that within five minutes the French ship's officers threw the French colours overboard in surrender. Captain Péridier had been seriously wounded in the action, and took no part in Flores later movements. Amphion then attacked Bellona and in an engagement that lasted until 12:00, forced the Italian ship's surrender. During this combat, the small ship Principessa Augusta fired on Amphion from a distance, until the frigate was able to turn <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> them and drive them off. Hoste sent a punt to take possession of Bellona but due to the damage suffered was unable to launch a boat to seize Flore. Realising Amphion's difficulty, the officers of Flore, who had made hasty repairs during the conflict between Amphion and Bellona, immediately set sail for the French harbour on Lesina (Hvar), despite having already surrendered.|$|E

5|$|Filming of Big Money Rustlas, a Western spoof, {{began in}} January 2009, and {{concluded}} on February 24, 2009. The tenth Gathering of the Juggalos {{took place at}} Hogrock in Cave-In-Rock, Illinois, from August 6 to 9. The event had the largest attendance in Gathering history with over 20,000 people. Over 120 musical artists performed at the event, including the likes of Tech N9ne, Kottonmouth Kings, Ice Cube, GWAR, Coolio, Vanilla Ice, Onyx, Scarface, The Dayton Family, Bizarre, Esham, and NATAS. At the event, the Big Money Rustlas trailer was screened twice. An infomercial for the event was released online by Psychopathic Records. After the event, a friend of Esham's handed Bruce {{a copy of his}} album I Ain't Cha Homey, which depicted a clown committing suicide with <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> the front cover. Bruce listened to the album and saw it as a diss towards Insane Clown Posse. While Esham claimed that the album was not a diss in his podcast, the album strained the relationship between Bruce and Esham, and the two have not spoken since its release.|$|E
5|$|Vidya goes to meet Damji, {{followed}} by Rana and Khan. Damji cuts the meeting short when Vidya expresses her {{doubt that he}} will be able to return her husband in exchange for the sensitive file, and he attempts to leave. Vidya tries to stop him, and in the ensuing struggle Damji draws <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> her. Vidya disarms him using the prosthetic belly she has been using to fake her pregnancy and promptly stabbing him in the neck with her hair stick, before shooting him with his own gun. She flees into the crowd before the police arrive, leaving a thank you note for Rana and a pen drive containing data from Sridhar's computer, which leads to Bhaskaran's arrest. Rana concludes that no Vidya or Arnab Bagchi ever existed, and that Vidya had been using the police and the IB to achieve her own ends.|$|E

Just as Rohrer is about to crush Doggett's skull, he is decapitated by McMahon. Rohrer is presumed dead, but soon awakens and stabs McMahon. Both bodies tumble into the water. The three agents board the ship, which is abandoned, and find the captain's decapitated body. Scully gains access to the now empty lab and finds evidence of manipulation of ova. However, she is forced to leave when Doggett finds a time bomb on the bridge. The agents narrowly escape the explosion.|$|E
