5|$|If magma were to rise {{towards the}} surface of Nazko, new {{earthquake}} swarms would occur, with {{a significant increase in}} the size and number of earthquakes. <b>An</b> <b>eruption</b> in the Nazko area would probably create a small cinder cone, similar to what formed Nazko Cone 7,200years ago. Immediate hazards related to cinder cone eruptions in the Nazko area would probably be forest fires and, if <b>an</b> <b>eruption</b> column were produced, redirection of nearby air traffic.|$|E
5|$|Monte Burney {{is formed}} by a caldera with a glaciated {{stratovolcano}} on its rim. This stratovolcano in turn has a smaller caldera. <b>An</b> <b>eruption</b> is reported for 1910, with less certain eruptions in 1970 and 1920.|$|E
5|$|On January 30, 2009, {{scientists}} from the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) warned that <b>an</b> <b>eruption</b> was imminent, sending experienced Alaskans shopping for protection against a dusty shower of volcanic ash that could descend on south-central Alaska.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> Splendid <b>eruption</b> has <b>a</b> larger {{effect on}} Brilliant Pool, {{dropping}} the level lower than <b>a</b> Daisy <b>eruption.</b> On occasion, Splendid will have <b>a</b> series of <b>eruptions,</b> preventing Brilliant Pool from refilling completely {{before the next}} eruption.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> 1950 <b>eruption</b> had <b>a</b> VEI=2. There was <b>an</b> {{explosive}} <b>eruption.</b> Another eruption occurred {{two years}} later in 1952. This <b>eruption</b> had <b>a</b> VEI=0.|$|R

5|$|These were {{supplemented}} {{by a great}} deal of shore-based research. Fresh rock collected during the expedition revealed that <b>an</b> <b>eruption</b> occurred before the earthquake swarm.|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} way to detect <b>an</b> <b>eruption</b> is studying Edziza's geological history since every volcano {{has its own}} pattern of behavior, {{in terms of its}} eruption style, magnitude and frequency, so that its future eruption is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions.|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} way to detect <b>an</b> <b>eruption</b> is studying Silverthrone's geological history since every volcano {{has its own}} pattern of behavior, {{in terms of its}} eruption style, magnitude and frequency, so that its future eruption is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions. But this would likely be abandoned {{in part because of the}} volcano's remoteness.|$|E

5000|$|... 1538: <b>A</b> {{volcanic}} <b>eruption</b> {{centered on}} the cay of Ferraria, São Miguel. In that year, <b>an</b> underwater <b>eruption</b> in the proximity of Ponta da Ferraria lasted for nearly <b>a</b> month. The <b>eruption</b> resulted in {{the appearance of a}} small island of [...] "one league in circumference" [...] that shortly disappeared. The eruption caused no damage on land.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> small <b>eruption</b> {{may have}} {{occurred}} in 1810 (give or take 10 years), but this event is uncertain. The only known eruption from Victory was <b>a</b> long-term <b>eruption</b> that lasted from the late 19th century to the mid 20th century.|$|R
5|$|Eruptive {{activity}} at Mentolat has been ongoing since the Pleistocene, with the earliest explosive eruptions occurring over 17,340 years ago. <b>An</b> <b>eruption</b> {{during the late}} Glacial formed the MENo tephra. The volcanic activity has been inferred from tephra layers in lakes and outcrops.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>an</b> <b>eruption,</b> it is {{very common}} {{for the public to}} hold fears about {{chemical}} contamination of water supplies. However, in general, the physical impacts of an ashfall will tend to overwhelm problems caused by the release of chemical contaminants from fresh volcanic ash. Impacts vary according to the type of treatment system.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{given that}} the way {{airborne}} ash is deposited after <b>an</b> <b>eruption</b> is strongly influenced by the meteorological conditions, a certain variation of the ash type will occur, {{as a function of}} distance to the volcano or time elapsed from eruption. The ash from Mount St. Helens is no exception, and hence the ash properties have large variations.|$|E
50|$|The {{last major}} {{eruption}} {{associated with this}} region occurred on 31 December 1720. Beginning as <b>a</b> submarine <b>eruption,</b> it eventually built to <b>a</b> Surtseyan <b>eruption</b> {{that resulted in the}} formation of a circular island 1.5 km long, 250 m altitude island.|$|R
5|$|During {{recorded}} history, eruptions have consisted {{primarily of}} <b>a</b> central vent <b>eruption</b> (in the caldera) followed by <b>an</b> explosive <b>eruption,</b> then lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was about 6660BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245BC±150years (dated through radiocarbon dating), about 850BC, 200BC±100 years, 350AD±300 years, 675AD±50 years, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps), 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps), 1845, 1916, December 1984 – March 1985, September 1985 – July 1991, and possibly in April 1994. Many of these <b>eruptions</b> involved <b>a</b> central vent <b>eruption,</b> <b>a</b> flank vent <b>eruption,</b> and <b>a</b> phreatic (steam) explosion. Ruiz is the second-most active volcano in Colombia after Galeras.|$|R
50|$|Brisbane tuff {{is a type}} of rock, {{formed as}} a result of <b>a</b> {{volcanic}} <b>eruption.</b> <b>As</b> the name suggests, it {{is a type of}} tuff found in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.|$|R
5|$|Hazard maps {{showing that}} Armero would be {{completely}} flooded after <b>an</b> <b>eruption</b> were distributed {{more than a month}} before the eruption, but the Colombian Congress criticized the scientific and civil defense agencies for scaremongering. The eruption occurred at the height of guerrilla warfare in Bogotá, Colombia's capital, and so the government and army were occupied {{at the time of the}} eruption.|$|E
5|$|In 1819, {{smoke was}} {{observed}} at the mountain. However, this is often not recorded as <b>an</b> <b>eruption</b> as the information was insufficient to identify it as such. Similarly, in 2003, a blowing cloud of snow was mistaken by {{an employee of the}} ConocoPhillips Building in Anchorage for an ash plume. Possible steam-vapor let off was observed in 1933 at the mountain.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} the heated water to form a geyser, a {{plumbing}} system made of fractures, fissures, porous spaces, and sometimes cavities is required. This includes a reservoir to hold the water while it is being heated. Geysers are generally aligned along faults. Constrictions in the system {{are essential to the}} building up of pressure before <b>an</b> <b>eruption.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> major <b>eruption</b> {{occurred}} in 1947.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> hydrovolcanic <b>eruption</b> {{occurs when}} lava comes {{into contact with}} water. Hydrovolcanic eruptions can cause violent explosions and large waves. Radiocarbon dating has shown that many hydrovolcanic eruptions {{occurred}} in the past. It is quite possible they will occur again during <b>a</b> future <b>eruption.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{most recent}} <b>eruption,</b> <b>a</b> major VEI 4 event, {{happened}} with little warning on April 22-23, 2015, followed by <b>a</b> smaller <b>eruption</b> on April 30. This was Calbuco's first activity since 1972.|$|R
5|$|Pyroclastic {{flows from}} <b>an</b> <b>eruption</b> would destroy much {{wildlife}} about the volcano. Gareloi has historically produced several pyroclastic flows, which can travel extremely fast. Future flows at Gareloi Volcano could travel {{off the island}} into the Pacific Ocean and, if large enough, could fall into the ocean and generate tsunamis, though unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Warbrick {{effectively}} {{retired from}} rugby {{after returning from}} the tour, {{with the exception of}} an appearance for Auckland in 1894, and went on to work as a farmer and tourist guide in the Bay of Plenty. In 1903 he was killed along with several others by <b>an</b> <b>eruption</b> of the Waimangu Geyser.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the remote}} {{location}} of the Itcha Range, future eruptions are not a major hazard. Future volcanism is most likely {{in the form of}} basaltic cinder cones, but eruptions of felsic magma can not be ruled out. The most immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only and includes the possibility of forest fires by lava flows and the disruption of local air traffic if <b>an</b> <b>eruption</b> column is produced. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems.|$|E
5000|$|Pantelleria, off {{the coast}} of Tunisia, {{probably}} last erupted around 1000 BC. There was <b>a</b> submarine <b>eruption</b> <b>a</b> few kilometres north-east of the island in 1891, which was probably related to the main volcano.|$|R
50|$|In 1919, <b>a</b> small <b>eruption</b> {{occurred}} at Nishi-Iwate.|$|R
50|$|Prurigo is <b>an</b> itchy <b>eruption</b> of the skin.|$|R
5|$|Blackburn {{first became}} {{interested}} in the possibility of <b>an</b> <b>eruption</b> at Mount St. Helens in March 1980, when a series of earthquakes rocked the volcano. Having already climbed the mountain, he was intrigued by the situation and was eventually assigned to document the activity of the volcano for his outdoor skills and his meticulousness. By May, he had begun camping out at the volcano as a joint project to take pictures of the volcanic phenomena for The Columbian, National Geographic, and the United States Geological Survey.|$|E
5|$|In late 1805 {{and early}} 1806, {{members of the}} Lewis and Clark Expedition spotted Mount St. Helens from the Columbia River but did not report either an ongoing {{eruption}} or recent evidence of one. They did however report the presence of quicksand and clogged channel conditions {{at the mouth of}} the Sandy River near Portland, suggesting <b>an</b> <b>eruption</b> by Mount Hood sometime in the previous decades.|$|E
5|$|In late 1984, geologists {{noticed that}} seismic {{activity}} in the area had begun to increase. Increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and phreatic eruptions also alerted geologists to the possibility of <b>an</b> <b>eruption.</b> Phreatic events, when rising magma encounters water, continued well into September 1985 (one major event took place on September 11, 1985), shooting steam high into the air. Activity began to decline in October, probably because the new magma had finished ascending into Nevado del Ruiz's volcanic edifice.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> lateral <b>eruption,</b> {{also called}} <b>a</b> flank <b>eruption</b> or lateral blast if explosive, is <b>a</b> {{volcanic}} <b>eruption</b> {{that takes place}} on the flanks of a volcano instead of at the summit. Lateral eruptions are typical at rift zones where a volcano is breaking apart. Since {{it is easier for}} molten rock to flow laterally out the sides of weak s, the flank gives way before magma is pushed up through a conduit that feeds magma to the summit. These features are commonly found at shield volcanoes and produce basaltic lava flows and cinder cones.|$|R
