40|$|Abstract: Silicon {{quantum dots}} (Si-QDs) have great {{potential}} for biomedical applications, including their use as biological fluorescent markers and carriers for drug delivery systems. Biologically inert Si-QDs are less toxic than conventional cadmium-based QDs, and can modify {{the surface of the}} Si-QD with covalent bond. We synthesized water-soluble alminoprofen-conjugated Si-QDs (Ap-Si). <b>Alminoprofen</b> is a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used as an analgesic for rheumatism. Our results showed that the ―silicon drug ‖ is less toxic than the control Si-QD and the original drug. These phenomena indicate that the condensed surface integration of ligand/receptor-type drugs might reduce the adverse interaction between the cells and drug molecules. In addition, the medicinal effect of the Si-QDs (i. e., the inhibition of COX- 2 enzyme) was maintained compared to that of the original drug. The same drug effect is related to the integration ratio of original drugs, which might control the binding interaction between COX- 2 and the silicon drug. We conclude that drug conjugation with biocompatible Si-QDs is a potential method for functional pharmaceutical drug development...|$|E
