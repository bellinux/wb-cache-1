5|$|Silver {{is usually}} {{found in nature}} {{combined}} with other metals, or in minerals that contain silver compounds, generally {{in the form of}} sulfides such as galena (lead sulfide) or cerussite (lead carbonate). So the primary production of silver requires the smelting and then cupellation of <b>argentiferous</b> <b>lead</b> ores, a historically important process. Lead melts at 327°C, lead oxide at 888°C and silver melts at 960°C. To separate the silver, the alloy is melted again at the high temperature of 960°C to 1000°C in an oxidizing environment. The lead oxidises to lead monoxide, then known as litharge, which captures the oxygen from the other metals present. The liquid lead oxide is removed or absorbed by capillary action into the hearth linings.|$|E
25|$|In the 1890s, Captain Borlase's {{efforts to}} save labour costs {{involved}} {{improvements to the}} mill, making it a continuous process. Ore from the mine was separated into three size fractions before crushing the larger ones. The crushed ore was passed through cylindrical trommels so that fractions of different sizes could be sent to separate jigs. Vibrating tables replaced some of the round buddles to treat fine material, and an {{effort was made to}} recover some of the zinc blende in the ore, but this seems not to have been successful. Water provided the motive power in the mill. Smelting and refining remained labour-intensive and costly. In 1903 {{the decision was made to}} stop separating the silver and to sell <b>argentiferous</b> <b>lead</b> to a smelting company. This created an overall saving of 14shillings per ton of lead sold, roughly £750 per year. With labour shortages during World WarI and reduced ore production, it was decided to cease smelting altogether in 1917 and sell the lead concentrates.|$|E
60|$|Silver, in {{the form}} of a chloride, sulphuret, or an amalgam, or in its native state, and {{associated}} with lead and other metals, and at Arqueros with pure native copper, occurs chiefly in the upper great gypseous or cretaceo-oolitic formation which forms probably the richest mass in Chile. We may instance the mining districts of Arqueros near Coquimbo, and of nearly the whole valley of Copiapo, and of Iquique (where the principal veins run N.E. by E. and S.W. by W.), in Peru. Hence comes Molina's remark, that silver is born in the cold and solitary deserts of the Upper Cordillera. There are, however, exceptions to this rule: at Paral (S.E. of Coquimbo) silver is found in the porphyritic conglomerate formation; as I suspect is likewise the case at S. Pedro de Nolasko in the Peuquenes Pass. Rich <b>argentiferous</b> <b>lead</b> is found in the clay-slate of the Uspallata range; and I saw an old silver-mine in a hill of syenite at the foot of the Bell of Quillota: I was also assured that silver has been found in the andesitic and porphyritic region between the town of Copiapo and the Pacific. I have stated in a previous part of this chapter, that in two neighbouring mines at Arqueros the veins in one were productive when they traversed the singular green sedimentary beds, and unproductive when crossing the reddish beds; whereas at the other mine exactly the reverse takes place; I have also described the singular and rare case of numerous particles of native silver and of the chloride being disseminated in the green rock at the distance of a yard from the vein. Mercury occurs with silver both at Arqueros and at Copiapo: at the base of C. de los Hornos (S.E. of Coquimbo, a different place from Los Hornos, before mentioned) I saw in a syenitic rock numerous quartzose veins, containing a little cinnabar in nests: there were here other parallel veins of copper and of a ferrugino-auriferous ore. I believe tin has never been found in Chile.|$|E
50|$|When {{actively}} mined, {{the silver}} vein of <b>argentiferous</b> galena (silver-bearing <b>lead)</b> {{was large and}} well defined. The silver and lead was easily milled and smelted. The lead content sometimes was as much as 50 per cent of the ore, and assays proved the silver content ran as high as $105.00 per ton in 1881 dollars.|$|R
50|$|They {{may have}} been formed in <b>argentiferous</b> (silver bearing) <b>lead</b> sulfide {{containing}} spotty amounts of copper and zinc. These deposits are usually deeply oxidized and enriched by irregular replacement bodies along mineralized fissure zones and anticlinal rolls cut by Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary formations. Ore bodies are often closely associated with newer cross-cutting intrusive dikes of Laramide.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>argentiferous</b> galena (<b>lead</b> sulphide, {{containing}} {{small amounts}} of silver), which the miners sought, occurred as ribs, strings and dispersed pockets throughout the vein. Many strings of galena, varying in thickness between 1/8 of an inch (2mm) and about , were interspersed through the vein, and sometimes spread into the rock {{on the east side}} of the vein (the hanging wall of the fault). The mineralised parts of the vein were mostly found in four areas, known as [...] "ore shoots." [...] Their position was determined by the steepness of the fault plane. In general, areas where the fault dipped at more than 70°, were mineralised, but where the dip was less than 70° the vein was barren, filled with the light coloured soft fault breccia which the miners called [...] "chunk." [...] The mineralised parts of the vein, at least in the lower part of the mine, had an average lead content of 7%.|$|R

50|$|The {{population}} {{was for the}} most part agricultural and pastoral. The only industries were carpetweaving and the manufacture of cotton and silk stuffs. There were mines of chrome, mercury, sulphur, cinnabar, <b>argentiferous</b> <b>lead</b> and rock salt. The principal exports were salt, minerals, opium, cotton, cereals, wool and livestock; and the imports cloth-goods, coffee, rice and petroleum. The vilayet was traversed by the Anatolian railway, and contained the railhead of the Ottoman line from Smyrna.|$|E

50|$|The Pattinson {{process was}} {{patented}} by its inventor, Hugh Lee Pattinson, in 1833. It depended on well-known material properties; essentially that lead and silver melt at different temperatures. The equipment {{consisted of a}} row of about 8-9 iron pots, which could be heated from below. <b>Argentiferous</b> <b>lead</b> was charged to the central pot and melted. This was then allowed to cool, as the lead solidified, it was skimmed off {{and moved to the}} next pot in one direction, and the remaining metal was then transferred to the next pot in the opposite direction. The process was repeated in the pots successively, and resulted in lead accumulating in the pot at one end and silver in that at the other. The process was economic for lead containing at least 250 grams of silver per ton.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} major phase of mining in the Upper Harz from 1524, {{smelting}} was gradually moved into fixed sites. The transportation of logs as rafts {{and the use of}} water power led to the selection of advantageous sites on the rivers in the Harz - such as the Innerste, Grane and Oker. At one location that had already been used in medieval times (1180), the Frankenscharrn Hut emerged, which later became the Clausthal Lead Smelting Works (Bleihütte Clausthal), the most famous one in the Upper Harz. It was worked until 31 December 1967. Other important smelters were the silver works (Silberhütte) in Lautenthal (later merged with the Bleihütte Clausthal), the silver works in Altenau (to 1911) and the Andreasberg Silver Works (Silberhütte Andreasberg, to 1912). After the Upper Harz metal works were closed the ores of the remaining Grund Ore Mine were reduced in the Upper Harz works (to 1981) and finally in the Binsfeldhammer Lead Works near Aachen. The various metalworks, especially the Clausthal Works left behind considerable environmental damage. By contrast, the buildings and facilities in the Upper Harz have completely disappeared. From the first mining period until just before the industrial age the so-called precipitation method (Niederschlagsarbeit) was used in the Upper Harz. Instead of the usual roasting (desulphurising) of the ore, the slag was melted using charcoal with granulated iron (Eisengranalien) as a reduction medium using the roast-reaction process (Röst-Reaktions-Verfahren) (direct conversion from metal sulphide to metal) in arched kilns (Krummofen). The comparatively low kiln temperatures of around 1000 °C produced no liquid slag, the residue (gangue) remained in solid form. Not until the development of more powerful fan shaft kilns around 1850 were the concentrates roasted in double-deck ovens (Etagenöfen) and sintering pans and then melted in crucible shaft kilns (Tiegelschaftofen) on silver-containing <b>argentiferous</b> <b>lead</b> (Werkblei) and molten slag. The <b>argentiferous</b> <b>lead</b> was initially worked immediately in the German tests on lightened silver. At the start of the 20th century a multi-stage refining process was carried out in Kesselherden and silver extracted using the Parkes process.|$|E

50|$|The mining {{industry}} in the Harz has its origins about 3,000 years ago during the Bronze Age. The seven Upper Harz mining towns - Clausthal, Zellerfeld, Bad Grund, Sankt Andreasberg, Lautenthal, Altenau and Wildemann - and around 30 other villages within and {{on the edge of}} the Harz can thank the Upper Harz mining and smelting industries for their boom. The former imperial town of Goslar, too, whose splendour depended on the ore treasures of the Rammelsberg, mined <b>argentiferous</b> <b>lead</b> ore for centuries. Mining heavily dominated the economic life of the Harz as well as its scenery. Miners created the famous engineering system for the management of water in the Upper Harz, the Upper Harz Water Regale, of which 70 kilometres of ditch and 68 'ponds' (with a volume of 8 million cubic metres) are still used today. Without using their considerable hydropower output, silver mining in the Harz would never have been able to attain its major economic significance.|$|E
50|$|There {{are very}} few {{literary}} references to sources for silver. It is also difficult to identify the actual origin of the silver and the mines from those areas in which the majority of trade occurred. Because silver was used as currency {{it is even more}} difficult to pinpoint an area of origination due to its vast circulation. The 'Silver Mountains' mentioned in association with the campaigns of Sargon of Akkad are identified as the mines found at Keban on the Upper Euphrates. Other, more generic, silver-producing areas are Aratta, Dilmun, Elam, Marḫashi (also known as Barhashi or Parahshum) and Meluḫḫa. Some known areas in Iran containing <b>argentiferous</b> <b>lead</b> that could have been exploited at this time are Azerbaijan, Kerman, and the Miyana-Zanjan region. Anatolia, especially the mining region of Bolkardag in the Taurus Mountains, is also well known for silver-bearing ore deposits and probably supplied most of the silver to Mesopotamia at this time.|$|E
5000|$|The València plains {{are known}} for their olive, mulberry, ilex, algaroba, orange, and palm trees, with the {{appearance}} of an [...] "immense garden". Such is the fertility of the soil, that two and three crops in the year are generally obtained, and the greater part of the land returns eight per cent. The rice crops are the most valuable, and are chiefly produced in the tract which is irrigated by the Albufera, a large lake in the neighbourhood of València. Rice being the principal food of the lower classes, the crop is generally consumed in the province, {{with the exception of a}} small quantity which finds its way into Castile and Andalusia. The other chief product is the white mulberry, once the source of great wealth: it was worked in the silk-factories of València. In 1828, the produce of silk from the vega of València amounted to one million of pounds yearly, the greater part of which was exported in its raw state, but the produce has greatly increased since, owing to demands from the manufacturers of Lyon and other towns in the south of France. The province of València is a notable producer of satins, silk ribbons, and velvets. The export of fruit from Valencia is also considerable, particularly of raisins. The raisins are of two kinds, the muscatel, and an inferior and smaller raisin, called pasa de legia. The export of figs, oil, and wine from the province and ports of València is also considerable, with a wine known as Beni Carlo, which as of 1843 was shipped to Cette. Mercury, copper, sulphur, arsenic, <b>argentiferous</b> <b>lead,</b> iron, coal, etc. are among the mineral products, but they are procured only in small quantities. Today, tourism is a major source of income, with the city of Valencia and the resort towns along the coast being the primary earners during the summer months.|$|E
