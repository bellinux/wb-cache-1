5|$|For all his overmastering zeal, Bernard was {{by nature}} neither a bigot nor a persecutor. As in the First Crusade, the preaching {{inadvertently}} led to attacks on Jews; a fanatical French monk named Rudolf was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the Rhineland, Cologne, Mainz, Worms and Speyer, with Rudolf claiming Jews were not contributing financially {{to the rescue}} of the Holy Land. Bernard, the Archbishop of Cologne and the Archbishop of Mainz were vehemently opposed to these attacks, and so Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany {{to deal with the problem}} <b>and</b> <b>quiet</b> the mobs. Bernard then found Rudolf in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.|$|E

5|$|Before the launch, Metroplex sacrifices {{himself by}} {{transferring}} {{all of his}} Energon to the Ark. Optimus then calls for the launch to try and escape through the portal before it closes, but the Decepticons arrive in the Nemesis to stop them. Soundwave leads {{the first wave of}} troops onto the ship through giant cables and destroys the Arks automated defense system. Optimus sends Jetfire into space to disengage the cables. Bruticus launches from the Nemesis and destroys the Arks fuel line before being fatally injured and blasted off the ship into empty space by Jazz and Jetfire. Nearby, Bumblebee takes the fatal hit for Optimus and the two rival leaders engage in a battle to death. Depending on the players choice to play as either Optimus or Megatron, one manages to defeat the other and deal a fatal blow. But before the final blow can be dealt, both Optimus and Megatron are pulled off of the hull of the Ark and into the portal with both ships. The portal finally closes, leaving their home planet in peace <b>and</b> <b>quiet.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1999, Monster Ballads, {{a series}} of {{compilation}} albums that feature popular power ballads, usually from the glam metal genre, capitalized on the nostalgia, with the first volume going platinum. The VH1 sponsored Rock Never Stops Tour, beginning in 1998, has seen many glam metal bands take to the stage again, including on the inaugural tour: Warrant, Slaughter, Quiet Riot, FireHouse, and L.A. Guns. Slaughter also {{took part in the}} 1999 version with Ted Nugent, Night Ranger, <b>and</b> <b>Quiet</b> Riot. Poison and Cinderella toured together in 2000 and 2002, and in 2005 Cinderella headlined the Rock Never Stops Tour, with support from Ratt, Quiet Riot, and FireHouse. In 2007 the four-day-long Rocklahoma festival held in Oklahoma included glam metal bands Poison, Ratt and Twisted Sister. Warrant and Cinderella co-headlined the festival in 2008. Nostalgia for the genre was evidenced in the production of the glam metal themed musical Rock of Ages, which ran in Los Angeles in 2006 and in New York in 2008. It was made into a film released in 2012.|$|E

When she leaves, Homer wakes up and finds Marge is gone and so is the demolition derby form, so he heads off to the derby with the kids to stop her. Although Marge initially enjoys the demolition derby, things soon get too dangerous for her. Homer has no idea how to save her, as he has given up being reckless. Bart comes up with an idea and calls for a beer can from a vendor. Homer then drinks the beer and rescues Marge (in a style similar to Popeye), who makes him promise not to make her the live wire in the family.|$|E

5|$|In 1823, {{the family}} moved to the village of Georgetown, Ohio, where five more {{siblings}} were born: Simpson, Clara, Orvil, Jennie, and Mary. At the age of five, young Grant began his formal education, starting at a subscription school and later was enrolled in two private schools. In the winter of 1836–1837, Grant was a student at Maysville Seminary, and in the autumn of 1838 he attended John Rankin's academy. In his youth, Grant developed an unusual ability to ride, work with, and control horses. Expressing a strong dislike for the tannery, Grant's father instead put this ability to use giving Ulysses work driving wagon loads of supplies and transporting people. Unlike his siblings, Grant was not forced to attend church by his Methodist parents. For the rest of his life, he prayed privately and never officially joined any denomination. To others, including late in life, his own son, Grant appeared to be an agnostic. He inherited some of Hannah's Methodist piety <b>and</b> <b>quiet</b> nature while adopting his father's Whig political inclinations.|$|E
5|$|On 18September Huskisson's {{body was}} placed in a coffin and covered with black silk. Shortly before midnight a team of men {{prepared}} to move the coffin to a hearse which had been parked outside since the afternoon, but Emily Huskisson refused to allow them to take the body. Instead, she spent another night in the vicarage with the coffin. The next morning she left in a horse-drawn carriage with the windows covered. The coffin, meanwhile, set off in the hearse for Liverpool. Although the funeral party changed horses only at remote <b>and</b> <b>quiet</b> coaching inns to avoid attention, it gathered followers as it progressed; by the time it reached Liverpool Town Hall late that evening, the hearse was followed by at least 10 carriages and more than 500 mourners on foot.|$|E
5|$|The city's neighborhoods {{emerge from}} {{historic}} ethnic, religious and caste divisions. The assignment of certain neighborhoods to particular noble sub-castes under the Kingdom of Imerina established divisions; {{the highest ranking}} nobles were typically assigned to neighborhoods closest to the royal palace and were required to live in higher elevation portions of the city. During and after French colonization, expansion of the city continued to reflect these divisions. Today, the calm <b>and</b> <b>quiet</b> haute ville is mainly residential and viewed as a prestigious area in which to live; many of the city's wealthiest and most influential Malagasy families live there. The part of la haute closest to the Rova contains much of the city's pre-colonial heritage and is considered its historic part. It includes the royal palace, Andafiavaratra Palacethe former residence of Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony, Andohalothe principal town square until 1897, a cathedral near Andohalo built to commemorate early Malagasy Christian martyrs, the city's most intact historic entrance gate and the 19th-century houses of Merina nobles.|$|E

5|$|The {{eggs are}} {{incubated}} {{for an average}} of 11days (range 10–16). Both adults incubate, although only the female stays on the nest at night. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 11–12days after hatching, leaving the nest shortly before they are able to fly. They are assisted with feeding for a further two or three weeks. If the nest is threatened, the non-incubating bird gives an alarm call so that the sitting parent and chicks stay still <b>and</b> <b>quiet.</b> A male blackcap may mob a potential predator, or try to lure it away with disjointed runs and flaps on the ground. The blackcap normally raises just one brood, but second nestings are sometimes recorded, particularly in the milder climate of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic islands; triple brooding has been observed once, the female laying a total of 23 eggs in the season.|$|E
5|$|The lens {{features}} a hypersonic zoom motor for its autofocus, {{which is considered}} to be a fast <b>and</b> <b>quiet</b> design. In addition, manual override is allowed in the single-shot autofocus mode. The lens, which focuses internally, has one of the lowest maximum magnification measurements in its class (which includes the Canon 10–18mm and 10–22mm, Sigma 10–20mm f/3.5 and Sigma 10–20mm f/4–5.6 EX DC HSM, Tamron 10–24mm f/3.5–4.5 DI II, Nikon 10–24mm f/3.5–4.5G ED AF-S DX, and Tokina 11–16mm f/2.8 AT-X Pro DX lenses). The lens' autofocus feature is not functional with Pentax ist* series and K100D DSLR cameras that do not support hypersonic zoom mechanics. The lens is capable of focusing from infinity to minimum focusing distance and back in under a second: so micro focusing is rapid. However, because of the narrow focus range (0.13x) the lens is not suitable for macro photography.|$|E
5|$|The series plot {{revolves}} around Sheriff Andy Taylor (Andy Griffith) {{and his life}} in sleepy, slow-paced fictional Mayberry, North Carolina. Sheriff Taylor's level-headed approach to law enforcement makes him the scourge of local moonshiners and out-of-town criminals, while his abilities to settle community problems with common-sense advice, mediation, and conciliation make him popular with his fellow citizens. His professional life, however, {{is complicated by the}} repeated gaffes of his inept deputy, Barney Fife (Don Knotts). Barney is portrayed as Andy's cousin in the first, second, and sixth episodes, but is never again referred to as such. Andy socializes with male friends in the Main Street barber shop and dates various ladies until a schoolteacher becomes his steady interest in season three. At home, Andy enjoys fishing trips with his son, Opie (Ronny Howard), <b>and</b> <b>quiet</b> evenings on the front porch with his maiden aunt and housekeeper, Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier). Opie tests his father's parenting skills season after season, and Aunt Bee's ill-considered romances and adventures cause her nephew concern.|$|E
