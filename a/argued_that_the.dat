5|$|Although not {{commonly}} {{understood as}} Gnostic, many scholars, including Bultmann, have forcefully <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Gospel of John has elements {{in common with}} Gnosticism. Christian Gnosticism did not fully develop until the mid-2nd century, and so 2nd-century Proto-Orthodox Christians concentrated much effort in examining and refuting it. To say John's gospel contained elements of Gnosticism is to assume that Gnosticism had developed to a level that required the author to respond to it. Bultmann, for example, <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> opening theme of the Gospel of John, the pre-existing Logos, was actually a Gnostic theme. Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown have <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pre-existing Logos theme arises from the more ancient Jewish writings in the eighth chapter of the Book of Proverbs, and was fully developed as a theme in Hellenistic Judaism by Philo Judaeus.|$|E
5|$|Bowman <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{authorized}} sale of {{the seeds}} extinguished the patent, and that Bowman merely used seeds legitimately purchased from the silo. He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created {{an exception to the}} exhaustion doctrine, and that this decision was properly for Congress to decide. Monsanto <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> second-generation seeds were not subject to exhaustion because they had not existed until Bowman created them and had not been sold at the time of infringement. He noted that even when exhaustion applied, it did not allow one to create new copies of the patented product, which the second-generation seeds were.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> book <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> primary {{weakness}} of the United States in military matters is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> US views revolution in military thought solely in terms of technology. <b>The</b> book further <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> to <b>the</b> US, military doctrine evolves because new technology allows new capabilities. As such, <b>the</b> book <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States does not consider the wider picture of military strategy, which includes legal and economic factors. The book proceeds to <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States is vulnerable to attacks along these lines.|$|R
5|$|Bowman then {{appealed the}} {{decision}} to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Bowman <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Monsanto license agreement allowed the sale of second-generation soybeans to both grain elevators and subsequent buyers and that this caused the patent rights to be exhausted per the United States Supreme Court's ruling in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc. Monsanto <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> license agreement specifically prohibited the use of second-generation seeds for planting. The Federal Circuit upheld the lower court's decision in favor of Monsanto.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{possible}} ways the poem was composed. The first, Mason's concept, {{argues that the}} Eton copy was the original for the Elegy poem and was complete in itself. Later critics claimed that the original was more complete than the later version; Roger Lonsdale <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> early version had a balance that set up the debate, and was clearer than the later version. Lonsdale also <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> early poem fits classical models, including Virgil's Georgics and Horace's Epodes. The early version of the poem was finished, according to Mason, in August 1742, {{but there is little}} evidence to give such a definite date.

40|$|In the thesis, Fodor’s {{arguments}} against computationalism are defeated. His arguments appeal to syntactic constraints and intractability. We <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> arguments based on syntactic constraints are not satisfactory. We then <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> argument via intractability is not satisfactory either. We also discuss various {{approaches to the}} problem of abduction in a computationalist setting. We <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> social solution <b>that</b> human everyday cognitive activity is not isotropic and Quinean is correct. Secondly, we <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> local solution is too preliminary a proposal.

Thirdly, we <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> natural language approach is circular. Fourthly, we arguedthat the web search approach provides a partial account of finding relevant information but leaves out the key problem of evaluating the search results.

The friars of the Church of St. Augustine sued the city of Philadelphia for not providing the church with adequate protection, claiming $80,000 in damages. The city <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> friars could not claim their civil rights were violated, as the Order of St. Augustine was a foreign organization under the Pope. Furthermore, the city <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> friars took a vow of poverty {{and could not be}} property owners.

5|$|Brentwood Academy {{sued the}} {{association}} over this action. Brentwood <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{enforcement of the}} rule constituted state action which they claimed violated the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The school asserted that their due process rights had been violated {{because there were no}} evidentiary hearings to determine the validity of the claim that they inappropriately recruited football players. Further, they <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rule violated their freedom of speech because it restricted the ways the Academy could recruit. In July 1998, the District Court agreed with this argument and granted summary judgement to the Academy, while enjoining the association from enforcing the rule. A year later, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision, finding that the actions of the association did not constitute 'state action'.
