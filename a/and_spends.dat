40|$|While the law {{governing}} {{the electoral process}} has changed dramatically in the past decade, one thing has stayed the same: Courts and commentators continue to view voting in elections <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> on elections through distinct constitutional lenses. On the spending side, First Amendment principles guide judicial analysis, and recent decisions have been strongly deregulatory. On the voting side, courts rely on a makeshift equal protection-oriented framework, and they {{have tended to be}} more accepting of regulation. Key voting <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> precedents seldom cite each other. Similarly, election law scholars typically address voting <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> in isolation. This Article challenges the prevailing, bifurcated approach to voting <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> law. It maintains that the law’s disparate handling of voting <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> is unjustified. Voting <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> are, at bottom, two methods of participating in the electoral process. Conceiving them as two aspects of a broader right to participate—a right the Supreme Court recently articulated, but did not develop, in McCutcheon v. FEC—offers a principled basis to harmonize voting <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> law <b>and</b> reorient election law discourse...|$|R

40|$|Borrow <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> is {{a policy}} with several weaknesses. 1, it {{involves}} government borrowing something, that is money, which government can create in limitless quantities any time. 2, the “borrow” part of borrow <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> is deflationary: {{the opposite of the}} desired effect. 3, borrow <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> may result in interest rate increases and crowding out. To get round this, governments print extra money and buy back government securities. This is a charade: governments here are engaged in “print and spend” while pretending to effect “borrow and spend”. 4, when borrowings are paid back, the initial reflationary effect is reversed, thus borrow <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> does not have a permanent effect, whereas print <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> does. 5, {{one of the ways that}} borrow <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> works is that it supplies the private sector with additional assets (bonds which pay interest). This reduces “paradox of thrift” unemployment. But the private sector actually NEEDS or WANTS these assets, thus there is no need to pay interest to induce the recipients to accept those assets. Put another way, governments should issue zero interest bonds (i. e. cash) not interest paying bonds. 6, Borrow <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> expands the national debt, some of which will be held by foreigners. Paying interest to foreigners when no interest needs to be paid makes even less sense than paying such interest to natives. For the purposes of influencing unemployment and inflation, print <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> is a superior policy to adjusting interest rates because the latter is distortionary. ...|$|R

5|$|Some frogs {{have become}} adapted for {{burrowing}} {{and a life}} underground. They tend to have rounded bodies, short limbs, small heads with bulging eyes, and hind feet adapted for excavation. An extreme {{example of this is}} the purple frog (Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis) from southern India which feeds on termites <b>and</b> <b>spends</b> almost its whole life underground. It emerges briefly during the monsoon to mate and breed in temporary pools. It has a tiny head with a pointed snout and a plump, rounded body. Because of this fossorial existence, it was first described in 2003, being new to the scientific community at that time, although previously known to local people.|$|E

5|$|The willie wagtail is insectivorous <b>and</b> <b>spends</b> {{much time}} chasing prey in open habitat.
