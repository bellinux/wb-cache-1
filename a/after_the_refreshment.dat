60|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>refreshments</b> came {{more games}} and some singing, {{and it was}} nine o'clock before the lawn party came to an end. The girls and boys from the town went home mostly in pairs, but Ben {{remained}} behind, for he knew Dave and Phil had something to tell. All the lads congregated in the summerhouse and Laura and Jessie went with them.|$|R
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> game <b>refreshments</b> {{were served}} to the cadets and their {{particular}} friends, and in this, of course, the Rovers {{and the girls}} from Clearwater Hall joined. Then the boys took the girls back to their school in an automobile.|$|R

500|$|Our {{reception}} exceeded our expectations. [...] We {{found nothing}} but civility, elegance, and plenty. [...] <b>After</b> <b>the</b> usual <b>refreshments,</b> and <b>the</b> usual conversation, the evening came upon us. [...] The carpet was then {{rolled off the}} floor; the musician was called, and the whole company was invited to dance, nor did ever fairies trip with greater alacrity. [...] The general air of festivity, which predominated in this place, so far remote from all those regions which the mind {{has been used to}} contemplate as the mansions of pleasure, struck the imagination with a delightful surprise, analogous to that which is felt at an unexpected emersion from darkness into light.|$|R
60|$|Grace {{received}} {{me with an}} angelic smile; but, I almost gasped {{for breath}} as I noticed the prodigious change that had come over her in so brief a space. She now {{looked more like a}} being of another world than ever; and this, too, immediately <b>after</b> coming from <b>the</b> <b>refreshment</b> of a night's rest. I kissed her forehead, which had an unnatural chill on it, I thought; and I felt the feeble pressure of an arm that was thrown affectionately round my neck. I then sat down on the transom, still holding my sister's hand. Grace looked anxiously at me for half a minute, ere she spoke, as if to ascertain how far I was conscious of her situation.|$|R
60|$|No {{wonder she}} had dreamt of cold golden limbs, for {{her feet were}} really chilly as ice, and the room as dark as at midnight. However {{it was not yet}} seven o'clock; and {{presently}} Janet brought a light, and persuaded her to come downstairs and warm herself. She was not yet capable of going into the dining-room to the family tea, but crept down to lie on the sofa in the drawing-room; and there, <b>after</b> taking <b>the</b> small <b>refreshment</b> which was all she could yet endure, she lay with closed eyes, while the children came in from the meal. Armine and Babie were the first. She knew they were looking at her, but was too weary to exert herself to speak to them.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>refreshment</b> {{rooms were}} {{extended}} in 1896, and, {{except for the}} addition of the signal box in 1902, the station buildings remained the same until <b>the</b> <b>refreshment</b> rooms were closed about 1952.|$|R
50|$|The massive {{buildings}} were the finest outside Adelaide, with <b>the</b> <b>refreshment</b> rooms being open for all passenger trains.

5000|$|Mr. E. W. Ruddick leased <b>the</b> Woodville <b>Refreshment</b> Rooms from <b>the</b> Railways Department and {{operated}} a private dining room there until 1921. In 1919, {{on account of}} the inadequacy of the facilities during the busy season, he requested an extra room be provided. In 1921, <b>the</b> <b>refreshment</b> room was assimilated by the Railways Department and run by <b>the</b> <b>Refreshment</b> Branch. [...] By the time the railcars arrived, the only victuals on offer were tea and sandwiches. [...] Losses continued to mount for <b>the</b> <b>Refreshment</b> Branch due in part to faster trains, and following the recommendations of the 1952 Royal Commission, <b>the</b> Woodville <b>refreshment</b> room was immediately closed. [...] The dining room was deemed to be in excess of the requirements of <b>the</b> <b>Refreshment</b> Branch, and reallocated for use as office space, including that of the Inspector of the Permanent Way, and the kitchen was converted for use as a communications equipment room. Woodville’s dining room was once described by New Zealand author Katherine Mansfield as [...] "a great barn of a place - full of primly papered chandeliers and long tables - decorated with paper flowers - and humanity most painfully in evidence." ...|$|R
