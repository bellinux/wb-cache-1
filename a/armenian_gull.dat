40|$|The Caucasus, at {{the border}} of Europe and Asia, is {{important}} for migration and over-wintering of wild waterbirds. Three flyways, the Central Asian, East Africa-West Asia, and Mediterranean/Black Sea flyways, converge in the Caucasus region. Thus, the Caucasus region might act as a migratory bridge for influenza virus transmission when birds aggregate in high concentrations in the post-breeding, migrating and overwintering periods. Since August 2009, we have established a surveillance network for influenza viruses in wild birds, using five sample areas geographically spread throughout suitable habitats in both eastern and western Georgia. We took paired tracheal and cloacal swabs and fresh feces samples. We collected 8343 swabs from 76 species belonging to 17 families in 11 orders of birds, of which 84 were real-time RT-PCR positive for avian influenza virus (AIV). No highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) H 5 or H 7 viruses were detected. The overall AIV prevalence was 1. 6 %. We observed peak prevalence in large gulls during the autumn migration (5. 3 – 9. 8 %), but peak prevalence in Black-headed Gulls in spring (4. 2 – 13 %). In ducks, we observed increased AIV prevalence during the autumn post-moult aggregations and migration stop-over period (6. 3 %) but at lower levels to those observed in other more northerly post-moult areas in Eurasia. We observed another prevalence peak in the overwintering period (0. 14 – 5. 9 %). Serological and virological monitoring of a breeding colony of <b>Armenian</b> <b>Gulls</b> showed that adult birds were seropositive o...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Armenian</b> <b>gull</b> (Larus armenicus) {{is a large}} gull {{found in}} the Caucasus and Middle East. It was {{formerly}} classified as a subspecies of the herring gull (L. argentatus) but is now {{generally considered to be}} a separate species although BirdLife International lumps it with the yellow-legged gull (L. michahellis).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Armenian</b> <b>gull</b> nests beside {{mountain}} {{lakes in}} Georgia, Armenia, Turkey and western Iran. The largest colonies are at Lake Sevan and Lake Arpi in Armenia. It is a partial migrant with many birds wintering on {{the coasts of}} Turkey, Lebanon and Israel. Smaller numbers reach Cyprus, Egypt and the Persian Gulf.|$|E
50|$|Sevan {{lake and}} its {{vicinity}} {{are rich in}} avifauna. Up to 267 bird species have been recorded in Sevan Basin. The known avifauna can be grouped into the orderss: Podicipediformes, Pelecaniformes, Phoenicopteriformes, Falconiformes, Anseriformes, Galliformes, Gruiformes, Charadriiformes, Columbiformes, Cuculiformes, Strigiformes, Caprimulgiformes, Apodiformes, Coraciiformes, Piciformes, and Passeriformes. 39 species {{are included in the}} Red Book of Armenia. There is also an endemic species <b>Armenian</b> <b>gull</b> (Larus armenicus).|$|E
50|$|<b>Armenian</b> <b>gull</b> is {{the symbol}} of the province. It is {{depicted}} on the Gegharkunik coat of arms adopted on May 4, 2011, flying over the Lake Sevan and its peninsula, surrounded by the mountains of Sevan. The wheat ears {{on both sides of the}} coat of arms represent the agricultural characteristic of the province, while the opened book at the bottom represents the intellectual and cultural heritage of the region.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Armenian</b> <b>gull</b> is {{a fairly}} large gull species, though is on average the {{smallest}} of the [...] "herring gull" [...] complex. It can range from 52 to 62 cm, from 120 to 145 cm across the wings and weighs from 600 to 960 g. Among standard measurements, its wing chord is 38.5 to 45.8 cm, its bill is 4.1 to 5.6 cm and its tarsus is 5.7 to 6.4 cm. They are superficially similar to yellow-legged gulls but are slightly smaller with a slightly darker grey back and dark eyes. The area of black on the wingtips is more extensive with smaller white spots. The bill is short with a distinctive black band just before the tip. First-winter birds are mainly brown. They have a whitish rump, pale inner primary feathers and a narrow, sharply-defined black band on the tail. Although their ranges do not overlap, with its darkish mantle, both black and red near the tip of its bill and a dark eye, the <b>Armenian</b> <b>gull</b> bears a remarkable resemblance to the California gull of North America.|$|E
50|$|The {{griffon vulture}} brood their eggs at the caldera, which earned its status of special {{protected}} area as habitat for breeding of velvet duck and golden eagle. The number of bird species decreased at Lake Nemrut, which is a stopover site {{for a lot of}} migrating birds, due to irregular and uncontrolled hunting. Currently observed animals in the region are the bird species partridge, duck, bee-eater, <b>Armenian</b> <b>gull</b> and mammals hare, fox, bear. The chamois has been extinct.|$|E
50|$|It is now {{generally}} accepted that the yellow-legged gull {{is a full}} species, but until recently there was much disagreement. For example, British Birds magazine split yellow-legged gull from herring gull in 1993 but included the Caspian gull in the former, but the BOU in Great Britain retained the yellow-legged gull as a subspecies of the herring gull until 2007. DNA research however suggests that yellow-legged gull is actually closest to the great black-backed gull L. marinus and <b>Armenian</b> <b>gull</b> L. armenicus, while the Caspian gull is closer to herring gull and lesser black-backed gull L. fuscus, rather than being each other's closest relatives.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bird fauna}} {{of the lake}} and its {{vicinity}} makes over 200 species, out of which 95 species are breeding. The lake is an important breeding ground for the <b>Armenian</b> <b>gull</b> (Larus armenicus) with about 4,000-5,000 pairs. During migration the Lake is visited by wide variety of birds including raptors, such as Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus) and Steppe eagle (Aquila nipalensis), waterbirds such as red-crested pochard (Netta rufina) and ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), while during the wintering period the lake hosts another set of species such as Bewick's swan (Cygnus columbianus) and great black-headed gull (Larus ichthyaetus). Sometimes the lake is visited by very rare Armenian migrant lesser white-fronted goose (Anser erythropus).|$|E
