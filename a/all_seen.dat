These moves include: subdividing an edge; valence-one homotopy (getting rid of a degree-one vertex); valence-two homotopy (getting rid of a degree-two vertex); collapsing an invariant forest; and folding. Of these moves the valence-one homotopy always reduced the PerronFrobenius eigenvalue.|$|E

25|$|The Klingon {{military}} {{is divided into}} the Navy (serving in space) and the Marines (serving as ground troops rather than shipboard security). There are six enlisted ranks (including warrant officers), seven officer ranks and one cadet rank for officer training. There is significant rivalry between the two branches. Discipline is routinely maintained by the agonizer booth (that stimulates pain nerves without causing physical harm) {{as well as the}} threat of summary execution. Officer candidates spend four or five years in an academy and one year on a cadet cruise. More training is required of commanders. Academy life is spartan, with medicine and food being considered privileges not rights. Marines are often transported in a form of suspended animation with approximately 4% of troops not surviving the awakening process. Klingon mass transporters (for rapid deployment of troops) have a 2% casualty rate. These losses are <b>all</b> <b>seen</b> as acceptable.|$|E
25|$|The Yoga Sutras {{are built}} on a {{foundation}} of Samkhya philosophy, an orthodox (Astika) and atheistic Hindu system of dualism, and are generally seen as the practice while Samkhya is the theory. The influence of Samkhya is so pervasive in the Sutras that the historian Surendranath Dasgupta {{went so far as}} to deny independent categorization to Patañjali's system, preferring to refer to it as Patanjala Samkhya, similar to the position taken by the Jain writer Haribhadra in his commentary on Yoga. Patañjali's Yoga Sutras accept the Samkhya's division of the world and phenomena into twenty-five tattvas or principles, of which one is Purusha meaning Self or consciousness, the others being Prakriti (primal nature), Buddhi (intellect or will), Ahamkara (ego), Manas (mind), five buddhindriyas (sensory capabilities), five karmendriyas (action-capabilities) and ten elements. The second part of the Sutras, the Sadhana, also summarizes the Samkhya perspectives about <b>all</b> <b>seen</b> activity lying within the realm of the three Gunas of Sattva (illumination), Rajas (passion) and Tamas (lethargy).|$|E

500|$|In the 2007–08 season, Kisnorbo was {{relegated to}} League One with the club, {{but was also}} on the {{receiving}} end of no less than three controversial refereeing decisions. His first was a goal against Scunthorpe United on 20 October, which referee Scott Mathieson ruled out for an offside, depriving Leicester of an away win. Video replay showed that Kisnorbo's disallowed goal was actually onside, greatly frustrating him, while Leicester coach Gerry Taggart commented [...] "We have <b>all</b> <b>seen</b> the replay of Patrick's goal in the dressing room and he is clearly not offside." [...] Kisnorbo's second was a red card by referee Phil Joslin for what the linesman claimed was a foul on Pablo Couñago. Joslin awarded Ipswich Town a penalty kick, and Ipswich won 3–1. Joslin admitted his mistake, and had the ban rescinded the following day after video replays showed Kisnorbo actually won the ball outside the penalty area. Leicester's then-manager Ian Holloway described the sending off as a [...] "complete kerfuffle". The Leicester club was fined £3,000 by The Football Association, however, because of Kisnorbo's teammates' angry appeals to Joslin during the game. Kisnorbo's third was another red card by referee Mike Pike for a foul on Billy Sharp on 5 April 2008. Pike awarded Sheffield United a penalty kick as they won 3–0. Video replays, however, showed no contact between the two, confirming that Sharp was diving. Holloway branded Pike's decision [...] "embarrassing", saying [...] "that was the biggest blunder I've seen in a long time." [...] Leicester also succeeded in their appeal against the second red card.|$|E

Each character is again seen in a white rectangle in the centre of the screen followed by a shot of a pair of hands holding a strip of photos of that particular person during which red text is displayed showing the character's name. A woman with short blonde hair and a red top, seen holding {{her head in her hands}} is introduced as [...] "The wife"; a bald man with blood on his head is [...] "The husband"; a woman in a white jacket with a blonde mullet hairstyle is [...] "The mistress"; a man with thick-rimmed glasses, a white jacket, and red polo neck sweater is [...] "The voyeur"; and a man in a red and black tracksuit top with a large scar running from his left eye to right cheek is [...] "The stalker".

During an instrumental break in the song, at 1 minute 38 seconds, two masked men are shown playing table tennis on another rotating dancefloor with two large fluorescent purple circles in the background. The five characters are then seen walking around the band and stepping into the photo booths that surround them. The text [...] "Act 1: The kiss" [...] is shown, after which footage of the Super Furry Animals playing along to the track is intercut with shots of the characters. [...] "The husband" [...] and [...] "The mistress" [...] kiss while a strip of photos is seen being passed through a pair of hands and [...] "The voyeur" [...] is shown using a video camera.
