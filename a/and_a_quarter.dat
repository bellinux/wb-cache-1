5|$|Models by Julio Ángel Fernández {{suggest that}} the {{scattered}} disc, which is the main source for periodic comets in the Solar System, might also be the primary source for Oort cloud objects. According to the models, {{about half of the}} objects scattered travel outward toward the Oort cloud, whereas a quarter are shifted inward to Jupiter's orbit, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> are ejected on hyperbolic orbits. The scattered disc might still be supplying the Oort cloud with material. A third of the scattered disc's population is likely to end up in the Oort cloud after 2.5billion years.|$|E

5|$|Shannon (1941–1955), named Shannon II in America, was an {{outstanding}} Australian Thoroughbred racehorse who {{was inducted into}} the Hall of Fame. He created new racecourse records in Australia before he was sold to an American buyer who exported him to California in 1948. There Shannon equalled the world record of 1:47 for the nine furlongs (1,800 metres) in winning the Forty Niner Handicap Stakes, then one week later equalled the world record of 1:59 for a mile <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> (2,000 metres). Shannon was named the 1948 American Champion Older Male Horse. At stud in America he proved to be a good sire.|$|E

Unable to continue the blockade the British force returned to India, allowing food supplies to reach Île de France. Due to the necessity for campaigns against Dutch Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies, the British blockade was not renewed, but the French were unable to take advantage due to increasing civil unrest among the island's population.|$|E

5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was first signposted in 1919, the east–west highway across the Lower Peninsula through Portland to Detroit was {{assigned}} the M-16 designation, This was redesignated US16 in 1926. The section of US16 through Portland was decommissioned on March 7, 1960. It would remain under local control {{until the first}} quarter-mile (0.4km) section was transferred to state control on September 18, 1978.

5|$|According to the Board, Grissom {{suffered}} severe third degree {{burns on}} over one-third {{of his body}} and his spacesuit was mostly destroyed. White suffered third degree burns on almost half of his body <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> of his spacesuit had melted away. Chaffee suffered third degree burns over {{almost a quarter of}} his body and a small portion of his spacesuit was damaged. The autopsy report confirmed that the primary cause of death for all three astronauts was cardiac arrest caused by high concentrations of carbon monoxide. Burns suffered by the crew were not believed to be major factors, and it was concluded that most of them had occurred postmortem. Asphyxiation happened after the fire melted the astronauts' suits and oxygen tubes, exposing them to the lethal atmosphere of the cabin.|$|E
5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large provincial town, with a {{population}} of around 5,000. In 1338 there was a successful French attack on Southampton, burning various buildings down and damaging the castle. Edward III responded by improving the quality of the town defences, including building walls along the old ditch and bank defences, and particularly focusing on improving {{the west side of the}} town, but little work appears to have been done to improve the castle itself. By the middle of the 14th century, Southampton Castle sat alongside one <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> miles (2 km) of town walls, although the castle and the walls were kept administratively separate.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{defensive}} weapons {{included the}} anti-aircraft artillery piece. The three main types were the 4.5-inch, 3.7-inch and 3-inch guns. The first two were modern, and effective over 8000 metres (26,000 feet). The last was a First World War weapon effective only to 4,250 metres (14,000 feet). Usually batteries were sited in fours, with a range-finder and predictor which measured the speeds and heights of enemy aircraft while {{taking into account}} the time shell took to reach their intended targets, thus calculating when to detonate the fuse in the shell. As with most artillery weapons firing at aircraft, the higher the shell travelled the less effective it became. A shell fired to 1,500 metres (5,000 feet) would only be half as effective at 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> as accurate at 4,500 metres (15,000 feet). The German bombers usually tried to fly around heavy concentrations of anti-aircraft guns, and if forced to fly through them, chose to fly at heights of around 4,500 metres (15,000 feet).|$|E
