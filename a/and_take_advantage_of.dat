5|$|A scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army's {{presence}} and numbers late on Thursday March 21. The next morning, a Muslim conference of war convened, {{and there was}} dispute over how to best repel the Meccans. Muhammad {{and many of the}} senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within Medina <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> its heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops, and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter, and readied the Muslim force for battle.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century both choral and organ musical {{components}} {{developed to}} a high standard and were integral to the liturgy at St James'. In addition, music was offered to the wider community {{in the form of}} recitals, often in ways that elucidate the liturgy <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> church acoustics and sacred settings. Weekday recitals, such as the organ recitals given in 1936 of music by Bach, continued in addition to the music played on Sundays.|$|E

5|$|The {{competition}} {{formed as}} the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following {{the decision of}} clubs in the Football League First Division {{to break away from}} the Football League, which was founded in 1888, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> a lucrative television rights deal. The deal was worth £1billion a year domestically as of 2013–14, with BSkyB and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively. The league generates €2.2billion per year in domestic and international television rights. In 2014–15, teams were apportioned revenues of £1,600 million, rising sharply to £2,400 million in 2016–17.|$|E
5|$|This {{iteration}} of Razer {{competed in}} the second series of Robot Wars, successfully passing the Gauntlet and Trials stages of its heat before being defeated in battle by a robot called Inquisitor. The cause of Razer's immobilisation in this fight was the shearing of nylon cush drives—cushioning blocks designed to prevent stress fractures—in the machine's drive wheels; these were replaced with more robust metal ones for future competitions. As the Robot Wars television series evolved and grew, Razer's design was revised and refined to counter weaknesses <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> rule changes; by series four, Lewis estimated that Razer had taken 1,500 hours to build, {{at a cost of}} £1,600.|$|E
5|$|Through {{coordination}} with Betances and local pro-independence leaders in Puerto Rico, a Dominican military leader, Gen. José Morales, {{made plans to}} invade Puerto Rico in the late 1890s, to supply local revolutionaries with supplies and mercenaries, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> the weak Spanish military presence in Puerto Rico (there were only 4,500 Spanish soldiers in the island at the time, and 1,000 of them were later redirected to Cuba to fight the Cuban insurrection). However, the Cuban Revolutionary Party rejected the plan as being too expensive.|$|E

5|$|Game {{developers}} {{have continued to}} increase support for machinima. Products such as Lionhead Studios' 2005 business simulation game The Movies, Linden Research's virtual world Second Life, and Bungie's 2007 first-person shooter Halo 3 encourage the creation of user content by including machinima software tools. Using The Movies, Alex Chan, a French resident with no previous filmmaking experience, took four days to create The French Democracy, a short political film about the 2005 civil unrest in France. Third-party mods like Garry's Mod usually offer the ability to manipulate characters <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> custom or migrated content, allowing {{for the creation of}} works like Counter-Strike For Kids that can be filmed using multiple games.|$|E
5|$|North American Aviation won the {{contract}} to build the CSM, and also {{the second stage of}} the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA. Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon, and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight. Also, there was no provision for docking with the Lunar Module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> the lessons learned in Block I development.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the 1745 Jacobite rising {{decimated}} the antiquated social structure based around clans lorded over by chieftains. This liberalized the Scottish way of life by allowing citizens to own land and keep the profits instead of giving all profits to the chieftains who owned all the land. Their literate foundation allowed the Scots to become economically literate <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> trade. Edinburgh and Glasgow became epicenters of intellectual thought. There existed in Scotland a clergy who believed that a moral and religious foundation was required for, and compatible with, a free and open sophisticated culture, which moderated hardline conservatives. Herman presents biographies of Francis Hutcheson, Henry Home (Lord Kames), Robert Adam, Adam Smith, and others to illustrate the Scottish development.|$|E

From 2014, this loophole was closed, with the regulations rewritten to only allow camera mountings to be used for cameras. This rule was later updated to force the teams to mount the cameras on an external piece of bodywork after Red Bull fitted its cameras within the nose of the RB10 chassis.|$|E

25|$|Sheridan {{believed}} that understanding the topography of the Shenandoah Valley {{would give him}} a strategic and tactical advantage. By the summer of 1864, Meigs was {{recognized as one of the}} best mapmakers in the Union Army. At his base in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, he spent hours being tutored by Meigs on the layout of the valley. From Meigs, Sheridan learned that the long ridges in the Shenandoah were not the great protective barriers Union commanders had assumed. The ridges had a number of gaps. Confederate forces could ride north and south, screened by the ridges, and then turn through the gaps to initiate flank attacks on Union forces. Sheridan resolved to protect his flanks from these attacks, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> the gaps himself.|$|E
