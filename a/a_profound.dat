The presence of water in vinegar has such <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> effect on acetic acid's properties that for centuries chemists believed that glacial acetic acid and the acid found in vinegar were two different substances. French chemist Pierre Adet proved them identical.|$|E

5|$|In {{the post-war}} period Scotland {{continued}} to produce important architects, including James Stirling (1926–92), who, with James Gowan (1923–) designed the Flats at Ham Common, London (1955–58), considered a landmark {{in the development}} of modernist, brutalist residential planning, a style which would have <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> impact in Scotland. Their later work, almost all of it outside Scotland, would be highly influential on an international scale.|$|E

Together, their works advanced a theory of history in which communication is central to social change and transformation.|$|E

5|$|Local people {{sometimes}} take pups for the exotic pet trade or as pets for themselves, but the animal rapidly grows to become unmanageable. Duplaix relates {{the story of}} an Arawak Indian who took two pups from their parents. While revealing of the affection held for the animals, the seizure was <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> blow to the breeding pair, which went on to lose their territory to competitors.|$|E
5|$|Narihira was not <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> poet. His {{surviving}} {{poems are}} mainly occasional, {{and even when}} the expression suggests deeply felt emotion, its worldly manner keeps his poetry from attaining {{the grandeur of the}} best Man'yōshū poems in the same vein. He is nevertheless of historical importance as one who maintained the traditions of the waka during the long night of the dominance of poetry in Chinese.|$|E

5|$|The war had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> {{effect on}} Australian society {{in other ways}} also.

5|$|A {{dispute over}} the {{succession}} to Edward led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066, accomplished by an army led by Duke William of Normandy. The Normans themselves originated from Scandinavia and had settled in Normandy in the late 9th and early 10th centuries. This conquest led to the almost total dispossession of the English elite and its replacement by a new French-speaking aristocracy, whose speech had <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> and permanent effect on the English language.|$|E

5|$|A {{supplementary}} {{member of}} the Storting, he met in the parliament once, acting as secretary for the constitution committee. During 1839–57, he was a {{member of the}} supervisory board of Norges Bank. He became a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in 1821, and was its secretary from 1825 to 1831. Having <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> wish to spread erudition in Norway, he used his acquaintances in England to supply the society with enlightenment books and journals.

5|$|Advances in {{microscopy}} {{also had}} <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, {{a number of}} biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell. In 1838 and 1839, Schleiden and Schwann began promoting the ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of life, though they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks {{to the work of}} Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow, however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what {{came to be known as}} cell theory.|$|E

Outraged at his friend's betrayal, Beilhart ordered Post out of his house and left Battle Creek for Ohio. Louema left Jacob and took the children back to her family in Kansas in 1897.
