5|$|For {{at least}} a portion of its life, <b>a</b> <b>star</b> shines due to {{thermonuclear}} fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space. Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes. Near {{the end of its}} life, <b>a</b> <b>star</b> can also contain degenerate matter. Astronomers can determine the mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other properties of <b>a</b> <b>star</b> by observing its motion through space, its luminosity, and spectrum respectively. The total mass of <b>a</b> <b>star</b> is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate. Other characteristics of <b>a</b> <b>star,</b> including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram). Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.|$|E

5|$|If <b>a</b> <b>star</b> {{displays}} magnetic {{surface activity}} such as starspots, then these features can be tracked {{to estimate the}} rotation rate. However, such features can form at locations other than equator and can migrate across latitudes {{over the course of}} their life span, so differential rotation of <b>a</b> <b>star</b> can produce varying measurements. Stellar magnetic activity is often associated with rapid rotation, so this technique can be used for measurement of such stars. Observation of starspots has shown that these features can actually vary the rotation rate of <b>a</b> <b>star,</b> as the magnetic fields modify the flow of gases in the star.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the first}} of a series of papers on the <b>A</b> <b>stars</b> in open clusters, normal <b>A</b> and Am <b>stars</b> in the Pleiades were {{observed}} with the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope at high spectral resolution and high signal-to-noise ratios. Photospheric abundances have been determined for Li, Al, Si, S, Fe, Ni, and Eu from model atmosphere abundance analysis. The <b>A</b> <b>stars</b> of the Pleiades are at the beginning of their Main Sequence evolution. At this stage, Li is clearly deficient in the Am stars compared with the normal <b>A</b> <b>stars</b> (- 0. 65 dex), and the abundance of Fe is the same for both stellar groups, twice its original solar value as given by the Pleiades F stars. These Fe results are unexpected since, firstly, normal <b>A</b> <b>stars</b> are thought to have normal abundances and, secondly, Am stars are classically said to be overabundant in Fe compared with normal <b>A</b> <b>stars.</b> The maximum Li abundance of the cluster is found in the normal <b>A</b> <b>stars</b> with log N (Li) = 3. 55 ± 0. 1 on the scale log N (H) = 12. 0. These stars seem to have preserved their original Li better than any other cooler stars of the Pleiades cluster. The behavior of Li in the slow-rotator Am stars versus the rapid-rotator normal <b>A</b> <b>stars</b> in the Pleiades is exactly comparable with that found in the ”low v sin i ” versus ”high v sin i ” stars with similar masses in the Orion association. Could it be that Li differentiation between Am and normal <b>A</b> <b>stars</b> takes place during their pre-Main-Sequence evolution? The Li results in the Am stars challenge predictions from model envelopes coupling diffusion and evolution (plus mass loss) in non rotating stars since only strong underabundances are expected at the age of the Pleiades...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We explore to {{what extent}} the study of the {{projected}} rotational velocities of normal <b>A</b> <b>stars</b> might reveal the existence of progenitors of cool Ap stars, i. e. of slowly rotating normal young <b>A</b> <b>stars.</b> Since according to a recent work, magnetic Ap stars with masses ranging from 1. 7 to 2. 5 M ⊙ are never found on the ZAMS in the HR diagram, but have completed at least 30 % of their MS lifetime, one may suspect that some normal young <b>A</b> <b>stars</b> will become Ap later on. Such progenitors are expected to rotate slowly, as is the case of magnetic Ap stars. We show that an unambiguous proof of their existence would require a much larger sample than is available today. A sample of <b>A</b> <b>stars</b> with homogeneous determinations of v sin i and with precise Hipparcos parallaxes is examined. It is shown that no statistically significant difference can be found between the v sin i distributions of young and old stars, and that the data are compatible with conservation of angular momentum in the case of rigid-body rotation. The v sin i distribution of young <b>A</b> <b>stars</b> is compatible with a Maxwellian distribution of equatorial velocities, while this is less so of the older <b>A</b> <b>stars...</b>|$|R

5|$|One {{definition}} of a sub-brown dwarf is a planet-mass object that formed through cloud collapse rather than accretion. This formation distinction between a sub-brown dwarf and a planet is not universally agreed upon; astronomers are divided into two camps as whether to consider the formation process of a planet {{as part of its}} division in classification. One reason for the dissent is that often it may not be possible to determine the formation process. For example, a planet formed by accretion around <b>a</b> <b>star</b> may get ejected from the system to become free-floating, and likewise a sub-brown dwarf that formed on its own in <b>a</b> <b>star</b> cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around <b>a</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E
