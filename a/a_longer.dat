5|$|As {{measured}} on women undergoing in vitro fertilization, <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> menstrual cycle length {{is associated with}} higher pregnancy and delivery rates, even after age adjustment. Delivery rates after IVF have been estimated to be almost doubled for women with a menstrual cycle length of more than 34 days compared with women with a menstrual cycle length shorter than 26 days. <b>A</b> <b>longer</b> menstrual cycle length is also significantly associated with better ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation and embryo quality.|$|E

5|$|The Nclass was {{designed}} by Maunsell in 1914 to provide a sturdy mixed-traffic locomotive with high route availability. Intended to replace several obsolete 0-6-0 types, the Nclass {{was the first step}} in the SECR's fleet standardisation programme, which also included the Kclass 2-6-4T passenger tank locomotive. Maunsell enlisted the help of former GWR engineer Harold Holcroft, who suggested that a 2-6-0 wheel arrangement would allow the class to run on the poor-quality track in north Kent. This arrangement allowed for <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> wheelbase with leading axle to permit greater stability at speed on tight track curves, which had constrained the size of locomotives operating on the SECR. <b>A</b> <b>longer</b> locomotive could also accommodate a larger boiler than an 0-6-0, giving the Nclass sufficient power to avoid double-heading of locomotives on heavier trains.|$|E

5|$|The gingiva {{surrounding}} a tooth has a 2–3mm band of bright pink, very strong attached mucosa, then a darker, larger area of unattached mucosa that folds into the cheeks. When replacing a tooth with an implant, {{a band of}} strong, attached gingiva is {{needed to keep the}} implant healthy in the long-term. This is especially important with implants because the blood supply is more precarious in the gingiva {{surrounding a}}n implant, and is theoretically more susceptible to injury because of <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> attachment to the implant than on a tooth (<b>a</b> <b>longer</b> biologic width).|$|E
