5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingomyelin and gangliosides {{are highly}} {{concentrated in the}} brain and support synaptogenesis and myelination. In the central nervous system, sphingomyelin is a key component of the myelin sheath, which insulates axons and supports efficient transmission of nerve impulses. During myelination, nerve axons are wrapped with multiple layers of cell membrane by oligodendrocyte glial cells, a process that accounts for a large portion of brain growth during late gestation and {{the first two years of}} life, but which can also continue up to 5–10 years of age. Meanwhile, gangliosides are concentrated within the brain’s gray matter and constitute approximately 6% to 10% of the total human brain lipid mass. Additionally, gangliosides are enriched at the synaptic membrane of neurons, and are functionally involved in neurotransmission and synapse formation. Brain ganglioside accretion occurs at an accelerated rate in the early years of life, coinciding with the most <b>active</b> <b>period</b> of myelination, axonal outgrowth, and synaptogenesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{association is}} an incorporated body of volunteers {{who use the}} fort under licence from the Minister. The association operate the fort and visitor centre, holding monthly public open days at which {{the history of the}} fort is recreated; this includes drill demonstrations and firing of the fort's weapons. The association maintain static displays of the fort's <b>active</b> <b>period</b> and sell souvenirs. The association's goal is to have the site open as a fully operational fort for interpretation, tourism and education. The volunteers are involved with recreation, living history and ceremonial work outside the fort. They act as guards of honour at some Government House functions and attended the restoration opening of the Albany, Western Australia fort, and the annual re-enactment of the Battle of Waterloo in Keyneton, Victoria. The fort has living history displays, including the barracks laid out and furnished in period detail. The visitor centre has displays showing the development of South Australia's colonial defence from 1836 and artifacts found on site during restorations.|$|E

25|$|Having {{painted the}} young Princess Victoria (1832–3; destr.; oil sketch, Brit. Royal Col.), Hayter {{was not a}} {{surprising}} choice as the new Queen’s 'Portrait and Historical Painter'. But {{on the death of}} Sir David Wilkie in 1841 Hayter's appointment as Principal Painter in Ordinary to the Queen caused some annoyance at the Royal Academy as this appointment had historically been the preserve of the President, then Sir Martin Archer Shee. In 1842 Hayter was knighted. He painted several royal ceremonies including Queen Victoria’s coronation of 1838 and marriage of 1840 and also the Christening of the Prince of Wales of 1843 (all Brit. Royal Col.). He also painted several royal portraits including his most well known work the State Portrait of the new Queen Victoria. Several versions of this portrait were done, {{with the assistance of the}} artist's son Angelo, to be sent as diplomatic gifts. Hayter's <b>active</b> <b>period</b> at court was short-lived however, because Albert preferred German painters such as F. X. Winterhalter.|$|E

500|$|In China, the {{abundance}} of historical documentary records {{in the form of}} [...] (semiofficial local gazettes) offers an extraordinary opportunity for providing a high-resolution historical dataset for the frequency of typhoon strikes. Kam-biu Liu et al. (2001) reconstructed a 1,000-year time series of typhoon landfalls in the Guangdong Province of southern China since AD 975 and found that on a decadal timescale, the twenty-year interval from AD 1660 to 1680 is the most <b>active</b> <b>period</b> on record, with twenty-eight to thirty-seven typhoon landfalls per decade. The variability in typhoon landfalls in Guangdong mimics that observed in other paleoclimatic proxies (e.g., tree rings, ice cores) from China and the northern hemisphere. Remarkably, the two periods of most frequent typhoon strikes in Guangdong (AD 1660-1680, 1850–1880) coincide with two of the coldest and driest periods in northern and central China during the Little Ice Age.|$|E

Cædmon {{is said to}} have taken holy orders at an advanced age and it is implied that he lived at Streonæshalch at least in part during Hilda's abbacy (657680). Book IV Chapter 25 of the Historia ecclesiastica appears to suggest that Cædmon's death occurred {{at about the same time}} as the fire at Coldingham Abbey, an event dated in the E text of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to 679, but after 681 by Bede. [...] The reference to his temporibus [...] "at this time" [...] in the opening lines of Chapter 25 may refer more generally to Cædmon's career as a poet. However, the next datable event in the Historia ecclesiastica is King Ecgfrith's raid on Ireland in 684 (Book IV, Chapter 26). Taken together, this evidence suggests an <b>active</b> <b>period</b> beginning between 657 and 680 and ending between 679 and 684.|$|E
500|$|Fifteen {{depressions}} {{developed during}} the 1960 season, with five becoming cyclonic storms. The majority of the activity {{took place in the}} Bay of Bengal, where eleven systems formed; however, the season's first storm formed over the Arabian Sea on May10. The storm produced hurricane-force winds and attained a barometric air pressure of 974mbar (hPa; 28.77inHg). The deadliest and most intense cyclone of the season was Severe Cyclonic Storm Ten, which killed 14,174 in East Pakistan in early November. With peak winds estimated at 150km/h (90mph) and a pressure of 966.7mbar (hPa; 28.55inHg), it struck just three weeks after the previous system devastated the same area. The storm produced a [...] storm tide that swept 16km (10mi) inland, submerging several small islands. The two storms left a combined 200,000300,000people homeless. These systems marked the start of an unusually <b>active</b> <b>period</b> of cyclones impacting East Pakistan, culminating ten years later with the 1970 Bhola cyclone, which killed between 300,000 and 500,000people. During the 1960 season, several depressions impacted India with heavy rainfall. Collectively, these systems killed 167people.|$|E
500|$|Basset is {{recorded}} in the Pipe Roll of 1130 as having performed judicial functions in 11 different shires, even though by this point he was already dead. Basset also served on the informal vice-regency council that assisted Henry's wife and son when the king was out of England. Basset seems to have {{spent most of his}} judicial and royal career in England, as he only is a witness on one royal document that was drawn up in Normandy. According to the compiler of the Basset family charters, William Reedy, [...] "there is more evidence for Ralph's service for the king in England" [...] than for any other royal servant who was not clergy. His most <b>active</b> <b>period</b> of royal service was from 1120 to 1130. An older view from historians was that Basset was Chief Justiciar of England is not held by historians currently, nor can the idea that Basset was the head of justices or just the head of the itinerant justices during Henry's reign cannot be determined with any confidence either. It is clear that Basset was employed by the king extensively and probably that the nobleman worked mostly full-time for the king.|$|E

Therefore, a quantitative evaluation of behavioral dynamics {{could contribute to}} objective diagnoses of schizophrenia. However, such an approach has not been fully established because {{of the absence of}} quantitative biobehavioral measures. Recently, we studied the dynamical properties of locomotor activity, specifically how resting and <b>active</b> <b>periods</b> are interwoven in daily life. We discovered universal statistical laws ("behavioral organization") and their alterations in patients with major depressive disorder. In this study, we evaluated behavioral organization of schizophrenic patients (n =  19) and healthy subjects (n =  11) using locomotor activity data, acquired by actigraphy, to investigate whether the laws could provide objective and quantitative measures for a possible diagnosis and assessment of symptoms. Specifically, we evaluated the cumulative distributions of resting and <b>active</b> <b>periods,</b> defined as the periods with physical activity counts successively below and above a predefined threshold, respectively. Here we report alterations in the laws governing resting and <b>active</b> periods; resting <b>periods</b> obeyed a power-law cumulative distribution with significantly lower parameter values (power-law scaling exponents), whereas <b>active</b> <b>periods</b> followed a stretched exponential distribution with significantly lower parameter values (stretching exponents), in patients.
