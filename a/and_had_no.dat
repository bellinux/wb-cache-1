5|$|Benn's {{father had}} been created Viscount Stansgate in 1942 when Winston Churchill {{increased}} the number of Labour peers to aid political work in the House of Lords; at this time, Benn's elder brother Michael was intending to enter the priesthood <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> objections to inheriting a peerage.

5|$|Bizet's {{marriage}} to Geneviève Halévy was intermittently happy and produced one son. After his death, his work, apart from Carmen, was generally neglected.

He founded no school <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> obvious disciples or successors. After years of neglect, his works began to be performed more frequently in the 20th century. Later commentators have acclaimed him as a composer of brilliance and originality whose premature death was a significant loss to French musical theatre.|$|E

5|$|Color Air {{had only}} one seating class, offered no {{on-board}} beverages <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> frequent flyer program or lounges. Color Air had an agreement for tickets to be sold at the Rimi supermarkets, {{as well as by}} phone and Internet. If bought at a travel agency, there was a NOK 200 surcharge. This was because Color Air was not linked to the Amadeus booking system, owing to the costs associated with membership.|$|E

South Australia's Charlie Walker was also talked of as a possible Test player.|$|E
5|$|Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro were {{nominated}} {{again at the}} 2007 Martín Fierro Awards.

5|$|In 2013, Corzine, and {{managers}} including Bradley Abelow and Henri Steenkamp, appealed a court ruling relating to repayments to customers of the bankrupt brokerage. A spokesman for Mr. Corzine {{made clear that}} the appeal was not an attempt to delay payments to customers, but due to a disagreement regarding how those claims would be handled by the trustee after they were paid. Mr. Corzine fully supported customers receiving 100 percent of their money <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> desire for this to be delayed. There was nothing preventing the trustee from making full distributions immediately and litigating the appeal after the fact. Ultimately all customers were paid in full.|$|E
