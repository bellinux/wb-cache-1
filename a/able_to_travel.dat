5|$|By 1872, the {{railroad}} had extended from Portland to Roseburg. Along the way, it created growth in Willamette Valley {{towns such as}} Canby, Aurora, and Harrisburg, which emerged as freight and passenger stations, and provided a commercial lifeline to {{the part of the}} river valley above Harrisburg where steamships were rarely <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel.</b> As {{the railroad}} made its way into the Umpqua Valley, new townsites such as Drain, Oakland, and Yoncalla were laid out.|$|E
5|$|The {{handcart}} companies {{continued with}} more success until 1860, and traditional ox-and-wagon companies also continued {{for those who}} could afford the higher cost. After 1860, the church began sending wagon companies east each spring, to return to Utah in the summer with the emigrating Latter-day Saints. Finally, with {{the completion of the}} Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, future emigrants were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> by rail, and the era of the Mormon pioneer trail came to an end.|$|E

5|$|After {{five hours}} of fighting, the troops subdued the Comanche resistance. Buffalo Hump escaped, but 70 Comanches were killed or mortally wounded, only two of them noncombatants. Ross's {{injuries}} were severe, and for five days he lay under a tree on the battlefield, unable to be moved. His wounds became infected, and Ross begged the others to kill him to end his pain. When he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel,</b> he was first carried on a litter suspended between two mules, {{and then on the}} shoulders of his men. He recovered fully, but experienced some pain for {{much of the rest of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from overseas in 1921, Cooper {{got a job}} working the night shift at The New York Times. He was commissioned to write articles for Asia magazine. Cooper was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> with Ernest Schoedsack on a sea voyage on the Wisdom II. As part of the journey, he traveled to Abyssinia, or the Ethiopian Empire, where he met their prince regent, Ras Tefari, later known as Emperor Haile Selassie I. The ship left Abyssinia in February 1923. On their way home, the crew narrowly missed being attacked by pirates, and the ship was burned down. His three-part series for Asia was published in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Although {{late and}} over-budget the {{decision}} to cancel the MRA4 was controversial as the remaining airframes had all been near completion. It {{has been reported that}} following the retirement of the Nimrod MR2 (in March 2010.), Russian submarines have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> past the UK in international waters, but they could not be tracked {{because of the lack of}} suitable aircraft. In November and early December 2014 four maritime patrol aircraft operated by France, Canada and the United States were based at RAF Lossiemouth to attempt to locate a Russian submarine which had been spotted in British territorial waters off west Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Fleetwood {{continued}} to grow without its principal investor, albeit slowly. As a port, it soon faced competition from Lytham and Preston. In 1847 Queen Victoria and Prince Albert travelled through Fleetwood {{on their way to}} London from Scotland, but that year saw the decline of the town's importance on the route to Scotland. More powerful locomotives were now <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> over hilly terrain, and the railway was extended over Shap Fell all the way to Scotland; Fleetwood was no longer needed as a sea link.|$|E
5|$|In fact, Squall and {{the heroes}} do help Ultimecia start Time Compression, {{but they do}} so to confront her in her own time. After Squall and his party defeat Sorceress Adel, Adel {{transfers}} her power to Rinoa, then Ultimecia possesses Rinoa again, and Ellone uses her power to send their consciousness to the past, at which point Ultimecia starts Time Compression. At that moment, the heroes are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> to Ultimecia's distant future and defeat her. After the final battle, the defeated Ultimecia transfers her powers to Edea.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two albums Valérian travels through time in a {{two-seater}} device, the XB27, which transports him to the various relay stations that Galaxity has hidden throughout time (e.g. in Bad Dreams (Les Mauvais Rêves) the relay is hidden below a tavern). In subsequent stories Valérian and Laureline use the saucer-shaped Astroship XB982 (which made its debut appearance in 1969 in the short story The Great Collector (Le Grand Collectionneur). The astroship is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> anywhere using a spatio-temporal jump, a sort of hyperspace drive enabling near-instant transportation anywhere in space and time.|$|E

5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> here.|$|E
5|$|Neorealism ("The {{world is}} made of {{ordinary}} objects.") Constructed by David Bohm and also associated with Louis de Broglie, this interpretation holds that quantum objects possess definite attributes, but that these attributes can change value instantly in response to events anywhere in the universe, with this information encoded in a physical pilot wave which must be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> faster than light. Other physicists attempted to construct object-based models which did away with this superluminal communication, but Bell's theorem later proved this to be impossible. For this reason, according to Herbert, neorealism is rejected {{by most of the}} physics establishment.|$|E
5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is when gas or air is in {{the layer}} under the skin. Subcutaneous refers to the tissue beneath the skin, and emphysema refers to trapped air. It is sometimes abbreviated SCE or SE and also called tissue emphysema, or Sub Q air. Since the air generally comes from the chest cavity, subcutaneous emphysema usually occurs on the chest, neck and face, where it is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> from the chest cavity along the fascia. Subcutaneous emphysema has a characteristic crackling feel to the touch, a sensation that {{has been described as}} similar to touching Rice Krispies; this sensation of air under the skin is known as subcutaneous crepitation.|$|E

5|$|The Panhandles {{played their}} only home game at Neil Park. Joseph Carr made the team play mostly away games {{because they were}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> on the railroads for free. This cut down on stadium cost and saved the team money. The regular season {{schedule}} was not a fixed schedule but was created dynamically by each team as the season progressed. Over {{the course of the}} 1920 season, the Panhandles played a total of 11 games. Of those 11 games, five were against APFA teams, and the others were against non-APFA teams. Every game played against league teams resulted in a loss.|$|E
5|$|The mafic shield-building stage {{began with}} the {{eruption}} of thin mafic lava flows on an eroded surface. Successive eruptions sent lava pouring in all directions from central vents, forming a broad, gently sloping volcano of flat, domical shape, with a profile much {{like that of a}} warrior's shield. Alkali basalts and ankaramites were the primary lavas produced during this stage of activity which, due to their low silica content, were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> great distances away from their source. These lavas also erupted from vents on the flanks of the volcano. Blocky 'a'a and ropy pāhoehoe flows characterized the fluid and effusive nature of volcanism at Level Mountain during the mafic shield-building stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} the story stress that time cannot be changed through {{traveller}} actions as per the Novikov self-consistency principle; Paul Serene gives an example of trying to save a dead vagrant he and Jack discovered in their youth, only to startle the vagrant and cause the fall that killed him when he goes back in time. Another enforced rule is that travelers can only move between machines located at different times using the same core: as such, {{it is impossible for}} the characters to travel back before the first power-up of the core, nor would they be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> between different time machines as the cores would be different. The game features narration from Jack himself.|$|E

50|$|Rabbi Lipkin {{was unique}} and his views {{were not always}} in the mainstream. He was careful to always comply with the law, even where this was discriminatory against Jews. For example, in order <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> legally <b>travel</b> outside of the Pale of Settlement, he became a master dye-maker. This enabled him to receive a permit {{allowing}} free travel within Russia.|$|R
5|$|After McDougall {{was unable}} to persuade {{existing}} shipbuilders to try his designs, he founded the American Steel Barge Company in Superior, Wisconsin in 1888, and built them himself. McDougall actively promoted his design and company by sending the SS Charles W. Wetmore to London, and starting another shipyard in Everett, Washington, which built the SS City of Everett. When the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, {{to be held in}} Chicago, Illinois, was in the planning stages, McDougall recognized another opportunity to publicize his design. The Columbus, conceived as an elaborate ferry, was intended to demonstrate that the whaleback design would work well in passenger service, and would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> at high speed. The ship's name honored the explorer Christopher Columbus as did the World's Columbian Exposition itself, timed to coincide with the 400th anniversary of his first voyage to the New World.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, {{developments}} in chemotherapy offered some hope for Ruth. The doctors {{had not told}} Ruth that he had cancer because of his family's fear that he might do himself harm. They treated him with teropterin, a folic acid derivative; {{he may have been}} the first human subject. Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that his case was presented by his doctors at a scientific meeting, without using his name. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on American Legion Baseball. He appeared again at another day in his honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough to pitch in an old-timers game as he had hoped.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is a {{freshwater}} {{species and}} {{is found in}} forested riverine habitats and areas of flooded forest around lakes. It seems to prefer rivers and streams with fast-flowing water, {{but it is also}} found in quiet, nutrient-poor waters in Venezuela and southeastern Brazil. It is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> quite large distances overland at night and sub-adult individuals have sometimes been found in isolated, temporary pools. In the northern and southern parts of its range, it is also found in gallery forests in savannah country, but it is absent from such habitats in Los Llanos and the Pantanal. Cuvier's dwarf caiman seems relatively tolerant of cool water compared to other species of alligator. During the day, individuals sometimes lie up in burrows but at other times rest on piles of rocks or sun themselves while lying, facing the sun, in shallow water with their backs exposed.|$|E
