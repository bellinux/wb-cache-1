5|$|In {{the last}} game of the season, Michigan hosted their archrivals the No. 9 nationally ranked Ohio State Buckeyes, in the 106th meeting between the two teams. Ohio State scored first when Michigan QB Forcier fumbled while {{scrambling}} in the end zone; the ball was recovered by Ohio State's Cameron Heyward for <b>a</b> <b>TD.</b> Michigan's only score {{of the first half}} was a 46-yard field goal. Ohio State's Brandon Saine ran in a 29-yard TD late in the second quarter to make it 14–3 at halftime.|$|E

The Sooners' QB Paul Thompson went 11 for 19 with two touchdowns and no interceptions. He also ran for 28yards and a score while Allen Patrick added 162yards on 36carries.

30|$|Consider again {{multihop}} topology of Figure 2 a. Three-node-disjoint and link-disjoint paths (P <b>a</b> <b>t</b> h 1 (l 1, l 2,l 3,l 4), P <b>a</b> <b>t</b> h 2 (l 5,l 6,l 7) and P <b>a</b> <b>t</b> h 3 (l 8,l 9,l 10)) {{are available}} for flow f 1 (s 1,d 1). A single-hop flow f 2 (s 2,d 2) operating under saturated traffic load is creating interference on links of P <b>a</b> <b>t</b> h 2 and P <b>a</b> <b>t</b> h 3 of flow f 1. Figure 2 c shows aggregate throughput of flow f 1 when different subsets of paths are selected for routing. It is obvious that not all pairs of paths lead to the same throughput. The throughput is significantly lower when P <b>a</b> <b>t</b> h 2 and (or) P <b>a</b> <b>t</b> h 3 is chosen. This is because link l 9 of P <b>a</b> <b>t</b> h 3 is experiencing non-coordinated interference from flow f 2. Similarly, link l 5 of P <b>a</b> <b>t</b> h 2 is experiencing non-coordinated interference from link l 9. Consequently, a chain {{similar to that of}} Figure 1 a is formed, resulting in a bottleneck link on P <b>a</b> <b>t</b> h 3. Therefore, ignoring l 9 during link selection phase of path construction procedure can eliminate the chain. This helps in improving effective capacity of l 5, causing P <b>a</b> <b>t</b> h 2 to offer more flow capacity to flow f 1. Note that link pair l 4,l 1 is also non-coordinated pairs; however, this pair belongs to same path and none of the links operates in saturated mode. Therefore, the impact of interference in minimized, resulting in significant opportunities for link l 1.|$|R
