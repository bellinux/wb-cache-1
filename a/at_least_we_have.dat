6000|$|... "It {{has been}} terrible," [...] Julian agreed, [...] "but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the {{satisfaction}} of knowing that Ney's corps d'armée has furnished a smaller share of stragglers {{than most of the}} others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, nay," [...] he answered; [...] "live {{on while}} you may; for who knows? Often {{out of the}} worst comes the best. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> had our joy. Swear it now, sweet." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{meal was}} not yet {{prepared}} when Simon Kenton appeared, and I was rejoiced to see him greet the hunters {{as if they had}} been old friends, for it told that during this night <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> nothing to fear.|$|R

6000|$|... "If you {{had taken}} my advice," [...] {{said one of}} the other boys, [...] "we should have eaten some of the nuts. Those, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> been sure of." ...|$|R
60|$|The French Colonial {{system has}} usually been excellent, and there is, therefore, {{every reason to}} believe that this one result of evil example will soon be amended. There, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no Treaty {{obligation}} to interfere.|$|E
6000|$|For no {{apparent}} reason Maud Barrington evaded her aunt's gaze. [...] "You," [...] she said dryly, [...] "have forgiven one of that type a good deal already, but, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> never seen him when the fit was upon him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is the key, Carlo," [...] she said, {{showing him}} one of a massive bunch, [...] "and I am now the sole warder. This much, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> effected; the day may still come when we shall do more." ...|$|E
60|$|I fixed my glance on {{him long}} and dubiously. What ought I to do next? As for Sebastian, he lay {{with his eyes}} closed, half {{oblivious}} of my presence. The fever had gripped him hard. He shivered, and looked helpless as a child. In such circumstances, the instincts of my profession rose imperative within me. I could not nurse a case properly in this wretched hut. The {{one thing to be}} done was to carry the patient down to our camp in the valley. There, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> air and pure running water.|$|R
60|$|Even {{that day}} {{came to an}} end at last, and after a few more lumps of yak, our tent being gone, we drew his hide over us and rested as best we could, knowing that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> no more {{avalanches}} to fear. That night it froze sharply, so that {{had it not been for}} the yak's hide and the other rugs and garments, which fortunately we were wearing when the snow-slide began, it would, I think, have gone hard with us. As it was, we suffered a great deal.|$|R
6000|$|... "It must be owned," [...] {{another of}} the group said, [...] "that these wolves bite hard. I was in Paris last year, with the Count de Caussac. Well, we laughed {{when we saw the}} three parties of white wolves ride out from Saint Denis; but I tell you, there was no {{laughing}} when they got among us. We were in the Constable's troop; and though, as far as I know, we were all pretty stout men-at-arms, and were four to one against them <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> little to boast of when the fight was over.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tut, tut, we {{have solved}} some worse problems. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> plenty of material, {{if we can}} only use it. Come, then, and, having {{exhausted}} the Palmer, let us see what the Dunlop with the patched cover has to offer us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whatever say priests or controversialists," [...] murmured M. Emanuel, [...] "God is good, {{and loves}} all the sincere. Believe, then, what you can; believe {{it as you}} can; one prayer, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> in common; I also cry--'O Dieu, sois appaisé envers moi qui suis pécheur!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it is not," [...] {{the girl}} {{reminded}} him, and then: [...] "Let us {{make the best}} of it. We have escaped from death for a time <b>at</b> <b>least.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> food and good water and peace and each other. What more could we have upon the mainland?" ...|$|E

60|$|Then {{we went on}} {{as quickly}} as we could, which was not very fast, for I feared lest the Basutos should change their minds and follow us. As the risk of this became less our spirits rose, since if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> lost the wagon and the oxen, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> saved our lives, which was almost more than <b>we</b> could <b>have</b> {{expected}} in the circumstances. At last we came to that glade where <b>we</b> <b>had</b> killed the wildebeeste not a week before. There lay its skeleton picked clean by the great brown kites that frequent the bush-veld, some of which still sat about in the trees.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{may well}} be so," [...] he said sadly, [...] "but I pray {{that it is not}} so, for she is the best of chieftainesses. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> our own lives to save, so let us go on," [...] and again they pressed forward through the {{gathering}} gloom.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can I not soften {{you in any}} way?" [...] he cried. [...] "Ah, see--see here"--he {{produced}} a small Grecian cross from inside his velvet jacket. [...] "Look at this. Our religions may differ in form, but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> some common thoughts and feelings when we see this emblem." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop, {{my young}} namesake," [...] he eagerly cried, {{when he found}} that the sailor was about to make an effort to drag his own body up the cliff; [...] "stop; that will never do; let Dutton and me do that much for you, <b>at</b> <b>least.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> seen all that has passed, and are now able to do something." ...|$|E
60|$|How <b>had</b> <b>we</b> {{lived through}} such a journey? The answer seemed to be, after we were too weak to find or take food, {{by means of the}} drug that Kari {{cherished}} in his skin bag, and water of which there was plenty left at hand in barrels, since the Blanche had been provisioned for a long voyage to Italy and farther. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> lived for weeks, and weeks, being still young and very strong, and not having been called upon to suffer great cold, since it would appear that although the gale continued after {{the first few days of}} our flight before it, the weather had turned warm.|$|R
5000|$|Minkowski's bound {{may be used}} {{to derive}} a lower bound for the {{discriminant}} of a field K given n, r1 and r2. Since an integral ideal <b>has</b> norm <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> 1 ≤ MK, so that ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If my luck but holds until Wednesday next," [...] he concluded, [...] "you may count upon {{being well}} out of Condillac. Arsenio does not dream that you come with us, so that even should he change his mind, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no cause to fear a betrayal. But he will not change his mind. The {{prospect}} of fifty pistoles has rendered it immutable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must think}} hardly of us, Mr. Osbaldistone, {{and it is}} not natural that it should be otherwise. But remember, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not been unprovoked. We are a rude and an ignorant, and it may be a violent and passionate, but we are not a cruel people. The land might be at peace and in law for us, did they allow us to enjoy the blessings of {{peaceful}} law. But we have been a persecuted generation." ...|$|E
60|$|Mind you, it is {{the same}} in all the other villages, and in every town in Hungary--so <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been given to understand--but we {{have nothing to do with}} other villages or with the towns: they do just as the good God wills them to do. It is our lads--the lads of Marosfalva and Kender and Fekete and Görcz--who have to be packed off in train-loads to-day and taken away from us for three years.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{must take}} the risk, husband. There are still true hearts in Anahuac, who will stand by us in our sorrow and their own. <b>At</b> the <b>least</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> escaped from greater dangers. Now let me dress your wounds and rest awhile.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The boycott (which {{lasted until}} the {{entrance}} of the United States into World War II) did nothing to stop the harassment of Jews in Germany.

I shall always know that hare again by the white marks on its back; also it is the biggest I have seen for a long while. Come on, my friends, the dog is dead and there's an end of it. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> had a good morning's sport, so let's go to the Hall and get some lunch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] he said, [...] "we {{have nothing}} like this, {{but in the}} north, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> odd bits of rugged {{grandeur}} where the wildness of the hills about one is emphasized by the green fertility of the valleys.

60|$|<b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{the strongest}} {{presumption}} from analogy {{that the idea}} is correct, for do we not find lions and tigers, apes and gorillas, engaged in lovingly licking--we don't mean whipping--and otherwise fondling their offspring? Even in Hades we find the lost rich man praying for the deliverance of his brethren from torment, and that, surely, was love {{in the form of}} pity. At all events, whatever name we may give it, {{there can be no doubt}} it was unselfish. And even selfishness is love misapplied.|$|E
50|$|His death date is uncertain. Some date it {{as early}} as 1485, and one {{authority}} has 1482, although historian Peter Russell suggests he lived until <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 1499. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> confirmation he was certainly dead by 1502, from the record of an indulgence for his soul paid for by his widow.|$|R
6000|$|... "A good saying," [...] {{answered}} Wulf. [...] "I am {{weary of}} doubts and troublings. Let us follow our uncle's will, and visit this Old Man of the Mountains, to do which I think the widow Masouda {{is the woman}} to help us.

60|$|I saw a Selenite {{running in}} front of me, his legs going exactly as a man's would go on earth, saw him glance over his shoulder, and heard him shriek as he ran aside {{out of my way}} into the darkness. He was, I think, our guide, but I am not sure. Then in another vast stride the walls of rock had come into view on either hand, and in two more strides I was in the tunnel, and {{tempering}} my pace to its low roof. I went on to a bend, then stopped and turned back, and plug, plug, plug, Cavor came into view, splashing into the stream of blue light at every stride, and grew larger and blundered into me. We stood clutching each other. For a moment, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> shaken off our captors and were alone.|$|R
