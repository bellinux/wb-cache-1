This {{was the first major}} presidential debate in which Keyes participated during the 2008 election season and the last Republican debate before the Iowa Caucuses. Although Keyes was not listed on the latest national CNN poll leading up to the debate, he registered with at least 1 percent of the Iowa vote in order to participate. During the debate, after the moderator began to ask a question of Texas Congressman Ron Paul, Keyes insisted he was not getting fair treatment. He interrupted the debate moderator at one point, saying that she had not called on him in several rounds and that he had to make an issue of it. He went on the offensive against his opponents during the debate, criticizing Rudy Giuliani's pro-choice position, as well as Mitt Romney's recent change in position on the same subject. In answering a question about global warming, he continued his criticisms of other candidates, saying, [...] "I'm in favor of reducing global warming, because I think the most important emission we need to control is the hot <b>air</b> <b>emission</b> of politicians who pretend one thing and don't deliver". He also advocated ending the income tax, establishing state-sanctioned prayer in public schools, and abolishing abortion. Toward the end of the debate, Keyes stated he could not support Giuliani if he were to win the nomination due to the former New York mayor's position on abortion.|$|E

40|$|Today {{one of the}} {{emerging}} issues in aviation is the assessment, control and reduction of <b>air</b> <b>emissions.</b> In particular airports are increasingly scrutinized for accountability of <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> contributions to the local and regional air quality.

40|$|The {{monitoring}} of air quality to develop meaningful air programs and policies {{has been an}} on-going initiative {{in the province of}} Ontario, Canada. Ontario has been monitoring and reporting on air quality throughout the province since the 1970 s. In 1993 the Ontario Ministry of the Environment (MOE) embarked on its first effort to inventory Ontario’s point source emissions {{through the use of a}} voluntary survey. This survey was distributed annually to industrial facilities throughout the province, requesting annual activity data for the estimation of Ontario facility <b>air</b> <b>emissions.</b> This exercise consistently yielded a low response from Ontario point sources. In January of 2000, the MOE proposed an air quality initiative that would consist of a regulation requiring the mandatory monitoring and reporting of <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> from point sources. This proposal became reality when Ontario Regulation 227 (O. Reg. 227 / 00 - "Electricity Generation- Monitoring and Reporting") came into effect in May of 2000. This regulation applied to certain Ontario electricity generation facilities and regulated 28 airborne contaminants. The goal of a regulated <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> inventory program applicable to a wide spectrum facilities was realized when the MOE promulgated Ontario Regulation 127 (O. Reg. 127 / 01) regulating <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> from industrial, commercial, institutional, and municipal point sources in the province. Facilities are able to report their <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> under O. Reg. 127 / 01 via the MOE’s web-based reporting and registration site titled “OnAIR”. This study will chronicle the evolution of <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> inventories in the province of Ontario, describing the progression from voluntary to mandatory point source <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> reporting, provide observations of the <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> reports submitted by Ontario point sources, and discuss the future direction of <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> reporting in the province...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper conducts Granger-causality {{tests on}} real per capita GDP and {{four types of}} <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> (CO 2, CO, SO 2 and NOx) by using Norwegian data {{covering}} the period 1973 - 2003. The test results indicate that only unidirectional causal relationships exist between GDP and <b>air</b> <b>emissions.</b> For CO 2 and CO, we find long run causal relationships running from GDP to emissions, whereas for SO 2 and NOx, only the short run causal relationships are found from emissions to GDP. Therefore, {{as far as the}} four types of <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> in Norway are concerned, the presumption, employed in the conventional EKC analyses that the causal relationship between emissions and GDP is unidirectional from the latter to the former, may be retained for CO 2 and CO only.

40|$|Advanced {{petroleum}} {{and natural}} gas production technologies are increasingly used to help meet the demand for energy in both the United States and globally. As conventional resources become more scarce, research and innovation by {{the oil and gas}} industry has resulted in techniques for tapping unconventional resources, including hydrocarbons trapped in shale formations found in a number of locations throughout the United States. A key technology for accessing such resources is hydraulic fracturing (fracking), which has transformed natural gas production over the past several years and is also being applied for oil production. These new energy supply technologies also bring new environmental management challenges. Among the issues of concern are the <b>air</b> pollution <b>emissions</b> from fracking operations and whether they can potentially impact air quality at well sites and in surrounding communities. A significant opportunity exists to improve the sustainability of energy production by reducing the <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> from fracking operations. This Master’s Project focuses on the characterization and modeling of these <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> to help improve environmental management efforts by the industry and to inform the application of regulations for guiding efforts to reduce emissions. The emissions addressed include criteria air pollutants and their precursors. The work involved identifying major sources of emissions during fracking operations, evaluating current models used for <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> characterization, and developing refinements to the models to enable better emissions management. The project team travelled to a well site and to testing facilities to learn about operations in two different shale formations and to gather data needed to improve emissions characterization. These visits enabled the team to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of fracking equipment, operations and <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> test protocols. The project results include an improved characterization of <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> from equipment used in fracking, specifically for the high-power diesel frac pumps that were found to be responsible for the largest portion of emissions. The project also developed recommendations for improving the existing <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> models for purposes of regulatory reporting and compliance, and also for potential ways to decrease <b>air</b> <b>emissions</b> from fracking operations...|$|R
