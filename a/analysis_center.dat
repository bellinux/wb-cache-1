The accuracy evaluated by satellite laser ranging residuals is on the one decimeter level with a systematic bias of about − 5 cm for all <b>analysis</b> <b>centers.</b> In addition, systematic errors on the decimeter level related to solar radiation pressure mismodeling are present in all orbit products. Due to the correlation of radial orbit errors with the clock parameters, these errors are also visible as a bump in the Allan deviation of the Galileo satellite clocks at the orbital frequency...|$|R

We first present some general background related to the DORIS system (current and planned satellites, current tracking network and expected evolution) and to the general IDS organization (from Data <b>Centers,</b> <b>Analysis</b> <b>Centers</b> and Combination Center).

The DORIS contribution to ITRF 2013 should also benefit from the larger number of ground observations collected by the last generation of DGXX receivers (first instrument being onboard Jason- 2 satellite). In particular for polar motion, sub-millarcsecond accuracy seems now to be achievable.
