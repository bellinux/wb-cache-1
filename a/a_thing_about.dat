25|$|Hayasaka was {{recruited}} into adult video by a scout and her debut AV, Hito-Mi-X {{was released on}} the Max-A Calen label in July 2001 just after her 19th birthday. In an interview a year later {{she said she did}} not know what she was doing in her first tape and did not remember <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> it. Her second video, also for Max-A, was Don't Close Your Eyes and Hayasaka said that it was particularly hard for her, bringing her to tears, because she had little experience with adult toys. Hayasaka was acknowledged by fans for her work in her debut year by being named Best New Actress at the 2001 X City Grand Prix Awards held in December 2001.|$|E
500|$|Sheraton Kalouria, {{senior vice}} {{president}} of NBC's daytime programming, said that the show's racially diverse ensemble, as represented by the African American Russells and the Hispanic Lopez-Fitzgeralds, exemplified [...] "truly color-blind storytelling". Ross believed that Eve was not defined by identity as an African American: [...] "If they wanted to make my character any other ethnicity they wouldn't have to change <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> her... She's just a person." [...] The actress cited the show's racial diversity as a primary reason for her attraction to the role. She stated that she felt [...] "tremendous support from NBC and Passions that the black characters and/or Hispanic characters are all essential parts of the story". She has cited Eve as helping to expand the TV representation of African Americans and interracial relationships.|$|E

500|$|U.S. Department of State {{spokesman}} Nicholas Burns {{rejected the}} Nazi comparisons {{in the open}} letter as [...] "outrageous" [...] and distanced the U.S. government from Nazi comparisons made by the Church of Scientology, saying, [...] "We have criticized the Germans on this, but we aren't going to support the Scientologists' terror tactics against the German government." [...] Chancellor Kohl, commenting on the letter, said that those who signed it [...] "don't know <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> Germany and don't want to know." [...] German officials argued that [...] "the whole fuss was cranked up by the Scientologists to achieve what we won't give them: tax-exempt status as a religion. This is intimidation, pure and simple." [...] Officials explained that precisely because of Germany's Nazi past, Germany took a determined stance against all [...] "radical cults and sects, including right-wing Nazi groups", and not just against Scientology. Kohl's Christian Democratic Union party denounced the letter as [...] "absurd" [...] and cited German court rulings stating that Scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a [...] "contemptuous cartel of oppression".|$|E
500|$|Brady {{admitted}} under police questioning {{that he and}} Evans had fought, but {{insisted that}} he and Smith had murdered Evans between them; Hindley, he said, had [...] "only done {{what she had been}} told". Smith told police that Brady had asked him to return anything incriminating, such as [...] "dodgy books", which Brady then packed into suitcases. Smith had no idea what else the suitcases contained or where they might be, but he mentioned in passing that Brady [...] "had <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> railway stations". The police consequently requested a search of all Manchester's left-luggage offices for any suitcases belonging to Brady, and on 15 October British Transport Police found {{what they were looking for}} at Manchester Central railway station—the left-luggage ticket was found several days later in the back of Hindley's prayer book. Inside one of the suitcases were nine pornographic photographs taken of a young girl, naked and with a scarf tied across her mouth, and a 13-minute tape recording of her screaming and pleading for help. Ann Downey, Lesley Ann Downey's mother, later listened to the tape after police had discovered the body of her missing 10-year-old daughter, and confirmed that it was a recording of her daughter's voice.|$|E
500|$|Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote, [...] "Beyoncé may {{not know}} <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> algebra, {{but when it comes}} to the math of power ballads, she totally gets it." [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "the album [...] opens with its most tender ballad, a slow-burning number that calls back to both Sam Cooke's 'Wonderful World' and Prince's 'Purple Rain' without {{sounding}} like a retread of either tune [...] it sounds best in the context of the album, where its slow, steady build to a cathartic guitar break is the perfect introduction to a set of mostly low-key tracks about love and heartbreak." [...] Similarly considering [...] "1+1" [...] to be [...] "the perfect opener" [...] of 4, Joanne Dorken of MTV UK wrote that it exposes a more vulnerable side of Beyoncé and that it will remain [...] "a classic stripped-back slow jam from the diva." [...] Praising Beyoncé's vocals, Jon Caramainca of The New York Times stated that [...] " [...] requires a vocal muscle few singers possess, and even fewer would care to deploy." [...] Writing for The Baltimore Sun, Wesley Case included [...] "1+1" [...] in his list of Five Great Songs and praised song's concept, writing that he began crying when he heard the album version and called it [...] "gut-wrenching" [...] and [...] "gorgeous". Case appreciated Beyoncé's sensitivity and concluded that it [...] "fades to black like an ellipsis and it's so damn beautiful." ...|$|E

Actress Patsy Kelly confirmed she had {{a sexual relationship with}} Bankhead when she worked for her as a personal assistant. John Gruen's Menotti: A Biography notes an incident in which Jane Bowles chased Bankhead around Capricorn, Gian Carlo Menotti and Samuel Barber's Mount Kisco estate, insisting that Bankhead needed to play the lesbian character Inès in Jean-Paul Sartre's No Exit (which Paul Bowles had recently translated). Bankhead locked herself in the bathroom and kept insisting, [...] "That lesbian! I wouldn't know <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kevin O'Sullivan {{from the}} Daily Mirror called the affair storyline [...] "dreadful", [...] "painfully unoriginal", [...] "ludicrous tosh" [...] and [...] "far fetched", saying, [...] "A tired old rerun of 2010's who-got-Heather-pregnant nailbiter, the who-copped-off-with-Kat saga {{was about as}} {{believable}} as a Barclays banker." [...] Ally Ross from The Sun said that [...] "someone has been slipping angel dust in the Queen Vic beer and half the Square have lost their friggin' minds [...] all the men now fancy Ting Tong (Kat Moon)", while Julie Emery from Heat said, [...] "Now don't get us wrong, we love Kat Moon. [...] But we're finding {{it hard to believe}} that she has five (five!) blokes thinking she's sex-on-legs and lusting after her Tango'd torso. Perhaps Michael, Ray, Jack, Max and Derek all have <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> too-tight Lycra pencil skirts and make-up that looks like it's been applied by a five year old on acid." [...] Sarah Dempster from The Guardian dubbed the storyline [...] "Who Banged Kat?", [...] "a question to which the only sane response is 'Pass us the remote, love. [...] is on Five.'"
