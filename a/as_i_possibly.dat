500|$|Savides' first {{experience}} with the Viper Filmstream camera was shooting a Motorola commercial with Fincher. From there, he used it on Zodiac. Fincher {{wanted to make sure}} that the camera was more inclined towards film production so that the studio would be more comfortable about using it on a project with a large budget. To familiarize himself with the camera, he [...] "did as many things 'wrong' <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>possibly</b> could. I went against everything I was supposed to do with the camera." [...] Savides felt comfortable with the camera after discovering its limitations.|$|E
500|$|Through Caldwell more {{officers}} {{joined the}} protest, including two other celebrated aces, Wing Commander Bobby Gibbes and Squadron Leader John Waddy, {{as well as}} Squadron Leader Bert Grace, Squadron Leader Douglas Vanderfield, and later, Squadron Leader Stuart Harpham. During {{a series of meetings}} early in April 1945, Caldwell proposed that the eight resign en masse, and the others agreed. Arthur later stated that, [...] "I meant to make as big a fuss <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>possibly</b> could with the object of getting the position corrected... All the same, we realised that, to lay ourselves open to any charge of mutiny, we might lessen the force of what we were doing, which was the reason we put the things in as resignations and not as any attempt to unseat people higher up." ...|$|E

500|$|In late February {{and early}} March 2007, the band headlined a North American {{with support from}} Underoath and Armor for Sleep. On April 2, [...] "My Blue Heaven" [...] was {{released}} as a single and released to radio a week later. From late July to early September, the band participated in the 2007 Projekt Revolution tour with Linkin Park. On August 3 {{it was announced that}} O'Connell had injured his back, and he was replaced by Matchbook Romance drummer Aaron Stern {{for the remainder of the}} tour. Shortly after the tour Mascherino left the band, although his departure was not announced until early October. He said, [...] "It was getting to the point where I felt I had taken the road as long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>possibly</b> could," [...] and his compositions were [...] "more pop than anyone else [...] wanted to go." [...] Mascherino had written over 45 songs, most intended for Louder Now but turned down by the band. He began a solo project, the Color Fred.|$|E
500|$|However, Mascherino {{left the}} band {{following}} {{the end of}} the tour. He said, [...] "It was {{getting to the point where}} I felt I had taken the road as long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>possibly</b> could," [...] and his compositions were [...] "more pop than anyone else [...] wanted to go". In October, the group revealed that their next album was [...] "in its very early stages". In December, Rubano said the group was in New York City working on new material, having already written six songs. Prior to demoing, O'Connell had to have back surgery, having injured it during the Projekt Revolution tour. During the demoing process, the group tried different drummers, but according to Rubano: [...] "They just weren't Mark. Not enough ferocity, intensity." [...] Following this, the band's members took time to refocus themselves after several years of constant touring. Lazzara sorted his life out following addiction issues, ending his engagement to Chauntelle DuPree of Eisley. He subsequently moved to another town, got married, and had a child. O'Connell also got married, Reyes spent time with his family, and Rubano recorded music for the TV show Electric Company.|$|E
500|$|In April 1945, having {{recently}} assumed {{command of}} No.1 TAF's No.78 Wing, Arthur helped trigger {{an incident that}} {{became known as the}} [...] "Morotai Mutiny" [...] (a phrase originating in one of his aide memoires at the time). He was one of eight senior pilots, including Australia's top-scoring ace, Group Captain Clive Caldwell, and fellow veterans from the North African campaign, Bobby Gibbes and John Waddy, who attempted to resign their commissions in protest at the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground attack missions. Frustrated at the lack of attention paid by Headquarters No.1 TAF to a [...] "balance sheet" [...] he produced showing that operational losses outweighed results, Arthur later said that his object for the [...] "mutiny" [...] was to [...] "make as big a fuss <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>possibly</b> could with the object of getting the position corrected." [...] A government inquiry into the incident exonerated the pilots, finding their motives in tendering their resignations to be sincere. Arthur remained in charge of No.78 Wing for the Battle of Tarakan, which commenced on 1May. He handed over command of the wing on 24May, but remained on Tarakan {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

500|$|Although What You Were Hoping For? was {{acclaimed}} by critics, {{it received}} some backlash from Hunt's fanbase and listeners, who were ambivalent about its stylistic departure from his previous work. He addressed the criticism {{in an interview}} for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: [...] "Other recording artists will supply their fans with an album full of songs they will enjoy for 15 or 20 years. I'm a man that grows, progresses and matures, I want to grow [...] {{with the people who}} want to go with me on that journey ... An artist should put out work that the culture should inspire to as opposed to trying to meet the culture, that's backwards to me. I don't just sit down and worry about what people will like, my job is to express myself as honest <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>possibly</b> can." [...] What You Were Hoping For? peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers Albums, which is a weekly music chart that ranks top-selling albums by new or developing acts, defined as those who have never appeared in the top 100 of the Billboard 200 or in the top 10 of Billboards component charts. The album also reached number 50 on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart.|$|E

2500|$|Although her novels {{typically}} {{concentrate on}} black women, Morrison does not identify her works as feminist. When {{asked in a}} 1998 interview [...] "Why distance oneself from feminism?" [...] she replied: [...] "In order to be as free <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>possibly</b> can, in my own imagination, I can't take positions that are closed. Everything I've ever done, in the writing world, has been to expand articulation, rather than to close it, to open doors, sometimes, not even closing the book – leaving the endings open for reinterpretation, revisitation, a little ambiguity." [...] She went on to state that she thought it [...] "off-putting to some readers, who may feel that I'm involved in writing some kind of feminist tract. I don't subscribe to patriarchy, and I don't {{think it should be}} substituted with matriarchy. I think it's a question of equitable access, and opening doors to all sorts of things." ...|$|E

2500|$|High Def Digest gave {{a rating}} of 4 stars, writing [...] "The Simpsons' {{is one of only}} a handful of shows that I know I'm {{guaranteed}} to laugh out loud at least once an episode (usually more). Even though the cutting wit of the first decade lost its edge a bit, I still find 'The Simpsons' an extremely enjoyable way to spend my time. There aren't many things that are better than sitting down with a new season of 'The Simpsons' on Blu-ray and watching every episode back to back as fast <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>possibly</b> can. While the episodes sort of blend together, the humor is still there, and I still end up having quite a few genuine laughs". CraveOnline rated the season 8.5/10, noting [...] "Some [...] "Simpsons" [...] fans gave up during a perceived rough patch around season 12, and boy have they missed out. Season 13 was a particular favorite of mine, but now we're over the hump on the DVD releases. Season 15 is kind of a sweet spot, because it's got some highlight episodes I love, but also plenty that I don't remember." [...] DVDActive said [...] "The Simpsons season 15 isn't one of the series' best, but I'm pretty sure it isn't one of the worst either". ScreenJabber gave {{a rating of}} 4 stars, writing [...] "Imagine my surprise when I sat down to review Season 15...and realised that I had never seen most of its episodes. Imagine, then, my joy at being able to enjoy almost 22 episodes of factory-fresh Simpsons, even though they were made about a decade ago. And even though some of the cultural references are a little dated, there's still an awful lot to laugh at and enjoy here. As always, this season of The Simpsons features a stellar line-up of guest stars. And, as always, there are some standout episodes. All in all, a more than decent season of this long, long-running show." [...] DIY wrote [...] "While Season 15 of The Simpsons may not be golden from start to finish it has a higher great to soggy episode ratio than more recent seasons. In fact, there are some real gems amongst the 22 episodes". Boxofficebuz gave it 4 stars, and said [...] "...Throw in flashback episode 'The Way We ,' Pie-Man antics in 'Simple Simpson' and a Catch Me If You Can spoof in 'Catch 'Em If You Can,' you have a solid, solid season. A definite uptick over the previous couple seasons". BubbleBlabber rated it 9.0 out of 10, and concluded [...] "In terms of the content, Season 15 was a highly underrated season for The Simpsons and brought along a number of now well-known classics". DVDMg gave the season a B, and wrote [...] "Should viewers expect greatness from Season 15 of The Simpsons? No, as the year comes with some mediocre shows. Still, it delivers a reasonable number of good episodes and seems worthwhile overall...S15 won't win over new fans, but it's usually fun".|$|E
