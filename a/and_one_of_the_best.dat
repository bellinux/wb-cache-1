Its origins are obscure and several theories have been advanced to suggest original meanings.|$|E

5|$|In January 1992 Walsh {{was made}} chief {{executive}} of Pillsbury, {{in addition to his}} job as CFO of the Grand Met food division.

5|$|In a loose, {{unstructured}} modernist narrative {{style that}} draws from Christian allegory and oral storytelling, Faulkner explores themes of race, sex, class and {{religion in the}} American South. By focusing on characters that are misfits, outcasts, or are otherwise marginalized in their community, he portrays the clash of alienated individuals against a Puritanical, prejudiced rural society. Early reception of the novel was mixed, with some reviewers critical of Faulkner's style and subject matter. However, over time, the novel {{has come to be}} {{considered one of the most}} important literary works by Faulkner <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> English-language novels of the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Archduke Charles, {{brother of}} the Austrian Emperor, had started to reform the Austrian army in 1801 by taking away power from the Hofkriegsrat, the military-political council {{responsible}} for the armed forces. Charles was Austria's best field commander, but he was unpopular at court and lost much influence when, against his advice, Austria {{decided to go to}} war with France. Karl Mack became the new main commander in Austria's army, instituting reforms on the eve of the war that called for a regiment to be composed of four battalions of four companies, rather than three battalions of six companies. Austrian cavalry was considered the best in Europe, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of the time anywhere.|$|E
5|$|Cited as an {{influential}} {{title in the}} video game industry <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> games of all time, Shadow of the Colossus is often regarded as an important example of video game as art due to its minimalist landscape designs, immersive gameplay and emotional journey. It received wide critical acclaim {{by the media and}} was met with strong sales compared to Ico, due in part to a larger marketing campaign. The soundtrack was also widely praised. The game won several awards for its audio, design, and overall quality. Shadow of the Colossus is also referenced numerous times in debates regarding the art quality and emotional perspectives of video games. A remake of the game with ultra-high definition art assets is currently in development and scheduled for release on the PlayStation 4 in 2018.|$|E

5|$|Following several {{membership}} {{changes and}} unsuccessful releases, My Bloody Valentine signed to Creation Records in 1988. The band released {{a number of}} successful EPs, including You Made Me Realise (1988), Glider (1990) and Tremolo (1991), and two studio albums, Isn't Anything (1988) and Loveless (1991) on the label. Loveless, which {{has been described as}} the band's magnum opus <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> albums of the 1990s, was a major critical success. However, the band were dropped by Creation Records after its release due to the album's extensive production costs. In 1992, My Bloody Valentine signed to Island Records and recorded several albums worth of unreleased material, remaining largely inactive. Following the departure of Googe and Ó Cíosóig in 1995, My Bloody Valentine later disbanded in 1997.|$|E

5|$|In {{retrospective}} {{reviews of}} the Genesis version, Dynamite Headdy has continued to receive considerable praise. Critics agreed that the game is excellent despite not receiving the same legendary status as some of Treasure's other works such as Gunstar Heroes, Ikaruga, and Radiant Silvergun. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN said the game is overload on the eyes, but it makes sense with respect to Treasure's chaotic design. Frank Provo of GameSpot noted the game's impressive graphical effects, large bosses, and bizarre premise providing {{the same level of}} excitement as Gunstar Heroes. Damien McFarren of Nintendo Life called it one of the best Treasure games of the Genesis era <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> platformers on the system.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{opinion of}} the theatre is more generous, with English Heritage {{describing}} the building as both Phipps' finest work <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> planned theatres in London. The building was Grade II* listed in January 1970. Appreciation of the buildings came {{too late to save}} the adjacent hotel from redevelopment as the new High Commission for New Zealand, completed in 1963 by British architects Robert Matthew, Johnson Marshall and Partners, who also designed the Commonwealth Institute. In 1995, this too was Grade II listed as a fine example of 1960s architecture. The 200-year-old Royal Opera Arcade, built by Nash and Repton, is all that survives of the second theatre and is the earliest example of a London arcade.|$|E
5|$|The 1930s saw the début of the club's {{most celebrated}} player, Stanley Matthews. Matthews, {{who grew up}} in Hanley, was an {{apprentice}} at the club and made his first appearance, aged 17, in March 1932 against Bury. By end of the decade, Matthews had established himself as an England international <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> footballers of his generation. Matthews won his first England cap in 1934, making him the first Stoke player in 30 years to play for England. Stoke achieved promotion from the Second Division in the 1932–33 season as champions, but Matthews only featured in 15 games, although he did score his first goal for the club in a 3–1 win against local rivals Port Vale.|$|E
