5|$|As of 2010, {{agriculture}} was {{the major}} profession {{in most of the}} provinces in Zambia. Maize, mixed beans, rice, sorghum, soya beans, sunflower, sweet potatoes <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> were the major crops in the provinces. Among all provinces, Central had the maximum area, , constituting 20.64 per cent, while Luapula had the smallest area at 3.06 per cent of the total area. Maize production was maximum in Eastern (22.5%), mixed beans (51.66%) in Northern, sorghum in Southern (40.62%), sunflower in Eastern (70.2%), soya beans (45.06%), sweet potatoes (28.5%) <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> (49.51%) in Central Province.|$|E
5|$|The campaigning {{season was}} by now well-advanced, as Julian {{had spent a}} {{considerable}} time restoring Saverne. But it was still summer, as the weather was hot <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> was ripe in the fields. It was therefore probably August.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the Strip {{west of the}} Toledo area is a prime {{location}} for agriculture, because of its well-drained, fertile loam soil. The area had for many years produced large amounts of corn <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> per acre. Michigan and Ohio both wanted what seemed strategically and economically destined to become an important port and a prosperous region.|$|E
50|$|Major {{crops in}} the area include barley, canola, durum, flax seed, oats, spring <b>wheat,</b> <b>and</b> winter <b>wheat,</b> with the most seeded acres {{dedicated}} to durum <b>and</b> spring <b>wheat.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{next step}} up from extract brewing {{is to use a}} diastatically active malt extract to convert {{starches}} from other beer adjuncts such as flaked and torrified barleys, flaked <b>and</b> torrified <b>wheat,</b> <b>wheat</b> flour, <b>and</b> flaked oats into fermentable sugars. These extracts are currently only available in the canned form. Unmalted barleys <b>and</b> <b>wheats</b> can add extra [...] "body" [...] to a finished beer.|$|R
5|$|Land grant {{records in}} 1801 {{indicate}} that Baker had twelve acres of maize <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> under cultivation with another twelve acres lying fallow, {{and that he}} owned one horse, four goats and 22 hogs. His two unpaid servants were recorded as still being present on the farm. In 1800 Baker also bought and began operating a public house, The Royal Oak, selling alcohol to convicts and settlers in Windsor.|$|E
5|$|Mourning doves show a {{preference}} for the seeds of certain species of plant over others. Foods taken in preference to others include pine nuts, sweetgum seeds, and the seeds of pokeberry, amaranth, canary grass, corn, sesame, <b>and</b> <b>wheat.</b> When their favorite foods are absent, mourning doves will eat the seeds of other plants, including buckwheat, rye, goosegrass and smartweed.|$|E
5|$|Proteins were {{recognized}} as a distinct class of biological molecules {{in the eighteenth century}} by Antoine Fourcroy and others, distinguished by the molecules' ability to coagulate or flocculate under treatments with heat or acid. Noted examples at the time included albumin from egg whites, blood serum albumin, fibrin, <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> gluten.|$|E

5|$|Sarus cranes {{preferentially}} use wetlands or uncultivated patches amid flooded {{rice paddies}} (locally called khet-taavadi) for nesting in India. Breeding pairs are territorial and prefer to forage in natural wetlands, though wet crops like rice <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> are also frequented. In south-western Uttar Pradesh, sarus cranes {{were found in}} wetlands of all sizes with larger number in larger wetlands.|$|E
5|$|Shen's largest atlas {{included}} twenty three maps of China {{and foreign}} regions that were drawn at a uniform scale of 1:900,000. Shen {{also created a}} raised-relief map using sawdust, wood, beeswax, <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> paste. Zhu Xi (1130–1200) {{was inspired by the}} raised-relief map of Huang Shang and so made his own portable map made of wood and clay which could be folded up from eight hinged pieces.|$|E
5|$|The new tolls {{cause the}} price of food and other {{essentials}} to rise, enriching both Süß and the Duke. Süß gains the authority to levy taxes on salt, beer, wine, <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> as well. He also assists in procuring local women for the Duke, thus engaging in the corruption of their morals. The increase in {{the price of}} basic necessities causes the people of Württemberg to suffer great privation.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} forms of <b>wheat</b> are white <b>and</b> red <b>wheat.</b> However, other natural forms of wheat exist. Other commercially minor but nutritionally {{promising}} species of naturally evolved wheat species include black, yellow <b>and</b> blue <b>wheat.</b>|$|R

50|$|Unaizah is an {{agricultural}} area <b>and</b> produces <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> barley of various strains. The region also grows grapes, grapefruits, lemons, leeks, mandarins, oranges, pomegranates and dates.|$|R
5|$|After World War II, {{industrial}} development quickened. New technology increased farm productivity through automation of feedlots for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings. Planting became more specialized with hybridization of corn <b>and</b> <b>wheat,</b> {{and the use}} of farm machinery such as tractors and combines became the norm. University of Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to these developments as part of the Green Revolution. Suburban development accelerated due to increased postwar housing demand and convenient transportation. Increased mobility, in turn, enabled more specialized jobs.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on water supplies originating outside its borders, making it highly vulnerable to changes in water supply due to climate change. Droughts are frequent and devastating. Several years of droughts {{during the last decade}} have severely affected agricultural production and reduced economic growth. A drought in 2009 was the worst drought in more than 50 years. Many cattle died of hunger, and huge swaths of soy, corn <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> fields were affected. It was estimated that the country lost more than US$5billion from the drought. A drought in 2011 affected farming of soy and corn, causing losses of US$2.5billion.|$|E
5|$|Climate-related natural {{disasters}} cause massive losses of Indian life and property. Droughts, flash floods, cyclones, avalanches, landslides {{brought on by}} torrential rains, and snowstorms pose the greatest threats. Other dangers include frequent summer dust storms, which usually track from north to south; they cause extensive property damage in North India and deposit large amounts of dust from arid regions. Hail is also common in parts of India, causing severe damage to standing crops such as rice <b>and</b> <b>wheat.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cotton, soybeans, red {{chili peppers}} <b>and</b> <b>wheats</b> are main crops in this area. The Bhilgaon and {{surrounding}} areas are developing very rapidly. A thread manufacturing unit {{has been established}} in this village. Bhilgaon was earlier known as Bhileshwar.|$|R

In November, during a family emergency, MacKinnon travels to Kamloops where he suspends his 100-mile diet a few days. They finally find a source of flour when they discover a farmer on Vancouver Island who grows his own fruits, vegetables, meats, <b>and</b> <b>wheat.</b> In December, Smith travels to Edmonton where her grandmother feeds her microwaved pasta which she accepts.|$|E
5|$|Farmer asked U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack for {{declarations}} of agricultural disasters {{in the wake}} of an ice storm in January 2009 that endangered the state's livestock and flooding that affected Kentucky Lake in 2010, damaging large portions of the state's corn, soybean, <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> crops. In December 2010, he launched a joint investigation with Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway into claims that the Eastern Livestock company had not paid Kentucky cattlemen for $130 million in livestock.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{depend on}} plants for food, either {{directly}} or as feed for domestic animals. Agriculture deals with the production of food crops, and has {{played a key role}} in the history of world civilizations. Agriculture includes agronomy for arable crops, horticulture for vegetables and fruit, and forestry for timber. About 7,000 species of plant have been used for food, though most of today's food is derived from only 30 species. The major staples include cereals such as rice <b>and</b> <b>wheat,</b> starchy roots and tubers such as cassava and potato, and legumes such as peas and beans. Vegetable oils such as olive oil provide lipids, while fruit and vegetables contribute vitamins and minerals to the diet.|$|E

5|$|In Ancient China, rice was {{the staple}} crop {{in the south}} <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> in the north, the latter made into dumplings, noodles, and pancakes. Vegetables used to {{accompany}} these included yams, soybeans, broad beans, turnips, spring onions, and garlic. The diet of the ancient Egyptians was based on bread, often contaminated with sand which wore away their teeth. Meat was a luxury but fish was more plentiful. These were accompanied by a range of vegetables including marrows, broad beans, lentils, onions, leeks, garlic, radishes, and lettuces.|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} after Hurricane Kate struck the island, the {{government}} of Cuba issued a request to the United Nations (UN) World Food Council for international assistance. In response, various UN member nations collectively provided $60,000 for pesticides; $250,000 for herbicides, fungicides, and potato seeds; and $1.381 million in cooking oils and beans to fulfill the dietary needs of over 475,000 people for 60 days. The Soviet Union also donated about $15 million worth of rice <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> flour.|$|E
5|$|Most {{settlers}} in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed {{within a few}} decades {{as varied as the}} settlements. Cash crops included tobacco, rice <b>and</b> <b>wheat.</b> Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply. Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive, freed indentured servants pushed further west.|$|E
