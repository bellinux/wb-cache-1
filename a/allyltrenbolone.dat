It is available for veterinary use in both Europe (as Regumate) and the United States (as Matrix), and has been marketed as Regumate since the early 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Altrenogest is an estrane (C18) steroid and 19-nortestosterone {{derivative}} known chemically as 17α-allyl-19-nor-δ9,11-testosterone or 17α-allylestra-4,9,11-trien-17β-ol-3-one. It {{is one of}} {{only two}} marketed progestins that possesses a 17α-allyl group, the other being allylestrenol. Most other progestins possess a 17α-ethynyl group, while AAS, if they are 17α-substituted, are usually 17α-alkylated (with a methyl or ethyl group). Altrenogest is the 17α-allylated derivative of the AAS trenbolone (and hence can also be referred to as <b>allyltrenbolone</b> or allyltrienolone), which itself is the 9,11-didehydro analogue of the AAS nandrolone (19-nortestosterone).|$|E
