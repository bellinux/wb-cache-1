Insufficient knowledge {{is available on the}} impact of site-specific factors on the feasibility of CO 2 capture at industrial plant level. This article presents a techno-economic analysis and an inventory of potential implementation and operational challenges related to the three main CO 2 capture technologies applied at industrial plant level for the short term (2020 – 2025) and long term (2040 – 2050). Five industrial plants from various industrial sectors (a medium and large sized petroleum refinery, a small and medium sized chemical plant, and a large hydrogen plant) in the Netherlands were used for this study. The results show the lowest CO 2 <b>avoidance</b> <b>costs</b> for the refineries (24 – 57 €/t) and chemical plants (37 – 124 €/t) when operated in oxyfuel combustion mode, both for the short and long term, although post-combustion is economically preferable for the smallest chemical plant (117 €/t) in the short term. For the hydrogen plant, <b>avoidance</b> <b>costs</b> (67 €/t) are lowest when capturing CO 2 solely from the high-pressure process gas. For the short term cases, spatial constraints on existing plant sites could increase the indicated CO 2 <b>avoidance</b> <b>costs,</b> especially for post-combustion capture; for the long term cases, new-built capture ready process units, plant integration and optimized utilities are expected to lower the <b>avoidance</b> <b>costs</b> for all three capture technologies...|$|E

40|$|Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is one {{promising}} technology {{currently under}} investigation for reducing CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel power plants. However, the current cost associated with CO 2 capture is high which is limiting its wide-scale application. Therefore, the concept of flexible capture has been proposed to reduce <b>avoidance</b> <b>costs.</b> Flexible CO 2 capture is a strategy {{that can be achieved}} {{in a number of ways}} including adding a solvent storage tank for the capture process, operating the capture facility at different rates at different times or by load-shifting. This study investigates the opportunities of applying a load-shifting strategy in the Australian electricity market. Load-shifting involves maintaining the total electricity output to the grid from a group of power plants constant while maximising the CO 2 capture at individual power plants. The assessment in this thesis indicates that load-shifting enables up to 90 % of CO 2 emissions to be captured while maintaining the electricity output. It was found that load-shifting was able to increase the available energy for capture and reduced the CO 2 emissions compared to without load-shifting. The SRMC and <b>avoidance</b> <b>costs</b> were found to be similar for applying capture with and without load-shifting. However the LRMCe values were lower with load-shifting compared to without load-shifting. If the load-shifting strategy is phased across the power plants over time, the results indicate different capture implementation pathways capture different amounts of CO 2, but at similar cost. The difference in the cumulative amount of CO 2 captured can be up to 25 % between the different pathways...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCO 2 {{avoidance}} cost economics are {{an essential}} {{tool for analysis}} {{of the potential for}} future CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) utilization. The CO 2 avoidance cost is the CO 2 tax at which the product cost is the same for either a fossil fuel plant without CO 2 mitigation (but paying the CO 2 tax) or the same fossil fuel plant that includes the added capital and efficiency losses of adding CCS (but avoiding most of the CO 2 tax). The CO 2 tax must be higher than this CO 2 avoidance cost to justify the higher risks, capital, and lower efficiency of utilizing CCS. Understanding which issues impact CO 2 <b>avoidance</b> <b>costs</b> the most is fundamental to economically encouraging the massive CO 2 reductions enabled with CCS. SFA Pacific recently completed two similar economic analyses of coal-based power plant CO 2 mitigation costs. Both analyses included the options of converting to lower CO 2 emissions with natural gas (with and without CCS) and continued coal use with and without CCS. One analysis was for an existing coal-based power plant baseline as part of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Workshop and Report entitled Retrofitting of Coal-Fired Power Plants for CO 2  Emissions Reductions . The second analysis was for a new coal-based power plant baseline as part of an analysis of CO 2 mitigation options by the U. S. Business Roundtable entitled The Balancing Act: Climate Change, Energy Security and the U. S. Economy . However, the resulting CO 2 <b>avoidance</b> <b>costs</b> for these two analyses were very different. Specifically, the CO 2 avoidance cost was about twice as high for the existing coal power plant than for the new coal power plant baseline. There are basic technical and economic reasons for this big difference in CO 2 <b>avoidance</b> <b>costs.</b> They are best explained by simply showing the costs and performance of each baseline without and then with CCS in simple, transparent, and consistent one-page models. This enables easy, insightful side-by-side direct comparisons. Since first developing a cost and performance economic screening model of CCS for our GHGT- 4 paper in 1998  , SFA Pacific has continued to improve the model which focuses on objectivity by stressing transparency and consistency with easy to compare cases. SFA Pacific has clearly shown identical inputs for key items such as fuel costs, non-fuel operating costs, unit capital costs, contingencies, site location factors, cost indexes, and especially capital charges. This makes it easy to see that power costs for the existing coal power plant baseline can be very low when the power plant is old and most of the existing capital is already paid-off. This GHGT- 10 paper presents the most updated SFA Pacific analysis of CCS retrofit for existing coal power plant CO 2 mitigation. The paper focuses on showing and explaining why the CO 2 <b>avoidance</b> <b>costs</b> can be much higher for the existing plants versus new fossil fuel power plants. CO 2 taxes which are high enough to discourage new coal power plants with high CO 2 emissions would likely have little or no impact on existing coal power plants. Until the over 1, 200 GW of existing old coal power plants begin reducing their high CO 2 emissions, there can be little net reduction in worldwide CO 2 growth. Converting or replacing this large capacity of existing coal power plants is essential to obtaining large CO 2 reductions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractOxyfuel {{has been}} hoped {{by many to}} provide the “step-change” in {{performance}} needed to drive down the avoidance cost of carbon capture from pulverized coal plants. To investigate this possibility, a techno- economic oxyfuel model was constructed. The model was exercised to explore the effect on CO 2 avoidance cost and LCOE from several key parameters, namely: CO 2 purity, oxidant purity, CPU and ASU performance and cost, coal composition, and geographic location. Monte-Carlo techniques were then used to generate distributions for CO 2 avoidance cost and LCOE which were compared to costs for a representative amine based post-combustion capture system. Results indicate that increasing restrictions on CO 2 exit purity will translate directly to higher <b>avoidance</b> <b>costs.</b> Consequently, any future pipeline purity standards should seek to balance costs with safety concerns and storage capacity limitations. A trade-off between equipment downsizing and energy of separation for oxidant purity was identified and found to be optimized in the 95 - 97 % oxygen range. The effect of oxidant purity on CO 2 transport cost is small (∼ 2 %) compared {{to the effects of}} CO 2 exit purity (∼ 15 %). Both represent changes to a cost which amounts to only about 5 % of the total avoidance cost. Stochastic modeling results provide evidence that oxyfuel technology is unlikely to be competitive with post-combustion capture for a number of coal types, especially those high in sulfur. Oxyfuel appears most promising for use with low-sulfur coals and is capable of delivering lower <b>avoidance</b> <b>costs</b> than amine-based capture when operated with co-capture of SO 2 and non-condensable gases...|$|E

This study highlights the technical and economic issues that need consideration by power generators in meeting the expected increase in energy demand while also meeting greenhouse gas targets. The strategy examined in this study is time phased post combustion capture retrofitted to existing power plants coupled with refurbishment of the power plant. The effect on the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) and the <b>avoidance</b> <b>cost</b> is investigated for both coal and natural gas fired generators. This study assumes that 20 % of the Australian electricity fleet is retrofitted with capture in 2020, increasing in 20 % increments at 5 -year intervals until 2040 when all the fossil fuel power plants have capture retrofitted. The LCOE increases from current values of A$ 50 - 57 per MWh to A$ 100 - 120 per MWh for complete implementation of capture in 2040. At the same time, the CO 2 emission intensity of the fleet gradually reduces from 0. 6 tonnes per MWh to less than 0. 1 tonnes per MWh. With phased implementation, the number of power plants that have capture increases over time and hence the <b>avoidance</b> <b>cost</b> increases from A$ 100 – 160 per tonne of CO 2 avoided if capture is implemented in 2020 to A$ 150 – 240 per tonne of CO 2 avoided if capture is implemented in 2040...|$|R

Once the cases were analyzed and compared against each other, advantages or trends in <b>cost</b> savings, <b>cost</b> <b>avoidance,</b> and public value became apparent. Upon completion of our analysis, we determined that cost savings were usually gained from reduced system unit costs due to higher economic order quantities, reduced overhead costs per unit, and reduced unit costs resulting from manufacturing learning curves. Additional costs were avoided by reducing gaps in production lines. Furthermore, we {{determined that the}} Army’s FMS strategy needs improvement {{in order to take}} full advantage of these sources of cost savings and <b>cost</b> <b>avoidance.</b> Outstanding ThesisMajor, United States ArmyCaptain, United States Arm...|$|R
