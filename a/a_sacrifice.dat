5|$|Reformed confessions {{reject the}} Catholic {{doctrine}} that the Eucharist is <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of propitiation, or sacrifice to satisfy God's wrath and attain forgiveness of sins. Instead, they teach that Christ's body {{is only to}} be received, not re-presented to God as <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice.</b> The confessions do sometimes speak of the Supper as <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of thanksgiving for the gift of propitiation which has been received. In the twentieth century, Scottish Reformed theologian T. F. Torrance developed a strong doctrine of Eucharistic sacrifice. He argued that Christ's person and work could not be separated, and that the Eucharist mediated his sacrificial death.|$|E
5|$|When {{a batter}} {{attempts}} <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> bunt {{and the resulting}} bunt is so well-placed that he safely reaches first base, the official scorer may elect to credit the batter with a hit instead of <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> {{if there is no}} error on the play and an ordinary effort by the defense would not have recorded an out.|$|E

Hibiki tries to help by making the sacrifices a little more bearable.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> magnet <b>sacrifice</b> {{is similar}} to <b>a</b> {{deflection}} <b>sacrifice,</b> but the motivation behind <b>a</b> magnet <b>sacrifice</b> is to pull an opponent's piece to a tactically poor square, rather than pulling it away from a crucial square.|$|R

5|$|A forced {{variation}} {{that involves}} <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> and usually {{results in a}} tangible gain is called a combination. Brilliant combinations– {{such as those in}} the Immortal Game– are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers. A common type of chess exercise, aimed at developing players' skills, is showing players a position where a decisive combination is available and challenging them to find it.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Baker {{lost much}} of his savings in the Panic of 1907 and could only afford to send {{one of his sons}} to college. Thornton agreed to let his talented younger brother {{continue}} his education, <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> that Hobey Baker never forgot. Although an above-average student, Baker stayed an extra year at St. Paul's in 1909 to allow his father another year to save money. By the time Baker left St. Paul's, his sporting achievements had helped make him one of the school's most popular students.|$|E

5|$|Aratus took {{advantage}} of this incident, and began plotting against Cleomenes with King Antigonus III Doson of Macedon. Previously, in 227 BC, two ambassadors from Megalopolis {{had been sent to}} Macedon to request help. Antigonus showed little interest at the time, and these efforts failed. Aratus wanted the Macedonian king to come to the Peloponnese and defeat Cleomenes, but Antigonus asked control of Acrocorinth in return. This was <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> that the League was not willing to make, however, and they declined to seek help from Macedon.|$|E
5|$|In the Shatapatha Brahmana, Manu {{performed}} a fire-sacrifice {{in order to}} have children. Idā emerged from the sacrifice. She was claimed by Mitra-Varuna, but she lived with Manu and together they initiated the race of Manu. In this text, Idā is the goddess of the sacrificial meal. She is described as the Mānavi (daughter of Manu) and Ghṛtapadī (with the ghee-dripping foot) and she is represented by a cow, also known as Idā during <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice.</b> Pururavas is mentioned as the son of Ilā in the text.|$|E
5|$|Isaac was {{the only}} patriarch who stayed in Canaan during his whole life and though once he tried to leave, God {{told him not to}} do so. Rabbinic {{tradition}} gave the explanation that Isaac was almost sacrificed and anything dedicated as <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> may not leave the Land of Israel. Isaac was the oldest of the biblical patriarchs {{at the time of his}} death, and the only patriarch whose name was not changed.|$|E

30|$|A {{method to}} improve the growth {{repeatability}} of low-density InAs/GaAs self-assembled quantum dots by molecular beam epitaxy is reported. <b>A</b> <b>sacrificed</b> InAs layer was deposited firstly to determine in situ the accurate parameters of two- to three-dimensional transitions by observation of reflection high-energy electron diffraction patterns, and then the InAs layer annealed immediately before {{the growth of the}} low-density InAs quantum dots (QDs). It is confirmed by micro-photoluminescence that control repeatability of low-density QD growth is improved averagely to about 80 % which is much higher than that of the QD samples without using <b>a</b> <b>sacrificed</b> InAs layer.|$|R
5|$|Partner {{communication}} {{is essential in}} a good defense. When one partner is under attack, the other partner {{should be aware of}} which pieces hurt most. Sitting strategies might be necessary, and it is therefore important to play the defense fast. Accepting <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> can be lethal. On the other hand, it results in the attacker having a piece less to play with, with the defender's partner having a piece more. Sacrifices therefore give the partner of the defender an opportunity to take initiative.|$|E
5|$|Several basic {{offensive}} tactics {{come into}} play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating {{a gap in the}} infield for the batter to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even {{at the expense of the}} batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice.</b> (A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) <b>A</b> <b>sacrifice</b> bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play. With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> fly. The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.|$|E
5|$|The Braves scored {{their fifth}} {{run in the}} eighth as Del Crandall hit a one-out triple and then scored on <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> fly by Mantilla. Don Demeter pinch hit for Churn, the pitcher, in {{the bottom half of}} the inning but the Dodgers were put out in order. Sandy Koufax pitched the top of the ninth for the Dodgers and though he loaded the bases with three {{successive}} walks to Aaron, Torre, and DeMerit he did not allow any runs. Moon and Snider led off the bottom of the frame with successive singles. Bob Lillis pinch ran for Snider and Gil Hodges hit another single to load the bases. Don McMahon relieved Burdette, but allowed a fourth consecutive single to Norm Larker which scored Moon, Lillis, and advanced Hodges to third leaving the score 5–4. Warren Spahn relieved McMahon, Carl Furillo pinch hit for Roseboro, and Joe Pignatano pinch ran for Larker. Furillo tied the game, hitting <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> fly which scored Hodges. Spahn allowed a single to Wills and was pulled in favor of Joey Jay. Ron Fairly grounded out as a pinch hitter and Gilliam flew out, leaving the game tied at five runs apiece and forcing extra innings.|$|E

5|$|The Cardinals scored one run in {{both the}} second and third innings on <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> fly by Mike Matheny to score Jim Edmonds and a home run to right field by Walker, respectively. However, {{in the bottom of the}} third, the Red Sox scored three runs after seven {{consecutive}} batters reached base, giving them a five-run lead. Dan Haren came in from the Cardinals' bullpen to replace Williams during the inning.|$|E
5|$|This {{remains the}} only nine-inning major league game where the teams {{combined}} for just one hit. The game's only run, scored by the Dodgers, was unearned. The Dodger run was scored without a recorded at bat—Lou Johnson walked, reached second on <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> bunt, stole third, and scored when the throw {{to get him out}} at third went wild.|$|E
5|$|Three major {{theological}} controversies {{occurred during}} Manuel's reign. In 1156–1157 {{the question was}} raised whether Christ had offered himself as <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> {{for the sins of}} the world to the Father and to the Holy Spirit only, or also to the Logos (i.e., to himself). In the end a synod held at Constantinople in 1157 adopted a compromise formula, that the Word made flesh offered a double sacrifice to the Holy Trinity, despite the dissidence of Patriarch of Antioch-elect Soterichus Panteugenus.|$|E

5|$|Vic Lombardi {{replaced}} Behrman {{in the top}} of the sixth. He allowed {{just one}} hit to Dickson, keeping the score 5–1 when Brooklyn came up to bat. Whitman, Galan, and Dixie Walker all grounded out to end the inning. In the top of the seventh, Lombardi allowed two walks, then Dusak hit <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> bunt, after which Lombardi was replaced by Higbe. Marion hit <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> bunt as well, which allowed Kurowski to score. Higbe quickly got the third out, and the Dodgers again went hitless in the seventh, making the score 6–1 at the end of seven innings. In the top of the eighth, Dickson struck out, while Red Schoendienst singled and Moore doubled. Musial was intentionally walked to load the bases, and Kurowski singled, allowing two baserunners to score and making the game 8–1 in favor of the Cardinals. After another walk, Higbe was replaced on the pitcher's mound by Rube Melton, who got the final two outs of the inning.|$|E
5|$|After {{six innings}} of {{allowing}} no earned runs – {{which gave him}} a total of 13 innings against the Yankees and Cardinals with only one earned run allowed on a torn ankle tendon – Schilling made way for Alan Embree, who pitched a scoreless seventh. Mike Timlin replaced Embree in the eighth, in which <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> fly by Scott Rolen reduced the Red Sox lead to four. Keith Foulke then came in to strike out Jim Edmonds to end the inning and also pitched the ninth to end the game. For the second game in a row, the Red Sox won despite committing four fielding errors.|$|E
5|$|After {{the casting}} of stones, animals are {{slaughtered}} {{to commemorate the}} story of Abraham and Ishmael. Traditionally the pilgrims slaughtered the animal themselves, or oversaw the slaughtering. Today many pilgrims buy <b>a</b> <b>sacrifice</b> voucher in Mecca before the greater Hajj begins, which allows an animal to be slaughtered {{in the name of}} God (Allah) on the 10th, without the pilgrim being physically present. Modern abattoirs complete the processing of the meat, which is then sent as charity to poor people around the world. At {{the same time as the}} sacrifices occur at Mecca, Muslims worldwide perform similar sacrifices, in a three-day global festival called Eid al-Adha.|$|E
