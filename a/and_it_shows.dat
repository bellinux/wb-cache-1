5|$|Boron carbide's {{structure}} is only approximately B4C, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested stoichiometric ratio. This {{is due to}} its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with empirical formula B12C3 (i.e., with B12 dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon, as the suggested C3 units are replaced with C-B-C chains, and some smaller (B6) octahedra are present as well (see the boron carbide article for structural analysis). The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in tank armor, bulletproof vests, and numerous other structural applications.|$|E
5|$|Hardy and versatile, B.integrifolia {{will grow}} in clay, sand, acid and even {{alkaline}} soils, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> good resistance to wind and salt, making it suitable for seaside planting. It is therefore highly {{regarded as a}} low-maintenance garden tree, although its large size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens. Its hardiness may however forewarn weed potential, as some evidence of weediness has been seen in Western Australia and New Zealand. When growing near bushland within its native habitat, it is recommended to obtain local provenance seed or plants if available.|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} Bede's story, and in {{particular}} of the miraculous nature of Cædmon's poetic inspiration, are not generally accepted by scholars as being entirely accurate, but there seems no good reason to doubt {{the existence of a}} poet named Cædmon. Bede's narrative has to be read {{in the context of the}} Christian belief in miracles, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> at the very least that Bede, an educated and intelligent man, believed Cædmon to be an important figure in the history of English intellectual and religious life.|$|E

5|$|Gabbar Singh, the film's antagonist, {{was well}} {{received}} by the audience, despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty. Dissanayake explains that the audience {{was fascinated by the}} dialogues and mannerisms of the character, and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions, a first for Indian melodrama. He notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and uninhibited. He further notes that, unlike earlier melodramas in which the female body occupies the audience's attention as an object of male fetish, in Sholay, the male body becomes the centrepiece. It becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy. Dissanayake argues that Sholay {{can be viewed as a}} national allegory: it lacks a comforting logical narrative, it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions. Taken together, these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India. The narrative style of Sholay, with its violence, revenge, and vigilante action, is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release. This tension culminated in the Emergency (rule by decree) declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The first {{definite}} {{record of}} his employment is dated 19 April 1477, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> {{that he was a}} singer at the chapel of René, Duke of Anjou, in Aix-en-Provence. He remained there at least until 1478. No certain records of his movements exist for the period from March 1478 until 1483, but if he remained in the employ of René he would have transferred to Paris in 1481 {{along with the rest of}} the chapel. One of Josquin's early motets, Misericordias Domini in aeternum cantabo, suggests a direct connection with Louis XI, who was king during this time. In 1483 Josquin returned to Condé to claim his inheritance from his aunt and uncle, who may have been killed by the army of Louis XI in May 1478, when they besieged the town, locked the population into the church, and burned them alive.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Wade singing and playing his guitar {{in a hotel}} room. While singing, Wade is seen packing his clothes into a suit case in {{separate}} camera shots. He then leaves the hotel room <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> a time-lapse scene of a car going down a highway. Then, the video cuts to a restaurant, where Wade is seen lying on a restaurant booth and singing the lyrics of the song. After this, Wade is seen {{with the rest of}} Lifehouse in a concert setting in a restaurant. It then splits to shots of Wade singing the lyrics of the song to the camera. Toward the end of the video, it switches to Lifehouse playing the song in front of a crowd while showing shots of Wade in a car going down a highway. It ends with the scene of Lifehouse in a restaurant and then switches to a camera shot of all of the band members with the video fading out on Wade.|$|E

40|$|The benzyl-substituted unbridged titanocene bis-[(p-methoxybenzyl) cyclopentadienyl] titanium(IV) {{dichloride}} (Titanocene Y) {{was tested}} in vitro against human renal cancer cells (Caki- 1), in which <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> an IC 50 value of 36 x 10 (- 6) mol/l. Titanocene Y was then given in vivo in doses of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg on 5 consecutive days to Caki- 1 -bearing mice, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> concentration-dependent <b>and</b> statistically significant tumor growth reduction {{with respect to}} a solvent-treated control cohort. The maximum tolerable dose of Titanocene Y was determined to be 40 mg/kg <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> significantly better tumor volume growth reduction than cisplatin given at a dose of 2 mg/kg. This superior activity of Titanocene Y with respect to cisplatin will hopefully lead to clinical tests against metastatic renal cell cancer in the near future...|$|R

25|$|Al-Sinnabra or Sinn en-Nabra, as it {{is known}} in Arabic, was known in the Hellenistic times by the Greek name Sennabris. It was a twin city of Bet Yerah.

25|$|In {{the second}} half of the ninth century, the Slavic dialect spoken north of Thessaloniki, in the hinterlands of Macedonia, became the basis for the first written Slavic language, created by the {{brothers}} Cyril and Methodius who translated portions of the Bible and other church books. The language they recorded is known as Old Church Slavonic. Old Church Slavonic is not identical to Proto-Slavic, having been recorded at least two centuries after the breakup of Proto-Slavic, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> features that clearly distinguish it from Proto-Slavic. However, it is still reasonably close, and the mutual intelligibility between Old Church Slavonic and other Slavic dialects of those days was proved by Cyril and Methodius' mission to Great Moravia and Pannonia. There, their early South Slavic dialect used for the translations was clearly understandable to the local population which spoke an early West Slavic dialect.|$|E
25|$|In Dark Magick Morgan was {{betrayed by}} the first boy she ever loved (Cal). Now Morgan must attempt {{to get on with}} her life. Morgan begins to study with Hunter, and slowly begins to realize her {{feelings}} for him. But dark magick seems to be surrounding them and someone close is to blame. Hunter and Morgan slowly start to get closer throughout the book. Hunter suspects that the dark magick is being used by David Redstone, owner of Practical Magick, and Morgan's friend. Morgan does everything she can to try and prove it was not him, but in the end, Hunter is right. The day before David gets stripped of his powers, Morgan and Hunter share a passionate kiss, and after Hunter strips David of his powers, he gives Morgan the stone Morganite, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> that Morgan is the thing/person that Hunter desires most in his heart.|$|E

25|$|The communion {{table is}} the oldest {{in the state and}} is of {{undoubtedly}} an original feature of this church. It is a walnut table with dimension of 65 inches × 30”. It has baluster-like, robust legs and a bottom rail on all four sides. The molding of the edge of the upper rail is a reversed S (cyma reversa). Reportedly it was used as a chopping block by an American patrol during the War of 1812, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> a documented disregard of the sacerdotal nature of communion tables in early American churches cited by Upton as including: use as a desk for in-church schools, use as a hat table, instances of their being “pushed around carelessly,” going so far that stray dogs stole the communion bread and even urinated on the table legs. Hence, regulations were passed that the table in each church must be located on the east wall and that a protective rail be erected around it. The use of any church as a school, in particular, is puzzling because most colonial vestries scrupulously avoided using the church even for parish business, meeting in a separate vestry house close by a church or in the room formed by bell towers such as at St. Peter’s, New Kent County. The vestry house for this church remained as a ruin just outside the west wall until 1820.|$|E
