2500|$|Following Carver's {{death the}} {{following}} year, William Bradford was made governor. He {{feared that the}} remaining Pilgrims would not survive the hardships of the new land, with half their people having already died within months of arriving. Bradford evoked the symbol of Moses to the weakened and desperate Pilgrims to help calm them and give them hope: [...] "Violence will break all. Where is the meek and humble spirit of Moses?" [...] William G. Dever explains {{the attitude of the}} Pilgrims: [...] "We considered ourselves the 'New Israel,' particularly we in America. And for that reason we knew who we were, what we believed in and valued, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> 'manifest destiny' was." ...|$|E

2500|$|Willis {{is also a}} quilter, also {{incorporating}} photographic images {{into her}} pieces. Daddy's Ties: The Tie Quilt II from 1992 (27 x 34"), for example, is a fabric collage with added button, tie clips, and pins forming [...] "a supple, irregularly shaped memorial." [...] The work references multiple generations and genders, as it elicits memories of fathers teaching their sons, boys maturing into adult clothes and rituals, and women adjusting their husbands' knots. At the same time, however, the artist's cutting and reconfiguration of the ties {{raises the possibility that}} such nostalgic references might be outmoded or rejected. This multivalent collage [...] "also memorializes black soldiers who fought in World War II," [...] since Willis includes photos of soldiers on linen fabric collaged onto the tie fabric. Willis's focus on the African-American experience is evident in Tribute to the Hottentot Venus: Bustle (1995), a fabric and photo linen collage (23 x 28") in a triptych format. Small images of Saartjie Baartman, the so-called [...] "Hottentot Venus," [...] appear in the left and right sections together with pieced fabric silhouettes of her body. The central image in the triptych is of a late 19th-century dress with prominent bustle, its shape emphasizing the buttocks. Willis explains that her use of quilting as a technique [...] "reminds us who we are and who <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> ancestors have been to us in the larger society." ...|$|E

But the demon-driver who had been a road-racer took the 70 h.p.

He shot up a new-made road, more like Mussoorie than ever, and did not fall down the hillside even once. An ammunition-mule of a mountain-battery met him at a tight corner, and began to climb a tree.|$|E

The next chapters were not so interesting; they were full of learned accounts of why we fall asleep, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> brains do in that state, and such like.

6000|$|The rest of {{the book}} of Spiridion is made up of a history of the rise, progress, <b>and</b> (<b>what</b> <b>our</b> philosopher is pleased to call) decay of Christianity--of an assertion, that the [...] "doctrine of Christ is incomplete;" [...] that [...] "Christ may, nevertheless, take his place in the Pantheon of divine men!" [...] and of a long, disgusting, absurd, and impious vision, in which the Saviour, Moses, David, and Elijah are represented, and in which Christ is made to say--"WE ARE ALL MESSIAHS, when we wish to bring the reign of truth upon earth; we are all Christs, when we suffer for it!" ...|$|E
60|$|However, Mr. Henderson came in {{the second}} week of Lent, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> steps towards {{improvement}} introduced would have seemed almost as shocking to you youngsters, as what they displaced. For instance, a plain crimson cloth covered the altar, instead of the rags in the colours of the Winslow livery, presented, according to the queer old register, by the unfortunate Margaret. There was talk of velvet and the gold monogram, surrounded by rays, alternately straight and wavy, as in our London church, but this was voted 'unfit for a plain village church.' Still, the new hangings of pulpit, desk, and altar were all good in quality and colour, and huge square cushions were provided as essential to each. Moreover, the altar vessels were made somewhat more respectable,--all this being at my father's expense.|$|E

Let us thank God that we are here now, and joyfully try to {{understand}} where we are, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> work is here. As for all superstitions about [...] "the good old times," [...] and fancies that they belonged to God, while this age belongs only to man, blind chance, and the evil one, let us cast them from us as the suggestions of an evil lying spirit, as the natural parents of laziness, pedantry, fanaticism, and unbelief. And therefore let us not fear to ask {{the meaning of this}} present day, and of all its different voices--the pressing, noisy, complex present, where our workfield lies, the most intricate of all states of society, and of all schools of literature yet known.|$|E
60|$|These {{houses were}} {{on the shores of}} a chain of ponds, seven in number, the source of a small stream called Herring River, which empties into the Bay. There are many Herring Rivers on the Cape; they will, perhaps, be more {{numerous}} than herrings soon. We knocked {{at the door of the}} first house, but its inhabitants were all gone away. In the meanwhile, we saw the occupants of the next one looking out the window at us, and before we reached it an old woman came out and fastened the door of her bulkhead, and went in again. Nevertheless, we did not hesitate to knock at her door, when a grizzly-looking man appeared, whom we took to be sixty or seventy years old. He asked us, at first, suspiciously, where we were from, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> business was; to which we returned plain answers.|$|E
6000|$|But Stone's usually smooth temper {{seemed to}} be ruffled; he insisted on his own view. [...] "She's impudent and inquisitive, if she is not downright dishonest," [...] he said.

Oh, yes--it's all very well to say she only showed a {{flattering}} interest in us! I suppose she showed a flattering interest in my affairs, when I awoke a little earlier than usual, and caught her in my bedroom with my pocketbook in her hand. Do you believe {{she was going to}} lock it up for safety's sake? She knows how much money we have got as well as we know it ourselves. Every half-penny we have will be in her pocket tomorrow.

"That is {{all true}} enough," [...] Captain Martin agreed; [...] "but our English men have fought {{well on the}} plains of France before now, and I don't believe we should fight worse today. We beat the French when they were ten to one against us over and over, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> fathers did we can do. What you say about the navy is true also. They have a big fleet, {{and we have no}} vessels worth {{speaking}} about, but we are as good sailors as the Spaniards any day, and as good fighters; and though I am not saying we could stop their fleet if it came sailing up the Thames, I believe when they landed we should show them that we were as good men as they. They might bring seventy thousand soldiers, but there would be seven hundred thousand Englishmen to meet; and if we had but sticks and stones to fight with, they would not find that they would have an easy victory." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hanbury's immense dexterities, and incessant labors at Petersburg, shall lie {{hidden in}} the slop-pails: {{it is enough to}} say, his guineas, his dexterities and {{auxiliary}} Poniatowskis did prevail; and he triumphantly signed his Treaty (Petersburg, 30th September) [...] "Subsidy-Treaty for 55,000 men, 15,000 of them cavalry," [...] not to speak of [...] "40 to 50 galleys" [...] and the like; [...] "to attack whomsoever Britannic Majesty bids: annual cost a mere 500,000 pounds while on service; 100,000 pounds while waiting."
