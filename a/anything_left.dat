5|$|Chapter 53 {{begins with}} Gangleri asking {{if any of}} the gods will survive, and if there will be <b>anything</b> <b>left</b> of the earth or the sky. High {{responds}} that the earth will appear once more from the sea, beautiful and green, where self-sown crops grow. The field Iðavöllr exists where Asgard once was, and, there, untouched by Surtr's flames, Víðarr and Váli reside. Now possessing their father's hammer Mjölnir, Thor's sons Móði and Magni will meet them there, and, coming from Hel, Baldr and Höðr also arrive. Together, they all sit and recount memories, later finding the gold game pieces the Æsir once owned. Völuspá stanza 51 is then quoted.|$|E
25|$|The {{war ended}} in May 1945 and after nearly {{twelve years of}} exile, Ewald Munschke {{returned}} in September {{of the same year}} to Berlin, where there was no longer <b>anything</b> <b>left</b> of his parents' house. The eastern part of the city was under Soviet control: Munschke re-registered his Communist Party membership and was almost immediately given a job within the local party organisation before being appointed, in April 1946, to a position as Communist Party Secretary in the Berlin Police. He remained with the Berlin police department till 1949. In the meantime the German Communist Party was abolished later in April 1946 {{as a result of a}} controversial merger with the more moderately left-wing SPD (party). Within the Soviet occupation zone this established the basis for a return to one-party government. Communist Party members, along with those from the SPD, were invited to sign their membership across to the new SED party, and many did so. Ewald Munschke's own SED Party membership card is dated 1 May 1946. He took a position in the new party's Berlin regional leadership team, later during the decade becoming head of the important personnel department (Kaderabteiling).|$|E
25|$|Occasionally an aristocrat of {{the first}} rank did find himself in dire {{financial}} troubles. The severely impoverished Duke of Marlborough saved Blenheim Palace by marrying an heiress, tempted from the USA by the lure of an old title in return for vast riches. Not all were so fortunate or seemingly eligible. When 2nd Duke of Buckingham found himself bankrupt in 1848, he sold the contents of Stowe House, one of Britain's grandest houses. It {{proved to be a}} temporary solution; his heirs, the 3rd and final Duke of Buckingham and his heirs, the Earls Temple, inherited huge financial problems until finally in 1922 <b>anything</b> <b>left</b> that was moveable, both internal and external, was auctioned off and the house sold, narrowly escaping demolition. It was saved by being transformed into a school. Less fortunate was Clumber Park, the principal home of the Dukes of Newcastle. Selling the Hope diamond and other properties failed to solve the family problems, leaving no alternative but demolition of the huge, expensive-to-maintain house, which was razed to the ground in 1938, leaving the Duke without a ducal seat. Plans to rebuild a smaller house on the site were never executed. Other high-ranking members of the peerage were also forced to off-load minor estates and seats; the Duke of Northumberland retained Alnwick Castle, but sold Stanwick Park to be demolished, leaving him with four other country seats remaining. Likewise the Duke of Bedford kept Woburn Abbey, considerably reduced in size, after World War II, while selling other family estates and houses. Whatever the personal choices and reasons for the sales and demolitions, the underlying and unifying factor was almost always financial. The root of the problem began long before the 20th century with the gradual introduction and increase of taxes on income and further tax on inherited wealth, death duties.|$|E

50|$|Greenham's Workes were {{collected}} and edited by H.H., i.e. Henry Holland, in 1599; a second edition {{appeared in the}} same year; the third edition was 1601, reprinted 1605 and 1612 ('fift and last' edition). 'A Garden of Spiritual Flowers,' by Greenham, was published 1612, and several times reprinted, till 1687. It is doubtful whether Greenham himself published <b>anything,</b> or <b>left</b> <b>anything</b> ready for the press.|$|R

500|$|Meanwhile, as a {{consequence}} of the FBI investigation, former Travel Office Director Billy Dale was indicted by a federal grand jury on December 7, 1994, on two counts of embezzlement and criminal conversion, charged with wrongfully depositing into his own bank account $68,000 in checks from media organizations traveling with the president during the period between 1988 and 1991. [...] He faced up to 20years in prison if convicted. [...] Dale's attorneys conceded that funds had been co-mingled, but stated that Dale had not stolen anything but rather used the monies for the substantial tips and off-the-book payments that the job required, especially in foreign countries, and that <b>anything</b> <b>left</b> over was used as a discount against future trips.|$|E
500|$|Adult coconut crabs feed on fruits, nuts, seeds, and the pith {{of fallen}} trees, but will eat carrion and other organic matter opportunistically. <b>Anything</b> <b>left</b> {{unattended}} {{on the ground}} is a potential source of food which they will investigate and may carry away - thereby getting the alternative name of [...] "Robber crab." [...] The species is popularly associated with the coconut palm, yet coconuts are not a significant part of its diet. Although it lives in a burrow the crab has been filmed climbing coconut and pandanus trees. There is no film showing a crab selectively picking coconut fruit, though they might dislodge ripe fruit that otherwise would fall naturally. [...] Climbing is an immediate escape route (if too far from the burrow) to avoid predation (when young) by large sea birds, or cannibalism (at any age) by bigger, older crabs.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} in 2007 when asked about politics he said, [...] "I'd been unemployed all my life. It {{was a big deal}} for me when they (Labour) got in. Now David Cameron is no different from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown is no different from David Cameron. They're all cut from the same cloth and it annoys me that the biggest political icon in the last 30 years has been Margaret Thatcher. Someone who tried to destroy the working class. It freaks me out. So I don't really think there's <b>anything</b> <b>left</b> to vote for. I believe that I, as a person, can only change things once every 5 years and that's by voting, and my point is that even casting that vote means that the same guy gets in, the only difference is one has a red tie and the other has a blue one." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{week before}} the tour began, Spears said of the show: [...] "I come from Broadway, so I {{want it to be}} very theatrical. The whole process for me is magical. Hopefully it will be {{something}} people have never even imagined or envisioned in their head. I was going through a run-through yesterday and was thinking, 'By the time I'm 30, there's not going to be <b>anything</b> <b>left</b> for me to do'". Initial rehearsals for the band started on September 9, 2001. She joined them later after rehearsing the choreography in Los Angeles. [...] The setlist was composed mostly by songs from Britney. She explained her decision in a press conference, saying, [...] "I just want my fans to see me in a different light than they have ever seen me [...] before. This music I am singing right now is such a reflection of me and who I am. Hopefully [...] will come to the show and be inspired and have a lot of fun." [...] Several songs from her previous albums ...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again were remixed by Robson to [...] "take [...] in a new direction– flip [...] up a bit".|$|E
500|$|The serial later {{played out}} another chance for Ivan and Paul to be together. While interviewed by Claire Brand from Inside Soap, Bose said that Paul visits Ivan {{to give him}} back a CD he left over his house and [...] "both of them realise that they don't have <b>anything</b> <b>left</b> {{to say to each}} other." [...] Bose opined that Ivan and Paul were [...] "doomed from the start" [...] because he needed Ivan to commit. Rodney thinks that he can reunite Paul and Ivan and sets the pair up. He {{explained}} that the two had [...] "just about got over their awkwardness with one another" [...] and Rodney tells the whole pub that it is obvious that Paul and Ivan love each other and need to reconcile. The whole situation is [...] "embarrassing for both of them" [...] and Ivan is furious with Rodney's intervention. After some [...] "soul searching", Ivan calms down and [...] "stuns" [...] Paul when he asks him to get back with him. Paul rejects Ivan's advances, Bose said that Paul normally likes [...] "the big love affair" [...] but this time gives him his [...] "marching orders". Ivan is left heartbroken once again and decides to take some time away from the village. Bose stated that his character goes to see him off and there is a [...] "terrible silent moment" [...] between the two. He concluded that the audience could clearly see that Ivan and Paul were [...] "kicking themselves" [...] for not saying how they really feel.|$|E

500|$|... "Valley Girls" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{comments from}} reviewers. TV Guides Jennifer Sankowski enjoyed the episode and believed the producers had captured {{all aspects of}} popular 1980s teen culture well, but that [...] "at times it {{felt like they were}} trying too hard, throwing everything and anything '80s at us" [...] such as a montage of 1980s outfits worn by Lily and mentions of MTV videos, fanny packs, Rubik's Cube, and Jane Fonda workout videos. [...] "At this rate," [...] said Sankowski, [...] "they won't have <b>anything</b> <b>left</b> to showcase." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly [...] "loved" [...] the episode and complimented the casting choices, but agrees with Sankowski in that [...] "if this ends up being an actual series, they need to dial down the '80s references a tad." [...] Kona Gallagher of Cinema Blend said the premise was interesting and that [...] " [...] {{has the potential to be}} a strong spinoff, and [...] hope that CW decides to pick it up this fall." [...] Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times writes that he [...] "especially liked the moxie of Brittany Snow as young Lily and Krysten Ritter [...] as her sister, Carol. And of course the retro soundtrack was a total trip." [...] A few review sites took issue with the episode's script, such as BuddyTV, which claimed it was cliché, and Television Without Pity, which found it repetitive. While writing for The Frisky, Sara Benincasa praised the clothing styles and called the overall episode [...] "awesome fun! [...] weirdly sentimental, and sweet". She also believed that the confrontation between the Valley dwellers and the rich attendees of Keith's party was [...] "clearly a giant, dance-friendly metaphor for Reaganomics and the woes of a trickle-down world." [...] Michelle Graham for Film School Rejects liked both the 1980s and present day scenes separately, but when put together, [...] "the overall effect was disjointed and showed it for what it was: an attempt to shove two shows together in order to save money on a proper pilot." ...|$|E

2500|$|By December 25, 1901, {{nearly the}} entire populations of Batangas and Laguna provinces had {{gathered}} into the reconcentrados. Families had to bring everything they could carry because <b>anything</b> <b>left</b> behind—including houses, gardens, carts, poultry and animals—was subject to confiscation or destruction by the U.S. Army. The reconcentrados were overcrowded, which led to disease and death. [...] "One camp was two miles by one mile in area and 'home' to some 8,000 Filipinos. Between January and April 1902, 8,350 prisoners of approximately 298,000 died, and some camps experienced mortality rates as high as 20 percent.|$|E

During this time, Double Trouble began rehearsals for the Live Alive tour. Although Vaughan was nervous about performing after achieving sobriety, he received positive reassurance. Wynans later recalled: [...] "Stevie was real worried about playing after he'd gotten sober...he didn't know if he had <b>anything</b> <b>left</b> to offer. Once we got back out on the road, he was very inspired and motivated." [...] The tour began on November 23 at Towson State University, which was Vaughan's first performance with Double Trouble after rehab.
