Suddenly, <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> bursts out, which Bart rides {{a basketball}} hoop on having flooded the gym, drenching the school yard and saving Ned. Furious at the mess Bart made, Skinner has Homer and Marge {{come to the}} school, where they learn Bart has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Principal Skinner tells Marge and Homer that Bart must take a radical, untested new behavioral medicine called Focusyn or {{he will have to}} expel him.|$|E
5|$|On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard {{joined the}} strike, under the {{leadership}} of Marian Jurczyk. <b>A</b> <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of the strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes). More and more new unions were formed, and joined the federation.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, the Japanese Army became {{interested}} in supercharger-engined fighters and in 1926 the prototype HD.15 was sold and delivered to them. An order for three more followed, but the ship taking them to Japan was sunk by <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> en voyage.|$|E

25|$|Paintings of the {{submersion}} of Atlantis are comparatively rare. In {{the seventeenth}} century there was François de Nomé’s “The Fall of Atlantis”, which shows <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> surging toward a Baroque city frontage. The style of architecture apart, it is not very different from Nicholas Roerich’s “The Last of Atlantis” of 1928.|$|E
25|$|The {{firepower}} of {{the garrison}} under Lourenço de Brito {{allowed it to}} repulse massive attacks involving thousands of men. The siege soon entered a stalemate, with the Malabari trenches being protected from Portuguese cannon fire by walls of cotton bales, and the Portuguese being slowly forced into starvation. Castanheda's detailed report of the siege states that they were then surprised - and saved - by <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> of lobsters that washed ashore on 15 August. A major assault before the Onam festival nearly overcame the defenders, but was eventually repulsed. However, {{a large part of}} the garrison was wounded in the attempt.|$|E
5000|$|In oceanography, <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> {{resonance}} {{occurs when}} the tide excites one of the resonant modes of the ocean. [...] The effect is most striking when a continental shelf is about a quarter wavelength wide. Then <b>an</b> incident <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> can be reinforced by reflections between the coast and the shelf edge, the result producing <b>a</b> much higher <b>tidal</b> range at the coast.|$|R

25|$|Instead, Basildon is {{remarkable}} and notable for its survival {{against all odds}} in the 20th century. At {{a time when it}} was near ruin and its destruction seemed inevitable, it was saved. Since 1900, over 1,000 country houses, many of far greater architectural importance than Basildon, have been demolished. The destruction of many of these houses began as a trickle just prior to World War I, but became <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> in 1955, when one house was demolished every five days. The destruction did not halt until 1975, by which time the Iliffe's restoration work at Basildon was almost completed.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} a major {{character}} in the original season of the animated television series Super Friends (1973). In this series, Aquaman was shown to display superstrength—hefting a bulldozer blade over his head, for example, and using it to help stop <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> <b>wave.</b> He also had encyclopedic knowledge of oceanography and oceanology, {{in addition to his}} more familiar water-breathing power and aquatic telepathy. However, this series has been blamed for making Aquaman unpopular, and even laughable, by reinforcing a weak image of the character. In the first two seasons of Super Friends, he was voiced by Norman Alden, {{and for the rest of}} the series he was voiced by Bill Callaway.|$|E
25|$|UMP {{candidate}} Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining {{two seats}} in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front Gérard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% {{in the first round}} and 53.59% in the second round.|$|E

A photograph of Paley with a scarf tied to her handbag, for example, created <b>a</b> trendy <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> {{that millions of}} women emulated. She often mixed extravagant jewelry by Fulco di Verdura and Jean Schlumberger with inexpensive costume pieces, and embraced letting her hair go gray instead of camouflaging it with dye.|$|R

500|$|In 2002, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{added the}} storm surge from the {{hurricane}} to the Global Tsunami Database based on newspaper reports referring to the event as <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> <b>wave.</b> However, four years later, a more detailed study of possible tsunamis in the past resulted in this event being [...] "flagged" [...] as suspect. After further review of the news articles indicating that the wave came after the hurricane, {{it was determined that}} there was a misinterpretation of the publishing date since the article was archived by telegraph on September22, 1909, the day after the hurricane made landfall. In light of this research, the possibility of the wave being a tsunami was denied; however, it remains in the database as a [...] "debunked" [...] event.|$|E
500|$|Music historians Schinder and Schwartz {{wrote of}} the {{transformation}} in popular music styles that took place between the 1950s and the 1960s. They said that the Beatles' influence cannot be overstated: having [...] "revolutionised the sound, style, and attitude of popular music and opened rock and roll's doors to <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> of British rock acts", the group then [...] "spent {{the rest of the}} 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers". Liam Gallagher and his group Oasis were among the many who acknowledged the band's influence; he identified Lennon as a hero. In 1999, he named his first child Lennon Gallagher in tribute. On National Poetry Day in 1999, the BBC conducted a poll to identify the UK's favourite song lyric and announced [...] "Imagine" [...] as the winner.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Cat has uneasy {{feelings}} and consults her I Ching. It warns her {{to pack up}} and leave town as well as beware of hurricane Cha Cha. She dismisses the warning as ludicrous.

50|$|The {{interiors}} and {{the exterior}} of the condominium were duplicated in miniature size for the hurricane scenes. To get the realistic effect of <b>a</b> hurricane <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> crashing into the condominium, a sixty-man crew at Universal Studios' Soundstage 27 created an 8-foot high replica of the actual Florida condominium, complete with swimming pool. The <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> effect called for 10 wind machines, six wave-makers and four dump tanks that unleashed 80 tons of water down three chutes.|$|R
500|$|In 2005 {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> of new wizard rock bands. The {{brothers}} do-it-yourself musical ethos has caught on with bands forming as fellow Potter fans {{are picking up}} instruments for the first time. Like Harry and the Potters, these new bands also take on the persona, or dress as a Harry Potter-themed character. Though most fans of the music are previous fans of Harry Potter, some bands have attracted listeners outside of the Harry Potter fanbase. Paul and Joe are aware of around 200 other Harry Potter-related rock bands who at least record and post songs on the Internet. The Boston Phoenix wondered—in spite of fully booked calendars—how long wizard rock would last once there are no new stories to riff on, as their musical identity is contingent on the lasting success and popularity of a book series. [...] "In some ways," [...] said Paul, [...] "we want to tie things off and consider it a done deal. We’ve always viewed this as a project that had a finite life and end point." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Brown singing {{alone in a}} desert {{in front of a}} sunset backdrop. It then cuts to Brown waking up in a bedroom as he notices a mysterious woman (played by Araya Nicks) walking through the first of three doors behind him. Each door is labeled with hieroglyphics in gold. During the first chorus, Brown follows the woman through the door and enters a garden maze. This scene is intercut with scenes of Brown singing in the desert. He then returns to bed as the woman walks through the second door. Brown follows her again and appears in a city in the sky. This scene is also intercut with scenes of him in the desert. During the second chorus, Brown is hit by <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> which sends him back to bed. He then enters the third door and appears driving a vintage car in the desert. Brown drives after the woman until he hits a sign that reads [...] "Road Closed", which causes him to drive off a cliff. The video then cuts to Brown and the woman lying in bed with {{electrodes}} attached to their heads.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Lundgren {{starred in}} The Last Warrior as Captain Nick Preston under {{director}} Sheldon Lettich. This post apocalyptic movie {{is set in}} 2006 {{in the context of}} a 9.5-magnitude earthquake which kills millions of people, with Preston leading a motley military patrol on the island to help survivors in the pole shift-affected world. The film was partly shot in Eilat, Israel. Later in 2000, Dolph appeared in Damian Lee's Agent Red (also known as Captured), alongside Alexander Kuznetsov, Natalie Radford and Randolph Mantooth. The film is set during the Cold War, and is about two soldiers trapped on a submarine with a group of terrorists who plan to use a chemical weapon against the United States. Lundgren's character, Matt Hendricks, must work with his wife, a virologist, to prevent the scenario occurring. After the film was completed, producer Andrew Stevens thought it was too poor to be released and multiple people had to be hired to at least make the film half-competent. The film was very poorly received, given its [...] "shoestring budget"; the DVD and Film Guide of 2005 wrote, [...] "low-budget mess stars Dolph Lundgren as a navy special operations commander trying to keep a deadly virus out of the hands of terrorists. This subpar effort sinks to the bottom of the ocean in <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> of cliche." [...] During an interview on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in May 2008, Gladiator director Ridley Scott said Lundgren had been considered for the part of undefeated fighter Tigris of Gaul in 2000, but was eventually rejected because [...] "as an actor, he just didn't fit in with what we were trying to achieve".|$|E

500|$|... "Judas" [...] was {{generally}} well received by most music critics. Jonathan Van Meter from Vogue gave the song a positive review, saying the song sounded {{like it was}} written for The Ronettes, but was set to a [...] "sledgehammering" [...] dance beat. MTV's James Dinh noted that the song was very similar in its composition to [...] "Bad Romance". Popjustice also compared it to [...] "Bad Romance" [...] describing it as [...] "a highly evolved, Titanium-plated 'Bad Romance' from the year 2511 travelling half a millennium {{back in time to}} save music from <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> of 'in the club'-obsessed pop drivel, and that's 'Judas'." [...] Kevin O'Donnel from Spin felt that the song sounded like a rowdy, industrial-disco banger, and described Gaga's performance as [...] "insanely over the top: She alternates between rapping, a robotic monotone, and a crow-like squawk — before gliding into a more conventional chorus that hews closer to 'Bad Romance'." [...] He complimented the primal energy of the music of [...] "Judas," [...] and felt that the breakdown was one of the weirdest moments to hit the pop music scene in 2011. Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson noted that the disconnection and deviation from Gaga's previous single [...] "Born This Way" [...] was more pronounced with [...] "Judas". Musically he felt that [...] "Judas" [...] had the same [...] "glitter-jackhammer level as 'Born This Way', though the big anthemic chords are almost inverted—not unlike Inner City's Big Fun vs. Good Life. It's a good twin, evil twin thing." [...] Henderson continued that the song conjured the imagery of a disturbed vision of hell, and in a warped sense the song seemed more forward-thinking to him and less of a message, [...] "than the 'gay = great' equation at the heart of 'Born This Way'." ...|$|E
