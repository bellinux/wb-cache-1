5|$|Although the cheetah is an African cat, {{molecular}} {{evidence indicates}} that the three species of the Puma lineage evolved in North America two to three million years ago, where they possibly had a common ancestor during the Miocene. They possibly diverged from this ancestor 8.25 million years ago. The cheetah diverged from the puma and the jaguarundi around 6.7 million years ago. A genome study concluded that cheetahs experienced two genetic bottlenecks in their history, the first about 100,000 years ago and the second about 12,000 years ago, greatly lowering their genetic variability. These bottlenecks may {{have been associated with}} migrations across Asia and into <b>Africa</b> (<b>with</b> the current African population founded about 12,000 years ago), and/or with a depletion of prey species {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|An avid {{conservationist}} and hunter, Burnham {{supported the}} early conservation programs {{of his friends}} Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot.

Burnham, Hammond, and Duquesne appeared several times before the House Committee on Agriculture {{to ask for help}} in importing large African animals. In 1914, he helped establish the Wild Life Protective League of America, Department of Southern California, and served as its first Secretary.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{lesson from the}} Tunisia Campaign was that neuropsychiatric casualties had {{to be treated as}} soon as possible and not evacuated from the combat zone. This was not done {{in the early stages of}} the Sicilian Campaign, and large numbers of neuropsychiatric casualties were evacuated to North <b>Africa,</b> <b>with</b> the result that treatment became complicated and only 15 percent of them were returned to duty.

5|$|As {{the museum}} {{moved to the}} National Mall in the mid 1980s, its {{permanent}} collection consisted of more than 6,000 art objects (e.g., sculpture, artifacts, textiles) and the large Elisofon photography collection. This original collection focused on Sub-Saharan <b>Africa,</b> <b>with</b> better representation of the Guinea coast and Western Sudan than the Central African region. The collection is idiosyncratic, reflecting the relative lack of colonial era African art acquisitions in American donor collections. Some early highlights of the museum's collection include an Edo–Portuguese ivory spoon and an Akan gold pendant bequeathed by the Robert Woods Bliss estate. The museum's first acquisitions budget came with joining the Smithsonian.|$|E

Over the next two decades, Boyce led expeditions to South America, Europe, and North Africa, where he visited the newly discovered tomb of King Tutankhamun.|$|E
