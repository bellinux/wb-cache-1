Two years long data sets including aerosol and meteorological parameters as well as modeled backward trajectories and boundary layer heights were compared. The purpose was to see how <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations</b> vary between clean and polluted sites not very far from each other. Specifically, we were exploring the effect of boundary layer evolution on <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The measurements showed that especially during the coldest winter months, <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations</b> are significantly lower in Mukteshwar. On the other hand, the difference is smaller and also the concentration trends are quite similar from April to October. With the exception of the monsoon season, when rains are affecting on <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations,</b> clear but practically opposite diurnal cycles are observed. When the lowest daily <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations</b> are seen during afternoon hours in Gual Pahari, there is a peak in Mukteshwar <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations.</b> In addition to local sources and long-range transport of dust, boundary layer dynamics can explain the observed differences and similarities. When mixing of air masses is limited during the relatively cool winter months, aerosol pollutions are accumulated to the plains, but Mukteshwar is above the pollution layer. When mixing increases in the spring, <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations</b> are increased in Mukteshwar and decreased in Gual Pahari.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{trends in}} <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations</b> observed by the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) {{network in the}} wilderness areas along the Gulf of Alaska during low insolation periods and in Denali National Park and Preserve (Denali NP) during high insolation periods have raised the concerns about air quality degradation and visibility impairment in these pristine areas. This dissertation aims to investigate the reason for those observed increases in <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations</b> in Alaska wilderness areas by performing a series of simulation sets with the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). These simulation sets use the same meteorological conditions but change the emission scenarios. The model evaluation analysis showed that WRF-Chem performed well in simulating meteorological conditions over Alaska and the North Pacific under both low and high insolation conditions. Performance skill-scores of the WRF-Chem model in simulating <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations</b> for the coastal monitoring sites along the Gulf of Alaska were consistent with state-of-the-science air-quality model performance. During low insolation periods, domestic and international ship emissions {{were the most important}} contributors to <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the coastal regions along the Gulf of Alaska. The increases/decreases in ship emissions led to subsequent increases/decreases in <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the coastal areas along the Gulf of Alaska during low insolation periods. During high insolation periods, in Interior Alaska, the contributions of local wildfire emissions to <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations</b> were notable even during the weak Alaska fire activity scenario. Under the strong Alaska fire activity scenario, local wildfire emissions were the dominant source of aerosols in Interior Alaska. The increases in Alaskan wildfire emissions led to significant increases in <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations</b> in Interior Alaska. During both low and high insolation periods, Japanese anthropogenic and Siberian wildfire emissions were not important contributors to total <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations</b> in all regions of Alaska. Overall in the wilderness areas along the Gulf of Alaska, the increases in <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations</b> observed during low insolation periods stemmed from increases in domestic and international ship emissions in the North Pacific. In contrast, the increases in <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations</b> observed at Denali NP during high insolation periods stemmed from increases in Alaskan wildfire emissions...|$|R

The SAGE II (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II) sensor was {{launched into a}} 57 degree inclination orbit aboard the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) in October 1984. During each sunrise and sunset encountered by the orbiting spacecraft, the instrument uses the solar occultation technique to measure attenuated solar radiation through the Earth's limb in seven channels centered at wavelengths ranging from 0.385 to 1.02 micrometers. The retrieval of stratospheric aerosol size distributions based on HALOE multi-wavelength particle extinction measurements was described by Hervig et al. 1998. That approach yields unimodal lognormal size distributions, which describe the <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentration</b> versus radius using three parameters: total <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentration,</b> median radius, and distribution width. This site offers results based on the Hervig et al. 1998 technique, with one exception. The retrieval results reported here are based on sulfate refractive indices for 215 K, where Hervig et al. 1998 used room temperature indices adjusted to stratospheric temperatures using the Lorentz-Lorenz rule. Size distributions were only retrieved at altitudes above tropospheric cloud tops. Clouds were identified using techniques described by Hervig and McHugh 1999. The HALOE size distributions are offered in NetCDF files containing data for a single year. The results are reported on a uniform altitude grid ranging from 6 to 33 km at 0.3 km spacing. The native HALOE altitude spacing is 0.3 km, so this interpolation {{has little or no}} effect on the data. The files report profile data including: altitude, pressure, temperature, <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentration,</b> median radius, distribution width, aerosol composition. Aerosol surface area and volume densities can be easily calculated from the size distribution parameters using the relationships given here.|$|E

A ceilometer is a device that uses a laser or other light source to determine the height of a cloud base. Ceilometers {{can also be used to}} measure the <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentration</b> within the atmosphere. A ceiling balloon is used by meteorologists to determine the height of the base of clouds above ground level during daylight hours. The principle behind the ceiling balloon is a balloon with a known ascent rate (how fast it climbs) and determining how long the balloon rises until it disappears into the cloud. Ascent rate times ascent time yields the ceiling height. A disdrometer is an instrument used to measure the drop size distribution and velocity of falling hydrometeors. Rain gauges are used to measure the precipitation which falls at any point on the Earth's landmass.|$|E
40|$|The {{impacts of}} urban-enhanced <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations</b> on {{convective}} storm development and precipita-tion over and downwind of St. Louis, Missouri, are investigated. This is achieved {{through the use}} of a cloud-resolving mesoscale model, in which sophisticated land use processes and aerosol microphysics are both incorporated. The results indicate that urban-forced convergence downwind of the city, rather than the presence of greater <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations,</b> determines whether storms actually develop in the downwind region. Once convection is initiated, urban-enhanced aerosols can exert a significant effect on the dynamics, microphysics, and precipitation produced by these storms. The model results indicate, however, that the response to urban-enhanced aerosol depends on the background concentrations of aerosols; a weaker response occurs with increasing background <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The effects of aerosols influence the rate and amount of liquid water and ice produced within these storms, the accumulated surface precipita-tion, the strength and timing of the updrafts and downdrafts, the longevity of the updrafts, and the strength and influence of the cold pool. Complex, nonlinear relationships and feedbacks between the microphysics and storm dynamics exist, making it difficult to make definitive statements about the effects of urban-enhanced aerosols on downwind precipitation and convection. Because the impacts of urban aerosol on downwind storms decrease with increasing background <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations,</b> generalization of these results depends on the unique character of background aerosol for each urban area. For urban centers in coastal areas where background <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations</b> may be very low, it is speculated that urban aerosol can have very large influences on convective storm dynamics, microphysics, and precipitation. 1...|$|R
40|$|The aerosol–cloud {{interaction}} {{over the}} Tibetan Plateau {{has been investigated}} using a cloud-resolving weather research and forecasting model with a two-moment bulk microphysical scheme including aerosol effects on cloud condensation nuclei and ice nuclei. Two types of cumulus clouds with a similar convective available potential energy, occurring over the Tibetan Plateau (Cu-TP) and North China Plain (Cu-NCP) in August  2014, are simulated to explore the response of convective clouds to aerosols. A set of aerosol profiles {{is used in the}} simulations, with the surface <b>aerosol</b> number <b>concentration</b> varying from 20  to 9000  cm − 3 and the sulfate mass concentration varying from 0. 02  to 9. 0  µg cm − 3. Increasing <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations</b> generally enhances the cloud core updraft and maximum updraft, intensifying convections in Cu-TP and Cu-NCP. However, the core updraft is much stronger in Cu-TP than Cu-NCP, because of the early occurrence of the glaciation process in Cu-TP that is triggered at an elevation above 4000  m. The precipitation increases steadily with <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations</b> in Cu-NCP, caused by the suppression of the warm rain but occurrence of efficient mix-phased precipitation due to the reduced cloud droplet size. The precipitation in Cu-TP also increases with <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations,</b> but the precipitation enhancement is not substantial compared to that in Cu-NCP with high <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The aerosol-induced intensification of convections in Cu-TP not only facilitates the precipitation but also transports more ice-phase hydrometeors into the upper troposphere to decrease the precipitation efficiency. Considering the very clean atmosphere over the Tibetan Plateau, elevated <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentrations</b> can remarkably enhance convections due to its specific topography, which not only warms the middle troposphere to influence the Asian summer monsoon but also delivers hydrometeors into the upper troposphere to allow more water vapor to travel into the lower stratosphere...|$|R

40|$|Balloon {{measurements}} of aerosols {{have been made}} in the winter and spring of 1985 to investigate the behavior of the antarctic stratospheric aerosols. Number concentration and the size distribution of aerosol particles with diameter greater than 0. 3 μm were measured by using a light scattering aerosol particle counter. The vertical distributions of the number concentration were obtained up to about 18 km on July 21 and about 17 km on October 8, 1985. Compared with the result on June 3, 1983,the stratospheric <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentration</b> on July 21, 1985 decreased by a factor of three. This indicates that the higher <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentration</b> on June 3, 1983 reflects both the effect of El Chichon eruption and winter increase of <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentration.</b> On the other hand, the high <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentration</b> on July 21, 1985 reveals a regular seasonal variation having a remarkable winter maximum. The difference in the stratospheric <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentration</b> between the two winter measurements can be attributed to the aftereffect of El Chichon eruption. An extensive aerosol layer was also observed in the measurement on October 8, 1985. The concentration was about three times higher than that usually appeared during the low volcanic period in the summer season. The high <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentration</b> cannot be attributed to the aftereffect of El Chichon eruption.

Simulations carried out using different aerosol loadings show that an increase in aerosol loading leads to a decrease in the total mass of hail but also to a substantial increase in the maximum size of hailstones. Cumulative rain strongly increases with an increase in <b>aerosol</b> <b>concentration</b> from 100 to about 1000 cm(- 3). At higher cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations, the sensitivity of hailstones' size and surface precipitation to aerosols decreases. The physical mechanism of these effects was analyzed.

In the laboratory, a room-temperature gas optionally containing zinc chloride particles is continuously mixed with a high-temperature gas saturated with dibutyl phthalate (DBP) vapor in a previously discussed device {{for the study of}} aerosol nucleation known as a particle size magnifier (PSM). A highly supersaturated vapor is rapidly formed in the mixing zone of the PSM, and gas-to-particle conversion ensues. The vapor may be converted to the aerosol phase by condensation onto the preexisting particles or by homogeneous nucleation to form new particles which then serve as condensation sites themselves.
