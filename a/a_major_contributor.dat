5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, but most adults from the earlier {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus likely to be <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E

5|$|The exhaust can {{be transported}} to the Arctic region in little over a day, {{although}} the exact mechanism of this very high-speed transport is unknown. As the water migrates northward, it falls from the thermosphere down into the colder mesosphere, which occupies {{the region of the}} atmosphere just below. Although this mechanism is the cause of individual noctilucent clouds, it is not thought to be <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> to the phenomenon as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Two major {{protactinium}} isotopes, 231Pa and 233Pa, {{are produced}} from thorium in nuclear reactors; both are undesirable {{and are usually}} removed, thereby adding complexity to the reactor design and operation. In particular, 232Th via (n,2n) reactions produces 231Th which quickly (half-life 25.5 hours) decays to 231Pa. The last isotope, while not a transuranic waste, has a long half-life of 32,760 years and is <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> to the long term radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel.|$|E
