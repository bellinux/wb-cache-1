5|$|Clarinet {{bodies have}} been made {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including wood, plastic, hard rubber, metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of clarinets used by professionals are made from African hardwood, mpingo (<b>African</b> <b>Blackwood)</b> or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) Honduran rosewood and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were used. Most inexpensive clarinets are made of plastic resin, such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them; metal construction is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass clarinets and the necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger clarinets. Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well. Buffet Crampon's Greenline clarinets are made from a composite of grenadilla wood powder and carbon fiber. Such clarinets are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. Hard rubber, such as ebonite, has been used for clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it. Clarinet designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber. Hanson Clarinets of England manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite, known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla. This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is {{the same as that of}} a wooden clarinet.|$|E
25|$|The Western concert flute, a {{descendant}} of the medieval German flute, is a transverse treble flute that is closed at the top. An embouchure hole is positioned near the top across and into which the flutist blows. The flute has circular tone holes larger than the finger holes of its baroque predecessors. The size and placement of tone holes, key mechanism, and fingering system used to produce the notes in the flute's range were evolved from 1832 to 1847 by Theobald Boehm and greatly improved the instrument's dynamic range and intonation over its predecessors. With some refinements (and the rare exception of the Kingma system and other custom adapted fingering systems), Western concert flutes typically conform to Boehm's design, known as the Boehm system. Beginner's flutes are made of nickel, silver, or brass that is silver-plated, while professionals use solid silver, gold, and sometimes platinum flutes. There are also modern wooden-bodied flutes usually with silver or gold keywork. The wood is usually <b>African</b> <b>Blackwood.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Less {{expensive}} flutes {{are usually}} constructed of brass, polished and then silver-plated and lacquered to prevent corrosion or silver-plated nickel silver (nickel-bronze bell metal, 63% Cu, 29% Zn, 5.5% Ni, 1.25% Ag, [...]75% Pb, alloyed As, Sb, Fe, Sn). Flutes {{that are more}} expensive are usually made of more precious metals, most commonly solid sterling silver (92.5% silver), and other alloys including French silver (95% silver, 5% copper), [...] "coin silver" [...] (90% silver), or Britannia silver (95.8% silver). It is reported that old Louis Lot French flutes have a particular sound by nature of their specific silver alloy. [...] Gold/silver flutes are even more expensive. They can be either gold {{on the inside and}} silver on the outside, or vice versa. All-gold and all-platinum flutes also exist. Flutes can also be made out of wood, with <b>African</b> <b>blackwood</b> (grenadilla or Dalbergia melanoxylon) being the most common today. Formerly cocuswood was used but this is hard to obtain today. Wooden flutes were far more common before the early 20th century. The silver flute was introduced by Boehm in 1847, but did not become common until later in the 20th century. Wm.S.Haynes, a flute manufacturer in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, told Georges Barrère that in 1905 he made one silver flute to every 100 wooden flutes, but in the 1930s, he made one wooden flute to every 100 silver flutes.|$|E

50|$|It is {{available}} only in small sizes (it is yielded by a smallish tree, Dalbergia cearensis, restricted to a small area in Brazil). Other woods yielded by the same genus are cocobolo, rosewood, <b>African</b> <b>blackwood,</b> Bombay blackwood and tulipwood.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{increasingly}} {{being used in}} the construction of musical instruments, particularly woodwind. Suitable quality <b>African</b> <b>blackwood</b> (Dalbergia melanoxylon), traditionally used for clarinets, is becoming harder to find. Mopane is fairly oily, seasons very well with few splits or shakes, and produces instruments of a warm, rich tone.|$|E
50|$|Cutaneous {{disorders}} in musicians include frictional injury ("fiddler's neck"), hyperhidrosis, acne mechanica and vascular compromise. Other agents of irritant and {{allergic contact dermatitis}} may be rosewood, Makassar ebony, cocobolo wood, <b>African</b> <b>blackwood,</b> nickel, reed, propolis (bee glue), chromium and paraphenylenediamine. Patch testing can be performed for identification of the cause.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{makers of}} oboes d'amore include Howarth of London ({{instruments}} in <b>African</b> <b>Blackwood</b> or Cocobolo wood), F. Lorée in Paris (instruments in <b>African</b> <b>Blackwood</b> or Violetwood) and others such as French makers Rigoutat, Fossati and Marigaux, Italian maker Bulgheroni (who offer instruments in Grenadilla, Violetwood, Cocobolo, Rosewood, Palisander, and Cocus wood), Japanese maker Joseph and German makers Püchner, Mönnig and Ludwig Franck. New instruments cost approximately £8,250 at 2016 prices (roughly $11,885 US), {{comparable to the}} cost of a new cor anglais. This cost, coupled with the limited call for the instrument, leads many oboists not to possess their own , but to rent one when their work dictates the need. For the same reason, however, second-hand oboes d'amore surface from time to time with very little wear (and yet with very little reduction in price over a new instrument).|$|E
50|$|In May 2010, Hanson Clarinet {{has been}} awarded the world’s first Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) Chain of Custody (CoC) {{certificate}} for using <b>African</b> <b>Blackwood</b> in its products.

Hanson Clarinets will be launching the world’s first FSC-certified clarinets by late 2010.|$|E
50|$|Even outside {{protected}} areas the woodlands have remained comparatively intact {{due to the}} sparse human population. However the woodlands are being slowly cleared for farmland and pasture throughout. There is little commercial logging except for the <b>African</b> <b>blackwood</b> (Dalbergia melanoxylon), whose timber is highly valuable.

50|$|Not {{all species}} in the large genus Dalbergia yield rosewoods; only about a dozen species do. The woods of some other {{species in the}} genus Dalbergia are notable - even famous - woods in their own right: <b>African</b> <b>blackwood,</b> cocobolo, kingwood, and tulipwood. The woods of some other species are usable for tool handles at best.|$|E
5000|$|Small {{growers in}} Naples, Florida have been {{successful}} in growing <b>African</b> <b>blackwood</b> there.

50|$|Boxwood was {{a common}} {{material}} for the manufacture of recorders in the eighteenth century, {{and a large number}} of mid- to high-end instruments made today are produced from one or other species of boxwood. Boxwood was once a popular wood for other woodwind instruments, and was among the traditional woods for Great Highland bagpipes before tastes turned to imported dense tropical woods such as cocuswood, ebony, and <b>African</b> <b>blackwood.</b>|$|E

50|$|Lignum vitae is {{hard and}} durable, {{and is also}} the densest wood traded (density: 1.23 g/cm3); it will easily sink in water. On the Janka Scale of Hardness, which {{measures}} hardness of woods, lignum vitae ranks highest of the trade woods, with a Janka hardness of 4500 lbf (compared with <b>African</b> <b>Blackwood</b> at 2940 lbf, Hickory at 1820 lbf, red oak at 1290 lbf, Yellow Pine at 690 lbf, and Balsa at 100 lbf).|$|E
5000|$|Besides {{its use in}} gun grips and knife handles, cocobolo {{is favored}} for fine inlay work for custom {{high-end}} cue sticks, police batons, pens, brush backs, and musical instruments, especially guitars, drums and basses. Some woodwind instruments, such as clarinets, oboes, and bagpipes, have been successfully made using cocobolo instead of the normal grenadilla (<b>African</b> <b>blackwood).</b> Further uses include veneers, bowls, jewelry boxes, pens, duck and goose calls, and other expensive specialty items.|$|E
5000|$|The dense, lustrous wood {{ranges from}} reddish to pure black. It is {{generally}} {{cut into small}} billets or logs with its sharply demarcated bright yellow white sapwood left on {{to assist in the}} slow drying so as to prevent cracks developing. Good quality [...] "A" [...] grade <b>African</b> <b>blackwood</b> commands high prices on the commercial timber market. The tonal qualities of <b>African</b> <b>blackwood</b> are particularly valued when used in woodwind instruments, principally clarinets, oboes, transverse flutes, piccolos, Highland pipes, and Northumbrian pipes. The timber is used mainly because of its machinability and dimensional stability. Deering Banjo Company uses blackwood ("grenadilla") to construct the tone ring in its John Hartford model banjo. Deering indicates that this reduces weight versus brass/bronze tone rings, and that the wood [...] "plays in" [...] (improves in tone) with use. Furniture makers {{from the time of the}} Egyptians have valued this timber. A story states that it has even been used as ballast in trading ships and that some enterprising Northumbrian pipe makers used old discarded blackwood ballast to great effect. The German knife companies Wüsthof and J. A. Henckels sell knives with blackwood handles due to the wood's moisture repellent qualities.|$|E
