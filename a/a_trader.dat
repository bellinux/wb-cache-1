5|$|Fakih's father {{helped him}} become <b>a</b> <b>trader,</b> {{although}} Fakih continued to study independently. When the modernist Islamic organisation Muhammadiyah opened a branch in Gresik in 1922, Fakih {{was one of}} the first to join. Extremely active in the group, he became the Gresik branch's leader within three years, and under his leadership the group was formally recognised by the central Muhammadiyah administration. Through his work with the Muhammadiyah in Gresik, Fakih became better known. He later transferred to the branch in Surabaya, a much larger city where, in 1929, he was chosen to sit on the city council. He also remained active in commerce, running a construction material trade and shipbuilding shop. During this period he served on the local chamber of commerce.|$|E
5|$|Grill {{established}} {{a small scale}} trade monopoly at Godegård in 1775. Before he became owner of the ironworks, the farmers around Godegård had refined the wrought iron from the factory into large quantities of nails using small trip hammers. The nails were sold in Askersund. As <b>a</b> <b>trader</b> Grill would not abide this. First he decreed that the farmers had to buy all their goods at the ironworks' general store. Second, he forbade the farmers and tenant farmers to sell nails to the merchants at Askersund, at that time a center for nail trade. In this way Grill assumed control over all nail trade himself.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} {{about the role of the}} {{endocrine}} system in financial risk taking. Here, we report the findings of a study in which we sampled, under real working conditions, endogenous steroids from a group of male traders in the City of London. We found that <b>a</b> <b>trader's</b> morning testosterone level predicts his day's profitability. We also found that <b>a</b> <b>trader's</b> cortisol rises with both the variance of his trading results and the volatility of the market. Our results suggest that higher testosterone may contribute to economic return, whereas cortisol is increased by risk. Our results point to a further possibility: testosterone and cortisol are known to have cognitive and behavioral effects, so if the acutely elevated steroids we observed were to persist or increase as volatility rises, they may shift risk preferences and even affect <b>a</b> <b>trader's</b> ability to engage in rational choice...|$|R

Historian Satz says this symbolized disagreement rather than acceptance of the terms of the treaty.

5|$|The Mission of the Guardian Angel {{was somewhere}} in the {{vicinity}} of Chicago from 1696 until it was abandoned in around 1700.

Much of the building is medieval; the font dates back to the 15th century; and there are plain hard wooden benches on the north side; on the south side are 19th century wooden box pews.

5|$|The first {{non-indigenous}} settler at Wolf Point {{may have}} been <b>a</b> <b>trader</b> named Guarie. Writing in 1880 Gurdon Hubbard, who first arrived in Chicago on October 1, 1818, stated {{that he had been}} told of Guarie by Antoine De Champs and Antoine Beson, who had been traversing the Chicago Portage annually since about 1778. Hubbard wrote that De Champs had shown him evidence of a trading house and the remains of a cornfield supposed to have belonged to Guarie. The cornfield was located on {{the west bank of the}} North Branch of the Chicago River, a short distance from the forks at what is now Fulton Street; early settlers named the North Branch of the Chicago River the Guarie River, or Gary's River.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lobengula {{moved to}} the north-east, now well out of the Company's reach for the {{foreseeable}} future. However, his sickness, {{which turned out to}} be smallpox, sharply intensified and eventually killed him on 22 or 23 January 1894. With the king dead, Mjaan, the most senior of the izinDuna, took command of the Matabele. Mjaan was an old man, and his only son had been killed in the war. He wished to make peace. In late February 1894, he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson, <b>a</b> <b>trader</b> known to them for many years, who offered the olive branch on behalf of the Company. The izinDuna unanimously accepted. They also told the trader what had happened to the Shangani Patrol, and led him to the battle site to survey it, as well as to examine and identify the largely skeletonised bodies of the soldiers, which still lay where they had fallen. Dawson was the first non-Matabele to learn of the last stand.|$|E
5|$|Purvis {{was born}} on July 4, 1857, into a family of Scottish descent. His parents were Robert Raaf Purvis and Annie Silburn Marshall. His {{paternal}} grandfather, William Purvis, who worked as <b>a</b> <b>trader</b> and ship captain, had settled in the Dutch East Indies in the 1810s {{while it was still}} part of the British Empire. The family lived in many places including Dutch East Indies, Brussels, and London. Educated at Cheltenham College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Edward William Purvis served as a sub-lieutenant of the 70th (Surrey) Regiment of Foot in Bengal, where he learned Hindi, and later as a sub-lieutenant for the 31st (Huntingdonshire) Regiment of Foot in Chatham, Kent. Around 1879 he resigned his British Army post and traveled to the Hawaiian Islands, where his father and older brother Robert William Theodore Purvis had already settled, having arrived on December13, 1877; his brother Theodore had started a sugar plantation business on the island of Kauai. A distant cousin of theirs was William Herbert Purvis, known for introducing macadamia nuts to Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|Tensions {{escalated}} between foreign traders on Samoa and {{the local}} populace, {{due in part to}} controls which Tilley had put in place to protect Samoan farmers from exploitation. Dr. David Starr Jordan, a prominent American biologist doing research in the territory, was so concerned by these tensions that he sent a letter to President Theodore Roosevelt asking that <b>a</b> <b>trader</b> not be made governor of the territory, if a civil administration were created. Shortly after, many traders and locals, including a Samoan tax collector, circulated a petition requesting a change in the way the copra crop was taxed and asking for the Navy to cease governing the territory. The petition was sent to members of Congress and the cause was picked up by California representative Julius Kahn and gathered significant press coverage. This movement eventually reached President Roosevelt; his decision was not to act on the petition.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} years that Alder lived with the Indians he was very ill, a {{condition}} Alder attributed to the Indians' diet. The {{other children in the}} village were friendly towards Alder, and worked together to teach him their language, customs, and traditions. In time, Alder fully adopted the Mingo way of life; he lived, hunted, and fought as an Indian. When he was old enough he was given an English musket, which he used to hunt mud turtles, wild turkeys, and raccoons. He was praised in the village for his hunting skills. He grew attached to his new life and when, in 1783, <b>a</b> <b>trader</b> from Kentucky offered to exchange him for a Shawnee prisoner, Alder refused. Alder was living in the Indian village of Mack-a-chack when it was destroyed by Benjamin Logan during his raid into Ohio Country in 1786, and he accompanied the Indians on raids into Kentucky to steal horses from white settlers.|$|E
5|$|The living {{conditions}} at the fort were poor. It was surrounded by marshes, with a poor road network, and the garrison had to survive on collected rainwater. <b>A</b> <b>trader</b> called a sutler built a house inside the southern entrance, growing vegetables within the south-west bastion and enjoying an effective monopoly on selling food to the soldiers. New barracks for the officers and enlisted men were rebuilt in 1772, but the officers often preferred to live across the river in the more urban setting of Gravesend, near the military headquarters there. A cricket match in 1776 between men from the Kentish and Essex sides of the Thames reportedly ended in bloodshed when guns were seized from the guardroom; newspapers recounted how an Essex man and a sergeant were shot dead, and a soldier was bayonetted, before both sides fled the scene. It is uncertain how accurate the newspaper account was, although the historians Andrew Saunders and Charles Kightly give it some credence.|$|E
