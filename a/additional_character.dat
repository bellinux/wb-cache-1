5|$|As {{the game}} is played, each PC changes over time and {{generally}} increases in capability. Characters gain (or sometimes lose) experience, skills and wealth, and may even alter their alignment or gain <b>additional</b> <b>character</b> classes. The key way characters progress is by earning experience points (XP), which happens when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task. Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a level, which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills. XP can be lost in some circumstances, such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy, or by use of certain magical powers that come with an XP cost.|$|E

25|$|Each week, NBC {{releases}} a Heroes webcomic. The comics give <b>additional</b> <b>character</b> background and plot information not {{shown in the}} television episodes. The graphic novels continued {{on a weekly basis}} during the show's 2007 summer hiatus. Wildstorm, a subsidiary of DC Comics, released them in published form on November 7, 2007. The first collected volume included novels 1–34, and featured two different covers by Alex Ross and Jim Lee as well as an introduction by Masi Oka and artwork by Tim Sale. The second volume included 35–80. It has an advertisement for a third volume, that would at least have 81–103, and more, and it was scheduled for fall 2009.

25|$|On June 17, 2010, I-play {{released}} a downloadable hidden object game based on 4:50 from Paddington (see the external links). Dialogue interspersed with the hidden object puzzles follows {{the plot of}} the original story. Items mentioned in the dialogue are among those hidden in each round. The player finds locations on the map by textual clues, which makes the map a hidden object scene, too. At three points during play the player is asked to hypothesize on the identity of the murderer, but as in the novel there is {{little in the way of}} relevant evidence. Unlike the games based on Evil Under the Sun, Murder on the Orient Express, and And Then There Were None, this does not include any actual detection and unlike the latter two does not add an <b>additional</b> <b>character</b> to represent the player. This is the 4th in a series of Oberon Games' hidden object games based on Agatha Christie's novels, the first three were based on Death on the Nile, Peril at End House, and Dead Man's Folly.|$|E

25|$|Gemini and Cheiron {{were the}} first {{characters}} to be created for the game. Gemini became the central heroine who would represent the Redneck stereotype, while the African American Cherion acted {{as a means for}} the story to tackle issues of discrimination in American culture. Each <b>additional</b> <b>character</b> was based around a particular theme; Rosarita was themed around Spaghetti Western culture, Subaru was a cold perfectionist similar to Sakura Wars 2 heroine Reni Milchstrasse, while Diana would be a handicapped character in a similar vein to Lobelia from Sakura Wars 3. Ratchet Altair, who had appeared in , was also included as a principle character and romance option. Rather than established protagonist Ichiro Ogami, the story focused on new protagonist Shinjiro. According to Hiroi, Shinjiro was the most difficult character to create, with the main aim being to differentiate his story from that of Ogami, with Shinjiro being made a more vulnerable character. The renewed cast played into the theme of a young country, whose actions would be performed in parallel to events in Japan. Fujishima was initially confused about the kings of characters Hiroi wanted, drawing multiple variations. Speaking about his design for Gemini, Fujishima described his design as having a samurai core within a stylized cowgirl.|$|E

500|$|A film {{loosely based}} on the novel was made in 1968, with a {{screenplay}} written by Roald Dahl and Ken Hughes. It was produced by Albert R. [...] "Cubby" [...] Broccoli, who had made five James Bond films previously. The film starred Dick Van Dyke as Caractacus Potts and Sally Ann Howes as Truly Scrumptious, an <b>additional</b> <b>character</b> who was not in Fleming's novel. Two actors from the Bond franchise were involved in the film: Desmond Llewelyn and Gert Fröbe, who played the parts of scrap-dealer Coggins and Baron Bomberst, respectively. A novelisation of the film was published by Pan Books in 1968, written by author John Burke.|$|E
500|$|While {{the core}} {{gameplay}} remains the same, multiple adjustments {{were made to}} existing systems. The HD version features four difficulty levels {{as opposed to the}} original's three, including an [...] "easy" [...] option. The original game's multiplayer elements were removed during optimization for consoles, and types of magic and accessories previously only available in multiplayer were incorporated into the single-player campaign. A feature unique to Type-0 HD is the support personnel (SP) system: when activated, AI-controlled support characters take the place of normal party members. SP points earned in battle can be used to purchase special items. <b>Additional</b> <b>character</b> costumes made included through the original's demos and downloadable content were included in Type-0 HD as unlockables, along with costumes unique to the HD version.|$|E

In the rear, a second, shorter tower contained the restaurant. The main buildings were built of structural clay tile with terra-cotta glazed brick. The two towers are clad in stucco with decorative green and gold glazed terra-cotta tiles and cast concrete stepped forms. Designed {{to attract the attention of}} the passing motorists, the towers also feature geometric detailing, curvilinear massing, and are outlined with neon lighting added <b>additional</b> <b>character</b> and uniqueness to the building's design.|$|E

500|$|Doomfist was a stray {{reference}} in Overwatchs original animated short whose obsessive popularity with fans led the development team {{to expand his}} lore with in-game references in the game's Numbani map. In the cinematic video used to announce the game in 2014, a boy is excited to see Doomfist's gauntlet on display behind glass at the Overwatch museum. Doomfist's gauntlet was a plot device, and the developers had not planned to create a character to wield it. Overwatch Creative Director Chris Metzen played with compound nouns to give the gauntlet a name reminiscent of a shotgun. The developers expanded the gauntlet into a Doomfist character in bits. In particular, they {{decided to use the}} gauntlet as the centerpiece for the game's Numbani environment, in which the gauntlet is encased in the map's objective, the payload, to be delivered to a Doomfist exhibit at a museum. By late 2015, the team decided Doomfist would be a generational hero, like that of superhero universes, were he to be a full-fledged playable character, the fourth <b>additional</b> <b>character</b> to be added to game, and 25th on the roster.|$|E
500|$|Bravely Default {{released}} on October 11, 2012. It {{was published by}} Square Enix. Along with the standard edition, Square Enix created a collector's edition for exclusive sale through their online store. The collector's edition featured an AR poster, a first print copy of the game's soundtrack, an art book, and a themed 3DS protective case. Downloadable content {{in the form of}} <b>additional</b> <b>character</b> costumes were made available both through promotional codes and post-release content. An updated edition of the game, titled Bravely Default: For the Sequel, was announced in August 2013 in Weekly Shōnen Jump for a release on December 5 that year. For the Sequel was stated to have over a hundred different improvements and adjustments: these included additional save slots, additional difficulty levels, auto saving options, the addition of new subevent scenes, new gameplay elements such as the [...] "Bravely Second" [...] ability, and subtitles in multiple languages. Many of these alterations were based on questionnaires sent out by the company after the original version's release. According to staff, For the Sequel was intended as a [...] "trial version" [...] for its sequel, already in development after the success of Bravely Default.|$|E
500|$|Upon Doomfist's {{official}} announcement, Kotaku {{reported the}} fan reaction as [...] "beyond excited". Fan anticipation {{for the character}} rivaled that for Sombra, a character released the previous year with a prolonged reveal period. Players had hoped {{for the release of}} Doomfist each time Blizzard had revealed an <b>additional</b> <b>character</b> for the game. Polygon wrote that Doomfist's announcement cinematic, drawn in an anime style, was the best in the series to date. Fans who had lobbied for Terry Crews to play Doomfist's voice were disappointed to discover his absence, but Sahr Ngaujah's performance was praised at the time of Doomfist's formal unveiling, and fans received the character positively anyway. Blizzard's choice of Ngaujah over the higher profile Crews also meant that the voice actor would be more available to reappear for additional recording and other game community events. Doomfist also fulfilled Overwatch sore lack of a supervillain, according to IGN, in a cast of other morally ambiguous but tragic and redeemable characters. The critic anticipated Doomfist as the start of Blizzard making Talon into a villainous organization à la Legion of Doom (Justice League) or Masters of Evil (Avengers).|$|E
