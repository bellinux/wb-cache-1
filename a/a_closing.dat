5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in four movements: a duet for soprano (S) and alto (A), a recitative for tenor (T), a chorus, and <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> chorale. He scored it for {{the three}} vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble. The duration is given as 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, four {{movements of}} alternating arias and recitatives, then the voices united in a duet and finally <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> chorale. He scored the intimate dialogue for soprano and bass soloist, a four-part choir {{only in the}} chorale, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboe (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo. The duration is given as 22 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>closed</b> {{immersion}} is finite and radicial (universally injective). In particular, <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> immersion {{is universally}} <b>closed.</b> <b>A</b> <b>closed</b> immersion is stable under base change and composition. The notion of <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> immersion is local {{in the sense}} that f is <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> immersion if and only if for some (equivalently every) open covering [...] the induced map [...] is <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> immersion.|$|R
50|$|The {{notion of}} closed {{manifold}} is unrelated {{with that of}} <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> set. <b>A</b> disk with its boundary is <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> subset of the plane, but not <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> manifold.|$|R

5|$|Bach {{structured}} {{the work}} in five movements, alternating arias and recitatives, and <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> chorale. The scoring requires only a small ensemble of a soprano soloist, three additional vocal parts for the chorale, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboe, strings and basso continuo. While the first aria is pensive and elegiac, the second aria is of dancing folk-like character.|$|E
5|$|The seven-movement cantata {{begins with}} a chorale fantasia and ends, after a {{sequence}} of alternating arias and recitatives, with <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> chorale as a four-part setting. Bach {{increased the number of}} accompanying instruments for the arias, from only continuo in the second movement, over two solo violins in the central movement of the cantata, to two oboes d'amore and strings in the sixth movement.|$|E
5|$|At {{the police}} station, Hank tells his rehearsed story to real FBI agents. As Sarah predicted, the agents {{do not believe}} that Hank, an {{upstanding}} member of the community, would be capable of such wrongdoing. Although he is ruled out as a suspect, Hank is told that the money was part of a ransom and that many of the bills' serial numbers were written down to track the cash. Hank realizes he cannot use the money without being caught; he goes home and burns it all. In <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> narration, Hank reflects on his losses; as he tries to move on with his life, the murderous events constantly haunt him.|$|E
40|$|We {{prove the}} {{existence}} of <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> regularization of the integration current associated to an effective analytic cycle, with a bounded negative part. By means of the King formula, we are reduced to regularize <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> differential form with L 1 loc coefficients, which by extension has a test value on any positive current with the same support as the cycle. As a consequence, the restriction of <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> positive current to <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> analytic submanifold is well defined as <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> positive current. Lastly, given <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> smooth differential (qʹ, qʹ) -form on <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> analytic submanifold, we prove {{the existence of}} <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> (qʹ, qʹ) -current having a restriction equal to that differential form.

5000|$|This often subsumes open (low) front vowels, {{because the}} tongue {{does not have}} as much {{flexibility}} in positioning as it does for the close (high) vowels; {{the difference between an}} open front vowel and an open back vowel is equal to the difference between <b>a</b> <b>close</b> front and <b>a</b> <b>close</b> central vowel, or <b>a</b> <b>close</b> central and <b>a</b> <b>close</b> back vowel.|$|R
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in five movements, {{an instrumental}} sinfonia, a recitative, a recitative with chorale, an aria and <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> chorale. He scored the work, like other cantatas written in Weimar, {{for a small}} ensemble of three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T), bass (B)), a four-part choir only in the chorales, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of four violas (Va), cello (Vc), bassoon (Fg) and basso continuo. The setting for four violas is unusual. In a similar orchestration, the Brandenburg Concerto No. 6 also omits violins.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata {{in seven}} movements, {{beginning with a}} chorale fantasia and ending in <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> chorale, as usually in his chorale cantatas, but with an unusual sequence of only one recitative and four arias, setting the poetic hymn stanzas. He scored it for three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T) and bass) (B), a four-part choir, and a Baroque chamber ensemble of corno da caccia (Co) to support the chorale tune in the outer movements, two flauti traversi (Ft), two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), two violas (Va) and basso continuo (Bc).|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements. In {{the typical}} format of Bach's chorale cantatas, {{the first and}} last movement on the first and stanza of the hymn are set for choir, as a chorale fantasia and <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> chorale. They frame alternating arias and recitatives with the librettist's text. Bach scored the work for three vocal soloists (alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble: trumpet (Tr), two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc). The duration of the piece has been stated as 22 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements. The {{first and}} last are set for choir as a chorale fantasia and <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> chorale. They frame alternating recitatives and arias with the text arranged by the librettist. Bach scored the work for three vocal soloists (alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble: four trombones (Tb), two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc). The duration of the piece has been stated as 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The cantata falls {{relatively}} {{early in}} Bach's chronology of cantata compositions. It was possibly composed for 24 February 1715, but more likely {{a year or}} even two earlier. Bach structured the work in five movements, a sinfonia, a recitative, a recitative with chorale, an aria and <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> chorale. He scored it for three vocal soloists, a four-partchoir only in the chorale, and an unusual Baroque instrumental ensemble of four violas, cello, bassoon and basso continuo. When he performed the work again as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, he added two recorders to double viola I and II an octave higher.|$|E
5|$|The {{essential}} elements of the coronation have remained largely unchanged for the past thousand years. The sovereign is first presented to, and acclaimed by, the people. He or she then swears an oath to uphold {{the law and the}} Church. Following that, the monarch is anointed with holy oil, invested with regalia, and crowned, before receiving the homage of his or her subjects. Wives of kings are then anointed and crowned as queen consort. The service ends with <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> procession, and since the 20th century it has been traditional for the royal family to appear later on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, before attending a banquet there.|$|E

Cameo {{appearances}} were made by model Jesus Luz and in an alternative video by her daughter Lourdes. At the 2010 Grammy Awards, the song received a nomination in the Best Dance Recording category. The song was used as <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> for The MDNA Tour in which Madonna energetically danced in a glittery outfit, {{and at one point}} {{put on a pair of}} headphones and pantomimed scratching records with colored cubes falling in the backdrop.|$|E
5|$|The villanelle is a nineteen-line poem {{made up of}} five {{triplets}} with <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> quatrain; {{the poem}} is characterized by having two refrains, initially used {{in the first and}} third lines of the first stanza, and then alternately used at the close of each subsequent stanza until the final quatrain, which is concluded by the two refrains. The remaining lines of the poem have an a-b alternating rhyme. The villanelle has been used regularly in the English language since the late 19th century by such poets as Dylan Thomas, W. H. Auden, and Elizabeth Bishop.|$|E
5|$|All {{the guests}} agree to stay — except Jean and Douglas. Due to their daughter's long-awaited success, {{they decide to}} return home but {{on the way to}} the airport, their taxi gets caught in a traffic jam. A {{rickshaw}} driver says that he can take only one of them. Jean sees it as a sign that it is time to split with Douglas; she bids him farewell and departs. He winds up at another hotel, discovering that it's nothing more than a brothel and drug den, and spends the rest of the night wandering the streets. He returns to the hotel just as Evelyn is leaving for work, and asks her out on a date. <b>A</b> <b>closing</b> montage with a voiceover shows Muriel checking in customers in an elegant renovated lobby, Madge dining with a handsome older Indian man, and Norman and Carol living happily together. Sonny and Sunaina are shown riding a motorbike and passing Douglas and Evelyn on another bike.|$|E

5|$|By 1852, {{the barge}} service to London only ran once a week, {{and it had}} ceased {{altogether}} three years later. Most vessels reaching Arundel were coasters rather than barges by 1886, and just 20 ships used the facilities that year. The Wey and Arun Canal closed in 1871. The proprietors of the upper river ceased to maintain the navigation from 1 January 1888, and the last barge passed through Hardham Tunnel on 29 January 1889. The river was abandoned as a navigation by a warrant issued {{as part of the}} Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1888. The River Lark in Suffolk was the only other river navigation abandoned at that time. The Board of Trade issued <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> order in 1896, and after that, there was no navigation authority responsible for the upper river. However, traffic did not cease entirely.|$|E
5|$|During this period, no golfer {{suffered}} from the pressure of competing at Augusta more than Greg Norman. In 1987, Norman lost a sudden-death playoff to Larry Mize when Mize holed out a remarkable 45-yard pitch shot to birdie the second playoff hole and win the Masters. In 1996, Norman tied the course record with an opening round 63, and had a six-stroke lead over Nick Faldo entering the final round. Norman shot a 78 while Faldo scored a 67 to win by five shots (for his third Masters championship). Norman also suffered in 1986 when after birdieing four straight holes, and needing only a par to tie Nicklaus for the lead and force a Monday playoff, he badly pushed his 4-iron approach on 18 and missed his par putt for <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> bogey.|$|E
5|$|Haydn's {{choice of}} D major for this quartet, {{with the second}} {{movement}} in D minor, optimises the use of open strings and allows for the work to be the loudest and most grandiose of the set. The first movement opens peculiarly: the first violin starts on an E, and proceeds to play a four-measure phrase that concludes with a D major chord. The use of <b>a</b> <b>closing</b> phrase to start the movement {{is the first of}} a number of unsettling incidents in the movement. The exposition withholds the expected cadence to the dominant almost until the exposition ends. And the movement itself has a tentative pianissimo ending that serves more as a link to the D-minor Adagio than a proper conclusion.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} known that any contact form is isotopic to a form that admits <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> Reeb orbit; for example, for any contact {{manifold}} there is a compatible open book decomposition, whose binding is <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> Reeb orbit. This {{is not enough to}} prove the Weinstein conjecture, though, because the Weinstein conjecture states that every contact form admits <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> Reeb orbit, while an open book determines <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> Reeb orbit for a form which is only isotopic to the given form.|$|R
