40|$|Joint leakage {{from low}} {{pressure}} natural gas distribution mains (typical value: 0. 25 ft[superscript 3] at 6 inwg gas pressure) is a persistent source of maintenance problems for utitlites. External encapsulation {{is the usual}} choice for repairing leaking joints. It is reliable and expensive, about $ 1000 per joint (80 % of which is for excavation and resurfacing). Consolidated Edison of New York is sponsoring a project to develop a cheap and reliable joint seal. No current sealing methods {{were found to be}} acceptable in Phase I. <b>Adhesion</b> <b>failures</b> between the seal and pipe were a major cause of seal failure. Preliminary Phase II research recommended the development of an internal mechanical seal. Such a seal would minimize excavation and eliminate <b>adhesion</b> <b>failures.</b> To complete Phase II, an internal mechanical seal was developed. The initial research indicated that cleaning of the pipe interior had to be minimized or eliminated. Testing demonstrated that a sealant, either asphalt or vulcanizing silicone, greatly enhanced the sealing of uncleaned pipes, while permitting low stress levels. This {{led to the development of}} a new internal mechanical seal concept for sealing uncleaned gas main joints. Joint tests of 2 injected silicone seal concepts were run. The Type 1 seal, which filled the joint recess, completely sealed an uncleaned pipe joint. The Type 2 seal, which spanned the joint recess with an elastomeric bridge, had a leak rate of 0. 000038 ft[superscript 3]/hr at 6 inwg gas pressure from an uncleaned joint. The leakage was caused by permiability of the silicone bridge. These flexible and compliant seals, clamped in place with retaining bands, provide mechanical support for the sealant throughout the seal life, and thus do not rely on adhesion...|$|R
50|$|To {{increase}} {{the life of}} carbide tools, they are sometimes coated. Four such coatings are TiN (titanium nitride), TiC (titanium carbide), Ti(C)N (titanium carbide-nitride), and TiAlN (titanium aluminum nitride). (Newer coatings, known as DLC (Diamond-like carbon) are beginning to surface, enabling the cutting power of diamond without the unwanted chemical reaction between real diamond and iron.) Most coatings generally increase a tool's hardness and/or lubricity. A coating allows {{the cutting edge of}} a tool to cleanly pass through the material without having the material gall (stick) to it. The coating also helps to decrease the temperature associated with the cutting process and {{increase the}} life of the tool. The coating is usually deposited via thermal CVD and, for certain applications, with the mechanical PVD method. However, if the deposition is performed at too high temperature, an eta phase of a Co6W6C tertiary carbide forms at the interface between the carbide and the cobalt phase, which may lead to <b>adhesion</b> <b>failure</b> of the coating.|$|E
50|$|Assuming {{the proper}} EN {{formulation}} is selected {{to deliver the}} desired stress level, a reduction in compressive stress or even a shift to tensile is possible under certain conditions and must be avoided. Operating an EN bath outside of its recommend guidelines will impact stress. As a plater desires to push a process to plate faster, raising the pH is often the first button to push. When the pH is increased the deposit phosphorus drops, compressive stress is reduced and {{this can lead to}} negative results. Platers are commonly surprised to find a process that was plating with no stress cracks or <b>adhesion</b> <b>failure</b> the day before is now producing failures. A simple view of the record books or quick analysis reveals the culprit. An even more common contributor to an increase in an EN deposits tensile nature is bath age. It has been well documented that an EN process designed to produce a compressive deposit will stop doing so after a certain bath age (roughly 5 metal turnovers). It is at this point where the presence of reaction by products, sodium orthophosphate, begins to contribute to tensile stress. One can continue to plate in this bath but must be fully aware that stress will increase and could lead to adhesion and/or cracking failures. This is most evident, again, with thicker films. Figure 13 represents this phenomenon. There are certain additives that, when used carefully, can reduce the tensile stress even as the EN bath ages.The photos in figure 14 are of two identical parts, each plated in the same bath but at different bath ages. The part on the right was plated in a relatively new bath whereas {{the one on the left}} was plated in a bath nearly 10 metal turnovers old. You’ll note the clear evidence of flaking and separation due to the high tensile stress.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to develop a}} solid {{knowledge}} on formulation effects controlling offset ink-paper coating adhesion and to identify key factors of the coating and printing process affecting it. Focus lay on comprehending the impact of pigment dispersant on ink-paper coating adhesion and ultimately on the print quality of offset prints. The work covers laboratory studies, a pilot coating trial designed to produce coated material with a span in surface chemistry and structure, and an industrial offset printing trial. The lab scale studies quantified ink-paper coating <b>adhesion</b> <b>failure</b> during ink setting with a developed laboratory procedure based on the Ink-Surface Interaction Tester (ISIT) and image analysis. Additional polyacrylate dispersant resulted in slower ink setting and reduced ink-paper coating adhesion, with a dependence on its state of salt neutralisation and cation exchange, mainly in the presence of moisture/liquid water. The industrial printing trial on pilot coated papers was designed to study how these laboratory findings affected full scale offset print quality. These trials confirmed the dispersant-sensitive effect on ink-paper coating adhesion, especially at high water feeds. Evaluation of prints from the printing trial resulted in two fundamentally different types of ink <b>adhesion</b> <b>failure</b> being identified. The first type being traditional ink refusal, and the second type being a novel mechanism referred to as ink-lift-off <b>adhesion</b> <b>failure.</b> Ink-lift-off <b>adhesion</b> <b>failure</b> occurs when ink is initially deposited on the paper but then lifted off in a subsequent print unit. In this work, ink <b>adhesion</b> <b>failure</b> by this ink-lift-off mechanism was observed to occur more often than failure due to ink refusal. Print quality evaluation of the industrial prints suggested that water induced mottle was caused by a combination of ink-surface <b>adhesion</b> <b>failure,</b> creating white spots on the print, together with variation in ink layer thickness due to emulsified ink.

Second, the monetite crystals were converted to apatite by hydrolysis in NaOH solution. Composition and morphology of the initial and final coatings were identified using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The final coating was porous and the apatite crystals were agglomerated and followed the outline of the large monetite crystals. The average tensile bond of the coating was 5. 2 MPa and cohesion failures were observed more frequently than <b>adhesion</b> <b>failures.</b> The coating <b>adhesion</b> measured using scratch test was 13. 1 N.

40|$|In {{order to}} choose the best working fabric for screen {{printing}} in a school graphic arts laboratory, a representative group of eight polyester fabric samples were tested. The fabrics covered a range of mesh counts from coarse to medium and included fabrics of both multifilament and mono filament types for each mesh count. Both types were of medium grade or quality, 2 ̆ 2 XX 2 ̆ 2 for the multifilament and 2 ̆ 2 T 2 ̆ 2 for the monofilament. A specially designed resolution test object was printed by college level students in an introductory graphic arts class using indirect stencils with the sample fabrics. The stencil and five of the fifty copies from each student were inspected to obtain stencil edge definition and print resolution data. The subjects also completed a report sheet {{to provide information about}} stencil leakage, plugging problems in the mesh and stencil <b>adhesion</b> <b>failures.</b> Resolution and edge definition data were each subjected to a two factor analysis of variance, the two factors being fabric type and mesh count. Information from the student reports was tallied and plotted in histogram form for comparison of the incidence of printing problems. Results of the experiment showed a high degree of interaction between fabric type and mesh count, making it hard to generalize about effects of the two factors for finest resolution obtainable. Each combination of mesh count and fabric type had to then be compared to see exactly which samples would give specific results. Two fabric samples, 200 mesh and 25 XX, gave finest resolution and two others, 135 mesh and 10 XX, gave the lowest resolution. No effect was evident for edge definition. Student reports pointed out that the multifilament fabric was less prone to stencil <b>adhesion</b> <b>failures</b> and leakage problems. A great deal of variation due to individual student differences was also found, and because of such wide dispersion, many of the fabrics produced results which were not found to be different, even though some of the meshes were on opposite ends of the range of samples. Another effect of the variation was the occurrence of trends which in a normal screen printing plant would not be expected to happen. Because of this, conclusions could only pertain to a school laboratory environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{deposition}} of interference coatings with optical functions (e. g., anti-reflective coatings, beam splitters and filters) on plastic substrates is becoming ever more important. A well-known deposition method for such coatings on polymers is plasma ion-assisted vacuum evaporation (plasma ion-assisted deposition or plasma IAD). However, the industrial production of well-adhering dielectric coatings on unlacquered polymer surfaces {{has not yet}} been developed to a satisfactory level.

Owing to the characteristics of cathodic are evaporation (CAE), the film structure and composition of (Ti,Al) N can be tailored by controlling the substrate bias voltage. Percentages of aluminum decreased as the substrate bias voltage increased. A graded (Ti,AI) N coating was configured by progressively decreasing the bias voltage from - 300 V to - 150 V. (Ti,Al) N-coated M 2 steel and WC/Co substrates were compared. An improvement in microhardness and film adhesion, especially when deposited on WC/Co substrates, was observed. The (Ti,AI) N-coated cermet tools demonstrated significantly enhanced wear life. Unexpected <b>adhesion</b> <b>failures,</b> however, were observed if (Ti,Al) N was coated upon M 2 steels.

Several systems are discussed, including Cu, Al, AlN/XC 70 steel; Cu, Au/Al 2 O 3; and Cu/Ni. Furthermore, the following effects of deposition conditions on adhesion are also discussed: the effect of heating the sample during or after deposition; the effect of applying a bias voltage on the substrate during deposition; the effect of ion bombardment etching of the substrate surface; the effect of ageing treatment after deposition; the effect of chemical etching treatment before deposition. The scratch track was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and some energy-dispersive X-ray spectra were recorded to reveal whether the coating was completely removed from its substrate or not. The <b>adhesion</b> <b>failure</b> probability was estimated for each load (Q) by optically inspecting the channels. A correlation between the thermal contact resistance and the adhesion, as determined by the scratch test, is found.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{application}} of surface acoustic waves for Youngs modulus measurement and non-destructive characterisation of thermally sprayed coatings is presented. This method {{can be used for}} fast and direct determination of the Youngs modulus of nearly any coating. The Youngs moduli obtained using the two different methods of laser acoustics and depth-sensing indentation were in good agreement for hardmetal coatings, but not for oxide coatings due to the existence of cracks. Because the laser acoustic method takes coating defects into consideration and analyses a much higher material volume it is assumed to produce more realistic results than those obtained with depth-sensing indentation. Laser acoustic measurements were conducted with the LAwave laboratory device and a portable handheld device. The advantages of the handset are the suitability to larger pieces (e. g. rolls) and the lower investment costs. Comparative measurements confirmed the applicability of both devices. The pore morphology (cracks) but also their orientation were observed to have a greater influence than the pore volume on the Youngs modulus of the coating. Therefore, this method is not directly equivalent to porosity measurement, e. g. using image analysis.

The bulk {{properties of the coating}} materials and the substrate such as thermal coefficient of expansion, Young’s Modulus, Poisson’s Ratio, etc., are basic parameters to be considered.

These properties depend at least upon process temperature, deposition rate, and plasma assist parameters. These plasma parameters include ion species, ion voltage, and ion to atom arrival rate. The resulting film structure includes porosity, crystal form, density, non-uniformity, and possible surface and chemical interactions. The design of an optical thin film coating is mostly the refinement of the thicknesses of the layers to produce the desired reflection versus wavelength. It has been found that considerable variation in layer thicknesses can still achieve the desired spectral result. A major factor in the stress contribution of each individual layer is its thickness. Thin film design software can balance both the optical performance and the residual stress in the overall coating on the specific substrate with specific deposition processes, but it is first necessary to characterize the properties of the materials produced by those processes...|$|R

30|$|Laparoscopic microsurgical {{salpingotomy}} for undisturbed tubal {{ectopic pregnancy}} is a universally accepted line of treatment. Since first described in 1977 [12], laparoscopic surgery {{is considered to}} be the cornerstone of treatment in the majority of tubal pregnancy in hemodynamically stable patients desiring further fertility. Unfortunately, it may be impossible to use laparoscopy in many centers, due to the bad general condition of the patient or the unavailability of a competent laparoscopy setup or a well-trained surgeon. Whether to carry out salpingectomy or try to preserve the fallopian tube whenever possible is controversial. The proposed advantages of preserving the tube are to increase the chances of subsequent pregnancy by leaving a healthy tube and to improve the psychic state of the patient postoperatively. On the other hand, salpingectomy will definitely decrease the chance of ectopic pregnancy at this side and will minimize the risk of postoperative oozing from the site of the gestational sac and, hence, postoperative <b>adhesions.</b> <b>Failure</b> of complete trophoblast evacuation or recognition of underlying tubal disease and the possibility of trophoblast seeding in the peritoneal cavity are real risks of conservative management [13]. In this study, we conceived the concept of conservative management whenever possible, since the patients in developing countries have access to limited resources, which hinder assisted reproductive techniques that are not covered by the health care system. Our results significantly supported this concept, where pregnancy was achieved in 40 out of 56 cases (71.4 %) and 15 out of 47 cases (32 %) following salpingotomy and salpingectomy, respectively.

Finally, intra-laminar failure of the composite also indicates good <b>adhesion,</b> since the <b>failure</b> is cohesive within the composite adherend and not at the interface. Furthermore, this type of failure also indicates that the intra-laminar strength of the composite adherend {{is lower than the}} debonding strength of the adhesive. The downside of obtaining ILFC is that it deviates the results from characterizing the adhesive to the composites. The % of failure mode was based on an area estimation of each failure mode by visual observation of the specimens’ fracture surface after testing. The % of failure mode are therefore rough estimations with an error of ± 10 %. The visual features typical of each failure mode were further confirmed in selected fracture surfaces using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).|$|R
40|$|Transdermal drug {{delivery}} system (TDDS), also known as “patches”, are the dosage forms designed to deliver a therapeutically effective amount of drug across a patient’s skin. The adhesive of the transdermal {{drug delivery}} system is very crucial to the safety, efficacy {{and quality of the}} product. Recently, it has been recognized that the skin can also serve as the port of administration for systemically active drugs. The drugs applied topically are first absorbed into the blood stream and then are transported to the target tissues. Now, it is becoming evident that the benefits of intra venous infusion can be closely duplicated by using skin as the port of drug administration to provide continuous transdermal drug infusion into the systemic circulation. One of the objectives of TDDS is the maintenance of blood concentration of drug at therapeutic level by means of controlled permeation throughout the skin during {{a long period of time}} and using only one administration. The drug input can be terminated at any point of time by just removing the patch. Rate of drug release from the TDDS is normally much greater than the amount that the skin can possibly absorb. Hence, even if there is a variation in skin permeability, a constant rate of drug input into the circulation is achieved. This article provides an overview of type of transdermal systems, role of <b>adhesion,</b> possible <b>adhesion</b> <b>failures</b> and the measurement of adhesion. In vitro techniques like peel adhesion, tack and shear strength are discussed. Adhesion needs to be a critical parameter for designing a transdermal {{drug delivery system}} in order to provide good quality and efficacy to the patient. This review also covers a brief outline of various components of a patch, their advantages, when the patch should be used and when their use should be avoided...|$|R
