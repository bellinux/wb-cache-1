50|$|Control of the <b>American</b> <b>Dagger</b> <b>Nematode</b> {{presents}} {{problems because}} X. americanum {{is hard to}} completely remove. Nematicides generally remove up to 95% of the nematodes in soil, however the 5% that remain can reproduce asexually and the viruses that they carry can still infect the roots of young plants. Therefore, to eliminate the nematodes, nematicides should be used along with having a bare soil field {{for at least a}} 2-year period. This ensures that the X. americanum has no food source. At the end of this 2-year period the nematodes should be eradicated.|$|E

50|$|X. americanum is a plant {{parasite}} that lives {{entirely in the}} soil and is attracted to young, growing roots due to source-sink dynamics. These nematodes are migratory ectoparasites {{and all of the}} life stages of the <b>American</b> <b>Dagger</b> <b>Nematode</b> feed at the root tips of plants. Since it is a migratory ectoparasite, they remain outside the root or other feeding areas and feed on epidermal cells or on cells deeper in the root.

Other nematodes include Aphelenchoides subtenuis, which penetrates the roots causing basal plate disease and Pratylenchus penetrans (lesion nematode) the main cause of root rot in narcissi. Other nematodes such as the longodorids (Longidorus spp. or needle nematodes and Xiphinema spp. or <b>dagger</b> <b>nematodes)</b> and the stubby-root nematodes or trichodorids (Paratrichodorus spp. and Trichodorus spp.) can also act as vectors of virus diseases, such as TBRV and TomRSV, in addition to causing stunting of the roots.|$|R

Major species include X.americanum, X.diversicaudatum, X.index, X.italiae and X.pachtaicum. They can be easily recognized by their long bodies and stylets which are long enough to reach the vascular tissue of plants. Different members of the genus have been shown to induce moderate to large amounts of root damage through root penetration, which in some species results in the formation of galls. They are of agricultural concern because they are vectors of nepoviruses, transferring them during feeding.

It is spread by contaminated seed and the grafting of infected rootstocks. In an early experiment, it was shown that California <b>dagger</b> <b>nematodes</b> inoculated with GFLV were still infective after eight months. It is speculated that the two pathogens evolved together, since {{there is evidence that}} the presence of GFLV gives a survival advantage to X. index and not other species of nematodes.

40|$|<b>Dagger</b> and needle <b>nematodes</b> are {{considered}} globally {{one of the}} 10 most economically important nematode groups. They interact with the p lants by direct damage in feeding process from them or in plant virus transmission. The accurate a nd timely identification of <b>dagger</b> and needle <b>nematodes</b> infecting vineyards {{is a prerequisite for}} designing effective management strategies. This is particularly relevant in grapevine fields because o f the diversity of these nematodes and the need for distinction between virus vector and non-virus vect or nematodes. This present study establishes the biodiversity of longidorids found in grapevines at southern Spain, as well as their integrative diagno sis and molecular phylogenetic relationships, using mor phometrical analysis and molecular markers including D 2 -D 3 expansion regions of 28 S rRNA, 18 S rRNA and ITS 1 -rRNA. Xiphinema pachtaicum and X. index were the most frequently <b>dagger</b> <b>nematodes</b> found (9 0. 8 and 30. 3 % frequency of infestation, respectively), but other dagger specie s included X. adenohystherum, X. hispidum, X. italiae, X. lupini, X. nuragicum, X. rivesi, and X. turcicum (1. 3 %, 7. 9 %, 13. 2 %, 3. 9 %, 1. 3 %, 2. 6 %, and 1. 3 % frequency of infestation, respectively). N eedle nematodes were less abundant and diverse including only Longidorus alvegus and L. magnus (2. 6 % and 11. 8 % frequency of infestation, respectively). The species identification based on sequencing of rRNA regions and BLAST analysis was congruent with species identification based on morphometrical studies. D 2 -D 3 expansion segments of 28 S rDNA and ITS 1 were most useful for <b>dagger</b> and needle <b>nematode</b> species identification since they showed more variability t han partial 18 S rDNA. Results also showed a high level of nematode endemism (such as X. adenohystherum, X. hispidum, X. nuragicum, X. lupini and L. alvegus) and their phylogenetic grouping suggest a common origin for several of the longidorid species found and the Iberian Peninsula as their po tential centre of origin. Phylogeny showed two major clades well defined and supported including Longidorus and Xiphinema species. However, the grouping of Longidorus and Paralongidorus species with the rest of species is well supported. Nevertheless, tree topology analysis by Shimodaira- Hasegawa test of D 2 -D 3 and partial 18 S of our broad sequences did not refute the monophyly of the genus Xiphinema, but the genus Paralongidorus was not accepted as a valid.

40|$|The ectoparasitic <b>dagger</b> <b>nematode</b> (Xiphinema index), vector of Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV), provokes gall {{formation}} {{and can cause}} severe damage to the root system of grapevines. Mycorrhiza formation by Glomus (syn.

Suppressive effects increased with time and were greater when the nematode was post-inoculated rather than co-inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus. Using a split-root system, decreased X. index development was shown in mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal parts of mycorrhizal root systems, indicating that both local and systemic induced bioprotection mechanisms were active against the ectoparasitic nematode. Expression analyses of ESTs (expressed sequence tags) generated in an SSH (subtractive suppressive hybridization) library, representing plant genes up-regulated during mycorrhiza-induced control of X. index, and of described grapevine defence genes showed activation of chitinase 1 b, pathogenesis-related 10, glutathione S-transferase, stilbene synthase 1, 5 -enolpyruvyl shikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase, and a heat shock proein 70 -interacting protein {{in association with the}} observed local and/or systemic induced bioprotection against the nematode. Overall, the data suggest priming of grapevine defence responses by the AM fungus and transmission of a plant-mediated signal to non-mycorrhizal tissues. Grapevine gene responses during AM-induced local and systemic bioprotection against X. index point to biological processes that are related either to direct effects on the nematode or to protection against nematode-imposed stress to maintain root tissue integrity...|$|R

Such a variation may be influenced by relevant biotic and abiotic factors. For example, in New Brunswick, Canada, 500 lesion nematodes per kilogram of dry soil are considered a level where pre-plant treatment to control the nematodes would be beneficial (Anonymous 2018 c). Whereas, the treatment levels there for pin (Paratylenchus projectus), root knot, and needle (Longidorus spp.) nematodes per kilogram of dry soil are 5000, 500, and 200 respectively. Yet, treatment for needle nematodes is usually only considered when they are found in combination with <b>dagger</b> <b>nematodes</b> (Xiphinema spp.) in the same field. Spiral (Helicotylenchus spp.), stunt (Tylenchorynchus spp.), and ring (Criconemoides spp.) nematodes are frequently found in samples from strawberry plantations. However, like Egypt, their exact impact on yield, if any, is not recorded. Moreover, damage threshold level for species of root-knot, sting (Belonolaimus), lesion, and sheath (Hemicycliophora) nematodes associated with strawberry plants is given by nematode extension service, University of Florida, USA. Minimum numbers of these nematode genera per 100 [*]cm 3 of soil at which the crop is at risk of nematode damage are 1, 1, 80, and 80, respectively (Abd-Elgawad and Askary 2015). Such pre-plant thresholds may not be useful on established strawberry. Action thresholds necessitate RKN control if it is detected from strawberry-planted soil in Egypt too.

A number of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) were discovered but this method is inaccurate and the genetic architecture of the studied population was better captured by the BLasso method of genomic selection, which allowed for efficient inference about the genetic contribution of the various marker loci.

[...] The nematode itself inflicts direct damage to plants roots as it penetrates at its preferred feeding site just behind the root tip. [...] Its long stylet enables it to reach into the vascular system of the plant causing local necrosis and hypertrophy. [...] This feeding action prompts the formation of galls on lateral roots, in turn leading to a stunted root system. [...] Above ground symptoms may not always be present in low-level infections but could include: reduced vigor, and chlorosis of leaves. [...] It is often not just the presence of nematodes that is a concern but it is their ability to serve as a virus vector, in this case for the arabis mosaic virus. The odontophore and esophagus are lined with cuticle, which has been shown to retain virus particles as a monolayer. These particles can then be shed with the cuticular lining as the nematode progresses through its normal life cycle.

A previous study found that resistance to X. index derived from Vitis arizonica was largely controlled by a major quantitative trait locus, XiR 1 (X. index Resistance 1), located on chromosome 19. The study presented here develops high-resolution genetic and physical maps {{in an effort to}} identify the XiR 1 gene(s). The mapping was carried out with 1, 375 genotypes in three populations derived from D 8909 - 15, a resistant selection from a cross of V. rupestris A. de Serres (susceptible)  × V. arizonica b 42 - 26 (resistant). Resistance to X. index was evaluated on 99 informative recombinants that were identified by screening the three populations with two markers flanking the XiR 1 locus. The high-resolution genetic map of XiR 1 was primarily constructed with seven DNA markers developed in this study. Physical mapping of XiR 1 was accomplished by screening three bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries constructed from D 8909 - 15, V. vinifera Cabernet Sauvignon and V. arizonica b 42 - 26.

We report the first genome of an intracellular Verrucomicrobium and the first exclusively intracellular non-Wolbachia nematode symbiont. Results revealed that Xiphinematobacter had a small 0. 916 -Mb genome with only 817 predicted proteins, resembling genomes of other mutualist endosymbionts. Compared with free-living relatives, conserved proteins were shorter on average, and there was large-scale loss of regulatory pathways. Despite massive gene loss, more genes were retained for biosynthesis of amino acids predicted to be essential to the host. Gene ontology enrichment tests showed enrichment for biosynthesis of arginine, histidine, and aromatic amino acids, as well as thiamine and coenzyme A, diverging from the profiles of relatives Akkermansia muciniphilia (in the human colon), Methylacidiphilum infernorum, and the mutualist Wolbachia from filarial nematodes. Together, these features and the location in the gut suggest that Xiphinematobacter functions as a nutritional mutualist, supplementing essential nutrients that are depleted in the nematode diet. This pattern points to evolutionary convergence with endosymbionts found in sap-feeding insects...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} three {{cropping}} histories (sugarcane, maize and soybean) and two tillage practices (conventional tillage and direct drill) on plant-parasitic and free-living nematodes {{in the following}} sugarcane crop was examined in a field trial at Bundaberg. Soybean reduced populations of lesion nematode (Pratylenchus zeae) and root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne javanica) in comparison to previous crops of sugarcane or maize but increased populations of spiral nematode (Helicotylenchus dihystera) and maintained populations of <b>dagger</b> <b>nematode</b> (Xiphinema elongatum). However the effect of soybean on P zeae and M. javanica was no longer apparent 15 weeks after planting sugarcane, while later in the season, populations of these nematodes following soybean were as high as or higher than maize or sugarcane. Populations of P zeae were initially reduced by cultivation but due to strong resurgence tended to be higher in conventionally tilled than direct drill plots {{at the end of}} the plant crop. Even greater tillage effects were observed with M. javanica and X. elongatum, as nematode populations were significantly higher in conventionally tilled than direct drill plots late in the season. Populations of free-living nematodes in the upper 10 cm of soil were initially highest following soybean, but after 15, 35 and 59 weeks were lower than after sugarcane and contained fewer omnivorous and predatory nematodes. Conventional tillage increased populations of free-living nematodes in soil in comparison to direct drill and was also detrimental to omnivorous and predatory nematodes. These results suggest that crop rotation and tillage not only affect plant-parasitic nematodes directly, but also have indirect effects by impacting on natural enemies that regulate nematode populations. More than 2 million nematodes/m(2) were often present in crop residues on the surface of direct drill plots. Bacterial-feeding nematodes were predominant in residues early in the decomposition process but fungal-feeding nematodes predominated after 15 weeks. This indicates that fungi become an increasingly important component of the detritus food web as decomposition proceeds, and that that the rate of nutrient cycling decreases with time. Correlations between total numbers of free-living nematodes and mineral N concentrations in crop residues and surface soil suggested that the free-living nematode community may provide an indication of the rate of mineralisation of N from organic matter...|$|R
