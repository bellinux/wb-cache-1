5|$|Because of the tour's cancellation, various {{media outlets}} {{circulated}} speculation that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned her {{plans for a}} tour as a result. Many reports were made claiming that Carey had been visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles.

For that reason, she cancelled the tour, and lost the child only two months later. Carey later opted to record a new album, that would be released {{during the summer of}} 2009.

5|$|Tameka Williams {{qualified}} {{to run in}} the 100 meter and 200 meter sprints.
