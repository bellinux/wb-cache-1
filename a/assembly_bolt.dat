40|$|Thermal cook-off {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} using LX- 04 explosive (85 % HMX and 15 % Viton by weight) with different levels of confinement to characterize the effect of confinement on the reaction violence. These experiments involved heating a porous LX- 04 sample in a stainless steel container with varying container end plate thickness and <b>assembly</b> <b>bolt</b> diameter to control overall confinement. As expected, detonation did not occur and reducing the overall confinement lowered the reaction violence. This is consistent with modeling results that predict that a lower confinement will act to lower the cook-off pressure and thus the overall burn rate which lowers the overall violence. These results suggest that controlling the overall system confinement can modify the relative safety in a given scenario...|$|E
40|$|Durability {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} remaining issues impeding successful commercialization of broad PEM fuel cell transportation energy applications. Automotive fuel cells are likely to operate with neat hydrogen under load-following or load-levelled modes and be expected to withstand variations in environmental conditions, particularly in the context of temperature and atmospheric composition. In addition, they are also required to survive over the course of their expected operational lifetimes i. e., around 5, 500 hrs, while undergoing as many as 30, 000 startup/shutdown cycles. The damage mechanisms in a PEM fuel cell are accelerated by mechanical stresses arising during fuel cell <b>assembly</b> (<b>bolt</b> assembling), and the stresses arise during fuel cell running, because it consists of the materials with different thermal expansion and swelling coefficients. Therefore, in order to acquire a complete understanding of the damage mechanisms in the membrane, mechanical response under steady-state hygro-thermal stresses should be studied under real cell operating conditions and in real cell geometry (three-dimensional). In this work, full three-dimensional, non-isothermal computational fluid dynamics model of a PEM fuel cell has been developed to simulate the stresses inside the PEM fuel cell, which are occurring during fuel cell <b>assembly</b> (<b>bolt</b> assembling), and the stresses arise during fuel cell running due to the changes of temperature and relative humidity. A unique feature of the present model is to incorporate the effect of hygro and thermal stresses into actual three-dimensional fuel cell model. In addition, the temperature and humidity dependent material properties are utilize in the simulation for the membrane. The model is shown to be able to understand the many interacting, complex electrochemical, transport phenomena, and stresses distribution that have limited experimental data. This model is used to study and analyse the effect of operating parameters on the mechanical behaviour of PEM.

A three cylinder, two stroke Detroit 3 - 53 engine was heavily instrumented for time resolved measurements. In particular, a 3, 600 count per revolution optical encoder was used along with accelerometers mounted on various engine structures, in-cylinder pressure measurements {{and a variety of}} steady state sensors, such as exhaust temperatures. A large number of baseline data were taken to establish the statistical characteristics on the signals from the engine. These runs were followed by a series of experiments where the cylinder head <b>assembly</b> <b>bolt</b> torque were varied parametrically.

Connection design uses the temperature-dependent bolt strength-reduction factors prescribed in Eurocode 3, despite the existence of two distinct failure modes under tension; necking of the bolt shank, and thread-stripping. While literature exists to predict failure modes at ambient temperature, there is no method for failure mode prediction for elevated temperatures where ductility is critical to avoid collapse. Galvanised M 20 structural <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> and <b>bolt</b> material from a single batch have been tested under tension at a range of temperatures and strain-rates typical of those experienced in fire. Turned-down bolt test data produced stress-strain curves characteristic of different microstructures at ambient temperature, despite a tempered-martensitic microstructure being specified in the standards. The failure modes of <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> {{were found to be}} dependent on the as-received microstructure at ambient temperature.

50|$|The roller-locked <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly</b> {{consists}} of a bolt head, two rollers, a striker sleeve, bolt body, and a large return spring, {{which is responsible for}} pushing the <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly</b> into battery (the locked position) and returning it there when it is unlocked and pushed backwards by the recoil of firing or by the charging handle. As the striker sleeve is movable back and forth within the <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly,</b> the return spring is also responsible for pushing the striker sleeve forward during locking (described below). The <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly</b> locks with the barrel's breech (the end the cartridge is loaded into) via a prong type barrel extension behind the breech. As it is recoil-operated and fired from an open bolt, the weapon must be manually charged with the side-mounted charging handle.|$|R

The model is shown {{to be able to}} understand the many interacting, complex electrochemical, transport phenomena, and stresses distribution that have limited experimental data. The results show that the non-uniform distribution of stresses, caused by the temperature gradient in the cell, induces localized bending stresses, which can contribute to delaminating between the membrane and the gas diffusion layers. These results may explain the occurrence of cracks and pinholes in the membrane during regular cell operation. This model is used to study the effect of operating, design, and material parameters on fuel cell hygro-thermal stresses in polymer membrane, catalyst layers, and gas diffusion layers. Detailed analyses of the fuel cell durability under various operating conditions have been conducted and examined. The analysis helped identifying critical parameters and shed insight into the physical mechanisms leading to a fuel cell durability under various operating conditions. Optimization study of a PEM fuel cell durability has been performed. To achieve long cell life, the results show that the cell must be operate at lower cell operating temperature, higher cell operating pressure, higher stoichiometric flow ratio, and must have higher GDL porosity, higher GDL thermal conductivity, higher membrane thermal conductivity, narrower gases channels, thicker gas diffusion layers, and thinner membrane.

50|$|The primary {{problems}} of the traditional Direct Gas Impingement system was its extreme heat as well as carbon deposits in the <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly</b> and <b>bolt</b> carrier group. The problems occur during the firing of a round, as in order to recycle the weapon’s mechanisms, necessary force through high-pressured hot gases from the barrel’s gas port are rammed back through a gas tube to the <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly</b> and <b>bolt</b> carrier group. As a result, wear and tear after a few thousand rounds become evident. Another problem was that of excessive recoil and muzzle rise, due mainly to the conventional high-powered rifle’s high operating cyclic rate of fire (approximately 850-950 rounds per minute) and to the design itself whereby the hot compressed gases are rammed back into the bolt contributing to the recoil and muzzle rise. This results to cycling and reliability problems and firing accuracy issues. Simply put, due to its higher rate of fire and overall design, the rifle has a high tendency to jam and the soldier will have trouble controlling his aim when the rifle is fired in bursts or full automatic due to too much recoil and muzzle rise and flip to the “1 or 2 o’clock” position.|$|R

40|$|In {{structural}} fire engineering, {{the importance of}} <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> is often overlooked. Connection design uses the temperature-dependent bolt strength-reduction factors prescribed in Eurocode 3, despite the existence of two distinct failure modes under tension; bolt breakage, and thread-stripping. This thesis investigates the factors which influence failure modes at ambient and elevated temperatures {{and a range of}} strain-rates through microstructural characterisation, tensile testing and finite element modelling. Microstructural characterisation carried out on M 20 galvanised <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> consisting of Grade 8. 8 bolts and Property Class 10 nuts from a range of manufacturers has highlighted that, despite a specified tempered-martensite microstructure, microstructural variations existed between different manufacturers and within a single batch. These microstructural variations not only affected the flow behaviour of the bolt material but determined the failure modes of <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> at ambient temperatures. Tensile testing of turned-down bolts allowed the temperature and strain-rate dependent flow behaviour of bolt material to be investigated, eliminating the effect of thread deformation. The flow curves obtained were input to a finite element model to represent true bolt material behaviour, which was validated against force-displacement curves obtained from uniaxial tensile testing of <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> from the same batch. Both experimental and finite element modelling work have highlighted the importance of using a tight thread tolerance class combination and a suitably tall nut to ensure ductile bolt breakage failures and avoid thread-stripping. ...|$|R

40|$|High {{strength}} preloadable bolts are {{key components}} influencing strength, stiffness and ductility of beam-to-column joints. In Europe the HV and HR systems are themost commonly used types of pre-loadable <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies.</b> EN 1993 - 1 - 8 provides design rules for bolted connections, without distinguishing {{the type of}} high strength preloadable bolt system. However, HV and HR are characterized by both different force-displacement responses and failure modes, which may significantly influence the performance of bolted joints under monotonic and cyclic actions, especially for seismic applications. The rational selection of the most suitable bolt type per specific structural demand may avoid premature reduction of joint strength for higher levels of joint rotation, or provide further rotational capacity. In order to investigate these features, experimental monotonic and both variable and constant amplitude cyclic inelastic tests were carried out on both HV and HR <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies,</b> varying the shank diameters. The monotonic tests enabled to identify the failure modes and the relevant force-displacement monotonic response and ductility per type of <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly.</b> The variable amplitude cyclic tests allowed quantifying the strength degradation induced by cyclic actions, while the constant amplitude low-cycle fatigue tests enabled to investigate the fatigue capacity at different threshold of plastic strain and to determine the strain-number of cycles (i. e. ε-N) curves.
