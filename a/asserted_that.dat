50|$|There exist vastly differing {{views on}} the moral basis of sovereignty. A {{fundamental}} polarity is between theories <b>that</b> <b>assert</b> <b>that</b> sovereignty is vested directly in the sovereign by divine or natural right and theories <b>that</b> <b>assert</b> it originates from the people. In the latter case there is a further division into those <b>that</b> <b>assert</b> <b>that</b> the people transfer their sovereignty to the sovereign (Hobbes), and those <b>that</b> <b>assert</b> <b>that</b> the people retain their sovereignty (Rousseau).|$|R

25|$|In a reified RDF database, each {{original}} statement, being a resource, itself, {{most likely}} {{has at least}} three additional statements made about it: one to <b>assert</b> <b>that</b> its subject is some resource, one to <b>assert</b> <b>that</b> its predicate is some resource, and one to <b>assert</b> <b>that</b> its object is some resource or literal. More statements about the original statement may also exist, depending on the application's needs.|$|R
6000|$|We {{have seen}} that a Proposition of Relation, {{beginning}} with [...] "Some," [...] <b>asserts</b> <b>that</b> some existing Things, being Members of its Subject, are also Members of its Predicate.

50|$|Inclusivism, one {{of several}} {{approaches}} to understanding the relationship between religions, <b>asserts</b> <b>that</b> while one set of beliefs is absolutely true, other sets of beliefs are at least partially true. It stands in contrast to exclusivism, which <b>asserts</b> <b>that</b> only one way is true and all others are in error. It is a particular form of religious pluralism, though that term may also <b>assert</b> <b>that</b> all beliefs are equally valid within a believer's particular context.|$|R

So why cannot I <b>assert</b> <b>that</b> it is so? ...|$|R

5|$|Branham {{became more}} {{controversial}} {{in his later}} years and this was particularly evident in his development of a theology that emphasized a few select doctrines.

Branham <b>asserted</b> <b>that</b> his doctrinal teachings were given to him by divine revelation.|$|E
5|$|Capturing bin Laden {{had been}} an {{objective}} of the U.S. government from the presidency of Bill Clinton {{until his death in}} 2011.

Khartoum's offer included detailed intelligence about the growing militancy of Hezbollah, Hamas, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and Iran's Revolutionary Guard, among other groups operating in the region. Ijaz further <b>asserted</b> <b>that</b> U.S. authorities allegedly rejected each offer despite knowing of bin Laden's involvement in training terrorists in Somalia, some of whom were allegedly involved in supporting militia members that downed U.S. Black Hawk helicopters in Mogadishu in October 1993. Any evidence of bin Laden's involvement in criminal activity against U.S. interests, such as training militia members who attacked U.S. troops in 1993, could have been grounds for indicting him far before Sudan expelled the Saudi fugitive in May 1996.|$|E
