5|$|A direct {{consequence}} of the invasion was the almost total elimination of the old English aristocracy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> English control over the Catholic Church in England. William systematically dispossessed English landowners and conferred their property on his continental followers. The Domesday Book meticulously documents {{the impact of this}} colossal programme of expropriation, revealing that by 1086 only about 5 per cent of land in England south of the Tees was left in English hands. Even this tiny residue was further diminished in the decades that followed, the elimination of native landholding being most complete in southern parts of the country.|$|E
5|$|Abd al-Rahman at {{this time}} was a {{flamboyant}} figure with broad popular support. His stature served to diminish that of the politicians, who were seen as his followers rather than as leaders. Abd al-Rahman could not afford a sudden British withdrawal, since that would {{open the door for}} an Egyptian take-over <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> his power. The British also were against an Egyptian take-over, but for different reasons. Yet Abd al-Rahman could not be seen as supporting an indefinite colonial status, and continued to promote independence. Abd al-Rahman and the British were engaged in delicate and unstable arrangements characterized by mutual distrust.|$|E

5|$|During Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, {{parts and}} {{remnants}} of the storm reached Presque Isle. The park was closed in preparation of the storm and waves for 14 – 18 feet were called for, along with high winds. The storm {{was expected to be}} severe, but luckily was not. Only 8 foot waves were recorded and not as high of winds either.

It had been planned to send this force to France to serve alongside the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), but France had fallen {{by the time the}} Australians arrived in Scotland on 16 June 1940, so they remained in the United Kingdom to help defend against a possible German cross-Channel invasion, which was feared following the capture of part of the BEF in France <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> much of its equipment.|$|E

Chartrand estimates the number of British killed (or died of their wounds) at about 1,000 for the main battle, with about 1,500 wounded.

During the 2005–2014 petrodollar surge, OPEC member Venezuela played a similar role supporting Cuba and other regional allies, before the 2014–2017 oil downturn brought Venezuela to its own economic crisis.|$|E
5|$|Historians have divided {{views on}} Stefansson's {{decision}} to leave the ship. Some of the voyage's survivors were critical of his seeming indifference to their ordeal <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> their comrades. He escaped official censure, and was publicly honoured for his later work on the expedition despite the Canadian government's reservations about its overall management. Although Bartlett was criticised by an admiralty commission for taking Karluk into the ice, he was hailed as a hero by the public and by his former Karluk shipmates.|$|E

5|$|In Spain, the red-billed chough has {{recently}} expanded its range by utilising old buildings, with 1,175 breeding pairs in a mi) study area. These new breeding areas usually surround the original montane core areas. However, the populations with nest sites on buildings {{are threatened by}} human disturbance, persecution <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> old buildings. Fossils of both chough species {{were found in the}} mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E

5|$|Political {{analysts have}} {{suggested}} {{several reasons for}} this victory, including the popularity of Modi, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> support for the Congress due to the corruption scandals in its previous term.
