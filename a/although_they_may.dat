5|$|A further type of (mostly strong red and yellow) {{emergence}} {{has recently}} been discovered in a few Australian species (D. hartmeyerorum, D. indica). Their function is not known yet, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> help in attracting prey.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Marlowe's Hero and Leander and Dido, Queen of Carthage, both similar stories {{written in}} Shakespeare's day, {{are thought to}} be less of a direct influence, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have helped create an {{atmosphere}} in which tragic love stories could thrive.|$|E
5|$|Only {{birds that}} are {{considered}} to have established, self-sustaining, wild populations are included on this list. This means that birds {{that are considered}} probable escapees, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have been sighted flying free, are not included.|$|E
5|$|Some {{nuthatch}}es, {{such as the}} Eurasian nuthatch and the North American species, {{have extensive}} ranges and large populations, and few conservation problems, <b>although</b> locally <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be affected by woodland fragmentation. In contrast, {{some of the more}} restricted species face severe pressures.|$|R
50|$|Diktyoma, or {{ciliary body}} medulloepithelioma, or teratoneuroma, {{is a rare}} tumor arising from {{primitive}} medullary epithelium in the ciliary body of the eye. Almost all diktyomas arise in the ciliary body, <b>although,</b> rarely, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> arise from the optic nerve head or retina.|$|R
50|$|Some {{nuthatch}}es, {{such as the}} Eurasian nuthatch and the North American species, {{have extensive}} ranges and large populations, and few conservation problems, <b>although</b> locally <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be affected by woodland fragmentation. In contrast, {{some of the more}} restricted species face severe pressures.|$|R
5|$|The first {{roads in}} the Peak were {{constructed}} by the Romans, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have followed existing tracks. The Roman network {{is thought to have}} linked the settlements and forts of Aquae Arnemetiae (Buxton), Chesterfield, Ardotalia (Glossop) and Navio (Brough and Shatton), and extended outwards to Danum (Doncaster), Mamucium (Manchester) and Derventio (Little Chester, near Derby). Parts of the modern A515 and A53 roads south of Buxton are believed to run along Roman roads.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{uniformity}} {{through different}} LARP games, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have similar styles, no one LARP {{will follow the}} exact same rules and regulations. Each individual game will provide a specific rule set located in the LARP's handbook. There are many variations of combat in LARPs, however, they fall under archetypes.|$|E
5|$|This bird always forages in groups, {{which are}} larger in winter than summer, and have {{constant}} composition in each season. Where food resources are restricted, adults dominate young birds, and males outrank females. Foraging areas change altitudinally through the year, depending on climatic factors, food availability and food quality. During the breeding season, birds remain above the tree line, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> use food provided by tourists at refuges and picnic areas.|$|E
50|$|The modern male {{stripper}} show {{usually involves}} full nudity, <b>although</b> sometimes <b>they</b> <b>may</b> retain underwear, especially g-strings, bikini briefs or thongs throughout the show, or only remove all clothing {{for a brief}} time. Performances are usually fully choreographed, involve dance routines and a costume of some sort.|$|R
50|$|Large {{automation}} systems {{also require}} an architect and much engineering talent. If the engineered system {{is large and}} complex enough, the systems architect may defer to a hardware architect and a software architect for parts of the job, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> all <b>may</b> be members of a joint architectural team.|$|R
50|$|Additions across pi bonds {{appear to}} proceed by typical {{nucleophilic}} addition pathways in most cases. Alkyl-, aryl-, and heteroaryllithium reagents add to azides to afford triazene salts. Reduction of these salts leads to amines, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> also <b>may</b> {{be converted to}} azides upon acidic workup with overall elimination of sulfinic acid.|$|R
5|$|Triceratops were herbivorous, {{and because}} of their low head, their primary food was {{probably}} low growth, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> {{have been able to}} knock down taller plants with their horns, beak, and bulk. The jaws were tipped with a deep, narrow beak, believed to have been better at grasping and plucking than biting.|$|E
5|$|Analyses of extinct adapiforms postcranial skeletons {{suggest a}} variety of {{locomotor}} behavior. The European adapids Adapis, Palaeolemur, and Leptadapis shared adaptations for slow climbing like the lorises, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have been quadrupedal runners like small New World monkeys. Both Notharctus and Smilodectes from North America and Europolemur from Europe exhibit limb proportions and joint surfaces comparable to vertical clinging and leaping lemurs, but were not as specialized as indriids for vertical clinging, suggesting that they ran along branches and did not leap as much. Notharctids Cantius and Pronycticebus {{appear to have been}} agile arboreal quadrupeds, with adaptations comparable to the brown lemurs.|$|E
5|$|Antigonid Macedonian kings {{relied on}} various {{regional}} officials to conduct affairs of state. This included high-ranking municipal officials, {{such as the}} military strategos and the politarch, i.e. the elected governor (archon) of a large city (polis), {{as well as the}} politico-religious office of the epistates. No evidence exists about the personal backgrounds of these officials, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have been chosen among the same group of aristocratic philoi and hetairoi who filled vacancies for army officers.|$|E
2500|$|The focus {{particles}} are particles which follow the left periphery ("forephrase" [...] per Leer) of a sentence. The Naish-Story term {{for them is}} [...] "post-marginals". Many may be suffixed with a demonstrative (-yá, -hé, -wé, -yú), also <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be combined with the interrogative (-gé). Focus {{particles are}} stylistically written as separate words, <b>although</b> phonetically <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be indivisible from the preceding utterance.|$|R
50|$|Large {{hardware}} systems {{also require}} an architect and much engineering talent. If the engineered system {{is large and}} complex enough, the chief hardware systems architect may defer to subordinate architects for parts of the job, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> all <b>may</b> be members of a joint architectural team. But the architect must never {{be viewed as an}} engineering supervisor.|$|R
30|$|We have {{obtained}} an expression {{for the power}} allocation that is still highly complex. However, this procedure gives us an insight on how to build alternative simplified schemes {{based on the same}} idea of the well-known WF. <b>Although</b> suboptimal, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> perform close to the optimal solution, with the advantage of a much lower optimization burden.|$|R
5|$|Crude glyphs {{have been}} found on a few stone objects and some {{additional}} wooden items, {{but most of these}} are thought to be fakes created for the early tourism market. Several of the 26 wooden texts are suspect due to uncertain provenance (X, Y, and Z), poor quality craftsmanship (F, K, V, W, Y, and Z), or to having been carved with a steel blade (K, V, and Y), and thus, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> prove to be genuine, should not be trusted in initial attempts at decipherment. Z resembles many early forgeries in not being boustrophedon, but it may be a palimpsest on an authentic but now illegible text.|$|E
5|$|Dentin is a mineralized {{connective}} tissue with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins. Dentin has microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum or enamel border. The diameter of these tubules range from 2.5 μm near the pulp, to 1.2 μm in the midportion, and 900nm near the dentino-enamel junction. <b>Although</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have tiny side-branches, the tubules do not intersect with each other. Their length is {{dictated by the}} radius of the tooth. The three dimensional configuration of the dentinal tubules is genetically determined.|$|E
5|$|Doppler {{redshift}} vs cosmological red-shift: Astronomersoften {{refer to}} the cosmological red-shift as a normal Doppler shift,which is a misconception. Although similar, the cosmological red-shift is not identical to the Doppler redshift. The Doppler redshift is based on special relativity, which does not consider the expansion of space. On the contrary, the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity, in which the expansion of space is considered. <b>Although</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> appear identical for nearby galaxies, it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the Doppler redshift.|$|E
50|$|Although Ultimate X matches are {{considered}} no-disqualification, interference {{and the use}} of weapons are rare. Wrestlers are not allowed to use a ladder as a way to grab the object, <b>although</b> technically <b>they</b> <b>may</b> use one as a weapon. In Ultimate X14, however, Team 3D got away with using a ladder because the referee was knocked out.|$|R
50|$|Although the Akbash is {{frequently}} mistakenly {{referred to as}} being a herding dog, they do not chase and round up livestock. Akbash Dogs should never chase livestock <b>although</b> occasionally <b>they</b> <b>may</b> move their charges away from danger. The Akbash Dog {{is one of the}} more popular of about 30 breeds worldwide of Flock Guardians, Livestock Protection Dogs, or Livestock Guardian Dogs (LGDs).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Keloids are benign hyperproliferative growths of dermal {{collagen}} {{that usually}} result from excessive tissue response to skin trauma. <b>Although</b> benign, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> {{be seen as}} a painful and/or pruritic lesions. A 15 -year-young boy was admitted to our clinic with an enlarged scar and pain on the penis for about 1 year after a routine circumcision operation. Complete surgical resection of the lesion was done and histopathological examination revealed keloid of the penis...|$|R
5|$|Her name {{given at}} birth was Yalurrngali: Peggy Rockman was a name {{subsequently}} {{given to her}} by white administrators. 'Napaljarri' (in Warlpiri) or 'Napaltjarri' (in Western Desert dialects) is a skin name, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and {{may be associated with}} particular totems. <b>Although</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans. Thus 'Peggy Rockman' is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers.|$|E
5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not always be visible.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia levis is one {{of several}} species of Persoonia that {{regenerate}} by resprouting from the trunk after bushfire, an adaptation to the fire-prone habitat in which it grows. Its thick papery bark shields the underlying epicormic buds from the flames. Plants also regenerate by seedlings that arise from a seedbank in the soil after fire, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> take up to 12months to germinate. One study of sclerophyll forest unburnt for thirty years showed P.levis had declined over time. P.levis plants can live for over 60years, and their leaves have a lifespan of up to 6years.|$|E
40|$|Rigid {{frameworks}} in some Euclidian {{space are}} embedded graphs having a unique local realization (up to Euclidian motions) for the given edge lengths, <b>although</b> globally <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have several. We study {{the number of}} distinct planar embeddings of minimally rigid graphs with n vertices. We show that, modulo planar rigid motions, this number is at most. We also exhibit several families which realize lower bounds {{of the order of}} 2 ^n [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{compartment}} syndromes in {{the lower}} leg are well recognized following major trauma. However, <b>although</b> rare, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> occur following seemingly minor sporting injury. A case of acute compartment syndrome, following a football game and affecting the peroneal or lateral compartment, is described, in which prompt diagnosis and treatment led to a satisfactory outcome. The diagnosis and surgical management of acute compartment syndromes are discussed. Early recognition and treatment are important {{in the prevention of}} long-term disability...|$|R
50|$|Passenger {{services}} {{on the town}} railway stopped on 1 June 1975, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> resumed in <b>May</b> 1993, before being finally closed on 2 June 1996. A year later, on 31 October 1997, freight traffic also ended on the town railway, so that Zeulenroda unt Bf again operated as a through station.|$|R
5|$|The Byzantines were {{surrounded}} {{from all sides}} now. Some fell into the deep ravines off the steep slopes, others tried to escape in the waters, only to be smashed on the rocks below and again others were killed in their flight. Nevertheless, {{a large number of}} the soldiers managed to escape the slaughter. Jonah, the Greek informant of the Rashidun army during the conquest of Damascus, died in this battle. The Muslims took no prisoners in this battle, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have captured some during the subsequent pursuit.|$|E
5|$|The willie wagtail {{is almost}} always on the move and rarely still {{for more than a}} few moments during {{daylight}} hours. Even while perching it will flick its tail from side to side, twisting about looking for prey. Birds are mostly encountered singly or in pairs, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> gather in small flocks. Unlike other fantails, much of its time is spent on the ground. It beats its wings deeply in flight, interspersed with a swift flying dip. It characteristically wags its tail upon landing after a short dipping flight.|$|E
5|$|Unique among North American {{professional}} team sports, the National Hockey League (NHL) {{and most}} minor professional leagues in North America do not eject players outright for fighting (<b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> {{do so for}} more flagrant violations {{as part of a}} fight) but major European and collegiate hockey leagues do, and multi-game suspensions may be added on top of the ejection. Therefore, the vast majority of fights occur in the NHL and other North American professional leagues.|$|E
50|$|Thrillers {{take place}} mostly in {{ordinary}} suburbs and cities, <b>although</b> sometimes <b>they</b> <b>may</b> take place wholly or partly in exotic settings such as foreign cities, deserts, polar regions, or the high seas. These usually tough, resourceful, but essentially ordinary heroes are pitted against villains determined to destroy them, their country, or {{the stability of}} the free world. Often in a thriller movie, the protagonist is faced with what seem to be insurmountable problems in his mission, carried out against a ticking clock, the stakes are high and <b>although</b> resourceful, <b>they</b> face personal dilemmas along the way forcing them to make sacrifices for others.|$|R
5000|$|Much of the {{criticism}} favorable to this New Journalism came from the writers themselves. Talese and Wolfe, in a panel discussion cited earlier, asserted that, <b>although</b> what <b>they</b> wrote <b>may</b> look like fiction, it was indeed reporting: [...] "Fact reporting, leg work," [...] Talese called it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{volunteer}} fire department {{in a small}} Czechoslovak town decides to organize a ball in a townhall with raffle and a beauty pageant. The firefighters also plan to present a small ceremonial fire axe as the birthday gift to their retired chairman who has cancer (<b>although</b> <b>they</b> believe he <b>may</b> not know of it).|$|R
