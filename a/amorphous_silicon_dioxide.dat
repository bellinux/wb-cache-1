40|$|Surface phonon-polaritons are hybrid {{electromagnetic}} modes {{that are}} the result of photons coupling to transverse optical phonons. Recently, these surface modes have received much renewed interest primarily {{due to the fact that}} micro-fabrication techniques can now routinely create structures at the length scales of interest (nanometers to microns). This thesis investigates the transmission of energy mediated by surface phonon-polaritons. First, the heat flux transported along the in-plane direction of a thin film is explored. A kinetic theory-based calculation is performed using a diffusion approximation. These results are further confirmed by simulations using fluctuational electrodynamics. It was found that for <b>amorphous</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>dioxide</b> films tens of nanometers thick, the in-plane heat flux carried by surface phonon-polaritons can exceed the heat flux carried by phonons in the film. The results also show that the effective thermal conductivity due to surface polaritons increases with decreasing film thickness, offering a method to potentially offset the reduction in thermal conductivity due to increased interface scattering of phonons in crystalline thin films. Both calculations point to the propagation length of the surface phonon-polariton as the source for the large heat flux. An experimental measurement of the surface phononpolariton propagation length on <b>amorphous</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>dioxide</b> is performed using attenuated total reflection and is found to agree well with the calculated value. The last part of this thesis examines the energy transmission in the direction normal to the plane of the film. Specifically, the transmission of light through an <b>amorphous</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>dioxide</b> film perforated by sub-wavelength holes is experimentally measured. A five-fold increase through the perforated film versus through a solid film is observed in discrete frequency ranges, which strongly suggests the involvement of surface phonon-polaritons. by Dye-Zone A.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{mechanisms}} of carbonation of clay minerals, such as bentonite, kaolinite, and soft clay, we exposed them to supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) /water at temperatures of 200 and 250 C and pressures of 1500 and 2000 psi for 72 - and 107 -hours. Bentonite, comprising three crystalline phases, montmorillonite (MMT), anorthoclase-type albite, and quartz was susceptible to reactions with ionic carbonic acid yielded by the interactions between scCO 2 and water, particularly MMT and anorthoclase-type albite phases. For MMT, the cation-exchangeable ions, such as Na+ and Ca 2 +, present in its basal interplanar space, were replaced by proton, H+, from ionic carbonic acid; thereafter, the cations leaching from MMT directly reacted with CO 32 - as a counter ion of H+ to form carbonate compounds. Such in-situ carbonation process in basal space caused the shrinkage and breakage of the spacing structure within MMT. In contrast, the wet carbonation of anorthoclase-type albite, categorized as rock minerals, entailed the formation of three amorphous by-products, such as carbonates, kaolinite-like compounds, and <b>silicon</b> <b>dioxide.</b> Together, these two different carbonations caused the disintegration and corruption of bentonite. Kaolinite clay containing the <b>amorphous</b> carbonates and <b>silicon</b> <b>dioxide</b> was inert to wet carbonation.
