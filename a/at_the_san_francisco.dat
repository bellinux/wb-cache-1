5|$|Public {{and artistic}} {{opinion of the}} new pieces was, and remains, mixed. In 1915, Mint {{officials}} began plans to replace them, after the design's minimum term expired in 1916.

Most dates in the Barber coin series are not difficult to obtain, but the 1894 dime struck <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> Mint (1894-S), with a mintage of 24, is a great rarity.|$|E

During this time, he also took a variety of side jobs, including a stevedore <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> docks, a motorman, and briefly as a patrolman for the Berkeley Police Department, where he worked under police chief August Vollmer.
