5|$|The {{original}} moat {{around the}} tower {{would have been}} a simple design, but it was redesigned in the 1460s to provide a walkway around the outside of the Great Tower. The niches in the walls of the walkway are of 17th-century origin, and would originally have held classical statues - the walkway would have provided <b>a</b> <b>dignified</b> way of admiring the Great Tower. It is likely that fish would have been bred in the moat.|$|E
5|$|According to {{generally}} accepted standards of respect, the national flag {{should never be}} dipped to any person or thing. Care {{should be taken to}} prevent the flag from touching the ground, floor or water beneath it. It should be also secured from being torn off or falling to the ground and it should not be flown outdoors during a heavy rain, blizzard or very strong wind. The flag should never be flown dirty, torn or faded. When no longer in a fit condition to be used, it should be disposed of in <b>a</b> <b>dignified</b> manner, preferably by cutting it in half so as to separate the colors and then, burning.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{believed}} that kings should rule England in <b>a</b> <b>dignified</b> manner, surrounded by ceremony and ecclesiastical ritual. He thought that his predecessors had allowed {{the status of}} the Crown to decline, and sought to correct this during his reign. The events of the civil war in Henry's youth deeply affected the King, and he adopted Edward the Confessor as his patron saint, hoping to emulate {{the way in which the}} Anglo-Saxon King had brought peace to England and reunited his people in order and harmony. Henry tried to use his royal authority leniently, hoping to appease the more hostile barons and maintain peace in England.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} {{published}} illustrations, {{which may have}} been drawn by Raspe himself, the Baron appears slim and youthful. For the 1792 Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen, an anonymous artist drew the Baron as <b>a</b> <b>dignified</b> but tired old soldier whose face is marred by injuries from his adventures; this illustration remained the standard portrait of the Baron for about seventy years, and its imagery was echoed in Cruikshank's depictions of the character. Doré, illustrating a Théophile Gautier fils translation in 1862, retained the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache from the 1792 portrait, but gave the Baron a healthier and more affable appearance; the Doré Baron became the definitive visual representation for the character.|$|E
5|$|The {{activities}} of Periyar continued {{when he went}} to Bangalore in 1958 to participate in the All India Official Language Conference. There he stressed the need to retain English as the Union Official Language instead of Hindi. Five years later, Periyar travelled to North India to advocate the eradication of the caste system. Nearing Periyar's last years, an award was given to him by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and it was presented to him by the Union Education Minister, Triguna Sen in Madras (Chennai), on 27 June 1970. In his last meeting at Thiagaraya Nagar, Chennai on 19 December 1973, Periyar declared a call for action to gain social equality and <b>a</b> <b>dignified</b> way of life. On 24 December 1973, Periyar {{died at the age of}} 94.|$|E
5|$|Two {{statues of}} Riel {{are located in}} Winnipeg. One of the Winnipeg statues, the work of {{architect}} Étienne Gaboury and sculptor Marcien Lemay, depicts Riel as a naked and tortured figure. It was unveiled in 1970 {{and stood in the}} grounds of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for 23 years. After much outcry (especially from the Métis community) that the statue was an undignified misrepresentation, the statue was removed and placed at the Collège universitaire de Saint-Boniface. It was replaced in 1994 with a statue designed by Miguel Joyal depicting Riel as <b>a</b> <b>dignified</b> statesman. The unveiling ceremony was on 16 May 1996, in Winnipeg.|$|E

5|$|In January 1960 Heffron {{provided}} his {{old friend}} H. V. Evatt <b>a</b> <b>dignified</b> exit from federal politics by nominating him to succeed Sir Kenneth Street as Chief Justice of New South Wales. His Attorney General Reg Downing, however, was horrified, having favoured the senior puisne justice Sir William Owen as the most suitable candidate while also realising that Evatt's worsening health would render him less than equal {{to the task of}} chief justice. Therefore, while Downing, as attorney general, would normally be the person to move the nomination of chief justice in cabinet, he refused to do so, leaving Heffron to do it himself. Heffron's motion to nominate Evatt was passed narrowly by 8 votes to 6. Downing's concerns would come to pass as Evatt indeed proved highly ineffective, often wracked by mental and physical ill-health, was reduced to having most of his judgements written or co-written for him, and resigning in 1962 after only two years as chief justice.|$|E
5|$|In {{her work}} How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and Abortion, Susan Feldman argues that {{abortion}} should be defended according to Kantian ethics. She proposed {{that a woman}} {{should be treated as}} <b>a</b> <b>dignified</b> autonomous person, with control over their body, as Kant suggested. She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics, requiring abortion to be the mother's decision. Dean Harris has noted that, if Kantian ethics is {{to be used in the}} discussion of abortion, it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person. Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals. Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age (such as babies or fetuses) or mental disability, agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves, equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who served}} in {{government}} had a privileged position in Han society that was just one tier below the nobles (yet some high officials were also ennobled and had fiefs). They could not be arrested for crimes unless permission was granted by the emperor. However, when officials were arrested, they were imprisoned and fettered like commoners. Their punishments in court also had to gain {{the approval of the}} emperor. Officials were not exempt from execution, yet they were often given a chance to commit suicide as <b>a</b> <b>dignified</b> alternative. The most senior posts were the Three Excellencies—excluding the Grand Tutor, a post that was irregularly occupied. The individual titles and functions of the Three Excellencies changed from Western to Eastern Han. However, their annual salaries remained at 10,000 dan (石) of grain, largely commuted to payments in coin cash and luxury items like silk. Below them were the Nine Ministers, each of whom headed a major government bureau and earned 2,000 bushels a year. The lowest-paid government employees made Equivalent to 100 bushels annually. It was thought that wealthy officials would be less tempted by bribes. Therefore, {{in the beginning of the}} dynasty, having a total assessed taxable wealth of one hundred thousand coins was a prerequisite for holding office. This was reduced to forty thousand coins in 142 BCE, yet from Emperor Wu's reign onwards this policy was no longer enforced.|$|E
