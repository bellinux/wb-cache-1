5|$|Military {{strategy}} and military training {{were treated as}} sciences that could be studied and perfected; soldiers were tested in their skills of using weaponry and in their athletic ability. The troops were trained to follow signal standards to advance at the waving of banners and to halt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of bells and drums.|$|E
5|$|The Altar and the Door was {{produced}} by Mark A. Miller. Most of the recording {{and all of the}} mixing for the album was done by Sam Hewitt at Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee and My Refuge Studio in McDonough, Georgia; additional recording was done by Michael Hewitt and Dale Oliver at those same locations. The strings on The Altar and the Door were arranged by Bernie Herms and recorded by Bill Whittington and Steve Beers <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> Kitchen in Franklin, Tennessee. The album was mastered by Richard Dodd.|$|E

5|$|The Blood Beast alien costume {{was also}} {{previously}} {{used in the}} Roger Corman film Teenage Caveman (1958), which was filmed just two weeks earlier. Art director Daniel Haller, who built the rocket-ship and other props, slept <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> stage between work sessions. Following dissatisfaction with his treatment by the Cormans, Varno pursued two successful arbitration cases, {{one of which was}} for underpayment. The other was in response to Gene Corman's original story writing credit, even though Varno claimed to have written the entire story himself.|$|E
5|$|Many horses died as {{a result}} of the {{conditions}} at the front—of exhaustion, drowning, becoming mired in mud and falling in shell holes. Other horses were captured after their riders were killed. Horses also endured poor feeding and care, poison gas attacks that injured their respiratory systems and skin, and skin conditions such as mange. When gas warfare began in 1915, nose plugs were improvised for the horses to allow them to breathe during attacks. Later, several types of gas masks were developed by both the Central and Allied nations, although horses often confused them with feedbags and destroyed them. Soldiers found that better-bred horses were more likely to suffer from shell shock and act up when exposed to the sights and sounds of war than less-well-bred animals, who often learned to lie down and take cover <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of artillery fire. Veterinary hospitals were established to assist horses in recovering from shell shock and battle wounds, but thousands of equine corpses still lined the roads of the Western Front. In one year, 120,000horses were treated for wounds or disease by British veterinary hospitals alone. Ambulances and field veterinary hospitals were required to care for the horses, and horse trailers were first developed for use on the Western Front as equine ambulances. Disease was also a major issue for horses at the front, with equine influenza, ringworm, sand colic, sores from fly bites, and anthrax among the illnesses that affected them. British Army Army Veterinary Corps hospitals treated 725,216 horses over the course of the war, successfully healing 529,064. Horses were moved from the front to veterinary hospitals by several methods of transportation, including on foot, by rail and by barge. During the last months of the war, barges were considered ideal transportation for horses suffering wounds from shells and bombs.|$|E
5|$|Soubise has {{historically}} taken {{the blame for}} the loss, but this may be an unfair assessment. While he did owe his rank to his good relationship with Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of King Louis XV, he was neither blessed with extraordinary military acumen nor with the best troops: he could do nothing about the former, and most of the latter were with Louis Charles César Le Tellier, fighting in the Rhineland. Under Soubise's command, the French had conducted a notorious march across Germany, characterized by persistent pillaging. His army also had approximately 12,000 civilian camp followers. There were chefs, hair dressers, perruquiers, barbers, wives and mistresses, pastry chefs, tailors and clothiers of all kinds, saddle makers, bridle makers, grooms, and servants of all varieties who served the nobility. In addition, the army had its usual motley crew of farriers, grooms, veterinarians, surgeons, and cooks that sustained an army on the march. After the battle, the Comte de Saint Germain, who had commanded the advanced guard and also the rear guard that struggled {{to keep up with the}} fleeing army, complained that the troops in his charge had been defective, a gang of robbers, murders, and cowards who ran <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a gunshot.|$|E

25|$|Before too long, Irvine and Lunny {{participated in}} a project {{that would lead to}} their big break. Moore, who had moved to England during the National Bank Strike of 1966, had become an {{established}} musician in the English folk music scene and even recorded his first album (Paddy on the Road) there, in 1969, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sound</b> Techniques studio in Chelsea.|$|E
25|$|A wholehearted cricketer who bustled about {{whatever}} he did, Brearley's batting fame rested on his hurried {{walk to the}} wicket and the much-told Old Trafford story that, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of him scurrying to the wicket, the horse walked between the shafts of the heavy roller ready {{for the end of}} the innings. In all cricket, he took 844 wickets but scored only 908 runs.|$|E
25|$|As in 1859 winners {{received}} a cash prize; in addition, {{the first three}} winners received olive wreaths and small branches of olive and laurel. There was a band playing an Olympic Hymn, specially composed for the occasion. The judges were professors of the University of Athens, {{and there was a}} herald for announcing the winners. King George I was awarding the prizes to the winners <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the music.|$|E

25|$|On 6 December 2008 Crowded House {{played the}} Homebake festival in Sydney, with warm up gigs at small venues in Hobart, Melbourne and Sydney. For these shows the band were {{augmented}} by multi-instrumentalist Don McGlashan and Neil's younger son, Elroy Finn, on guitar. On 14 March 2009 the band joined Neil's older son, Liam Finn, on stage for three songs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sound</b> Relief concert in Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|In March 2009, Eskimo Joe {{performed}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sound</b> Relief {{concert at}} the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Appearing with Eskimo Joe at the Sydney concert were, Coldplay, Hoodoo Gurus, Icehouse, Jet, Josh Pyke, Little Birdy, The Presets, Wolfmother, You Am I and additional artists. Prior to the benefit concert the band played in Perth as The Andy Callison Project.|$|E
25|$|This done, the shepherds and shepherdesses made merry {{with these}} cakes and fine grapes, and sported {{themselves}} together <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the pretty small pipe, scoffing and laughing at those vainglorious cake-bakers, who had that day {{met with a}} mischief for want of crossing themselves with a good hand in the morning. Nor did they forget to apply to Forgier's leg some fat chenin grapes, and so handsomely dressed it and bound it up that he was quickly cured.|$|E

50|$|A reissue of {{the album}} was {{released}} on September 28, 2010 with only the original 14 tracks, with a slightly different album cover design and an accompanying DVD of their performance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> of <b>the</b> Underground festival in July 2005.|$|R
25|$|Despite his sacking Taylor {{remained}} {{friendly with}} the band and he {{asked if he could}} come to Paris too. He dressed up for the sound check in his trademark black leather stage gear, and added a chain around his neck with a Joan of Arc medallion, which he had bought on arrival at Calais. One version of the story says he gave such an extraordinary performance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> check, that the organizers decided to put Taylor {{at the top of the}} bill for both shows. As a result of his performance at those two shows, Eddie Barclay signed him to a six-year record deal on the Barclay label.|$|E
25|$|A yearly event {{which had}} been held {{since the start of}} the Dean Blundell Show, Sausagefest was a summertime {{backyard}} barbecue-style event which was typically held <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sound</b> Academy venue and emceed by the hosts of the show. It featured artists and bands (different each year) performing on the stage inside, while drinks and barbecued food were sold outside. With the sudden departure of long-time Dean Blundell Show co-host Todd Shapiro, no Sausagefest was held in the summer of 2013. The cancellation of the Dean Blundell Show and firing of Blundell in January of the following year, meant that the final Sausagefest had been held in the summer of 2012.|$|E
25|$|The album's {{original}} mix, {{recorded in}} Detroit at both Hitsville and Golden World {{as well as}} United Sound Studios, was finalized on April 5, 1971. When Gordy listened to the mix, he cautioned Gaye of the album's potential of possibly alienating Gaye's core fan base, which was mostly women; however, Gaye refused to budge. Gaye and his engineers did a new sound mix of the album <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> Factory in West Hollywood in early May, integrating the orchestra somewhat closer with the rhythm tracks. Though Motown's Quality Control department team feared no other hit released from the album due to its concurrent style with each song leading to the next, Gordy surprisingly allowed this mix to be released that month.|$|E
