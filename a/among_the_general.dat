More rigorous public polls taken during 2006 showed an increasing {{majority of the}} population, up to 80%, supporting the introduction of some partnership rights for same-sex couples, with a slim majority favouring full marriage. The numbers in favour of adoption by same-sex couples were lower but less clear.|$|E
5|$|One poll {{reported}} in the journal Nature showed that among American scientists (across various disciplines), about 40 percent believe in both evolution and an active deity (theistic evolution). This {{is similar to the}} results reported for surveys of the general American public. Also, about 40 percent of the scientists polled believe in a God that answers prayers, and believe in immortality. While about 55% of scientists surveyed were atheists, agnostics, or nonreligious theists, atheism is far from universal among scientists who support evolution, or <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> public that supports evolution. Very similar results were reported from a 1997 Gallup Poll of the American public and scientists.|$|E

5|$|The aim of {{the revolt}} was to inspire a wider {{uprising}} <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> populace {{in an attempt to}} overthrow the colonial regime and establish independence. The VNQDĐ had previously attempted to engage in clandestine activities to undermine French rule, but increasing French scrutiny on their activities led to their leadership group taking the risk of staging a large scale military attack in the Red River Delta in northern Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{members of the}} Sicilian aristocracy who still inhabit their ancestral palazzi are unable to make opening their houses to tourism {{a major source of}} income, unlike some Northern, especially English, counterparts. The local equivalent of the National Trust is very small, and there is much less local interest <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> population. The Princes, Marquesses, and Counts of Sicily still living in their houses dwell in splendid isolation, surrounded often by beauty and decay. It is only today both owners and the state are awakening to the possibility that if action is not taken soon it will be too late to save this particular part of the Sicilian heritage.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{movements}} <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> self-harm community to make self-harm itself and treatment better known {{to mental health}} professionals, {{as well as the}} general public. For example, March 1 is designated as Self-injury Awareness Day (SIAD) around the world. On this day, some people choose to be more open about their own self-harm, and awareness organizations make special efforts to raise awareness about self-harm. Some people wear an orange awareness ribbon or wristband to encourage awareness of self-harm.|$|E

These were organizations advocating {{for the inclusion of}} people with Down syndrome into the general school system and for a greater understanding of the condition <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> population, as well as groups providing support for families with children living with Down syndrome. Before this individuals with Down syndrome were often placed in mental hospitals or asylums. Organizations included the Royal Society for Handicapped Children and Adults founded in the UK in 1946 by Judy Fryd, Kobato Kai founded in Japan in 1964, the National Down Syndrome Congress founded in the United States in 1973 by Kathryn McGee and others, and the National Down Syndrome Society founded in 1979 in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Al-Azhar {{also served}} as a focal point for protests against the Ottoman {{occupation}} of Egypt, both from within the ulema and from <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> public. Student protests at al-Azhar were common, and shops {{in the vicinity of the}} mosque would often close out of solidarity with the students. The ulema was also on occasion able to defy the government. In one instance, in 1730–31, Ottoman aghas harassed the residents living near al-Azhar while pursuing three fugitives. The gates at al-Azhar were closed in protest and the Ottoman governor, fearing a larger uprising, ordered the aghas to refrain from going near al-Azhar. Another disturbance occurred in 1791 in which the wāli harassed the people near the al-Hussein Mosque, who then went to al-Azhar to demonstrate. The wāli was subsequently dismissed from his post.|$|E
5|$|Current {{research}} suggests that the rates of self-harm are much higher among young people with the average age of onset between 14 and 24. The earliest reported incidents of self-harm are in children between 5 and 7 years old. In the UK in 2008 rates of self-harm in young people could be as high as 33%. In addition there appears to be an increased risk of self-harm in college students than <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> population. In a study of undergraduate students in the US, 9.8% of the students surveyed indicated that they had purposefully cut or burned themselves on at least one occasion in the past. When the definition of self-harm was expanded to include head-banging, scratching oneself, and hitting oneself along with cutting and burning, 32% of the sample said they had done this. In Ireland, a study found that instances of hospital-treated self-harm were much higher in city and urban districts, than in rural settings. The CASE (Child & Adolescent Self-harm in Europe) study suggests that the life-time risk of self-injury is ~1:7 for women and ~1:25 for men.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes {{in response to the}} epidemic, convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection. Although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from HIV, {{women are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners, who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, Roberts {{has been}} a strong proponent of raising the image of {{motorcycle}} racing <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> public. During his riding career, he {{made a point of}} returning to the United States during the mid-season break in the Grand Prix calendar to race in the Laguna Seca 200 as a way to increase the profile of the event in order for it to gain Grand Prix status. The race eventually attained Grand Prix status in 1988 and in 1993, Roberts took on the role of promoter, providing financial backing for the 1993 United States Grand Prix. In the 1990s when Grand Prix racing faced diminishing numbers of competitors due to increasing costs, Roberts demanded that Yamaha provide engines to privateer teams in order to bolster the number of racers.|$|E
5|$|With a stocky, {{powerful}} build, the Exmoor pony {{is strong}} for its height, and {{noted for its}} hardiness and endurance. The chest is deep and the back broad, the croup level. The legs are short, with good bone and hard hooves. Although many sources state that the Exmoor has a distinctly different jaw structure from other horse breeds, which includes the beginnings of development of a seventh molar, this is a misunderstanding based on an incorrect translation of a German study. The study, when properly translated, refers to a feature, found in multiple horse breeds and perhaps all animals with sizable lower jaws, {{that appears to be}} an extra branch of blood supply in the area. While an extra tooth may have eventually developed from this extra blood supply, its frequency <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> horse population makes its appearance in the Exmoor pony unremarkable.|$|E
