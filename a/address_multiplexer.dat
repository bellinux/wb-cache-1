A few were further expanded to 128 kB, 256 kB, or 512 kB, with home-built memory controllers/memory management units (MMUs).|$|E

40|$|Teaching the {{practical}} aspects of device and chip design in New Zealand presents many problems, including high manufacturing costs, long lead times, {{and the lack}} of local industry strength. Nonetheless, it is possible to overcome these issues. This paper describes the courses in these areas at the University of Canterbury, including a practical IC design project that has been running successfully for the past four years. The IC design project takes final year students through a full custom design using modern design tools and fabrication processes. The design is quite straightforward — a 4 -bit arithmetic logic unit — but it emphasises the importance of design, simulation and testing. The final circuits contain a few hundred transistors, so good practice is essential. Twelve designs are integrated on to a single chip to keep costs down, and individual designs are <b>addressed</b> via <b>multiplexers.</b> The designs are fabricated using a 0. 5 micron process, accessed through a multi-project vendor (MOSIS). Getting chips back from a manufacturer is significantly more motivating for the students than just performing a paper design...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a great}} {{diversity}} in the transmission technologies in current data networks. Individual technologies are in most cases incompatible at physical and partially also at the link layer of the reference ISO/OSI model. Network compatibility, {{as the ability to}} transmit data, is realizable through the third layer, which is able to guarantee the operation of the different devices across their technological differences. The proposed inverse packet <b>multiplexer</b> <b>addresses</b> increase of the speed and reliability of packet transmission to the third layer, {{and at the same time}} it increases the stability of the data communication by the regulation of the delay value during the transmission. This article presents implementation of a communication system and its verification in real conditions. The conclusion compares the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed control system...|$|R
5000|$|Motorola's MC6847 Video Display Generator (VDG) chip was {{released}} {{about the same}} time as the joint venture started and it has been speculated that the VDG was actually designed for this project. At the core of the prototype [...] "Green Thumb" [...] terminal, the MC6847, along with the MC6809 microprocessor unit (MPU), made the prototype a reality by about 1978. Unfortunately, the prototype contained too many chips to be commercially viable. Motorola solved this problem by integrating all the functions of the many smaller chips into one chip, the MC6883 Synchronous <b>Address</b> <b>Multiplexer</b> (SAM). By that time in late 1979, the new and powerful Motorola MC6809 processor {{was released}}. The SAM, VDG, and 6809 were combined and the AgVision terminal was born.|$|E
50|$|The Dragon 32 and 64 {{computers}} were British cousins of the CoCo {{based on a}} reference design from Motorola that was produced as an exemplar of {{the capabilities of the}} MC6809E (MPU) when coupled with the MC6847 (Video Display Generator - VDG) and the MC6883 (Synchronous <b>Address</b> <b>Multiplexer</b> - SAM). The BIOS code for the Dragon 32 was rewritten based on specifications and API drawn up by Microsoft and, to a certain extent, PA Consulting of Cambridge. The Dragon was a much improved unit with video output in addition to the TV output of the CoCo and CoCo 2. It also featured a Centronics parallel port (not present on any CoCo), an integrated 6551A serial UART (on the Dragon 64), and a higher-quality keyboard. In 1983, a version of the Dragon was licensed for manufacture for the North American market by Tano Corporation of New Orleans, Louisiana. Tano started production at their 48000 sq ft facility in September 83 and were running at capacity just one month later. Unfortunately sales weren't as good as expected and Tano stopped production and support just one year later. A California surplus equipment company, California Digital, bought the remaining stock of Tano built Dragon 64 shortly after and has had new in-the-box Dragon 64s available for purchase as of January 2017.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, countless bioelectronic {{monitoring}} systems were {{developed for the}} analysis of cells as well as complex tissues. Most studies addressed the sensitivity and specificity of the bioelectronic detection method in comparison to classical molecular biological assays. In contrast, the up scaling as a prerequisite for the practical application of these novel bioelectronic monitoring systems is mostly only discussed theoretically. In this context, we developed a novel 384 -multiwell microelectrode array (MMEA) based measurement system for the sensitive label-free real-time monitoring of neurodegenerative processes by impedance spectroscopy. With respect to the needs of productive screening systems for robust and reproducible measurements on high numbers of plates, we focused on reducing the critical contacting of more than 400 electrodes for a 384 -MMEA. Therefore, we introduced an on top array of immersive counter electrodes that are individually <b>addressed</b> by a <b>multiplexer</b> and connected all measurement electrodes on the 384 -MMEA to a single contact point. More strikingly, our novel approach provided a comparable signal stability and sensitivity similar to an array with integrated counter electrodes. Next, we optimized a SH-SY 5 Y cell based tauopathy model by introducing a novel 5 -fold Tau mutation eliminating the need of artificial tauopathy induction. In combination with our novel 384 -MMEA based measurement system, the concentration and time dependent neuroregenerative effect of the kinase inhibitor SRN- 003 - 556 could be quantitatively monitored. Thus, our novel screening system could be a useful tool to identify and develop potential novel therapeutics in the field of Tau-related neurodegenerative diseases...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} complex biological systems requires {{information about the}} functional state of proteins, which perform the bulk {{of work in the}} cell. Proteomics currently {{plays a major role in}} many areas of biomedicine, such as the identification of cancer biomarkers. The ability to directly interrogate protein interactions is therefore of major importance. In particular, label-free high throughput protein analysis methods allowing quantitative detection are highly desirable. Field-effect devices are promising candidates for the development of inexpensive microarrays associated with portable instrumentation. These stable semiconductor devices measure variations in the open circuit potential (OCP) that occur at the metal gate interface when the charge density and distribution of the immobilised biolayer changes upon interaction with a bioconjugate. We here report on the parallel electrical detection of protein interactions using direct multiplexed OCP variation measurements. The OCP was measured in real-time using an ultra-low input bias current instrumentation amplifier providing an accurate differential measurement of voltage. An array of sensor inputs is switched in high speed via a <b>multiplexer</b> <b>addressed</b> by a microcontroller. The microcontroller converts the OCP differential measurements from analog to digital, displays real-time information on a LCD display, and transfers the captured data by User Datagram Protocol (UDP) / Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) through a WiFi module to other devices. A fully automated and accurate measurement system is hence achieved with direct computer interface for logging and analysis of the data. Apple Push Notification has also been incorporated to notify users’ iOS devices of the measurement status. The present work shows that high-throughput label-free electrical detection of protein interactions can be achieved by direct detection of the OCP with suitable multiplexed instrumentation...|$|R
40|$|Aggressive CMOS scaling {{results in}} low {{threshold}} voltage and thin oxide thickness for transistors manufactured in deep submicrometer regime. As a result, reducing the subthreshold and tunneling gate leakage currents {{has become one}} of the most important criteria in the design of VLSI circuits. In this article we will discuss three major leakage current components in a SRAM cell and also discuss different methods based on dual- Vth & dual- Tox and two sleepy stack techniques to reduce the total leakage power dissipation of static random access memories (SRAMs) while maintaining their performance. On the other hand, performance loss occurs simultaneously with leakage saving. To validate the effect of low power techniques the leakage current and Read and write delays of SRAM cells with 45 nm CMOS process has been simulated. II. Conventional 6 T Sram Cell A typical SRAM, consists of several blocks: cell arrays, <b>address</b> decoder, column <b>multiplexers,</b> sense amplifiers, I/O, and a control circuitry. Fig. 1 shows a 6 -transistor (6 T) SRAM cell. The circuit for an individual SRAM memory cell comprises typically four transistors configured as two cross coupled inverters. In this format the circuit has two stable states, and these equate to the logical “ 0 ” and “ 1 ” states. In addition to the four transistors additional two transistors are required to control the access to the memory cell during the read and write operations. This makes a total of six transistors, making what is termed a 6 T memory cell. The bit value stored in the cell is preserved as long as the cell is connected to a supply voltage. [10...|$|R
