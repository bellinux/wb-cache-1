500|$|After leaving Versailles, neither Jourdain nor Moberly {{mentioned}} the incident {{to one another}} until a week later. Moberly wrote a letter about the trip to her sister <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> to {{the afternoon of the}} Versailles incident, she asked Jourdain if she thought the Petit Trianon was haunted. Jourdain told her that she thought it was. Three months later in Oxford, [...] they compared their notes, then decided to write separate accounts of what happened and research the history of the Trianon. In doing so, they found that on 10 August 1792, the Tuileries palace in Paris was besieged, the king's Swiss guards were massacred and the monarchy itself was abolished six weeks later.|$|E
500|$|Anderson {{informed}} the journalist Margot Adler {{that when he}} was nine years old he encountered a small old woman sitting in the centre of a circle containing brass bowls of herbs. He alleged that he instinctively stripped naked and that she then sexually initiated him into a witchcraft tradition, during which he had a vision of a goddess and a horned god. After the vision, he claimed that they sat in the circle and she instructed him in the magical use of the various herbs, after which he was washed in butter, oil, and salt, before putting his clothes on and returning home. The Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White described this as being [...] "difficult to accept as a literal account", but suggested that Anderson may have undergone a significant spiritual experience with an older woman in 1926, which was subsequently [...] "embellished into the later tale" [...] that he told Adler. A woman who knew Anderson, Cornelia Benavidez, later stated that [...] "He says that he became friends with a woman in the circus who was a fire dancer <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> older worked the stands. She somehow joined the circus in South Africa and {{made her way to the}} US. When he first met her she was 60 years old and he was a nine-year-old boy. He knew her for 15 years". Researcher WIlliam Wallworth provided potential supporting evidence for this claim when he noted that a number of the circuses that performed in Oregon during the 1920s and 1930s had Africans in their travelling retinues.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{received}} five {{nominations for}} the 1994 American Music Awards: Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist, Favorite Soul/R Female Artist, Favorite Pop/Rock Album and Favorite Soul/R Album for Janet, and Favorite Soul/R Single for [...] "That's the Way Love Goes". The same year she received two Grammy Award nominations—Best R Vocal Performance, Female and Best R Song for [...] "That's The Way Love Goes"—winning Best R Song. Several critics asserted she was unjustly {{overlooked in the}} Grammy's three major categories: Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Album of the Year. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune stated, [...] "Jackson again was denied a nomination for album of the year, even though 'janet' (Virgin) has remained in the Top 10 since its release last summer and has been critically acclaimed." [...] He adds that [...] "the oversight is doubly vexing, because —in a songwriting and production partnership with Jimmy Jam (aka James Harris III) and Terry Lewis—is not just a multiplatinum pop act but an artist who has reshaped the sound and image of rhythm and blues over the last decade." [...] Kot laid blame to the oversight {{on the fact that}} many believed her to be a producer-dependent artist—an opinion he found to be in error. Similarly, producer Jimmy Jam stated: [...] "It's easy to say that the two albums she did before she met us weren't successful <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> with us she became successful... 'Control' was the first album she actually had input. I think that's just as significant as the fact we (Jam and Lewis) did the record." ...|$|E

2500|$|Best {{suffered}} from alcoholism {{for most of}} his adult life, leading to numerous controversies and, eventually, his death. In 1981, while playing in the United States, Best stole money from the handbag of a woman he did not know in order to fund a drinking session. [...] "We were sitting in a bar on the beach, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> up to go to the toilet I leaned over and took all the money she had in her bag." ...|$|E
2500|$|Participants in {{the case}} {{received}} much media coverage. Fans approached Clark at restaurants and malls, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> a new hairstyle during the trial, the prosecutor received a standing ovation on the courthouse steps; People approved of the change, but advised her to wear [...] "more fitted suits and tailored skirts". While Cochran, Bailey, and Dershowitz were already well known, others like Kaelin became celebrities, and Resnick and Simpson's girlfriend Paula Barbieri appeared in Playboy. Those involved in the trial followed their own media coverage; when Larry King appeared in the courtroom after a meeting with Ito, both Simpson and Clark praised King's talk show. Interest {{in the case}} was worldwide; Russian president Boris Yeltsin's first question to President Clinton when they met in 1995 was [...] "Do you think O. J. did it?".|$|E
2500|$|Case-law {{where this}} test applies {{includes}} McLoughlin v O'Brian [...] AC 410, {{in which the}} husband and children of the claimant {{were involved in a}} car accident that was caused by the negligence of the defendant. The claimant found out about the accident an hour later <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> to the hospital two hours later, one child had already died. She saw her husband and children suffering and suffered shock, depression and a change of personality. The court established a spectrum of proximity; a pedestrian should be able to withstand seeing the accidents that occur in everyday life, but a family member of the victims will inevitably suffer greater emotional harm. Nonetheless, simply seeing the aftermath of the accident and not witnessing it is insufficient proximity. Similarly, seeing a video of the accident is insufficient.|$|E

50|$|Once {{she cast}} the spell, chaos ensued {{as they were}} brought to the Subtle Realms <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> {{admitted}} <b>she</b> <b>got</b> the spell wrong and accidentally released the King of Tears.

When the team returned to their base, Anna joined the team.|$|R

60|$|The lioness plunged {{in after}} her, and swam a little way, but came back again; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was <b>got</b> upon the land {{she set up}} the most hideous roar that ever I heard in my life, as if done in the rage of having lost her prey.|$|R

60|$|Why, of course, in our long-drawn-out Christian day, man {{is given}} and woman is recipient. Man is the gift, woman the receiver. This is the sacrament we live by; the holy Communion we live for. That man gives himself to woman in an utter and sacred abandon, all, all, all himself given, and taken. Woman, eternal woman, {{she is the}} communicant. She {{receives}} the sacramental body and spirit of the man. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> it, according to her passionate and all-too-sacred desire, completely, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> possesses her man at last finally and ultimately, without blemish or reservation in the perfection of the sacrament: then, also, poor woman, the blood and the body of which she has partaken become insipid or nauseous to her, she is driven mad by the endless meal of the marriage sacrament, poisoned by the sacred communion which was her goal and her soul's ambition.|$|R

60|$|Columbine left rather precipitously, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> {{outdoors}} {{it seemed}} that the hills had never been so softly, dreamily gray, nor their loneliness so sweet, nor the sky so richly and deeply blue.

60|$|Before {{she could}} say {{anything}} more an unseen hand seized her firmly and threw {{her out of the}} door, which closed behind her with a sharp slam.
