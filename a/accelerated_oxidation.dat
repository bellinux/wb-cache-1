Like graphite, MoS2 has a hexagonal crystal structure with the intrinsic property of easy shear. MoS2 lubrication performance often exceeds that of graphite and is effective in vacuum as well, whereas graphite is not. The temperature limitation of MoS2 at 400 °C is restricted by oxidation. Particle size and film thickness are important parameters that should be matched to the surface roughness of the substrate.

The effect of temperature and visible light intensity on changes in ground pa-prika colour was investigated.

Investiga-tions were carried out at three lighting intensity levels of D 65 light (6000, 4500, 0 lx) at storage temperature (30 º, 40 º, 50 ºC). The DOE model for investigation planning included in Statistica Pro-gram was used in investigations. The validation investigations were carried out to verify the mo-del. Colour changes in the investigated samples were connected, first of all, with their lighting intensity and less so with storage temperature. A two-stage process of colour changes in the sam-ples illuminated with the light of intensity 6000 lx was found.

40|$|Today {{saturated}} lipids in {{food are}} increasingly replaced by healthier unsaturated lipids. These new lipid-rich food products {{are more susceptible}} to lipid oxidation resulting in the formation of undesired flavors and aromas. Fish oil {{is one of the most}} oxidative instable products due to its high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as DHA and EPA. The development of undesired organoleptic changes in fish oil is often noticeable after a few days or weeks. To study these oxidative lipid mechanisms in a faster manner, <b>accelerated</b> <b>oxidation</b> tests are required. Today most accelerated lipid oxidation tests are based on increasing temperature (e. g. Rancimat approach). However, several studies indicate a poor correlation with natural lipid oxidation mechanisms due to widely divergent kinetics in function of the employed temperature. Recent studies also show that antioxidant properties can be falsely interpreted when applying elevated temperatures. In this study a-tocopherol was added to fish oil. Both standard fish oil, as the enriched matrix, were exposed to different thermal conditions for <b>accelerated</b> <b>oxidation.</b> In this work volatile organic compounds were measured as markers for fish oil oxidation. A natural aging test was set up by storing a sample of fresh fish oil in the dark at ambient temperature. This test was used as a reference to evaluate the above-mentioned <b>accelerated</b> <b>oxidation</b> methods. Additionally, in this study a highly innovative technique, non-thermal plasma technology, was applied on the fish oil matrices. Recently, Van Durme et al. (2014) published that Non-thermal Plasma might have the potential to study lipid oxidation mechanisms in an faster manner at moderate conditions, hence possibly inducing changes closer to natural oxidation mechanisms. Fish oil samples were treated with a radio-frequency plasma jet (0. 3 % O 2 /Argon plasma). First results of this highly innovative technique will be discussed for fish oil, with and without a-tocopherol, and compared with both the discussed thermally-based and natural oxidation tests. status: publishe...|$|E

To evaluate the oxidative stability a wide range of techniques has been described in literature, of which most are thermally based. These unrealistic test conditions result in the induction of deviating oxidation chemistry compared to that observed during ambient storage. Non-thermal plasma technology is capable to generate a wide range of highly reactive oxidative species (e. g. atomic oxygen, hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygen) while maintaining ambient temperatures. For the first time, a DBD-plasma jet (Ar/ 0. 6 % O 2) is used on fish oil samples as a faster and more realistic accelerated lipid oxidation method. This paper critically evaluates both a thermal as a non-thermal plasma based <b>accelerated</b> <b>oxidation</b> protocol using naturally aged fish oil as reference. Experiments were done using both virgin, as alpha-tocopherol-enriched fish oil samples. Secondary lipid oxidation volatiles were measured using HS-SPME-GC-MS. Both <b>accelerated</b> <b>oxidation</b> techniques induced the formation of typical lipid oxidation markers (e. g. 2 -propenal, (E) - 2 -pentenal, heptanal), however in both cases significant differences were observed compared to the naturally aged fish oil. On the other side, nonthermal plasma correctly predicted an antioxidative effect when 1000 μg/g alpha-tocopherol was added to the fish oil, while thermally based tests resulted in the induction of prooxidative chemistry.
