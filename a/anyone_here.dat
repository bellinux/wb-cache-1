25|$|The {{matter is}} {{altogether}} different with Scott the novelist. The poems were read {{because they were}} fashionable. But {{the popularity of the}} novels was such that fanatically devoted readers fiercely debated the respective merits of their favourite characters and scenes. Hazlitt, whose reviews had been highly favourable and appreciated these books as much as <b>anyone,</b> <b>here</b> elaborates on his own favourites, after first discussing a qualifying issue.|$|E
25|$|Like Smile by The Beach Boys, Third (or Has <b>Anyone</b> <b>Here</b> Seen Siegfried?) by Pavlov's Dog, and Chinese Democracy by Guns n' Roses, Stone of Sisyphus {{acquired}} a legend of its own. Tracks from the unreleased album surfaced on bootleg recordings which were distributed via tape and the Internet, {{while many of}} the songs appeared on albums from the various constituent artists, and from Chicago's own legitimate compilations.|$|E

2500|$|From March 1960 {{until about}} 1967 (some sources give 1968), Tracey was the house pianist at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in Soho, London, {{and he had}} the {{opportunity}} to accompany many of the leading musicians from the US who visited the club. Recordings of some of these performances appeared on LP and others have appeared in recent years on the Jazz House and Harkit labels, recorded by the journalist Les Tomkins, but with non-professional sound quality. In this context he gained some high-profile admirers; Sonny Rollins asserted at one concert: [...] "Does <b>anyone</b> <b>here</b> know how good he is?". It is Tracey on piano that film viewers hear behind Rollins on the soundtrack of the Michael Caine version of Alfie (1966).|$|E
2500|$|During the 1950s the public's musical {{preferences}} shifted toward toward {{rhythm and}} blues and rock and roll, ending the careers of most older artists. Carmichael's songwriting career also slowed down, but he continued to perform. He appeared in the motion picture Young Man with a Horn (1950), based on friend Bix Beiderbecke's life, with Bacall and Kirk Douglas. [...] "In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening", with lyrics by Johnny Mercer, was featured in the 1951 film Here Comes the Groom and won Carmichael his first Academy Award for Best Original Song, and Mercer his second of four Academy Awards. In 1952 Carmichael played his composition [...] "My Resistance Is Low" [...] in the Howard Hughes film The Las Vegas Story. The lyrics were written by Harold Adamson. Although the song did not catch fire in the United States, it was a hit in Great Britain. Carmichael also composed seven songs for Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), but only two made the final cut: [...] "Ain't There <b>Anyone</b> <b>Here</b> for Love", sung by Jane Russell, and [...] "When Love Goes Wrong (Nothing Goes Right)". Harold Campbell Adamson wrote the lyrics or both songs.|$|E
2500|$|In Long Kesh in the mid-1970s, writing {{under the}} {{pseudonym}} [...] "Brownie" [...] in Republican News, Adams called for increased political activity among republicans, especially at local level. The call resonated with younger Northern people, {{many of whom}} had been active in the Provisional IRA but few of whom had been active in Sinn Féin. In 1977, Adams and Danny Morrison drafted the address of Jimmy Drumm at the annual Wolfe Tone commemoration at Bodenstown. The address was viewed as watershed in that Drumm acknowledged that the war would be a long one and that success depended on political activity that would complement the IRA's armed campaign. For some, this wedding of politics and armed struggle culminated in Danny Morrison's statement at the 1981 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in which he asked [...] "Who here really believes we can win the war through the ballot box? But will <b>anyone</b> <b>here</b> object if, with a ballot paper in one hand and the Armalite in the other, we take power in Ireland?" [...] For others, however, the call to link political activity with armed struggle had already been defined in Sinn Féin policy and in the presidential addresses of Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, but this had not resonated with young Northerners.|$|E

2500|$|Leung's father saw an {{advertisement}} for a Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire casting call, and suggested she should try out. She waited four hours {{in line for a}} five-minute audition, despite feeling she had little likelihood of obtaining the role, Two weeks later, she was called back for a workshop and was cast as Cho Chang, beating out over 3,000 other girls for the part. In retrospect, she stated {{in an interview with the}} Daily Record that her Scottish accent probably gave her an advantage in the casting, as the casting director asked the girls who attended the audition, [...] "Is there <b>anyone</b> <b>here</b> from Scotland?", to which only Leung raised her hand. In a 2011 interview, Leung said her fondest memory of the Harry Potter experience was the first audition, because both her parents, who were separated at the time, went with her. [...] "It was a really nice moment because my parents hadn't seen each other for a long, long time," [...] Leung said. In an effort to heavily promote Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Warner Bros. sent Leung to China in the film's second week of release, which was unusual for a market not used to frequent celebrity visits.|$|E

60|$|LADY CICELY (apparently deeply impressed). I {{wonder whether}} he can be, Mr. Rankin. If you think so, that's heavily against him in my opinion, because you have more {{knowledge}} of men than <b>anyone</b> else <b>here.</b> Perhaps I'm mistaken.

6000|$|... "Not they, yer honour. They {{all think}} it's {{just as you}} say; that the village was burned, and {{we have come to}} look for work in the city. Besides, if it was <b>anyone</b> <b>here,</b> he wouldn't have to take the trouble to track us back." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{fight for}} pole turned to be a no-contest with Michael Schumacher convincingly faster than <b>anyone</b> else <b>here</b> {{including}} his team-mate.

6000|$|Edward {{laughed again}} as he looked round at the gleaming eyes, the waving arms and the flushed joyful faces of his liegemen. [...] "Who hath fought against these Spaniards?" [...] he asked. [...] "Is there <b>anyone</b> <b>here</b> who can tell us what manner of men they be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{it would}} amuse you," [...] he said, [...] "and I can find <b>anyone</b> <b>here</b> to help me, I daresay we could manage some thought transference.
