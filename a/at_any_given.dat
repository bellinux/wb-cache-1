5|$|The {{climate of}} a region depends {{on a number of}} factors, {{especially}} latitude. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the tropical climate at the equator to the polar climate in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the Earth's axis being tilted relative to its orbital plane. Thus, <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>given</b> time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the sun. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. <b>At</b> <b>any</b> <b>given</b> time, regardless of season, the northern and southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons.|$|E

5|$|Assuming {{genetic drift}} {{is the only}} {{evolutionary}} force acting on an allele, <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>given</b> time the probability that an allele will eventually become fixed in the population is simply its frequency in the population at that time.

5|$|Because <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>given</b> {{point on}} Earth {{the weight of}} an object is {{proportional}} to its mass, the mass of an object in kilograms is usually measured by comparing its weight to {{the weight of a}} standard mass, whose mass is known in kilograms, using a device called a weighing scale. The ratio of the force of gravity on the two objects, measured by the scale, is equal to the ratio of their masses.|$|E
5|$|Because of its rarity, it {{is among}} the most {{expensive}} elements. Price for pure scandium fluctuates between 4 000 and 20 000 US dollars per kilogram.

In 2010, {{at the peak of the}} rare-earths shortage, the price of scandium rose to over 15,000 US dollars per kilogram, and the widely commercially used scandium oxide (Sc2O3) was selling above 7 000 US dollars per kilogram.

50|$|Air pressure, technically, is a {{measurement}} {{of the amount of}} collisions against a surface <b>at</b> <b>any</b> time. In the case of balloon, it's supposed to measure how many particles <b>at</b> <b>any</b> in <b>any</b> <b>given</b> time space collide with the wall of the balloon and bounce off. However, since this is near impossible to measure, air pressure seems to be easier described as density. The similarity comes from the idea that when there are more molecules in the same space, more of them will be heading towards a collision course with the wall.|$|R
