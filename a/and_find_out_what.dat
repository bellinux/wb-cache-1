5|$|Johnson began {{thinking}} of life after basketball while still {{playing with the}} Lakers. He wondered why so many athletes had failed at business, and sought advice. During his seventh season in the NBA, he {{had a meeting with}} Michael Ovitz, CEO of Creative Artists Agency. Ovitz encouraged him to start reading business magazines and to use every connection available to him. Johnson learned everything he could about business, often meeting with corporate executives during road trips. Johnson's first foray into business, a high-end sporting goods store named Magic 32, failed after only one year, costing him $200,000. The experience taught him to listen to his customers <b>and</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> products they wanted. Johnson has become a leading voice on how to invest in urban communities, creating redevelopment opportunities in underserved areas, most notably through his movie theaters and his partnership with Starbucks. He went to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz with the idea that he could successfully open the coffee shops in urban areas. After showing Schultz the tremendous buying power of minorities, Johnson was able to purchase 125 Starbucks stores, which reported higher than average per capita sales. The partnership, called Urban Coffee Opportunities, placed Starbucks in locations such as Detroit, Washington, D.C., Harlem, and the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles. Johnson sold his remaining interest in the stores back to the company in 2010, ending a successful twelve-year partnership. Johnson has also invested in urban California real estate and financial service companies catering to America's underserved markets via his Canyon-Johnson and Yucaipa-Johnson funds. Another major project is with Chicago-based Aon Corp., an insurance services company is designed to promote minority businesses. In 2006-07, Johnson was part of a syndicate that bought the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, then the tallest building in Brooklyn, for $71 million and converted the 512-foot high landmark structure from an office building into luxury condominiums.|$|E

It starts out with the appearance of a smoke monster that kills its victims by enveloping them and leaving behind an exact life-like looking corpse only the body is made of ash which crumbles horribly when touched. The smoke creature moved rapidly as opposed to gently drifting so I had some movement to play off of in creating a sound for him. I came up with some stuttering, fluttery whooshes that kind of vibrated which made him more dangerous than if he sounded like a puff of steam moving along the hall. The smoke monster requires a host body to live in when he's not vibrating around killing people. The only way to recall the smoke monster to the host body, or to keep him there in the first place, is by severe electrical shock." ...|$|E

500|$|Feeling {{like her}} {{character}} was wasting her college degree O'Toole suggested to the producers that Martha {{go to work}} for Lex during the second season.

Disappointed when the storyline ended quickly into the second season, O'Toole hoped that the secret her character was holding in [...] "Ryan" [...] was that Martha was going to run for Mayor. In O'Toole's opinion, Martha needs some form of outlet for intelligence. To the chagrin of O'Toole, Martha's next storyline—the expectation of a new child—tied the character to the farm in a way the actress did not agree with. O'Toole wanted to perform as if the pregnancy was fake—something mentally created by Clark's ship—but the producers insisted that she wear the pregnancy pads to indicate that she was indeed pregnant. Ultimately, that storyline ended with Martha losing the baby to a miscarriage. Before season four began, O'Toole suggested again to the producers that Martha {{go to work for}} Lex. O'Toole had enjoyed the moments in the show when she was working for Lionel, because it gave her character something more to do, and she wanted to do that again for season four. The producers took her suggestion and had Martha take a job at the Talon, which was owned by Lex, and which O'Toole felt allowed Martha to interact more with the other characters in Clark's life.|$|E
