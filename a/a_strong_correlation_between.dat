5|$|Linezolid is metabolized in the liver, by {{oxidation}} of the morpholine ring, without {{involvement of}} the cytochrome P450 system. This metabolic pathway leads to two major inactive metabolites (which each account for around 45% and 10% of an excreted dose at steady state), one minor metabolite, and several trace metabolites, none of which {{accounts for more than}} 1% of an excreted dose. Clearance of linezolid varies with age and gender; it is fastest in children (which accounts for the shorter half-life), and appears to be 20% lower in women than in men. There is <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> linezolid clearance and creatinine clearance (CLCR).|$|E

40|$|Hair is {{evaluated}} and compared with urine as a biomonitor for human intake of uranium. Concentrations of U and U and the activity ratio between them are {{measured in the}} hair, urine, and drinking water of 24 drilled bedrock well water users in Östergötland, Sweden. The samples are measured with α-spectrometry after radiochemical preparation using liquid-liquid separation with tributylphosphate. The results {{show that there is}} <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> the uranium concentrations in the drinking water of each subject and the hair of the subject (r = 0. 50) than with the urine (r = 0. 21). There is also <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> the activity ratios of water and hair (r = 0. 91) than between water and urine (r = 0. 56). These results imply that hair may serve as a robust indicator of chronic uranium intake. One obvious advantage over sampling urine is that hair samples reflect a much longer excretion period: weeks compared to days. The absorbed fraction of uranium, the f value, is calculated as the ratio between the excreted amount of uranium in urine and hair per day and the daily drinking water intake of uranium. The f values stretch from 0. 002 to 0. 10 with a median of 0. 023...|$|R

25|$|Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory {{is another}} {{cognitive}} process theory that offers the important concept of self-efficacy for explaining employee's level of motivation relative to workplace tasks or goals. Self-efficacy is an individual's belief {{in his or}} her ability to achieve results in a given scenario.

In some cases the rouge test {{has been shown to}} have differing results, depending on sociocultural orientation. For example, a Cameroonian Nso sample of infants 18 to 20 months of age had an extremely low amount of self-recognition outcomes at 3.2%. The study also found two strong predictors of self-recognition: object stimulation (maternal effort of attracting the attention of the infant to an object either person touched) and mutual eye contact. <b>A</b> <b>strong</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> self-concept and object permanence have also been demonstrated using the rouge test.|$|E

The incidence of poverty is much higher among scheduled castes (SC) and scheduled tribes (ST) households in Pilibhit.

25|$|Employment {{conditions}} abroad {{are relevant}} to the individual worker and their families {{as well as for the}} sending country and its economic growth and well being. Poor working conditions for Filipinos hired abroad include long hours, low wages and few chances to visit family. Women often face disadvantages in their employment conditions as they tend to work in the elder/child care and domestic. These occupations are considered low skilled and require little education and training, thereby regularly facing poor working conditions. Women facing just working conditions are more likely to provide their children with adequate nutrition, better education and sufficient health.

30|$|Second, {{using the}} phase angle {{previously}} mentioned, we examine {{whether or not}} seismic events occur indiscriminately within the half daily tidal periodic variation by applying Schuster’s test (Schuster, 1897; Heaton, 1982; Tsuruoka et al., 1995; Wilcock, 2001; Tanaka et al., 2002 a). Schuster’s test introduced a parameter p, whose value represents {{the probability of a}} random earthquake phase distribution.

Many individuals with BPD report a history of abuse and neglect as young children, but causation is still debated. Patients with BPD {{have been found to}} be significantly more likely to report having been verbally, emotionally, physically, or sexually abused by caregivers of either gender. They also report a high incidence of incest and loss of caregivers in early childhood. Individuals with BPD were also likely to report having caregivers of both sexes deny the validity of their thoughts and feelings. Caregivers were also reported to have failed to provide needed protection and to have neglected their child's physical care. Parents of both sexes were typically reported to have withdrawn from the child emotionally and to have treated the child inconsistently. Additionally, women with BPD who reported a previous history of neglect by a female caregiver and abuse by a male caregiver were significantly more likely to experience sexual abuse by a non-caregiver.|$|E
