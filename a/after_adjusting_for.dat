40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous studies {{indicated}} that apolipoprotein measurements predicted cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; however, associations between apolipoproteins and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) were less explored. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The cross-sectional study included 6069 participants aged 40 {{years or older}} with NGT from Shanghai, China. Serum fasting traditional lipids (total cholesterol [TC], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C] and triglycerides [TG]), apoA-I and apoB were assessed. A high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography was performed to measure CIMT. We found CIMT increased progressively across the quartiles of serum apoB (p for trend < 0. 0001). In logistic regression, concentrations of apoB (odds ratio [OR] 1. 27, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 18 - 1. 36), TC (OR 1. 23, 95 % CI 1. 14 - 1. 32), LDL-C (OR 1. 25, 95 % CI 1. 16 - 1. 34) and TG (OR 1. 11, 95 % CI 1. 04 - 1. 20) {{were significantly related to}} elevated CIMT <b>after</b> <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> age and sex.

40|$|Background: Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus {{is one of}} the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide, currently affecting about 3 million global populations. The incidence of Type 2 diabetes has been increasing particularly in recently developed Asian settings including Hong Kong. Dairy product, as a part of dietary guidelines, has been hypothesized to help reduce risks of Type 2 diabetes. However different types of dairy product might have different effects on Type 2 diabetes given their varying content in fat, sugar and vitamins. Objective: To review literature on the examination of the association between consumption of different types of dairy products (total dairy, high-fat dairy, low-fat dairy and fermented dairy) and the risk of type 2 diabetes Methods Relevant studies were searched and identified through database of PubMed and Google Scholar using combination of keywords. Studies examining the association between consumption of total dairy and subtypes of dairy products and the risk of type 2 diabetes were included. Results: Of the 163 papers identified, 10 studies were finally included in this systematic review. All studies were prospective cohort study from Western countries. Findings for different kinds of dairy products varied. For high-fat dairy products consumption, nine out of the ten studies found there was no association with type 2 diabetes risks. For low-fat dairy products, six out of ten studies found an inverse association <b>after</b> <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> confounders like age, sex and total energy intake; among these six studies, three still reported an inverse association <b>after</b> further <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> confounders like education level, smoking status and alcohol intake, physical activities and family history of type 2 diabetes. For fermented dairy products (mainly yoghurt), among seven studies which examined this, three studies found an inverse association between yogurt consumption and Type 2 diabetes risk before and <b>after</b> <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> multivariate confounders (age,sex, total energy drink, education level, social class, physical activities, smoking status, alcohol intake and family history of type 2 diabetes, etc). One of the three studies also found that, other than yogurt, there was an inverse association between low-fat fermented dairy and total fermented dairy consumption and type 2 diabetes risks <b>after</b> <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> age and sex. However, after further adjustment, the association became null for total fermented dairy products while it remained for low-fat fermented dairy products. All of the 10 studies that examined subtypes of dairy product also reported total dairy product consumption. For total dairy product, six out of ten studies found an inverse association. Conclusion: Overall, total dairy consumption might be associated with lower risks of type 2 diabetes, but the associations may be varied by subtypes of dairy products. Across different types of dairy products, low-fat dairy consumption was associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes while high-fat dairy consumption was clearly not associated with type 2 diabetes risk. Results for subtypes of fermented dairy consumption remain unclear.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN. Retrospective multicenter study. OBJECTIVE. To compare {{clinical}} outcomes and surgical-related adverse events {{in patients with}} multilevel cervical myelopathy (MCM) undergoing simple anterior, simple posterior, or 1 -stage posterior-anterior surgical decompression strategies. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Simple anterior, simple posterior, and 1 -stage posterior-anterior surgical decompression strategies have been advocated for MCM treatment in both Western and Chinese populations. However, there is limited evidence on whether 1 -stage posterior-anterior strategy may offer equal or more advantages than the other 2 strategies for patients with MCM. METHODS. A retrospective review of medical records was conducted for 255 patients with MCM who had undergone surgical decompression in 3 Chinese spinal centers from 1999 to 2010. Neurological status, perioperative variables, and surgical complications were assessed. Multiple linear regression {{was used to evaluate}} factors associated with the outcomes of each strategy. RESULTS. Analyses were conducted on a total of 229 patients with MCM undergoing surgical decompression via 1 -stage posterior-anterior (68 patients), simple anterior (102 patients), and simple posterior approaches (59 patients). One-stage posterior-anterior approach had the highest Japanese Orthopaedic Association recovery rate <b>after</b> <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> age and sex (adjusted mean ± SD: 50. 0 ± 3. 2, P < 0. 001) and additionally <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> smoking, duration from onset of symptoms to surgery, comorbidities, preoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, Ishihara's curvature index and Pavlov ratio, operative blood loss, operating time, anterior operated disc levels, and posterior operated levels (adjusted mean ± SD: 51. 6 ± 11. 6, P < 0. 01). Anterior approach had the largest difference between the pre-and postoperative Ishihara's curvature indexes <b>after</b> <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> age and sex (adjusted mean ± SD: 5. 3 ± 1. 0, P < 0. 01) and <b>after</b> multivariable adjustment (<b>adjusted</b> mean ± SD: 6. 5 ± 2. 8, P = 0. 003). CONCLUSION. One-stage posterior-anterior strategy can be a reliable and effective treatment strategy for MCM in a subgroup of patients with anterior and posterior compression on spinal cord simultaneously. © 2012, Lippincott Williams &Wilkins. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

METHODS: Plasma A-FABP and APN in 133 patients with newly diagnosed T 2 DM were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. FA-IMT, endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilation of brachial artery was measured by high-resolution vascular ultrasound. Upper quartile of FA-IMT {{was regarded as a}} criterion of elevated FA-IMT, defined as early atherosclerosis (AS). The patients were subdivided into low FA-IMT group (FA-IMT /= 0. 80 mm, n = 33). RESULTS: Plasma A-FABP/APN ratio was higher in early AS group than in low IMT control group [A-FABP/APN x 1000, 3. 9 (2. 8 approximately 6. 1) vs 2. 9 (1. 8 approximately 5. 7), P < 0. 05]. FA-IMT correlated positively with plasma A-FABP/APN ratio (r = 0. 216, P = 0. 006) and negatively with APN (r = - 0. 179, P = 0. 020). <b>After</b> <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> age, gender and BMI, FA-IMT still correlated positively with plasma A-FABP/APN ratio (r = 0. 217, P = 0. 007) and negatively with APN (r = - 0. 172, P = 0. 026). Endothelium-dependent vasodilation correlated negatively with plasma A-FABP/APN ratio (r = - 0. 166, P = 0. 028). <b>After</b> <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> age, gender and BMI, endothelium-dependent vasodilation still correlated negatively with plasma A-FABP/APN ratio (r = - 0. 153, P = 0. 042). CONCLUSION: Plasma A-FABP/APN ratio is closely associated with FA-IMT and endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Plasma A-FABP/APN ratio may be a better clinical marker of AS and endothelial dysfunction than A-FABP or APN alone in patients with newly diagnosed T 2 DM. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Methods We selected 2752 participants from the baseline survey of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) 2011 – 2012 to evaluate the associations of early life the Chinese famine exposure with risk of dyslipidemia in adulthood. Dyslipidemia was defined as TC (Total Cholesterol) : HDL-C (High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol) ratio ≥  5. 0 or use cholesterol lowering drugs. Famine exposure cohorts were categorized by birthdates of participants. Binary logistics regression model {{was used to examine}} the associations of early-life famine exposure with the risk of dyslipidemia. Results The dyslipidemia prevalence of the non-exposed cohort, fetal stage-, infant stage-, and preschool stage-exposed cohorts in adulthood was 15. 7 %, 23. 1 %, 22. 0 %, and 18. 6 %, respectively. Early-life exposure to the Chinese famine significantly increased LDL cholesterol concentrations in adulthood <b>after</b> <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> age. The risks of dyslipidemia in fetal (OR =  1. 58; 95 % CI: 1. 23 – 2. 03; P <  0. 001) and infant (OR =  1. 52; 95 % CI: 1. 15 – 2. 00; P =  0. 003) stage-exposed cohorts were significantly higher than the non-exposed cohort <b>after</b> <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> gender and current family economic status. Following gender stratification, we found that fetal (OR =  1. 80; 95 % CI: 1. 26 – 2. 57; P =  0. 001), infant (OR =  1. 75; 95 % CI: 1. 17 – 2. 62; P =  0. 006), and preschool (OR =  1. 63; 95 % CI: 1. 10 – 2. 42; P =  0. 015) -stage exposure to severe famine aggravated the risk of dyslipidemia in female adults. However, the similar association was not observed for male adults. Conclusions Early-life exposure to severe Chinese famine could link with the higher dyslipidemia risk in female adulthood, but not in male adulthood. This gender-specific effect might be associated with the hypothesis that parents in China prefer boys to girls traditionally or survivors’ bias...|$|R

2500|$|Metronidazole {{is listed}} by the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) as {{reasonably}} anticipated to {{be a human}} carcinogen. Although some of the testing methods have been questioned, oral exposure has been shown to cause cancer in experimental animals and has also demonstrated some mutagenic effects in bacterial cultures. The relationship between exposure to metronidazole and human cancer is unclear. One study [...] found an excess in lung cancer among women (even <b>after</b> <b>adjusting</b> <b>for</b> smoking), while other studies [...] found either no increased risk, or a statistically insignificant risk.|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a nationwide survey {{to evaluate the}} effect of implementing a smoke-free policy in municipalities that forbid teachers to smoke on school premises. Questionnaires were mailed to 3207 municipalities throughout Japan. <b>After</b> we <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> population size and the standardized mortality ratio for male lung cancer, we found that assigning a high priority to tobacco control in municipal health promotion activities {{was significantly associated with}} implementation of school tobacco-control policies (odds ratio = 1. 50, 95 % confidence interval= 1. 24, 1. 81) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Nonalcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) is {{associated}} with the increased burden of kidney. However, there is still no large population study to explore the potential relationship between NAFLD and mild kidney function damage (MKFD) <b>after</b> <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> confounding factors. This study is to test the hypothesis that NAFLD {{is associated with}} MKFD under controlling the effects of confoun-ding factors. Materials and methods: Levels of serum fasting glucose, creatinine, cholesterol, triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were analyzed from 1412 Chinese Han adults. Questionnaire and physical examination were performed to explore the potential association of NAFLD with kidney function. Results: NAFLD was associated with impairment of kidney function. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratio illustrated that, compared to subjects with normal liver, NAFLD subjects had a significantly higher risk of MKFD with or without <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> blood glucose and other covariates (P = 0. 041). Further results from multi-interaction analysis demonstrated that the underlying mechanisms linked NAFLD with im-paired kidney function may be that they share common risk factors and similar pathological proces-ses. Conclusions: The most striking finding {{of this study is that}} NAFLD is negatively associated with kidney function, in nondiabetic population. NAFLD and MKFD may share similar risk factors and/or pathological processes...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Objectives: {{to present}} {{currently}} available evidence {{to verify the}} association between metabolic syndrome and quality of life. Method: Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Medline and LILACS databases were studied for all studies investigating the association with metabolic syndrome and quality of life. Two blinded reviewers extracted data and one more was chosen in case of doubt. Results: a total of 30 studies were included, considering inclusion and exclusion criteria, which involved 62. 063 patients. Almost all studies suggested that metabolic syndrome is significantly associated with impaired quality of life. Some, however, found association only in women, or only if associated with depression or Body Mass Index. Merely one study did not find association <b>after</b> <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> confounding factors. Conclusion: although {{there are a few}} studies available about the relationship between metabolic syndrome and quality of life, a growing body of evidence has shown significant association between metabolic syndrome and the worsening of quality of life. However, it is necessary to carry out further longitudinal studies to confirm this association and verify whether this relationship is linear, or only an association factor...|$|R
