500|$|Producer and screenwriter David L. Paterson is the novel's author's son, and {{his name}} was {{featured}} on its dedication page. The story was based on his real life best friend, Lisa Hill, who was struck by lightning and killed {{when they were both}} eight years old. Paterson had asked his mother, Katherine Paterson, if he could write a screenplay of the novel, and she agreed [...] "not only because he's [...] son, but also because he's a very good playwright". Paterson had difficulty marketing the screenplay, mostly because of Leslie's death; [...] "if you can believe this, I did meet with some companies that <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> just 'hurt' Leslie a little bit—put her in a light coma and then bring her out".|$|E
2500|$|Tommy Lee Wallace, the film's art director, spoke admirably about Carpenter during post. [...] " [...] <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> cut sound effects. The answer, {{of course}} was 'Sure!' Once again, here I was, a {{perfectly}} green recruit, yet John made {{a leap of faith}} … he further insisted we get the best processing money could, which at that time was the legendary MGM color labs. Finally, he insisted we get the best postproduction sound money could buy, which was Samuel Goldwin Sound, another legend. The expense for this unorthodox approach ate up a huge amount of the budget. The production manager fumed that we were exploiting people to pay for processing— and it was true." ...|$|E
60|$|I bade her good-day, and, after a {{few words}} of inquiry as to her health, <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be of any service to her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Since then, sir, {{something}} has happened that makes me wish they had found me, and I have come to-night to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> enter on board your ship the Victory.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Not Seek Compliance: No {{attempt is}} made to get others {{to do what you}} want. That is, no {{compliance}} is sought. Example: [...] "I didn't <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go out tonight." ...|$|R
60|$|Walking {{along the}} Strand one evening last year towards Pall Mall, I was accosted near Charing Cross Station by a strange-looking, middle-aged {{man in a}} poor suit of clothes, who {{surprised}} and startled me by <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell him from what inn the coach usually started for York.|$|R
6000|$|... "I heard a new mill {{had started}} at Royal {{and walked up}} there to inquire for work. The manager <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> keep books, and I said yes." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{evening after}} dinner Tom came in alone, and I {{suspected}} that Perry had sent him. He was fidgety, ill at ease, and presently <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see {{him a moment}} in my study. Maude's glance followed us.|$|E
60|$|The {{door was}} opened by a melancholy middle-aged woman servant. I gave her my card, and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see Mrs. Catherick. The card {{was taken into}} the front parlour, and the servant {{returned}} with a message requesting me to mention what my business was.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{started singing}} country music and {{learning}} old country {{songs on the}} guitar when I was 12. I was really, really shy but just had this desire to get on stage and started calling clubs myself to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> come down and sing", says Nash, {{who grew up in}} the Texas Hill Country town of New Braunfels.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He's as cross as a {{bear with}} a sore head. He's a deal older than I am, and a cousin and all that, but I'm {{not going to put}} up with insolence. If it were {{anywhere}} else I should just go into the yard and <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have a horse and saddle as a matter of course.' ...|$|R
40|$|Recently a {{colleague}} wanted {{to include a}} section on perfect hashing functions in the latest edition of a book [4], and after an on-line search brought up a reference of mine [8], he sent me an email <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> generate a minimal perfect hashing function (MPHF) for the set of reserved words in Ada 2005. This is {{a summary of the}} process that determined one...|$|R
60|$|The {{conversation}} languished a little, and {{we picked}} some flowers for the house. Then she <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> run. I conceded her various starts and we raced {{up and down}} the middle garden path. Then, a little breathless, we went into the new twenty-five guinea summer-house {{at the end of the}} herbaceous border.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the same}} man," [...] she {{answered}} confidently. [...] "He stopped me and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> direct him to your house. It was {{about half an hour}} after you had gone. He spoke very softly and almost like a foreigner. I told him exactly where your cottage was. Didn't he come to you?" ...|$|E
60|$|This {{information}} was communicated {{to me by}} Joseph, on my return from an early visit {{to one of our}} warehouses at the riverside. When I <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see my aunt, I was informed that she had already retired to rest in her room, after the fatigue of a seven hours' journey by night.|$|E
60|$|A day or {{two later}} Mrs. Strickland sent me round a note <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go and see her that evening after dinner. I found her alone. Her black dress, simple to austerity, {{suggested}} her bereaved condition, and I was innocently astonished that notwithstanding a real emotion {{she was able to}} dress the part she had to play according to her notions of seemliness.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{believe she}} <b>could</b> not stand two months at Clarkman's, thought Bertha. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> {{were not going}} to Aunt Meg's, I would ask her to go home with me. Or even if Aunt Meg had room for another guest, I'd just write her all about Grace and <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bring her with me. Aunt Meg would understand--she always understands. But she hasn't, so it can't be.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Perch {{came to me}} with a {{face like}} a {{squeezed}} lemon, and <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> lend her five nails.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes! After taking from me {{the last}} farthing I possessed of my own, {{and the last}} farthing I could extort for him from my old mistress, he turned on me as we stood by {{the margin of the}} sea, and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{reconcile}} it to my conscience to let him be wearing such a coat as he then had on his back, and earning his miserable living as a chorus-singer at the opera! ...|$|E
60|$|I have {{no doubt}} that he was right, and that I was prejudiced; but as I saw the first oily, vinegary, garlicky morsel slide noiselessly into his mouth, I began to feel rather sick. My hands were dirty with moving the books, and I <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> wash them before {{beginning}} to work at the likeness, as a good excuse for getting out of the room, while Professor Tizzi was unctuously disposing of his simple vegetable meal.|$|E
60|$|Presently a maid-servant {{came into}} the hall. She was not one I had noticed before. I <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see Mrs. Chester, {{and she said she}} would go and look for her. There were chairs in the hall, and I might have waited for her there, but I did not. I entered the parlor, and was pleased to find it unoccupied. I went to {{the upper end of the}} room, as far as {{possible}} from the door.|$|E
500|$|The Shadows (consisting of {{band members}} Brian Bennett, Hank Marvin, John Rostill and Bruce Welch) as Themselves, {{complementing}} Cliff Richard Jr in Alan Tracy's dream sequence set at The Swinging Star. Bennett remembers the puppet {{that was based}} on his likeness: [...] "The first thing I did was to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> keep him when filming was finished, but apparently he was to be turned into another character after the film had been finished." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> write {{home for}} him or do {{anything}} else. That seemed to touch him. Some day I shall {{tell you what he}} said.|$|R
5000|$|On 22 February 1989 Dodds {{was given}} a {{certificate}} for his two-and-a-half-minute hat-trick against Tranmere Rovers in 1942, which had for many years been listed in the Guinness Book of Records. [...] "I have been listed in the Guinness Book of Records for years but I never thought about a certificate until I read about a woman receiving one for being the oldest golfer to hit a hole in one. A friend wrote to the GBR <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have a certificate and they sent one to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A gentleman {{with very}} {{long hair and}} an aquiline nose, dark, strange, and handsome, called in at my {{department}} and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell him the name of Sir Charles Vandrift's London banker. He {{said he had a}} sum to pay in to your credit, and asked if we would forward it for him. I told him it was irregular for us to receive the money, as you had no account with us, but that your London bankers were Darby, Drummond, and Rothenberg, Limited." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have nothing}} to conceal, my liege," [...] she said, [...] "and my answer shall be as plain and direct as the {{question}} you have <b>asked.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have been moved to an act of ignominious, insane, and ungrateful folly, it could only arise from my being blinded by that passion, which I believe is pleaded {{as an excuse for}} folly and for crime much more often than it has a real existence. I must, in short, have been in love, as it is called--and that might have been--with my equal, but surely never with my sovereign, whether such only in title, or in possession of his kingdom." ...|$|E
60|$|Now I {{looked at}} Goza and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see this messenger. He replied, No, {{as he had}} already been {{despatched}} upon another errand. Then I asked him if the messenger had said anything else. He answered, Yes, one thing that he had forgotten, namely that the writing about blankets should now be in Natal. Then suddenly he changed the subject and asked me if I would like to accompany him to the Valley of Bones where he was ordered to inspect the huts which were being built for Zikali and his people. Of course I said I should, hoping, quite without result, that I might get something more out of him on the road.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is no mistake,' Mrs. Ferrari rejoined, in {{her most}} {{positive}} manner. 'Two gentlemen from the insurance offices called on me this morning, to see the letter. They were completely puzzled--especially when they heard of the bank-note inside. But they know who sent the letter. His lordship's doctor in Venice posted it at his lordship's request. Go to the gentlemen yourself, sir, if you don't believe me. They were polite enough to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> account for Lord Montbarry's writing to me and sending me the money. I gave them my opinion directly--I said it was like his lordship's kindness.' ...|$|R
60|$|MURRAY. You bet I do. I'm {{bound to}} go now. It's ridiculous keeping me here when I'm {{as healthy as}} a pig. I caught Stanton in the hall last night and <b>asked</b> him <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go.|$|R
60|$|In {{a little}} while {{we came to the}} two milk trees by the main gate of the kraal, where much of our {{saddlery}} still lay scattered about, though the guns had gone. Here Kambula <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> recognise my own saddle.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was anxious}} {{to know how they}} bored these long barrels, which seemed {{perfectly}} true and are said to shoot admirably; and, on asking the Gusti, received the enigmatical answer: [...] "We use a basket full of stones." [...] Being utterly unable to imagine what he could mean, I <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see how they did it, and one of the dozen little boys around us was sent to fetch the basket. He soon returned with this most extraordinary boring-machine, the mode of using which the Gusti then explained to me. It was simply a strong bamboo basket, through the bottom of which was stuck upright a pole about three feet long, kept in its place by a few sticks tied across the top with rattans.|$|E
60|$|I am {{not sure}} that Ethelbertha is going to like Mrs. St. Leonard; and I don't think Mrs. St. Leonard will much like Ethelbertha. I have {{gathered}} that Mrs. St. Leonard doesn't like anybody much--except, of course, when it is her duty. She {{does not seem to have}} the time. Man is born to trouble, and it is not bad philosophy to get oneself accustomed to the feeling. But Mrs. St. Leonard has given herself up to the pursuit of trouble to the exclusion of all other interests in life. She appears to regard it as the only calling worthy a Christian woman. I found her alone one afternoon. Her manner was preoccupied; I <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be of any assistance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{not long}} been {{occupied}} with M. Renan," [...] said the bishop, thus adjured, [...] "when I {{became aware of}} the presence of another person in the room. I think my eyes had strayed from the volume, as I turned a page, to the table, on which I perceived the brown strong hand of a young man. Looking up, I beheld my friend the priest, who was indeed a man of some twenty-seven years of age, with a frank and open, though somewhat careworn, aspect. I at once rose, and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be of service to him in anything, and I trust I did not betray any wounding suspicion that he was other than a man of flesh and blood.|$|E
60|$|I {{followed}} him {{up into his}} room, and <b>asked</b> him <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do anything for him. He flopped the hamper {{on the bed with}} a sigh of relief, took off his hat, wiped his head with his handkerchief, and then turned to answer me.|$|R
40|$|This brief {{article has}} {{its origins in}} the late 1960 s, but has been {{inspired}} by more recent work {{in the last two}} or three years. Howard Bergerson, the then editor of Word Ways, wrote me in July 1969 <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help fill any of the gaps in the list of words sent him by Ross Eckler, a list of words using the vowels AEIOU in the 120 different orders possible. Along with Dmitri Borgmann, I modestly filled a few gaps. The extended list eventually found its way into print as Ross Eckler 2 ̆ 7 s article 2 ̆ 2 Unsociable Housemaid Discourages Facetious Behaviour 2 ̆ 2 which appeared in the November 1969 Word Ways...|$|R
