40|$|Integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> {{planning}} of embedded systems {{is a task}} often performed by industry experts. The {{reason for this is}} the multi-disciplinary nature of the embedded system, the complexity of the components and their environment and the volatility of the integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plan. The Tangram research project aims at reducing the integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> duration of complex embedded systems, like ASML wafer scanners, without influencing the product quality or cost. Integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> planning is one of the areas where model-based techniques and algorithms can reduce the integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> duration. This paper presents a structured integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> planning method including several improvement cycles. This method is applicable for multi-disciplinary systems and can be used to guide the modeling and optimization effort of industrial-size integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans.

40|$|The {{integration}} <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plan of a {{newly developed}} or manufactured product often has a typical form in a specific organization. This paper describes a number of typical integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans encountered at various organizations with different business drivers. The integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans are described using the same simple notation. A number of aspects per organization is investigated: a typical integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plan, the organization size, product volume, business drivers, number of components in the product and the used technology. The investigated organizations are grouped according to product complexity and a rough classification of integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans: flexible <b>and</b> regulated integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans. We conclude that flexible integration <b>and</b> <b>test</b> plans are used in time-to-market driven organizations, while regulated plans are used for non-time-to-market driven organizations...|$|R
