The country's connectivity score (<b>a</b> <b>statistic</b> which measures both Internet access and fixed and mobile telephone lines) is 210.4 percent per person, while the regional average in Arab States of the Persian Gulf is 135.37 percent. The number of Bahraini internet users has risen from 40,000 in 2000 to 250,000 in 2008, or from 5.95 to 33 percent of the population. As of August 2013, the TRA has licensed 22 Internet Service Providers.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} <b>a</b> test <b>statistic</b> {{is that its}} sampling distribution under the null hypothesis must be calculable, either exactly or approximately, which allows p-values to be calculated. <b>A</b> test <b>statistic</b> shares {{some of the same}} qualities of <b>a</b> descriptive <b>statistic,</b> and many statistics can be used as both test statistics and descriptive statistics. However, <b>a</b> test <b>statistic</b> is specifically intended for use in statistical testing, whereas the main quality of <b>a</b> descriptive <b>statistic</b> is that it is easily interpretable. Some informative descriptive statistics, such as the sample range, do not make good test statistics since {{it is difficult to determine}} their sampling distribution.|$|R

5|$|In ice hockey, a {{combination}} of a player's goals and assists are collectively called points. Penalty minutes are the total number of minutes assigned to a player for infractions assessed during the season. Plus-minus is <b>a</b> <b>statistic</b> that tracks when a player was on the ice while goals were scored, both for and against their team, though some in game situations will not effect the statistic. Below is a listing of all player statistics for the Blue Jackets during the season.|$|E
5|$|Including the 20 seasons the League tracked plus-minus as <b>a</b> <b>statistic</b> {{without an}} award, the Boston Bruins {{have led the}} League 11 times (six by Bobby Orr and twice by David Krejci, the only other repeat leaders), Edmonton Oilers five times (four by Wayne Gretzky, {{including}} three official awards) and four times each by players on the Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers.|$|E
5|$|On September 23, Bonds surpassed Aaron for the NL career {{home run}} record. Hit in Milwaukee like the {{previous}} one, {{this was a}} solo home run off Chris Capuano of the Brewers. This was the last home run Bonds hit in 2006. In 2006, Bonds recorded his lowest slugging percentage (<b>a</b> <b>statistic</b> that he has historically ranked among league leaders season after season) since 1991 with the Pittsburgh Pirates.|$|E
50|$|In {{situations}} where <b>an</b> obvious <b>statistic</b> can be devised to measure a required characteristic using {{only a small}} number, r, of data items, <b>a</b> corresponding <b>statistic</b> based on the entire sample can be formulated. Given <b>an</b> r-sample <b>statistic,</b> one can create <b>an</b> n-sample <b>statistic</b> by something similar to bootstrapping (taking {{the average of the}} statistic over all subsamples of size r). This procedure is known to have certain good properties and the result is a U-statistic. The sample mean and sample variance are of this form, for r=1 and r=2.|$|R

He was retained on the Bombers' rookie list for 2003 and was again elevated to the senior list during the season. Although he was often named as an emergency after his promotion, Hall was unable to break into the senior team and Essendon delisted him at the end of 2003, ending his AFL career.|$|E
5|$|Sean Glennon's four {{turnovers}} tied {{a career-high}} for interceptions and brought his season interception mark to 11. He completed 13ofhis26passes for 94yards and a completion percentage of 50%. The passing total of 94yards was the second-lowest total {{in the entire}} season, coming behind only a November 4 game in Miami where Glennon passed for just 86yards {{in the face of}} a tough defense. In <b>a</b> <b>statistic</b> unusual for the 2006 season, Glennon was not the only Tech player to complete a pass. Wide receiver Eddie Royal's 53-yard TD pass made him just the third Virginia Tech player to complete a pass during the 2006 season. The play on which Royal made his throw, a lateral WR pass, had been attempted once previously in the season during a 38–27 loss to Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis and {{treatment}} cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including {{the amount of}} diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt {{to cover it up}} by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation, <b>a</b> <b>statistic</b> that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} Bayesian sensitivity analysis that uses <b>an</b> influence <b>statistic</b> and <b>an</b> outlier <b>statistic</b> to assess the sensitivity of a model to perturbations.

5|$|Rivera was a {{dominant}} reliever throughout his career, pitching with a consistency and longevity uncharacteristic {{of a role}} commonly marked by volatility and high turnover. In his 17-year tenure as the Yankees' closer, Rivera compiled considerable career numbers. A 13-time All-Star, he is the major leagues' all-time regular season leader in saves (652) and games finished (952). He pitched in 1,115 regular season games, which is fourth-most in MLB history, the most in AL history, and the most by a right-handed pitcher. Rivera holds or shares several records for the most seasons of reaching various save milestones, including seasons with at least: 20 saves (sixteen); 25 saves (fifteen consecutive, sixteen non-consecutive); 30 saves (nine consecutive, fifteen non-consecutive); 35 saves (twelve); 40 saves (nine); and 50 saves (two). Rivera's career ERA (2.21) and WHIP (1.00) are the lowest of any MLB pitcher in the live-ball era (minimum 1,000 innings pitched), making {{him one of the}} top pitchers since 1920 at preventing hitters from reaching base and scoring. He recorded an ERA under 2.00 in 11seasons, tying him with Walter Johnson for the most such seasons (minimum 60innings pitched each). Rivera also ranks first in career adjusted ERA+ (205), <b>a</b> <b>statistic</b> that adjusts ERA for league and ballpark to allow comparisons of pitchers on the same baseline.|$|E
5|$|When Dean Solomon {{suffered}} a season-ending knee injury in late March, Hall {{was one of}} three players in contention to be promoted to the senior list in place of Solomon. After approximately one month of assessment Hall was deemed the most impressive of Essendon's three rookies and was elevated to the senior list. In early June, Hall played particularly well in defence for the reserves against the Murray Kangaroos, and was subsequently in consideration to play for Essendon's senior team. Essendon had been plagued by injury throughout 2002 and this, coupled with Hall's good form in the VFL, resulted in him making his AFL debut in round 12 against Hawthorn. After a poor performance in his debut match, in which he did not record <b>a</b> <b>statistic</b> and spent most of the match on the bench, Hall was dropped backed to the VFL side the following round. Despite showing good form in the VFL for the remainder of 2002, Hall was unable to break back into the senior Bombers line-up. Although Hall failed to have an impact at AFL level, he played well at VFL level and was third in the reserves' best and fairest award.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, the Jets {{won their}} first two games. NFL players then staged a strike; a team {{composed}} mostly of replacement players lost two of the next three games. The locker room was divided after the strike due to the decision of a few players, led by Gastineau, to cross the picket line. The Jets remained in contention in a mediocre AFC East {{through much of the}} season, but dropped all four games in December to finish 6–9, in last place. In 1988, the Sack Exchange era ended as Joe Klecko failed his offseason physical and was waived, linebacker Lance Mehl announced his retirement during training camp, and Mark Gastineau retired midseason, citing personal reasons. In spite of these departures, the Jets finished with an 8–7–1 record. They secured a winning record by ending the season with a victory over the Giants, which cost their in-state rivals a playoff berth. The team performed badly in 1989, finishing 4–12. On December 18, 1989, the Jets hired executive Dick Steinberg from the New England Patriots to take over as general manager. Three days after New York's final game of the season, a 37–0 loss to the Bills at Giants Stadium, Steinberg fired Walton and began to search for the team's 10th coach. The disastrous 1989 campaign cost Walton the chance to be the first Jets coach to complete his career with a winning record, <b>a</b> <b>statistic</b> he later admitted he cared about deeply.|$|E

As {{a result of the}} injury, he withdrew from the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, and was replaced on the roster by Dirk Nowitzki and in the starting lineup by LaMarcus Aldridge. Davis missed five games in late February and early March to the shoulder sprain. He returned against the Detroit Pistons with a very dominant game performance of 39 points, 13 rebounds, and 8 blocks, numbers that only Hakeem Olajuwon and Dwight Howard had achieved in a game in the prior 30 years. Davis also reached 437 career blocks, a franchise record. On March 9, Davis tied his career high with 43 points and added 10 rebounds, 2 blocks and a steal in a 114-103 win against the Milwaukee Bucks. On March 15 in a double overtime game against the Denver Nuggets, Davis became the first player in NBA history to tally 36 points, 14 rebounds, 9 blocks and 7 assists in a game since blocks became <b>a</b> <b>statistic</b> in 1973. Only David Robinson has had at least 30 points, 11 rebounds, 8 blocks and 7 assists in a game. On March 16, Davis earned Western Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, March 9, through Sunday, March 15 and was a finalist for Western Conference Player of the Month of March. In the final game of the regular season, a must-win game that would send the Pelicans to the 2015 NBA Playoffs, Davis recorded 31 points, 13 rebounds, and 3 blocks in a 108-103 victory over the defending-champion San Antonio Spurs. The playoff berth was Davis' first and the franchise's first since 2011. Davis' season {{was one of the most}} impressive in NBA history, finishing the season averaging 24.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 2.9 blocks, and leading the league in player efficiency rating with 30.89.
