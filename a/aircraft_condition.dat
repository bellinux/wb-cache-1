40|$|AbstractThe <b>aircraft</b> <b>condition</b> {{monitoring}} {{network is}} responsible for collecting the status of each component in aircraft. The reliability of this network has {{a significant effect on}} safety of the aircraft. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>condition</b> monitoring network works in a real-time manner that all the data should be transmitted within the deadline to ensure that the control center makes proper decision in time. Only the connectedness between the source node and destination cannot guarantee the data to be transmitted in time. In this paper, we take the time deadline into account and build the task-based reliability model. The binary decision diagram (BDD), which has the merit of efficiency in computing and storage space, is introduced when calculating the reliability of the network and addressing the essential variable. A case is analyzed using the algorithm proposed in this paper. The experimental results show that our method is efficient and proper for the reliability analysis of the real-time network...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAnomaly {{detection}} is {{an important}} field for the anticipation of aircraft maintenance operations, working as an enabler of diagnostic and prognostic functions. A method has been implemented to detect abnormal data in <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Condition</b> Monitoring System (ACMS) records. Rather than using already known and usual detection triggers which are partial detectors and insensitive to new flight and system conditions, this method automatically extracts abnormal data points without requiring any a priori information about the system and its conditions. To accomplish this objective, we propose to combine a segmentation based and density clustering approaches for detecting and filtering anomalies. This method was applied on A 340 ACMS data recordings.

In the {{research}} of Prognostics and Health Manage-ment aiming at the airborne equipments such as aeroengines, the working state of equipments can be efficiently monitored based on the flight data acquired, recorded and transported to the ground database by the <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Condition</b> Monitoring System. Firstly, the conception of normal working performance model and the Polynomial Coefficient Auto-Regressive model are introduced in the paper to help identify the abnormality of equipments. Secondly, based on chi-square distribution model, the abnormality detection algorithm based on chi-square test of standardized error sum of squares and the abnormality detection algorithm based on chi-square test of distribution fitting are put forward to detect the equipments ’ latent damage or fault. Compared to the former, the later can effectively reduce the rate of false alarm, however response unpunctually to the equipment’s abnormality.

40|$|Structural health {{monitoring}} (SHM) is an emerging technology {{leading to the}} development of systems capable of continuously monitoring structures for damage to improve safety and reduce life-cycle costs. SHM involves integration of one or more non-destructive test methods into a vehicle in order to facilitate quick and accurate damage detection with minimal human intervention. Aerospace structures have one of the highest payoffs for SHM systems since damage can lead to catastrophic and expensive failures, and the vehicles involved undergo regular costly inspections. Current work in SHM has focused on damage detection methods and sensor optimization, however, the topics of durability, reliability, and longevity of these systems has not been sufficiently addressed. Experimental results from durability testing of piezoelectric Lamb-wave nodes (transceivers) are presented and a framework for developing SHM test standards is offered. Existing standards for the durability, reliability, and longevity of commercial and military aircraft components are identified, and the relation of their standards to SHM systems is discussed. These standards include susceptibility to environmental testing, mechanical durability, and electro-magnetic interference (EMI), as well as a host of other extreme <b>aircraft</b> <b>condition...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Some {{applications}} of RF MEMS switches, such as <b>aircraft</b> <b>condition</b> monitoring and distributed satellite communication, present a unique challenge for device design and reliability. This article examines these switches when operational {{temperatures in the}} range 60 °C to 100 °C are envisioned. The basic operation of a capacitive MEMS switch is described and two tools for examining device reliability, modeling, and on-chip experimentation, {{are discussed in the}} case of capacitive MEMS switches. 1 D, 2 D, and 3 D models are presented with emphasis on 3 D coupled-field finite-element analysis, including temperature effects. Results and findings from the 3 D simulations are reported. In particular, the advantages of employing corrugated membranes in the design of RF MEMS switches are assessed. Their performance in terms of reliability as a function of temperature is quantified. The effects of corrugation on the geometric parameters are discussed in the context of device-design optimization. In order to assess reliability experimentally, the M-test and the membrane deflection experiment (MDE) are reviewed due to their on-chip characteristic and simplicity. Ways in which these experimental/computational methodologies can be combined for identifying material proper-ties and device performance is also highlighted. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Abstract—This {{study used}} a {{human-in-the-loop}} simulation {{to examine the}} feasibility of mixed equipage operations in an automated separation assurance environment under higher traffic densities. The study involved two aircraft equipage alternatives – with and without data link – and four traffic conditions. In all traffic conditions the unequipped traffic count was increased linearly throughout the scenario from approximately 5 to 20 <b>aircraft.</b> <b>Condition</b> one consisted solely of this unequipped traffic, while the remaining three conditions also included a constant number of equipped aircraft operating within the same airspace: 15 equipped aircraft in condition two, 30 in condition three, and 45 in condition four. If traffic load became excessive during any run, participants were instructed to refuse sector entry to inbound unequipped aircraft until sector load became manageable. Results showed a progressively higher number of unequipped aircraft turned away under the second, third, and fourth scenario conditions. Controller workload also increased progressively. Participants rated the mixed operations concept as acceptable, with some qualifications about procedures and information displays. These results showed that mixed operations might be feasible in the same airspace, if unequipped aircraft count is held to a workable level. This level will decrease with increasing complexity. The results imply that integrated airspace configuration is feasible to a limit. The results also indicate that the conflict detection and resolution automation, equipage, and traffic density are important factors that {{will need to be}} considered for airspace configuration...|$|E

40|$|For any machine {{designed}} to generate power, or {{to fulfill its}} functions in general, maintenance actions {{will have an impact}} on many aspects of its overall capabilities, especially its performance and the length of its useful life. Since these are vital in order to generate maximum profit, the maintenance actions that affect them must be given serious consideration. For this reason, this research aims to propose a method that will enhance the cost saving potential with more accurately determined maintenance intervals and greater exploitation of the remaining life of the components by utilizing the capabilities of condition based monitoring. Initially, the research focuses on the description and the understanding of maintenance methods as they are performed within the aviation industry, but it also aims to investigate the state of the art Condition Based Monitoring Maintenance (CBMM) and its associated advantaged relating to the older methods. The thesis begins by describing the fundamental aviation maintenance management domains, paying particular attention to CBMM, and continues with the diagnostic and prognostic methods that are in use in order to support the condition monitoring concept. Next, a description is given of the actual implementations of the CBMM process, with the presentation of the maintenance enhancement systems, namely the Central Maintenance System and the <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Condition</b> Monitoring System. Lastly, a case study is presented of the estimation of the remaining useful life of a turbine blade, as it relates to the primary failure mode of creep. The case study endorses the use of the condition monitoring diagnostic methods discussed previously and also aims to demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the Engine Usage Diagnostics at both the design and the into-service stage. The created/simulated engine performance models concern several operating conditions of the engine while the impact of each of those on the remaining useful life of the blade is investigated. The benefit of this research is that it proposes a practical, effective, and relatively easy way to perform maintenance by predicting the need according to the usage. Additionally, the data required have already been measured, which paves the way for the creation of more intelligent engine control units. The contribution and innovation of the research is demonstrated by the fact that no similar approaches to creep life prediction have been published for the same type of engine, namely the CFM 56 5 B 2. Last but not least, the results are presented in the most beneficial form of remaining hours before the failure...|$|E
