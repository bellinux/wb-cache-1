5|$|After Icos's {{experimental}} drugs {{failed in}} clinical trials, Eli Lilly {{was in a}} prime position to purchase the company. In October2006, Eli Lilly announced that it had reached terms to acquire Icos for $2.1billion, or $32 a share. After receiving pressure from large institutional shareholders as well as proxy <b>advisory</b> <b>firm</b> Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) suggesting the deal should be rejected, Lilly increased its offer to $2.3billion or $34 per share, a 6% increase. Again, resistance was voiced by some large shareholders, and ISS advised shareholders against accepting the new offer, which it still deemed insufficient. On January 25, 2007, at a special meeting, 77% of the shareholders voted {{in support of the}} acquisition. Eli Lilly closed the transaction to acquire Icos for $2.3billion on January29, 2007.|$|E

40|$|I {{describe}} {{in detail the}} structure of separately managed accounts (SMAs) and how those accounts compare to and differ from mutual funds and hedge funds. I then examine how employee ownership of <b>advisory</b> <b>firms</b> — that is, firms in which employees have partnership or stock interests — affects the performance, idiosyncratic risk, and R-square of each firm’s SMA portfolios. In testing 14, 484 different portfolios from more than 1, 100 different <b>advisory</b> <b>firms</b> from 1995 to 2015, I find that SMAs at firms with employee ownership outperform SMAs at firms without it. The greatest impact is in the 25 – 50 % employee-ownership range. Positive returns, risk, and all decrease as employee ownership increases beyond 50 %, but SMA performance levels remain above those of firms in which the portfolio manager has no employee ownership. I also find that the Sharpe ratio is negatively related to employee ownership, reflecting a deterioration of risk-adjusted returns at higher employee-ownership levels. These results suggest both {{that the presence of}} advisor employee ownership is a significant, positive indicator for SMA performance and that those <b>advisory</b> <b>firms</b> assume more idiosyncratic risk to achieve these higher returns. For investors, my results show that employee ownership of <b>advisory</b> <b>firms</b> {{can be used as a}} differentiating factor to aid them in making SMA choices between portfolios with otherwise similar characteristics...|$|R

China was already a world leader in certain areas such as rare earth elements. China has imposed export quotas on rare earth elements, 95% of which are mined in China, citing environmental issues, but has been accused of wanting to force high-tech industry using rare earth elements to move to China.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{diagnostic}} test provider Gen-Probe Inc. {{announced that they}} would not accept the resignation of Jemison from their Board of Directors. Jemison had failed to be re-elected to the board in a vote of the shareholders of the company at the company's May 31 annual stockholders meeting. The company said it believed that Jemison's failed re-election {{was the result of a}} recommendation by <b>advisory</b> <b>firm</b> Institutional Shareholder Services that shareholders vote against her due to her poor attendance at board meetings. Gen-Probe determined that Jemison's two absences in 2006 were for valid reasons and said Jemison had attended all regular and special board and committee meetings since September.|$|E

25|$|An {{opinion poll}} in Britain in 2002 by MORI {{on behalf of}} Greenpeace showed large support for wind power and a {{majority}} for {{putting an end to}} nuclear energy if the costs were the same.

The same survey also revealed high public expectations for the future rate of renewables development – with 35% expecting the majority of electricity to come from renewables in only 15 years, which is more than double the government's expectation.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{determine}} whether <b>advisory</b> <b>firms</b> valuing privately-owned companies in South Africa take unsystematic risk into account and, if they do, how objectively it is done. A literature search was reviewed and used as a foundation in a questionnaire to gather information from the big four audit, <b>advisory</b> and taxation <b>firms</b> (PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Deloitte & Touch and Ernst & Young). The study found that unsystematic risk is incorporated into privately-owned company valuations, but that the whole subject of valuations, especially privately-owned company valuations, does not entail entire objectivity. The study further concluded {{that it is possible to}} use unsystematic risk as a device to bring the final results of a valuation in line with the clients’ objective. Further research should be done by extending the population to include medium- and large <b>advisory</b> <b>firms</b> and comparing the approaches used by each group. [URL]...|$|R
