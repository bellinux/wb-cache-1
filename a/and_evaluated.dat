TSSM was competing against the Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) {{proposal for}} funding. In February 2009, it was announced that NASA/ESA had given the EJSM mission priority ahead of TSSM, although TSSM will continue to be studied <b>and</b> <b>evaluated.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1969, a 500 MW {{nuclear power}} plant was {{proposed}} for the Jervis Bay Territory, 200km south of Sydney. A local opposition campaign began, and the South Coast Trades and Labour Council (covering workers in the region) {{announced that it would}} refuse to build the reactor. Some environmental studies and site works were completed, and two rounds of tenders were called <b>and</b> <b>evaluated,</b> but in 1971 the Australian government decided not to proceed with the project, citing economic reasons.|$|E

The investigation into the collapse of 1WTC and 2WTC was concluded in October 2005 and that of 7WTC was completed in August 2008.|$|E

5|$|An {{experimental}} fire-control {{director was}} fitted {{in the forward}} spotting top <b>and</b> <b>evaluated</b> in May 1910. The guns on the forward turret roof were transferred to the superstructure in 1913–1914 and the roof guns from the wing turrets were remounted in the aft superstructure about a year later; all of the four-inch guns in the superstructure were enclosed to better protect their crews. In addition, a single three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added on the former searchlight platform between the aft turrets. Shortly afterwards, the guns on the aft turret were removed as were one pair from the superstructure. Around the same time another three-inch AA gun {{was added to the}} aft turret roof.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1954, Australia {{recognised}} that the English Electric Canberra was becoming outdated <b>and</b> <b>evaluated</b> aircraft {{such as the}} Avro Vulcan and Handley-Page Victor as potential replacements. Political pressure for a Canberra replacement only rose to a head in 1962; at which point more modern types such as the BAC TSR-2, General Dynamics F-111C, and North American A-5 Vigilante had become available. The RAF would have transferred several V-bombers, including Vulcans, for interim use by the RAAF if they had purchased the TSR-2, but the RAAF selected the F-111C.|$|E
5|$|Cheyenne {{prototype}} #6 (s/n 66-8831) began conducting weapons {{testing at}} Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, demonstrating {{the ability for}} the gunner and pilot to accurately fire on separate targets on each side on the helicopter. Towards the end of 1970, the Army funded work on TOW missile guidance and night sighting systems. Prototypes #6 and #9 were also tested <b>and</b> <b>evaluated</b> at Yuma Proving Ground from 30 January to 23 December 1971, to determine if stability and control systems were sufficient. Deficiencies were identified in lateral directional stability, uncommanded motion during maneuvering, high vibration, and poor directional control during sidewards flying.|$|E

5|$|Edward Hack {{developed}} {{the original idea}} and model of lemon juice being contained inside lemon-shaped and coloured packaging in the 1950s. The product was then designed and produced by Cascelloid Ltd. Hack presented Cascelloid with a fresh lemon he acquired at Covent Garden, upon which to base the plastic container. Hack had performed significant searches at several markets to find an optimal model. Cascelloid stated that Hack reviewed <b>and</b> <b>evaluated</b> the entire inventory of lemons at Fortnum and Mason’s, Selfridges, Harrods and Covent Garden, the latter of which involved examining three cases of lemons that contained around 300 lemons in each case.|$|E
5|$|Katniss and Peeta {{are taken}} to the Capitol. In the {{few days before the}} Games start, they are advised and {{supported}} by a team consisting of their drunken mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, the sole living District 12 victor of the Hunger Games; Effie Trinket; and two fashion stylists and three prep workers who help each tribute look his or her best. Katniss's stylist, Cinna, is the only person at the Capitol she considers a friend. They are also introduced to the general public, given some training, <b>and</b> <b>evaluated</b> by the Gamemakers. Katniss and, to a lesser extent, Peeta set themselves apart from the other tributes. Rue, the petite 12-year-old girl tribute from District 11, takes to following them around.|$|E
5|$|Small batch {{production}} of the single-seat, single-engine JF-17s began in China in June 2006.

They took part in an aerial display on 23 March 2007 {{as part of the}} Pakistan Day Joint Services Parade in Islamabad. Another six small-batch-produced aircraft were delivered by March 2008. These were extensively flight-tested <b>and</b> <b>evaluated</b> by the PAF. Two serial production aircraft were delivered from China in 2009 and the first Pakistani-manufactured aircraft was delivered to the PAF in a ceremony on 23 November 2009.|$|E

5|$|The best bulls go to {{artificial}} insemination (AI) cooperatives where semen is taken. AI allows the wide distribution of a bulls' genetics {{to the benefit}} of more farmers. However, in order to guarantee their genetic qualities, the bulls are subject to a strict selection scheme to increase the accuracy of the different genetic indexes. The best bulls identified at Lanaud are sent to another test station at Naves in Corrèze. Here they are tested more accurately <b>and</b> <b>evaluated</b> for feed conversion efficiency, growth and muscle development. Progeny of the top 10 bulls out of this testing, and the best natural service bulls, are then evaluated. Cows are inseminated to produce 60 to 80 calves per bull tested, which are in turn evaluated.|$|E
