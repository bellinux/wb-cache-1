5|$|At Bristol Road, PA 263 enters Warwick Township {{and becomes}} a four-lane divided highway <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> north and runs through wooded areas with some homes, {{crossing}} Little Neshaminy Creek. The route regains a center left-turn lane as it reaches an intersection with Almshouse Road {{in the community of}} Jamison. At this intersection, the route is briefly a divided highway. After Almshouse Road, PA 263 continues north through business areas before heading past residential development. The route turns back into a divided highway as it crosses over the Neshaminy Creek and passes through areas woodland and homes. The road leaves Warwick Township for Buckingham Township at the Sugar Bottom Road intersection.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Ticonderoga, NY9N passes through a valley before curving to the east and {{entering}} the hamlet of Ticonderoga. For the most part, NY9N bypasses the community <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> north onto Wicker Street, the westernmost north–south through street in the hamlet. Northwest of the former village's center, NY9N meets NY22 and NY74, the latter of which serves as a northerly bypass of Ticonderoga. NY22 joins NY9N here, following the route out of the hamlet.|$|E

5|$|SR 11 {{starts at}} Jennings Randolph Bridge, and becomes {{concurrent}} with US 30 and SR 39 <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> southwest. The concurrency bends around East Liverpool, SR 39 leaves the concurrency, and SR 7 joins it. The route finally turns north and leaves East Liverpool. It turns northwest, near the southern terminus of SR 170. It intersects the concurrency termini of SR 7 and US 30 {{in these three}} miles. SR 11 travels through forests, passes by Lisbon, only connecting with SR 154 at an interchange. The highway travels north to near Leetonia, where it meets SR 344 at a diamond interchange. The forests slowly change into farmland, as it passes under SR 14 and into Mahoning County.|$|E
5|$|The route {{begins on}} the {{southern}} edge of Tillsonburg at Highway3 (Talbot Road), travelling north along the eastern side of Big Otter Creek. This section of the highway, known as Vienna Road, lies next to a business/industrial park. At County Road51 (Simcoe Street), Vienna Road ends and Highway19 turns west, becoming Oxford Street and crossing Big Otter Creek. At Broadway Street, Highway19 turns northwest and passes through the downtown strip as well as beside Tillsonburg Town Centre. It continues into residential subdivisions, eventually exiting the town into the municipality of South-West Oxford <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> north at Quarter Town Line and becomes Plank Line.|$|E
5|$|The route {{continues}} north, {{serving as}} the boundary between Searingtown and Albertson as it proceeds past side streets lined by homes. At I.U. Willets Road, CR101 serves Henry Wiscardi School and enters Searingtown. Just inside of the community, CR101 intersects Hilldale Drive and Dogwood Road, two local streets connecting to Herricks Middle School. The route continues on through Searingtown into the village of North Hills, where the homes give way to trees <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> to the northeast and passes under the Northern State Parkway. A short distance after the Northern Parkway overpass, CR101 meets the Long Island Expressway (Interstate495) by way of Nassau Boulevard—the southern service road—and North Service Road.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Katy and her boyfriend (played by actor and model Brian Nagel) have crashed their plane {{in the middle of the}} jungle. Katy shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a tarantula crawling on her. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E
5|$|East of I-405, SR522 enters Woodinville {{and follows}} Little Bear Creek <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> north {{away from the}} city's downtown, {{intersecting}} SR202. The freeway enters Snohomish County and intersects SR9 south of the Brightwater sewage treatment plant. It continues in a stairstep pattern, moving north and east with sharp turns to parallel the Eastside Rail Corridor, through a predominantly rural area In Maltby, the freeway reaches an at-grade intersection with Paradise Lake Road (SR524) and becomes a two-lane undivided highway. SR522 travels northeast from Maltby, intersecting Echo Lake Road in a single-point urban interchange, and crosses the Snohomish River into Monroe. Within Monroe, the highway widens to a four-lane freeway with median separation and intersects Main Street in a dogbone interchange near the Monroe Correctional Complex. SR522 cuts across suburban housing areas in Monroe, and crosses over US2 and the BNSF Railway near the Evergreen State Fairgrounds. The highway makes a 180-degree turn south to intersect with US2, where it terminates; the intersection also has a direct offramp for eastbound traffic from SR522 to eastbound US2.|$|E
5|$|Following the interchange, US30 enters Waterford Township, as {{it passes}} near the {{community}} of Atco. The road turns south {{as it passes}} Atco Lake and continues into more wooded areas with some development, eventually heading south-southeast again. New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line runs a short distance to the northeast of the route at this point. US30 continues through Chesilhurst before it enters Winslow Township. Here, the route intersects CR536 and forms a short concurrency with that route before it heads to the east. From this point, the road continues into a mix of woodland, farmland, and development. US30 intersects Route143 and passes over the Atlantic City Line <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> southeast. The road makes another turn to the south as it crosses CR723.|$|E

5|$|It remains {{close to}} the Interstate Highway for about , {{intersecting}} NY237 {{less than a mile}} (1.6km) north of the overpass taking that highway over the Thruway, but leaves it behind for good shortly thereafter <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> even more to the north, taking it into the town of Bergen and the small village of the same name in the county's northeast corner. Here, NY33 crosses NY19, a long north–south route. Shortly afterward, NY33A begins to the east while the main route turns to the north yet again and becomes Buffalo Road. Just east of this point, NY33A connects to I-490, which briefly runs along the Monroe County line through this area. From the west end of NY33A to the county line, NY33 and I-490 follow virtually identical northeasterly alignments.|$|E
5|$|M-119 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with US31 about four miles (6.4km) northeast of Petoskey near {{the community of}} Bay View in Bear Creek Township. The highway runs north between Petoskey State Park on the west and Round Lake on the east as it rounds {{the east end of}} Little Traverse Bay. The trunkline passes the eastern and northern edges of the Harbor Springs Municipal Airport <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> westward near the junction with C-81 (Pleasantview Road). Through this area, M-119 runs through the community of Wequetonsing and forests just inland from the bay's northern shore. As it passes into the city limits of Harbor Springs, the highway follows Main Street into downtown. It turns north and then westward along State Street in the middle of town, intersecting the southern end of C-77 in the central business district. M-119 continues westward, passing through a residential area on Bluff Drive as it leaves the city.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) demands {{compensation}} for her voice work in Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) pornographic video game, Gorgasm: The Legend of Dong Slayer. The argument escalates and Liz orders {{them to stop}} their bickering. After Liz leaves for Chicago, Jenna and Tracy decide to conduct a social experiment to see whether Tracy can survive better as a white woman than Jenna can as a black man, after arguing respectively that black men and white women have it harder in society. Later, while on her flight, Liz takes Jack's sedative. Liz realizes that the woman {{sitting next to her}} is Oprah Winfrey. When Liz arrives back at the 30 Rock studios, Tracy is dressed in female drag with his body covered in white makeup and soon after, Jenna enters in blackface and male drag. Jack worries that the situation has gone out of control, but Liz assures him that Oprah, who is coming to the studios, {{will be able to make}} them come to terms. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> out, her inflight conversation with Oprah was a hallucination. The person who Liz thought was Oprah is actually a 12-year-old girl named Pam (Raven Goodwin). Even so, Pam engages Tracy and Jenna in a heart-to-heart, and manages to settle their differences.|$|E
5|$|The route {{passes to}} the west of the Golden Nugget casino and comes to a ramp that {{provides}} access from northbound Route 87 to both the Trump Marina and Harrah's Atlantic City casinos before passing under the northbound Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector again. Immediately after, the route has a ramp from the southbound direction that provides access to the connector and westbound U.S. Route 30. The northbound Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector parallels Route 87 to the east <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> northeast and comes to a right-in/right-out in the southbound direction that serves both Harrah's and Borgata. From here, the route passes to the southeast of Harrah's. The northbound Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector merges onto northbound Route 87 before the route comes to a ramp that provides access to the northbound direction of the route from Harrah's. Past here, the route crosses over the Absecon Channel on the Justice Vincent S. Haneman Memorial Bridge and runs along the border of Atlantic City to the northwest and Brigantine to the southeast. After crossing the Absecon Channel, the route arrives on Brigantine Island and passes through wetlands, with U-turn ramps in both directions. A short distance later, Route 87 ends and County Route 638 continues along Brigantine Boulevard through Brigantine.|$|E
5|$|When Joan {{comes to}} speak with Charles, the Dauphin pretends to be a common member of the court while someone else pretends to be him. Joan is able {{to see through the}} ruse and {{immediately}} proclaims that she is sent to restore the French crown to him at Rheims. Charles has her examined by priests and scholars to determine that she is free of black magic. While questioned, Joan describes how God came to her with visions and describes her faith in a similar manner to deism. This causes the examiners to believe that she is a heretic until a blue flame appears along with a sound, which is enough to silence any doubts about her faith. The flame reveals a suit of armour for her, but one individual interrupts her immediate donning of the armour to claim that France is cursed and that she would be a victim. The individual, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> out, is Conrade, who blames himself that Joan left her peaceful life to help a French court that was corrupt. He also warns her that he experienced a vision of her burning at the stake.|$|E
