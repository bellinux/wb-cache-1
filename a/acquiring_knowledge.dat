5|$|In 1957, Rand {{published}} her best-known work, {{the novel}} Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, {{she turned to}} non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982. Rand advocated reason as {{the only means of}} <b>acquiring</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism, and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral, and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism, and instead supported laissez-faire capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights, including property rights. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and classical liberals.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the concept of}} <b>acquired</b> <b>knowledge</b> (‘ilm al-ÍuÎËlÊ) in the discourse of Muslim scholars {{in relation to the}} reforms made by many Muslim scholars and thinkers such as al-ShÉfi‘Ê (d. 204 / 820), al-GhazÉlÊ (d. 505 / 1111) and al-DihlawÊ (d. 1176 / 1762). Al-ShÉfi‘Ê contributed much to this field with his classification of knowledge into two categories, ‘ilm al-‘Émmah and ‘ilm al-khÉÎÎah. Al-GhazÉlÊ, who developed ‘ilm al-mu‘Émalah and al-mukÉshafah, suggested a method of revivification (iÍyÉ’) in order to integrate the sciences of <b>acquired</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Al-DihlawÊ developed and classified knowledge into ‘ilm al-ÍuÌËrÊ and al-ÍuÎËlÊ, and suggested the concept of taÏbÊq in reforming <b>acquired</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Their discussions on the reformation of <b>acquired</b> <b>knowledge</b> have paved the way for modern scholars to derive concepts for the integration of human knowledge...|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} stories also exist telling of Chaitanya's {{apparent}} {{attraction to the}} chanting and singing of Krishna's names from a very young age, but largely this was perceived as being secondary to his interest in <b>acquiring</b> <b>knowledge</b> and studying Sanskrit. When travelling to Gaya to perform the shraddha ceremony for his departed father, Chaitanya met his guru, the ascetic Ishvara Puri, from whom he received initiation with the Gopala Krishna mantra. This meeting was to mark {{a significant change in}} Chaitanya's outlook and upon his return to Bengal the local Vaishnavas, headed by Advaita Acharya, were stunned at his external sudden 'change of heart' (from 'scholar' to 'devotee') and soon Chaitanya became the eminent leader of their Vaishnava group within Nadia.|$|E

Gaining an [...] "enlightened education", the princess learned to speak French, German, Latin, and English, liked history and was taught economics, geography, mathematics, politics, art, and music. Lehzen was strict, but rewarded the princess when she was obedient. In another departure from the era, Lehzen employed little to no corporal punishment; at least, there is no record of it in the household accounts.|$|E

2500|$|The Objectivist {{theory of}} art flows from its epistemology, {{by way of}} [...] "psycho-epistemology" [...] (Rand's term for an individual's {{characteristic}} mode of functioning in <b>acquiring</b> <b>knowledge).</b> Art, according to Objectivism, serves a human cognitive need: it allows human beings to grasp concepts {{as though they were}} percepts. Objectivism defines [...] "art" [...] as a [...] "selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments"—that is, according to what the artist believes to be ultimately true and important about the nature of reality and humanity. In this respect Objectivism regards art as a way of presenting abstractions concretely, in perceptual form.|$|E
2500|$|Another unique {{aspect of}} human culture and thought is the {{development}} of complex methods for <b>acquiring</b> <b>knowledge</b> through observation, quantification, and verification.

2500|$|Methodological naturalism {{does not}} concern itself with claims about what exists, but with methods of {{learning}} what nature is. [...] It attempts {{to explain and}} test scientific endeavors, hypotheses, and events with reference to natural causes and events. This second {{sense of the term}} [...] "naturalism" [...] seeks to provide a framework within which to conduct the scientific study of the laws of nature. [...] Methodological naturalism is a way of <b>acquiring</b> <b>knowledge.</b> It is a distinct system of thought concerned with a cognitive approach to reality, and is thus a philosophy of knowledge. Studies by sociologist Elaine Ecklund suggest that religious scientists in practice apply methodological naturalism. They report that their religious beliefs affect the way they think about the implications - often moral - of their work, but not the way they practice science.|$|E

Jokingly referring to themselves as [...] "savages", the pair integrated well. Pâquet soon demonstrated, in addition to theology, a keen interest in people and events, commenting on the inner politics and controversies of the time such as the Montreal ultramontanes' struggle, under the leadership of Ignace Bourget, to establish an independent university. He rapidly began <b>acquiring</b> <b>knowledge</b> about the Roman Curia and develop connections with various figures.

[...] As a precautionary measure, Heisuke advised that Japan should make movements to start developing and colonizing Ezo in order to prohibit Russian expansion into Ezo. [...] In response to Heisuke’s advice on Ezo, Tanuma Okitsugu, a member of the rōjū, attempted to begin colonization of Ezo yet unfortunately, was removed from office in 1786, and the development of Ezo ceased (Gramlich-Oka, 2001: 4-5).
