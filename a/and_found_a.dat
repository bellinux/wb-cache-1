5|$|Around 1657, Ruisdael {{moved to}} Amsterdam, by then a prosperous city which {{was likely to}} have offered a bigger market for his work. His fellow Haarlem painter Allaert van Everdingen had already moved to Amsterdam <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> market there. On June 17, 1657 he was baptized in Ankeveen, near Naarden. Ruisdael {{lived and worked in}} Amsterdam {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1668, his name appears as a witness to the {{marriage}} of Meindert Hobbema, his only registered pupil, a painter whose works have been confused with Ruisdael's own.|$|E
5|$|Binary interactions. Rajagopala et al. (2014) {{have carried}} out {{systematic}} yeast two-hybrid screens with most E. coli proteins, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> total of 2,234 protein-protein interactions. This study also integrated genetic interactions and protein structures and mapped 458 interactions within 227 protein complexes.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{there is}} no {{licensed}} vaccine for HIV or AIDS. The most effective vaccine trial to date, RV 144, was published in 2009 <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> partial reduction {{in the risk of}} transmission of roughly 30%, stimulating some hope in the research community of developing a truly effective vaccine. Further trials of the RV 144 vaccine are ongoing.|$|E

5|$|If {{there is}} a halo effect {{spreading}} to anything connected to the self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters. LeBel and Campbell tested this <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> name-letter effect for initials of subjects' partners. DeHart, Pelham, Fiedorowicz, Carvallo, and Gabriel concluded that the effect applies to parent-child, sibling and friendship relationships as well.|$|E
5|$|In 1770, Peter Simon Pallas {{visited the}} same site as Lehmann <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> red lead mineral that had useful {{properties}} as a pigment in paints. The use of Siberian red lead as a paint pigment then developed rapidly. A bright yellow pigment made from crocoite also became popular.|$|E
5|$|In 1865, Agneta met Jacob Cornelis van Marken, {{known as}} Jacques, who studied {{technology}} and {{sociology at the}} Polytechnical School of Delft, a precursor of the Delft University of Technology. During his studies he took a study tour to Austria-Hungary <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> new method of producing yeast, which fascinated him. Later, {{when he heard a}} baker in Delft complain about the varying quality and poor availability of yeast in the Netherlands, he recalled the method which he learnt during his tour, and decided to produce industrial baker's yeast of consistently high quality.|$|E

5|$|In 2008 a {{team from}} Calvin College {{examined}} the light curves of a debiased sample of ten Jupiter trojans, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> median spin period of 18.9 hours. This value {{was significantly higher than}} that for main-belt asteroids of similar size (11.5 hours). The difference could mean that the Jupiter trojans possess a lower average density, which may imply that they formed in the Kuiper belt (see below).|$|E
5|$|NBC {{canceled}} the show after three seasons; the last original episode aired on June 3, 1969. The petition {{near the end}} of the second season to save the show signed by many Caltech students and its multiple Hugo nominations would, however, indicate that despite low Nielsen ratings, it was highly popular with science fiction fans and engineering students. The series later became popular in reruns <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> cult following.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{software}} {{states are}} vulnerable to rowhammer attacks. An attacker thus needs to find right target states in order to utilize rowhammer errors. In practice, {{one of the main}} challenges is in identifying target states. Such typically have been done by domain experts. The mainstream fault tolerance community responded to rowhammer attacks with a systematic methodology which can be used to identify, validate, and evaluate rowhammer attack target states and their exploitability. That work is based on the well-established fault injection-based experimental methodology, and generalized attack target states <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> few practical target states that were previously unknown.|$|E

5|$|On April 6, 2007 at {{approximately}} 10 AM, Howard and Maureen Cotterman drove from Mexico to the Lukeville Port of Entry (POE). Upon arrival, the inspector checked the U.S. Customs and Border Protection electronic database <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> computer-generated alert, based upon Howard Cotterman's prior conviction for child sex crimes in 1992. The alert advised the inspector {{to be on}} the lookout for child pornography and due to the warning, the Cottermans were sent to a secondary inspection area.|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday, April 29, Black went to Lee's {{residence}} at 11a.m. looking for evidence, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> blood-smeared shirt {{at the bottom}} of a burn barrel. The blood was smeared high up on the armpits and the shirt smelled unused, suggesting to the police that it was a plant. The detectives, suspicious of Frank due to his nervous behavior throughout his interviews, believed that Frank had arranged the plant.|$|E
5|$|Once Tamar {{succeeded in}} {{consolidating}} her power <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> reliable support in David Soslan, the Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli, Toreli, and other noble families, she revived the expansionist {{foreign policy of}} her predecessors. Repeated occasions of dynastic strife in Georgia combined with the efforts of regional successors of the Great Seljuq Empire, such as the Ildenizid atabegs of Azerbaijan, Shirvanshahs, and the Ahlatshahs, had slowed down the dynamic of the Georgians achieved during the reigns of Tamar's great-grandfather, David IV, and her father, George III. However, the Georgians became again active under Tamar, more prominently in the second decade of her rule.|$|E

5|$|The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket was {{published}} and widely reviewed in 1838. In {{the summer of}} 1839, Poe became assistant editor of Burton's Gentleman's Magazine. He published numerous articles, stories, and reviews, enhancing {{his reputation as a}} trenchant critic which he had established at the Southern Literary Messenger. Also in 1839, the collection Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque {{was published}} in twovolumes, though he made little money from it and it received mixed reviews. Poe left Burton's after about a year <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> position as assistant at Graham's Magazine.|$|E
5|$|The salvage {{party were}} {{suspicious}} of Keseberg's story, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> pot full of human flesh {{in the cabin}} along with George Donner's pistols, jewelry, and $250 in gold. They threatened to lynch Keseberg, who confessed that he had cached $273 of the Donners' money at Tamsen's suggestion, {{so that it could}} one day benefit her children. On April 29, 1847, Keseberg was the last member of the Donner Party to arrive at Sutter's Fort.|$|E
5|$|When the Bank Street {{ground was}} {{temporarily}} closed by bailiffs in 1902, club captain Harry Stafford raised {{enough money to}} pay for the club's next away game at Bristol City <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> temporary ground at Harpurhey for the next reserves game against Padiham. Following financial investment, new club president John Henry Davies paid £500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street. Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.|$|E

A further check of a Bisbee corral turned up both Spence and Stilwell, who were arrested by sheriff's deputies Billy Breakenridge and Nagel.|$|E
5|$|A letter Hess {{wrote to}} his wife dated 4 November 1940 shows {{that in spite of}} not {{receiving}} a reply from Hamilton, he intended to proceed with his plan. He began training on the Messerschmitt Bf 110, a two-seater twin-engine aircraft, in October 1940 under instructor Wilhelm Stör, the chief test pilot at Messerschmitt. He continued to practice, including logging many cross-country flights, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> specific aircraft that handled well—a Bf 110E-1/N—which was from then on held in reserve for his personal use. He asked for a radio compass, modifications to the oxygen delivery system, and large long-range fuel tanks to be installed on this plane, and these requests were granted by March 1941.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{periodic}} law, dubnium should belong to group 5, under vanadium, niobium, and tantalum. Several studies investigated {{the properties of}} element 105 <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> general agreement with the predictions from {{the periodic}} law. Significant deviations may nevertheless occur, due to relativistic effects, which dramatically change physical properties on both atomic and macroscopic scales. (Relativistic effects arise when an object moves on velocities comparable to the speed of light; in heavy atoms, the quickly moving objects are electrons revolving around the nucleus.) These properties have remained challenging to measure: studies have only been performed on single atoms; they generally confirm the assignment of dubnium to the position under tantalum in the periodic table.|$|E
