25|$|Last week, Frank Hawks {{shuttled}} to East Aurora, N. Y. to {{show off}} his polliwog to a prospect, Sportsman J. Hazard Campbell. He landed neatly on the polo field in a nearby estate at about 5 p.m., climbed out, chatted awhile with Prospect Campbell and a cluster of friends. Presently he and Campbell took off smartly, cleared a fence, went atilt between two tall trees, and passed from sight. Then there was a rending crash, <b>a</b> <b>smear</b> <b>of</b> flame, silence. Half a mile the fearful group raced from the polo field. From the crackling wreck they pulled Frank Hawks; from beneath a burning wing, Prospect Campbell — both fatally hurt. The ship that could not stub its toe aground had tripped on overhead telephone wires.|$|E
2500|$|The {{diagnosis}} is usually incidental when the host passes a worm in the stool or vomit. [...] The eggs {{can be seen}} in <b>a</b> <b>smear</b> <b>of</b> fresh feces examined on a glass slide under a microscope and there are various techniques to concentrate them first or increase their visibility, such as the ether sedimentation method or the Kato technique. The eggs have a characteristic shape: they are oval with a thick, mamillated shell (covered with rounded mounds or lumps), measuring 35-50 micrometer in diameter and 40-70 [...] in length. [...] During pulmonary disease, larvae may be found in fluids aspirated from the lungs. White blood cells counts may demonstrate peripheral eosinophilia; this is common in many parasitic infections and is not specific to ascariasis.

2500|$|The hole walls for boards {{with two}} or more layers can be made {{conductive}} and then electroplated with copper to form plated-through holes. [...] These holes electrically connect the conducting layers of the PCB. For multi-layer boards, those with three layers or more, drilling typically produces <b>a</b> <b>smear</b> <b>of</b> the high temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system. Before the holes can be plated through, this smear must be removed by a chemical de-smear process, or by plasma-etch. The de-smear process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through. On high reliability boards a process called etch-back is performed chemically with a potassium permanganate based etchant or plasma. [...] The etch-back removes resin and the glass fibers so that the copper layers extend into the hole and as the hole is plated become integral with the deposited copper.|$|E

50|$|When a {{secondary}} lobe hits a reflective target {{such as a}} mountain or a strong thunderstorm, some of the energy is reflected to the radar. This energy is relatively weak but arrives {{at the same time}} that the central peak is illuminating a different azimuth. The echo is thus misplaced by the processing program. This has the effect of actually broadening the real weather echo making <b>a</b> <b>smearing</b> <b>of</b> weaker values on each side of it.
