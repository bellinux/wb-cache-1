40|$|Objective. In this article, {{we explore}} whether African-American state legislators {{have been able}} to {{translate}} election to office into positions of power, particularly <b>as</b> committee <b>chairs.</b> Methods. We cull data from all state legislative chambers that contained a black legislator during two time periods, 1989 and 1999. In doing so, we compare the observed numbers of African-American chairs with their expected numbers. We also examine each state’s percentage of black chairs using multiple regression to determine what factors—political, partisan, institutional, cultural— influence the selection of black committee chairs. Results. Overall, our descriptive analysis reveals that blacks are underrepresented <b>as</b> <b>chairs.</b> They are not, however, significantly underrepresented <b>as</b> <b>chairs</b> of the most important committees and they are generally overrepresented <b>as</b> <b>chairs</b> of committees with jurisdiction over social services. Our multivariate analyses show that the prevalence of black chairs is driven primarily by factors related to partisan control of legislative chambers and size of the black legislative delegation, and that these dynamics have changed over time.

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>chair</b> of Bloomington Conservation Project, Horch and the Master Institute of United Arts led {{an effort}} to improve {{deteriorated}} housing by converting single-family brownstone buildings into rent-subsidized apartments. Efforts like those of this project ameliorated conditions to some extent, but the Bloomingdale area {{did not return to}} prosperity until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the city as a whole experienced an economic rebound. As high-paying white-collar employment in financial institutions and other service industries replaced long-departed blue-collar jobs in the industrial sector, real estate speculators found that they could profit from new condos and co-ops either by replacing old buildings or by renovating them.|$|E
