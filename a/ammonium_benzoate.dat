50|$|Benzonitrile was {{reported}} by Hermann Fehling in 1844. He found the compound as a product from the thermal dehydration of <b>ammonium</b> <b>benzoate.</b> He deduced its structure from the already known analogue reaction of ammonium formate yielding formonitrile. He also coined the name benzonitrile which gave the name to all the group of nitriles.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{compound}} of the homolog row of nitriles, the nitrile of formic acid, hydrogen cyanide was first synthesized by C. W. Scheele in 1782. In 1811 J. L. Gay-Lussac {{was able to}} prepare the very toxic and volatile pure acid. The nitrile of benzoic acids was first prepared by Friedrich Wöhler and Justus von Liebig, but due to minimal yield of the synthesis neither physical nor chemical properties were determined nor a structure suggested. Théophile-Jules Pelouze synthesized propionitrile in 1834 suggesting {{it to be an}} ether of propionic alcohol and hydrocyanic acid.The synthesis of benzonitrile by Hermann Fehling in 1844, by heating <b>ammonium</b> <b>benzoate,</b> was the first method yielding enough of the substance for chemical research. He determined the structure by comparing his results to the already known synthesis of hydrogen cyanide by heating ammonium formate. He coined the name [...] "nitrile" [...] for the newfound substance, which became the name for this group of compounds.|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen, {{well advised}} by many scientists, as an {{ecofriendly}} and optimal {{fuel for the}} imminent future, were well oust in plentiful applications. Rhodopseudomonas species have shown an immense grade of morphological and structural analogy, however, they are phylogenetically quite diverse. Therefore, the present study for Hydrogen production affirms that the influence consortium of purple non sulphur bacteria isolated from Vishakapatnam marine water. The different parameters like various Carbon, Nitrogen, Growth factors and PH variation was identified for hydrogen production by the anoxygenic bacteria. The amount of hydrogen produced varies with various carbon, nitrogen, growth factors and PH used in the medium. The bacterial culture was cultured in 50 ml vessel within 30 ml of culture to produce hydrogen in anoxygenic conditions and incubated in 2000 lux light intensity for 196 hours. The best result for highest hydrogen productivity was 6 ml/ 30 ml of sodium <b>benzoate,</b> <b>ammonium</b> chloride, cyanocobalamine culture and at PH 7. 0, 7. 5 to purple non sulphur bacteria isolated from Vishakapatnam marine water...|$|R
40|$|Hierarchical {{structured}} {{tungsten oxide}} nanocrystals were synthesized via the hydrothermal route assisted by a capping agent of <b>ammonium</b> <b>benzoate</b> (AB). The products were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The experimental {{results show that}} the crystal microstructures could be changed from flower-shape to star-shape by changing the mole ratio of <b>ammonium</b> <b>benzoate</b> to sodium tungstate (AB/ST). The crystal phases were changed from orthorhombic WO 3 ⋅ 0. 33 H 2 O to hexagonal WO 3 with the increase in the concentration of AB. Based on the results from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and time-dependent growth analysis, a self-assembly growth mechanism has been proposed for the formation of flower, spherical, and star-netted microstructures at different mole ratios of the AB/ST. The star-netted WO 3 nanocrystals were applied as a sensitive layer for humidity sensing performed using a Love-mode ZnO/ 36 ∘ Y-cut LiTaO 3 surface acoustic wave device, and a stable and sensitive response to the change of relative humidity was obtained...|$|E
40|$|Molecular clips {{functionalized}} {{with two}} sodium or <b>ammonium</b> <b>benzoate</b> groups self-assemble in water {{by means of}} a hydrophobically driven dimerization reaction. Depending on the counter ions, this self-assembly stops at the stage of the dimer (sodium) or continues to generate large nanometer-sized aggregates (ammonium). The molecules in the latter aggregates are proposed to be 2 ̆ 7 glued 2 ̆ 7 together by multiple hydrogen bonds between the ammonium counter ions and the benzoate groups of the clips...|$|E
40|$|Syntheses of the bis-, tris- and tetra-tetrazolato calix[4]arene ligands were {{performed}} from their corresponding nitrile derivatives. Mono-nuclear lanthanoid complexes were characterised {{in the presence}} of triethylamine, while addition of aqueous ammonium acetate resulted in the formation of an unprecedented discrete linear nineteen lanthanoid hydroxo cluster (Ln 19). It was found the length of the cluster could be altered to an Ln 12 structure, while retaining an identical cluster motif, by simply replacing ammonium acetate with <b>ammonium</b> <b>benzoate...</b>|$|E
40|$|Benzoic {{acid and}} {{concentrated}} ammonia were chosen as reactants and a novel compound (<b>ammonium</b> <b>benzoate)</b> was synthesized {{using the method}} of liquid phase reaction. FTIR, elemental analysis and X-ray powder diffraction technique were applied to characterize the structure and composition of the compound. Low-temperature heat capacities of the solid compound were measured by a precision automated adiabatic calorimeter over the temperature range from 80 to 399 K. A polynomial equation of the heat capacities was fitted by the least-squares method. In accordance with Hess' law, a thermochemical cycle was designed, the enthalpy change of the reaction of benzoic acid with ammonium acetate was determined as Delta H-r(m) degrees = (15. 59 +/- 0. 50) kJ mol(- 1), and the standard molar enthalpy of formation of the compound was calculated as Delta H-f(m) degrees [C 7 H 5 O 2 NH 4,S] = -(472. 65 +/- 0. 62) kJ mol(- 1) by an isoperibol solution-reaction calorimeter.
