25|$|AGU co-published (along {{with the}} AMS and the AAG) its first {{electronic}} journal, Earth Interactions, in 1997. It started its own electronic journal, Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems, in December 1999. It made a full transition to electronic publishing in 2001. For all its journals, the electronic version became {{the publication of}} record. This {{was accompanied by a}} new identification scheme for articles that entirely did away with sequential page numbers. Instead, each article had a digital object identifier (DOI). As an example, 10.1029/2001GL014304 consists of the publisher identifier (AGU), the year (2001), the journal code (GL), and an <b>article</b> <b>number</b> (014304). This new system was met with complaints from libraries and scientists. The article numbers provided no clue for libraries to find an article in printed versions, and even scientific databases were not set up to handle DOIs. AGU officials claimed that the problems were a temporary cost of being a frontrunner, but did retroactively assign each article a four-digit <b>article</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
500|$|Einstein's {{scientific}} publications {{are listed}} below in four tables: journal articles, book chapters, books and authorized translations. [...] Each publication is {{indexed in the}} first column by its number in the Schilpp bibliography (Albert Einstein: Philosopher–Scientist, pp.694–730) and by its <b>article</b> <b>number</b> in Einstein's Collected Papers. [...] Complete references for these two bibliographies may be found below in the Bibliography section. [...] The Schilpp numbers are used for cross-referencing in the Notes (the final column of each table), since they cover a greater time period of Einstein's life at present. [...] The English translations of titles are generally taken from the published volumes of the Collected Papers. [...] For some publications, however, such official translations are not available; unofficial translations are indicated with a § superscript. Although the tables are presented in chronological order by default, each table can be re-arranged in alphabetical order for any column by the reader clicking on the arrows {{at the top of}} that column. [...] For illustration, to re-order a table by subject—e.g., to group together articles that pertain to [...] "General relativity" [...] or [...] "Specific heats"—one need only click on the arrows in the [...] "Classification and Notes" [...] columns. [...] To print out the re-sorted table, one may print it directly by using the web-browser Print option; the [...] "Printable version" [...] link at the left gives only the default sorting. [...] Collaborative works by Einstein are highlighted in lavender, with the co-author(s) provided in the final column of the table.|$|E

2500|$|As with CIA involvement, {{besides the}} normal serial number for each {{aircraft}} produced, each U-2 {{also has an}} [...] "article number" [...] assigned, and each U-2 would be referred to with its <b>article</b> <b>number</b> on classified internal documents. The prototype U-2, Article 341, never received a USAF serial. The first flight occurred at Groom Lake on 1 August 1955, during what {{was intended to be}} only a high-speed taxi test. The sailplane-like wings were so efficient that the aircraft jumped into the air at , amazing LeVier who, as he later said, [...] "had no intentions whatsoever of flying". The lake bed had no markings making it difficult for LeVier to judge the distance to the ground, and the brakes proved too weak; he bounced the U-2 once before it stopped rolling. Although the aircraft suffered only minor damage, LeVier again found landing the U-2 difficult during the actual first test flight three days later. On his sixth try, he found that landing the aircraft by touching down on the rear wheel first was superior to the front. Pilots continued to have difficulty during landing, due to the ground effect holding the aircraft off the runway for long distances. On a test flight on 8 August, the U-2 reached , proving that Johnson had met his promised specifications and deadline. By 16 August, the prototype flew at , an altitude never before reached in sustained flight; by 8 September, it reached [...]|$|E
