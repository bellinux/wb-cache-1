5|$|<b>Almost</b> <b>There</b> is {{the first}} major-label studio album by American Christian rock band MercyMe. Produced by Pete Kipley, the album was {{released}} on August 14, 2001 by INO Records. After releasing six independent records, the band decided to pursue a record contract due {{to the difficulty of}} selling, booking, and managing for themselves. The band signed with the newly formed INO Records, and were assigned to work with Kipley, who had not produced a major project before. Four of the songs on the album had previously appeared on the band's independent records; the rest were newly recorded songs. The album is a worship and pop rock album, and adopts a more radio-friendly sound than the band's independent albums.|$|E
5|$|MercyMe {{was formed}} in 1994 by vocalist Bart Millard, guitarist Mike Scheuchzer, and keyboardist Jim Bryson. The band later brought on drummer Robby Shaffer and bassist Nathan Cochran. In October 1999, the band {{released}} their fifth independent album, The Worship Project. The album proved successful, selling over 60,000 copies within a year, but the difficulty of selling albums directly, {{in addition to having}} to book and manage for themselves, led the band to pursue a contract with a record label. Millard was directed by a friend to contact Jeff Moseley, who had connections in the Christian music industry, for advice. After being contacted by Millard, Moseley expressed interest in the band, and within a week MercyMe was officially signed to INO Records, a new record label Moseley was helming. Moseley introduced the band to Pete Kipley, who would produce the album. Although Kipley had been involved on some minor projects, <b>Almost</b> <b>There</b> was his first major project.|$|E

25|$|Hook goes {{calling for}} Emma and {{stands on a}} rooftop to get attention. He jumps off, and Emma uses magic to take him safely to the ground, before asking {{why he was so}} sure she’d save him. He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could be as bad as what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is a sad story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and he says it was the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. He looks at the newspaper and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re <b>almost</b> <b>there</b> and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E
