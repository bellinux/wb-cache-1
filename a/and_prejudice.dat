From the 19th century, her family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels, and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations. The first dramatic adaptation of Austen was published in 1895, Rosina Filippi's Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen: Arranged and Adapted for Drawing-Room Performance, and Filippi was also responsible for the first professional stage adaptation, The Bennets (1901). The first film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of Pride <b>and</b> <b>Prejudice</b> starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson.

The British critic Robert Irvine noted that in American film adaptations of Austen's novels, starting with the 1940 version of Pride <b>and</b> <b>Prejudice</b> and continuing on to today, class is subtly downplayed as the United States is officially an egalitarian nation where all people are equal and the society of Regency England depicted by Austen that is grounded in a hierarchy based upon the ownership of land and the antiquity of the family name is one that Americans cannot embrace in its entirety.|$|E

The differences in both {{the endorsement of the}} foundations <b>and</b> the <b>prejudices</b> were larger among people with a liberal orientation than among those with a conservative orientation. Furthermore, the changes in endorsement of moral foundations among liberals explained their increases in prejudice.
