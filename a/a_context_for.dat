5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides <b>a</b> <b>context</b> <b>for</b> learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that the castle was built by one of the earls of Chester, partly because of the cost and partly because Cheshire was a palatine county and the earl had {{authority}} over who was permitted to build castles. The earls were involved in the civil war of King Stephen’s reign {{in the middle of the}} 12th century commonly known as the Anarchy and the revolt against Henry II in 117374, both of which may have prompted castle building. Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester wanted control of the earldom of Carlisle but during the Anarchy it and much of northern England come under Scottish control. The construction of Buckton Castle may have been to safeguard Cheshire. These civil wars and rebellions would also have provided <b>a</b> <b>context</b> <b>for</b> the deliberate destruction of the castle. Alternatively the castle could have been built by William de Neville when he held the lordship of Longdendale under the earl of Chester between 1181 and 1186, though he may not have had the financial means to do so.|$|E

25|$|As {{a part of}} the {{coalition}} set by Louis VII, William the Lion first invaded Northumberland in 1173 and then again in 1174, as a result he was captured near Alnwick and had to sign the tough Treaty of Falaise. Garrisons were to be set in the castles of Edinburgh, Roxburgh, Jedburgh and Berwick. Southern Scotland was from then under firm control just as Brittany was.

25|$|In {{reviving}} the television series after a sixteen-year hiatus (1989–2005), executive producer Russell T Davies was keen {{to provide a}} believable background for the Doctor's companion and <b>a</b> <b>context</b> <b>for</b> her travels {{to the past and}} future. The character of Jackie was created, along with Rose's on/off boyfriend Mickey, to keep the series grounded in reality. In writing Jackie, Davies incorporated both comic and tragic elements. Following the departure of the Tyler family, Davies was keen to bring Jackie back alongside Rose for future appearances. Reviewers generally reacted positively {{to the development of the}} character, though some identified unlikeable traits.|$|E
25|$|The {{television}} network was also criticized for allegedly biased coverage {{of events in}} the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, including the Bat Mitzvah massacre in 2002, where the network failed to note that the massacre victims were attending a bat mitzvah celebration for a 12-year-old girl, and neglected to mention that the gunman crashed the event at a crowded banquet hall. When the Palestinian militant Raed Karmi was killed by the Israeli army, Al Jazeera was criticized for failing to mention Israeli accusations about how many people he had killed, which would have provided <b>a</b> <b>context</b> <b>for</b> the story.|$|E
25|$|Astrobiology is an {{interdisciplinary}} field {{that uses a}} combination of geobiological and planetary science data to establish <b>a</b> <b>context</b> <b>for</b> the search for life on other planets. The origin of life from non-living chemistry and geology, or abiogenesis, is a major topic in astrobiology. Even though it is fundamentally an earth-bound concern, and therefore of great geobiological interest, getting at {{the origin of life}} necessitates considering what life requires, what, if anything, is special about Earth, what might have changed to allow life to blossom, what constitutes evidence for life, and even what constitutes life itself. These are the same questions that scientists might ask when searching for alien life. In addition, astrobiologists research the possibility of life based on other metabolisms and elements, the survivability of Earth’s organisms on other planets or spacecrafts, planetary and solar system evolution, and space geochemistry.|$|E

25|$|Language {{learning}} {{takes place}} in different contexts, with both the infant and the caregiver engaging in social interactions. Recent research have investigated how infants and adults use cross-situational statistics {{in order to learn}} about not only the meanings of words but also the constraints within <b>a</b> <b>context.</b> <b>For</b> example, Smith and his colleagues proposed that infants learn language by acquiring a bias to label objects to similar objects that come from categories that are well-defined. Important to this view is the idea that the constraints that assist learning of words are not independent of the input itself or the infant's experience. Rather, constraints come about as infants learn about the ways that the words are used and begin to pay attention to certain characteristics of objects that have been used in the past to represent the words.|$|E
25|$|Political, {{economic}} and artistic shifts provided <b>a</b> <b>context</b> <b>for</b> the early manifestations of expressionist architecture; particularly in Germany, where the utopian qualities of expressionism found strong resonances with a leftist artistic community keen to provide answers to {{a society in}} turmoil {{during and after the}} events of World War I. The loss of the war, the subsequent removal of Kaiser Wilhelm II, the depravations and the rise of social democracy and the optimism of the Weimar republic created a reluctance amongst architects to pursue projects initiated before the war and provided the impetus to seek new solutions. An influential body of the artistic community, including architects, sought a similar revolution as had occurred in Russia. The costly and grandiose remodelling of the Grosses Schauspielhaus, was more reminiscent of the imperial past, than wartime budgeting and post-war depression.|$|E
25|$|In Berlin, Italian restorers {{reassembled}} {{the panels}} comprising the frieze from {{the thousands of}} fragments that had been recovered. In order to display the result and create <b>a</b> <b>context</b> <b>for</b> it, a new museum was erected in 1901 on Berlin's Museum Island. Because this first Pergamon Museum proved to be both inadequate and structurally unsound, it was demolished in 1909 and replaced with a much larger museum, which opened in 1930. This new museum is still {{open to the public}} on the island. Despite the fact that the new museum was home to a variety of collections beyond the friezes (for example, a famous reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate of ancient Babylon), the city's inhabitants decided to name it the Pergamon Museum for the friezes and reconstruction of the west front of the altar. The Pergamon Altar is today the most famous item in the Berlin Collection of Classical Antiquities, which is on display in the Pergamon Museum and in the Altes Museum, both of which are on Berlin's Museum Island.|$|E
