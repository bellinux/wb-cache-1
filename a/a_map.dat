5|$|Yuan Hsieh (d. +1220) was Director-General of {{governmental}} grain stores. In pursuance of his schemes for {{the relief of}} famines he issued orders that each pao (village) should prepare <b>a</b> <b>map</b> which would show the fields and mountains, the rivers and the roads in fullest detail. The maps of all the pao were joined together to make <b>a</b> <b>map</b> of the tu (larger district), and these in turn were joined with others to make <b>a</b> <b>map</b> of the hsiang and the hsien (still larger districts). If there was any trouble about the collection of taxes or the distribution of grain, or if the question of chasing robbers and bandits arose, the provincial officials could readily carry out their duties by {{the aid of the}} maps.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} artwork is {{displayed}} on {{the exterior of the}} building. Sculptor Leo Friedlander used Vermont marble for the large relief sculptures {{on both sides of the}} main entrance.

Additionally, Ellerhusen created five marble relief sculptures on the exterior, and a metal sculpture by Tom Morandi sits above the south entrance. Ellerhusen also cast six bronze sculptures arranged above the building's main entrance, three on the inside and three on the outside.|$|E

Al-Idrisi (1100–1166) created <b>a</b> <b>map</b> of the world for Roger, the Norman King of Sicily. He also wrote the Book of Roger, a geographic study of the peoples, climates, resources and industries of the whole of the world known at that time. The Ottoman admiral Piri Reis (c. 1470–1553) made <b>a</b> <b>map</b> of the New World and West Africa in 1513. He made use of maps from Greece, Portugal, Muslim sources, and perhaps one made by Christopher Columbus. He was part of a major tradition of Ottoman cartography.|$|E
5|$|Although {{players had}} {{previously}} recorded segments of gameplay, these were usually deathmatches or speedruns, attempts to complete <b>a</b> <b>map</b> {{as quickly as}} possible. Diary of a Camper was the first demo to contain a narrative with text-based dialogue, instead of merely showing gameplay. Commentators have called the work primitive, but acknowledge its importance in establishing video games as a medium for filmmaking.|$|E
