5|$|Thulium-170 {{is gaining}} {{popularity}} as <b>an</b> <b>X-ray</b> source for cancer treatment via brachytherapy. This isotope has a half-life of 128.6 days and five major emission lines of comparable intensity (at 7.4, 51.354, 52.389, 59.4 and 84.253keV). Thulium-170 {{is one of}} the four most popular radioisotopes for use in industrial radiography.|$|E
5|$|To {{diagnose}} osteochondritis dissecans, <b>an</b> <b>X-ray,</b> CT scan or MRI scan can {{be performed}} to show necrosis of subchondral bone, formation of loose fragments, or both. Occasionally a nuclear medicine bone scan is {{used to assess the}} degree of loosening within the joint.|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the x-ray powder {{diffraction}} patterns of rapidly quenched MnAl 6 and Mg 32 (Al,Zn) 49 and the neutron powder diffraction pattern of MnAl 6 are compatible with the proposed 820 -atom primitive cubic structure [Pauling, L. (1987) Phys. Rev. Lett. 58, 365 - 368]. The values found for {{the edge of the}} unit cube are 23. 365 <b>Å</b> (<b>x-ray)</b> and 23. 416 Å (neutron) for MnAl 6 and 24. 313 <b>Å</b> (<b>x-ray)</b> for Mg 32 (Al,Zn) 49...|$|R
5|$|After World War I, Harrison {{traveled}} the Middle East performing medical duties such as treating prostitutes afflicted with venereal disease in Constantinople and operating <b>an</b> <b>X-ray</b> facility in Lod, Israel. Although still not legally divorced {{from his first}} two wives, Harrison married Filomena Abela, a Maltese woman at Alexandria in 1920. However, the newlyweds could not find escape from the adventure that had followed Harrison all his life. Harrison and his new wife's train was ambushed by a band of Syrians disillusioned {{with a group of}} politicians. The quick thinking of the recently thrice-married physician prevented his new wife's broken leg from developing into gangrene.|$|E
5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in <b>an</b> <b>X-ray,</b> it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>X-ray</b> of {{swallowed}} barium {{may be used}} {{to reveal}} {{the size and shape of}} the esophagus, and the presence of any masses. The esophagus may also be imaged using a flexible camera inserted into the esophagus, in a procedure called an endoscopy. If an endoscopy is used on the stomach, the camera will also have to pass through the esophagus. During an endoscopy, a biopsy may be taken. If cancer of the esophagus is being investigated, other methods, including a CT scan, may also be used.|$|E

5|$|As {{described}} in the mathematical derivation below, the X-ray scattering {{is determined by the}} density of electrons within the crystal. Since the energy of <b>an</b> <b>X-ray</b> is much greater than that of a valence electron, the scattering may be modeled as Thomson scattering, the interaction of an electromagnetic ray with a free electron. This model is generally adopted to describe the polarization of the scattered radiation.|$|E
5|$|Circinus X-1 is <b>an</b> <b>X-ray</b> {{binary star}} system that {{includes}} a neutron star. Observations of Circinus X-1 in July 2007 revealed the presence of X-ray jets normally found in black hole systems. Located at 19,000light-years, the pulsar PSR B1509-58, also called the Circinus Pulsar, has expelled a 20-light-year-long jet of material from its southern pole, clearly visible in the X-ray spectrum. Another supernova remnant in Circinus is that of SN 185. Recorded by Chinese observers in 185 AD, SN 185 was visible {{in the night sky}} for around eight months; its remnants, known as RCW 86, cover an area larger than the typical full moon.|$|E
5|$|Fine needle {{aspiration}} (FNA) {{can be used}} to biopsy bone lesions, {{once found}} on <b>an</b> <b>X-ray</b> or other scan. Such tests can be vital in diagnosis and can also prevent unnecessary treatment and invasive surgery. Conversely, FNA biopsy of tumors of the parathyroid gland is not recommended for diagnosing parathyroid carcinoma and may in fact be harmful, as the needle can puncture the tumor, leading to dissemination and the possible spread of cancerous cells.|$|E

5|$|GRO J0422+32 (V518 Persei) {{is another}} X-ray binary in Perseus. One {{component}} {{is a red}} dwarf star of spectral type M4.5V, which orbits a mysterious dense and heavy object—possibly a black hole—every 5.1 hours. The system is <b>an</b> <b>X-ray</b> nova, meaning that it experiences periodic outbursts in the X-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum. If the system does indeed contain a black hole, {{it would be the}} smallest one ever recorded. Further analysis in 2012 calculated a mass of 2.1 solar masses, which raises questions as to what the object actually is as it appears to be too small to be a black hole.|$|E

The Palestinian Ministry of Health runs a childcare center and medical lab in the town, while an additional health center and <b>an</b> <b>x-ray</b> center {{are run by}} a charitable society. In addition, there are five pharmacies in Bani Na'im. In 2009, the town had one ambulance. Residents travel to Hebron for emergency treatment.|$|E

40|$|<b>X-ray</b> {{observations}} suggest <b>a</b> broad {{division between}} clusters having <b>a</b> centrally-located, <b>X-ray</b> dominant galaxy characterized by <b>a</b> centrally-peaked <b>X-ray</b> emission, and clusters with <b>a</b> broader <b>X-ray</b> profile. Within these categories, such evolutionary indicators as X-ray temperature, vorticity dispersion, spiral fraction and central galaxy density may indicate the relative stages of evolution. X-ray imaging observations are presented for (1) the Virgo cluster, (2) other dynamically unevolved clusters, (3) double clusters {{which may be}} in an intermediate evolutionary stage, and (4) dynamically evolved clusters. The data are analyzed under the assumption of <b>an</b> isothermal <b>X-ray</b> gas which is gravitationally bound by galaxies and clusters...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} design, fabrication, {{assembly}} {{and testing of}} <b>a</b> <b>x-ray</b> detector based on a bulk micromachined photodiode (BMMPD) with a cavity filled with a scintillating crystal. The x-ray photons that reach the detector are first converted to visible light by the scintillating crystal. The visible light is then detected by the BMMPD, producing an electric current whose value {{is proportional to the}} incident x-ray intensity. The tests are done using <b>a</b> <b>x-ray</b> tube powered with a voltage of 35 kV, and a current ranging from 0 mA to 1 mA. With this setup, very promising results were obtained...|$|R

5|$|Shown {{right is}} <b>an</b> <b>X-ray</b> {{structure}} showing a complex between a diaminocarbene and potassium HMDS. This complex was formed when excess KHMDS {{was used as}} a strong base to deprotonate the formamidinium salt. Removing lithium ions resulting from deprotonation with reagents such as LDA can be especially problematic. Potassium and sodium salt by-products tend to precipitate from solution and can be removed. Lithium ions may be chemically removed by binding to species such as cryptands or crown ethers.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} Sutcliffe's {{aneurysm}} is unknown, {{although it is}} believed to have been started by an earlier head injury, as he was either kicked in the head, or thrown, head first, against a brick wall during a fight outside Lathom Hall, after a performance in January 1961. According to former manager Allan Williams, Lennon and Best went to Sutcliffe's aid, fighting off his attackers before dragging him to safety. Sutcliffe sustained a fractured skull in the fight and Lennon's little finger was broken. Sutcliffe refused medical attention at the time and failed to keep <b>an</b> <b>X-ray</b> appointment at Sefton General Hospital.|$|E

50|$|For example, <b>a</b> copper <b>X-ray</b> source may {{preferentially}} produce <b>a</b> beam of <b>x-rays</b> with wavelengths 154 and 139 picometres.
