25|$|Scientists {{who study}} {{perception}} and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations. Depth perception consists of processing {{over half a}} dozen visual cues, {{each of which is}} based on a regularity of the physical world. Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not pass through objects. Sound waves go around corners and interact with obstacles, creating a complex pattern that includes useful information about the sources of and distances to objects. Larger animals naturally make lower-pitched sounds as a consequence of their size. The range over which an animal hears, on the other hand, is determined by adaptation. Homing pigeons, for example, can hear very low-pitched sound (infrasound) that carries great distances, even though most smaller animals detect higher-pitched sounds. Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that are thought to have been significant for fitness in the EEA. For example, salt and sugar were apparently both valuable to the human or pre-human inhabitants of the EEA, so present day humans have an intrinsic hunger for salty and sweet tastes. The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain. Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive. An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation. For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light. Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, {{as is the case with}} the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.|$|E

500|$|The rivalry {{continued}} into the new millennium, though Manchester United's domestic grip tightened. They finished 18 points clear of Arsenal in 1999–2000 and completed a hat-trick of titles the following season. Any indication United could be caught faded once Ferguson's team resoundingly beat Arsenal 6–1 in February 2001. Dwight Yorke scored a hat-trick, on a day Wenger fielded a relatively inexperienced centre-back pairing of Gilles Grimandi and Igors Stepanovs. At {{the end of the}} campaign, Ferguson announced his decision to retire. He reportedly sanctioned a bid to sign midfielder Patrick Vieira, who was upset at Arsenal's transfer inactivity. The transfer never came through; Wenger blamed his rivals for [...] "...approach to Patrick without contacting us, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not really respect the rules." [...] United made an indifferent start to the league campaign, and by February 2002, Ferguson went back on his retirement plan on the advice of his family. Arsenal hit their stride as the 2001–02 season came to a close, winning the double {{for the second time in}} four years. The championship was decided at Old Trafford in the penultimate game of the season; Wenger described his team's 1–0 win as a [...] "shift of power." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Frankfurt School's work {{cannot be}} {{addressed}} without understanding {{the objectives of}} critical theory.

The original aim of critical theory was to analyze the true significance of [...] "the ruling understandings" [...] generated in bourgeois society, in order to show how they misrepresented actual human interaction in the real world, and in so doing functioned to justify or legitimize the domination of people by capitalism. A certain sort of story (a narrative) was provided to explain what was happening in society, but the story concealed as much as it revealed. The Frankfurt theorists generally assumed that their task was mainly to interpret the areas of society Marx had not dealt with, especially in the superstructure of society.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1980s, {{passive solar}} {{building}} design and passive house have demonstrated heating energy consumption reductions of 70% to 90% in many locations, without active energy harvesting. For new builds, and with expert design, {{this can be}} accomplished with little additional construction cost for materials over a conventional building. Very few industry experts have the skills or experience to fully capture benefits of the passive design. Such passive solar designs are much more cost-effective than adding expensive photovoltaic panels on the roof of a conventional inefficient building. A few kilowatt-hours of photovoltaic panels (costing 2 to 3 dollars per annual kWh production, U.S. dollar equivalent) may only reduce external energy requirements by 15% to 30%.
