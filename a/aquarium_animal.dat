40|$|The {{freshwater}} crayfish Austropotamobius torrentium {{collected in the}} Netherlands in 1956 (Crustacea: Decapoda: Astacidae) On 10 November 1956 a {{freshwater crayfish}} was collected in a fish trap in the canal that surrounds the polder Haarlemmermeer between Haarlem and Amsterdam about 2 to 3 km from the village Halfweg. The specimen is a fully grown male of 106 mm in total length; the left first cheliped is missing and the right first cheliped evidently has been lost previously, as a small regenerated cheliped (total length of cheliped 40 mm, length of chela 16 mm) is present. At that time Astacus astacus was the only freshwater crayfish in the Netherlands and the specimen was (incorrectly) identified as that species. As such it was also reported in Geelen’s (1978) discussion of the then known occurrence of freshwater crayfish in the Netherlands. The locality of the specimen was far outside the known Dutch region of occurrence of A. astacus. A recent re-examination of the specimen showed it not to be Astacus astacus, but Austropotamobius torrentium, which made the mystery of its locality only greater. Austropotamobius species have never been found {{in or near the}} Netherlands. Moreover, the habitat in which our specimen was found is so completely different from that in which that species usually lives, that its occurrence near Halfweg can only be artificial. How the specimen arrived there will always remain a puzzle. As the species is not a common <b>aquarium</b> <b>animal,</b> the aquarium trade {{is not likely to be}} the culprit...|$|E
40|$|The large {{gastropod}} queen conch, Strombus gigas, is {{a valuable}} food source throughout the Caribbean and the Florida region. The markets for S. gigas are adult meat for chowders and fritters, and shells for decoration. Excessive over-fishing of S. gigas has led to its listing on Appendix II of CITES and mandated a statewide fishing moratorium in the Florida waters. To help preserve the species, biologists are successfully culturing queen conch from egg stage to market. However, the cycle is not closed. Egg masses are collected from reproductively active adult populations in the field. This means that the aquaculturist is heavily reliant upon spawning aggregations for continued culturing success of this threatened species. In response {{to the need for}} specimens for aquaculture, we began a captive breeding program for Strombus species in June 2000 at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, Ft. Pierce, Florida. A breeding arena was built in a large round tank (4. 5 m dia x 0. 9 m height). The tank was divided into 4 equivalent sections (4. 1 m^ 2) and filled with water to 0. 42 m above the substrate. This recirculating tank system is equipped with an undergravel filter system, comprised of coarse Bahamian aragonite sand (1 - 3 mm) at a depth of 10 cm. The tank was located in a greenhouse structure, allowing for natural photoperiod during our experiment. The mean water temperature was 27 °C and salinity 34 ppt. There are seven species of Strombus in the Caribbean and Florida region. We chose 3 non-restricted species (Strombus costatus, milk conch; Strombus raninus, hawkwing; and Strombus alatus; Florida fighting conch) as well as S. gigas to begin our breeding program. These smaller, less threatened Strombus may also prove to be a premium food item and a successful <b>aquarium</b> <b>animal.</b> A total of 24 adult conch were collected: five S. costatus (3 female, 2 male), seven S. raninus (5 females, 2 males), eight S. alatus (4 females, 4 males), and four S. gigas (1 female, 3 males) from the Florida Keys and placed into their respective quadrants on June 16 and July 16 (for S. gigas). The number of copulating pairs and spawning females were noted on a daily basis for the first 49 days (7 weeks). Collected egg masses were measured for size, number of eggs, and egg capsule and strand diameter. In 36 weeks we collected 401 egg masses. S. raninus began breeding on day 2 and continued to breed persistently through early November. S. raninus laid 336 egg masses. We also had success with S. alatus, 44 egg masses; S. costatus laid a total of 19 egg masses, {{and we were able to}} get S. gigas to lay two egg masses in mid-February. The viability of the eggs was confirmed as we successfully hatched several egg masses from all four species and raised them through juvenile stage. Based on breeding success of these species we hope to establish the commercial ability of a captive breeding program, and establish alternative aquarium and juvenile queen conch market. </p...|$|E

40|$|Increased pressure, {{associated}} with diving, can alter cell function {{through several mechanisms}} and {{has been shown to}} impact immune functions performed by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in humans. While marine mammals possess specific adaptations which protect them from dive related injury, it is unknown how their immune system is adapted to the challenges {{associated with}} diving. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure PBMC activation (IL 2 R expression) and Concanavalin A induced lymphocyte proliferation (BrdU incorporation) in belugas following in vitro pressure exposures during baseline, Out of Water Examination (OWE) and capture/release conditions. Beluga blood samples (n= 4) were obtained from animals at the Mystic Aquarium and from free ranging animals in Alaska (n= 9). Human blood samples (n= 4) (Biological Specialty Corporation) were run for comparison. In vivo catecholamines and cortisol were measured in belugas to characterize the neuroendocrine response. Comparison of cellular responses between controls and pressure exposed cells, between conditions in belugas, between belugas and humans as well as between dive profiles, were run using mixed generalized linear models (α= 0. 05). Cortisol was significantly higher in wild belugas and OWE samples as compared with baseline for <b>aquarium</b> <b>animals.</b> Both IL 2 R expression and proliferation displayed significant pressure induced changes, and these responses varied between conditions in belugas. Both belugas and humans displayed increased IL 2 R expression, while lymphocyte proliferation decreased for <b>aquarium</b> <b>animals</b> and increased for humans and wild belugas. Results suggest beluga PBMC function is altered during diving and changes may represent dive adaptation as the response differs from humans, a non-dive adapted mammal. In addition, characteristics of a dive (i. e., duration, depth) as well as neuroendocrine activity can alter the response of beluga cells, potentially impacting the ability of animals to fight infection or avoid dive related pathologies...|$|R

40|$|The {{import of}} <b>aquarium</b> <b>animals</b> has been {{increasing}} worldwide in recent years. Despite its contribution to world trade and the economy, this trade also comprises {{one of the main}} pathways for the introduction of non-indigenous animals. In the past decade, crayfish has become a popular pet as well as a potential threat to the environment upon its escape or release. Since the Czech Republic is one of the world’s leading importer, exporter, and producer of aquatic ornamental animals, we prepared a detailed analysis of crayfish imports. The present paper provides a complete list of countries supplying ornamental crayfish and examines trends of their prices and imported quantities during the past decade (2003 – 2012). Indonesia has been identified as the leading supplier in recent years. The annual average price of imported crayfish has varied over the evaluated period within the range of € 0. 76 – 4. 72 per individual and it is rising annually by € 0. 15. The quantity of live crayfish imported for aquarium purposes has not been affected significantly by the price per individual and it has grown rapidly. Therefore a constant monitoring of this pet trade sector is strongly recommended for the future...|$|R

40|$|Disinfection is {{commonly}} employed in recirculating mariculture systems (RMS) to control animal diseases and improve seawater quality; however, {{little is known}} about the occurrence of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formed in such RMS. Beijing Aquarium is a typical RMS with artificially prepared seawater and mainly adopts a decentralized treatment strategy for different animal tanks, including sand filtration, foam fractionation, and disinfection (O- 3, UV, and O- 3 /ClO 2). This study reveals that the adopted disinfection processes were highly effective in controlling marine heterotrophic bacteria; however, some concerns were raised on the formation of various kinds of DBPs, including secondary oxidants, inorganic oxyanions, and hazardous organic species. Free chlorine and free bromine were generated from ozonation at health-relevant concentrations. High concentrations of BrO 3 - and ClO 3 - were formed in mammal tanks, which exceeded the USEPA-regulated maximum contaminant level (MCL) for drinking water by 19 - 25 and 52 - 54 times, respectively. Extremely high concentrations of NO 3 -were detected in mammal tanks, which considerably exceeded the MCL regulated by the Sea Water Quality Standard of China for the mariculture industry (Class II) by about 1100 times. Undoubtedly, the presence of various DBPs poses serious health threats to <b>aquarium</b> <b>animals.</b> To solve these problems, potential control measures for DBPs are proposed...|$|R
