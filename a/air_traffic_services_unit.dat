50|$|The Future Air Navigation System (FANS) is an {{avionics}} system which provides direct data link {{communication between the}} pilot and the air traffic controller. The communications include air traffic control clearances, pilot requests and position reporting. In the FANS-B equipped Airbus A320 family aircraft, an <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Unit</b> (ATSU) and a VHF Data Link radio (VDR3) in the avionics rack and two data link control and display units (DCDUs) in the cockpit enable the flight crew to read and answer the controller-pilot data link communications (CPDLC) messages received from the ground.|$|E

50|$|A pilot report or PIREP is {{a report}} of actual weather {{conditions}} encountered by an aircraft in flight. This information is usually relayed by radio to the nearest ground station, but other options (e.g. electronic submission) also exist in some regions. The message would then be encoded and relayed to other weather offices and <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>service</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
50|$|The CPDLC {{application}} provides air-ground {{data communication}} for the ATC service. This includes {{a set of}} clearance/information/request message elements which correspond to voice phraseology employed by <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control procedures. The controller is provided with the capability to issue level assignments, crossing constraints, lateral deviations, route changes and clearances, speed assignments, radio frequency assignments, and various requests for information. The pilot is provided with the capability to respond to messages, to request clearances and information, to report information, and to declare/rescind an emergency. The pilot is, in addition, provided with the capability to request conditional clearances (downstream) and information from a downstream <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>service</b> <b>unit</b> (ATSU). A “free text” capability is also provided to exchange information not conforming to defined formats. An auxiliary capability is provided to allow a ground system to use data link to forward a CPDLC message to another ground system.|$|R
40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> {{controllers}} {{are responsible}} for navigating aircraft and sustaining a safe and efficient traffic flow in a four-dimensional air space. They apply separation rules to keep aircraft apart {{from each other and}} their wellcoordinated work and complete awareness of risks have made possible the combination of increased traffic intensity and strong safety records. Rules and procedures make up {{a significant part of the}} work and the locus of this study was to examine how the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers, employed at the Swedish state enterprise LFV, perceive their current set of regulations. At each <b>Traffic</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Unit</b> operators are equipped with two operations manuals, and a particular focus was put on the design, use and management of the manuals. Furthermore, this study involved two observation sessions in two <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Units</b> and twelve interviews with operators and domain experts. With the aid of the theory of Resilience Engineering, four essential functions have been identified in order to account for the underlying and interconnected functions behind rule implementation: monitoring, learning, anticipation and responding. Thereafter, each function has been divided into sub-categories that all are aimed to describe in what ways, individual as organizational, current rule management supports the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that there is need for a reorganization of the set of regulations at LFV, and that the maintenance of the operations manuals has been reduced because of constrained resources. An additional factor, which complicates the possibility to change the procedures, is that a major part of the content originates from international regulations. In addition, this thesis claims that safe and successful use of rules depends on more than the physical look and design of the operations manuals. Therefore, support of current set of regulations will be discussed in terms of document distribution, education, communication, purpose of procedures and approaches to rulefollowing...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we examine the}} issue {{regarding}} pricing of radar data and surveillance to the operators of air navigation service (ANS) at the aerodromes in Sweden. The question of who should be responsible for providing radar data to the operators is being managed that results in if it should be LFV, as it is today, the government or another authority. This is being examined since LFV in 2010 lost its monopoly position in the terminal area in Sweden. LFV still has monopoly on the en route part, and thru the en route income finances the radar data to all operators in Sweden. <b>Air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>service</b> <b>units</b> (ATS) receive the radar data without any compensation to LFV, {{this needs to be}} regulated and conditions and prerequisites are necessary to be implemented. Our supervisor at LFV, Anders Andersson, has been the primary source of information regarding the current situation, background for the problem and also provided relevant documents with proper information. Laws and regulations have been accessed via the Swedish Transport Agency’s website and scientific articles on monopolies and pricing in aviation and other markets have been used in order to compare earlier issues similar to ours. The literature studies combined with interviews with Anders Andersson are the foundations of the development of the pricing schemes. The result of the thesis is presented as three different pricing schemes where each one of them are presented in tables and analysed how it will affect the ATS. In the first pricing scheme the cost for maintenance is equally divided between all ATS, this means every ATS has to pay the same cost regardless size of the airport, number of movement and net sales. The second pricing scheme is based on number of landings per year and divides the ATS in three categories. This scheme increases the cost with concern to the number of landings, which results in the larger ATS are charged more than the smaller ATS. The final pricing scheme is divided in four categories and based on terminal control area (TMA) and requirements on surveillance service. This means the different categories are based on a combination of the median distance flown in TMA and the different requirements the ATS must provide surveillance service. This pricing scheme is a disadvantage for the military airports and the ATS with associated TMA. The conclusions that can be made are the Swedish Transport Agency needs to implement some distinct guidelines and regulations regarding how the pricing should be made, where the pricing schemes and analysis in this thesis could form the basis for future investigations...|$|R

40|$|The <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control {{industry}} in Europe is under mounting pressure due to increasing <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> and inefficient routines {{caused by a}} fragmented air space. In order to handle the demands the European Commission has launched a program entitled the Single European Sky initiative which seeks to promote a more efficient way of handling the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> over Europe. A reorganization of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> management will be introduced during this process and <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control centers in Europe will be merged. New tech-nology will further be implemented and the air space will be rationalized. In this context the Swedish <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control provider is an interesting case since an adaptation to increasing <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> and the Single European Sky initiative has already begun through {{the introduction of new}} organizational structures and new technology. As psycho-organizational aspects can be identified as affecting safety out-comes in high risk organizations with highly reliable operations, the overall aim of the research presented in this thesis was to study different psycho-organizational aspects in Swedish <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control during times of change. The studies on which this thesis is based focused on: innovative organizational climate, examining the innovative preparedness and capacity to cope with changes in a highly regulated organizational environment; situational leader-ship, examining leadership characteristics in a high risk organization with a well developed safety culture; psychosocial work environment, examining critical psychosocial environmental factors in a high risk organization with de-manding work operations; and safety culture, examining perceptions of safety culture as well as the relationships between safety culture aspects and or-ganizational climate dimensions. All in all, five studies were conducted of which four were empirical. The empirical studies were all conducted at two <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control centers and an administrative <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>services</b> (ANS) <b>unit</b> which was part of the LFV Group Swedish Airports and Air Navigation Services. The three study loca-tions employed 635 <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers and other staff members. The or-ganizational climate was measured with the Creative Climate Questionnaire (CCQ) (Ekvall, 1990), the situational leadership with the Leader Effectiveness and Adaptability Description (LEAD) (Hersey & Blanchard, 1988; Holmkvist, 2000), the psychosocial work environment with the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ) (Kristensen, Hannerz, Høgh & Borg, 2005), and the safety culture with the safety culture assessment questionnaire devel-oped by Ek (2006). Study I concluded that the existing empirical research concerning relation-ships between organizational climate, leadership and safety culture or safety climate is limited. Previous research supports the assumption that safety culture is related to other psycho-organizational aspects, but the knowledge base is still too limited to be conclusive. The ambiguity in defining and op-erationalizing the concepts is an additional weakness in the field. It was further assumed that the innovative organizational climate would be under-developed in <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control due to the strict regulatory framework which is present in this environment. The results from Study II revealed, however, that the innovative organizational climate was quite positive in spite of the rule governed work. Differences in the assessment of the inno-vative organizational climate could be identified according to work charac-teristics and work tasks but not according to organizational position. Study III concluded that the situational leadership characteristics differed according to situation. The leadership behavior was more relationship-oriented in Success and Group situations compared with Hardship and Individual situations. The leadership adaptability ? the leader's ability to adjust leader-ship style according to the situation ? was superior in Success and Individual situations than in Hardship and Group situations. Operational conditions, lead-ership structures and working tasks were, on the other hand, not associated with leadership behavior. Three aspects of the psychosocial work environment were identified as dif-ficult in <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control in Study IV. In an otherwise positive assessment, Sensorial demands, Freedom and Feedback were challenging aspects. These as-pects seemed to be characteristic for operative <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control work since the operative personnel assessed them to be statistically significantly less positive than did the administrative personnel. Organizational position was also found to be influential in the assessment of psychosocial work envi-ronmental factors since the management group made more positive as-sessments on a number of dimensions. The effect of differences in opera-tional conditions was, however, limited. The safety culture was positively assessed in the Swedish <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control context according to Study V. The administrative ANS unit had generally somewhat lower scores than the two operative <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control centers. Overall, Communication, Justness and Flexibility received slightly lower scores {{than the rest of the}} safety culture aspects. The results further demonstrated that the two organizational climate dimensions, Support for ideas and Conflicts, were positively and most frequently related to the various safety culture as-pects at the two <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control centers. However, few relationships were found between the safety culture and organizational climate concepts at the administrative ANS unit. Because of the limited knowledge concerning the influence of organiza-tional aspects on safety and their possible relationships with safety culture and safety climate, more research in this area is desired, especially in the field of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control. Due to differences in national conditions and culture as well as local variations, studies similar to those conducted in Sweden are also needed in other European countries in order to make the transition to the Single European Sky as smooth, safe and efficient as pos-sible...|$|R
