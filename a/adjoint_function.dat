40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{application}} of the adjoint transport theory in order to optimize Monte Carlo based radiotherapy treatment planning. The technique is applied to Boron Neutron Capture Therapy where most often mixed beams of neutrons and gammas are involved. In normal forward Monte Carlo simulations the particles start at a source and lose energy as they travel towards the region of interest, i. e. the designated point of detection. Conversely, with adjoint Monte Carlo simulations, the so-called adjoint particles start at the region of interest and gain energy as they travel towards the source where they are detected. In this respect, the particles travel backwards and the real source and real detector become the adjoint detector and adjoint source, respectively. At the adjoint detector, an <b>adjoint</b> <b>function</b> is obtained with which numerically the same result, e. g. dose or flux in the tumor, can be derived as with forward Monte Carlo. In many cases, the adjoint method is more efficient and by that is much quicker when, for example, the response in the tumor or organ at risk for many locations and orientations of the treatment beam around the patient is required. However, a problem occurs when the treatment beam is mono-directional as the probability of detecting adjoint Monte Carlo particles traversing the beam exit (detector plane in adjoint mode) in the negative direction of the incident beam is zero. This problem is addressed here and solved first with the use of next event estimators and second with the application of a Legendre expansion technique of the angular <b>adjoint</b> <b>function.</b> In the first approach, adjoint particles are tracked deterministically through a tube to a (adjoint) point detector far away from the geometric model. The adjoint particles will traverse the disk shaped entrance of this tube (the beam exit in the actual geometry) perpendicularly. This method is slow whenever many events are involved that are not contributing to the point detector, e. g. neutrons in a scattering medium. In the second approach, adjoint particles that traverse an adjoint shaped detector plane are used to estimate the Legendre coefficients for expansion of the angular <b>adjoint</b> <b>function.</b> This provides an estimate of the <b>adjoint</b> <b>function</b> for the direction normal to the detector plane. In a realistic head model, as described in this paper, which is surrounded by 1020 mono-directional neutron/gamma beams and from which the best ones are to be selected, the example calculates the neutron and gamma fluxes in 10 tumors and 10 organs at risk. For small diameter beams (5 cm), and with comparable relative errors, forward Monte Carlo is seen to be 1. 5 times faster than the adjoint Monte Carlo techniques. For larger diameter neutron beams (10 cm and 15 cm), the Legendre technique is found to be 6 and 20 times faster, respectively. In the case of gammas alone, for the 10 cm and 15 cm diameter beams, both adjoint Monte Carlo Legendre and point detector techniques are respectively 2 and 3 times faster than forward Monte Carlo.

Besides ill-posedness, the estimation process {{is influenced by the}} instrumental errors in the measured concentrations and model representativity errors. The study highlights the effect of minimizing model representativity errors on the source estimation. This is described in an adjoint modelling framework and followed in three steps. First, an estimation of point source parameters (location and intensity) is carried out using an inversion technique. Second, a linear regression relationship is established between the measured concentrations and corresponding predicted using the retrieved source parameters. Third, this relationship is utilized to modify the <b>adjoint</b> <b>functions.</b> Further, source estimation is carried out using these modified <b>adjoint</b> <b>functions</b> to analyse the effect of such modifications.

The first uses one-group theory and data that correspond to a traditional uranium fuelled light water reactor to investigate the basis physical differences that might arise due solely to {{the movement of the}} fuel.

For both systems, the Green's functions and the dynamic <b>adjoint</b> <b>functions</b> are investigated in the general case of arbitrary fuel recirculation velocity and in the limiting case of infinite fuel velocity which permits closed form solutions both in the static and dynamic case. It is found that the amplitude of the induced noise is generally higher and the domain of the point kinetic behaviour valid up to higher frequencies than in a corresponding traditional system. This is due to the differing behaviour of the delayed neutron precursors as compared to the traditional case.

40|$|A new {{importance}} estimation method, {{which is}} based on the <b>adjoint</b> <b>function</b> definition, has been proposed especially for the weight window (WW) technique of MCNP, which is well {{known as one of the}} most powerful variance-reduction techniques in Monte Carlo codes.

Every scattering point has an adjoint contribution to the detector, with which a space-, energy-, and angle-dependent importance for WW could be estimated. From the numerical test calculations, the basic performance was confirmed to be better than WWG by comparing figure-of-merit values. It would be expected that the performance of WWG would be well improved by using the present method instead of the current MCNP routine of accumulating the detector contribution for the F 5 tally.

Planning Production, Inventories, and Work Force. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.), especially for its application to a paint factory. A discrete control version of a related quadratic production-inventory model was studied by Kleindorfer, Kriebel, Thompson, and Kleindorfer in (Kleindorfer, P. R., C. H. Kriebel, G. L. Thompson, G. B. Kleindorfer. 1975. Discrete optimal control of production plans. Management Sci. 22 261 [...] 273.). In the present paper we solve a continuous version of the model in Kleindorfer, Kriebel, Thompson, and Kleindorfer (Kleindorfer, P. R., C. H. Kriebel, G. L. Thompson, G. B. Kleindorfer. 1975. Discrete optimal control of production plans. Management Sci. 22 261 [...] 273.) in complete detail. The reason {{we are able to}} obtain a complete solution (which can rarely be done in control models) is that the linear decision rule, which is optimal here as in other quadratic models, permits the elimination of the <b>adjoint</b> <b>function</b> from the state variable equation after one differentiation of the latter. Thus the difficult two-point boundary value problem which usually arises in control problems is converted into an ordinary second order differential equation, which is readily solved. One advantage of having a complete solution to {{the problem is that it}} is possible to determine turnpike horizon points. These correspond to zeros of the <b>adjoint</b> <b>function,</b> and have the property that if they are known exactly, then a production-inventory plan which is optimal up to the next horizon point also forms part of the overall optimal plan. In the case of cyclic demand these turnpike horizon points usually occur every half cycle. Similar horizons are likely to exist in real production-inventory problems. A planning procedure for a real problem which extends only as far as a suspected horizon has a good chance of producing an optimal or near optimal solution for that period of time. A second advantage of having the complete solution available is that it is possible to develop a practical production-inventory system which intermingles a prediction procedure (such as the use of a finite Fourier series) with the solution procedure so that a comparison between predicted and actual inventories can be made continuously. Whenever the discrepancy between these two becomes sufficiently large, the model suggests proper corrective actions to be taken. inventory/production: planning horizons, forecasting...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{measurement}} of atmospheric concentrations by a monitoring network is a promising {{tool for the}} identification of the widespread sources of trace species. The paper addresses the case of the species scattered linearly by a known meteorology. The question is classical: what can be said about the source from a set of measurements? Is it possible to guess from the values observed by the measurements that the source is spread close to the detectors, or that the tracer comes from a remote region? And, if the source was a point source, would it be possible to understand it by just considering these values? A part of the answers is a matter of practical sense: the resolution with which an emission can be retrieved will always be limited and probably lower for a remote region, even if the detectors and dispersion model are error free. The paper proposes a linear strategy of inference: to any set of values taken by the observed concentrations is associated linearly an estimate of the source. Doubled values lead to a doubled estimate. The method, based on adjoint techniques, is intended to optimise the resolution by quantifying, with the concept of illumination, which regions are well, poorly or not seen at all. The illumination tied to ordinary <b>adjoint</b> <b>functions</b> becomes excessive close to the detectors thus leading to inversion artefacts. This may be corrected by attributing each point of the space time domain a geometric and statistical weight. The <b>adjoint</b> <b>functions</b> are transformed. The choice of this renormalising function is constrained by an unambiguous entropic criterion preventing any overestimation of the available information that would lead to artefacts.

40|$|Abstract–Although the Monte Carlo {{method is}} {{considered}} to be the most accurate method available for solving radiation transport problems, its applicability is limited by its computational expense. Thus, biasing techniques, which require intuition, guesswork, and iterations involving manual adjustments, are employed to make reactor shielding calculations feasible. To overcome this difficulty, we have developed a method for using the SN <b>adjoint</b> <b>function</b> for automated variance reduction of Monte Carlo calculations through source biasing and consistent transport biasing with the weight window technique. We describe the implementation of this method into the standard production Monte Carlo code MCNP and its application to a realistic calculation, namely, the reactor cavity dosimetry calculation. The computational effectiveness of the method, as demonstrated through the increase in calculational efficiency, is demonstrated and quantified. Important issues associated with this method and its efficient use are addressed and analyzed. Additional benefits in terms of the reduction in time and effort required of the user are difficult to quantify but are possibly as important as the computational efficiency. In general, the automated variance reduction method presented is capable of increases in computational performance on the order of thousands, {{while at the same time}} significantly reducing the current requirements for user experience, time, and effort.

The origins of this method is the renormalisation theory developed for the French military (DGA) to localise nuclear, radiologic or chemical emissions. However, it can be adapted for industrial use for major chemical platform. Currently, most methods for inverse modelling and source identification are based on a Bayesian approach. However, these methods have both theoretical and conceptual limitations, and, uncertainties about their performances, which make them hardly adequate to the problem of detection and identification of NBC releases. The renormalization theory allows, through the precise knowledge of wind fields, to identify a source of pollution from atmospheric tracer, provided by a network of sensors to various instants over the area of interest. Because a sensor network does not perceive all the points of the environment fairly in Euclidean geometry, a new geometry is determined from the correlation of the <b>adjoint</b> <b>functions</b> from the various sensors providing a mapping of sensitivity of the sensor. The quality of the reconstruction depends on the good modeled representation of the physical dispersion proposed.
