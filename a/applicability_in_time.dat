40|$|We {{propose a}} method for the {{construction}} of simultaneous confidence bands for (a smoothed version of) the spectral density of a Gaussian process based on nonparametric kernel esti-mators obtained by smoothing the periodogram. A studentized statistic is used to deter-mine the width of the band at each frequency and a frequency domain bootstrap approach is employed in order to estimate the distribution of the supremum of this statistic over all frequencies. We prove by means of strong approximations that the bootstrap estimates consistently the distribution of the supremum deviation of interest and, consequently, that the proposed confidence bands achieve asymptotically the desired simultaneous cov-erage probability. The behavior of our method in finite sample situations is investigated by simulations and a real-life data example demonstrates its <b>applicability</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> series analysis. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

The traditional algorithms used for knowledge discovery are bottle necked due to wide range of data sources availability. Unbalanced dataset learning is a new paradigm of machine learning which has <b>applicability</b> <b>in</b> real <b>time,</b> since all the datasets of real time are of unbalanced in nature.

40|$|Historically {{underwater}} explosions (UEs) {{have been}} investigated for their huge military relevance, but they remain an important issue also for civil marine applications. As an example, UEs can occur near or on oil-gas plants due to severe environmental conditions or human errors and this has substantial consequences for the production. Preliminary information about time scales of the phenomenon and knowledge about possible strategies on how to limit the consequences of its interaction with close-by structures is crucial to make the proper decisions. A numerical investigation would in general require a 3 D compressible (at least) two-phase hydro-dynamic solver strongly coupled with a suitable model of the involved structure. Because the CPU-time requirements are still too high for reliable and feasible predictions, a Domain Decomposition (DD) strategy has been proposed by Colicchio et al. (2013) and Colicchio et al. (2014) and applied to a fully coupled fluid-structure analysis by Colicchio et al. (2015). Here, the DD is further extended as Dynamic DD (DDD) to overcome limits of <b>applicability</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> The dynamic strategy proposed {{is not limited to}} UEs problems and to the two coupled solvers involved. When examining the UE interaction with a marine structure, like a surface ship, one can distinguish basically two stages: the first one, with important compressible effects and local fluid-structure interactions; the second one, with global consequences for the structure, possibly involving large deformations and damages as well as free-surface waves generation. The present research focuses on the first stage but the proposed DDD strategy can be adopted also for the second stage...|$|E

Among these accidents, approximately 60 % are due to driver inattentiveness and fatigue. Such accidents have prompted the development of many driver assistance systems (DASs), such as the onboard lane departure warning systems (LDWSs) and forward collision warning systems. These systems can prevent drivers from making mistakes {{on the road and}} can reduce traffic accidents. An effective DAS should satisfy the following requirements: accuracy, reliability, robustness, low cost, compact design, low dissipation, and <b>applicability</b> <b>in</b> real <b>time,</b> etc. Therefore, a personal computer, for example, is not suitable for the DAS platform because of its high cost and large size.|$|R

The checkpoint intervals are adjusted to minimize the impact of stresses and permanent faults on the running hosts. This novel mechanism allows greater <b>applicability</b> <b>in</b> real <b>time</b> systems with hard deadline such as weather prediction, financial transactions etc. We compare the estimated completion time for increasing fault-rate in the system against five existing algorithms.

The application of interpolation techniques is illustrated in two case studies: temporal interpolation of indicators for ecological water quality, and spatio-temporal interpolation and aggregation of pesticide concentrations in Dutch surface waters. A valuable next step will be to construct a decision tree or decision support system, that guides the environmental scientist to easy-to-use software implementations that are appropriate to solve their interpolation problem.

Thermosyphon has superior heat transferability thus it is suitable for application in free cooling. However, a separate thermosyphon free cooling system usually cannot provide sufficient cooling capacity in warm seasons. In order to overcome this weakness and avoid two sets of equipment, hybrid system of thermosyphon free cooling and vapor compression refrigeration for data centers has been developed by researchers. The cooling performance of this kind of system depends greatly on the climate outside therefore its <b>applicability</b> <b>in</b> different <b>time</b> and zones needs to be studied. In this paper, the climate data from five cities of different climate zones in China is collected. The performance model of the hybrid system is built up. Based on the climate data and performance model, the annual energy consumption is then calculated and compared with traditional air conditioner. The result shows that the energy-saving potential of the hybrid system varies in different climate zones, and when the mode switching temperature is relatively high, it is distinct in most climate zones of China...|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} in supply of crude {{has led to}} a dramatic slump in its price which has refused to bounce back as initially speculated. In effect, oil and gas industry is experiencing turmoil in its businesses and operations; therefore it is essential that there is a re-structure in these activities to negate the effect. This can only be attained if it adopts a smarter and cost-effective approach. The only acceptable condition under which chemical enhanced oil recovery can continue to apply in this era of low crude oil price is if the chemicals are cheap, multifunctional and considered to be smart. This study presents a review of chemical enhanced oil recovery and its <b>applicability</b> <b>in</b> uneconomic <b>times.</b> The success of CEOR is highly dependent on the microscopic and macroscopic recovery mechanisms involved as well as the reservoir rock physico-geochemical nature. Synergistic methods in CEOR is considered to be cost-effective as they exploit a combination of recovery mechanisms simultaneous in order to improve sweep efficiency, however before deployment, the technique and design must be tested extensively via lab core floods, pilot projects and dedicated numeric simulations. A Cheaper and potentially cost-effective chemical agent is the new breeds of giant-molecule surfactants. A special type of polymeric surfactants is the wormlike micelle solutions that even have superior rheological properties as they possess the tendency to increase recovery at minimal cost...|$|R

Je zde zmíněna svoboda a její ekonomický, náboženský a antropologický vývoj v kultuře. Dále je zde ukázán přímo vývoj člověka. Fromm i Marcuse vycházeli ze Zikmunda Freuda a Karla Marxe. V jedné kapitole nám Fromm ukazuje vývoj lidského charakteru a Marcuse zase rozebírá vývoj Ega, které musí svádět boje s Id a Superegem. Kapitola o společnosti se více zabývá kapitalismem a zde autoři vycházeli z výše zmiňovaného Karla Marxe. Katedra filozofieObhájenoThis {{bachelor}} thesis {{concerns the}} approach to various aspects of human being in Erich Fromm and Herbert Marcuse philosophy. Primarily, it deals with freedom, society and human being. In the opening part, Frankfurt School is briefly introduced. Both authors were its members and were formed by this school. Freedom is mentioned here together with its economical, religious and anthropoligical evolution in culture. Further, evolution of human being is shown here. Both Fromm and Marcuse patterned Sigmund Freud and Karl Marx. In one chapter, Fromm shows us evolution of human character and, on the other hand, Marcuse analyses evolution of Ego, which must fight with Id and Superego. The chapter about society deals with capitalism and both authors patterned Karl Marx who was mentioned above. Fromm represents his concept of having and being modus. Marcuse shows us technological progress in industrial society. In the conclusion, theories of both philosophers will be compared and their <b>applicability</b> <b>in</b> present <b>time</b> will be considered...|$|R
