The declension is normally not followed when citing Latin patrial names in English, [...] "of Giraldus Cambrensis," [...] but may cause confusion when trying to identify the nominative spellings of patrial names from Latin or Greek sources.|$|R

In order to accomplish such a study, 25 morphologically-annotated texts taken from the Tycho Brahe Historical Portuguese Corpus, as well as excerpts from randomly selected on-line newspaper articles were used. The theoretical basis which supports this analysis is Stephen Anderson (1992) `s study on the -&# 1241;ble-suffixed <b>adjective</b> <b>rules</b> of word formation in English in derivational morphology. The UNIX tools developed by Professor Dr. Leonel Figueiredo de Alencar Araripe were the commands used {{in the analysis of}} the Tycho Brahe Historical Portuguese Corpus texts. The study results demonstrate that the -vel adjective formation in the Portuguese language depends on the speaker`s / listener`s competence in making use of their mental grammar. This research also shows that the creation mechanisms of -vel adjectives is described by means of word formation rules concerning both the result in the formation process of adjectives and the analysis of the structures which allow the formation of new -vel-suffixed adjectives. Este estudo analisa as regras de formaÃÃo dos adjetivos sufixados com -vel na lÃngua portuguesa. Para isso, escolheram-se 25 textos anotados morfologicamente do Corpus HistÃrico do PortuguÃs Tycho Brahe e textos de artigos de jornais on-line selecionados aleatoriamente, visando-se os adjetivos em -vel. Apresenta-se como teoria basilar o estudo sobre as regras de formaÃÃo de palavras em inglÃs de adjetivos com sufixo - able de Stephen Anderson (1992), dentro da morfologia derivacional. Para as anÃlises no Corpus HistÃrico do PortuguÃs Tycho Brahe, sÃo usados comandos de ferramentas do UNIX desenvolvidos pelo Professor Dr. Leonel Figueiredo de Alencar. Os resultados obtidos atravÃs das anÃlises demonstraram que a formaÃÃo dos adjetivos em -vel, na lÃngua portuguesa sÃo produtos da competÃncia do falante/ouvinte ao fazer uso de sua gramÃtica mental. Esta pesquisa demonstrou que os mecanismos de criaÃÃo dos adjetivos em -vel sÃo descritos atravÃs das regras de formaÃÃo de palavras cujas funÃÃes sÃo indicar o processo formativo do adjetivo quanto ao resultado, bem como analisar as estruturas com que a lÃngua pode formar novos adjetivos com o sufixo -vel...|$|R
5000|$|In Lithuanian, the {{distinction}} between acute and circumflex is not preserved in unstressed syllables. In Standard Lithuanian, based on the Aukštaitian dialect, the acute becomes a falling tone (so-called [...] "Lithuanian metatony") and is marked with an acute accent, and the circumflex becomes a rising tone, marked with a tilde. In diphthongs, the acute accent {{is placed on the}} first letter of the diphthong while the tilde marking rising tone (the original circumflex) is placed on the second letter. In diphthongs with a sonorant as a second part, the same convention is used, but the acute accent is replaced with a grave accent: Lithuanian [...] 'full' < PIE [...] ). Word-finally, the acute was regularly shortened: [...] 'good' (indefinite adjective) : geróji 'the good' (definite <b>adjective).</b> That <b>rule</b> is called Leskien's law after the German neogrammarian August Leskien.|$|R
40|$|Reviewed by Francisco CoutoWe {{present a}} new method for {{automatically}} enlarging a sentiment lexicon for mining social judgments from text, i. e., extracting opinions about human subjects. We use a two-step approach: first, we find which adjectives {{can be used}} as human modifiers, and then we assign their polarity attribute. To identify the human modifiers, we developed a set of hand-crafted lexico-syntactic rules representing elementary copular and adnominal constructions where such predicates can be found. These are applied to a large n-gram collection, gathering evidence about human/not-human adjective behavior. The <b>adjective</b> and <b>rule</b> frequencies are then used as input features to a statistical classifier. In the second and final stage, we assign polarities to human adjectives, by exploring the graph of synonyms. We calculate the shortest distances of each adjective with unknown polarity to the human adjectives of each sentiment class with prior polarity in the initial lexicon. The computed distances for each adjective are then used as the input features of a statistical polarity classifier. The application of the proposed method to a collection of manually annotated adjectives showed its effectiveness for developing a fine-grained sentiment lexicon for social judgment, which {{can be seen as a}} human domain-specific alternative to general-purpose lexicons. We focus on the polarity classification of Portuguese human adjective predicates, but the studied method could be applied to other languages and semantic predicates. The lexicon of human adjectives with polarities produced with this method is now available as an open resource...|$|R
5000|$|Latin prose often {{follows the}} word order Subject, Indirect Object, Direct Object, Adverb, Verb" [...] (commonly {{known by the}} acronym [...] "SIDAV"), but this {{is more of a}} {{guideline}} than a <b>rule.</b> <b>Adjectives</b> normally go after a noun they modify (either the Subject or the Object), but this is not absolutely required. In practice, there is great flexibility in word order, though the one rule usually followed is that the verb goes last in the sentence. Nonetheless, it is not incorrect grammar to use a completely different word order. Putting a word earlier in the sentence increases the emphasis on it, but this subtlety would only be particularly obvious to a native Latin speaker. However, even in Classical Latin poetry, lyricists followed word order very loosely to achieve a desired scansion. Romulus urbem condiderat (Subject Object Verb) is preferable, but there is nothing explicitly incorrect with condiderat urbem Romulus (Verb Object Subject).|$|R
40|$|Swahili Language Manager (SALAMA) is a {{computational}} {{environment for}} managing written Swahili language and for developing {{various kinds of}} language applications. Having been subject to development since 1985, it currently (2004) contains the Standard Swahili lexicon as fully as possible. As it is a system for managing the language, it includes also the full morphological and morpho-phonological description of Swahili, a rule-based system for solving the word level ambiguities, a rule-based system for tagging text syntactically (including alternatively a shallow Constraint Grammar parsing or a deep Dependency Grammar parsing), a rule-based system for handling idiomatic expressions, proverbs and other non-standard clusters of words, and a semantic tagging and disambiguation system for defining correct semantic equivalents in English. SALAMA facilitates also a raw translation from Swahili to English, including the correct surface forms in English (e. g. verbs, nouns and <b>adjectives)</b> and transfer <b>rules</b> for the correct English word order. An essential part in developing and testing SALAMA is the Helsinki Corpus of Swahili, which has been under construction since 1988 and is currently globally available at the Language Bank of Finland (www. csc. fi). The paper discusses all these features in detail...|$|R
5000|$|By calling {{language}} an instinct, Pinker {{means that}} it is not a human invention in the sense that metalworking and even writing are. While only some human cultures possess these technologies, all cultures possess language. As further evidence for the universality of language, Pinker notes that children spontaneously invent a consistent grammatical speech (a creole) even if they grow up among a mixed-culture population speaking an informal trade pidgin with no consistent rules. Deaf babies [...] "babble" [...] with their hands as others normally do with voice, and spontaneously invent sign languages with true grammar rather than a crude [...] "me Tarzan, you Jane" [...] pointing system. Language (speech) also develops in the absence of formal instruction or active attempts by parents to correct children's grammar. These signs suggest that rather than being a human invention, language is an innate human ability. Pinker also distinguishes language from humans' general reasoning ability, emphasizing {{that it is not}} simply a mark of advanced intelligence but rather a specialized [...] "mental module". He distinguishes the linguist's notion of grammar, such as the placement of <b>adjectives,</b> from formal <b>rules</b> such as those in the American English writing style guide. He argues that because rules like [...] "a preposition is not a proper word to end a sentence with" [...] must be explicitly taught, they are irrelevant to actual communication and should be ignored.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Patients with {{damage to}} the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) are often not {{impaired}} in understanding simple sentences. It is, however, possible that the damage may cause subclinical effects. If VLPFC has a role in biasing competition towards what is relevant to the task, we would expect patients with VLPFC damage to be slower in using the relevant information and discarding the irrelevant information when they process sentences online. Methods: Nine patients, five with lesions limited to VLPFC, and four with lesions sparing VLPFC participated. The groups were matched in age, education, WAB-AQ and total lesion volume. Two experiments explored processing of online cues during sentence comprehension by tracking eye fixations in a Visual World paradigm with four pictures. Participants only listened to the sentences {{and looked at the}} pictures. Experiment 1 investigated how quickly cues can be used for target identification using a simple “She will [verb] the [target]. ” sentence structure. The verbs in the restrictive condition were compatible with only one of the four pictures (e. g., “eat”; target “apple” + three inedible competitors). The verbs in the control conditions were matched to the restrictive verbs in length and frequency, but did not point to a unique target (e. g., “see”). If VLPFC is critical for quickly biasing competition towards the relevant target, the VLPFC patients should to be slower than the non-VLPFC patients in fixating the noun when the verb is restrictive. Experiment 2 probed how effectively irrelevant cues are suppressed. A similar Visual World paradigm was used, but all verbs were restrictive, and one of the distractors was also compatible with the verb (e. g., “banana”). The sentences contained an <b>adjective</b> that <b>ruled</b> out one of verb-compatible pictures (e. g., “red”). The critical manipulation involved a third picture (the adjective competitor) which was compatible with the adjective, but not with the verb (e. g., “heart”; note that all pictures were black and white line drawings). The control condition was similar, except that the adjective competitor was replaced by a picture compatible with neither the verb, nor the adjective (e. g., “frog”). If VLPFC is important for biasing competition away from the irrelevant information, we expect the VLPFC lesion group to exhibit more continued looks to the adjective competitor compared to the non-VLPFC lesion group. Results: Data are shown in Fig. 1. The data were analyzed using Growth Curve Analysis. Experiment 1 : In the time window from the verb onset to noun onset, the VLPFC lesion group exhibited reliably less target anticipation than the non-VLPFC lesion group (patient group* condition interaction: t = 10. 632, p < 0. 001). Exp. 2 : In the time window from the adjective onset {{to the end of the}} sentence, the VLPFC lesion patients were significantly more likely to fixate the adjective competitor (e. g., “heart”) than the non-VLPFC patients were (patient group* condition interaction: t = 2. 615; p =. 009). Conclusions: The results are compatible with a biasing competition role of VLPFC in sentence production: VLPFC facilitates processing of the relevant information and inhibits processing of the irrelevant information...|$|R
