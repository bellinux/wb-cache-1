5|$|On August 8, 2010, Banister {{was named}} the Pirates' interim bench coach after Gary Varsho was fired by the organization. At {{the end of the}} 2010 season, the Pirates fired manager John Russell. Banister and Clint Hurdle were the two finalists for the position. The Pirates named Hurdle as their manager, and Banister {{was named the}}ir {{full-time}} bench coach. As the Pirates bench coach, Banister learned about sabermetrics from a quantitative <b>analyst</b> <b>who</b> traveled with the team. Banister learned to use quantitative data to inform his decisions on when the Pirates should employ defensive shifts in the field. He was initially chosen to manage Scottsdale in the AFL after the 2014 season, but he was replaced by Pirates' special assistant Frank Kremblas due to the possibility of the Pirates reaching the MLB postseason.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} based on Murray Burnett and Joan Alison's then-unproduced play Everybody Comes to Rick's. The Warner Bros. story <b>analyst</b> <b>who</b> read the play, Stephen Karnot, called it (approvingly) [...] "sophisticated hokum", and story editor Irene Diamond, who had {{discovered}} the unproduced play {{on a trip to}} New York in 1941, convinced producer Hal Wallis to buy the rights in January 1942 for $20,000, the most anyone in Hollywood had ever paid for an unproduced play. The project was renamed Casablanca, apparently in imitation of the 1938 hit Algiers. Although an initial filming date was selected for April 10, 1942, delays led to a start of production on May 25. Filming was completed on August 3, and the production cost $1,039,000 ($75,000 over budget), above average for the time. Unusually, the film was shot in sequence, mainly because only {{the first half of the}} script was ready when filming began.|$|E
500|$|Kathryn Bigelow's thriller Zero Dark Thirty marked Chastain's final film {{release of}} 2012. The film tells a partly fictionalized {{account of the}} decade-long manhunt for Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after the September 11 attacks. Chastain was cast as Maya, an emotionally {{hardened}} CIA intelligence <b>analyst</b> <b>who</b> helped kill bin Laden. The difficult subject matter made it unpleasant for Chastain to film. She suffered from depression while working and once walked off the set in tears because {{she was unable to}} continue. Chastain was unable to meet the undercover agent on whom Maya was based and she relied on the screenwriter Mark Boal's research. Zero Dark Thirty received critical acclaim but was controversial for scenes of torture that were shown providing useful intelligence in the search for bin Laden. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone thought that Chastain played Maya [...] "like a gathering storm in an indelible, implosive performance that cuts so deep we can feel her nerve endings". Roger Ebert made note of Chastain's versatility, and favorably compared her ability and range to that of actress Meryl Streep. For her performance, Chastain won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama and earned Academy, BAFTA and SAG nominations for Best Actress.|$|E
