5|$|As {{early as}} June 1961, General Maxwell D. Taylor, President John F. Kennedy's special {{military}} representative, had {{become interested in}} the prospect of erecting a physical barrier to halt the increasing infiltration of PAVN materiel (and later, manpower) through their Laotian logistical corridor and into the border regions of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). He then held talks with the Deputy Director of the Pentagon's Office of Special Operations, Edward G. Lansdale, who convinced him that <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>solution</b> to the infiltration dilemma would be the creation of mobile units to attack the infiltrators.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} sinkhole's collapse, there were plans {{to fill it}} in with a soil cement made from cement, limestone, and water known locally as lodocreto ("mudcrete"). This {{substance}} was also used {{to fill in the}} 2007 Guatemala City sinkhole. However, another technique, which geologists call the graded-filter technique, in which the sinkhole is filled with successive layers of boulders, smaller rocks, and gravel, could possibly be <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>solution.</b> This is because filling the hole in with cement diverts water runoff to other areas, potentially increasing the risk of sinkholes occurring {{in other parts of the}} city. The graded-filter technique, on the other hand, allows water to seep through.|$|E

Crossover operators play very important role by constructing competitive Genetic Algorithms (GAs). In this paper, the basic conceptual features and specific characteristics of various crossover operators {{in the context of}} the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) are discussed. The results of experimental comparison of more than six different crossover operators for the TSP are presented. The experiment results show that OX operator enables to achieve <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>solutions</b> than other operators tested...|$|R
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>better</b> <b>solution</b> was {{proposed}} {{as long ago}} as 1980 by Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA Maryland, USA) who called their device a 'dynapod'. Their idea is to re-engineer common Home appliance with small (fractional – less than 1-horsepower) electric motors (c. 500W – 1000W) which are used for short periods, for example food mixers, grinding machines, hand-held power-drills and light wood-working equipment.|$|E
25|$|Aware {{that most}} new arrivals planned {{to stay in}} the region after the war, local {{municipal}} governments, Los Angeles County and the state agreed that a massive infrastructure improvement program was necessary. At that time politicians agreed to construct a web of freeways across the region. This was seen as <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>solution</b> than a new mass transit system or an upgrade of the PE.|$|E
25|$|During a {{demonstration}} of the E.28/39 to Winston Churchill in April 1943, Whittle proposed to Stafford Cripps, Minister of Aircraft Production, that all jet development be nationalised. He pointed out that the company had been funded by private investors who helped develop the engine successfully, only to see production contracts go to other companies. Nationalisation {{was the only way to}} repay those debts and ensure a fair deal for everyone, and he was willing to surrender his shares in Power Jets to make this happen. In October, Cripps told Whittle that he decided <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>solution</b> would be to nationalise Power Jets only.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>better</b> <b>solution</b> {{came along}} {{in the form of}} the US's AGM-48 Skybolt missile. The US bomber force was facing the same sorts of {{problems}} as the British V bombers, and were attempting to solve it in a similar fashion, with a long-range standoff missile. In this case, however, the missile in question had a truly long range of just under 2,000km. Considering the distance from London to Moscow is about 2,500km, Skybolt would allow the V-bomber force to attack Russia from sites not far off the British coast, with complete immunity. Skybolt seemed like such a good solution that work on both Blue Steel II and Blue Streak were cancelled.|$|E
25|$|A second Blenheim, V6000, became {{available}} for additional testing. The team {{began to use}} this aircraft as a testbed for alternate scanning solutions, leaving the original N3522 with the spiral-scan system. One of the first tests was to use a manual scanning system {{in place of the}} spiral or helical systems, allowing the operator to scan the sky using controls on his receiver sets. Once a target was found, they could flip a switch and the system would track that target automatically from that point. After considerable effort, they decided this concept simply didn't work, and that the mechanical scanning systems were <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>solution.</b>|$|E
25|$|Almost immediately, a {{committee}} {{was set up}} to look at options for converting {{all or part of the}} canals into railways, and extending the network. Although they had already tried using a steam tug to haul a train of boats, they realised that not all of their canals were suitable for such use, and that a locomotive on a railway with good gradients offered <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>solution.</b> The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal were alarmed by the announcement that many of the canals might close, on the basis that removal of one would have a serious effect on another, and sought to oppose the action.|$|E

25|$|After the fur trade {{declined}} in the mid-nineteenth century, Prairie du Chien's attention shifted to agriculture and the railroad. Although the city was first connected to the Milwaukee & Mississippi Railroad in 1857, {{the width of the}} Mississippi River posed a challenge for further expansion of the railroad into Iowa. This problem was temporarily solved by disassembling the trains at Prairie du Chien and ferrying them across the river to be put back on the tracks on the other side. <b>A</b> <b>better</b> <b>solution</b> was found by Michael Spettel and John Lawler, who designed a permanent pontoon bridge to span the river in 1874. Lawler took most of the credit for this invention, and made a small fortune through its operation.|$|E
25|$|Murtaja {{was often}} criticized for her poor {{performance}} in difficult ice conditions and she was deemed old and obsolete already in 1906. Selling her was set as a prerequisite for ordering a new icebreaker, but while several foreign ports were interested in purchasing Murtaja, in September 1906 the Senate decided to order the third state-owned icebreaker, Tarmo, without selling the old one. As more modern icebreakers entered service in the 1920s, Murtaja was again deemed obsolete and worn-out, and she was criticized for her high operating costs. She {{was said to be}} in need of complete overhaul and rebuilding in 1926, but the Finnish Board of Navigation did not agree to this until almost ten years later, although it noted that decommissioning her would probably be <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>solution.</b>|$|E
25|$|Delays and {{failures}} in the Granite programme and the abandonment of Green Bamboo without a test, left {{a gap in the}} programme and an emergency capability weapon to fill that gap was devised from elements of both Green Bamboo and Orange Herald; being known as Knobkerry, or Green Grass, and the Interim Megaton Weapon. There were also other factors involved in the decision to build an Interim Megaton Weapon. One being that the UK HEU production programme was by 1957 producing quantities of HEU for which there was no immediate need; and the Chiefs of Staff were reluctant to see it continue to languish in stores, unused for weapons, when it was being produced at great cost. The Green Grass warhead containing perhaps 70–86kg of HEU (although there are no reliable declassified sources for this figure) was therefore hurriedly produced and installed in a modified Blue Danube casing, to be known as Violet Club, until <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>solution</b> based on the Yellow Sun casing could be produced, known then with Green Grass installed, as Yellow Sun Mk.1. Only five Violet Club weapons were produced, known by the RAF description of Bomb, Aircraft, HE 9,000lb HC, and they were stripped of their Green Grass warheads for transfer to the better casings when these became available.|$|E

500|$|A rivalry {{emerged in}} 1931 between the NAACP and the Communist Party, when the Communists responded quickly and {{effectively}} {{to support the}} Scottsboro Boys, nine African-American youth arrested in 1931 in Alabama for rape. Du Bois and the NAACP felt that the case would not be beneficial to their cause, so they chose to let the Communist Party organize the defense efforts. Du Bois {{was impressed with the}} vast amount of publicity and funds the Communists devoted to the partially successful defense effort, and he came to suspect that the Communists were attempting to present their party to African Americans as <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>solution</b> than the NAACP. Responding to criticisms of the NAACP from the Communist Party, Du Bois wrote articles condemning the party, claiming that it unfairly attacked the NAACP, and that it failed to fully appreciate racism in the United States. The Communist leaders, in turn, accused Du Bois of being a [...] "class enemy", and claimed that the NAACP leadership was an isolated elite, disconnected from the working-class blacks they ostensibly fought for.|$|E

500|$|The λ/4 coupled line {{design is}} good for coaxial and {{stripline}} implementations but does not work so well in the now popular microstrip format, although designs do exist. [...] The {{reason for this is}} that microstrip is not a homogeneous medium – there are two different mediums above and below the transmission strip. [...] This leads to transmission modes other than the usual TEM mode found in conductive circuits. [...] The propagation velocities of even and odd modes are different leading to signal dispersion. [...] <b>A</b> <b>better</b> <b>solution</b> for microstrip is a coupled line much shorter than λ/4, shown in figure 5, but this has the disadvantage of a coupling factor which rises noticeably with frequency. [...] A variation of this design sometimes encountered has the coupled line a higher impedance than the main line such as shown in figure 6. [...] This design is advantageous where the coupler is being fed to a detector for power monitoring. [...] The higher impedance line results in a higher RF voltage for a given main line power making the work of the detector diode easier.Vizmuller, pp.102–103 ...|$|E
500|$|James's {{attitude}} towards Catholics was more moderate {{than that of}} his predecessor, perhaps even tolerant.

[...] Some Catholics believed that the martyrdom of James's mother, Mary, Queen of Scots, would encourage James to convert to the Catholic faith, and the Catholic houses of Europe may also have shared that hope. [...] James received an envoy from the Habsburg Archduke Albert of the Southern Netherlands, ruler of the remaining Catholic territories after over 30years of war in the Dutch Revolt by English-supported Protestant rebels. [...] For the Catholic expatriates engaged in that struggle, the restoration by force of a Catholic monarchy was an intriguing possibility, but following the failed Spanish invasion of England in 1588 the papacy had taken a longer-term view on the return of a Catholic monarch to the English throne.|$|E
500|$|Piracy against American {{merchant}} shipping {{had not been}} a problem before 1776, when ships from the Thirteen Colonies were protected by British warships and treaties (nor was it a problem during the revolution, as the French Navy assumed the responsibility as part of the alliance treaty). Only after the U.S. achieved its independence did Barbary pirates begin capturing American ships, and demanding ransom or tribute. Additionally, once the French Revolution started, the British Navy began intercepting American merchant ships suspected of trading with France, and France began intercepting American merchant ships suspected of trading with Great Britain. Defenseless, the American government could do little to resist. Even given these events there was great resistance in Congress to formation of a naval force. Opponents asserted that payment of tribute to the Barbary states was <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>solution</b> than building a navy, which they argued would only lead to calls for a navy department, and the staff to operate it. This would then lead to more appropriations of funds, which would eventually spiral out of control, giving birth to a [...] "self-feeding entity." [...] Then, in 1793, a truce negotiated between Portugal and Algiers ended Portugal's blockade of the Strait of Gibraltar, freeing the Barbary pirates to roam the Atlantic. Within months, they had captured 11 American vessels and more than a hundred seamen.|$|E
