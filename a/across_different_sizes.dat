40|$|AbstractBackgroundPreviously, we {{examined}} the difference in stent designs <b>across</b> <b>different</b> <b>sizes</b> for six widely used Drug Eluting Stents (DESs). Although stent post-dilatation to larger diameter is commonly done, typically {{in the setting of}} long tapering segment or left-main PCI, there is an increasing recognition that information with regard to the different stent model designs has a critical impact on overexpansion results. This study aims to provide an update on stent model designs for contemporary DES platforms as well as test overexpansion results under with oversized post-dilatation. Methods and resultsWe studied 6 different contemporary commercially available DES platforms: Synergy, Xience Xpedition, Ultimaster, Orsiro, Resolute Onyx and Biomatrix Alpha. We investigated for each platform the difference in stent designs <b>across</b> <b>different</b> <b>sizes</b> and results obtained after post-expansion with larger balloon sizes. The stents were deployed at nominal diameter and subsequently over expanded using increasingly large post dilatation balloon sizes (4. 0, 5. 0 and 6. 0 mm at 14 ATM). Light microscopy was used to measure the changes in stent geometry and lumen diameter after over-expansion. For each respective DES platform, the MLD observed after overexpansion of the largest stent size available with a 6. 0 mm balloon was 5. 7 mm for Synergy, 5. 6 mm for Xience, 5. 2 mm for Orsiro, 5. 8 mm for Ultimaster, 5. 5 mm for 4 mm Onyx (5. 9 mm for the 5 mm XL size) and 5. 8 mm for BioMatrix Chroma. ConclusionThis update presents valuable novel insights that may be helpful for careful selection of stent size for contemporary DES based on model designs. Such information is especially critical in left main bifurcation stenosis treatment where overexpansion to larger oversized diameter may be required to ensure full stent apposition...|$|E

By using a regression model of physician supply, this study developed a proxy for physician carrying capacity and a deviation indicator to classify townships as attractive or unattractive. The results of this study indicate that: (1) within attractive townships, the greater the deviation from physician carrying capacity, the faster the growth rate of the physician-population ratio; (2) the overall pattern of the growth rate is quite similar <b>across</b> <b>different</b> <b>sizes</b> of townships; and (3) due to a loss of population, unattractive townships do not necessarily have the lowest growth rates of the physician-population ratio even though they gain few physicians.

40|$|A {{competitive}} {{banking industry}} {{is essential to}} enhance financial system efficiency. An efficient financial system contributes to accelerated economic growth through its role in payment service delivery, macroeconomic policy transmission and safeguarding of financial stability. This thesis estimates competition in Indonesian banking covering all commercial banks in the recent three decades by using the recent refinement of the Panzar-Rosse method by Bikker, Shaffer and Spierdijk (2011). Furthermore, this study examines the determinants of competitive banking based on the contestable theory of Baumol (1982) by investigating the impact of state intervention, comparing the competitive behaviour of banks <b>across</b> <b>different</b> <b>sizes</b> and ownerships and researching the role of foreign penetration, market concentration and the macroeconomic environment. This thesis also studies the relationship between competitive banking and banking stability. The impact of competitive banking on banking stability has been recently discussed extensively both in the academic literature and media following the international banking and financial crises. The empirical estimation of Fixed Effect panel data shows that Indonesian banking worked in a monopolistically competitive market. The yearly estimations of H-statistics of the Panzar- Rosse method reveal that the industry was very competitive during the periods of banking reforms and liberalization between 1988 and 1994. The estimation {{of the impact of}} structural changes on competition presents evidences that the introduction of reforms in 1983 and 1988 and banking liberalization in 1988 and 1992 created a contestable market because the industry was open for new entrants and had less restrictions and controls. The estimation of the competitive behaviour of banks <b>across</b> <b>different</b> <b>sizes</b> and ownerships demonstrates that small banks, private banks and de novo banks are the main drivers of competition in the Indonesian banking industry. Whereas, the estimation of competitive behaviour of large banks indicates that market power facilitates collusion between large banks. The estimation of a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) in chapter five suggests that the larger access of foreign firms to the market, the lower market concentration and a favorable macroeconomic environment promoted competition in the banking industry. Regarding to the relationship between competitive banking and stability, the estimations based on the Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) methodology suggest that competitive banking promotes banking stability by lowering insolvency risk in the Indonesian banking industry. In a competitive environment, banks are more efficient and better capitalized to enable them in generating higher profits...|$|E

40|$|Changes in {{the size}} of the attentional focus and task {{difficulty}} often co-vary. Nevertheless, the neural processes underlying the attentional spotlight process and task difficulty are likely to differ from each other. To differentiate between the two, we parametrically varied the size of the attentional focus in a novel behavioral paradigm while keeping visual processing difficulty either constant or not. A behavioral control experiment proved that the present behavioral paradigm could indeed effectively manipulate the size of the attentional focus per se, rather than affecting purely perceptual processes or surface processing. Imaging results showed that neural activity in a dorsal frontoparietal network, including right superior parietal cortex (SPL), was positively correlated with the size of the attentional spotlight, irrespective of whether task difficulty was constant or varied <b>across</b> <b>different</b> <b>sizes</b> of attentional focus. In contrast, neural activity in the ventral frontoparietal network, including the right inferior parietal cortex (IPL), was positively correlated with increasing task difficulty.

40|$|Temperature {{monitoring}} using thermal sensors is {{an essential}} tool for evaluating the thermal behavior and sustaining the reliable operation in high-performance and high-power systems. With current technology scaling and integration trends timely and accurate detection of localized heating will be evermore important. In this work, we address {{the creation of a}} resource efficient sensor infrastructure for computing systems that are of regular nature, such as logic array-based computing platforms. We propose algorithms to embed thermal sensors into a regular structure to minimize the number of sensors and determine sensor locations required to maintain a given accuracy in temperature sensing for a given design. Our algorithms are tailored for minimal usage of thermal sensors to suit a variety of architectural conditions. For programmable logic arrays the highly application-specific usage of the hardware resources leads to unpredictable thermal profiles. As a result, post-manufacture instantiation of thermal sensors is desired, which in turn demands the use of native hardware resources, which can be scarce. We demonstrate that using our techniques the number of sensors required to monitor a set of hotspots is reduced by 75 % on an average, <b>across</b> <b>different</b> <b>sizes</b> of logic arrays for different hotspot distributions compared to a uniform distribution of sensors throughout the fabrics...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 The Oregon Long-Term Soil Quality Project was {{initiated}} to identify soil properties that respond rapidly to alternative management practices. Such practices included winter cover cropping, which was implemented at two experimental research stations and several grower fields throughout the Willamette Valley. The {{goal of this}} thesis was to identify the major impacts of cover cropping on soil microbial community structure, diversity, and substrate utilization potential. Microbial community structure was assessed by extracting fatty acids from soil and analyzing community fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles. Two different methods for extracting fatty acids were tested; these were the ester linked method and the MIDI method developed by Microbial ID, Inc. (Newark, DE). Both methods discriminated among communities from different soils, but the types and relative amounts of fatty acids extracted differed by method. Microbial communities also were characterized by their potential to utilize a diverse range of carbon substrates using the Biolog assay. In a laboratory incubation study, the Biolog assay demonstrated that the types and overall diversity of substrates utilized were affected by the complexity of carbon substrate added to soil. In addition, Biolog diversity was significantly correlated with community FAME richness (r = 0. 59). FAME and Biolog assays were applied to field soils of the Soil Quality Project. Changes occurred in microbial FAME structure and Biolog potential in response to winter cover cropping, but effects often were not observed until incorporation of cover crops to soil. In some soils containing cover crop residues, there were greater amounts of eukaryotic FAME markers compared to winter-fallow soils, suggesting greater fungal and protozoan populations in cover-cropped soil. Biolog diversity also was greater in cover-cropped soil compared to fallow soil, which may reflect the utilization of cover crop residues by soil microorganisms during the summer months. Community patterns <b>across</b> <b>different</b> <b>sizes</b> of soil aggregates also were assessed. Biolog diversity was heterogeneously distributed among aggregates, and winter cover cropping elevated FAME diversity across all but the largest (2. 0 - 5. 0 mm) aggregate size class.

Recent studies have found economies of scale among police units, however, different operational environments may suggest different levels of evolvement and, therefore, that different sizes of police units may operate on different production functions. Cost measurements that assume a homogeneous production function are therefore suspect. ^ A population oriented size criterion is developed to segregate police units into two groups of 2 ̆ 2 small 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 large 2 ̆ 2. The cost function appears to be stable within each group and only needs to be compared between the two groups. ^ Data consist of the merger of two large data bases for the year 1973. These are the Uniform Crime Reports: National Time Series Community-Level Database, and E. Ostrom 2 ̆ 7 s Decision-Related Research on the Organization of Service Delivery Systems in Metropolitan Areas: Police Protection. These data allow for a detailed specification of police production among 223 municipal police units. ^ Model 1 is estimated by OLS or GLS for eight crime specific clearance and crime rates where {{the effects of the}} left hand side variable are diminished by regression on aggregate endogenous variables. Model 2 is a simultaneous equation system that is estimated using a weighted-two-stage-least-squares procedure. Model 1 and Model 2 are specified exactly the same except that a necessary exclusion restriction in Model 2 is based upon the results of Model 1. This appears valid as the results of both models are generally comparable. Model 2 is regressed on aggregate crime and clearance rates in addition to the crime specific variables. ^ Joint F-tests indicate that the production or cost function is stable across both sizes of police units. There are significant economies of scale among the larger police units. On the other hand, 2 ̆ 2 local control 2 ̆ 2 may adversely affect the efficiency and output quality of smaller police units.

However, more herps can be captured by trapping (especially when associated with drift fences) than searching, because of personnel limitations. Pitfall traps more effectively captured most anurans, salamanders, lizards, and small snakes, while double-ended funnel traps effectively captured most large squamates. Funnel traps made of aluminum window screen were significantly better for catching smal...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes new methodologies for {{evaluating}} out-of-sample forecasting performance that are robust to {{the choice of}} the estimation window size. The methodologies involve evaluating the predictive ability of forecasting models over a wide range of window sizes. The authors show that the tests proposed in the literature may lack the power to detect predictive ability and might be subject to data snooping <b>across</b> <b>different</b> window <b>sizes</b> if used repeatedly. An empirical application shows the usefulness of the methodologies {{for evaluating}} exchange rate models' forecasting ability. Forecasting...|$|R
50|$|This is {{the annual}} dollar sale for a {{geography}} {{in millions of}} dollars.When dividing total sales for an outlet into ACV million dollar blocks, it allows for equivalization <b>across</b> inherently <b>different</b> <b>sized</b> market or retailers in size. A large share of sales in Des Moines {{may or may not}} be as important as having a lesser share in New York City. The open question in the above case can be resolved by dividing sales regardless of outlet into a sales rate per million dollars.|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to add {{empirical}} {{evidence to the}} corporate finance literature {{by looking at the}} financing decisions with a specific application to small companies {{in the context of the}} UK relatively highly regulated Main market, versus the lightly regulated Alternative Investment Market (AIM). I do this by gathering data on all quoted dead and alive companies in both markets from 1995 to 2008. I then split my sample firms in each market into <b>different</b> <b>size</b> groups and test my hypothesis within and across each group and each market. The thesis consists of six chapters. After an introductory chapter, I review the existing literature on capital structure and debt maturity controversies with an emphasis on recent empirical work. The next three chapters consist of three research papers. The first paper looks at the capital structure decisions of companies quoted in AIM and Main market <b>across</b> <b>different</b> <b>size</b> groups. In the second research paper, the maturity structure of debt is investigated in both markets. The third research paper tests the determinants of the delisting decision, particularly the effect of leverage using a sample of AIM companies. In the last chapter, I provide a summary of the main conclusions of the study and highlight some promising ideas for future research...|$|R
