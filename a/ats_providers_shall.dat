This article suggests applying the well known principle of mass customization to balance individuality and standardization in service agreements.

We develop a typology for positioning and classifying IT-service providers as mass customizers of service agreements. This categorization is based on commitment modularity types and points of customer involvement in the IT-service life cycle. We identify four generic archetypes of IT-service providers’ customization strategies and explain their characteristics by means of selected examples of actual ITservice agreement situations. Finally, we introduce a service model that enables IT-service providers to implement one specific archetype with a great balance in standardization and individuality. We therefore propose to (1) strictly separate the design of services from contracting and usage stages, (2) modularize self-contained commitments and (3) productize options and changes of a service agreement.

However, traditional Web service invocation may lead to unnecessary network traffic, long response time, and bottleneck problems <b>at</b> service <b>providers.</b> While a publish/subscribe model provides an advantage of prompt notification which can eliminate unnecessary network traffic, its achievement in interoperability is limited. By integrating Web services technologies with a publish/subscribe model, a pull-based architecture and a pushbased architecture are mentioned in this paper. The pull-based architecture uses the integrated solution based on traditional Web service invocation, still the bottleneck problems <b>at</b> service <b>providers</b> are likely to occur. Therefore, we propose an alternative, the push-based architecture which presents an innovative approach of using inversion of Web service invocation. Instead of letting service clients invoke services <b>at</b> service <b>providers</b> as usual, the service clients simply wait for updated information from the service providers. Experimental {{results showed that the}} response time was significantly minimized and the bottleneck problems <b>at</b> service <b>providers</b> were eliminated in the push-based architecture.
