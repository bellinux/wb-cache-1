40|$|Abstract. The {{applications}} of <b>air</b> <b>cushions</b> are briefly reviewed in airships and tethered aerostats. The stress distributions of <b>air</b> <b>cushions</b> are simulated by {{finite element analysis}} software according to its load-carrying characteristics. Three kinds of interlayer forms are proposed and simulated thereafter. A best form of interlayer has been obtained via comparing the different analyzing results. In addition, an empirical formula is proposed for the differential pressures and load {{at the top of}} the <b>air</b> <b>cushions,</b> with experiments in which two kinds of <b>air</b> <b>cushions</b> are designed and their load carrying abilities are evaluated. Some advices are then provided for the designing and using of <b>air</b> <b>cushions</b> at the end of this paper...|$|R

25|$|The Rohr prototype, officially {{called the}} Urban Tracked <b>Air</b> <b>Cushion</b> Vehicle (UTACV) and colloquially the Rohr Aerotrain, was {{propelled}} by linear motor and {{was designed to}} carry 60 passengers at 150mph (240km/h). It had a length of 94ft (28m) and an empty weight of 46,000 pounds (20.8 metric tons).|$|E

25|$|A real {{benefit of}} <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> {{vehicles}} in moving heavy loads over difficult terrain, such as swamps, was overlooked by {{the excitement of}} the British Government funding to develop high-speed hovercraft. It was not until the early 1970s that the technology was used for moving a modular marine barge with a dragline on board for use over soft reclaimed land.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of the <b>air</b> <b>cushions</b> under the oating body can signicantly change the overall dynamic behaviour of the body [1]. The idealisation of the problem as a rigid body case is not correct and the eects of the <b>air</b> <b>cushions</b> {{should be taken into}} account properly. This is {{the purpose of the present}} note. We consider rst the hydrodynamic part of the problem which will be solved under the usual assumption...|$|R
50|$|Important {{in the use}} of dunnage bags is {{that the}} size of the bag is {{determined}} by the void. If this does not match, the bags will not do their work properly with potential large damage to cargo and people. For <b>air</b> <b>cushions</b> it is important to avoid damage as a result of wear and tear. <b>Air</b> <b>cushions</b> should never be used as fillers against doors or any non-rigid surfaces or partitions.|$|R

25|$|Several {{attempts}} have been made to adopt <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> technology for use in fixed track systems, in order to utilize the lower frictional forces for delivering high speeds. The most advanced example of this was the Aérotrain, an experimental high speed hovertrain built and operated in France between 1965 and 1977. The project was abandoned in 1977 due to lack of funding, the death of its lead engineer and the adoption of the TGV by the French government as its high-speed ground transport solution.|$|E
25|$|The 1971–78 {{generation}} is mainly noted {{for the early}} use of two safety features that are now required on all cars in the United States, the aforementioned high-mounted taillights (although a somewhat similar feature had appeared briefly as an option on the Ford Thunderbird in the late 1960s), and from 1974 through 1976, the Toronado was part of GM's first experimental production run of driver- and passenger-side airbags, which GM named the <b>Air</b> <b>Cushion</b> Restraint System. These Toronados used a unique steering wheel and were fitted with a knee blocker beneath the driver's portion of the dashboard.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, the U.S. Department of Transport's Urban Mass Transit Administration funded several {{hovertrain}} projects, which {{were known as}} Tracked <b>Air</b> <b>Cushion</b> Vehicles or TACVs. They were also known as Aerotrains since one of the builders had a licence from Bertin's Aerotrain company. Three separate projects were funded. Research and development {{was carried out by}} Rohr, Inc., Garrett AiResearch and Grumman. The UMTA built an extensive test site in Pueblo, Colorado, with different types of tracks for the different technologies used by the prototype contractors. They managed to build prototypes and do a few test runs before the funding was cut.|$|E
25|$|The Expeditionary Transfer Dock {{concept is}} a large {{auxiliary}} support ship to facilitate the 'seabasing' of an amphibious landing force by acting as a floating base or transfer station that can be prepositioned off the target area. Troops, equipment, and cargo would {{be transferred to the}} MLP by large-draft ships, from where it can be moved ashore by shallower-draft vessels, landing craft like the Landing Craft <b>Air</b> <b>Cushion</b> (LCAC), or helicopters. In order to transfer vehicles from the larger ships to the ESD, the vessels were originally to be fitted with a Vehicle Transfer System; a ramp connecting the two ships alongside, and able to compensate for the movements of both vessels while underway.|$|E

Such flexibility would be useful following natural disasters and for supporting US Marines once they are ashore. The ESD supports a vehicle staging area, side port ramp, large mooring fenders, and up to three landing craft air cushioned vessel lanes.|$|E

25|$|Very tall {{buildings}} ("skyscrapers"), when built using modern lightweight materials, might sway uncomfortably (but not dangerously) in certain wind conditions. A {{solution to this}} problem is to include at some upper story a large mass, constrained, but free to move within a limited range, and moving on some sort of bearing system such as an <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> or hydraulic film. Hydraulic pistons, powered by electric pumps and accumulators, are actively driven to counter the wind forces and natural resonances. These may also, if properly designed, be effective in controlling excessive motion – with or without applied power – in an earthquake. In general, though, modern steel frame high rise buildings are not as subject to dangerous motion as are medium rise (eight to ten story) buildings, as the resonant period of a tall and massive building is longer than the approximately one second shocks applied by an earthquake.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Doctor and Ida use {{the lift}} cable {{to explore the}} pit, {{although}} the Doctor finds nothing but darkness far below. He then chooses to detach himself and fall, landing at the bottom thanks to an <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> and finds that he can breathe. Finding cave paintings depicting the Beast's final battle and imprisonment, the Doctor discovers two jars on pedestals {{a few feet from}} each other as their light reveals the physical form of the Beast. The Doctor quickly deduces from the unintelligible grunts coming from the Beast that its consciousness has already escaped and that Krop Tor was designed as the perfect prison for the Beast: its jailers devised the jars as a failsafe, since their destruction would cause the planet to plunge into the black hole with the body of the Beast destroyed, and the mind killed in the process. Although the Doctor realises he must also sacrifice Rose and the others to destroy the Beast, he smashes the jars anyway on faith in his companion. As the planet falls out of orbit, the Doctor accepts his fate by mocking the Beast, before stumbling across his TARDIS while fleeing the collapsing cave.|$|E
500|$|McDonnell {{test pilot}} Edwin Schoch was {{assigned}} to the project, riding in the XF-85 while it was stowed aboard the EB-29B, before attempting a [...] "free" [...] flight on 23 August 1948. After Schoch was released from the bomber at a height of 20,000ft (6,000 m), he completed a 10-minute proving flight at speeds between 180 and 250mph (290–400km/h), testing controls and maneuverability. When he attempted a hook-up, it became obvious the Goblin was extremely sensitive to the bomber's turbulence, as well as being affected by the <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> created by the two aircraft operating in close proximity. [...] Constant but gentle adjustments of throttle and trim were necessary to overcome the cushioning effect. After three attempts to hook onto the trapeze, Schoch miscalculated his approach and struck the trapeze so violently that the canopy was smashed and ripped free and his helmet and mask were torn off. He saved the prototype by making a belly landing on the reinforced skid at the dry lake bed at Muroc. [...] All flight testing was suspended for seven weeks while the XF-85 was repaired and modified. Schoch used the down period to undertake a series of problem-free dummy dockings with a Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star fighter.|$|E
