5|$|The {{ground of}} fettering {{discretion}} {{on this basis}} is distinct from the right to <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>hearing.</b> The latter relates to a separate ground of judicial review, namely, procedural impropriety, and particularly the audi alteram partem ("hear the other side") principle.|$|E
5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} the orders had been made without any notice or hearing, {{and they were not}} given an {{opportunity}} to explain or correct the allegations against them. This was contrary to natural justice, which requires a person to be given the right to be heard before his or her interest is violated. As natural justice is an essential aspect of both {{the rule of law and}} the equal treatment by the law of all persons, the appellants argued that the deprivation of their right to <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> was a violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution, which affords to all persons equality before the law and equal protection of the law.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the rule requiring <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> is broad enough to include the rule against bias since <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> must be an unbiased hearing. However, the rules are often treated separately. It is fundamental to fair procedure that both sides should be heard. The right to <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> requires that individuals are not penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the cases against them, a fair opportunity to answer them, and the opportunity to present their own cases.|$|E

25|$|The {{right to}} <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> {{requires}} that individuals {{should not be}} penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the case, a fair opportunity to answer it, {{and the opportunity to}} present their own case. The mere fact that a decision affects rights or interests is sufficient to subject the decision to the procedures required by natural justice. In Europe, the right to <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> is guaranteed by Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is said to complement the common law rather than replace it.|$|E
25|$|The Manila hostage crisis, officially {{known as}} the Rizal Park hostage-taking incident, took place when a disgruntled former Philippine National Police officer named Rolando Mendoza hijacked a tourist bus in Rizal Park, Manila, Philippines on August 23, 2010.

Mendoza claimed {{that he had been}} unfairly {{dismissed}} from his job, and demanded <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> to defend himself.|$|E
25|$|A {{procedural}} {{legitimate expectation}} is created when a representation {{is made by}} a public authority that it will follow a certain procedure before making a decision on the substantive merits of a particular case.

60|$|MY DEAR SIR:--In {{the summer}} of 1859, when Mr. Freeman visited Springfield, Illinois, in {{relation}} to the McCallister and Stebbins bonds I promised him that, upon certain conditions, I would ask members of the Legislature to give him <b>a</b> full and <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> of his case. I do not now remember, nor have I time to recall, exactly what the conditions were, nor whether they were completely performed; but there can be in no case any harm [in] his having <b>a</b> full and <b>fair</b> <b>hearing,</b> and I sincerely wish it may be given him.|$|R

The Commissioner prevailed in that effort, after which he and Rose entered settlement negotiations.|$|E
25|$|In addition, <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> {{may also}} include the rights to legal representation, to {{cross-examine}} witnesses, and to be given reasons for a decision; and a presumption in favour of an oral hearing. An applicant claiming a breach of the fair hearing requirement has {{to prove that he}} or she suffered substantial injustice since {{there is no such thing}} in law as a technical breach of natural justice. The requirements of fair hearing depend on the circumstances of the case such as the nature of the inquiry, the rules governing the tribunal, and the subject matter being dealt with.|$|E
25|$|Article 6 does not, however, {{replace the}} common law duty to ensure <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>hearing.</b> It has been {{suggested}} that Article 6 alone is not enough to protect procedural due process, and only with the development of a more sophisticated common law will the protection of procedural due process extend further into the administrative machine. Nonetheless, Article 6 supplements {{the common law}}. For example, the common law does not impose a general duty to give reasons for a decision, but under Article 6(1) a decision-maker must give a reasoned judgment so as to enable an affected individual to decide whether to appeal.|$|E

25|$|For {{a hearing}} to be fair, {{the person who}} will be {{affected}} by the hearing's outcome must be given sufficient notice to allow him or her to adequately prepare his or her case; he or she must be entitled to know what evidence has been produced against him or her; and that there must be a proper opportunity to contest, contradict or correct any evidence, state one's case and raise relevant matters before the court.

25|$|Although {{the common}} law {{provides}} no explicit statement of rights in a legal process, a number of principles combine to guarantee an individual {{a certain level of}} protection by law. These are often known as the rules of natural justice and comprise the principles nemo iudex in causa sua and audi alteram partem. <b>A</b> <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> implies that each party has the opportunity to present their own case to an impartial tribunal. Courts must generally sit in public and decisions may be challenged on the grounds of actual or apparent bias. Although judges are under a common law duty to give reasons for their decisions, there is no such rule for non-judicial decision-makers.|$|E
25|$|In late October 2009 Turner {{was freed}} on $500,000 bond, and was ordered {{not to use}} a {{computer}} or any device that can access the Internet. His trial started on November 30, 2009 and ended on December 4, 2009, with the defense opting not to call any witnesses. After two hours of deliberation, the jury announced it was deadlocked. Three days later the judge declared a mistrial, and a retrial was set for March 1, 2010. This second trial, overseen by Western District of Louisiana judge Donald Walter, was moved from the Northern District of Illinois to the Eastern District of New York: since the prosecution was to call the three judges to the stand, the defense felt that Turner would not get <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> if the trial was conducted {{in the same city}} where the judges worked.

Melanchthon and Johannes Brenz, with some other German Lutherans, actually started in 1552 on the journey to Trento. Brenz offered a confession and Melanchthon, who got no farther than Nuremberg, took with him the Confessio Saxonica. But the refusal to give the Protestants the right to vote and the consternation produced by the success of Maurice in his campaign against Charles V in 1552 effectually put an end to Protestant cooperation.|$|E

25|$|Pye was {{commander}} of the station until his replacement, Commodore Thomas Frankland, arrived to supersede him in October 1755. Pye, reportedly angry at this, refused to strike his broad pennant, upon which Frankland reprimanded him for disobeying a superior officer. Frankland brought various other charges against Pye, accusing him of 'financial irregularities, interfering with the purchase of naval stores...', and with having damaged Advice by '...removing parts of her timbers for an unnecessary survey.' Claiming {{that he would not}} be able to receive <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> in the Caribbean, Pye instead returned to Britain, causing a bureaucratic quandary as since he should have been tried there, the Admiralty officials for a time did nothing. They eventually convened a court martial from 1 to 4 March 1748, but the senior naval officers at the time, Lord Anson and Edward Boscawen were at sea and could not be present. Pye used his political connections again to his advantage, putting pressure on the civilian members of the board, and while he was duly reprimanded for the lesser charges Frankland brought, he was not charged with disobeying his superior.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Soros was {{contacted}} by a French financier named Georges Pébereau who {{asked him to}} participate in an effort to assemble a group of investors to purchase a large number of shares in Société Générale, a leading French bank that was part of a privatization program (something instituted by the new government under Jacques Chirac). Soros eventually decided against participating in the group effort opting to personally move forward with his strategy of accumulating shares in four French companies: Société Générale, as well as Suez, Paribas, and the Compagnie Générale d'Électricité. In 1989, the Commission des Opérations de Bourse (COB—the French stock exchange regulatory authority) conducted an investigation of whether Soros's transaction in Société Générale should be considered insider trading. Soros had received no information from the Société Générale and had no insider knowledge of the business, but he did possess knowledge that a group of investors was planning a takeover attempt. Initial investigations found Soros innocent and no charges were brought forward, however, the case was reopened a few years later and the French Supreme Court confirmed the conviction on June 14, 2006, but reduced the penalty to €940,000. Soros denied any wrongdoing, saying news of the takeover was public knowledge and it was documented that his intent to acquire shares of the company predated his own awareness of the takeover. In December 2006 he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on various grounds including that the 14-year delay in bringing the case to trial precluded <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>hearing.</b> On the basis of Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights, stating that no person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offense at the time that it was committed, the court agreed to hear the appeal. In October 2011, the court rejected his appeal in a 4–3 decision, saying that Soros had been aware of the risk of breaking insider trading laws.|$|E
