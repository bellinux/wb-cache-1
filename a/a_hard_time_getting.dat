5|$|River {{dolphins}} have {{a relatively}} thin layer of blubber. Blubber can help with buoyancy, protection from predators (they would have <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> through {{a thick layer of}} fat), energy for leaner times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs.|$|E
5|$|Several years earlier, Alaska {{politicians}} had {{speculated that}} Gravel would have <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> both renominated and elected when {{his first term}} expired, given that he was originally elected without a base party organization and {{tended to focus on}} national rather than local issues.|$|E
5|$|At {{various times}} during the program, NASA {{managers}} and personnel found themselves limited in terms of resources and manpower, particularly as Phase Two geared up, and had <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> anywhere with NASA administration. One particular area of contention was with crew assignments to missions. Many astronauts allege that the method of selection prevented the most skilled people from performing roles they were best-suited for.|$|E
50|$|The {{bill passed}} {{by a vote of}} 108-11. As of June 8, the state Senate was {{expected}} to consider the bill the following week, but the bill, according to news reports, would face <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> passed in the state Senate. Gov. Roy Cooper has said he supports the legislation.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to undergoing the regular licensing process as required of all Canadian medical school graduates, IMGs must pass the LMCC Evaluating Examination. IMGs in Canada also have <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> into residency programs compared to Canadian graduates [...] - [...] only {{ten percent of}} IMG applicants get a position.|$|R
50|$|The key {{struggle}} {{is the relationship}} of the two men to Martha. Yorick develops a relationship with Martha quickly. Ondrej, a virgin, has <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> close to Martha, not withstanding prodding by Yorick. In an odd move, Yorick has himself arrested and is sent to jail for a year during which time Martha and Ondrej's relationship develops.|$|R
5|$|All whales have a {{thick layer}} of blubber. In species that live near the poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches. This blubber can help with {{buoyancy}} (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators would have <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> through {{a thick layer}} of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E
5|$|Odontocetes possess {{teeth with}} {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of}} the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have a thick layer of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators would have <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with a covering of fine, downy hair known as lanugo.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} begins {{nine months after}} the pilot episode. After Pete and Jenny's baby is born in Episode 1, the couple have <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> any sleep. Pete has {{to cope with the}} death of his father in Episode 4. Adam and Rachel decide to rent a house together. He is horrified to {{discover}} in Episode 2 that she is married to another man. While he is staying with Pete and Jenny, Rachel has sex with her visiting husband (Lennie James)—who leaves soon after—and is pregnant by Episode 6. Just as hers and Adam's relationship is recovering, she tells him that he might not be the father, and that she is moving to London until the birth. Karen and David have recently hired Ramona as a nanny to their young son Josh. At her publishing job, Karen edits the novel of a renowned author (Denis Lawson), whom she becomes attracted to. She plans to sleep with him on a book tour but is humiliated when she finds out he is not attracted to her. David tries to sleep with Ramona to get back at Karen, which causes friction between the couple. They seek guidance counselling to repair their marriage.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{believe that}} the doors were small so prisoners would have <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> out, {{minimizing}} <b>an</b> attack on a security guard. Others have explained the small doors forced the prisoners to bow while entering their cell. This design is related to penance and ties to the religious inspiration of the prison. The cells were made of concrete with a single glass skylight, representing the [...] "Eye of God", suggesting to the prisoners that God was always watching them.|$|R
5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} start {{painting}} her mural in the warehouse, but has <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> started {{as she is}} afraid of it not being perfect. Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the complaints {{are already in the}} computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses them to build a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper meaning for the employees when Pete points out that it is composed of failures made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that they should not be ashamed of their failures. They decide {{to try to make it}} go all the way to the ceiling, but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a blank card as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and hangs up. The client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over getting that last complaint and disappointed over losing a client. After celebrating the completion of the card tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what others think, further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E
25|$|All {{dolphins}} have a {{thick layer}} of blubber, thickness varying on climate. This blubber can help with buoyancy, protection to some extent as predators would have <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> through {{a thick layer}} of fat, and energy for leaner times; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. Calves, generally, are born with a thin layer of blubber, which develops at different paces depending on the habitat.|$|E
25|$|Much {{consolidation}} {{occurred in}} the financial services industry since, {{but not at the}} scale some had expected. Retail banks, for example, do not tend to buy insurance underwriters, as they seek to engage in a more profitable business of insurance brokerage by selling products of other insurance companies. Other retail banks were slow to market investments and insurance products and package those products in a convincing way. Brokerage companies had <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> into banking, because {{they do not have a}} large branch and backshop footprint. Banks have recently tended to buy other banks, such as the 2004 Bank of America and Fleet Boston merger, yet they have had less success integrating with investment and insurance companies. Many banks have expanded into investment banking, but have found it hard to package it with their banking services, without resorting to questionable tie-ins which caused scandals at Smith Barney.|$|E
50|$|The Knicks had <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> to {{the playoffs}} than the Spurs did. Toward {{the end of the}} season, with the team teetering on the brink of making the playoffs, rumors had begun to spread in the New York media that head coach Jeff Van Gundy would lose his job {{before the end of the}} season if the team did not make the playoffs. Instead, New York fired general manager Ernie Grunfeld and allowed Van Gundy to lead the team {{to the playoffs}}, with the team barely {{qualifying}} as the #8 seed. They would face the Miami Heat, the top seed, in the first round.|$|R
50|$|The {{flotilla}} {{finally arrived}} at Hamilton, Bermuda, on 9 November 1917. When Margarets dory was sent for caulking material ashore, it {{broke down and}} had to towed in. Margarets low priority for logistical support meant that her crew had <b>a</b> very <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> anything there that they needed for repairs.|$|R
50|$|In general, {{women have}} lower {{personal}} financial assets than men. This means {{that for a}} given opportunity and equally capable individual, women must secure additional resources compared to men in order to exploit the opportunity; because, they control less capital. The question of whether women have <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> finance than men for the same business opportunity has developed into its own sub-field. One possible issue in raising outside capital is that 96% of senior venture capitalists are men {{and may not be}} as understanding of female-centric businesses. However, the situation seems to be improving. A study by Babson College showed that in 1999, fewer than 5% of venture capital investments went to companies with a woman on the executive team. In 2011, it was 9% and in 2013 it had jumped to 18%.|$|R
25|$|In the post-SummerSlam wedding reception, Roberts {{and his new}} ally, The Undertaker, {{made their}} {{presence}} known by hiding a live snake {{in one of the}} newly married couple's wedding presents; Elizabeth was frightened when she opened the gift box, and the Undertaker blindsided Savage by knocking him out with the urn. Sid Justice ran off both Roberts and The Undertaker. Savage, still unable to compete due to his WrestleMania VII loss to the Ultimate Warrior, immediately began a public campaign to have himself reinstated as an active wrestler to gain revenge on Roberts; however, WWF President Jack Tunney refused. Meanwhile, Roberts cut a series of promos berating Savage. The feud began to boil over during a television taping for WWF Superstars of Wrestling October 21 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, when Roberts cut an in-ring promo to goad Savage – who was providing TV commentary – into the ring. After he was lured into the ring, Roberts attacked Savage, eventually tying Savage into the ropes before getting a live king cobra to bite his arm, according to Hulk Hogan and Jake Roberts on the Pick Your Poison DVD that the snake was holding on with the fangs and that Jake had <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> the snake off Randy. Sid Justice was originally supposed to be the victim of the snake bite, but due to a biceps injury, Savage accepted to be snake bitten.|$|E
500|$|Tot Mitică offers other glimpses {{into the}} character's {{financial}} problems, showing him complaining {{that he has}} been [...] "pulling the devil's tail"—using a traditional proverb to indicate that he has had <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> by. To this, he adds that the devil would be suing him for injuries. He claims {{that he is going to}} spend his vacation in the mountains, and elaborates that he is talking about the pawnbroking institution known as muntele de pietate (from the French for [...] "Mountain of Piety"; see Mont de Piété). Mitică enters a restaurant to order only things which he knows are free ("a toothpick, a match, a glass of water and a newspaper"). In other such sequences of events, he is shown eating in a pub as a means to [...] "defend himself from death", and borrowing money which he promises not to return.|$|E
500|$|Scouts for the {{professional}} football teams described Walker as a [...] "Big physical receiver, who uses his size to muscle {{the ball away}} from defenders...Lacks explosive speed, but has exceptional body control and balance." [...] In another scouting report he {{was described as a}} [...] "Striding-type runner who is not quick or sudden. Dominates average defensive backs but has <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> separation vs. a good corner" [...] In direct questioning during interviews, Walker confessed that he never had run a 40-yard dash and did not practice straight line speed. Thus, there was some consensus {{that he did not have}} the speed to play wide receiver in the National Football League and that he did not work on his speed. It was also said that he [...] "Lacks soft hands and will do a lot of double-catching and body-catching. Has a lot of drops for a featured No. 1 receiver." ...|$|E

50|$|Following the Civil War, 90 {{percent of}} the bottomlands in Mississippi were still undeveloped. The state {{attracted}} thousands of migrants to its frontier. They could trade their labor in clearing the land to eventually purchase it from their sale of lumber. Tens of thousands of new settlers, both black and white, were drawn to the area. By {{the end of the}} century, two-thirds of the independent farmers in the Mississippi Delta were black. But, the extended low price of cotton had caused many to go deeply into debt, and gradually they had to sell off their lands, as they had <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> credit than did white farmers. From 1910 to 1920, the first and second generations of African Americans after slavery lost their stake in the land. They had to resort to sharecropping and tenant farming to survive.|$|R

Eventually, however, they become good friends.|$|R

2500|$|The {{ending of}} the fight {{remains one of the}} most {{controversial}} in boxing history. Midway through the first round, Liston threw a left jab and Ali went over it with a fast right, knocking the former champion down. Liston went down on his back. He rolled over, got to his right knee and then fell on his back again. Many in attendance did not see Ali deliver the punch. The fight quickly descended into chaos. Referee Jersey Joe Walcott, a former World Heavyweight Champion himself, had <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> Ali to go to a neutral corner. Ali initially stood over his fallen opponent, gesturing and yelling at him, [...] "Get up and fight, sucker!" [...] "Nobody will believe this!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Unemployment reached 25 {{percent in}} the worst days of 1932–33, but it was {{unevenly}} distributed. Job losses were [...] less severe among women than men, among workers in nondurable industries (such as food and clothing), in services and sales, and in government jobs. The least skilled inner city men had much higher unemployment rates, as did young people who had <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> their first job, and men {{over the age of}} 45 who if they lost their job would seldom find another one because employers had their choice of younger men. Millions were hired in the Great Depression, but men with weaker credentials were never hired, and fell into a long-term unemployment trap. The migration that brought millions of farmers and townspeople to the bigger cities in the 1920s suddenly reversed itself, as unemployment made the cities unattractive, and the network of kinfolk and more ample food supplies made it wise for many to go back.|$|E

[...] City governments in 1930-31 tried to meet the depression by expanding public works projects, as president Herbert Hoover strongly encouraged. However, tax revenues were plunging, and the cities as well as private relief agencies were totally overwhelmed by 1931; no one was able to provide significant additional relief. People fell back on the cheapest possible relief, soup kitchens which provided free meals for anyone who showed up. After 1933 new sales taxes and infusions of federal money helped relieve the fiscal distress of the cities, but the budgets did not fully recover until 1941.|$|E
50|$|Fire & Ice {{was first}} {{announced}} on June 9, 2015. Sega producer Omar Woodley has stated both Sega and developer Sanzaru Games have been learning from their mistakes with Shattered Crystal, which received mostly negative reviews upon release.

As such, levels have been made shorter and include paths to better suit gamers who prefer speeding through levels, in addition to explorational elements. On September 15, 2015, Sega announced that Fire & Ice which was planned for a release in Fall 2015, would be delayed to 2016 to allow more development time and coincide with the series' 25th anniversary.
