50|$|The T90 was {{the first}} Canon camera to support through-the-lens (<b>TTL)</b> flash <b>metering.</b> This <b>measures</b> the actual light levels {{reaching}} the film by measuring reflected light off the film (OTF), shutting down the flash unit once the film is sufficiently exposed. The measurement is calculated using the average reflectivity of color negative film. This system is also used on Canon's new EOS system, making the T90 the only non-EOS Canon body compatible with TTL Canon flashes. The T90's X-sync speed of 1/250 second was the fastest Canon had achieved and is better than most other cameras {{available at the time}} it was in production.|$|R
5000|$|<b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> {{systems have}} been {{incorporated}} into other types of cameras as well. Most digital [...] "point-and-shoot cameras" [...] use <b>TTL</b> <b>metering,</b> performed by the imaging sensor itself.|$|R

5000|$|In 1968, Leitz {{responded to}} the critics of the non-TTL meter of the {{original}} Leicaflex by introducing its successor the Leicaflex SL with a <b>TTL</b> <b>meter.</b> The SL designation in the name was an abbreviation of [...] "Selective Light", the name chosen by Leitz for its implementation of <b>TTL</b> <b>metering.</b> This system metered a limited area represented by the viewfinder's central microprism spot. At a time when SLR manufacturers were divided between those embracing <b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> at full aperture (such as Nikon and Konica), and those with mounts which permitted only stop-down metering (such as Pentax and Canon), Leitz chose to implement full aperture metering on the Leicaflex SL.|$|R
50|$|Afterwards, late 1966, the SR-T {{series was}} introduced. These cameras now had <b>TTL</b> <b>metering,</b> which Minolta called the Contrast Light Compensator (CLC).|$|R
50|$|The Konica FP-1, {{introduced}} in 1981 and discontinued in 1983, was a 35mm SLR camera with <b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> {{and a large}} range of exchangeable optics.|$|R
50|$|In photography, through-the-lens (<b>TTL)</b> <b>metering</b> {{refers to}} a feature of cameras whereby the {{intensity}} of light reflected from the scene is measured through the lens; as opposed to using a separate metering window or external hand-held light meter. In some cameras various <b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> modes can be selected. This information can then be used to set the optimal film or image sensor exposure (average luminance), {{it can also be}} used to control the amount of light emitted by a flash unit connected to the camera.|$|R
50|$|FT QL was {{introduced}} in March 1966, {{a year after the}} pellicle mirrored Canon Pellix. However it differs from the Pellix models, having a normal quick-return reflex mirror and offering stop-down <b>TTL</b> <b>metering.</b> The <b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> is semi-spot in nature and works through a prism incorporated in the viewfinder condenser/screen assembly. The later Canon F-1 has a similar prism for metering in its removable screen. The Canon FT viewfinder screen is not user changeable. The pentaprism finder is fixed like the similar FX and FP models but unlike some earlier Canon R reflexes.|$|R
50|$|Petri TTL was {{a manual}} 35 mm SLR camera with <b>TTL</b> <b>metering.</b> It {{was built by}} Petri Camera Company, Japan, from 1974. It is unknown when the {{production}} stopped.|$|R
50|$|The Autoreflex T was {{the first}} focal plane shutter 35mm SLRs with auto-exposure and <b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> {{combined}} in one body. In Japan it was sold as FTA, in Germany as Revue Autoreflex TTL.|$|R
50|$|The manual {{settings}} {{which the}} s5200 featured allow much {{control over the}} image, such settings like <b>TTL</b> <b>metering,</b> ISO, flash, Macro, White Balance and Red Eye Reduction could be manipulated to produce impressive images.|$|R
5000|$|... 1968: Konica Autoreflex T (Japan): first SLR with {{internal}} open aperture <b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> autoexposure (mechanical shutter-priority). Was an improved Konica AutoReflex (see above) {{with internal}} CdS centerweighted light meter and reduced shutter button travel, but without half frame capability.|$|R
5000|$|The F60 {{body was}} made from {{polycarbonate}} and metal, and available in both [...] "champagne silver" [...] and black. It features compatibility with most older Nikkor F-mount lenses, except AFS and pre-AI lenses. However, in some cases autofocus and/or <b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> is not supported.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{features}} {{found on}} many SLR cameras include through-the-lens (<b>TTL)</b> <b>metering</b> and sophisticated flash control {{referred to as}} [...] "dedicated electronic flash". In a dedicated system, once the dedicated electronic flash is inserted into the camera's hot shoe and turned on, there is then communication between camera and flash. The camera's synchronization speed is set, along with the aperture. Many camera models measure the light that reflects off of the film plane, which controls the flash duration of the electronic flash. This is denoted <b>TTL</b> flash <b>metering.</b>|$|R
50|$|For the Auto-Reflex, {{the meter}} sensor {{is mounted on}} the front, {{right-hand}} side of the camera. This is not <b>TTL</b> <b>metering,</b> although it does offer a shutter-preferred, auto-exposure mode. TTL auto exposure appeared in a Konica a few years later, with the Autoreflex T (FTA in Japan).|$|R
5000|$|The Leica M5 is a 35 mm camera by Leica Camera AG, {{introduced}} in 1971. It {{was the first}} Leica rangefinder camera to feature through-the-lens (<b>TTL)</b> <b>metering</b> and the last to be made entirely in Wetzlar by hand using the traditional [...] "adjust and fit" [...] method.|$|R
5000|$|The F-401 {{introduced}} the now common-place feature {{of using a}} thumbwheel instead of lens aperture ring to adjust the aperture. Furthermore, the camera's lack of support for AI lenses meant that while all previous Nikon lenses could be mounted to the camera, none supported automatic exposure <b>TTL</b> <b>metering.</b>|$|R
5000|$|CL - 1973-76 (the compact Leica). Leitz Minolta CL, {{introduced}} {{with two}} lenses special to that model: the 40 mm Summicron-C f2 and 90 mm Elmar-C f4. Internal metering {{similar to the}} M5 - CDS cell on a swinging stalk. The CL is also notable for being the only M-bayonet camera to have a vertically travelling shutter. Minolta later manufactured and sold an improved electronic version, the Minolta CLE with Auto Exposure, Off-The-Film <b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> and <b>TTL</b> Flash <b>metering,</b> together with three M-Rokkor lenses, the 40 mm/f2, 28 mm/f2.8 and 90 mm/f4.|$|R
50|$|The {{design is}} based on the {{innovative}} Minolta SR-7 model V camera of 1962, but the principal design is inherited from the original 1958 Minolta SR-2. The SR-T 101 however, has several significant features apart from the <b>TTL</b> <b>meter.</b> The most significant one is perhaps the full aperture metering facility, automatically compensating for the at any time fitted lens' maximum aperture, a feature it took twelve more years for Nikon to accomplish. Full aperture <b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> was commercially first realised in the brilliant Tokyo Kogaku Topcon RE Super, a feature first realised in a screw mount camera by the introduction of the Olympus Kogaku Olympus FTL, their first full frame 35mm SLR in 1971, but which was abandoned one year later in favour of the remarkable OM system.|$|R
5000|$|... 2 cam lenses {{have two}} sloped cams for the Leicaflex SL and SL2 with <b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> and are fully {{compatible}} with the original Leicaflex. They {{can be used on}} R series cameras with the same limitation and warning as 1 cam lenses and may also be fitted with later cams.|$|R
50|$|Metering {{is through}} the lens. Camera also {{features}} direct <b>TTL</b> flash <b>metering.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many other {{manufacturers}} attempted {{to capitalize on}} the popularity of the Instamatic with their own 126 cameras, including Canon, Olympus, Minolta, Ricoh, Zeiss Ikon, and even Rollei. Some of these models were far more sophisticated and expensive than the Kodak cameras: the Rollei SL26, for instance, featured interchangeable lenses, <b>TTL</b> <b>metering,</b> and a rangefinder, and retailed for $300.|$|R
50|$|Most SLR cameras {{would at}} this time be fully manual, with an option of using one or more {{automatic}} exposure modes. The FP-1 was basically a point-and-shoot camera, like most viewfinder cameras, but {{with the benefit of}} <b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> and exchangeable lenses. A similar camera, for the same entry-level user group, is the later Canon T-50.|$|R
50|$|In most {{film and}} digital SLRs, the light sensor(s) for {{exposure}} metering {{are incorporated into}} the pentaprism or pentamirror, the mechanism by which a SLR allows the viewfinder to see directly through the lens. As the mirror is flipped up, no light can reach there during exposure, the necessary amount of exposure needs to be determined before the actual exposure. Consequently, these light sensors could traditionally be used for ambient light <b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> only. In newer SLRs {{as well as in}} almost all DSLRs, they can also be utilized for preflash <b>TTL</b> <b>metering,</b> where the metering is carried out before the mirror flips up using a small preflash of known intensity and the necessary amount of flash light is extrapolated from the reflected flash light <b>measured</b> by the <b>metering</b> cells in the roof of the camera and is then applied during the exposure without any possible real-time feedback.|$|R
5000|$|... 1964: Asahi (Honeywell in USA) Pentax Spotmatic (Japan): second SLR with coupled center-the-needle <b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> (stop-down aperture, full area averaging). Well-integrated, {{compact and}} {{reliable}} focal-plane shutter, instant return mirror and pentaprism design with excellent non-auto-diaphragm interchangeable lenses. Although the Spotmatic's stop-down (manual diaphragm lenses) system was less convenient than the RE Super's open aperture (auto-diaphragm lenses) system, the Spotmatic's two CdS cells {{on either side}} of the eyepiece reading off the focusing screen was less expensive and complex than the RE Super's system (see above), and thereby more popular. The Spotmatic's TTL system was (and is) very influential and widely imitated, often with open aperture. It (and rival <b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> SLRs, including the Canon FT stop-down aperture, partial area, Minolta SRT101 open aperture, modified centerweighted and Nikkormat FTN open aperture, centerweighted; all from Japan) made the Japanese 35 mm SLR the dominant advanced amateur camera by the late 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Aperture {{priority}} mode (commonly abbreviated to Av) gives the photographer manual {{control of the}} aperture, whilst the camera automatically adjusts the shutter speed to achieve the exposure specified by the <b>TTL</b> <b>meter.</b> Shutter {{priority mode}} (commonly abbreviated to TV) gives manual shutter control, with automatic aperture compensation. In each case, the actual exposure level is still determined by the camera's exposure meter.|$|R
50|$|The Bessa-L has <b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> with LED readout on {{the back}} edge of the top plate with an ASA range of 25-1600 and an EV range 1 to 19 at ASA 100. The readout {{consists}} of two red arrows pointing to a green light in between that enables use of the camera as, effectively, a shutter priority, aperture priority, or totally manual camera.|$|R
50|$|The F90 is {{the first}} camera to support 3D <b>TTL</b> flash <b>metering</b> with D lenses.|$|R
5000|$|The Praktica EE2 was an {{important}} innovation of the 2-L generation. It was a camera with [...] "fully electronic, full aperture <b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> SLR" [...] or [...] "camera-computer". This camera had an electronic time control between 1 sec and 1/1000s and electronic aperture simulation. These cameras were used in space on board of Salut 6 in September 1978 by Bykowsky (USSR) and Jähn (GDR).|$|R
5000|$|A second {{viewfinder}} {{line was}} Nikon's complete re-design and included a through-the-lens (<b>TTL)</b> light <b>meter</b> with automatic exposure: ...|$|R
5000|$|SR - The SR camera {{models from}} 1958 to 1967 {{features}} the initial design {{implementation of the}} SR bayonet, beginning with the Minolta SR-2. These are mechanical cameras without <b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> or automatic exposure. The 1962 Minolta SR-7 was the first 35mm SLR with a built-in CdS meter, providing the same metering capabilities as the external clip-on meter available for the 1960 Minolta SR-3 and later models of the Minolta SR-1.|$|R
50|$|The camera {{provides}} automatic exposuremetering in {{aperture priority}} auto-exposure or programmed exposure modes (with AE lockand +/-2EV exposure compensation) or exposure can be manually set(with exposure metering still available). Light is metered through a sensor {{on the front}} ofthe camera body rather than using <b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> or a sensor inside thefilter ring. This means that manual camera settings (ISO value orexposure compensation) must be used to account for light reduction due to any filter fitted.|$|R
50|$|The Genesis IV {{featured}} ergonomical {{styling and}} most functions were automated. It had a fixed (i.e., non-interchangeable) motorized 38-135mm (f/4.0-5.6) autofocus zoom lens, a built-in flash with a red-eye reduction mode, <b>TTL</b> <b>metering,</b> an LCD status panel, and a fully automatic film-transport system. The lens accepted standard screw-on 58mm filters. An Optional 0.8x wide angle or 1.4x teleside converter could be fitted {{in front of}} the lens, and Chinon also offered external flash units.|$|R
5000|$|... 1981: Implementation of Minolta's {{invention}} and patent of TTL (through-the-lens) OTF (off-the-film) exposure metering: the Minolta CLE {{is the first}} 35mm rangefinder camera to feature <b>TTL</b> <b>metering</b> and aperture priority autoexposure. The Minolta X-700 manual-focus SLR is introduced; this model is sold until 1999 and is enormously successful. The Minolta XD-11 (Model E) is the first Minolta product branded with an updated logo (in caps), which was in use until the 2003 merger with Konica.|$|R
50|$|Some early Pentax DSLRs {{could use}} this same {{configuration}} for <b>TTL</b> flash <b>metering</b> as well, {{but since the}} reflectance properties of image sensors differ significantly from those of film, this method proved to be unreliable in practice. Therefore, digital SLR cameras typically don't support any real-time <b>TTL</b> flash <b>metering</b> and must use preflash metering instead. The ambient and flash light metering is then carried out by a metering module located in {{the roof of the}} camera (see above).|$|R
