40|$|Population {{fluctuations}} {{of various}} species ofDrosophila in the 5 localities of Bababudangiri and Kemmangundi Hill ranges (Western Ghats) were analysed {{with reference to}} the seasons of the year. The radical changes in the environmental factors caused by the alterations of seasons were found to influence greatly the size ofDrosophila populations. The quantitative differences in the monthly collections ofDrosophila species such asD. giriensis, D. takahashii, D. mysorensis, D. nasuta andD. immigrans were found to be closely related to the climatic variations. The differential magnitude of the population peaks and their <b>asynchronous</b> <b>formation</b> by different species as observed {{in the present study were}} found to be a reflection of differential responses of these species to the ambient and changing ecological factors. The cyclical changes in the size ofDrosophila populations under study appears to be regulated by the seasonal rainfall and the related changes in the environment (extrinsic factors) coupled with genetic and physiological factors (intrinsic factors) generated within the populations...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of oocytes showing only one pronucleus during assisted reproduction {{is associated with}} uncertainty. A compilation of data on the genetic constitution of different developmental stages shows that affected oocytes are able to develop into haploid, diploid, and mosaic embryos with more or less complex chromosomal compositions. In {{the majority of cases}} (~ 80 %), haploidy appears to be caused by gynogenesis, whereas parthenogenesis or androgenesis is less common. Most of the diploid embryos result from a fertilization event involving <b>asynchronous</b> <b>formation</b> of the two pronuclei or pronuclear fusion at a very early stage. Uniparental diploidy may sometimes occur if one pronucleus fails to develop and the other pronucleus already contains a diploid genome or alternatively a haploid genome undergoes endoreduplication. In general, the chance of obtaining a biparental diploid embryo appears higher after conventional in vitro fertilization than after intracytoplasmic sperm injection. If a transfer of embryos obtained from monopronuclear oocytes is envisaged, it should be tried to culture them up to the blastocyst since most haploid embryos are not able to reach this stage. Comprehensive counselling of patients on potential risks is advisable before transfer and a preimplantation genetic diagnosis could be offered if available...|$|E
40|$|Taking the London {{text of the}} English {{literature}} as an example, {{the author of the}} present article points out the <b>asynchronous</b> <b>formation</b> of the fundamental texts of a particular culture by its representatives and the representatives of other cultures. This results in the latter sharing false stereotypes and myths about the source culture and causes translation difficulties. The article looks into the causes of such asynchronous conceptualization of the real world – in particular, translating written sources required for the formation of the literary canon and supertexts constructed on its basis takes time, and one cannot be sure that the translated sources will appear equally wide-spread in the target culture. The article also studies the ideal images of London peculiar to the London texts of nonEnglish literatures. However, the article does not postulate the non-conceivable nature of the supertexts of another culture, but rather points out certain difficulties in their reconstruction, which is achieved via stepby-step assimilation of foreign literary traditions and models. Along with this, the article dwells on the principal constituents of Englishness, which is viewed through the prism of London as the civilizationforming factor.   </p...|$|E

The objective of this report is to show the <b>asynchronous</b> wood <b>formation</b> from the observation of indistinct, ring-like structures. YoungAcacia mangium planted in Malaysia was investigated for <b>asynchronous</b> wood <b>formation</b> anatomically and macroscopically. Tree heights and girths at breast height for 28 trees were measured every other week. Wood disks from four trees were sampled at breast height for this research. The radial variation of vessel dimensions {{and the number of}} cambial cells in different radial directions and the wood anatomy of discontinuous bands were investigated using thin sectioning and soft radiographic methods. The vessel dimension was quite different in their radial variation even for four radial directions with a similar radius. There was a large variation in the number of cambial cells among radial directions in youngAcacia mangium. Bands of low density included a layer of vessels aligned in a spiral rather than in a closed circle.|$|R

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: The CapD enzyme of Bacillus anthracis is a γ-glutamyl {{transpeptidase}} {{from the}} N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase superfamily that covalently anchors the poly-γ-D-glutamic acid (pDGA) capsule to the peptidoglycan. The capsule hinders phagocytosis of B. anthracis by host cells and {{is essential for}} virulence. The role CapD plays in capsule anchoring and remodeling makes the enzyme a promising target for anthrax medical countermeasures. Although the structure of CapD is known, and a covalent inhibitor, capsidin, has been identified, the mechanisms of CapD catalysis and inhibition are poorly understood. Here, we used a computational approach to map out the reaction steps involved in CapD catalysis and inhibition. We found that the rate-limiting step of either CapD catalysis or inhibition was a concerted <b>asynchronous</b> <b>formation</b> of the tetrahedral intermediate with a barrier of 22 − 23 kcal/mol. However, the mechanisms of these reactions differed for the two amides. The formation of the tetrahedral intermediate with pDGA was substrate-assisted with two proton transfers. In contrast, capsidin formed the tetrahedral intermediate in a conventional way with one proton transfer. Interestingly, capsidin coupled a conformational change in the catalytic residue of the tetrahedral intermediate to stretching of the scissile amide bond. Furthermore, capsidin took advantage of iminol−amide tautomerism of its diacetamide moiety to convert the tetrahedral intermediate to the acetylated CapD. As evidence of the promiscuous nature of CapD, the enzyme cleaved the amide bond of capsidin by attacking it {{on the opposite side}} compared to pDGA...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{history of}} the {{peneplain}} in East Sayan was studied using apatite fission-track analysis (AFTA). This method is suitable for determining the formation time of the erosional surface and estimating its denudation rate. The largest known relic of the peneplanation surface {{in this area is}} the Oka Plateau, separated from the Kropotkin Ridge by the Oka-Jombolok fault. The AFTA shows that the peneplain on the Oka Plateau formed in the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous. This peneplain is much younger than the erosional surfaces that persist today in the Tien Shan, Gobi Altai, and Mongolian Altai (Early Jurassic). However, it is older than the peneplain on the Chulyshman Plateau, Altai (Late Cretaceous), suggesting <b>asynchronous</b> <b>formation</b> of the ancient peneplain in Central Asia. The similar exhumation histories of samples from the Oka Plateau and Kropotkin Ridge indicate that these morphotectonic structures developed from Jurassic to late Miocene as a single block, which underwent continuous slow denudation at an average rate of 0. 0175 mm/yr. Active tectonic processes in the Late Miocene caused the destruction of the peneplanation surface and its partial uplifting to different altitudes. The rate of Pliocene-Quaternary vertical movements along the Oka-Jombolok fault is roughly estimated at 0. 046 - 0. 080 mm/yr, which is several times higher than the denudation rate in this area. During the Pliocene-Quaternary, the Oka Plateau has not undergone any significant morphologic changes owing to its intermediate position between the summit plain and datum surface of East Sayan and to its partial shielding by basaltic lavas...|$|E

Snail genes participate in both these processes and, {{although they are}} expressed symmetrically in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), Snail 1 transcripts are asymmetrically distributed in the L–R lateral mesoderm. We show that the alteration of the symmetric Snail expression in the PSM induces <b>asynchronous</b> somite <b>formation.</b> Furthermore, {{in the absence of}} RA signalling, normal asymmetric Snail 1 expression in the lateral mesoderm is extended to the PSM, desynchronizing somitogenesis. Thus, Snail 1 is the first cue corrected by RA in the PSM to ensure synchronized bilateral segmentation...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of γ-glutamylhydroxamate by homogenates under optimum assay condition showed an inconstancy in {{the ratios of}} the enzyme activities utilizing l-glutamate and ATP (γ-glutamylhydroxamate synthetase) and l-glutamine and ADP (l-glutamine–hydroxylamine glutamyltransferase) {{in a number of}} normal and neoplastic rat tissues. Although γ-glutamylhydroxamate synthetase activities in adult livers and kidneys were identical in males and females, l-glutamine–hydroxylamine glutamyltransferase activities in the organs of females were significantly lower. The developmental formations of the two activities in liver, kidney, brain and muscle were not simultaneous. The l-glutamine–hydroxylamine glutamyltransferase activity in foetal liver or neonatal kidney could be prematurely evoked by thyroxine, but the γ-glutamylhydroxamate synthetase activity remained unchanged. Injections of cortisol also had dissimilar effects on the two activities in thymus and hepatomas.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{synoptic}} map assimilation {{has been developed}} to study global rearrangements of open magnetic flux and formation of polar coronal holes (PCHs) in the current cycle. The analysis reveals ensembles of coronal holes (ECHs) which appear within unipolar magnetic regions associated with decaying activity complexes (ACs). The cause-effect relations between them explain <b>asynchronous</b> PCH <b>formation</b> observed at {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres of the Sun. Thus, the decay of large ACs, that were observed in 2014, led to formation of an extensive ECH, which then became the south PCH in mid- 2015.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} decade, {{the design of}} {{collaborative}} discovery learning environments (CDLE's) has received increasing attention. Such a design perspective brings up to the educational context the possibility of exploiting the so-called Model-Based Reasoning approach, by providing to learners the opportunity of collaborating while building models to represent observations. In this paper, we {{are concerned with the}} design of CDLE's in which building models instantiates as a theory formation process. Such a process is provided as a synergetic combination of both inductive and hypothetical-deductive approaches. The “moving engine” allowing a theory to evolve is the notion of contradiction: learning is supposed to occur as a side effect of contradiction detection and overcoming during theory formation by learners guided by a coordinator. Inspired in recent relevant work concerning Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) architectures, we propose an architecture to support the process of <b>asynchronous</b> theory <b>formation,</b> allowing a student both to work individually and to contribute to the group discussion. Out of the proposed architecture, we draw-up related questions that would address supporting a coordinator to guide discussions on the basis of group interaction analysis...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss how}} {{contemporary}} multiwavelength observations of young OB-dominated clusters address long-standing astrophysical questions: Do clusters form rapidly or slowly with an age spread? When do clusters expand and disperse to constitute the field star population? Do rich clusters form by amalgamation of smaller subclusters? What is the pattern {{and duration of}} cluster formation in massive star forming regions (MSFRs) ? Past observational difficulties in obtaining good stellar censuses of MSFRs have been alleviated in recent studies that combine X-ray and infrared surveys to obtain rich, though still incomplete, censuses of young stars in MSFRs. We describe here one of these efforts, the MYStIX project, that produced a catalog of 31, 784 probable members of 20 MSFRs. We find that age spread within clusters are real {{in the sense that}} the stars in the core formed after the cluster halo. Cluster expansion is seen in the ensemble of (sub) clusters, and older dispersing populations are found across MSFRs. Direct evidence for subcluster merging is still unconvincing.

40|$|SummaryHepatocyte {{growth factor}} (HGF) plays central roles in tubulogenesis and {{metastasis}} [1 – 4]. HGF treatment of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells grown as cysts in three-dimensional culture induces tubulogenesis [5, 6], which like most tubulogenic processes proceeds through distinct intermediate phases. Identification of genes {{associated with these}} phases is central to understanding the molecular mechanisms of tubulogensis; however, because of inefficient, <b>asynchronous</b> tubule <b>formation,</b> isolating such genes has been unfeasible. Here we developed a synchronous, efficient tubulogenesis system and used time-course transcriptional profiling to identify genes temporally regulated in developmental intermediates. Knockdown (KD) of tensin 4 (TNS 4), a particularly highly upregulated gene, leads to a decrease in formation of extensions and tubules, two sequential intermediates in tubulogenesis. Exogenous expression of TNS 4 marks invasive cells in an epithelial sheet. A mutation in the SH 2 domain of TNS 4 prevents the transition from extension formation to invasive migration during tubule formation and leads to increased basal activation of STAT 3. Exogenous expression of a constitutively active STAT 3 mimics the defect by the mutation. Our study highlights {{the role of the}} TNS 4 -STAT 3 axis in epithelial sheet invasion and tubulogenesis...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} nuclear and ooplasmic {{maturation}} of prepuberal calf oocytes was evaluated {{to determine a}} possible cause for their low developmental competency. Calf oocytes resumed meiosis and arrested at the metaphase II stage at rates {{similar to that of}} adult animals; however, zygotes derived from calf oocytes cleaved and developed at significantly lower rates. Ooplasmic maturation was assessed during oocyte maturation and fertilization. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that a majority of calf oocytes exhibited some delay in organelle migration and redistribution following maturation. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that following in vitro fertilization, a higher percentage of calf oocytes had abnormal chromatin and microtubule configurations than those of adult cattle. Delayed formation of sperm aster and <b>asynchronous</b> pronuclear <b>formation</b> characterized these anomalies. Microfluorometry was used to characterize the Ca 2 + responses of calf oocytes to the addition of agonists. The addition of thimerosal demonstrated the presence of Ca 2 + stores in calf oocytes. Injection of near threshold concentrations of inositol 1, 4, 5 -trishphosphate (InsP 3), used to test the sensitivity of the InsP 3 R, released significantly less Ca 2 + in calf than cow oocytes. Furthermore, injection of a porcine sperm factor elicited Ca 2 + release in calf oocytes, however, these responses did not exhibit the frequency or amplitude known to be characteristic of cow oocytes. These results suggested that the Ca 2 + content of the intracellular stores was similar, but the sensitivity of the Insp 3 R may be different. The activity of histone H 1 and MAP kinases, which are required for the initiation and completion of meiosis was evaluated, and the presence and maturation of the InsP 3 R system. Results show that following in vitro maturation, the activity of both histone H 1 and MAP kinases, as well as the relative amount of the InsP 3 R protein, were substantially lower in prepuberal calf oocytes when compared to oocytes of adult cattle. Together, these findings suggest that the low developmental competence of calf oocytes can be attributed, at least in part, to incomplete or delayed ooplasmic maturation. ...|$|R
40|$|We used multivariate {{analysis}} to model boreal forest stand structure and dynamics at Riding Mountain National Park, Manitoba {{based on data}} from 202 sampled stands. Eight forest stand-types were recognized based on canopy composition: black spruce on peat substrates, jack pine - black spruce, bur oak, eastern deciduous (green ash - American elm - Manitoba maple), balsam fir, trembling aspen - paper birch - mountain maple, trembling aspen - balsam poplar, and white spruce. The first four stand-types occur in edaphically distinct environments, while the four remaining boreal mixedwood stand-types occur in edaphically similar environments. We found that the composition and abundance of advance regeneration were best predicted by current canopy composition (redundancy = 54. 4 %); this reflects both the limited dispersal of conifer seeds and the strong vegetative reproductive capacity of hardwoods. Biotically-controlled site factors such as bareground, herb and shrub cover, ungulate browsing intensity, and stand age were also reasonably good predictors f advance regeneration (redundancy = 31. 7 %). Edaphic variables such as soil pH, conductivity, particle size, organic horizon depth and slope proved to be poor predictors of advance regeneration, however (redundancy = 18. 1 %). Size-class ordination indicated that many stand-types have relatively short successional trajectories, suggesting limited change in forest canopy composition over time. There are two exceptions: in the jack pine - black spruce stand-type, black spruce will increase over time, and in the trembling aspen - paper birch - mountain maple stand-type, eastern deciduous species (green ash, American elm, Manitoba maple, and bur oak) are forecast to become increasingly dominant. We also describe a synoptic model of mixedwood boreal forest stand dynamics for the Riding Mountain area. The model includes a number of factors that we consider to be critical determinants of forest dynamics, such as seed source availability, small and large-scale disturbances, species life-history characteristics, and environmental gradients. Our succession model is more similar those described for eastern than western Canada, which may reflect the lower frequency of catastrophic fires in the Riding Mountain area compared to boreal forests further west. Our model emphasizes that successional trajectories do not converge towards a single self-perpetuating "climax". Instead, successional vectors may diverge, converge or remain cyclical, and multiple potential pathways are possible for each stand-type. Our results also illustrate that species assemblages, and the propensity for canopy change in the absence of fire, are governed by the cumulative and synergistic effects of climate, topography, disturbance frequency, size and intensity, edaphic conditions, and the proximity of parental seed sources. Fire suppression in the southern boreal forest has resulted in a paradigm shift in disturbance regime, from large, synchronous catastrophic fires to small-scale, <b>asynchronous</b> gap <b>formation.</b> A major challenge for boreal forest ecologists is to determine the long-term consequences of this paradigm shift on the composition, structure and health of boreal forest stands and landscapes...|$|R
