25|$|Corporate {{transactional}} events generally {{fit into}} three categories: distressed securities, risk arbitrage, and special situations. Distressed securities include such events as restructurings, recapitalizations, and bankruptcies. A distressed securities investment strategy involves {{investing in the}} bonds or loans of companies facing bankruptcy or severe financial distress, when these bonds or loans are being traded at a discount to their value. Hedge fund managers pursuing the distressed debt investment strategy aim to capitalize on depressed bond prices. Hedge funds purchasing distressed debt may prevent those companies from going bankrupt, as such an acquisition deters foreclosure by banks. While event-driven investing in general tends to thrive during a bull market, distressed investing works best during <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Elliott's model, {{market prices}} {{alternate}} between an impulsive, or motive phase, and a corrective phase on all time scales of trend, as the illustration shows. Impulses are always subdivided into {{a set of}} 5 lower-degree waves, alternating again between motive and corrective character, so that waves 1, 3, and 5 are impulses, and waves 2 and 4 are smaller retraces of waves 1 and 3. Corrective waves subdivide into 3 smaller-degree waves starting with a five-wave counter-trend impulse, a retrace, and another impulse. In <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> <b>market</b> the dominant trend is downward, so the pattern is reversed—five waves down and three up. Motive waves always move with the trend, while corrective waves move against it.|$|E

2500|$|An {{issue with}} buying shares in <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> <b>market</b> is that despite {{appearing}} undervalued at one time, prices can still drop {{along with the}} market.

2500|$|In 1884 Charles H. Dow began {{tracking}} stocks, initially {{beginning with}} 11 stocks, mostly railroads, {{and looked at}} average prices for these eleven.

Dow's numbers were a [...] "convenient benchmark" [...] for analyzing the market and became an accepted way to look at the entire stock market. In 1889 the original stock report, Customers' Afternoon Letter, became The Wall Street Journal. Named in reference to the actual street, it became an influential international daily business newspaper published in New York City. After October 7, 1896, it began publishing Dow's expanded list of stocks. A century later, there were 30 stocks in the average.|$|E

50|$|One type of {{secondary}} market trend {{is called a}} market correction. A correction is a short term price decline of 5% to 20% or so. An example occurred from April to June 2010, when the S&P 500 went from above 1200 to near 1000; this was hailed {{as the end of}} the bull market and start of <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> <b>market,</b> but it was not, and the market turned back up.

50|$|An {{increase}} in prices during a primary trend bear market is called <b>a</b> <b>bear</b> <b>market</b> rally. <b>A</b> <b>bear</b> <b>market</b> rally is sometimes {{defined as an}} increase of 10% to 20%. Bear market rallies typically begin suddenly and are often short-lived. Notable bear market rallies occurred in the Dow Jones index after the 1929 stock market crash leading down to the market bottom in 1932, and throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. The Japanese Nikkei 225 has been typified {{by a number of}} bear market rallies since the late 1980s while experiencing an overall long-term downward trend.|$|E
