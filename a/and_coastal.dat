5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain, <b>and</b> <b>coastal</b> defences {{received}} little attention. Deal Castle was in a poor state of repair by 1615, the outer walls damaged by storms <b>and</b> <b>coastal</b> erosion, and a 1616 survey suggested that repairs estimated at £396 were necessary. The problems persisted, with the winter storms filling the moat with water and stones from the beach, and undermining the foundations; the castle's captain, William Byng, sent numerous complaints about this to his superiors. By 1634, surveys were suggesting that the repairs would now cost £1,243; a suggestion was put forward by the George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham, that nearby Camber Castle should be demolished to help provide materiel for the work at Deal. Most of the garrison were now living {{in the town of}} Deal and complaints were made by the Lord Warden in 1618 that only a small guard force was being left to secure the castle at night. As the condition of the castle waned, fighting between Dutch, French and Spanish ships in the Downs became common. Some repairs were probably finally carried out in the late 1630s.|$|E

To produce this map, we collated data from the literature, orthophotos, perspective photos, multibeam and side scan sonar data, and undertook direct surveys to ground truth data obtained using indirect techniques. We divided the information into nine thematic layers, including bathymetry, natural coastal types, geomorphological elements, seafloor coverage (both geological <b>and</b> biological), <b>coastal</b> <b>and</b> nearshore dynamics, human influence on <b>coastal</b> <b>and</b> marine environments, <b>coastal</b> occupation <b>and</b> protected areas...|$|R
