And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I {{was tired of}} playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E

500|$|Coward {{continued}} to perform {{during most of}} the First World War, appearing at the Prince of Wales's Theatre in 1916 in The Happy Family and on tour with Amy Brandon Thomas's company in Charley's Aunt. In 1917, he appeared in The Saving Grace, a comedy produced by Hawtrey. Coward recalled in his memoirs, [...] "My part was reasonably large <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> quite good in it, owing to the kindness and care of Hawtrey's direction. He took endless trouble with me... and taught me during those two short weeks many technical points of comedy acting which I use to this day." ...|$|E

500|$|However, {{the start}} date was pushed to November 1990 at both Babelsberg Studios in Munich, Germany and Barrandov Studios in Prague, Czech Republic. Production for The Phantom of the Opera was stalled with Lloyd Webber and Brightman's divorce. [...] "Everything got {{tied up in}} settlements", Schumacher reflected. [...] "Then my career took off <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> busy." [...] As a result, The Phantom of the Opera languished in {{development}} limbo for Warner Bros. throughout the 1990s. In February 1997, Schumacher considered returning, but eventually dropped out in favour of Batman Unchained, Runaway Jury and Dreamgirls. The studio was keen to cast John Travolta for the lead role, but also held discussions with Antonio Banderas, who undertook vocal preparation and sang {{the role of the}} Phantom in the TV special Andrew Lloyd Webber: The Royal Albert Hall Celebration.|$|E
500|$|Evans enjoyed an {{executive}} position at Apple until 1969, when Allen Klein {{was hired as}} a manager to reorganise the whole company. Evans was fired by Klein the next year, because Klein complained to Lennon that Aspinall and Evans were [...] "living like kings; like fucking emperors". Evans was later reinstated after McCartney, Harrison and Starr complained. On 13 September 1969, Evans accompanied Lennon, Yoko Ono, Klaus Voorman, Alan White and Eric Clapton to Toronto, Canada, for the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival concert. He later wrote: [...] "I was really enjoying myself. It was the first show I had roadied for three years <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> loving every minute of plugging the amps in and setting them up on stage, making sure that everything was right. Everyone wanted the show to go particularly well because Allen Klein, who had flown over, had organised for the whole of John's performance to be filmed. This was on top of it being video-taped by Dan Richter." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Sia {{released}} her fifth studio album, We Are Born, which peaked at number {{two on the}} ARIA Albums Chart and was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association. Following the release of We Are Born, Sia decided to retire from the career as a recording artist and established {{a career as a}} songwriter. She wrote the song [...] "Titanium" [...] for American singer Alicia Keys, but it was later sent to David Guetta, who included Sia's original demo vocals on the song and released it as a single in 2011. [...] "Titanium" [...] was a commercial success worldwide, peaking within the top five of record charts in the United States, Australia and numerous European regions. However, Sia was not pleased with the success of the single: [...] " [...] I never even knew it was gonna happen, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> upset. Because I had just retired, I was trying to be a pop songwriter, not an artist." [...] From 2011 to 2013, Sia became well known for writing songs for Beyoncé, Flo Rida, Christina Aguilera, and Rihanna.|$|E

500|$|On April 16, 1953 {{against the}} St. Louis Browns (the second {{game of the}} season, and Chicago's home opener) Pierce pitched his second one-hitter, a 1–0 victory in which he allowed only a seventh-inning double by Bobby Young; the White Sox gained only two singles in the contest, and scored on a walk, {{sacrifice}} hit, error and sacrifice fly. Pierce was chosen to start the All-Star Game for the AL – the first White Sox pitcher ever to do so – and allowed only one hit through three innings (a single by Stan Musial). Boston Red Sox star Ted Williams recalled of the game: [...] "It was a hot day at Crosley Field and I remember being so concerned for little Billy Pierce of the White Sox. Billy probably threw harder than anybody for a guy his size, he had a real big delivery, nice to look at, and he had overcome a lot. I understand he had had epilepsy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> pulling for him. He was a nervous little guy, {{and here he was}} starting his first All-Star game in a bandbox park that's tough to pitch in, and against Robin Roberts to boot. Pierce held them {{in the palm of his}} hand that day. He threw the ball right by everybody." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} shot on March 12, 2010 in Los Angeles, {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. Mandler previously worked with Drake {{on the video}} for his collaboration with Mary J. Blige, [...] "The One". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I think is an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I do all that, but I’m also somebody that’s asking, is that what I should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came to me because he wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the segment Bender stated, [...] "The big climactic cave sequence was hugely complex, and although it's very scary that this really terrifying thing is happening to our characters, {{at the end of the}} day I think the emotion from what we are experiencing is hopefully going to be the shock that people will stay with," [...] referring to Hodor's implied death. In an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor), he described filming the scene, [...] "It was a really heavy day — you’ve got these 100-mile-per-hour winds being blown into your face with false snow. I was really holding the door — there were like eight people pushing from the other side <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> holding them back. It’s definitely Method acting. It was a very intense day but one of the nice things was they let Isaac wrap me. He got to come over and say [...] "Mr. Nairn, that’s a wrap." [...] It was very emotional. It’s always been a little group of us together and it felt like our little group was breaking up." [...] Ellie Kendrick (Meera Reed) spoke about the filming of her part of the sequence, saying [...] "A lot of what's happening in that scene, in Meera's head, comes down to adrenaline. There's just no way she can stop and consider logically what's happening. If you have an army of the undead chasing after you, you're only going to be thinking one thing: [...] "Run!" [...] It was interesting, having the challenge of creating that adrenaline and fear and sadness of Hodor, but not being able to process it at all. Having to recreate that feeling of immediacy, in a stuffy studio at 4 p.m. on a Thursday when you've been filming the same scene for a couple of days, it was difficult. But it was an exciting challenge, to constantly inject the energy those characters must be feeling in that moment." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course," [...] she answered. [...] "I do {{not like}} to be a burden on any one, and after all, you see, Arthur <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> not related at all. He has always told me, too, that times have been so bad lately." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Aggravation" [...] was a Joe South song. The {{other musicians}} {{included}} Jimmy Page, Joe Moretti, John Paul Jones and Vic Flick & Bobby Graham on that record.

2500|$|After {{ten years}} of living, recording, and touring together, Europe {{decided to take a}} break {{at the end of the}} 1992 tour. [...] "I {{remember}} in the tour bus afterwards we were talking about where the whole thing was going and I think at the time the consensus of the band was we really felt ready for a break," [...] Tempest said, [...] "We felt that it was time to put some roots down <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> into the idea of making my own solo album." [...] In that time, Tempest and Marcello released solo albums whilst the other members participated in several different projects and bands. In return, Europe was dropped from Epic Records.|$|E
2500|$|Principal {{photography}} started mid-October 2011, {{and took}} place at Joss Whedon's residence in Santa Monica, California. On the choice of location, he told Studio 360, [...] "First of all, my wife built that house. And I knew from the moment I set foot in it that I would want to film something there. Because it's all in one place, that place informs the mood and the feeling and {{the look of the}} picture so much, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> already comfortable with that". Whedon and his wife, Kai Cole, produced the film through their studio Bellwether Pictures. It was filmed entirely in a black-and-white palette over a period of 12 days, in conjunction with cinematographer Jay Hunter. Whedon shot it while on a contractual vacation from the post-production of The Avengers. The cast and crew were informed to keep the project a secret until production was finished. They wrapped their last day of filming on October 23, 2011.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2014, whilst {{speaking}} with Dhaka Tribune, Musa said, [...] "...In {{the journey of}} this movie I got to explore various genres and discover my own abilities as a music director <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>really</b> proud that my first film soundtrack was one about ‘71 Bangladesh Liberation War." ...|$|R
6000|$|The way {{she dropped}} these words--they {{would have been}} admirable on the stage--made him reply with prompt ease: [...] "What I meant just now was that you're not to tell him, after all my swagger, that I {{consider}} that you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> required to save our theatre." ...|$|R

2500|$|Hall {{was offered}} the {{starring}} role in the 1987 film Full Metal Jacket {{in a conversation with}} Stanley Kubrick, but after an eight-month negotiation, a financial agreement could not be reached. [...] "It was a difficult decision, because in that eight-month period, I read everything I could about the guy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> fascinated by him," [...] Hall said when asked about the film. [...] "I {{wanted to be a part}} of that film, but it didn't work out. But all sorts of stories circulated, like I got on set and I was fired, or I was pissed at him for shooting too long. It's all not true." [...] He was replaced with Matthew Modine. His next film would be 1988's Johnny Be Good, in which he worked with Uma Thurman and fellow Saturday Night Live cast member Robert Downey, Jr. The film was a critical failure, and some critics panned Hall's performance as a high school football star, claiming that he, the movies' reigning geek, was miscast for the role. A review for The Washington Post claimed that the film was [...] "crass, vulgar, and relentlessly brain-dead." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} split with Erica, Armstrong {{met a woman}} he has {{identified}} only as [...] "Amanda" [...] at Gilman, and they started dating. Amanda produced and distributed her own zine and was an iron-willed feminist, which enthralled Armstrong. Amanda, however, was unimpressed with Armstrong and though the couple dated for some time she ultimately dumped him in 1994 and joined the Peace Corps leaving Armstrong feeling suicidal. Armstrong stated {{in an interview with}} Spin about the inspiration behind the Insomniac song Armitage Shanks in 1995, [...] "It was right before Dookie came out <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> at odds with myself. I was like man do I really want to do this? A lot of time I was thinking about suicide, how it's so easy to kill yourself, but it's so hard to stay alive. I was in a break-up with my then girlfriend, a total, raving punk rocker who didn't approve of me being on a major label. She moved down to Ecuador saying she couldn't live in a world with McDonald's and such. It was fucking me up pretty bad." [...] Armstrong has written many songs about Amanda, both during their relationship and afterwards, including [...] "She", [...] "Good Riddance", [...] "Stuart And The Ave", [...] "Sassafrass Roots", [...] "Amanda", [...] "She's A Rebel", [...] "Extraordinary Girl" [...] and [...] "Whatsername". The hero, [...] "Whatsername", on the album American Idiot, and in the American Idiot musical, is based on Amanda.|$|E

5000|$|Composer Brian Tyler {{recorded}} the {{score for the}} film.

6000|$|... "Oh, Harry, {{you don't}} {{mean to say}} so," [...] I cried, for I was West Indian enough in my {{feelings}} {{to have a certain}} innate horror of coloured blood, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> shocked to think I had been so imprudent as to dance four times with a brown man.|$|E
