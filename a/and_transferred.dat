40|$|This paper {{sheds light}} on how Australia 2 ̆ 7 s tax <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> system {{functions}} to distribute income across the population and over lifetimes. It: 	provides a descriptive analysis {{of the flow of}} major taxes (personal income tax <b>and</b> GST) <b>and</b> <b>transfers</b> between families under existing policy settings 	examines the direct impact of the tax <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> system on returns to paid work 	examines how families contribute to taxes <b>and</b> benefit from <b>transfer</b> payments over the course of their lives under various assumptions, and projects tax <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> flows in the future. At a glance Chapter 2 provides an overview of the tax <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> system in Australia, and develops a conceptual framework for examining income redistribution via the tax <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> system. Chapter 3 looks at the existing state of evidence on the incidence of taxes <b>and</b> <b>transfers</b> on both annual and life cycle bases. This includes a review of existing literature on: tax 2 ̆ 7 churn 2 ̆ 7; effective average and effective marginal tax rates; and the annual and life cycle distribution of taxes <b>and</b> <b>transfers</b> from Australia <b>and</b> overseas. Chapter 4 analyses the results of the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s estimates of taxes paid <b>and</b> <b>transfers</b> received by different groups in a single year. It examines how tax <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> flows vary with income, wealth and age and how different policies contribute to these flows. Chapter 5 examines the effective marginal tax rates and participation tax rates faced by different groups. Chapter 6 uses simple, illustrative approaches to investigate how the current tax <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> system redistributes income over lifetimes and to explore how income growth and population ageing could affect tax <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> flows in the future...|$|R
40|$|Tax <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> {{programs}} transform before-tax income into after-tax income. Income is {{variable and}} the tax <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> system is nonlinear-i. e., marginal tax rates vary. We show that, as a consequence, the tax <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> system punishes (<b>and</b> rewards) income variability. We calculate {{the effect of the}} nonlinearity for several components of the U. S. tax <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> system, focusing on the low-income population. We find that the system rewards variability for some individuals and penalizes it for others. We conclude that the tax <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> system punishes <b>and</b> rewards variability {{in a manner that is}} both substantial and capricious. ...|$|R
