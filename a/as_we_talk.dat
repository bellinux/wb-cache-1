6000|$|Consider that {{everything}} I am writing of {{took place in}} an almost pre-historic era {{in the history of}} British India. Some folk may remember the years before lawn-tennis was born when we all played croquet. There were seasons before that, if you will believe me, when even croquet had not been invented, and archery--which was revived in England in 1844--was as great a pest as lawn-tennis is now. People talked learnedly about [...] "holding" [...] and [...] "loosing," [...] "steles," [...] "reflexed bows," [...] "56-pound bows," [...] "backed" [...] or [...] "self-yew bows," [...] <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about [...] "rallies," [...] "volleys," [...] "smashes," [...] "returns," [...] and [...] "16-ounce rackets." ...|$|E
60|$|And it {{does not}} mean that. I suppose, that three hundred years ago (when the Bible was {{translated}} out of the Greek tongue, in which the Apostles wrote, into English), 'taking thought' meant something different from what it does now: but the plain meaning of the text, if it be put into such English <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> now, is, 'Do not fret about the morrow. Be not anxious about the morrow.' There is no doubt at all, as any scholar can tell you, that that is the plain meaning of the word in our modern English, and that our Lord is not telling us to be imprudent or idle, but not to be anxious and fretful about the morrow.|$|E

Another man dies to-night, even <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> here, and confesses himself guilty of the Rue de Montpelier affair. But let that pass. We have crossed swords, Sir Julien, and I frankly admit, {{although}} I have gained my end to-night, that I am worsted. The money I spent to purchase Le Jour has been thrown away. The months of careful intrigue, the sacrifices and efforts I have made to destroy the entente, have been rendered almost futile by your diabolical pen.

60|$|As {{our past}} rises in reminiscence {{with all its}} oldtime reality, no less clearly does our future stand out to us in mirage. What we would be seems as realizable as what we were. Seen by another beside ourselves, our castles in the air take on {{something}} of the substance of stereoscopic sight. Our airiest fancies seem solid facts for their reality to her, and gilded by lovelight, they glitter and sparkle like a true palace of the East. For once all is possible; nothing lies beyond our reach. And <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk,</b> and she listens, we two seem to be floating off into an empyrean of our own like the summer clouds above our heads, as they sail dreamily on into the far-away depths of the unfathomable sky.|$|E

With a tube in his hand he rushed over {{to his wife and}} held it to her face. In a few seconds she moaned, stirred, and sat up. He turned to me, and I felt the tide of life stealing warmly through my arteries. My reason {{told me that it was}} but a little respite, and yet, carelessly <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> of its value, every hour of existence now seemed an inestimable thing. Never have I known such a thrill of sensuous joy as came with that freshet of life. The weight fell away from my lungs, the band loosened from my brow, a sweet feeling of peace and gentle, languid comfort stole over me. I lay watching Summerlee revive under the same remedy, and finally Lord John took his turn. He sprang to his feet and gave me a hand to rise, while Challenger picked up his wife and laid her on the settee.|$|E
6000|$|Every one of {{the popular}} modern phrases and ideals is a dodge in order to shirk the problem of what is good. We are fond of talking about [...] "liberty"; that, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> of it, is a dodge to avoid {{discussing}} what is good. We are fond of talking about [...] "progress"; that is a dodge to avoid discussing what is good. We are fond of talking about [...] "education"; that is a dodge to avoid discussing what is good. The modern man says, [...] "Let us leave all these arbitrary standards and embrace liberty." [...] This is, logically rendered, [...] "Let us not decide what is good, but let it be considered good not to decide it." [...] He says, [...] "Away with your old moral formulae; I am for progress." [...] This, logically stated, means, [...] "Let us not settle what is good; but let us settle whether we are getting more of it." [...] He says, [...] "Neither in religion nor morality, my friend, lie the hopes of the race, but in education."

6000|$|It was in {{virtue of}} his sincerity, of his {{speaking}} still in some sort {{from the heart of}} Nature, though in the current artificial dialect, that Johnson was a Prophet. Are not all dialects [...] "artificial"? Artificial things are not all false;--nay every true Product of Nature will infallibly shape itself; we may say all artificial things are, at the starting of them, true. What we call [...] "Formulas" [...] are not in their origin bad; they are indispensably good. Formula is method, habitude; found wherever man is found. Formulas fashion themselves as Paths do, as beaten Highways, leading toward some sacred or high object, whither many men are bent. Consider it. One man, full of heartfelt earnest impulse, finds out a way of doing somewhat,--were it of uttering his soul's reverence for the Highest, were it but of fitly saluting his fellow-man. An inventor was needed to do that, a poet; he has articulated the dim-struggling thought that dwelt in his own and many hearts. This is his way of doing that; these are his footsteps, the beginning of a [...] "Path." [...] And now see: the second men travels naturally in the footsteps of his foregoer, it is the easiest method. In the footsteps of his foregoer; yet with improvements, with changes where such seem good; at all events with enlargements, the Path ever widening itself as more travel it;--till at last there is a broad Highway whereon the whole world may travel and drive. While there remains a City or Shrine, or any Reality to drive to, at the farther end, the Highway shall be right welcome! When the City is gone, we will forsake the Highway. In this manner all Institutions, Practices, Regulated Things in the world have come into existence, and gone out of existence. Formulas all begin by being full of substance; you may call them the skin, the articulation into shape, into limbs and skin, of a substance that is already there: they had not been there otherwise. Idols, as we said, are not idolatrous till they become doubtful, empty for the worshipper's heart. Much <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> against Formulas, I hope no one of us is ignorant withal of the high significance of true Formulas; that they were, and will ever be, the indispensablest furniture of our habitation in this world.-- ...|$|E
60|$|The other notable element was this: {{that when}} the produce of the land began by custom to be cut up and only {{partially}} transmitted to the lord, the remainder was generally subdivided into two types of property. One the serfs enjoyed severally, in private patches, while the other they enjoyed in common, and generally {{in common with the}} lord. Thus arose the momentously important mediæval institutions of the Common Land, owned side by side with private land. It was an alternative and a refuge. The mediævals, except when they were monks, were none of them Communists; but they were all, as it were, potential Communists. It is typical of the dark and dehumanized picture now drawn of the period that our romances constantly describe a broken man as falling back on the forests and the outlaw's den, but never describe him as falling back on the common land, which was a much more common incident. Mediævalism believed in mending its broken men; and as the idea existed in the communal life for monks, it existed in the communal land for peasants. It was their great green hospital, their free and airy workhouse. A Common was not a naked and negative thing like the scrub or heath we call a Common on the edges of the suburbs. It was a reserve of wealth like a reserve of grain in a barn; it was deliberately kept back as a balance, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> of a balance at the bank. Now these provisions for a healthier distribution of property would by themselves show any man of imagination that a real moral effort had been made towards social justice; that it could not have been mere evolutionary accident that slowly turned the slave into a serf, and the serf into a peasant proprietor. But if anybody still thinks that mere blind luck, without any groping for the light, had somehow brought about the peasant condition in place of the agrarian slave estate, he has only to turn to what was happening in all the other callings and affairs of humanity. Then he will cease to doubt. For he will find the same mediæval men busy upon a social scheme which points as plainly in effect to pity and a craving for equality. And it is a system which could no more be produced by accident than one of their cathedrals could be built by an earthquake.|$|E
60|$|In a Word, let me caution you all, {{when you}} {{trade with the}} Devil, either get the Price or quit the Bargain; the Devil is a cunning Shaver, he will wriggle {{himself out of the}} Performance on his Side if possible, and yet expect you should be {{punctual}} on your Side. They tell you of a poor Fellow in Herefordshire, that offer'd to sell his Soul to him for a Cow, and though the Devil promised, and as they say, sign'd the Writings, yet the poor Countryman could never get the Cow of him, but still as he brought a Cow to him, some body or other came and challeng'd it, proving that it was lost or stolen from them; so that the Man got nothing but the Name of a Cow-stealer, and was at last carried to Hereford Goal, and condemn'd to be hang'd for stealing two Cows, one after the other: The wicked Fellow was then in the greatest Distress imaginable, he summon'd his Devil to help him out, but he failed him, as the Devil always will; he really had not stolen the Cows, but they were found in his Possession, and he could give no Account how he came by them; at last he was driven to confess the Truth, told the horrid Bargain he had made, and how the Devil often promis'd him a Cow, but never gave him one, except that several Times in the Morning early he found a Cow put into his Yard, but it always prov'd to belong to some of his Neighbours: Whether the Man was hang'd or no, the Story does not relate; but this Part is to my Purpose, that they that make Bargains with the Devil, ought to make him give Security for the Performance of Covenants, and who the Devil would get to be bound for him, I can't tell, they must look to that who make the Bargain: Besides, if he had not had a Mind to cheat or baffle the poor Man, what need he have taken a Cow so near home? if he had such and such Powers <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> of, and as Fancy and Fable furnish for him, could not he have carried a Cow in the Air upon a Broom-stick, as well as an old Woman? Could he not have stole a Cow for him in Lincolnshire, and set it down in Herefordshire, and so have performed his Bargain, saved his Credit, and kept the poor Man out of Trouble? so that if the Story is True, as I really believe it is, either it is not the Devil that makes those Bargains, or the Devil has not such Power as we bestow on him, except on Special Occasions he gets a Permit, and is bid go, as in the Case of Job, the Gadaren Hogs, and the like.|$|E

50|$|Another very {{interesting}} {{point on the}} debate {{of whether or not}} it is ethical and moral to engineer the human germline is a perspective of looking at past technologies and how they have evolved. Dr. Gregory Stock discusses the use of several diagnostic tests used to monitor current pregnancies and several diagnostic tests that can be done to determine the health of embryos. Such tests include amniocentesis, ultrasounds, and other preimplantation genetic diagnostic tests. These tests are quite common, and reliable, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about them today; however, in the past when they were first introduced, they too were scrutinized.|$|E

50|$|The world's oldest known dock is {{situated}} at the Indus Valley site of Lothal (2400 BCE). It was located away from the main current to avoid deposition of silt. Modern oceanographers have observed that the Harappans must have possessed great knowledge relating to tides {{in order to build}} such a dock on the ever-shifting course of the Sabarmati, as well as exemplary hydrography and maritime engineering. This was the earliest known dock found in the world, equipped to berth and service ships. It is speculated that Lothal engineers studied tidal movements, and their effects on brick-built structures, since the walls are of kiln-burnt bricks. Come explore the history of this dock with us, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> with archaeologists, oceanographers, maritime engineers and scientists, and travel down to Lothal to unravel the science and technology behind this marvel of engineering and try and gain some insight into the minds and culture of the Harappan people who created this marvel and then fell into obscurity.|$|E
