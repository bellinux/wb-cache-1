We name this method coordination iterative Boltzmann inversion (C-IBI). While the underlying coarse-grained model is still structure based and, thus, preserves pair-wise solution structure, our method also reproduces solvation thermodynamics of binary and/or ternary mixtures.

40|$|Proteins are {{denatured}} in <b>aqueous</b> <b>urea</b> solution. The {{nature of}} the molecular driving forces has received substantial attention in the past, whereas the question how urea acts at different phases of unfolding is not yet well understood at the atomic level. In particular, {{it is unclear whether}} urea actively attacks folded proteins or instead stabilizes unfolded conformations. Here we investigated the effect of urea at different phases of unfolding by molecular dynamics simulations, and the behavior of partially unfolded states in both <b>aqueous</b> <b>urea</b> solution and in pure water was compared. Whereas the partially unfolded protein in water exhibited hydrophobic collapses as primary refolding events, it remained stable or even underwent further unfolding steps in <b>aqueous</b> <b>urea</b> solution. Further, initial unfolding steps of the folded protein were found not to be triggered by urea, but instead, stabilized. The underlying mechanism of this stabilization is a favorable interaction of urea with transiently exposed, less-polar residues and the protein backbone, thereby impeding back-reactions. Taken together, these results suggest that, quite generally, urea-induced protein unfolding proceeds primarily not by active attack. Rather, thermal fluctuations toward the unfolded state are stabilized and the hydrophobic collapse of partially unfolded proteins toward the native state is impeded. As a result, the equilibrium is shifted toward the unfolded state...|$|E

However, CGM disintegrates to a powder subsequent to processing with polar plasticisers, such as water. The hypothesis {{of this study was}} that <b>aqueous</b> <b>urea</b> could be used to denature protein within CGM and therefore encourage protein–protein interactions leading to consolidated bioplastics when using water as a plasticiser. To assess this, the effects of <b>aqueous</b> <b>urea</b> on structure and properties of CGM with particular focus on storage were assessed. Processing of CGM with <b>aqueous</b> <b>urea</b> produced consolidated materials. FTIR analysis showed secondary structure was modified during processing, leading to increased amounts of α-helices and random coils and reduction of the amount of intermolecular β-sheets and turns. Above 6 wt% free water, the plasticising efficiency of water in processed CGM increased as the amount of denatured proteins increased. Below 6 wt% free water, protein secondary structure did not have a significant influence on thermal and flexural properties. It was found that storage environment and urea concentration influenced the rate of drying, however, the final water content was constant relative to CGM, and not urea.

40|$|Application of SCR {{catalyst}} {{technology in}} a light-duty Diesel exhaust system requires injection of a reductant. <b>Aqueous</b> <b>urea</b> is injected with a spray unit {{directly into the}} exhaust upstream of an SCR catalyst. Ideally, the <b>aqueous</b> <b>urea</b> droplets must first evaporate and break down to ammonia and HCNO before reaching the catalyst. Multiple chemical reactions then occur on the catalyst reducing NOx. Droplet size is thus critical in this process. Laser PDPA measurements {{have been made in}} the laboratory of the diameter of water droplets from a commercially available urea spray unit in hot air flow to characterize the spray. These measurements have shown significant numbers of droplets with diameters greater than 120 microns. Measurements have also been made with a typical mixer unit downstream of the spray unit and the effect of this on the droplet size distribution is reported. A simple model of the warm up and evaporation of an <b>aqueous</b> <b>urea</b> droplet convecting in a Diesel exhaust has been developed. This can be run as a single droplet simulation programme but could be incorporated into a full CFD model. The latter is required for designing SCR injection systems without recourse to testing. The model is valid for the early part of the evaporation process where it is assumed that water leaves the <b>aqueous</b> <b>urea</b> droplet and also for the later stage where the urea leaves the droplet prior to breaking down by thermolysis. The model has been tested against data available in the literature. The effect of initial droplet size, droplet injection temperature and velocity, and of the exhaust temperature, vapour pressure and flow rate under typical operating conditions are demonstrated. The implications of the model are that the urea droplets must be very small, less than 50 microns, if they are to evaporate in the short distance between the injector and the catalyst in a typical light duty Diesel exhaust system...|$|E

The current study provided evidence for the indirect mechanism by demonstrating that the introduction of urea slightly changes the water structure in the hydrophobic interfacial areas. In the current study, the <b>urea</b> <b>aqueous</b> solution systems with either gas-liquid or hydrophobic interface are studied by MD simulations, and the structures of water near the interfacial areas are analyzed in terms of density, orientation and number of hydrogen bonds.

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry {{is expected to}} adopt SCR after-treatment to control NOx emissions from Diesel passenger cars from 2010. Ammonia promotes NOx reduction and is introduced into the exhaust as a spray of <b>aqueous</b> <b>urea</b> droplets. This is a new aspect of CFD modelling of exhaust after-treatment. When modelling sprays the mesh must be 3 D and so the porous medium approach is appropriate, circumventing the need for representative single channel modelling. The porous medium technique is well established for modelling three-way catalysis and its application to SCR is demonstrated in this paper, using a kinetic scheme available in the literature. Laboratory measurements of droplet diameters {{have been used to}} specify the input of <b>aqueous</b> <b>urea</b> to the CFD model.

40|$|The time {{resolved}} optical Kerr effect (OKE) {{has been}} applied to <b>aqueous</b> <b>urea</b> (urea= 0. 18) at different temperatures ranging from 283 to 333 K in order to investigate the behaviour of the different reorientational relaxation times and the low frequency OKE response of the system. The relaxation times follow the Debye–Stokes–Einstein (DSE) theory. These results reveal that at a microscopic level the reorientation of a molecule of urea is anisotropic. This anisotropy is expressed as an orientational correlation between urea molecules, as revealed by both the asymptotic decay of the Nurea–Nurea radial distribution function and by the angular distribution probability at different distances between urea molecules. It is speculated that this anisotropy {{plays an important role in}} the denaturation of proteins in <b>aqueous</b> <b>urea</b> solutions.

Differences in behavior were even found for samples hydrothermally aged immediately following exposure to the urea solution or if the sample was dried overnight before hydrothermal aging.

The second virial coefficients of the excess enthalpies are found to be positive for all the systems studied in water-urea mixtures. A preliminary analysis, carried out using the Savage and Wood group additivity approach, suggests that, in concentrated <b>aqueous</b> solutions of <b>urea,</b> this arises from the peptide-peptide or hydroxyl-hydroxyl, and the apolar-apolar group contributions, all being positive, and these overwhelm the negative contributions from the polar-apolar group interactions. A remarkable feature is the inversion of the signs of the peptide-peptide, hydroxyl-hydroxyl, peptide-methylene and hydroxyl-methylene, group interactions when compared with those which prevail in pure water. This suggests a completely different solvation and interaction mechanism in concentrated urea solutions. The enthalpic contributions from apolar-apolar group interactions in the mixed solvent, in turn, are higher than the values found in water.

40|$|Forming peptide {{hydrogen}} bonds {{was considered to}} be probably the most important driving force for protein folding in 1951, when Linus Pauling and Robert Corey proposed the hydrogen-bonded structures of the -helix (1) and two -sheets (2). Because the peptide CO and NH groups form competing {{hydrogen bonds}} (H-bonds) to water when a protein is unfolded it was evident, however, that the net contribution of the peptide H-bond (COHN) to protein stability might be small. In 1955 John Schellman (3, 4) made a first analysis of the energetics of peptide H-bonds in protein folding reactions. He listed the factors that should affect the stability of a peptide -helix in water, and he estimated the strength of the peptide H-bond in water by attributing the unusual thermodynamics of <b>aqueous</b> <b>urea</b> solutions (which had been measured accurately) to H-bonded urea dimers.

Osmoprotectant glycine betaine (GB) stabilizes proteins against denaturation and counteracts harsh conditions such as presence of high concentration of urea. Therefore, it is interesting to specifically investigate the effect of osmolytes on hydrophobic interactions to explore whether the latter plays any role in the counteraction of denaturing property of urea. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations have been performed on neopentane (NEP), a non-polar molecule, in <b>aqueous</b> GB, <b>urea,</b> and'GB-urea mixture to understand the effect of GB on hydrophobic interactions in the presence of urea. The results were analyzed by calculating radial distribution function, potential of mean force, coordination number, and interaction energies. The results indicate that the presence of GB decreases hydrophobic interactions between urea and NEP. We also find that GB and urea molecules strongly interact with each other through H bonding and electrostatic interactions. However, GB and urea have negligible effect on hydrophobic interactions between the NEP molecules.
