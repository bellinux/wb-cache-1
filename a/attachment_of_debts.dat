40|$|<b>Attachment</b> <b>of</b> wage {{as a way}} for {{creditors}} {{to enforce}} payment by unwilling or insolvent debtors is not very successful in several countries. Based on a dynamic model of debtor behaviour, this paper explores two alternatives of reform. One is to reduce the rate <b>of</b> <b>attachment,</b> which at present amounts to 100 percent of the wage income exceeding the subsistence level, thus probably destroying incentives to work. According to model simulations, reducing the attachment rate is likely to result in an increase of labour supply but a decrease <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> revenue per period. Second, the introduction <b>of</b> a <b>debt</b> release would have an ambiguous effect on labour supply. While resulting in a partial loss for creditors, it would permit debtors to get out <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> A Pareto improvement thus {{does not seem to be}} possible. When taking the taxpayers as an involved third party into account, however, a potential Pareto improvement appears attainable. <b>debt,</b> insolvency, <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> wage, subsistence level...|$|R

40|$|The on line <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> {{financial}} assets: {{thoughts about}} {{the improvement of the}} Brazilian Procedural Code in light of an economic analysis of law. ABSTRACT: Procedural Law represents an important tool of application of material law, since it is by the means of procedural law that the litigants presents their claims to the judges aiming at the defense of their rights. Considering that it is during the execution of the sentence, when it is transformed into the benefit of the creditor, the sluggishness and inefficiencies of this phase hinders the enforcement of the sentence and makes it difficult to enforce the collection <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> and contracts, urging uncertainty in the economy. To face the problems of sluggishness and inefficiency of the Judiciary, Brazil has promoted changes in the procedural laws, especially with the edition of Law nº 11. 387 that establishes the enforcement <b>of</b> online <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> financial assets. In this scenario, this paper seeks to analyze how the introduction of this tool by Law nº 11. 387, can confer greater efficiency to the procedural process, which results in positive effects to the administration of the judicial system and the economy as a whole...|$|R

40|$|I {{examine the}} role <b>of</b> {{third-party}} <b>debt</b> collectors in consumer credit markets.

A one-percent change in the number <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> collectors per capita leads to a 0. 49 % change in the average credit card balance and a 1. 32 % change in the average balance on non-credit card unsecured loans. There is also some evidence that creditors substitute unsecured credit for secured credit when the number <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> collectors increases. Higher density <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> collectors improves recoveries, which enables lenders to extend more credit. Finally, creditors charge higher interest rates and lend to a larger pool of borrowers when the density <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> collectors increases, presumably because better collections enable them to extend credit to riskier applicants...|$|R
