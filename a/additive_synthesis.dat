40|$|AbstractThe {{main goal}} of every agent {{is to make}} a good decision. The Analytic Hierarchy Process is {{frequently}} used approach for solving decision making problems. There exists wide range of software programs utilizing that approach. Main disadvantage of those software products is that they are commercial and relatively expensive and thus it prevents them to be used by small companies, students or researchers. This contribution introduces a Microsoft Excel add-in called DAME – Decision Analysis Module for Excel. Comparing to other computer programs DAME is free, can work with scenarios or multiple decision makers, allows for easy manipulation with data, utilizes capabilities of Microsoft Excel and displays all intermediate calculations. Decision makers can structure their decision models into three levels – scenarios/users, criteria and variants. Elements on all three levels can be evaluated either by direct values or pair-wise comparisons. For each pair-wise comparison matrix there is calculated an inconsistency index. There are provided three different methods for the evaluation of the weights of criteria, the variants as well as the scenarios/users – Saaty's Method, Geometric Mean Method and Fuller's Triangle Method. Multiplicative and <b>additive</b> <b>syntheses</b> are supported. All calculations are instant so users can easily see what happen if anything is modified.

500|$|Jeff {{has stated}} that {{starting}} from the album The Painful Experience they incorporated their own approach to record drum tracks in the studio which they call [...] "hybrid drums", a mix of real-time performance and software-based matrix programming. He also mentioned the efficiency of using the hybrid drumming compared with getting a drummer: [...] "About the drummer, it is still {{very hard to find}} a right drummer because Kekal music is ranging from very extreme-metal with blast beats and fast double-kicks, to powerful rock beats that demand steady tempo, and to some polyrhythmic playing and time-signature shifts in the characteristics of jazz and prog drumming. We would need 2 or 3 kinds of drummer for Kekal. That's why the best thing for the recording is to make the hybrid drumming." [...] In other interview, Jeff mentioned the process of recording of The Habit of Fire, starting from collecting samples and creating MIDI information, then manipulating the sounds to create what he called the 'skeleton'. Then riffs, MIDI-triggered instruments, synthesizers, and melodies would be added and the structure re-arranged once again. Once the song structure was set, the guitars would be re-recorded, then bass and drum tracks would be put on top, then vocals.
