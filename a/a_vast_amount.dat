40|$|Abstract—MicroRNAs, by {{regulating}} {{the expression of}} hundreds of target genes, play critical roles in developmental biology and the etiology of numerous diseases, including cancer. <b>As</b> <b>vast</b> <b>amounts</b> of microRNA expression profile data are now publicly available, the integration of those data sets with gene expression profiles represents an extremely active area of life science research. However, the ability to conduct genomewide microRNA-mRNA (gene) integration currently requires sophisticated, high-end informatics tools, significant expertise in bioinformatics and computer science {{to carry out the}} complex integration analysis. In addition, increased computing infrastructure capabilities are essential in order to accommodate large data sets.

30|$|Predicting human {{mobility}} flows {{at different}} spatial scales is {{challenged by the}} heterogeneity of individual trajectories and the multi-scale nature of transportation networks. <b>As</b> <b>vast</b> <b>amounts</b> of digital traces of human behaviour become available, an opportunity arises to improve mobility models by integrating into them proxy data on mobility collected {{by a variety of}} digital platforms and location-aware services. Here we propose a hybrid model of human mobility that integrates a large-scale publicly available dataset from a popular photo-sharing system with the classical gravity model, under a stacked regression procedure. We validate the performance and generalizability of our approach using two ground-truth datasets on air travel and daily commuting in the United States: using two different cross-validation schemes we show that the hybrid model affords enhanced mobility prediction at both spatial scales.|$|R
