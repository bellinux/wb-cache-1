5|$|According {{to one of}} {{the many}} Greek legends about the Constantinople's fall to the Ottomans, when the Turks entered the city, an angel rescued the emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos, turned him into marble and placed him in a cave under the earth near the Golden Gate, where he waits to be brought to life again to conquer the city back for Christians. The legend {{explained}} the later walling up of the gate as a Turkish precaution <b>against</b> <b>this</b> prophecy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Against</b> <b>this</b> {{economic}} backdrop a {{new generation}} of venture capitalist owners had emerged. They took the place of the community groups, local consortiums, or philanthropists that typically had owned the teams and operated them without any serious profit motive.

5|$|Although Jewish, Levi's {{family did}} not {{practise}} their religion, {{and were not}} part of the Jewish community, but when she was enrolled at the Victoria School (now the Bettina School) in Frankfurt, her religion was listed as Jewish. Religious instruction was compulsory, so she had to attend classes with a local rabbi. She soon rebelled <b>against</b> <b>this,</b> and told her parents that she did not wish to attend the classes. She came to reject formal religion.|$|E

5|$|By 1943, 40% of the NFL rosters {{had been}} {{drafted into the}} United States Armed Forces for World War II. The {{resulting}} difficulty in fielding a full-strength squad led some owners to recommend the league should shut down until the war ended.

5|$|During World War I the South Arklow Lightvessel Guillemot, {{operated}} by the Commissioners of Irish Lights, had given warning of a U-boat. In consequence on 28 March 1917 UC-65 surfaced, ordered the crew into their lifeboat, and sank the Guillemot. <b>Against</b> <b>this</b> background the sinking of Irish Oak became a hotly debated issue.|$|E
5|$|II Napoleon {{ordered the}} {{assemblage}} of over 5,000 artillery for transport through the pass, {{despite the fact}} that the pass was widely considered to be much too narrow, and the route too volatile and unstable, to allow any form of artillery, light or heavy, to come through. Thus, Napoleons military advisers warned him <b>against</b> <b>this</b> move, but he insisted on this presence of this great number of artillery.|$|E
5|$|Lucullus had {{initially}} {{decided to make}} a running charge with his infantry, a Roman military tactic that minimized the amount of time an enemy could utilize its archers and sling infantry prior to close combat engagement. However, he decided <b>against</b> <b>this</b> at the last moment when he realized that the Armenian cataphracts posed the greatest threat to his men, ordering instead a diversionary attack with his Gallic and Thracian cavalry against the cataphracts.|$|E

5|$|NOTE: Opinion {{is divided}} {{about the size}} of an ala turma, between 30 and 32 men. 30 {{was the size of a}} turma in the Republican cavalry and in the cohors equitata of the Principate auxilia. <b>Against</b> <b>this</b> is a {{statement}} by Arrian that an ala was 512 strong. This would make an ala turma 32 men strong.|$|E

5|$|Set <b>against</b> <b>this,</b> the purges of the Red Army leadership, {{in which}} Molotov participated, {{weakened}} the Soviet Union's defence capacity {{and contributed to}} the military disasters of 1941 and 1942, which were mostly caused by unreadiness for war. The purges also led to the dismantling of privatised agriculture and its replacement by collectivised agriculture. This left a legacy of chronic agricultural inefficiencies and under-production which the Soviet regime never fully rectified.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} have disagreed with parts of Watson's proposal, {{arguing that the}} four staple crops were already widely disseminated before that period, and that Islamic irrigation built on rather than replacing the Roman irrigation network in Spain. <b>Against</b> <b>this,</b> the historian Paolo Squatriti, reviewing Watson's paper 40 years on, noted that it had proven useful to many different historical agendas, and had held up surprisingly well {{in the face of}} new findings in archaeology and archaeobotany.|$|E
