40|$|The {{present study}} reconstructs the paleovegetation of a varzea (seasonally flooded) {{forest in the}} central parts of the Madeira River {{floodplain}} in Brazil using palynological data. Forty-nine cut-bank sediment samples from the Madeira River were processed in the study; from these, ten samples contained pollen: two contained pollen from the Middle Pleniglacial age, one contained pollen from the Tardiglacial age, six contained pollen from the Holocene, and one contained more recently deposited pollen. The Middle Pleniglacial pollen belonged to <b>a</b> primary <b>succession</b> varzea forest, while the Tardiglacial pollen represented <b>a</b> late <b>succession</b> varzea forest. On the other hand, the three Holocene samples showed the characteristic composition of chavascal (water-logged forest) or lacustrine varzea forest, and three samples belonged to <b>a</b> late <b>succession</b> varzea forest. The most recent pollen deposit represented <b>a</b> secondary <b>succession</b> varzea forest. This paleovegetation showed a typical mosaic distribution, which {{may be explained by}} the fluvial dynamics, high species richness and diversity in the varzea forest, and the presence of dominant species...|$|R

If Palpatine was the first, Kaminski infers, he would therefore not be the current. Later Lucas would abandon this idea, opting instead to focus on a sole villainous ruler.|$|E
