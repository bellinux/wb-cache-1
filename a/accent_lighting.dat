50|$|Overcoming speech impediments and {{sometimes}} paralyzing stage fright {{as a young}} man, Jouvet's first important association was with Jacques Copeau's Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier, beginning in 1913. Copeau's training included a varied and demanding schedule, regular exercise for agility and stamina, and pressing his cast and crew to invent theatrical effects in a bare-bones space. It was there Jouvet developed his considerable stagecraft skills, particularly makeup and lighting (he developed a kind of <b>accent</b> <b>light</b> named the jouvet). These years included a successful tour to the United States.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, {{the entrances}} were renovated {{to include a}} more modern appearance, {{a fresh coat of}} paint was added {{throughout}} the mall, and additional <b>accent</b> <b>lighting</b> near the skylights was installed.

Again that year, the mall added a TV area during the opening of Nordstrom.|$|E
50|$|<b>Accent</b> <b>lighting</b> focuses {{light on}} a {{particular}} area or object. It {{is often used to}} highlight art or other artifacts. Common types of accent lights include wall sconces, floodlights, recessed lights, torchère lamps, or track lighting. The brighter light from the accent lamp creates visual interest to a room. Accent lights may also be used to shine {{light on a}} stairway, or as in movie theaters, light a walkway.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{relatively}} high cost per watt, LED lighting is most useful at very low powers, typically for lamp assemblies of under 10 W. LEDs are currently most useful and cost-effective in low power applications, such as nightlights and flashlights. Colored LEDs {{can also be used}} for <b>accent</b> <b>lighting,</b> such as for glass objects, and even in fake ice cubes for drinks at parties. They are also being increasingly used as holiday lighting.|$|E
50|$|For 2013 the FJR1300 {{received}} {{a substantial number}} of updates, becoming the 'Gen-III' version. Bodywork is all new on the front half of the bike for better airflow and engine heat management, and a new faster-acting windshield mechanism was introduced. Front turn signal/position lights are now LEDs and there are LED <b>accent</b> <b>lights</b> around the headlights, and there is now one horn instead of two on prior years. In markets outside the US and Canada the AS (AutoShift) model received electrically adjustable suspension and inverted front forks - those suspension changes were introduced into the North American models in the following year as a model option known as the 'ES'.|$|R
50|$|A lamp with {{night light}} is often {{configured}} {{so that one}} of the two sockets is a medium-base socket, considered to be the Main Lamp (under the lamp shade), and the other socket is a candelabra-base socket that is the night <b>light</b> or decorative <b>accent</b> <b>light.</b> The night light is usually placed somewhere on or inside the body of the lamp. In a typical set-up, the main lamp would have a 150 W medium-base bulb, and the night light would have 7 W candelabra bulb. The operation of the switch is still the same, such that the night light comes on, then the main lamp, then both together, then it goes back to off.|$|R
50|$|In Japan, {{where the}} car was {{launched}} on 9 June 2010, orders totalled 10,943 units in its first month, surpassing Nissan's monthly target of 1,300. By 5 October 2010, Japanese sales had increased to 20,000 while European and US figures also exceeded expectations with orders for 30,000 and 17,500 cars taken for the respective markets.The Juke is sold in China as the rebadged Infiniti ESQ.In 2014, at the International Auto Show in Geneva, Nissan unveiled the revised Nissan Juke for 2015 model year, which went on sale {{in the summer of}} 2014.

50|$|The {{illuminated}} ceiling was once {{popular in the}} 1960s and 1970s but fell out of favor after the 1980s. This uses diffuser panels hung like a suspended ceiling below fluorescent lights, and is considered general lighting. Other forms include neon, which is not usually intended to illuminate anything else, but to actually be an artwork in itself. This would probably fall under <b>accent</b> <b>lighting,</b> though in a dark nightclub it could be considered general lighting.|$|E
50|$|The complex {{opened in}} 2003 as Qwest Center Omaha. It adopted its current name on July 15, 2011, {{as part of}} a $22 billion buyout of Qwest by CenturyLink (formerly CenturyTel).

500|$|John Kelso, a local {{newspaper}} columnist, says that the building resembles an enormous set of nose hair trimmers. Austin Chronicle readers voted the Frost Bank Tower as the [...] "Best New Building (Past Five Years)" [...] in 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008. It was also voted for best architecture in 2004 and 2005. The newspaper also says that the [...] "owl face of the Frost Bank Tower" [...] helps keep Austin [...] "characteristically weird", meaning that it makes Austin unique. The tower was awarded the 2005 International Association of Lighting Designers (IALD) Award of Merit for lighting design by Cline Bettridge Bernstein Lighting Design Inc. for its [...] "second set of narrowly focused <b>accent</b> <b>lights</b> that showcase the vertical mullions at the setback near the building top" [...] and [...] "monumental custom sconces that add scale and create a welcoming frame around the opening portals of the lobby". The building also won the 2003 Texas Construction Magazine Award of Merit.|$|R
50|$|Analysis {{of capital}} {{expenditures}} {{is used to}} determine appropriate asset classifications. Cost segregation identifies building costs that would typically be depreciated over a 27.5 or 39-year period and reclassifies them to permit a shorter, accelerated method of depreciation for certain building costs. Costs for non-structural elements, such as wall covering, carpet, <b>accent</b> <b>lighting,</b> portions of the electrical system, and exterior site improvements such as sidewalks and landscaping, can often be depreciated over five, seven or 15 years, rather than over 27.5 or 39 years.|$|E

5000|$|An LED Strip Light (also {{known as}} an LED tape or ribbon light) is a {{flexible}} circuit board populated by surface mounted light-emitting diodes (SMD LEDs) and other components that usually comes with an adhesive backing. Traditionally, strip lights had been used solely in <b>accent</b> <b>lighting,</b> backlighting, task lighting, and decorative lighting applications. Increased luminous efficacy and higher-power SMDs have allowed LED strip lights {{to be used in}} applications such as high brightness task lighting, fluorescent and halogen lighting fixture replacements, indirect lighting applications, Ultra Violet inspection during manufacturing processes, set and costume design, and even growing plants ...|$|E

50|$|The {{transitional}} ware of {{the early}} Kangxi decades witnessed a move away from designs and aesthetic standards of the painter Dong Qichang to newer tastes typified by the artist Shen Shitong and his use of western perspective. The influence of the artist Dong Qichang can be readily seen on ceramic ware of the period with its heavily <b>accented</b> <b>light</b> and dark tones. The change to Shen Shitung {{can be seen in}} generous vertical washes that create a definite foreground and background contrast. Kangxi transitional ware in its broadest sense is best appreciated and studied in Japan than in the west. The informality of design and shape appealed to Japanese taste and especially those involved in the tea ceremony. Palace-ware or imperial-ware has traditionally found many admirers in Europe and America. Kangxi reign marks on porcelain are few throughout the ceramic period, but a few can be identified with the pre1677 decades. Earlier Ming period marks can frequently be found. Their styles closely match the few Kangxi marks that are found and aid in delineating Kangxi transitional porcelain.|$|R
