500|$|... "Battlefield" [...] is a mid-tempo pop and R ballad. It also {{derives from}} the genres of pop rock and soft rock. The {{instrumentation}} of [...] "Battlefield" [...] consists of a bass, piano, drums, percussion and guitar. [...] "Battlefield" [...] is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 144 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G major with Sparks' vocal range spanning from the note of A3 to C6. The song's lyrics revolve around [...] "a tumultuous relationship where neither side wants to compromise", as stated by Jocelyn Vena of MTV News. Nick Levine of Digital Spy noted that [...] "Battlefield" [...] {{is based on the}} [...] "love is war" [...] metaphor. During the chorus, Sparks sings: [...] "I never meant to start a war / You know, I never wanna hurt you / Don't even know what we're fighting for / Why does love <b>always</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield."

Hopefully people who have stuck with us this long, and appreciate the fact that we aren’t trying to repeat ourselves with every album, will enjoy another slight turn sideways." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{hospital}} corpsman and sniper of a four-man reconnaissance {{and surveillance}} team, SEAL Team 10. Wahlberg {{was the first}} actor to sign on as a star of the film during its early stages of development. He agreed to portray Luttrell after reading Peter Berg's script. Wahlberg chose not to read Luttrell's book Lone Survivor during production to avoid arguments with Berg over events and details that were {{left out in the}} book. [...] "The problem when adapting a piece of material like that is that you <b>always</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> something is missing", he explained. [...] "I wanted to come at it from this perspective." [...] Of Wahlberg's portrayal, Luttrell stated, [...] "Wahlberg is a consummate professional, and he's a great actor. It was a little strange watching somebody trying to play me, but we talked about it and I knew it would turn out great. I was more worried about the other guys because they’re not around to speak for themselves." [...] Wahlberg has since cited Lone Survivor as his favorite film role as an actor and producer: [...] "This is the best working experience I’ve ever had, under the toughest conditions. I remember early on as an actor, you worked a long, hard day, but you did something you felt was special, and that car ride home you couldn’t stop thinking about it. I had that feeling every day on this movie." ...|$|E
500|$|The group {{initially}} invited Feldmann to hear its demos, and {{he suggested}} that the band regroup at his studio {{the next day to}} make a fresh start. The next day, the group wrote three songs, including the lead single [...] "Bored to Death". As the band continued to write and record, the trio chose to shelve their earlier recordings and proceeded to write 28 songs in a period of 3–4 weeks. Half of these songs were chosen to be put on the finalized album, in addition to two joke songs. Barker fought for all 28 songs to be on the album, as he felt fans had waited long enough for more new music. The trio, as well as Feldmann, regularly stayed in the studio for up to 18 hours a day. The band members would arrive at the studio with no plan for what to work on for the day. They would then write several songs in only a few hours, aiming to complete them {{by the end of the}} night. Feldmann asked the members to consider what Blink-182, as a group, are all about, to inspire the songwriting. He would encourage the musicians to write with speed, which Hoppus admitted could be frustrating. [...] "John was like, 'Okay: We've got the song structure. Write lyrics. Go in there and sing it. Go in there and sing it.' Sometimes, I was like, 'I'm not ready to sing!' (and Feldmann would reply) 'No. Go write something great right now!'" [...] Barker was more supportive of this method based on his work with the Transplants, which had a similar speedy approach. [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> your first instinct is your best," [...] Barker remarked.|$|E
2500|$|Jeff Landa {{gave the}} game a {{positive}} review for Electronic Gaming Monthly. He scored it a 9.0/10, praised the overall presentation and gameplay, and stated: [...] "Games like NBA 2K16 {{will tend to}} overreach in how it chooses to occupy your time outside of the virtual arena. This is where most players will find the fault with 2K16, as not every mode external to game time is as fleshed out or competent as the main course. Not every returning 2K player will welcome the minor adjustments to the control scheme. Some online hiccups will frustrate others, {{and the addition of}} a MyCareer that doesn’t <b>always</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> yours will split many down the middle. Still, NBA 2K16 remains a refined technical masterpiece that rewards rookies and veterans alike with a showcase that belongs in the basketball hall-of-fame." ...|$|E
60|$|Now it {{happened}} that the very day before Paddy the Beaver decided that his pond was big enough, and so allowed the water {{to run in the}} Laughing Brook once more, Farmer Brown's boy took it into his head to go fishing in the Smiling Pool. Just as usual he went whistling down across the Green Meadows. Somehow, when he goes fishing, he <b>always</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> whistling. Grandfather Frog heard him coming and dived into the little bit of water remaining in the Smiling Pool and stirred up the mud at the bottom so that Farmer Brown's boy shouldn't see him.|$|R
50|$|Patrick Schabe of PopMatters {{gave the}} album a glowing review, noting {{influence}} from some very successful artists: Spirit Touches Ground reveals elements of John Lennon, Stevie Wonder, Jeff Buckley, and {{a slew of}} musical influences, yet <b>always</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> a personal extension of Josh himself rather than imitation. And, as so many have noted in the past, there's his voice. Ever since his days in School of Fish, listeners and critics have noted that Clayton-Felt’s voice possessed a quality of clarity, emotion, and a beauty that helped drive his songs. Personal and intimate, his voice soars through the fourteen tracks of Spirit Touches Ground in a graceful, if unintentional, swan song.|$|R

The nine-track album, featuring [...] "Staring At All This Handle", [...] "Remember In Reverse" [...] along with seven brand new tracks, will come a bonus mixed version. Like their previous Delicacies album from 2010, the tracks are more club-focused than the experimental style found on Whorl.

Therefore the tone of the songs was very conversational. The listener <b>always</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> they are in the moment when that first line is uttered." [...] According to Manchester the genesis of [...] "Midnight Blue" [...] was a conversation she and Bayer Sager [...] "had about our young husbands, and how as young women we didn't know how to get through the hard times that every relationship has"; the song was essentially finished but still lacking a title when either Manchester or Bayer Sager said: [...] "Midnight Blue" [...] which Manchester opines [...] "was the perfect fit for the song's overall feeling".|$|R

5000|$|Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V.

[...] Sean Fitz-Gerald from Vulture gave the episode a mixed review by saying, [...] ""Sacred Couch" [...] is filled with those slight deviations that might lure some fans and turn off others.

6000|$|Mrs. Rock, to whom Hewson {{had been}} {{presented}} {{at the same time}} as to Miss Hernshaw, looked vaguely back at him over her shoulder, but made no attempt to include him in her group, and he thought, for no reason, that she was kept from doing so on account of Miss Hernshaw. He thought he could be no more mistaken in this than in the resentment of Miss Hernshaw, which he was aware of meriting, however unintentionally. Later, after lunch, he made sure of this fact when Mrs. Rock got him into a corner, and cozily began, [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> explaining Rosalie a little," [...] and then her vague, friendly eye wandered toward Miss Hernshaw across the room, and stopped, as if waiting for the girl to look away.

Why is Jack {{the only person}} capable of facing the dangerous Cherevin? How does he overpower a hit man built like a refrigerator? —Claudia Puig, writing for USA Today Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a positive review, saying, [...] "Under taut direction from Kenneth Branagh (who also plays the Russian heavy), Pine is convincing as a character who is pushing papers one day and dodging assassins in Moscow the next."
