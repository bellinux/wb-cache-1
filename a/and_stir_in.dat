On the landing {{on my way to}} bed there was a patch of darkness beyond a chest that became a lurking horror for me, and sometimes the door of my father's bedroom would stand open and there was a long buff and crimson-striped shape, by day indeed an ottoman, but by night--.

60|$|While these {{arrangements}} were in {{progress in the}} camp of Captain Bonneville, {{there was a sudden}} bustle <b>and</b> <b>stir</b> <b>in</b> the camp of Fontenelle. One of the partners of the American Fur Company had arrived, in all haste, from the rendezvous at Pierre's Hole, in quest of the supplies. The competition between the two rival companies was just now at its height, and prosecuted with unusual zeal. The tramontane concerns of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company were managed by two resident partners, Fitzpatrick and Bridger; those of the American Fur Company, by Vanderburgh and Dripps. The latter were ignorant of the mountain regions, but trusted to make up by vigilance and activity for their want of knowledge of the country.|$|E

Slaves--the underground trolls and iron-workers, magic, mischievous, and enslaved, of the ancient stories. But tall--the miners seemed to her to loom tall and grey, in their enslaved magic. Slaves who would cause the superimposed day-order to fall. Not because, individually, they wanted to. But because, collectively, something bubbled up in them, the force of darkness which had no master and no control. It would bubble <b>and</b> <b>stir</b> <b>in</b> them as earthquakes stir the earth. It would be simply disastrous, because it had no master. There was no dark master in the world. The puerile world went on crying out for a new Jesus, another Saviour from the sky, another heavenly superman. When what was wanted was a Dark Master from the underworld.|$|E

40|$|Background: Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging is a commonly used method of monitoring of soft tissue tumours. The {{aim of the}} work was to describe precisely the typical changes within soft tissues and bones occurring after radiotherapy in children treated for sarcomas and other soft tissue tumours. With time, the changes undergo evolution and their characteristics and comparison with previous examinations help in a difficult differentiation between tumour lesions and posttherapeutic changes. Material/Methods: Fifteen children and young adolescents (9 boys and 6 girls) aged between 2 and 22 years (mean age of 13. 4 years) with diagnosed aggressive soft tissue tumours, were treated with radiotherapy. There were 102 MRI examinations analysed in the period from February 2004 to February 2008. The examinations were performed with a 1. 5 T MRI scanner in the following sequences: SE T 1, SE T 1 +fatsat, before and after gadolinium administration (Gd), FSE T 2 <b>and</b> <b>STIR</b> <b>in</b> three planes, and, in some selected cases, a dynamic gadolinium-enhanced (DCE MRI) examination with FAME sequence. Histopathological examinations showed: rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) in 8 cases, synovial sarcoma – 3, agressive desmoid fibroma – 3, mesenchymoma mal. – 1. MRI examinations were performed at different postradiotherapeutic stages, several times in one patient (12 times at the most).
