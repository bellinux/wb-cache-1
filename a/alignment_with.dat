5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department {{assigned}} M-212 to {{its current}} alignment in Aloha Township from what was then US23 on December29, 1937. The route has remained mainly intact since its assignment. Originally, US23 ran along the highway at the eastern terminus of M-212, but the highway department realigned the highway onto an alignment along the shore of Lake Huron in 1940; that year, the highway department replaced the former US23 <b>alignment</b> <b>with</b> the designation of M-33, which has remained there since.|$|E
5|$|The second {{iteration}} has {{its origins}} with {{the formation of}} US-6. In 1937, US-6 was extended west from its former terminus at Greeley, Colorado to Long Beach, California. In eastern Utah the route used the existing alignment of US-50. However, in western Utah the route used an unpaved road through Delta reconnecting with US-50 in Ely. By 1954, this route was fully paved and US-50 was moved to this shorter <b>alignment.</b> <b>With</b> this change US-6/50 ran concurrent from Ely to Grand Junction, Colorado.|$|E

5|$|<b>Alignment</b> <b>with</b> the Indonesian government, however, did not {{guarantee}} safety for the Torajans. In 1965, a presidential decree required every Indonesian citizen {{to belong to}} one of five officially recognised religions: Islam, Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism), Hinduism, or Buddhism. The Torajan religious belief (aluk) was not legally recognised, and the Torajans raised their voices against the law. To make aluk accord with the law, {{it had to be}} accepted as part of one of the official religions. In 1969, Aluk To Dolo ("the way of ancestors") was legalised as a sect of Agama Hindu Dharma, the official name of Hinduism in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Astrology, in its {{broadest}} sense, is {{the search}} for meaning in the sky. Early evidence for humans making conscious attempts to measure, record, and predict seasonal changes by reference to astronomical cycles, appears as markings on bones and cave walls, which show that lunar cycles were being noted as early as 25,000 years ago. This was a first step towards recording the Moon's influence upon tides and rivers, and towards organising a communal calendar. Farmers addressed agricultural needs with increasing knowledge of the constellations that appear in the different seasons—and used the rising of particular star-groups to herald annual floods or seasonal activities. By the 3rd millennium BCE, civilisations had sophisticated awareness of celestial cycles, and may have oriented temples in <b>alignment</b> <b>with</b> heliacal risings of the stars.|$|E

5|$|Leopold's {{priority}} was to rest his leg. Wolfgang passed {{the time by}} composing a short minuet, K.122/73t, and a Miserere in A minor, K.85/73s. Meanwhile, the libretto for the Milan opera arrived; Leopold had been expecting Metastasio's La Nitteti, but it was Mitridate, re di Ponto, by Vittorio Cigna-Santi. According to the correspondence of Leopold, the composer Josef Mysliveček was a frequent visitor to the Mozart household while they were staying in Bologna. The musicologist Daniel E. Freeman believes that Mozart's approach to the composition of arias changed fundamentally at this time, bringing his style into closer <b>alignment</b> <b>with</b> that of Mysliveček.|$|E
5|$|National policy {{relating}} to the Cold War interested Flanders greatly. He {{was concerned about the}} world-wide encroachment of Communism even without force of arms. He felt that President Truman was generally a good president, but was hampered by the Roosevelt legacy of appeasing the Soviets. He also felt that Truman's commitment to bringing the Nationalist and Communist Chinese factions together into an alliance was mistaken. He endorsed the Marshall Plan as a way to avoid Communist influence in Western Europe. However, he was critical of John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State, for mishandling opportunities to create friendly <b>alignment</b> <b>with</b> Egypt and India, countries which instead sided with the Soviet Union.|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a semiautomated RNA sequence editor (SARSE) that integrates tools for analyzing RNA alignments. The editor highlights different properties of the alignment by color, and its integrated analysis tools prevent the introduction of errors when doing alignment editing. SARSE readily connects to external tools to provide a flexible semiautomatic editing environment. A new method, Pcluster, is introduced for dividing the sequences of an RNA <b>alignment</b> into subgroups <b>with</b> secondary structure differences. Pcluster {{was used to evaluate}} 574 seed alignments obtained from the Rfam database and we identified 71 <b>alignments</b> <b>with</b> significant prediction of inconsistent base pairs and 102 <b>alignments</b> <b>with</b> significant prediction of novel base pairs. Four RNA families were used to illustrate how SARSE can be used to manually or automatically correct the inconsistent base pairs detected by Pcluster: the mir- 399 RNA, vertebrate telomase RNA (vert-TR), bacterial transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), and the signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA. The general use of the method is illustrated by the ability to accommodate pseudoknots and handle even large and divergent RNA families. The open architecture of the SARSE editor makes it a flexible tool to improve all RNA <b>alignments</b> <b>with</b> relatively little human intervention.

5|$|The {{conservative}} Moderate {{opposition to}} Feijó had close links to coffee and sugar cane planter families and merchants in the Brazilian southeast and northeast. These groups wielded great political, {{social and economic}} influence. They began to see their interests more in <b>alignment</b> <b>with</b> men like Honório Hermeto, who were planters like themselves—people who supported the slave trade with Africa and desired a centralized state able to impose order. The often strongheaded Honório Hermeto, swallowing his pride, set aside his enmity toward Vasconcelos in pursuit of an alliance. Dubbed the Reactionary Party by Feijó and his allies in 1837, the conservative Moderate opposition born in late 1834 was the genesis of what would evolve into the Party of Order (c. 1843) and finally into the Conservative Party (c. 1853).|$|E
5|$|The meticulously {{designed}} buildings composing {{the larger}} Chacoan complexes did not emerge until around AD 1030. The Chacoans melded pre-planned architectural designs, astronomical alignments, geometry, landscaping, and engineering into ancient urban centers of unique public architecture. Researchers {{have concluded that}} the complex may have had a relatively small residential population, with larger groups assembling only temporarily for annual ceremonies. Smaller sites, apparently more residential in character, are scattered near the great houses in and around Chaco. The canyon itself runs along one of the lunar alignment lines, suggesting the location was originally chosen for its astronomical significance. If nothing else, this allowed <b>alignment</b> <b>with</b> several other key structures in the canyon.|$|E
40|$|Motivation: Accurate {{alignment}} {{of large numbers}} of sequences is demanding and the computational burden is further increased by downstream analyses depending on these <b>alignments.</b> <b>With</b> the abundance of sequence data, an integrative approach of adding new sequences to existing alignments without their full re-computation and maintaining the relative matching of existing sequences is an attractive option. Another current challenge is the extension of reference <b>alignments</b> <b>with</b> fragmented sequences, as those coming from next-generation metagenomics, that contain relatively little information. Widely used methods for alignment extension are based on profile representation of reference sequences. These do not incorporate and use phylogenetic information and are affected by the composition of the reference alignment and the phylogenetic positions of query sequences...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Proteins {{have evolved}} subject to {{energetic}} selection pressure for stability and flexibility. Structural similarity between proteins {{that have gone}} through conformational changes can be captured effectively if flexibility is considered. Topologically unrelated proteins that preserve secondary structure packing interactions can be detected if both flexibility and Sequential permutations are considered. We propose the FlexSnap algorithm for flexible non-topological protein structural alignment. Results The effectiveness of FlexSnap is demonstrated by measuring the agreement of its <b>alignments</b> <b>with</b> manually curated non-sequential structural alignments. FlexSnap showed competitive results against state-of-the-art algorithms, like DALI, SARF 2, MultiProt, FlexProt, and FATCAT. Moreover on the DynDom dataset, FlexSnap reported longer <b>alignments</b> <b>with</b> smaller rmsd. Conclusions We have introduced FlexSnap, a greedy chaining algorithm that reports both sequential and non-sequential alignments and allows twists (hinges). We assessed {{the quality of the}} FlexSnap alignments by measuring its agreements with manually curated non-sequential alignments. On the FlexProt dataset, FlexSnap was competitive to state-of-the-art flexible alignment methods. Moreover, we demonstrated the benefits of introducing hinges by showing significant improvements in the alignments reported by FlexSnap for the structure pairs for which rigid alignment methods reported <b>alignments</b> <b>with</b> either low coverage or large rmsd.
