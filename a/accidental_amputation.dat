40|$|Introduction: Traumatic {{cardiopulmonary}} arrest has a {{very high}} mortality, and survival of patients with this condition without neurological disability is rare. Presentation of case: We herein report a case of traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to <b>accidental</b> <b>amputation</b> of the left lower leg that was successfully treated without any higher brain dysfunction. Although the long duration of cardiopulmonary arrest in this patient suggested hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram showed normal findings. Discussion: This system may help intensivists evaluate the neurological conditions of patients with suspected hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy in the early stage of the clinical course and may assist in guiding therapeutic interventions. Conclusion: Our case supports the usefulness of neurological monitoring using amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{the technique of}} microsurgical penile replantation and a case followed up after two years. The patient {{was a young man}} with decom-pensated schizophrenia who emasculated himself with a kitchen knife. A particularly good functional result was achieved including restoration of sensation in the penile shaft and in the glans, and return of erectile capacity. Key words: penile replantation, functional result. Traumatic penile amputations are fortunately rare. The principal causes of penile amputation are self-emasculation in a schizophrenic person or in an intoxicated person with a severe personality disorder (6), amputation as a punish-ment by the wife to a philandering husband (as was common in Thailand in the 1970 s) (2), or <b>accidental</b> <b>amputation</b> as a complication of ritual circumcision in a child (11, 15). In the western world self-amputation by a psychotic person is the most common aetiology. Penile replantation was first reported by Ehrich (5) in 1929 using a macrosurgical technique. With re-establishment of the corpora cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum the organ survived quite reliably. However, after this procedure skin necrosis was a common compli-cation as was the formation of fistulas. Accord-ing to one technique the denuded shaft was therefore temporarily buried in the scrotum (2, 10). The first successful microsurgical re-plantations of an amputated penis were by Tamai et al. (13) and Cohen et al. (4) independently in 1976. The addition of the microneurovascular repair enabled complete survival of the organ with healing of the skin and return of erectile capacity. Since then microsurgical replantation of the penis has been reported several times, often as single case reports (7, 8, 14). A few review articles have also been presented in urological journals (1, 3, 9). However, as penile amputations are so rare, and plastic surgeons and microsurgeons therefore seldom get involved with the surgical treatment, we feel that it is worthwhile to report the replantation procedure and the particularly favourable outcome in this patient...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Malignant osseous foot tumours are uncommon. Their oncological {{outcomes}} {{have been}} poorly {{documented in the}} literature so far. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish the incidence and to evaluate the oncological outcomes of such patients. METHODS Our large orthopaedic oncology database was used to review 70 malignant osseous foot tumour patients. RESULTS: The age at diagnosis of malignant osseous foot tumours demonstrated a bimodal distribution peaking in the second and eighth decades of life. Overall, 55 primary malignant bone tumours of the foot (79 %) were identified. The median duration from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 52 weeks (interquartile range [IQR]: 17 - 104). Eight primary tumours (15 %) underwent an accidental excision (ie intralesional excision of a malignant bone tumour where some of the tumour has been left behind, also known as a 'whoops procedure') prior to referral to our unit. Forty-six patients (84 %) underwent surgery overall and thirteen of these developed recurrence or metastases. Seven of eight patients with a previous <b>accidental</b> excision underwent <b>amputation.</b> Fifteen osseous metastatic foot lesions were identified. The median length of foot symptoms to diagnosis was 24 weeks (IQR: 20 - 36 weeks). The median time to death following diagnosis of osseous foot metastases was 20. 1 months (IQR: 11. 3 - 27. 8 months). CONCLUSIONS: A high index of suspicion and awareness of clinical features of malignant osseous foot tumours are both essential to avoid diagnostic delays. Amputation is associated with a respectable outcome for patients who have undergone previous accidental excisions...|$|R
