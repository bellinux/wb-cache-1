5|$|After a subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} is confirmed, its origin {{needs to be}} determined. If the bleeding {{is likely to have}} originated from an aneurysm (as determined by the CT scan appearance), the choice is between cerebral <b>angiography</b> (injecting radiocontrast through a catheter to the brain arteries) and CT <b>angiography</b> (visualizing blood vessels with radiocontrast on a CT scan) to identify aneurysms. Catheter <b>angiography</b> also offers the possibility of coiling an aneurysm (see below).|$|E
5|$|Anatomy can {{be studied}} using both {{invasive}} and non-invasive methods {{with the goal of}} obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems. Methods used include dissection, in which a body is opened and its organs studied, and endoscopy, in which a video camera-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures. <b>Angiography</b> using X-rays or magnetic resonance <b>angiography</b> are methods to visualize blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|Brain AVMs may be {{detected}} on computed tomography <b>angiography</b> (CTA or CT angio) or magnetic resonance <b>angiography</b> (MRA); CTA is better in showing the vessels themselves, and MRA provides more {{detail about the}} relationship between an AVM and surrounding brain tissue. In general, MRI is recommended. Various types of vascular malformations may be encountered: AVMs, micro-AVMs, telangiectasias and arteriovenous fistulas. If surgery, embolization, or other treatment is contemplated (see below), cerebral <b>angiography</b> may be required to get sufficient detail of the vessels. This procedure carries a small risk of stroke (0.5%) and is therefore limited to specific circumstances. Recent professional guidelines recommend that all children with suspected or definite HHT undergo a brain MRI early in life to identify AVMs that can cause major complications. Others suggest that screening for cerebral AVMs is probably unnecessary in those who are not experiencing any neurological symptoms, because most lesions discovered on screening scans would not require treatment, creating undesirable conundrums.|$|E

40|$|Dural {{arteriovenous}} fistulas (DAVFs) {{may have}} aggressive symptoms, {{especially if there}} is direct cortical venous drainage. We report our preliminary experience in transarterial embolization of DAVFs with direct cortical venous drainage (CVR) using Onyx®. METHOD: Nine patients with DAVFs with direct cortical venous drainage were treated: eight type IV and one type III (Cognard). Treatment consisted of transarterial embolization using Onyx- 18 ®. Immediate post treatment <b>angiographies,</b> clinical outcome and late follow-up <b>angiographies</b> were studied. RESULTS: Complete occlusion of the fistula was achieved in all patients with only one procedure and injection in only one arterial pedicle. On follow-up, eight patients became free from symptoms, one improved and no one deteriorated. Late <b>angiographies</b> showed no evidence of recurrent DAVF. CONCLUSION: We recommend that transarterial Onyx® embolization of DAVFs with direct cortical venous drainage {{be considered as a}} treatment option, while it showed to be feasible, safe and effective...|$|R

5|$|If the {{symptoms}} of delayed ischemia do not improve with medical treatment, <b>angiography</b> may be attempted to identify the sites of vasospasms and administer vasodilator medication (drugs that relax the blood vessel wall) directly into the artery.

5|$|As {{an element}} with high {{electron}} density and atomic number, iodine absorbs X-rays weaker than 33.3keV {{due to the}} photoelectric effect of the innermost electrons. Organoiodine compounds are used with intravenous injection as X-ray radiocontrast agents. This application is often in conjunction with advanced X-ray techniques such as <b>angiography</b> and CT scanning. At present, all water-soluble radiocontrast agents rely on iodine.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{radial artery}} graft (RA) still {{involves}} two unsolved problems, namely, vasospasm and intimal hyperplasia, although satisfactory early and mid-term outcomes {{have been obtained}} recently. Methods: Two hundred patients underwent coronary artery bypass surgery with RA between October, 1996 and December, 2000. We made {{a comparison of the}} luminal diameters at early and mid-term periods in 23 patients who underwent mid-term <b>angiographies</b> after a mean follow-up of 27 months. The proximal anastomoses of the RA were the ascending aorta in these patients. The G/N ratio was determined as a ratio of the luminal diameter of the graft to that of the revascularized coronary artery so as to evaluate the luminal discrepancy between the graft and the native artery. Results: In the 122 patients who underwent <b>angiographies</b> about one month after the operation, the patency rate was 99 % (144 of 145) in the RA, 97 % (139 of 143) in the left internal thoracic artery graft (LITA), 96 % (75 of 78) in the saphenous vein graft (SV).

5|$|In the beginning, {{the major}} part of his work {{revolved}} around valvular and congenital diseases; later on he became interested in other areas. Every day, having hardly finished working in the operating room, Favaloro would spend hours and hours reviewing coronary angiograms and studying coronary arteries and their relation with the cardiac muscle. The laboratory of Sones, father of the coronary <b>angiography,</b> had the largest collection of angiograms in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Where {{there is}} still a corneal reflex or {{spontaneous}} motor response to painful stimulus but all other criteria are satisfied, or where any of the criteria cannot be performed but the remaining criteria are satisfied, the irreversible cessation of all brain functions can be determined by a combination of the criteria that have been satisfied and the performance of a supplementary test. These tests are cerebral <b>angiography</b> to confirm that there is no intracranial blood flow, and a radionuclide scan to confirm that there is no intracranial perfusion.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of calcium}} channel blockers, {{thought to be}} able to prevent the spasm of blood vessels by {{preventing}} calcium from entering smooth muscle cells, has been proposed for prevention. The calcium channel blocker nimodipine when taken by mouth improves outcome if given between the fourth and twenty-first day after the bleeding, even if it does not reduce the amount of vasospasm detected on <b>angiography.</b> In traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine does not affect long-term outcome, and is not recommended. Other calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate have been studied, but are not presently recommended; neither is there any evidence that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} the normal anatomical features and {{variations of the}} vertebrobasilar circulation and its branches in patients who underwent multidetector computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) <b>angiographies</b> of the brain. Methods. 135 patients (male, 83 and female, 52; mean age, 50. 1 years) who underwent CT or MR <b>angiographies</b> of the vertebrobasilar vasculature for various reasons were analyzed retrospectively. The right and left distal vertebral arteries (VAs), posterior inferior cerebellar arteries (PICAs), anterior inferior cerebellar arteries (AICAs), superior cerebellar arteries (SCAs), posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs), and posterior communicating arteries (PCoAs) were analyzed individually. Results. In 24. 4 % of the cases (33 / 135) right PICA, in 19. 3 % of the cases (26 / 135) left PICA, in 17. 8 % of the cases (24 / 135) right AICA, and in 18. 5 % of the cases (25 / 135) left AICA were absent. In cases without PICA or AICA, there was a statistically significant, moderately or well-developed AICA or PICA on the same side, respectively. The most common variation was isolated absence of right PICA and was seen in 17. 8 % of the cases. Conclusions. The anatomic features of {{the branches of the}} vertebrobasilar circulation may be different from well-known normal anatomy.

30|$|Since {{the early}} 1980 s, {{numerous}} investigations {{have been performed}} in this area (Rappaport et al. 1978). From the beginning on, the main interest lay in the perfusion of the large intracranial cerebral arteries as there was hope, that at that time used catheter <b>angiographies</b> could be avoided (Vatne et al. 1985).|$|R
5|$|Thrombolysis is enzymatic {{destruction}} of blood clots. This {{is achieved by}} the administration of a drug (such as urokinase or alteplase) that activates plasmin, an enzyme that occurs naturally {{in the body and}} digests clots when activated. Thrombolysis is an accepted treatment for heart attacks and stroke unrelated to dissection. In cervical artery dissection, only small case series are available. The thrombolytic drug is administered either intravenously or during cerebral <b>angiography</b> through a catheter directly into the affected artery. The data indicates that thrombolysis is safe, but its place in the treatment of VAD is uncertain.|$|E
25|$|While clots at the rupture site {{typically}} shrink {{in volume}} over time, {{some of the}} clot may become organized into fibrotic tissue resulting in narrowing of the artery lumen; the narrowings sometimes seen on <b>angiography</b> examinations, if severe enough. Since <b>angiography</b> methods can only reveal larger lumens, typically >>200 microns, <b>angiography</b> after a cardiovascular event commonly does not reveal what happened.|$|E
25|$|CT <b>angiography</b> {{can act as}} a less {{invasive}} {{alternative to}} Catheter <b>angiography.</b> Instead of a catheter being inserted into a vein or artery, CT <b>angiography</b> involves only the injection of a CT-visible dye into the arm or hand via an IV line. CT <b>angiography</b> lowers the risk of arterial perforation and catheter site infection. It provides 3D images that can be studied on computer, and also allows measurement of heart ventricle size. Infarct area and arterial calcium can also be observed (however those require a somewhat higher radiation exposure). That said, one advantage retained by Catheter <b>angiography</b> is the ability of the physician to perform procedure such as balloon angioplasty or insertion of a stent to improve blood flow to the artery.|$|E

For positioning patients on non breakable tabletops, positioning aids are available, i.e. inflatable cushions. Truly floating tabletops are not available with conventional OR tables. As a compromise, floatable <b>angiography</b> tables specifically made for surgery with vertical and lateral tilt are recommended. To further accommodate typical surgical needs, side rails for mounting surgical equipment like retractors or limb holders should be available for the table.|$|E
