5|$|During April 1940, No. 607 Squadron RAF {{was based}} at Saint-Inglevert, flying Gloster Gladiator Mk II HR aircraft. The {{military}} commander General Maxime Weygand visited the airfield on 21 May, and ordered 516 GAO to prepare to evacuate as the Germans {{were in the}} neighbouring Somme department. The following day, the order came to evacuate to Boos airfield, Rouen, Normandy, but only four of the ten aircraft that departed from Saint-Inglevert arrived safely at Boos. All aircraft carried as many passengers <b>as</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> accommodated. Two Potez 63-11's and a Bloch MB.152 were abandoned at Saint-Inglevert, and were destroyed to prevent their use by the enemy, as were supplies of fuel. Personnel from 516 GAO were evacuated from Dunquerque on the , although nineteen of them were killed when the ship struck a mine and sank.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{these events}} around Blenheim and Lutzingen were taking place, Marlborough was {{preparing}} to cross the Nebel. The centre, commanded by the Duke's brother, General Charles Churchill, consisted of 18 battalions of infantry arranged in two lines: seven battalions in the front line to secure a foothold across the Nebel, and 11 battalions in the rear providing cover from the Allied side of the stream. Between the infantry were placed two lines, 72 squadrons of cavalry. The first line of foot was to pass the stream first and march as far {{to the other side}} <b>as</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> conveniently done. This line would then form and cover the passage of the horse, leaving gaps in the line of infantry large enough for the cavalry to pass through and take their position in front.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> expected, {{immediately}} {{after he was}} inaugurated, Reitz contacted {{the government of the}} South African Republic with the objective to establish new and closer political ties. Already on 4 March 1889 the Orange Free State and the South African Republic concluded a treaty of common defence at Potchefstroom. Treaties about trade and the railways were to follow. Even earlier, in January 1889, the Volksraad charged Reitz to negotiate a customs treaty with both the British South African colonies and the South African Republic. On 20 March 1889 a Customs Conference was held in Bloemfontein which led to an agreement between the Orange Free State and the Cape Colony which was hugely beneficial for the former. The economic benefits grew further when new railway lines were opened between the Cape Colony and Bloemfontein (1890) and between Bloemfontein and Johannesburg (1892), directly connecting Cape Town with Johannesburg and turning the Orange Free State into a transit economy. For Reitz the development of a unified South African railway system was also a political goal: the railways as a means to diminish mutual distrust and create unity and mutual understanding between the white population of South Africa.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the raid on Sind and following the 1809 monsoon season, the British authorities in India decided to make a significant show of force against the Al Qasimi, in an effort not only to destroy their larger bases and as many ships <b>as</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> found, but also to counteract French encouragement of them from their embassies in Persia and Oman. Forces were gathered at Bombay during the summer: the small HEIC warships, Mornington, Aurora, Ternate, Mercury, Nautilus, Prince of Wales, Ariel and Fury joined by the bomb ketch Stromboli and the Royal Navy frigates HMS Caroline under Charles Gordon and Chiffone under John Wainwright, who was placed in command of the entire expeditionary force with the temporary rank of commodore. The force was complemented with troops seconded from the Bombay garrison, including a battalion of the 65th Foot, soldiers from the 47th Foot and an assortment of HEIC marines, engineers, artillery men and sepoys from the 2nd Bombay Native Infantry under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Lionel Smith of the 65th.|$|E

25|$|By 1937, {{plans were}} being {{finalised}} {{for the construction}} of several more hydro-electric plants. The plans called for stations at Poulaphouca, Golden Falls, Leixlip (all in Leinster), Clady, Cliff and Cathaleen's Fall (between Belleek and Ballyshannon in County Donegal), Carrigadrohid and Inniscarra (in County Cork). All these new plants were completed by 1949, and together harnessed approximately 75% of Ireland's inland water power potential. Many of these plants are still in operation – however <b>as</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> expected with continuing growth in demand their combined capacity falls far short of Ireland's modern needs.|$|E
25|$|In November Garland was {{cruising}} with {{a squadron}} off the northern coast of Santo Domingo. Sent {{to investigate a}} strange sail, she made little headway in the light winds. Unfortunately, towards evening, a current caught her close to shore and she grounded on the Caracole reef off Cap François. Despite efforts to lighten her, she took on water and fell on her side. The other vessels of the squadron came to her aid and took off her crew and such stores and provisions <b>as</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> saved. On 11 November, the day after she grounded, her crew set her on fire, which destroyed her.|$|E
25|$|The British {{once again}} sent ambassadors and Caesar, {{although}} he doubled {{the number of}} hostages, realised he could not hold out any longer and dare not risk a stormy winter crossing, Caesar had set out late in the campaigning season and the winter was approaching, and so allowed them to be delivered to him in Gaul, to which he returned with {{as many of the}} ships <b>as</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> repaired with flotsam from the wrecked ships. Even then, only two tribes felt sufficiently threatened by Caesar to actually send the hostages, and two of his transports were separated from the main body and made landfall elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{imagined}} {{many communities}} were {{vying for the}} new college after the bill became law on May 22, 1895. Delegates from Rockford, Freeport, Oregon, Dixon, Fulton and Polo began lobbying the selection committee for the new college {{to come to their}} towns. Every one of the communities in the running for the new college was a river town. Rockford, Oregon and Polo each had the scenic Rock River as inticement for the new college. Fulton had the Mississippi River. But DeKalb had only the Kishwaukee River, practically a creek compared to the Rock and, of course, the Mississippi. In July 1895 the selection committee, which included Judge A.A. Goodrich of Chicago, visited each of the communities in the running.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of a series of attacks in 1808 off the coast Sindh involving 50 Qasimi raiders and following the 1809 monsoon season, the British authorities in India decided to make a significant show of force against the Al Qasimi, in an effort not only to destroy their larger bases and as many ships <b>as</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> found, but also to counteract French encouragement of them from their embassies in Persia and Oman. By the morning of 14 November, the military expedition was over and the British forces returned to their ships, having suffered light casualties of five killed and 34 wounded. Arab losses are unknown, but were probably significant, while the damage done to the Al Qasimi fleets was severe: a significant portion of their vessels had been destroyed at Ras al-Khaimah.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{overlap in}} the {{influences}} of the two authors (<b>as</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> expected from writers working {{in the same time}} period and location), such as a common interest in thinkers like Augustine of Hippo. However, the primary focus and concern of each writer seems to set them apart. For example, most of the works attributed to Fulgentius the bishop deal with his opposition to heretical factions such as Arianism, a topic for which Fabius Fulgentius seems to have no concern. Topics on which the bishop seemed to have been strongly opinionated (Arianism, free-will, etc.) are never discussed in the mythographer’s work, even when a discussion of such things would seem to fit his discussion. From a linguistic standpoint, the mythographer’s unique style and inclusion of otherwise unused words and idioms is not replicated {{in the work of the}} bishop, which suggests further a negative identification.|$|E
