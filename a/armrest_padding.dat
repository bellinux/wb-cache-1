2500|$|Inside, the {{standard}} Charger featured a simulated wood-grain steering wheel, four individual bucket seats {{with a full}} length console from front to rear. The rear seats and rear center <b>armrest</b> <b>pad</b> also folded forward while the trunk divider dropped back, which allowed for generous cargo room. Numerous interior features were exclusive to the Charger including door panels, courtesy lights, as well as premium trim and vinyl upholstery. The instrument panel did not use regular bulbs to light the gauges, but rather electroluminescence lit the four chrome-ringed circular dash pods, needles, radio, shifter-position indicator in the console, as well as clock and air conditioning controls if equipped. The dash housed a 0 to 6000 rpm tachometer, a 0 to [...] speedometer, as well as alternator, fuel, and temperature gauges as standard equipment.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} was full leather, with full instrumentation in an engine-turned dash. As on early aircraft and custom boats, <b>padded</b> <b>armrests</b> were mounted outside the windows, a rare touch.|$|R
5000|$|Designed by Carl [...] "CAM" [...] Cameron, the Dodge Charger {{introduced}} a fastback roofline and a pot-metal [...] "electric shaver" [...] grille. The grille used fully rotating headlights (180 degree) that when opened or closed made the grille look like one-piece unit. Hidden headlamps were a feature not {{seen on a}} Chrysler product since the 1942 DeSoto. In {{the rear of the}} new Dodge, the fastback design ended over a full-width six-lamp taillight that featured chromed [...] "CHARGER" [...] lettering.Inside, the standard Charger featured a simulated wood-grain steering wheel, four individual bucket seats with a full length console from front to rear.

50|$|The {{top-line}} {{spot for}} 1959 {{was the new}} Galaxie, positioned above the continued Fairlane 500. The Custom line was dropped, with Custom 300 the lowest rung on the ladder, and all 1959 Fords used the long 118 in (2997 mm) wheelbase. New for safety was fully <b>padded</b> <b>armrests</b> and rear door locks that were child proof. American prices ranged from the mid-1,000 to the low 3,000s.|$|R
50|$|An {{electrically}} operated sliding steel sunroof was optional in 1962, the second automobile {{model in the}} world to have this option. The styling offered more interior and cargo room than the original Karmann Ghia. It featured an electric clock, three luggage spaces, built-in fog lights, round tail lights, upper and lower dash pads, door pads, and long <b>padded</b> <b>armrests.</b> It was the fastest production VW model of its day.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of construction materials and models. Bar stools are often made of wood or metal. Bar stools are made with and without <b>armrests,</b> backs, and <b>padding</b> or upholstery on the seat surface. Bar stools can range from basic wooden designs to more complex ones with adjustable height. Extra tall and extra short are common features, as well as indoor bar stools and outdoor bar stools. In commercial settings, swivel and floor mounted bar stools are common. Floor mounting renders the stool immovable, so it cannot be stolen or used as a weapon in a bar fight. Floor-mounted stools are generally mounted on a column, but stools with legs can also be secured to the floor using metal brackets.|$|R
2500|$|The big Buick of 1962 carried four VentiPorts per {{front fender}} and {{featured}} a rakish sculptured restyle of its 1961 guise. The hardtop coupe and standard hardtop sedan featured a convertible inspired semi-formal roofline, while the Riviera hardtop sedan {{continued to use}} six-window pillarless configuration. Electra 225 rear fenders had a group of vertical hashmarks, with Electra 225 spelled out in block letters just above. A full length bright strip crowned the upper [...] body ridge, while the tower rocker molding and wheelhouses were accented with bright trim. Wheelcovers had a gold accent ring. Interiors were of the finest cloth and, on the convertible, leather was used. Standard features included directional signals, full-flow oil filter, dual speed electric windshield washer/wipers, Deluxe steering wheel, cigar lighter, Step-on parking brake, dual <b>armrests,</b> Turbine-Drive transmission, <b>padded</b> dashboard, heater, defroster, glovebox light, back-up lights, power steering, Glare-proof rearview mirror, power brakes, power brake signal light, safety buzer, courtesy lights, two-way power seats, power windows, Super Deluxe wheelcovers, Safety option group, custom padded cushions, Accessory Group options and custom moldings.|$|R
40|$|Full-length {{portrait}} of a couple. The man, is depicted in profile, dressed in uniform and leaning on a sabre in a scabbard. He {{is sitting on the}} <b>armrest</b> of a <b>padded</b> bench. The woman is standing next to him, wearing a white, floor-length evening gown and an elaborate hat. Her right arm is resting on the man's left shoulder. They have been photographed in front of a painted canvas backdrop creating the impression the scene being set outdoors. Zora Horstig, née Pavlović, was the daughter of Mihajlo Pavlović, who was Governor of the National Bank and owned one of the largest Belgrade textile factories of the time. Zora's contemporaries used to call her 'Pretty Ms. Horstig'. She married Kosta Horstig, an artillery officer and descendant of an old Prussian family. Kosta's father, Paul von Horstig (Pavle Horstig), moved to Serbia after the Franco-Prussian War. There he became a representative of Krupp. Allegedly, he {{was also one of the}} founders of freemasonry in Serbia. Kosta and Zora had two daughters, one of them named Olga. The photograph is depicting Kosta's wife Zora and his sister Zorka...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} injuries following car-to-car side collisions. The injuries {{in this type of}} impact have been evaluated to form the basis for the development of test methods and for the principles of protective systems. Side impacts give rise to relatively more severe injuries than frontal impacts. The study has shown that the neck and the legs of the struck side occupant need to be better protected due to a high risk of permanent disabilities. The head, chest and abdomen/pelvis need to be better protected from a risk of life-threatening injuries. It has also been found that chest injuries increase significantly with age. Improved protection in side impacts can be achieved with car body/door reinforcements and compliant bolstering (padding and/or airbag) {{on the inside of the}} door. In order to develop and evaluate the principles of such protective systems a subsystem sled test method that simulates full-scale test conditions has been developed. The BioSid dummy was used. The use of a chest airbag (8 litre and unventilated) resulted in significantly lower loadings to the chest compared to (50 mm thick) compliant chest padding of polyethylene foam type, and significantly lower loadings to the head, neck and abdomen than a stiff reference door. Pelvis padding (75 mm thick) of the same material effectively reduced the pelvic loads. Both the acceleration based chest injury criterion TTI and the deformation based criterion VC were considerably reduced compared to a stiff door. The head ejection through the side window frame was reduced by an average of 30 mm. To further enhance the protection level, the airbag was increased to 12 litres in volume to cover both the chest and the abdomen down to the door armrest level. The effect of bag pressure and bag ventilation was investigated at two side impact severities. The ventilation of the bag reduced the maximum chest deflection by 30 % and the maximum chest viscous criterion, VC, by 50 % (comparison was made with the same bag without ventilation). A suitable initial bag (over) pressure was found to be about 40 kPa, when the loading of the abdomen was also taken into consideration. The deflection based criteria were found to be very sensitive to the door velocity. The stiffness of the bag corresponds to the tolerance level of the thorax of elderly people. The 12 litre ventilated side airbag resulted in 30 - 40 % lower chest deflection and about 60 % lower VC than 50 mm of another compliant chest padding material (Ethafoam 220 of polyethylene foam). TTI was 30 - 45 % lower. The findings from the evaluation of the airbag (size, initial pressure, ventilation) are also applicable to seat mounted side airbags of the type Autoliv has developed together with Volvo. To further improve the protection of the head/neck in side impacts a supplementary protective device "the curtain" at the side window has been proposed. In an investigation carried out together with the Birmingham University it was found that the optimum location for a side airbag sensor is the rear lower quadrant of the front door. A sensor located in this sector would cover almost 90 % of the impacts with risk of AIS 3 + injuries. A pendulum subsystem test method for the evaluation of sensors for side airbags has been developed and validated against low speed full-scale tests. The method has been used for evaluation of a pyrotechnical sensor. The sensor fires at impact speeds above 15 - 20 km/h, when there is a risk of life threatening (AIS 3 +) injuries to struck side occupants and not at low impact speeds (7 km/h), when the risk of injury is minimal. The principle finding in the study was that protective systems in side impacts must be softer than the corresponding human body segments. This was best accomplished with a ventilated side airbag for the chest and the abdomen (down to the <b>armrest</b> level) and <b>padding</b> for the pelvis and the leg. The proposed "curtain" will further enhance the head/neck protection...|$|R
