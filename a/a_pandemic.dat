5|$|During the 1990s, students, trade unionists, {{and other}} workers often {{demonstrated}} {{to express their}} growing discontent with Mugabe and Zanu-PF party policies. In 1996, civil servants, nurses, and junior doctors went on strike over salary issues. The general health of the population also began to significantly decline; by 1997 an estimated 25% of the population had been infected by HIV in <b>a</b> <b>pandemic</b> that was affecting most of southern Africa.|$|E
5|$|Early on, it {{was learned}} that {{diseases}} were species specific, {{so there was}} no danger of a disease or virus spreading to other races and potentially causing <b>a</b> <b>pandemic.</b> Extreme care is still taken, as there only has to be single instance of this not being the case to have deadly consequences.|$|E
5|$|This is a categorized, {{alphabetical}} list {{of people}} who are known to have been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the pathogen that causes AIDS, including those who have died. AIDS is <b>a</b> <b>pandemic.</b> In 2007, an estimated 33.2million people lived with the disease worldwide, and it killed an estimated 2.1million people, including 330,000 children. Over three-quarters of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>pandemic</b> is a {{worldwide}} epidemic. The 1918 flu pandemic, which lasted until 1919, was a category 5 influenza pandemic {{caused by an}} unusually severe and deadly influenza A virus. The victims were often healthy young adults, in contrast to most influenza outbreaks, which predominantly affect juvenile, elderly, or otherwise-weakened patients. Older estimates say it killed 40–50million people, while more recent research suggests {{that it may have}} killed as many as 100million people, or 5% of the world's population in 1918.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 {{another new}} {{strain of the}} virus emerged and caused <b>a</b> <b>pandemic</b> of Asian flu; {{although}} the virus was not as virulent as the 1918 strain, over one million died worldwide. The next pandemic occurred when Hong Kong flu emerged in 1968, a new strain of the virus that replaced the 1957 strain. Affecting mainly the elderly, the 1968 pandemic was the least severe, but 33,800 {{were killed in the}} US. New strains of influenza virus often originate in East Asia; in rural China the concentration of ducks, pigs, and humans in close proximity is the highest in the world.|$|E
5|$|Most {{researchers}} believe that HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century; it is now <b>a</b> <b>pandemic,</b> with an estimated 38.6million people now living with the disease worldwide. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate that AIDS has killed more than 25million people since it was first recognised on 5 June 1981, {{making it one of}} the most destructive epidemics in recorded history. In 2007 there were 2.7million new HIV infections and 2million HIV-related deaths.|$|E
50|$|Flu pandemics occur {{three to}} four times each century, and experts predict that <b>a</b> new <b>pandemic</b> {{influenza}} outbreak is inevitable. The group estimates that <b>a</b> severe <b>pandemic</b> flu outbreak could result in up to 1.9 million deaths, approximately 9.9 million new hospital patients, and an economic recession with losses of over $680 billion to the U.S. Gross Domestic Product.|$|R

25|$|The main ways {{available}} to tackle <b>a</b> flu <b>pandemic</b> initially are behavioural. Doing so requires a good public health communication strategy {{and the ability}} to track public concerns, attitudes and behaviour.

5|$|Bacteria can {{be grown}} in the {{laboratory}} on nutrient culture media, but viruses need living cells in which to replicate. Many vaccines to infectious diseases {{can be grown}} in fertilised chicken eggs. Millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements, a complex process that takes about {{six months after the}} decision is made as to what strains of virus to include in the new vaccine. A problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people with egg allergies are unable to be immunised, but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available. Cell-based culture will also be useful in <b>a</b> <b>pandemic</b> when {{it may be difficult to}} acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile, fertile eggs.|$|E
5|$|Hatoful Boyfriend {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} version of Earth in which sapient birds have seemingly taken the place of humans in society {{for reasons that are}} hinted at, but not fully explained in the dating simulation portion of the game. In Bad Boys Love, it is revealed that Hatoful is set in a post-apocalyptic, dystopian future—in which <b>a</b> <b>pandemic</b> of a deadly, mutated strain of the H5N1 virus, or bird flu, nearly wipes out mankind in the year 2068. The release of a counter-virus, cultivated to destroy the virus' avian carriers {{in a desperate attempt to}} stop the spread of the disease, ends up backfiring as birds who resisted the counter-virus instead developed human-level intelligence. War soon breaks out between the newly uplifted birds and the remnants of humanity, resulting in birds emerging as the planet's new dominant lifeforms as humans continued to succumb to the disease. Following several terrorist attacks by a human insurgency, all remaining humans have been forced to live in the wilderness away from civilization in a form of apartheid-like segregation.|$|E
5|$|Influenza spreads {{around the}} world in a yearly outbreak, {{resulting}} in about three to five million cases of severe illness and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths. In the Northern and Southern parts of the world, outbreaks occur mainly in winter while in areas around the equator outbreaks may occur at any time of the year. Death occurs mostly in the young, the old and those with other health problems. Larger outbreaks known as pandemics are less frequent. In the 20th century, three influenza pandemics occurred: Spanish influenza in 1918 (~50 million deaths), Asian influenza in 1957 (two million deaths), and Hong Kong influenza in 1968 (one million deaths). The World Health Organization declared an outbreak of a new type of influenza A/H1N1 to be <b>a</b> <b>pandemic</b> in June 2009. Influenza may also affect other animals, including pigs, horses and birds.|$|E

40|$|In this podcast Professor Robert Dingwall, Director of the 'Institute of Science and Society' at the University of Nottingham, and {{a member}} of the UK government’s Department of Heath {{committee}} on the ethical aspects of pandemic influenza, discusses the causes and potential impact of <b>a</b> flu <b>pandemic</b> on the UK. In particular, examining how prepared the UK government is to cope with the medical and social impacts of <b>a</b> flu <b>pandemic,</b> and what steps we can take as individuals to protect ourselves. In the last century, there were three separate flu pandemics, the most serious of which occurred in 1918, which is estimated to have resulted in the deaths of 50 million people worldwide. Professor Dingwall discusses the likelihood of another flu pandemic happening in the future and the differing methods available for protecting the population.

5|$|One {{theory that}} has been {{advanced}} is that the devastation in Florence caused by the Black Death, which hit Europe between 1348 and 1350, resulted in {{a shift in the}} world view of people in 14th-century Italy. Italy was particularly badly hit by the plague, and it has been speculated that the resulting familiarity with death caused thinkers to dwell more on their lives on Earth, rather than on spirituality and the afterlife. It has also been argued that the Black Death prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the sponsorship of religious works of art. However, this does not fully explain why the Renaissance occurred specifically in Italy in the 14th century. The Black Death was <b>a</b> <b>pandemic</b> that affected all of Europe in the ways described, not only Italy. The Renaissance's emergence in Italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors.|$|E
5|$|The film {{presents}} {{examples of}} crowd psychology and collective behavior {{which can lead}} to mass hysteria and the loss of social order. The bafflement, outrage, and helplessness associated with the lack of information, combined with new media such as blogs, allow conspiracy theorists like Krumwiede to spread disinformation and fear, which become dangerous contagions themselves. Dr. Cheever must balance the need for full disclosure but avoid a panic and allow the time to characterize and respond to an unknown virus. The movie indirectly critiques the greed, selfishness, and hypocrisy of isolated acts in contemporary culture and the unintended consequences they can have in the context of <b>a</b> <b>pandemic.</b> For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends social distancing by forcibly isolating the healthy to limit the spread of the disease, which stands in stark opposition to contemporary demands for social networking. Responding to the pandemic presents a paradox, as the contagiousness and lethality of the virus instills deep distrust of others but surviving and limiting the spread of the disease also requires individuals to work together.|$|E
5|$|The story also {{highlights}} {{examples of}} political cronyism (a plane to evacuate Dr. Mears from Minneapolis is instead diverted to evacuate a Congressman), platitudes and rigid thinking (public health officials consider postponing {{the closing of}} shopping malls until after the Thanksgiving shopping season), federal responders trying to navigate 50 separate state-level public health policies, and the heroism of Federal bureaucrats. Soderbergh does not use type-cast pharmaceutical executives or politicians as villains, but instead portrays bloggers such as Krumwiede in a negative light. Social media {{plays a role in}} Krumwiede's accusations against Dr. Cheever and in Emhoff's daughter's attempts to carry on a relationship with her boyfriend through text messaging. Other responses in the movie, such as Emhoff's appropriating a shotgun from a friend's abandoned house to protect his home from looters, imposition of federal quarantines and curfews, the allocation of vaccines by lottery, inadequate federal preparation and responses, and use of bar-coded wristbands to identify the inoculated highlight the complex tensions between freedom and order in responding to <b>a</b> <b>pandemic.</b> Soderbergh uses Emhoff to illustrate the micro-effects of macro-level decisions.|$|E

5|$|The {{story begins}} {{branching}} into different timelines {{that can be}} experienced in any order, depending on the choices made by the player. While completing {{the first set of}} puzzle rooms, the participants learn of <b>a</b> <b>pandemic</b> caused by Radical-6, a virus that slows down its victims' cognition and drives them to suicide. Depending on the given timeline, the characters also discover either the murdered body of an old woman or antimatter bombs. The other participants' backstories are explored: Luna is a humanoid robot, tasked with maintaining the Nonary Game; K was raised by Zero Sr. inside of the facility; Tenmyouji willingly joined the game, together with his adopted grandson Quark, after being promised a chance to find a certain woman; Alice and Clover are government secret agents tasked with stopping the religious cult Free the Soul; and Dio is a member of Free the Soul.|$|E
5|$|These {{troubles}} {{were followed}} in 1347 by the Black Death, <b>a</b> <b>pandemic</b> that spread throughout Europe {{during the following}} three years. The death toll was probably about 35 million people in Europe, {{about one-third of the}} population. Towns were especially hard-hit because of their crowded conditions. Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited, and in some places fields were left unworked. Wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available workers to their fields. Further problems were lower rents and lower demand for food, both of which cut into agricultural income. Urban workers also felt that they had a right to greater earnings, and popular uprisings broke out across Europe. Among the uprisings were the jacquerie in France, the Peasants' Revolt in England, and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders. The trauma of the plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe, manifested by the foundation of new charities, the self-mortification of the flagellants, and the scapegoating of Jews. Conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague {{throughout the rest of the}} 14th century; it continued to strike Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages.|$|E

During <b>a</b> flu <b>pandemic</b> causing mass fatalities, the limited morgues and decedent storage space at most health care facilities will be quickly overwhelmed. The proposed solution consists of temporary morgues, known as Body Collection Points (BCPs), at health care facilities.
