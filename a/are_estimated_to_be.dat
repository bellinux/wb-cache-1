5|$|The {{evolutionary}} history {{of life on}} Earth traces the processes by which living and fossil organisms evolved since life appeared on the planet, until the present. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years (Ga) ago and {{there is evidence that}} life appeared as early as 4.1 Ga. The similarities among all present-day organisms indicate the presence of a common ancestor from which all known species have diverged through the process of evolution. More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived on Earth <b>are</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> extinct. Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.9 million are estimated to have been named and 1.6 million documented in a central database to date.

5|$|Business {{aviation}} {{has shown}} strong growth, although {{the numbers of}} aircraft on the UK register have declined. This reflects a shift away from turboprop aircraft towards foreign-registered business jets based in the UK, which <b>are</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> growing in numbers. However, twin piston-engined aircraft numbers have declined significantly, reflecting pressures on the light air-taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper scheduled services, and a more sophisticated corporate charter business. The amount of flight training conducted by UK schools has declined, largely {{at the hands of}} competition from foreign schools, which benefit from lower costs and better weather.|$|E

As of 2017, only about 2,000 ring-tailed lemurs <b>are</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> left in the wild, making the threat of extinction far more serious for them than previously believed.|$|E

5|$|The black currawong is {{evaluated}} as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} {{has also}} been rated as least-concern.

5|$|The {{standard}} reduction {{potential of}} the E°(No3+→No2+) couple was estimated in 1967 to be between +1.4and+1.5V; it was later found in 2009 to be only about +0.75V. The positive value shows that No2+ is more stable than No3+ and that No3+ is a good oxidizing agent. While the quoted values for the E°(No2+→No0) and E°(No3+→No0) vary among sources, the accepted standard estimates are −2.61and−1.26V. It has been predicted that the value for the E°(No4+→No3+) couple would be +6.5V.

Around three-fourth of the populations survive in protected areas. Populations of the reedbuck are either declining or uncertain in Boucle du Baoulé National Park (Mali); Comoé National Park (Ivory Coast); Mole and Digya National Parks (Ghana). Numbers in the Akagera National Park, where its last-known populations in Rwanda exist, have seen a steep fall.|$|E
