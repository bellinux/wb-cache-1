50|$|Tilapia {{have been}} {{introduced}} into Laguna Junco, a volcanic caldera in the Galapagos Islands. Within the caldera, there is an absence of native freshwater fish.

40|$|The “global village” has {{resulted}} in the need to tackle cross-cultural issues in the medical school curriculum. The southern region of Israel (the Negev) provides a unique opportunity to study the interaction between medicine and culture. The Negev population is a multicultural society, with Bedouin Arabs comprising almost a fifth of its population. This imposes tremendous challenges to the medical establishment in the region and serves as a “cross-cultural laboratory” for educating medical students in global health issues. Both the traditional Israeli medical school track, as well as the newly established Medical School <b>for</b> <b>International</b> <b>Medicine,</b> incorporate studies of cross-cultural issues in various forms and to different degrees. Studies suggest that the exposure of students to international medical experiences increases their cross-cultural sensitivity and knowledge.

These contradictions relate to the sustainability of such programs, collaboration and partnerships between the National Department of Education, universities, donor agencies and scholars who advocate for authentic education for Papua New Guinea...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{framework}} incorporating a multi-agent system (MAS) that enables <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> <b>international</b> effect-based operation in emergency situations. The outcome is to empower emergency personnel, which can support collaboration between different international services by informing them about the emergency, matching competences and resources of the teams and volunteers. The challenge in emergency contexts is the abbreviations forming an information-carrying structure, which is especially important when abbreviations are exchanged between different services like rescue, military and emergency. We propose a framework, which provides the right information, rescue team, and services at the right place. The MAS can support information dissemination in dynamic situations in context, {{based on the information}} extraction and matching of the contents of the underlying ontologies. In the framework the system poses a sensible solution to the international rescue teams’ need of a high quality handling of life critical situations.

40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade in promoting trade – both exports and imports – and conditions which tend to make it most effective. The review provides abundant {{evidence to suggest that}} <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade is indeed broadly correlated with increases in trade. <b>Aid</b> <b>for</b> trade works best when it is focused on reducing the costs of trading through improvements in infrastructure, trade facilitation, trade-related public institutions (such as customs, standards administration, and export promotion), and polices (including eliminating policy barriers to competition). <b>Aid</b> <b>for</b> trade – in varying forms – directed to low income countries is particularly helpful in promoting trade. Analysis in this chapter suggests that <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade destined to low and lower-middle income countries is likely to have a high pay-off. Typically, one dollar invested in <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade is associated with an increase of nearly USD 8 of exports from all developing countries – while one dollar of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade to <b>International</b> Development Association (IDA) -eligible poorest countries amounted to US 20 in new exports and to USD 9 for all low and lower-middle income countries...|$|R
