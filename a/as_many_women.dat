The World Health Organization recommends a daily intake of 250µg for pregnant and breastfeeding women. <b>As</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> will not achieve this from dietary sources alone, the American Thyroid Association recommends a 150µg daily supplement by mouth.|$|E

25|$|Approximately twice <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> as men are {{prescribed}} benzodiazepines. It {{is believed}} that this is largely because men typically turned to alcohol to cope with stress and women to prescription drugs. Biased perception of women by male doctors may {{also play a role}} in increased prescribing rates to women; however, increased anxiety features in women does not account for the wide gap alone between men and women.|$|E
25|$|There {{were about}} 125.9 million adult {{women in the}} United States in 2014. The number of men was 119.4 million. At age 85 and older, there were almost twice <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> as men (4 million vs. 2.1 million). People under 21 years of age made up {{over a quarter of}} the U.S. {{population}} (27.1%), and people age 65 and over made up one-seventh (14.5%). The national median age was 37.8 years in 2015.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{annual survey}} by the Entertainment Software Association showed that nearly <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> played video games (48%) as men, and this broader {{audience}} began to question some assumptions and tropes that had been common in games. Shira Chess and Adrienne Shaw wrote that concern over these changes is integral to Gamergate, especially a fear that sexualized games aimed primarily at young men might eventually be replaced by less sexualized games marketed to broader audiences.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{women being}} {{seemingly}} independent in Taíno society, {{coming into the}} era of contact Spaniards took Taíno women as an exchange item, putting them in a non-autonomous position. Dr. Chanca, a physician who traveled with Christopher Columbus, reported in a letter that Spaniards took <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> as they possibly could and kept them as concubines. Some sources report that, despite women being free and powerful before the contact era, they became the first commodities up for Spaniards to trade, or often steal. This {{marked the beginning of}} a lifetime of theft and abuse of Taíno women.|$|E
25|$|Socioeconomic {{status of}} mothers likely has a larger {{influence}} on breastfeeding adherence than race or ethnicity, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> {{who are members}} of groups with low breastfeeding rates also have a low socioeconomic status. Among women born in the United States, women who are wealthier are more likely to breastfeed. In addition, employment can influence the decision to breastfeed. When either parent was unemployed or held a lower-status occupation (such as labor or sales), their children were more likely to never have been breastfed. In addition, women with public insurance or with no health insurance are more likely to never have breastfed their children, as are women who receive WIC.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Booth {{could not}} have {{accomplished}} so much {{if she had been}} hampered, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> are, by conditions demanding exertion in other than her chosen path, and without the comfort about her of a perfect home. She lived in the city of New York, in the neighborhood of Central Park, in a house which she owned, with her sister by adoption, Mrs. Anno W. Wright, between whom and herself there exists one of those lifelong and tender affections which are too intimate and delicate for public mention, but which are among the friendships of history, — a friendship that was begun in childhood and that cannot cease in death.|$|E

25|$|Cameron, meanwhile, was {{attracting}} sharp {{criticism from}} both the colonist press and Grey himself {{about the lack of}} progress in the eight weeks since Ngaruawahia's capture. Finally, on the night of 20 February, he set out on the narrow bush track to bypass Paterangi with 1230 men led by one of his guides and the Forest Rangers, leaving a large masking force in front of Paterangi. The force marched through rough bush in silence and complete darkness, passing within 1500 metres of the Paterangi pā without detection and arriving in Te Awamutu at dawn. They advanced to the town of Rangiaowhia, where they encountered about 100 men as well <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> and children. Many of the village's residents retreated to their raupo huts and one of the village's two churches and opened fire, while others gathered in the second church to surrender. The Rangers began advancing through the village, exchanging fire with their foe, hidden in their homes. About a dozen homes were set alight—either accidentally or intentionally—adding to the Māori toll. The British claimed they killed 12 Māori, including two chiefs, and took 30 prisoners. Their own losses totaled five, including several officers.|$|E

2500|$|Domestic {{violence}} {{covers a}} wide range of gender-targeted crimes such as rape and honor killings. <b>As</b> <b>many</b> <b>women,</b> who make up a majority of the victims, deny they are facing domestic violence, there are not enough reliable statistics on Domestic violence.

2500|$|Women fear {{dying from}} breast cancer more than dying from heart disease, even though, as of 2006, eleven times <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> died from heart disease as {{from breast cancer}}. [...] According to {{cardiologist}} Lisa Rosenbaum, {{this may be because}} women [...] "view heart disease as the consequence of having done something bad, whereas to get breast cancer is to have something bad happen to you".|$|E
2500|$|One {{result of}} breast cancer's high {{visibility}} is that statistical results {{can sometimes be}} misinterpreted, such as the claim that one in eight women will be {{diagnosed with breast cancer}} during their lives—a claim that depends on the unrealistic assumption that no woman will die of any other disease before the age of 95. [...] This obscures the reality, which is that about ten times <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> will die from heart disease or stroke than from breast cancer.|$|E

2500|$|During the 20th century, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> became {{better educated}} and {{more able to}} support themselves, fewer women found {{satisfaction}} {{in the position of}} being a mistress and {{were more likely to be}} in relationships with unmarried men. As divorce became more socially acceptable, it was easier for men to divorce their wives and marry the women who, in earlier years, might have been their mistresses. The practice of having a mistress continued among some married men, especially the wealthy. Occasionally, men married their mistresses. The late Sir James Goldsmith, on marrying his mistress, Lady Annabel Birley, declared, [...] "When you marry your mistress, you create a job vacancy".|$|E
2500|$|... {{measurement}} {{is difficult}} {{in part because}} there was great variation, geographically, by age and by gender, {{in the level of}} unemployment. Statistics collected by historian Peter Spearritt show 17.8 per cent of men and 7.9 per cent of women unemployed in 1933 in the comfortable Sydney suburb of Woollahra. (This {{is not to say that}} 81.9 per cent of women were working but that 7.9 per cent of the women interested/looking for work were unable to find it, a much lower figure than maybe first thought, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> stayed home and were not in the job force in those years, especially if they were unable to find work.) ...|$|E

Ralph Steiner recalled that [...] "he didn't press hard for absolute perfection, but always found something to praise, [...] won him the worship of a lot of ladies."
