30|$|Hypothesis 2 {{predicted}} that perceived team creative efficacy can mediate the {{positive relationship between}} leader creativity as perceived by team members and OCB. We followed Baron <b>and</b> <b>Kenny’s</b> (1986) mediation process. Hypothesis 1 passed {{the first step of}} Baron <b>and</b> <b>Kenny’s</b> (1986) mediation process. For the following three steps, in Step 1, we found that perceived leader creativity is significantly related to perceived team creative efficacy (γ =  0.694, p < . 01). In Step 2, perceived team creative efficacy was found to be significantly related to OCB (γ =  0.276, p <  0.1). For Step 3, when we added the perceived team creative efficacy into Model 4, as shown in Model 6, leader creativity was no longer significantly related to OCB while team creative efficacy is significantly related to OCB (γ =  0.188, p <  0.1), which meant that perceived team creative efficacy fully mediates the relationship between leader creativity and employee OCB. In general, we passed Baron <b>and</b> <b>Kenny’s</b> (1986) mediation process and provided support for Hypotheses 2.|$|R
