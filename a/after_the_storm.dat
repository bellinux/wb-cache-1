5|$|Typhoon Linda caused {{considerable}} {{deaths in}} Vietnam. Many fishermen and sailors were caught at sea {{in the path}} of the storm, unable to escape its path. Within three days, the death toll in Vietnam was set at over 150, with thousands missing, many of them fishermen. By the fourth day <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> the toll reached 390, and on November 14, eight days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> the death toll reached 464. Ultimately, the death toll was set at 3,111. Eight days after Linda's passage, a United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) report indicated 857people were injured by the storm. The government quickly established search and rescue teams, particularly for missing fishermen, and a total of 3,513 people were rescued <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b> In the weeks <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> hundreds of dead bodies washed ashore in Vietnam and Thailand.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{death toll}} was unknown, but {{believed}} to be several hundred. About two days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> the official death toll was more than 80. By three days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> the toll rose to 190, and by four days after it made landfall, the official total was 290deaths; officials estimated the toll could have exceeded 500. Due to downed communications, reports of storm fatalities were slow to spread, though news became more rapid as links were repaired. On November19, a week <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> struck, the Mexican Army set the final death toll at 436deaths, with 300missing; the death toll was later reported by the United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance in 1993.

5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> {{approximately}} 100,000people {{were facing}} starvation. Then-Haitian president Louis Borno {{reported that the}} government had inefficient resources for recovery and asked citizens to assist with repairing infrastructure and providing food and shelter to others. The Government of Haiti, in turn, appropriated $200,000 for relief. Eleven storages with relief supplies were established throughout the country. The approximately 10,000people left homeless were temporarily houses in larger, undamaged buildings. Within a few months <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> 299homes were rebuilt or repair, costing almost $37,000.

5|$|Cape Fear {{experienced}} minor beach erosion. The erosion, {{combined with}} high waves, washed out {{a portion of}} a roadway. The heavy rainfall in the Outer Banks disabled over 200cars and flooded nearly 500. Strong wind gusts left around 10,000buildings without power. Many places were not restored for two to three days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b> Wind and storm surge damaged over 100houses and buildings. Damage amounted to about $7.5million (2004USD). Two days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> passed, a man drowned off of Nags Head from strong rip currents and waves. This was the only direct casualty from the storm.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> {{the hardest hit}} {{residents}} faced food shortages and lacked access to clean water, in an area already facing ongoing food shortages. In response, the World Food Programme and other agencies of the United Nations created a program to feed about 350,000people in the region over three months, providing about 5,900tons of food. In the months <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> roads were repaired, including the link from Vangaindrano to Midongy. Farmers grew additional beans and potatoes {{to compensate for the}} damaged crops, while the quick distribution of food prevented significant malnutrition. In the subsequent years, about 40% of the forest at Manombo that regrew following Gretelle was of foreign nature, which threatened the original plants in the region.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the long}} term, {{residents}} lost {{significant amounts of}} income in the storm-affected areas, particularly farms in the year <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b> Higher food prices also resulted in less income for other residents.

5|$|Some {{sections}} of coastline already suffering from severe erosion lost additional swaths of beach to a 10-foot (3m) storm surge and strong waves. Many fishermen before and <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> encountered diminished fish catches after the hurricane.|$|E
