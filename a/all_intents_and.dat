5|$|Heydrich was, for <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> purposes, {{military}} dictator of Bohemia and Moravia. His {{changes to}} the government's structure left President Emil Hacha and his cabinet virtually powerless.

5|$|Nonetheless, the Portuguese {{presence}} on the Angolan coast remained limited {{for much of the}} colonial period. The degree of real colonial settlement was minor, and, with few exceptions, the Portuguese did not interfere by means other than commercial in the social and political dynamics of the native peoples. There was no real delimitation of territory; Angola, to <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> purposes, did not yet exist.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Zrínyi saw {{action in}} the Adriatic Sea. She served with the Second Division of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's battleships and shelled Senigallia {{as part of the}} {{bombardment}} of the key seaport of Ancona, Italy, during May 1915. However, Allied control of the Strait of Otranto meant that the Austro-Hungarian Navy was, for <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> purposes, effectively bottled up in the Adriatic. Nonetheless, the presence of the Zrínyi and other battleships tied down a substantial force of Allied ships.|$|E

60|$|Castle Richmond, too, {{would have}} been a dull house, as Lady Fitzgerald had intimated, had it not been that there was a common subject of such vital {{interest}} to the whole party. On that subject they were <b>all</b> <b>intent,</b> <b>and</b> on that subject they talked the whole evening, planning, preparing, and laying out schemes; devising how their money might be made to go furthest; discussing deep questions of political economy, and making, no doubt, many errors in their discussions.|$|R
5|$|Having been {{ratified}} by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states (27 of the 36 states, including those {{that had been in}} rebellion), Secretary of State Seward, on December 18, 1865, certified that the Thirteenth Amendment had become valid, to <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> purposes, {{as a part of the}} Constitution. Included on the enrolled list of ratifying states were the three ex-Confederate states that had given their assent, but with strings attached. Seward accepted their affirmative votes and brushed aside their interpretive declarations without comment, challenge or acknowledgment.|$|E

Byers explains to Susanne Modeski that, for <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> purposes, she is deceased and {{that she has a}} new identity. She asks Byers to go with her to start a new life, but he explains he has to keep up the fight. She kisses him goodbye and hands over a wedding ring meant for Grant Ellis.|$|E
5|$|With the Ordos now {{adequately}} fortified, the Mongols avoided {{its walls}} by riding east to invade Datong and Xuanfu (宣府; present-day Xuanhua, Hebei Province), which were two major garrisons guarding {{the corridor to}} Beijing where no walls had been built. The two defence lines of Xuanfu and Datong left by the Northern Qi and the early Ming had deteriorated by this point, and for <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> purposes the inner line was the capital's main line of defence.|$|E

Working with strong, deft fingers she soon had the work completed, and the two stepped out upon the roof, to <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> <b>and</b> purpose genuine Wieroos. Besides his pistol Bradley carried the sword of the slain Wieroo prophet, while the girl was armed with the small blade of the red Wieroo.|$|R
50|$|Nirit {{was founded}} on January 19, 1982 and was named after an {{indigenous}} plant, Ridolfia segetum, growing nearby. It expanded twice, once in 1986-1988 and again in 2000. Until 1986 there were only 15 families in temporary buildings, and nowadays it grew to about 240 families. In 2005 a new neighborhood named Nof Hasharon was built adjacent to Nirit. This neighborhood is located just outside the Green Line, actually belongs to the settlement Alfei Menashe, but in reality merged with Nirit for <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> <b>and</b> purpose.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the decline}} of the Mughal power, the region of Deccan saw the rise of Maratha Empire. The Nizam himself saw many invasions by the Marathas in the 1720s, which {{resulted}} in the Nizam paying a regular tax (Chauth) to the Marathas. The major battles fought between the Marathas and the Nizam include Palkhed, Bhopal, Rakshasbhuvan, and Kharda, in all of which the Nizam lost. Following the conquest of Deccan by Bajirao I and the imposition of chauth by him, Nizam remained a tributary of the Marathas for <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> <b>and</b> purposes.|$|R
5|$|Although {{formally}} {{separate from}} Greek Orthodox and Latin (Catholic) Christians, the Armenians consider their quarter {{to be part}} of the Christian Quarter. The three Christian patriarchates of Jerusalem and the government of Armenia have publicly expressed their opposition to any political division of the two quarters. The central reasons for the existence of a separate Armenian Quarter is the miaphysitism and distinct language and culture of the Armenians, who, unlike the majority of Christians in Jerusalem (also in Israel and Palestine), are neither Arab nor Palestinian. However, for <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> purposes, the Armenians living in the Armenian Quarter are considered Palestinians by Israel and the United Nations (UN). They have faced many of the same restrictions on their lives as have the Palestinians.|$|E
5|$|As the French {{constructed}} further fortifications, Luftwaffe {{reconnaissance aircraft}} {{picked up the}} activity and reported it. The steep slopes {{on the banks of}} the Meuse, added to what appeared in photographic reconnaissance to be a formidable barrier of bunkers and defence lines, caused Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander in chief of Army Group A, to question the wisdom of Guderian in choosing Sedan as the point of maximum effort. To identify how strong these fortifications were, a team of photographic specialists were called in to evaluate the pictures. Their analysis concluded that what appeared to be strong fortified positions were just the construction sites of half-built bunkers that were, to <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> purposes, empty shells. The contribution of the specialists tilted the Sedan attack plan into Guderian's favour.|$|E

5|$|The dam was completed, and Beaver Lake was at {{full height}} by June 1966. For <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> purposes, Harvey's Monte Ne was gone. However, {{in times of}} drought, some of the {{structures}} become visible again. The lake dropped to its lowest level on January 22, 1977, more than 27feet (8m) below its average depth, and the amphitheater and bridges were visible {{for the first time}} in more than 10 years. Before the water flooded downtown Monte Ne again, the rest of the buildings were either bulldozed or moved to avoid problems for swimmers, boaters, and fishermen. The few bridges that spanned the lagoon and the amphitheater were not demolished.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{components}} would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; {{one in the}} UK and one in France, To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser range-finder and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining {{the illusion of a}} shared design, the British design de facto departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 {{to such a degree that}} it was for <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> purposes a new design.|$|E
5|$|Theodore's brother Manuel, {{who managed}} to escape from Klokotnitsa, now took over the throne in Thessalonica. His domain was reduced to the environs {{of the city and}} his family's core territories in Epirus and Thessaly, as well as Dyrrhachium and Corfu, while his brother Constantine in Aetolia and Acarnania {{recognized}} his suzerainty. As a son-in-law of John Asen, Manuel was allowed to maintain internal autonomy, but to <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> purposes he was a client of the Bulgarian Tsar. At about the same time, Michael I's bastard son Michael II returned from exile and quickly succeeded, apparently {{with the support of the}} local population, in taking over control of Epirus. Manuel was forced to recognize the fait accompli under the pretense that Michael recognized his suzerainty, in token of which Manuel conferred him the title of Despot. In reality Michael was fully independent, and very quickly ceased to acknowledge Manuel's suzerainty; by 1236, he had seized Corfu. In order to preserve some freedom of manoeuvre and counter Asen's attempts to subordinate the Epirote Church to the Bulgarian Church of Tarnovo, Manuel turned to his brother's erstwhile rivals in Nicaea and brought an end to the ecclesiastical schism by acknowledging the legitimacy and superiority of the Nicaea-based Patriarch.|$|E

40|$|For <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> <b>and</b> {{purposes}} the United States of America in 1927 was an apartheid state. The Plessy v.

The Plessy decision essentially capped a series of Supreme Court decisions which underscored the destruction of Reconstruction {{and the return of}} 2 ̆ 2 states rights 2 ̆ 2 to southern governments.

We'd always been in love with the idea of albums as opposed to just singles - which are cool in their way and suit dance music perfectly but we wanted to stretch ourselves and make a statement with a set of songs.
