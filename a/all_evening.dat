5|$|The {{big game}} starts with six players, {{including}} Howard and the Kid, with Shooter playing as he deals and Lady Fingers relieving him whenever Shooter needs a break. In {{the first big}} confrontation between the Kid and Howard, the Kid is short $2,000 and Slade steps in to stake him. Several hours later, Howard busts a player called Pig, perhaps with a bluff, and the remaining players take a break. Following the break, Lady Fingers, who has been delighting in needling Howard <b>all</b> <b>evening,</b> takes over as dealer and continues to needle him.|$|E

25|$|The {{opening night}} was on Tuesday 13 September 1927 and {{drew in a}} crowd of 35,000 and the racing was {{dampened}} by persistent rain <b>all</b> <b>evening.</b> The opening race was the Chorley Wood Stakes and it was won by Baltard Castle over 500 yards {{in a time of}} 30.80 sec at 3-1 for trainer Sid Jennings. Another greyhound racing that evening was Ever Bright trained by John 'Jack' Kennedy and although only finishing third he would finish as runner-up in the 1927 English Greyhound Derby less than one month later. The original trainers were Kennedy, Jennings, William Spoor, Harry Buck and Reginald Grey. Track lighting was seen as a first time experience by most (football did not have floodlights for another 30 years).|$|E
25|$|Billed {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} teams of all time, the 1990–91 squad became the first team in 12 seasons to go undefeated in the regular season (27–0). A perfect record of 18–0 captured the Big West crown and earned the Rebels the No. 1 seed in the West Region. UNLV also flexed its muscles in a 112–105 victory over then–No. 2 Arkansas in Fayetteville. The Rebels rolled through regional play with wins over Montana, Georgetown, Utah and Seton Hall before a showdown with Duke in the Final Four at the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis. Grant Hill, Bobby Hurley, and Christian Laettner kept the Rebels in check <b>all</b> <b>evening</b> and ended UNLV’s dreams of back–to–back championships and the first perfect season since Indiana in 1976. The 79–77 loss ended UNLV’s season with a record of 34–1. The team was inducted into the UNLV Athletic Hall of Fame in 2002.|$|E
25|$|The cafés {{and bars}} of Montparnasse were {{a meeting place}} where ideas were hatched and mulled over. The cafés at the centre of Montparnasse's night-life were in the Carrefour Vavin, now renamed Place Pablo-Picasso. In Montparnasse's heyday (from 1910 to 1920), the cafés Le Dôme, La Closerie des Lilas, La Rotonde, Le Select, and La Coupoleall of which are still in {{business}} were the places where starving artists could occupy a table <b>all</b> <b>evening</b> for a few centimes. If they fell asleep, the waiters were instructed not to wake them. Arguments were common, some fuelled by intellect, others by alcohol, {{and if there were}} fights, and there often were, the police were never summoned. If you couldn't pay your bill, people such as La Rotonde's proprietor, Victor Libion, would often accept a drawing, holding it until the artist could pay. As such, there were times when the café's walls were littered with a collection of artworks, that today would make the curators of the world's greatest museums drool with envy.|$|E

2500|$|The group's alibi {{of playing}} bridge <b>all</b> <b>evening</b> is ruined when the Inspector notices a playing card {{on the floor}} across the room from the bridge table. A full deck of cards is needed to {{properly}} play bridge. Therefore, the Inspector knows the group {{could not have been}} playing several consecutive hands of bridge that evening. This is similar to an attempted alibi in the short story [...] "King of Clubs," [...] which appears in 'Poirot's Early Cases'. A family claims that they have been playing bridge all night and therefore cannot be involved in a murder that has occurred in their neighbour's house. Poirot sees through this lie after he discovers a card (the King of Clubs) is missing from the pack on the table. This discovery proves the family's alibi of playing bridge was false and they have lied about their whereabouts that evening.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the end of}} the New Edinburghs' playoffs that season, Hitchman {{was signed}} by the Senators in 1923, first {{appearing}} in a victory against the Hamilton Tigers on February 28. [...] His first playoff game for the Senators was tumultuous, a match against the Montreal Canadiens on March 7 in which future teammate Sprague Cleghorn - with whom he had been sparring <b>all</b> <b>evening</b> - crosschecked Hitchman in the face, knocking him out. Cleghorn received a match penalty for the act, which provoked a near-riot from the home crowd and an assault on the referee. While too injured to play in the first Stanley Cup semifinal match against the Vancouver Maroons of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association, he played in the three remaining matches. [...] In the best-of-three finals against the Edmonton Eskimos of the Western Canada Hockey League, Hitchman starred in a decimated Senators' defence, scoring the tying goal which sent the first game into overtime, won by the Senators en route to their tenth Cup victory.|$|E
