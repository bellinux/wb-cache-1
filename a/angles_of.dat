5000|$|The {{critical}} <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> {{attack is}} the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack which produces maximum lift coefficient. This is {{also called the}} [...] "stall <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack". Below the critical <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack, as the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack increases, the coefficient of lift (Cl) increases. Conversely, above the critical <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack, as <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack increases, the air begins to flow less smoothly over the upper surface of the airfoil and begins to separate from the upper surface. On most airfoil shapes, as the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack increases, the upper surface separation point of the flow moves from the trailing edge towards the leading edge. At the critical <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack, upper surface flow is more separated and the airfoil or wing is producing its maximum coefficient <b>of</b> lift. As <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack increases further, the upper surface flow {{becomes more and more}} fully separated and the airfoil/wing produces less coefficient of lift.|$|R

5000|$|When the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> {{attack is}} less than the {{stalling}} angle any increase in <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack causes an increase in lift coefficient that causes the wing to rise.

Conversely any decrease in <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack causes a decrease in lift coefficient which causes the wing to descend. As the wing descends, the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack and lift coefficient increase which tends to restore the wing to its original <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack. For this reason the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack is stable when it {{is less than}} the stalling angle. [...] The aircraft displays damping in roll.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the wing}} is stalled and the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack {{is greater than}} the {{stalling}} angle any increase in <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack causes a decrease in lift coefficient that causes the wing to descend.

Conversely any decrease in <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack causes an increase in lift coefficient that causes the wing to rise. As the wing rises the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack decreases and causes the lift coefficient to increase further towards the maximum lift coefficient. For this reason the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack is unstable when it {{is greater than the}} stalling <b>angle.</b> Any disturbance <b>of</b> the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack on one wing will cause the whole wing to roll spontaneously and continuously.|$|R

5|$|A {{reflection}} {{is said to}} be indexed {{when its}} Miller indices (or, more correctly, its reciprocal lattice vector components) have been identified from the known wavelength and the scattering angle 2θ.

50|$|The <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> repose, or {{critical}} <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> repose, of a {{granular material}} is the steepest <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> descent or dip {{relative to the}} horizontal plane to which a material can be piled without slumping.

The morphology of the material affects the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> repose; smooth, rounded sand grains cannot be piled as steeply as can rough, interlocking sands. The <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> repose can also be affected by additions of solvents; if a small amount of water is able to bridge the gaps between particles, electrostatic attraction of the water to mineral surfaces will increase the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> repose, and related quantities such as the soil strength.|$|R

5|$|A {{sequence}} of movements {{in which a}} horse takes a step with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a horse completes four movements: the swing phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, soundness, care and training of the horse, and terrain and footing. The proportions and length of the bones and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves. The <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|E
