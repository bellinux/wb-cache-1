6000|$|I {{could not}} help {{laughing}} at her demure little answers. [...] "Why!" [...] I exclaimed, [...] "what a worldly little woman! <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis {{a matter}} {{to be thought}} over," [...] he said, moodily. [...] "A ship might be captured, seeing that there are often French freebooting vessels on the coast. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>your</b> orders from Lord Percy?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Downing's {{mind was}} in a whirl. His case was complete. Mike's {{appearance}} in gym shoes, with the explanation {{that he had lost}} a shoe, completed the chain.

60|$|We watched {{each other}} full five minutes without moving an eyelash. Then his first lesson ebbed away. He sidled {{out into the}} path again, came towards me two dainty, halting steps, and stamped prettily with his left fore foot.
