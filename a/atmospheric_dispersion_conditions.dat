As we know the high concentrations of sulphur dioxide and black smokes in the atmosphere have a tight relationship with the industrial emission sources (quantity and location), but also with the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>conditions.</b> So we tried to find the main causes, from a climatological point of view, involved in the occurrence of peaks of pollution registered at Oporto air monitoring network, from 1 April 1987 to 31 March 1989...|$|E

40|$|A {{consideration}} of research needs {{for the development}} of ambient air criteria for energy-based pollutants assumes a requirement for ambient air quality criteria. These may be defined as the observed effects or responses of one or more air pollutants on a specified receptor under any given conditions. Air quality criteria may be used solely as reference materials, but they are usually combined with political, social and economic considerations {{as the basis for the}} establishment of standards or guidelines. The development of standards or guidelines is normally considered the ultimate aim of a program devoted to the development of ambient air quality criteria. If energy-based industries met appropriate emission rates and emissions were released under adequate <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>conditions</b> from stacks which met good engineering standards, would it be necessary to have ambient air quality standards or guidelines for energy-based pollutants...|$|E
40|$|Strategic spatial {{patterning}} of crop {{species and}} cultivars could make agricultural landscapes {{less vulnerable to}} plant disease epidemics, but experimentation to explore effective disease-suppressive landscape designs is problematic. Here, we present a realistic, multiscale, spatiotemporal, integrodifference equation model of potato late blight epidemics to determine the relationship between spatial heterogeneity and disease spread, and determine the effectiveness of mixing resistant and susceptible cultivars at different spatial scales {{under the influence of}} weather. The model framework comprised a landscape generator, a potato late blight model that includes host and pathogen life cycles and fungicide management at the field scale, and an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dispersion</b> model that calculates spore dispersal at the landscape scale. Landscapes consisted of one or two distinct potato-growing regions (6. 4 -by- 6. 4 -km) embedded within a nonhost matrix. The characteristics of fields and growing regions and the separation distance between two growing regions were investigated for their effects on disease incidence, measured as the proportion of fields with = 1 % severity, after inoculation of a single potato grid cell with a low initial level of disease. The most effective spatial strategies for suppressing disease spread in a region were those that reduced the acreage of potato or increased the proportion of a resistant potato cultivar. Clustering potato cultivation in some parts of a region, either by planting in large fields or clustering small fields, enhanced the spread within such a cluster while it delayed spread from one cluster to another; however, the net effect of clustering was an increase in disease at the landscape scale. The planting of mixtures of a resistant and susceptible cultivar was a consistently effective option for creating potato-growing regions that suppressed disease spread. It was more effective to mix susceptible and resistant cultivars within fields than plant some fields entirely with a susceptible cultivar and other fields with a resistant cultivar, at the same ratio of susceptible to resistant potato plants at the landscape level. Separation distances of at least 16 km were needed to completely prevent epidemic spread from one potato-growing region to another. Effects of spatial placement of resistant and susceptible potato cultivars depended strongly on meteorological conditions, indicating that landscape connectivity for the spread of plant disease depends on the particular coincidence between direction of spread, location of fields, distance between the fields, and survival of the spores depending on the weather. Therefore, in the simulation of (airborne) pathogen invasions, {{it is important to consider}} the large variability of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>condition...</b>|$|R

The French community involved in air quality monitoring early got interested in the measurement of submicronic particles. Since 2003 INERIS has carried out monitoring campaigns {{once or twice a}} year in an urban site located near Paris, enabling the constitution of a large hourly database. Besides air quality measurements, other variables have been introduced into the database: traffic and heating emissions provided by the local air quality monitoring agency (AIRPARIF); meteorological variables issued from monitoring or extracted from the meteorological MM 5 model (height of the boundary layer). An exploratory study of the data collected from 2003 to 2007 has been performed.

Moreover back trajectories of air masses and Principal Component Analyses were applied. Three of the peak PM 10 episodes investigated {{were related to}} local emissions of primary pollutants during poor <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>conditions.</b> The other two peak PM 10 episodes considered are related with long range transport air masses toward Apulia region: in one case the chemical characterization and the back trajectories analysis indicate that high PM 10 value detected {{is due to the}} Saharan dust advection in the Apulia region; in the other case air masses with different origin give rise to high PM 10 value. Moreover PM 10 daily mean concentrations, presented in this paper collected from January 2005 to August 2007 and obtained by automatic device in six stations of air quality monitoring networks in Bari territory, do not show a seasonal trend for PM 10 concentrations, contrary to the PM 10 trend shown in the towns of North Italy.

40|$|Purpose This {{study was}} aimed to the {{development}} of an integrated approach for the characterization of particulate matter (PM) pollution events in the South of Italy. Methods PM 10 and PM 2. 5 daily samples were collected from June to November 2008 at an urban background site located in Bari (Puglia Region, South of Italy). Meteorological data, particle size distributions and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>conditions</b> were also monitored in order to provide information concerning the different features of PM sources. Results The collected data allowed suggesting four indicators to characterize different PM 10 exceedances. PM 2. 5 /PM 10 ratio, natural radioactivity, aerosol maps and back-trajectory analysis and particle distributions were considered in order to evaluate the contribution of local anthropogenic sources and to determine the different origins of intrusive air mass coming from long-range transport, such as African dust outbreaks and aerosol particles from Central and Eastern Europe. The obtained results were confirmed by applying principal component analysis to the number particle concentration dataset and by the chemical characterization of the samples (PM 10 and PM 2. 5). Conclusions The integrated approach for PM study suggested in this paper can be useful to support the air quality managers for the development of cost-effective control strategies and the application of more suitable risk management approaches...|$|E
3000|$|Intermittent {{control is}} a {{straightforward}} engineering approach to process control of any type. As a special form of switching control, intermittent {{control is a}}lso divided into two classes: state-dependent switching rule and time-switching rule. The former implies that the control operation is activated only when the states enter the certain region which is often pregiven; while the later activates the control only in some finite time intervals; the system evolves freely when the time goes out of those intervals. Therefore, these intermittent control systems are open-loop. Intermittent control {{has been used for}} a variety of purposes in such engineering fields as manufacturing, transportation, air-quality control, and communication, and so on. In the chaos control context, Carr and Schwartz [22 – 24] demonstrated a method to control unstable steady states in high-dimensional flows using the duration of time for which feedback control was applied as an addition parameter. Starrett [25] proposed the so-called [...] "occasional bang-bang" [...] method to stabilize a periodic saddle point in a strange attractor. The main idea of occasional bang-bang is to apply control only at regular intervals and for fixed durations. An application of intermittent control in air-quality control was reported in [26] where the authors reported a kind of intermittent control system which was designed to achieve ambient air quality standards constantly by varying emission rates in response to changing <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>conditions.</b> Recently, the authors in [27] proposed a scheme to decouple neighboring qubits in quantum computers through bang-bang pulse control and demonstrated that two similar sequence of pulses with different time intervals not only suppress decoherence but entirely or selectively decouple two neighboring qubits. The authors in [27 – 31] suggested to controlling the evolution of a system by using strong, short pulses as a new means for quantum error prevention. Also, the authors in [32] discussed chaotic synchronization by using intermittent control.|$|E

In addition, the sensitivity to the use of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) -derived spatial distributions of vegetation characteristics on <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dispersion</b> is also studied. The impact of vegetation and terrain heterogeneities on <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dispersion</b> is strongly modulated by soil moisture, with the nature of dispersion switching from non-Gaussian to near- Gaussian behaviour for wetter soils (fraction of saturation soil moisture content exceeding 40 %). For drier soil moisture conditions, vegetation heterogeneity produces differential heating and the formation of mesoscale circulation patterns that are primarily responsible for non-Gaussian dispersion patterns. Nighttime dispersion is very sensitive to topographic, vegetation, soil moisture, and soil type heterogeneity and is distinctly non-Gaussian for heterogeneous land-surface conditions.

40|$|In {{the field}} of exoplanetary sciences, high {{contrast}} imaging is crucial for the direct detection of, and answering questions about habitability of exoplanets. For the direct imaging of habitable exoplanets, {{it is important to}} employ low inner working angle (IWA) coronagraphs, which can image exoplanets close to the PSF. To achieve the full performance of such coronagraphs, it is crucial to correct for <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dispersion</b> to the highest degree, as any leakage will limit the contrast. To achieve the highest contrast with the state-of-the-art coronagraphs in the SCExAO instrument, the spread in the point-spread function due to residual <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dispersion</b> should not be more than 1 mas in the science band. In a traditional approach, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dispersion</b> is compensated by an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dispersion</b> compensator (ADC), which is simply based on model which only takes into account the elevation of telescope and hence results in imperfect correction of dispersion. In this paper we present the first on-sky closed-loop measurement and correction of residual <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dispersion.</b> Exploiting the elongated nature of chromatic speckles, we can precisely measure the presence of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>dispersion</b> and by driving the ADC, we can do real-time correction.
