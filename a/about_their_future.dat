Given no other choice, Kolish contacted his only remaining adult relative, a brother who lived in Hollywood, and left instructions for the care of Sarria and his family.|$|E

Leslie reluctantly accepts Ben's invitation to a celebratory dinner that night, where Ben brings up his feelings for Leslie. She slips away to call Ann for advice, and she urges Leslie to act on her feelings. Just as Leslie decides to do so, she is surprised to find Chris has arrived at the dinner to congratulate the two personally.

5|$|Arsenal {{and their}} players {{pleaded guilty to}} the charges against them, but still {{received}} a £175,000 fine, the largest ever given to a club by the FA. Lauren, Martin Keown, Patrick Vieira and Ray Parlour were all suspended for between one and four matches: Lauren received a four-game ban – half of the potential ban he could have received – and a £40,000 fine; Keown was suspended for three matches and had to pay a £20,000 fine; Vieira and Parlour were given one-game bans and had to pay £20,000 and £10,000 respectively. Jens Lehmann was originally charged but this was later dropped. Ashley Cole was not suspended but was given a £10,000 fine. Ryan Giggs and Cristiano Ronaldo both {{pleaded not guilty to}} their involvement in the incident, but after a five-hour hearing in December 2003, Giggs was handed a £7,500 fine and Ronaldo a £4,000 fine and both were warned <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>future</b> conduct.|$|E
5|$|Vizzini {{initially}} {{supported the}} separatist movement in Sicily. On December 6, 1943, Vizzini participated {{at the first}} clandestine regional convention of the Sicilian separatists movement of the Sicilian Independence Movement (Movimento Indipendentista Siciliano - MIS) in Catania. Other prominent Mafia bosses like Giuseppe Genco Russo, Gaetano Filippone, Michele Navarra and Francesco Paolo Bontade did not hide their sympathies for the separatists either. The separatists benefited from covert support of the OSS. As Italy experienced a leftward drift in 1943-1944, the American military became increasingly concerned <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>future</b> prospects in Italy. The island's naval bases and strategic location in the Mediterranean provided a possible future counterbalance to a Communism on the Italian mainland. The Italian Communist Party's membership had doubled and the largely left inspired resistance movement in the north was gathering strength.|$|E

Eventually, Saori and Yoshino rejoin Shuichi's group of friends, though Saori says she still hates Yoshino and Momoko. Shuichi and Anna start dating, much {{to the surprise of}} their friends and Shuichi's sister. Yoshino and Saori manage to halfway repair their friendship, though Saori is still standoffish to others. Shuichi's friends are split up into several classes upon entering their second year in junior high school. Shuichi becomes friends with Shinpei Doi, who previously teased Shuichi about wanting to be a girl. Yoshino attends school in a boy's uniform for a short time, and Shuichi tries to go to school dressed as a girl one day, but is laughed at, and becomes discouraged. Shuichi's friends worry as Shuichi begins skipping school. Although Shuichi eventually starts attending school regularly again, Anna breaks off their relationship. By the time Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter their third year in junior high school, Shuichi's voice is changing.

25|$|Maternal {{sensitivity}} {{in adolescent}} mothers can be predicted prenatally. Mothers who talked lively and positively <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>future</b> {{relationship with the}} child were found to display higher maternal sensitivity {{than those who did}} not (classified as autonomous mothers). Autonomous mothers were also found to have infants with a more secure attachment. Adolescent mothers who were not classified as autonomous were found to have anxiously attached infants. Furthermore, adolescent mothers were found to have children four–eight years old with lower IQs and a below-average reading level, than did adult mothers.|$|E
25|$|Following this, the {{battalion}} was transferred back to Egypt where the AIF underwent {{a period of}} reorganisation as decisions were made <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>future</b> employment.

25|$|In January 2012, {{after much}} speculation, Beckham signed a new two-year deal with LA to secure his {{short-term}} future at the club.

25|$|Fukuzawa {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} people ever that helped Japan modernize into the country it is today. He never accepted any high position and remained a normal Japanese citizen for his whole life. By the time of his death, he was revered as one of the founders of modern Japan. All of his work was written and was released at a critical juncture in the Japanese society and uncertainty for the Japanese people <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>future</b> after the signing of the Unequal treaties, their realization in the weakness of the Japanese government at the time (Tokugawa Shogunate) and its inability to repel the American and European influence. It should also be noted that there were bands of samurai that forcefully opposed the Americans and Europeans and their friends through murder and destruction. Fukuzawa was in danger of his life as a samurai group killed one of his colleagues for advocating policies like those of Fukuzawa. Fukuzawa wrote at a time when the Japanese people were undecided on whether they should be bitter about the American and European forced treaties and imperialism, or to understand the West and move forward. Fukuzawa greatly aided the ultimate success of the pro-modernization forces.|$|E

40|$|Results {{from the}} 2008 Nebraska Rural Poll showed rural Nebraskans were more optimistic <b>about</b> <b>their</b> lives {{than they have}} been in {{previous}} years.

The poll was taken between March and May, 2008, before the national economy began to falter in October. Thus the 2009 Nebraska Rural Poll will help clarify how rural Nebraskans are responding to the current economic times...|$|R
