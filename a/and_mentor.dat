40|$|In {{discussion}} recently, a {{group of}} coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> students at Oxford Brookes University highlighted how studying coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring,</b> using rigorous methods to answer meaningful questions had developed their practice more than they could have ever anticipated. This issue of IJEBCM draws {{particular attention to the}} questions asked by those studying coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> illustrates the benefits to practice of undertaking meaningful and systematic research. The issue includes papers presented at the recent Coaching <b>and</b> <b>Mentoring</b> Research Conference, held at Oxford Brookes University on 7 th April 2006. Since research in the field of coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> is relatively new, this annual conference was instigated specifically to provide an opportunity for postgraduate students from any institution to share their work with a much wider audience. The benefits to coaching practice of well-formed questions are articulated in the summary by P. Alex Linley of his keynote presentation at the conference. In this paper Linley, writing as an academic researcher, talks about the advantages of research for coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> the obstacles to research both for the academic and the practitioner.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2004. The study {{investigated}} the role of induction <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> programmes in achieving school effectiveness. The study did not address all the issues related to school effectiveness. It aimed at finding out if the two schools under study had induction <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> programmes, <b>and</b> if these programmes were effectively used, and also to ascertain if the programmes of induction <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> contributed to the sound relationships within the school community. In order to answer the research questions the study employed a qualitative case study approach. Literature on issues of induction <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> locally <b>and</b> internationally was examined to provide a wider context with which to view the present study. Interviews were conducted which involved a sample of seven educators, employed between the years 2002 and 2003. Observation of the staff meetings {{and three of the}} newly appointed educators teaching was also conducted. Documents supplied by the Department, such as, Towards Effective School Management Manuals, The Final Draft of Systemic Evaluation 2001 KZN, Handbook for the Code of Professional Ethics 2002 and Guides for School Management Teams, related to induction <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> were analysed. The findings of the study suggest that in one school, the educators felt abandoned. In the other, the educators felt at home as regards induction <b>and</b> <b>mentoring.</b> The findings also seem to suggest that the schools studied did not practice formal induction <b>and</b> <b>mentoring.</b> As far as <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> having <b>mentors</b> were concerned, educators in one school, have their H. O. Ds as mentors although it was not spelt out to them. Educators in the other school did not have mentors in the school. The study recommends that principals, especially the beginning principals, need to be given guidance in the development of programmes of induction <b>and</b> <b>mentoring.</b> Workshops would also help to develop principals in using documents supplied to schools by the Department, to ensure the effective implementation of procedures and processes to be followed in schools...|$|R
