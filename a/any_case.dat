5|$|Darwin {{quoted a}} passage from Aristotle's Physics II 8 in The Origin of Species, which entertains the {{possibility}} of a selection process following the random combination of body parts. However, Aristotle immediately rejected the possibility, and he was in <b>any</b> <b>case</b> discussing ontogeny, the Empedoclean coming into being of an individual from component parts, not phylogeny and natural selection.|$|E

In <b>any</b> <b>case,</b> Amenemhat's rule {{seems to have been}} peaceful and uneventful. Amenemhat IV is well attested by contemporary artefacts, including a number of scarab- and cylinder-seals.|$|E
5|$|Internally, the wiping policy officially {{came to an}} end in 1978, {{when the}} means to further exploit {{programmes}} by taking advantage of the new market for home videocassette recordings started to become apparent.

5|$|Others {{are less}} sure: the Olmec-style sculptures may simply imply a common {{iconography}} of {{power on the}} Pacific and Gulf coasts.

5|$|When the National Assembly reconvened in Hanoi on October 28, only 30 of the 50 VNQDD {{seats were}} filled. Of the 37 VNQDD and Dong Minh Hoi members who turned up, only 20 {{remained}} {{by the end}} of the session. By the end of the year, Tam had resigned as foreign minister and fled to China, and only one of the three original VNQDD cabinet members was still in office. In <b>any</b> <b>case,</b> the VNQDD never had any power, despite their numerical presence. Upon the opening of the National Assembly, the communist majority voted to vest power in an executive committee almost entirely consisting of communists; the legislature met only once a year. In <b>any</b> <b>case,</b> the façade of a legislature was dispensed with as the First Indochina War went into full flight. A small group of VNQDD fighters escaped Giáp's assault and retreated to a mountainous enclave along the Sino-Vietnamese border, where they declared themselves to be the government of Vietnam, with little effect.|$|E

These non-standard design pillboxes may be produced in some numbers or completely ad hoc designs suited to local conditions. Other designs were produced as commercial ventures.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a further}} tiny energy gain could be {{extracted}} by synthesizing 62Ni, {{which has a}} marginally higher binding energy than 56Fe, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process. Element production in supernovas and distribution on Earth greatly favor iron over nickel, and in <b>any</b> <b>case,</b> 56Fe still has a lower mass per nucleon than 62Ni due to its higher fraction of lighter protons. Hence, elements heavier than iron require a supernova for their formation, involving rapid neutron capture by starting 56Fe nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{is silent}} about archers on the Alamanni side. The Germans almost {{certainly}} did not have mounted archers, as this was an arm that evolved in the East and in <b>any</b> <b>case,</b> their longbows are unsuitable for use on horseback. As for the infantry, the archery capability of the Rhine Germans has traditionally been seen as negligible, due to the 6th-century writer Agathias's comment that the Franks {{did not know how}} to use bows. But this is contradicted by the archaeological record and by Ammianus himself in other parts of his account. It is virtually certain that there were a significant number of Alamanni foot archers at Strasbourg.|$|E

25|$|Noahide law differs radically from Roman law for gentiles (Jus Gentium), if {{only because}} the latter was {{enforceable}} judicial policy.

50|$|A reserve {{judge is}} {{distinguished}} from a commissioner in that a reserve judge is meant for intermittent, temporary work only, {{not as a}} permanent solution.

5|$|Ancient sources present {{disparate}} casualty {{figures for}} the Battle of Issus. Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus approximate 100,000 Persian deaths, {{in contrast with the}} 450 Macedonian deaths reported by Quintus Curtius Rufus. In <b>any</b> <b>case,</b> it is probable that more Persians were killed as they fled than in battle; Ptolemy I, who served with Alexander during the battle, recounts how the Macedonians crossed a ravine on the bodies of their enemies during the pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Another very ancient seat is the {{so-called}} “Chair of Dagobert” in the Louvre. It is of cast bronze, sharpened with the chisel and partially gilt; it is of the curule or faldstool type and supported upon legs terminating in the heads and feet of animals. The seat, which was probably of leather, has disappeared. Its attribution depends entirely upon the statement of Suger, abbot of St Denis in the 12th century, who added a back and arms. Its age has been much discussed, but Viollet-le-Duc dated it to early Merovingian times, and it may in <b>any</b> <b>case</b> be taken as the oldest faldstool in existence.|$|E
5|$|Astatine is an {{extremely}} radioactive element; all its isotopes have short half-lives of 8.1 hours or less, decaying into other astatine isotopes, bismuth, polonium or radon. Most of its isotopes are very unstable with half-lives of one second or less. Of the first 101 elements in the periodic table, only francium is less stable, and all the astatine isotopes more stable than francium are in <b>any</b> <b>case</b> synthetic and do not occur in nature.|$|E
