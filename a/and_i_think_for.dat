500|$|Avnet and Conran {{spent two}} years working on the screenplay, which {{included}} numerous genre-related references and homages, and developing a working relationship. Then, the producer took the script and the trailer and began approaching actors. In order to protect Conran's vision, Avnet decided to shoot the movie independently {{with a lot of}} his own money. The producer realized that [...] "the very thing that made this film potentially so exciting for me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> an audience, which was the personal nature of it and the singularity of the vision, would never succeed and never survive the development process within a studio." ...|$|E
500|$|Co-creator J. J. Abrams' {{inspiration}} for Fringe {{came from a}} range of sources, including the writings of Michael Crichton, the Ken Russell film Altered States, and the television series The X-Files and The Twilight Zone. The specific story for Fringe was developed during long conversations between series creators Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. The team was discussing several different options, and the idea behind Fringe appealed to them most because it contained a long-term story and characters' backstories which were not [...] "evident but alluded to in the pilot". The team {{spent a lot of time}} thinking about the [...] "trifecta of characters" [...] that they needed to have in the series, and why there were uniquely interesting. The creators decided on the idea of a father-son story because it was compelling and accessible, [...] "you don't necessarily have to know anything about science, because everyone has a parent and everyone has issues with a parent. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> us it's always about coming into it through character". Orci stated that the series is a combination of a procedural and an [...] "extremely serialized and very culty" [...] series, quoting as examples of each, Law & Order and Lost.|$|E
500|$|Pamela's {{marriage}} to Bobby Ewing {{is central to}} understanding her character. The couple produced the opening scene of Dallas when the show first aired in 1978, with Bobby bringing his new bride home to meet Jock and Miss Ellie Ewing. [...] Their complex relationship has often been {{compared to that of}} Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. When asked about whether or not series creator David Jacobs had this parallel relationship in mind from the start, he said: [...] "Yes, guilty (laughs)". Relations can be made from William Shakespeare's two feuding families in Romeo and Juliet, the Montagues and the Capulets. These families represent the Barnes and the Ewing feuding families, with Pamela being portrayed as Juliet Capulet and Bobby as Romeo Montague. According to Patrick Duffy, being immediately paired off with Principal was a challenge. He said, [...] "We were {{in a constant state of}} competition. We were very territorial in front of the camera, and it was a strain." [...] However, their off-screen relationship significantly improved in the show's third season, with Duffy explaining: [...] "I developed an appreciation for her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> the first time she started to trust me. Some of the best scenes on the show were between Victoria and me, and they happened after we got comfortable with each other." ...|$|E

500|$|Mylod {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} filming the final {{scenes of the}} episode, the foot chase between Arya and the Waif, in the behind the scenes featurette published by HBO after the airing of the episode. Mylod stated that he did extensive research {{in order to create}} the foot chase, saying [...] "I devoured every foot chase in the history of cinema, but trying to take from that something that would fit into the blueprint of the Game of Thrones visual style, which is not necessarily the same kind of kinetic, handheld feel that you find in many contemporary thrillers. It's a much more classic frame." [...] He continued, [...] "Everything hinged from finding this very lovely, steep stairwell and thinking 'Wouldn't it be great if she leapt off that, and then tumbled down the stairs?' I had this image in my head that I wanted lots of oranges rolling down, not quite sure where that comes from, but it looked pretty." [...] Mylod also stated in a separate interview that it was a conscious decision not to show the final fight between Arya and the Waif, given that it took place in the dark, noting [...] "when the character dies in the dark, unless we switch on night-vision goggles, we're {{not going to be able}} to see that, and we're not going to stick around to hear a scream in the dark anyway. It was actually a conscious choice in the writing <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>for</b> me, a very elegant storytelling beat as to get that reveal a few seconds later." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because {{the films}} {{were being made}} as the novels were being published, the filmmakers {{had no idea of}} the story's outcome until the release of the final novel in 2007. Kloves spoke of his {{relationship}} with Rowling when adapting the novels by saying, [...] "The thing is about Jo, which is remarkable for someone who had no experience with the filmmaking process, was her intuition. We had a conversation the very first day I met her where she said, 'I know the movies can't be the books... because I know what's coming and it's impossible to fully dramatise on screen what I'm going to write. But I just ask you to be true to the characters; that's all I care about.'" [...] Kloves also said, [...] "I don't know what compelled me to say this , but I said, 'I've just got to warn you my favourite character is not Harry. My favourite character is Hermione.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> some weird reason, from that moment on, she sort of trusted me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Philosopher Steven Best {{and trauma}} surgeon Jerry Vlasak, {{both of whom}} have volunteered for the North American press office, were banned from {{entering}} the UK in 2004 and 2005 after making statements that appeared to support violence against people. Vlasak told an animal rights conferences in 2003: [...] "I don't think you'd have to kill—assassinate—too many vivisectors before you would see a marked decrease {{in the amount of}} vivisection going on. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> five lives, 10 lives, 15 human lives, we could save a million, two million, 10 million non-human animals." [...] Best coined the term [...] "extensional self-defence" [...] to describe actions carried out in defense of animals by human beings acting as proxies. He argues that activists have the moral right to engage in acts of sabotage or even violence because animals are unable to fight back themselves. Best argues that the principle of extensional self-defense mirrors the penal code statues known as the necessity defense, which can be invoked when a defendant believes the illegal act was necessary to avoid imminent and great harm.|$|E

That it was in dread of you that Her Highness spoke, I do deny; for I cannot think she has any such feelings toward you. She was full of maternal affection for me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>for</b> I will conceal naught that I truly believe, that apprehension of thy powers to please, Luis, may have induced her to apprehend that an orphan girl, like myself, might possibly consult her fancy more than her prudence, and wed one who seemed to love the uttermost limits of the earth {{so much better than}} his own noble castles and his proper home." ...|$|E

In entering dock, carried away starboard cathead and started starboard chain plates; held survey of damage done: decided to take off channel bends, renew through bolts, straighten plates and replace same; also to renew cathead and caulk ship’s side in wake of plate, six seams, &c. &c. There, now, that looks better. Twenty-seven pounds eighteen and seven-pence halfpenny, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>for</b> all that damage, it’s a very reasonable bill.

6000|$|The Rev. Mr. Boms now {{rose to his}} feet. [...] "If I may {{venture to}} express myself," [...] he said, [...] "I should say that the fact of the--er--deceased having {{committed}} suicide should weigh very heavily--very heavily with our worthy chairman. I have no doubt it has weighed with him, for--I say this for myself <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> everyone present (hear, hear)--he enjoys our confidence in a high degree. We all desire, I should hope, to be charitable. But I feel sure" [...] (he-looked severely at the late superintendent's brother-in-law) [...] "that he will in some way, by some written expression, or better perhaps by reducing the amount, record our grave disapproval that so promising and valuable a life should have been thus impiously removed from a sphere where both its own interests and--if I may say so--our interests so imperatively demanded its continuance. We should not--nay, we may not--countenance so grave a dereliction of all duty, both human and divine." ...|$|E
6000|$|At a {{conversation}} {{in the library of}} 13 Carlton House Terrace, it [...] was considered whether Hawarden should be sold. Every obvious [...] argument was in favour of it, for example the comparison between [...] the income and the liabilities I have named. How was Lady Glynne's [...] jointure (£2500) to be paid? How was Sir Stephen to be supported? [...] There was no income, even less than none. Oak Farm, the iron [...] property, was under lease to an insolvent company, and could not be [...] relied on. Your grandfather, who had in some degree surveyed the [...] state of affairs, thought the case was hopeless. But the family [...] were unanimously set upon making any and every effort and sacrifice [...] to avoid the necessity of sale. Mr. Barker, their lawyer, and Mr. [...] Burnett, the land agent, entirely sympathised; and it was resolved [...] to persevere. But the first effect was that Sir Stephen had to [...] close the house (which it was hoped, but hoped in vain, to let); to [...] give up carriages, horses, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> several years his [...] personal servant; and to take an allowance of £700 a year out of [...] which, I believe, he continued to pay the heavy subvention of the [...] family to the schools of the parish, which was certainly counted by [...] hundreds. Had the estate been sold, it was estimated that he would [...] have come out a wealthy bachelor, possessed of from a hundred to a [...] hundred and twenty thousands pounds free from all encumbrance but [...] the jointure.|$|E
