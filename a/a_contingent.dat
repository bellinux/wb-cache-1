5|$|Despite his {{popularity}} {{with the people}} of the Arab world, by mid-1957 his only regional ally was Syria. In September, Turkish troops massed along the Syrian border, giving credence to rumors that the Baghdad Pact countries were attempting to topple Syria's leftist government.

Diefenbaker related in his memoirs that {{he was hit by}} a shovel, and the injury eventually resulted in his being invalided home. Diefenbaker's recollections do not correspond with his army medical records, which show no contemporary account of such an injury, and his biographer, Denis Smith, speculates that any injury was psychosomatic.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War in December 1941, the school's Wirraways were classified as Second Line (Reserve) aircraft in the defence of Australia, while the base was fortified with sandbags, trenches, and gun pits. On 1January 1942, No.60 Squadron was established at Forest Hill from No.2 SFTS aircraft and personnel. Equipped with 18 Wirraways, the unit formed part of the expansion of the Australian military in response to the rapid Japanese advance in the first month of the Pacific War. <b>A</b> <b>contingent</b> of 68 WAAAFs also began arriving at Forest Hill in January.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} We Five, and Bivens in particular, did not {{fulfill their}} potential during their rather short career. They were managed by Frank Werber, {{and the production}} of their recordings was handled by Werber's own company, Trident, rather than by A&M Records. In a 2002 Jerry Burgan attributed the band's collapse in part to the band's management, reflecting that [...] "the dissolution was rooted in unfocused management that permitted a very young group to have too much autonomy. We factionalized into <b>a</b> blues <b>contingent,</b> <b>a</b> pop <b>contingent,</b> and <b>an</b> 'I'm out of here' contingent." ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{modify the}} arbitrage-free {{interval}} of prices for <b>a</b> non-marketed <b>contingent</b> claim in the finite event-tree model of financial markets, {{according to the}} perfect hedging approach being well-known for the two-period model. We prove the existence of solution to the corresponding seller's and buyer's price problem for such a claim under no-arbitrage prices for the marketed contracts and we show {{that each of these}} problems can be solved by decomposing it into a finite number of one-period linear programming problems solved backwards. Finally, we indicate that the set of the no-arbitrage prices for <b>a</b> non-marketed <b>contingent</b> claim is the interval of the real numbers whose supremum and infimum is the seller's and the buyer's price of the claim, respectively. The determination of the set of no-arbitrage prices for <b>a</b> non-marketed <b>contingent</b> claim is related to the utility pricing of such <b>a</b> claim. <b>contingent</b> claims; seller price; buyer price; contingent claim pricing; no-arbitrage pricing; non-marketed claims; multi-period markets; finite event-tree modelling; financial markets; hedging. ...|$|R
5|$|Foskett {{continued}} to undertake sorties with No.80 Squadron until late March 1943, when his operational tour {{came to an}} end. Promoted to acting squadron leader, he was posted as a staff officer to the headquarters of No.209 Group, located in Haifa, Palestine, on 25 May. Foskett's service with the headquarters lasted until 6 October, when he was appointed as commander of No.94 Squadron RAF.

5|$|In September 1281 the Mongols returned, with 50,000 {{of their}} own troops, plus 30,000 others {{including}} Armenians under Leo III, Georgians, and 200 Knights Hospitaller from Marqab, who sent <b>a</b> <b>contingent</b> even though the Franks of Acre had agreed a truce with the Mamluks. The Mongols and their auxiliary troops fought against the Mamluks at the Second Battle of Homs on October 30, 1281, but the encounter was indecisive, with the Sultan suffering heavy losses. In retaliation, Qalawun later besieged and captured the Hospitaller fortress of Marqab in 1285.|$|E
5|$|In {{the naval}} Battle of Thurii, Tarentum appealed for {{military}} aid to Pyrrhus, ruler of Epirus.
