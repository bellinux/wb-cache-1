500|$|In 2000, Dunst {{starred in}} the comedy Bring It On as Torrance Shipman, the captain of a cheerleading squad. The film {{generated}} mostly positive reviews, with many critics reserving praise for her performance. In his review, A. O. Scott called her [...] "a terrific comic actress, largely because of her great expressive range, and the nimbleness with which she can shift from anxiety to aggression to genuine hurt." [...] Charles Taylor of Salon noted that [...] "among contemporary teenage actresses, Dunst has become the sunniest imaginable parodist", even though he thought the film had failed to provide her with as good a role as she had either in Dick or in The Virgin Suicides. Jessica Winter from The Village Voice complimented Dunst, stating that her performance was [...] "as sprightly and knowingly daft as her turn in Dick" [...] and commenting that [...] " [...] provides the only major element of Bring It On that plays as tweaking parody rather than slick, strident, body-slam churlishness." [...] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle, despite giving the film an unfavorable review, commended Dunst for her willingness [...] "to be as silly and cloyingly agreeable <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> get through a slapdash film." ...|$|E

A person who said, [...] "I intend to be a nazirite for 30 days plus an hour," [...] became a nazirite for 31 days, as there was no naziriteship for a period of hours.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the 2011 Assembly election concerns were raised by politicians and others about {{the time it took}} for ballots to be verified and counted. The first result came in at 7:00p.m. on Friday 6 May, nine hours after counting began and 21 hours after polls closed. The announcement of the final results for some constituencies came two days after the polls closed. In contrast, the first result for elections held in Scotland on the same day as the Assembly election came in at 12:54a.m., just under three hours after counting began, and the final result came in at 5:21p.m. on the same day (Friday 6 May). [...] In response to the criticisms about the speed of counting, Northern Ireland's Chief Electoral Officer, Graham Shields, defended the process, saying that it was [...] "about accuracy, not about speed", adding that [...] "This is a complicated process and people have to accept that. We will take as long <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> get it right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shakespeare's sonnet cycle has {{overarching}} {{themes of}} great {{love and the}} passage of time. In this sonnet, the speaker is now concentrating on his own death and how the youth is to mourn him after he is deceased. The speaker tells the youth not to mourn {{for him when he}} is dead, and that the youth should only think about him for as long <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> tell the world of his death. The speaker then tells his beloved youth that if even reading this sonnet will cause him to suffer, he should forget the hand that wrote the poem. Joseph Pequigney writes that the sonnet is a [...] "persuasive appeal to be recalled, loved and lamented…a covert counterthesis". Stephen Booth calls this sonnet [...] "a cosmic caricature of a revenging lover." [...] While many critics agree with Peguiney and Booth, and have said that this sonnet is a veiled attempt {{on the part of the}} speaker to actually invoke the youth to mourn him, some critics believe differently. Helen Vendler writes that [...] "There are also, I believe, sonnets of hapless love--intended as such by the author, expressed as such by the speaker." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} published 3 August 2012, Fripp {{stated that he}} had retired from working as a professional musician, citing long-standing differences with Universal Music Group and stating that working within the music industry had become [...] "a joyless exercise in futility".

2500|$|According to a 2012 investigative {{piece by}} the Somalia Report, the OBP paper {{and other similar}} reports that attempt to {{calibrate}} the global cost of piracy produce inaccurate estimates based {{on a variety of}} factors. Most saliently, instead of comparing the actual costs of piracy with the considerable benefits derived from the phenomenon by the maritime industry and local parties capitalizing on capacity-building initiatives, the OBP paper conflated the alleged piracy costs with the large premiums made by insurance companies and lumped them together with governmental and societal costs. The report also exaggerated the impact that piracy has had on the shipping sector, an industry which has grown steadily in size from 25,000 billion tonnes/miles to 35,000 billion tonnes/miles since the rise of Indian Ocean piracy in 2005. Moreover, the global costs of piracy reportedly represent a small fraction of total maritime shipping expenses and are significantly lower than more routine costs, such as those brought on by port theft, bad weather conditions or fuel-related issues. In the United States alone, the National Cargo Security Council estimated that between $10–$15 billion were stolen from ports in 2003, a figure several times higher than the projected global cost of piracy. Additionally, while the OBP paper alleged that pirate activity has had a significantly negative impact on regional economies, particularly the Kenyan tourism industry, tourist-derived revenue in Kenya rose by 32% in 2011. According to the Somalia Report investigation, the OBP paper also did not factor into its calculations the overall decline in successful pirate attacks beginning {{in the second half of}} 2011, a downward trend largely brought about by the increasing use of armed guards. According to Admiral Terence E. McKnight, ransom demands and payments have risen exponentially and the financers and pirates decided they are willing to wait as long <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> receive [...] "high seven-figure payouts".|$|E
2500|$|Coonan's casting as Carl was {{announced}} on 6 May 2013, {{when it was}} revealed that the character is Kirsty Branning's (Kierston Wareing) ex-boyfriend and has been in prison, where he had shared a cell with Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Coonan said of his casting, [...] "EastEnders {{has been a part of}} my life since I was 12 years old. I even remember talking about the storylines in school playgrounds in Tottenham and I am very happy and proud to now be a small part of its life." [...] Executive producer Lorraine Newman said: [...] "It's wonderful to have Daniel Coonan joining us in Walford to play Carl White. Oozing confidence and with a dangerous edge, will Kirsty be able to resist his bad boy charms for long, or can [...] Max [...] save her from the lure of the dark side?" [...] This is Coonan's second role in EastEnders, as he played David Priors in 2011. Coonan said the four-episode role helped him prepare for a bigger role in the programme, though describing his first day on set as Carl, he said, [...] "it still hits you when you walk on to the Square for the very first time. It's like walking into your TV." [...] Coonan filmed his first scene on the Bridge Street market set. Heat reported that Carl's introduction was part of a [...] "rescue plan" [...] to increase ratings for EastEnders, especially with the announced departures of popular characters Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner), Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), saying [...] "with ever-dwindling ratings and an unusually bare trophy cabinet, producers have been forced to plan some major shake-ups in an attempt to revive the ailing drama with new characters, returning familiar faces and exciting storylines." [...] Coonan later said of being cast, [...] "When they offered the part of Carl to me, I thought about it as long <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> blink your eyelids. I knew it would be a great character and fun to play. Something like this can massively raise your profile. I'm beaming into thousands of people's homes four times a week." [...] Coonan was originally contracted to appear in 28 episodes over a six-month period, but instead filmed over 60 episodes. After Danny Dyer was cast as Mick Carter in the show, he revealed that he was approached to play Carl.|$|E

5000|$|... 24s {{real time}} story-telling method and split-screen {{technique}} have also received widespread praise and critical acclaim.

60|$|It {{naturally}} {{occurred to}} him on very little reflection, that {{the first step to}} take would be to communicate with one of the Mr Garlands instantly. It was very possible that Mr Abel had not yet left the office.

Armed with these slender powers, she hurried away, commissioned to bring either old Mr Garland or Mr Abel, bodily, to that apartment.|$|E
