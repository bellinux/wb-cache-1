50|$|EEX offers also a {{spot market}} for EU allowances. Since 2005, EEX {{operates}} both spot and derivatives markets in emission allowances. EEX has offered trading of emission allowances {{on the basis}} of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) since 2005. EEX currently runs a secondary market for continuous trading on a Spot and Derivatives basis for EU ETS allowances (EUA, EUAA) and Kyoto credits (CER, ERU). As of March 26, 2008, it is possible to trade CER Futures on the EEX (Certified Emission Reductions), global emission credits in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol. On 14 April 2008 EEX and Eurex launched trading of options on EUA Futures. Since January 2010 EEX AG runs the auctioning of the Emission Allowances issued by the Federal Ministry of the Environment. All trading participants admitted to trading in emission allowances on EEX are able to take part in the auction without any further preconditions regarding licensing. From the very beginning, this also included all trading participants taking part in the existing Eurex cooperation on the Derivatives Market. In addition, EEX also carries out the EUA auctions for further countries (Poland, Hungary). The European Energy Exchange (EEX) has won the tendering procedure for the transitory auctioning platform for the EUA auctioned off by Germany for the third emissions trading period in February 2012 and it was chosen as cooperation exchange for the NER30 program of the European Investment Bank (EIB). As of 30 April 2012, emission allowances for the aviation industry (EU <b>Aviation</b> <b>Allowances</b> - EUAA) will also be offered for trading. Furthermore, Futures on Emission Reduction Units (ERU) will be launched at the end of April. In March, EEX extended the futures on Certified Emission Reductions (CER) for all maturities of the third trading period.|$|E
40|$|Part Three. Mobility in a {{low-carbon}} societyAs of January 2012 aviation will {{be included}} in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. In a Directive adopted in 2008, the European Commission decided to make all flights to or from airports located in any of the 27 EU Member States subject to the scheme. Aviation will thus join the emerging global carbon economy. The sector accounted for some 4 % of total carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion in the EU in 2008, and 13 % of CO 2 emissions from all transport sources, but its emissions could increase by an average 2. 5 % a year in the medium term due to strong growth trends in air traffic. The aviation sector has identified several ways of decoupling its emissions from traffic growth, ranging from improved fuel use efficiency to the development of sustainable alternative jet fuels. Its inclusion in an emissions trading scheme is likely to further stimulate its emissions reduction efforts. This chapter highlights the main facts, figures and trends related to aviation greenhouse gas emissions. It then describes the principles for the inclusion of aviation in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and assesses emissions projections and anticipated demand for <b>aviation</b> <b>allowances</b> up to 2020. Finally, it reviews the range of existing and future options for reducing CO 2 emissions in the aviation sector based on three main levies: an active air transport demand management policy, an increased efficiency of fuel use through technology, operations, or infrastructure improvements, and a lower carbon content of jet fuels...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis provides decision makers {{with a model}} to analyze the impact of an <b>Aviation</b> Consolidated <b>Allowance</b> List (AVCAL) reduction onboard aircraft carriers (CVs). The Department of Defense in currently down-sizing its forces by 25 percent from FY 1991 to FY 1995 due to the reduction in funding caused by the {{significant change in the}} threat assessment. The implications of the current down-sizing of forces are wide-ranging throughout DoD, including the possibility of reducing a CV's AVCAL from 90 to 60 days. Both analytical and simulation models (RP-FOR and RP-SIM, respectively) have been developed. The model measure the impact of reducing an AVCAL from 90 to 60 days by comparing the benefits of savings gained from a reduction of AVCAL, versus the penalties of reduced operational availability of the aircraft.

Returning to Pearl Harbor on 23 November 1944, Bering Strait underwent a shipyard availability and then loaded the equipment of Rescue Squadron 3 (VH-3), which had been substituted for VH-2.|$|R
