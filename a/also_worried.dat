5|$|Like Compton, many U.S. {{officials}} and scientists {{argued that a}} demonstration would sacrifice the shock value of the atomic attack, and the Japanese could deny the atomic bomb was lethal, making the mission less likely to produce surrender. Allied prisoners of war might be moved to the demonstration site and be killed by the bomb. They <b>also</b> <b>worried</b> that the bomb might be a dud since the Trinity test was of a stationary device, not an air-dropped bomb. In addition, only two bombs would be available {{at the start of}} August, although more were in production, and they cost billions of dollars, so using one for a demonstration would be expensive.|$|E
5|$|As the Cold War {{developed}} and the Guatemalan government clashed with U.S. corporations on {{an increasing number}} of issues, the U.S. government grew increasingly suspicious of the Guatemalan Revolution. In addition, the Cold War predisposed the Truman administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist. Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion <b>also</b> <b>worried</b> the Truman administration, which saw it as a vehicle for communism, rather than as the anti-dictatorial force it was conceived as. Until the end of its term, the Truman administration had relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the perceived communist influence. The U.S. had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block all weapons purchases by Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} between Lehto and Lamy {{caused the}} safety car to be deployed, {{with all the}} remaining competitors holding position behind it while travelling at a reduced speed. During this period, {{as a result of}} travelling at slower speeds, tyre temperatures dropped. At the drivers' briefing before the race, Senna, along with Gerhard Berger, had expressed concern that the safety car (itself only reintroduced in Formula One in 1993 and only the third time used since then, the other occurrences being the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix and the 1993 British Grand Prix) did not go fast enough to keep tyre temperatures high. Senna was <b>also</b> <b>worried</b> by a procedure introduced at the 1994 Pacific Grand Prix, whereby the safety car would lead the grid on the formation lap, rather than letting the race leader choose the pace of the formation lap. The procedure was removed for this race.|$|E

3000|$|... 19 We <b>also</b> <b>worry</b> {{more about}} the {{possible}} non-representativeness of the Enterprise Surveys in the non-manufacturing sectors than for the manufacturing sectors. Moreover, in most countries, the Enterprise Surveys do not cover so exhaustively the non-manufacturing sectors.|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} {{stated purpose}} of GRCs was {{to guarantee a}} minimum representation of minorities in Parliament and ensure that {{there would always be}} a multiracial Parliament instead of one made up of a single race. Speaking in Parliament during the debate on whether GRCs should be introduced, First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Goh Chok Tong said he had first discussed the necessity of ensuring the multiracial nature of Parliament with Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in July 1982. Then, Lee had expressed concern about the voting patterns of younger Singaporeans, who appeared to be apathetic to the need of having a racially balanced slate of candidates. He was <b>also</b> <b>worried</b> about more Singaporeans voting along racial lines, which would lead to a lack of minority representation in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|With the {{increasing}} Soviet resistance, a plan {{was made to}} concentrate on only one target. It was decided to halt the Ukhta-offensive and instead support the advance east of Kestenga in mid-August. This new drive {{was able to make}} some ground in the arctic no-man's land, but no decisive breakthrough could be achieved. The increasing Soviet activity <b>also</b> <b>worried</b> Siilasvuo, especially as Group F was now standing still in exposed terrain, open to a possible Soviet encirclement. To counter this, AOK Norwegen decided to bolster the Finnish forces for a final push to the east {{and the rest of the}} SS Nord division was moved south and put under Finnish command. Also parts of 6th Finnish Division were now moved south and returned to the Finnish III Corps for more reinforcements. Once the reorganisation had been completed, a new, final attack had to be launched by both Finnish battlegroups in October.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August 1939, in {{preparation}} for Fall Weiss (Case White)—the German invasion of Poland—Manstein was appointed Chief of Staff to Gerd von Rundstedt's Army Group South. Here he worked along with Rundstedt's Chief of Operations, Colonel Günther Blumentritt, to develop the operational plan. Rundstedt accepted Manstein's plan calling for the concentration {{of the majority of}} the army group's armoured units into Walther von Reichenau's 10th Army, with the objective of a decisive breakthrough which would lead to the encirclement of Polish forces west of the River Vistula. In Manstein's plan, two other armies comprising Army Group South, Wilhelm List's 14th Army and Johannes Blaskowitz's 8th Army, would provide flank support for Reichenau's armoured thrust towards Warsaw, the Polish capital. Privately, Manstein was lukewarm about the Polish campaign, thinking that it would be better to keep Poland as a buffer between Germany and the Soviet Union. He <b>also</b> <b>worried</b> about an Allied attack from the west once the Polish campaign was underway, which would draw Germany into a two-front war.|$|E
25|$|Some {{researchers}} <b>also</b> <b>worry</b> that forgiveness interventions {{will promote}} unhealthy relationships. They worry {{that individuals with}} toxic relationships will continue to forgive those who continuously commit wrong acts towards them {{when in fact they}} should be distancing themselves from these sorts of people.|$|R

5|$|Potemkin was embalmed and {{a funeral}} {{was held for}} him in Jassy. Eight days after his death, he was buried. Catherine was distraught and ordered social life in St. Petersburg be put on hold. Derzhavin's ode Waterfall lamented his death; {{likewise}} many in the military establishment had looked upon Potemkin as a father figure and were especially saddened by his death. Polish contemporary Stanisław Małachowski claimed that Aleksandra von Engelhardt, a niece of Potemkin and wife to Franciszek Ksawery Branicki, a magnate and prominent leader of the Targowica Confederation, <b>also</b> <b>worried</b> for the fate of Poland {{after the death of}} the man who had planned to revitalise the Polish state with him as its new head. Potemkin had used the state treasury as a personal bank, preventing the resolution of his financial affairs to this day. Catherine purchased the Tauride Palace and his art collection from his estate, and paid off his debts. Consequently, he left a relative fortune. Catherine's son Paul, who succeeded to the throne in 1796, attempted to undo as many of Potemkin's reforms as possible. The Tauride Palace was turned into a barracks, and the city of Gregoripol, which had been named in Potemkin's honor, was renamed.|$|E
5|$|Scully finds a {{disassembled}} {{utility knife}} {{at the latest}} crime scene with Mulder's prints on it and discovers that the murder weapon is missing from the evidence room. She meets with Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who is <b>also</b> <b>worried</b> about Mulder's behavior. Mulder has a nightmare about being attacked by a gargoyle that is really himself. He wakes up and goes to Mostow's studio again, finding a severed arm. Scully gets a message to call Nemhauser, but his phone is answered by Mulder, who denies taking the knife. Mulder searches Mostow's studio and finds Nemhauser's body inside a new sculpture. Mulder is then confronted by Patterson, who is unaware of how {{he arrived at the}} studio. Mulder then deduces that Patterson is the killer, based on his three-year obsession with Mostow and his request for Mulder to investigate the case. Mulder confronts him, but Patterson flees when Scully arrives. Mulder pursues him and they fight; Patterson is shot and apprehended.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the lobbying of the United Fruit Company, several other factors also led the United States to launch the coup that toppled Árbenz in 1954. During {{the years of the}} Guatemalan Revolution, military coups occurred in several other Central American countries that brought firmly anti-communist governments to power. Army officer Major Oscar Osorio won staged elections in El Salvador in 1950, Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista took power in 1952. Honduras, where the land-holdings of the United Fruit Company were the most extensive, had been ruled by an anti-communist government sympathetic to the United States since 1932. These developments created tension between the other governments and Árbenz, which was exacerbated by Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion. This support <b>also</b> <b>worried</b> the United States and the newly formed Central Intelligence Agency. According to US historian Richard Immerman, during the beginning of the Cold War, the US and the CIA tended to assume that everybody who opposed it was a communist. Thus, despite Arévalo's ban of the communist party, important figures in the US government were already predisposed to believe that the revolutionary government had been infiltrated by communists, and was a danger to the US. During the years of the revolution, several reports and memoranda were circulated amongst US government agencies that furthered this belief.|$|E

50|$|Critics <b>also</b> <b>worry</b> {{that the}} {{existence}} of lower-yield nuclear weapons for relatively limited tactical purposes will lower the threshold for their actual use, thus blurring the sharp line between conventional weapons intended for use and weapons of mass destruction intended only for hypothetical deterrence, and increasing the risk of escalation to higher-yield nuclear weapons.|$|R
5|$|The {{mission was}} {{reported}} as ready to go—"except for the weather"—on October 1. The major {{concern with the}} weather was a major tropical storm in the Atlantic, though there were <b>also</b> <b>worries</b> over a series of typhoons in the Pacific which could pose a problem for recovery operations. On the evening of October 2, the decision was taken to launch the next morning.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, Truman {{had changed}} his views on the recommendations. The White House staff had {{analyzed}} the WSB's report {{and concluded that the}} wage and benefit package did not violate stabilization guidelines. Truman's political advisors <b>also</b> <b>worried</b> that by repudiating the agency's recommendations, Truman was essentially repudiating his own economic policy.|$|E
25|$|Sun Quan {{considered}} that Cao Cao {{was still a}} threat in the north, so {{he thought it would}} be better for him to have more allies instead of creating hostility between him and Liu Bei. Besides, he was <b>also</b> <b>worried</b> that Liu Bei's men might not submit to him, so he rejected Zhou Yu's idea.|$|E
25|$|Even as {{the company}} {{continued}} to grow worldwide, investors and media became increasingly alarmed about the company's ability to compete with devices from rival mobile operating systems iOS and Android.

25|$|The {{choice of}} {{candidates}} for the position {{was one of the}} most controversial issues faced by the revolutionaries. The Congress refused to consider any candidate from the Dutch ruling house of Orange-Nassau. Some Orangists had hoped to offer the position to King William I or his son, William, Prince of Orange, which would bring Belgium into personal union with the Netherlands like Luxembourg. The Great Powers <b>also</b> <b>worried</b> that a candidate from another state could risk destabilizing the international balance of power and lobbied for a neutral candidate.|$|E
25|$|Two subdivisions in the Smith River Canyon, one at Castle Bar {{and another}} at Two Creeks, {{occurred}} in the 1960s. These deeply alarmed recreationists, who feared despoliation of this most scenic part of the river. Private landowners <b>also</b> <b>worried</b> about additional development, fearing {{the loss of the}} farming and ranching lifestyle to urbanization as well as the loss of the scenic viewshed they treasured. In response to these concerns, in 1969 the Montana Fish and Game Commission (the rulemaking body for the DFG) designated the Smith a State Recreational Waterway. This banned motorized boating on the Smith.|$|E
25|$|As {{the end of}} the war neared, {{the prisoners}} began to worry about their future {{position}} in Japanese society. A Press article stated that to their own people they were considered dead. In September 1944 the prisoners told a neutral inspector that provision needed to be made for them to return as honourable citizens, or that they be given asylum on a Pacific island. They said if something could not be done mass suicide might result. After {{the end of the}} war they <b>also</b> <b>worried</b> that they could be attacked in New Zealand over the conditions of Japanese prisoner of war camps.|$|E

25|$|When his {{subjects}} {{asked him to}} name {{one of his sons}} as crown prince, Emperor Ling had a dilemma between Liu Bian and Liu Xie, his only two surviving sons. He felt that Liu Bian was unfit to be emperor because he was frivolous and unable to command respect, so he preferred Liu Xie. However, he was <b>also</b> <b>worried</b> that if he chose Liu Xie, Empress He would turn to her half-brother, He Jin, for help. He Jin held the position of General-in-Chief (大將軍) and was a highly influential figure in the imperial court. He ultimately did not name either of his sons as crown prince.|$|E
25|$|With the 14 July Revolution {{taking place}} in Iraq the same year, Western powers feared the fallouts of a {{powerful}} Arab nationalism in the region. Foreign powers were not only concerned about the possible spread of such revolutionary movements in other Arab states, but <b>also</b> <b>worried</b> about losing the control and monopoly over the region's natural oil resources. However, due to discontent over the hegemony of Egypt and after a coup in Syria that introduced a more radical government to power, the United Arab Republic collapsed in 1961. The term United Arab Republic continued {{to be used in}} Egypt until 1971, after the death of Nasser.|$|E
