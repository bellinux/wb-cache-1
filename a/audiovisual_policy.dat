40|$|This paper reviews Italian <b>audiovisual</b> <b>policies,</b> {{in order}} to assess their impact on the {{international}} position of domestic cinema and television producers. Italian <b>audiovisual</b> <b>policies</b> are characterised by a rich set of institutions, regulations and support tools, whose complexity sometimes causes problems of overlapping jurisdictions among different authorities and agencies. Their degree of market access restrictiveness appears to be relatively high, especially considering the discrimination between European and non-European producers. The economic performance of the Italian audiovisual sector has been relatively weak in the nineties, particularly for what concerns the competition with foreign producers. On the other hand, the econometric exercise presented in section 5 seems to show that, at least in the cinema sector, public subsidies {{have a positive impact on}} the domestic market share of Italian producers. This preliminary conclusion is however not enough to justify a positive assessment of Italian <b>audiovisual</b> <b>policies.</b> Many important issues require further investigations. The problems and the data presented in this paper seem to confirm the need to reform the strategy and the tools of public intervention in the audiovisual sector. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

How these networks might be created and, beyond that, how they might function in a sustained and broadly useful manner, {{and the implications of}} this, are issues which crystallise a raft of often complex policy concerns that have emerged, for at least a decade, in historically distant though increasingly connected quarters of electronic network communications. This article breaks new ground in the analysis of the emerging role of the EU by exploring EU NGN policy from a convergence infrastructural and content perspective. Whilst at this stage, despite new ‘policy packaging’, the EU's NGN policy activity is resonant of past telecommunications and <b>audiovisual</b> <b>policies,</b> the article contends that there are key areas where the EU can exercise considerable policy leverage through utilising a combination of formal legal and soft governance capacities.

40|$|The European Union (EU) {{has sought}} to free up its common {{internal}} broadcasting market while guarding against media concentration {{with the aim of}} promoting media pluralism and cultural diversity. Member States have been harmonizing their national broadcasting policies with transfrontier EU directives. Likewise, postcommunist countries in Central and Eastern Europe that desire EU membership have begun aligning their broadcasting policies with EU directives. This paper looks at five candidate CEECs that are creating the competitive markets for broadcasting envisioned by the EU: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia. Until the end of the 1980 s the broadcasting system in these five countries were monopolies controlled by the states. Ten years later dual systems of public and commercial broadcasting were in place. This paper examines the influence of the EU's cultural and <b>audiovisual</b> <b>policies,</b> particularly the "Television Without Frontiers" (TWF) Directive, on changes in the candidate countries' domestic broadcasting policies and institutions. The EU's candidate screening process shows that the five CEECs have made varying degrees of progress in aligning their national broadcasting institutions, laws, and policies with the TWF Directive. This case illustrates the typology of positive, negative, and framing integration described by Knill and Lehmkill. However, questions are raised about the appropriateness of the economic candidate countries.

It compares the Republics of Slovenia and Macedonia, two countries of similar size and population that emerged from the same former-Yugoslav media system. Slovenia is a new EU member state and Macedonia is a candidate country, therefore both are formally bound by EU <b>audiovisual</b> media <b>policy.</b> Europeanization research, particularly in new Member States and candidate countries, has focused on compliance with transposition deadlines and the implementation of specific EU Directives. This study takes a bottom-up approach, making media governance its object of study based on a conceptualisation of governance by Jan Kooiman (2003), but still focused on identifying the role of the EU within that national level governance. It draws on interviews with stakeholders in both countries, examination of secondary data available on the respective media markets, and accounts from civil society actors and regulators to arrive at an overall picture of media governance. It finds that in these two cases the role of Europeanization, defined in this thesis in relation to the EU, centres on the use of EU rules by domestic actors in order to forward their strategic interests. It argues that the media sectors in these two cases are largely resistant to Europeanization because of their small size and the particular relations between media and political elites. This thesis suggests that the media sector may be different from other sectors such as transport, environmental protection, or labour in terms of Europeanization and governance because the role of media in domestic politics. However, this is not a simple story of the democratic and governance failures often attributed to Southern European countries.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{intended}} to give a general overview of the <b>audiovisual</b> <b>policy</b> and audiovisual market of the European Union (EU) linked {{to the issue of}} the Eastern enlargement of the EU. EU <b>audiovisual</b> <b>policy</b> is the arena for divergent interests and arguments, both economic and cultural, European and national. Accession negotiations in the sphere of cultural and <b>audiovisual</b> <b>policy</b> largely came down on legislative alignment with the acquis, in particular with the Television Without Frontiers Directive as the single important piece of audiovisual legislation. Alignment has been achieved by a “second wave” of media laws (1998 - 2002) in Central and Eastern European countries following the “first wave” of media laws {{in the first half of}} the 1990 s. Conflicts do arise mainly as a result of the conflict between national and European interests (culture, identity) on the one hand and the power struggle between the EU and the combined forces of the United States and the World Trade Organization on the other hand. The analysis of the European audiovisual market shows that the Central and Eastern European markets show basically the same weaknesses as the Western European markets: fragmentation into small national markets with only limited cross-border distribution. EU enlargement offers opportunities for Central and Eastern European audiovisual industries such as increased investments and funding, co-operation partners, and enhanced export possibilities.

40|$|This article {{studies the}} link between the Eastern {{enlargement}} of the European Union and issues of <b>audiovisual</b> <b>policy</b> and audiovisual markets. The main link between <b>audiovisual</b> <b>policy</b> and EU enlargement is through alignment with the Community acquis, in particular the Television Without Frontiers Directive. Legislative alignment has been achieved in all Central and Eastern European countries by adopting new media laws. This process can be described one of (neutrally defined) Europeanization. EU enlargement offers opportunities for Central and Eastern European audiovisual industries such as increased investments and funding, cooperation partners, and enhanced export possibilities, but also bears the threat of Europeanization as a process of cultural diffusion or cultural dominance. Both Eastern and Western Europe, however, are culturally and linguistically fragmented. Enlargement, it is argued, basically enlarges the characteristics of the European audiovisual market. Enlargement adds to Europe 'more of the same': more diversity, more languages, and more (audiovisual) cultures. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The French State, and political elites operating within it, have {{a long tradition of}} involvement in the production, management and even the control of language and culture. This has been - and remains - important in terms of the construction and definition of a State-led model of French identity. Against this background, the present thesis examines conceptions of French identity held by political elites, the agents of the State, in relation to language and cultural issues prominent on the policy-making agenda in the 1990 s. The thesis specifically considers the possibility that elite visions of identity may be changing under the influence both of new approaches to French cultural policy-making introduced from the 1980 s by the Socialists, and specifically the Ministry of Culture led by Jack Lang, and of a series of potentially destabilising challenges to French models of cultural policy and identity which have been debated in the 1990 s. In order to examine these issues, the thesis takes three case studies, focusing on political debates in the public arena surrounding a number of language and cultural policy issues which have been perceived as symbols of French identity. The regulation and promotion of the French language, <b>audiovisual</b> broadcasting <b>policy</b> and the Internet are selected as case study areas, which reveal these perceptions, and point to anxieties about identity in the debates which surround them. Thus these debates are used as a means of reexamining contemporary elite perceptions of French identity. This examination is carried out through the close reading of contributions to the debates, made by political figures of significance in each case study area. The term 'political elites' is used in the sense of Pareto's definition (1935, in Parry, 1969, pp. 34, 46) of the elite as a 'governing elite', composed of all political 'influentials', whether or not they act for the State, as part of a government, or indirectly as part of the wider polity, in opposition. The cases tudiesd emonstrateth at elite conceptions of identity in France of the 1990 s, whilst disturbed by contemporary challenges to French cultural policy-making, did not change in any fundamental way. Instead, they illustrated a reversion to traditional, rigid conceptions of identity, rather than the welcoming of more dynamic and hybrid ones...|$|R
40|$|The {{historical}} path of broadband {{development is}} interesting to analyze {{in order to assess}} how the previous policies were interrelated, whether they were consistent, and whether an integrated framework can be formulated. This is of special interest to understand today, as the ICT policy agenda is being discussed around the world, for example the US, Japan, Sweden etc., in order to formulate future strategies. A case in point is the European Commission (EU) which has started a process to formulate a new set of ICT policy goals for 2015, replacing the previous i- 2010 policy agenda. In the EU, the European Commission has considered wide broadband coverage in Europe as crucial for fostering growth and jobs in Europe. Since the 1980 s, telecommunications networks and services in the European Community have been reformed by a number of factors. As the first major initiative in telecommunications made by the European Commission, the 1987 Green Paper {{on the development of the}} common market for telecommunications services and equipment was issued. In the context of this paper, it {{is interesting to}} note that a broadband vision was stated even in the 1987 Green Paper, before broadband started to be adopted. Although the primary objective of the Green Paper was not to discuss broadband development policy, it was accepted at that time on the EU level that broadband infrastructure was essential for future economic and social development. Nowadays, 20 years later, many policies relating to broadband development have been initiated and discussed in the EU. Those policies and initiatives can be categorized into three major approaches. The first approach is a broad policy framework which set the scene and recognized that broadband is strategically important to EU development. Within the first approach, e-Europe 2005 and i 2010 are the major policies. The eEurope 2005 policy was started in the year 2002 and aimed at the development and use of advanced services running on a secure broadband infrastructure. It set widespread availability and use of broadband as one main objective to be attained by the end of 2005. To reach that objective, the European Commission formulated policies to encourage investment in broadband infrastructure, applications and services. Later, a strategic framework, i 2010 – A European Initiative for Growth, has been implemented since 2005 to build towards an integrated approach to information society and <b>audiovisual</b> media <b>policies</b> in the EU. An important development of this framework was the emphasis on broadband as a driver of inclusion and quality of life. Thereby the new policy built towards the three priorities for Europe’s information society, which were the completion of a Single European Information Space, strengthening innovation and investment in ICT research, and achieving an inclusive European information society. The second approach is that of telecommunications regulatory policies. Within this approach, several telecommunications regulatory frameworks have been issued or proposed with an aim to encourage broadband competition in the market − such as local loop unbundling, open access regulation, bit-stream access and functional separation. Recently, the draft recommendation for the regulation of next-generation access networks (NGA) has been proposed to promote broadband and to improve consistency of regulatory frameworks throughout the EU. The third approach concerns non-regulatory government policies. It does not involve broad policy as the first approach does; rather it deals with encouraging broadband infrastructure development through different incentives from government such as state-aid rules. It is interesting to note that this approach of state-aid rules can be considered as a step back to an old-style policy of telecommunications whereby government ownership has been the main vehicle to pursue infrastructure goals. When broadband has been targeted, the policy seems to step back to a preliberalization mode, despite the fact that the telecommunications market has been propelled by competition for a number of years. The crucial points are that each approach is based on different objectives and strategies but all of the approaches consider broadband as a major tool to achieve their respective agendas. Nonetheless, the interrelationship among those approaches has not been investigated and the empirical evidence with regard to the interaction of other forms of public policy and regulation is relatively limited. Against this background, the proposed paper will be structured as follows. First, it will present a brief market overview of broadband penetration from several data sources. Next, a historical overview of broadband policies and initiatives of the three approaches in the European Union will be given, with particular attention to early initiatives. The paper will also analyze the prospect of broadband in various approaches in an integrated structure. Moreover, the paper will discuss whether or not the three different approaches were consistent in terms of encouraging broadband deployment, and whether or not the three policy approaches can achieve high broadband development in the EU. In addition, the paper will address whether or not future broadband policy should be formulated in a more holistic fashion...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the concepts of}} rights and freedoms of citizens to cultural expression and democratic information in political and economic communities. It directly engages with the problematic of defending citizens 2 ̆ 7 rights to communication as a cultural right and a social right. These arguments are founded in a fear of cultural imperialism, a defence of national cultures and an advocacy of cultural diversity within a “European culture”. This author is confident {{that the notion of}} culture, and cultural objectives will be challenged repeatedly at every round of World Trade Organisation negotiations. This thesis takes the view that the annexation of audiovisual products and services is therefore a temporary solution. This thesis prefers to address broadcasting policy and audiovisual services policy from a trade and human rights perspective. It argues that an awareness of human rights in 18 lh century Ireland developed firstly as a by-product of trade with America within the public sphere of market activity. Research suggests that issues of trade autonomy are key aspects of communities’ demands for citizenship and a separate nationhood. It appears that in Ireland 2 ̆ 7 s case, ethnic cultural claims developed later. In adopting this premise, this thesis rejects the view that citizenship demands were predominantly linked with an Irish cultural nationalism. This creed is often the rationale behind the defence of ‘cultural rights’ in relation to media and public service broadcasting. I argue that human rights demands arising from restrictive market practices are voiced in the market and trading community but take on the mantel of a defence of cultural hegemony and a call for separateness in citizenship when in actuality, the basis of their demand for rights is autonomy and independence in commercial and trading policy. This thesis examines the years 1982 - 2002 and the policy strategies of Ireland in relation to Audiovisual Services, and the EU Common Commercial policy that frames their input into multi-lateral trade rounds in the GATT / World Trade Organisation forum. This research {{addresses the}} options at Ireland’s disposal in order to protect national autonomy over its <b>audiovisual</b> <b>policy,</b> and national citizens’ rights to communication, knowledge and information. Findings demonstrate that Ireland has made little effort to restrict market access to foreign market dominance in audiovisual product beyond the EU minimum. Irish governments regularly choose free trade over the protection of national rights, inevitably argued from a cultural basis. This is because, while television might be seen as politically and democratically important, it is not as economically important as the new media industries related to information technology that are beginning to replace agriculture as the mainstay of Ireland’s economic trade. This thesis concludes that as a small Member State in the European Union, the level of sovereignty that Ireland retains over its <b>audiovisual</b> <b>policy</b> diverges from popular convictions that posit EU member states retain national autonomy in the area of EU <b>audiovisual</b> <b>policy...</b>|$|E

In 1993, a new phase {{in the history of the}} European <b>audiovisual</b> <b>policy</b> began, characterized by the concern around the IS and the Convergence. In this context, a positioning regarding digital television arose, conditioning the European policies related to the digitalization of the terrestrial nets in a polarized and subordinated sense.

Yet similar to other non-members, rules were adopted without having a say in their development...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{contemporary}} French cultural diplomacy. Its aim is to determine what are the factors shaping this area of French foreign policy to its current form and what amount of resources is the state dedicating to its soft power. For a better understanding of this issue the first chapter explains the concepts of public and cultural diplomacy, the issue of culture {{and its role in}} international relations and also the method of financing French cultural diplomacy. The thesis further analyses the activities of the French Institute in Prague as the most prominent cultural institution operating in the Czech Republic and Cinema 35 as its constituent part. Apart from such examples, also other instruments of French cultural diplomacy, such as the French Alliance, the French Research Center in Humanities and Social Sciences, Campus France and the French <b>audiovisual</b> <b>policy</b> are contributing to define the current form of French cultural diplomacy, and are therefore dealt with in the last chapter of this thesis...|$|E
