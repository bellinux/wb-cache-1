40|$|To {{think about}} Los Angeles is like {{sitting in front}} of the {{television}} and switching the channels while keeping track of an the shows. It is a complex place: it has many divergent styles and images trying to make up a whole. Los Angeles is about images and imagery; its tradition and commitment to the movie industry and other media makes Los Angeles a logical place for a film center: a center for the moving i~age. Presently there is neither a location for the film festival nor a public building to study and to learn about the motion picture. This thesis explores through design the possibilities for the Los Angeles Film Center located in the existing Pan Pacific Auditorium. Because of the expanding use of visual communication from the media, film and video, I am interested in adopting an architectural form which can display and preserve an infinite amount of visual information. Los Angeles establishes a framework for the film center which is layered with meanings and interpretations. The city evokes a multitude of images visualized and understood at many different levels by many different people. Not only are varied images important, but over time their associations vary and adopt new meanings. The Los Angeles Film Center must be adaptable to) variations and perceptions, yet be an element of the city which maintains its presence. This design therefore acknowledges the larger scale of the city. The existing Pan Pacific facade is already established as a "set piece" in the Los Angeles fabric. The inner structure, the new film center is designed to evoke emotion, to set standards into conflict, as well as to be inspiring and challenging for the visitor. In the design, the existing facade of the Pan Pacific is a linear registration for the activities introduced on the site. The larger city scale, the vastness of Los Angeles is introduced on the site by the automobile ramp which sweeps and rises in front of the entrance. The scale is referenced by maintaining the general direction of Los Angeles, but the steel towers positioned on a shifted grid establish a separate order for the Film Center. There are three basic territories which help to define the Film Center: first the display, projection area with the theatres, exhibitions and other public facilities, second, the library, archives and study building set in the park, in front of the facade and finally the third is the <b>administrative,</b> <b>loading,</b> shipping and receiving area closest to the street The parts of the building are set both to operate as a whole as well as independently from each other. A microcosm of Los Angeles itself, the Film Center is a layering of simultaneous events which offer a multitude of images both real and imagined, perceived and interpreted at varied levels. by Karen Swett.

Paradoxically, this has increased interest in the potential of private sector forest certification schemes as a mechanism not only to promote sustainable forest management but also- and more controversially- to verify legal timber. There is evidence of a convergence between the two streams of practice, with several producer governments said {{to be willing to}} consider certification as a surrogate for formal legality assurance. Whilst such a convergence does offer benefits in terms of reducing the costs and <b>administrative</b> <b>load</b> on producers, it is not without its risks.

RESULTS: The mean response rate by those agreeing to participate was 66 % and remains stable. The mean score of each set (n = 8) was high (63 - 80 %) but scores about the mean varied widely in each set. The positive marking system was satisfactory and provided information equivalent to negative and weighted marking systems.

40|$|As Australian universities’ {{involvement}} in Transnational Education (TNE) continues to grow, little thought {{is given to}} the role of the academic. It is important that academics are engaged positively with TNE in order to mitigate some of the risks associated with TNE. A study of IT academics has shown that while they are less satisfied with TNE than their normal teaching role, they still show a marginal degree of satisfaction with TNE teaching. This paper reports on a qualitative study aimed at exploring and explaining the factors associated with academic satisfaction and TNE in terms of the Job Characteristics Model (Hackman and Oldham 1976). It suggests there is a fine balance between being satisfied and not; the aspects of TNE that are seen to be associated with a higher degree of academic satisfaction (e. g., face-to-face interaction with students, collegial relationships and interactions with TNE teaching staff) need to be encouraged and facilitated through university procedures and policies. On the other hand, those aspects of TNE that cause dissatisfaction (e. g., extra <b>administrative</b> <b>load)</b> need to be understood, managed and mitigated where possible...|$|R
40|$|Networked {{communications}} inherently {{depend on}} the ability of the sender of a message to indicate through some token how the message should be delivered to a particular recipient. The tokens that refer messages to recipients are variously known as routes, addresses,handles, and names} ordered by their relative nearness to network topology vs. human meaning. All four sorts of token refer in some way to a recipient, but they are controlled by different authorities and their meanings depend on different contextual parameters. Today's global Internet employs dynamically determined routes, IP addresses, and domain names. Domain names combine the functions of handles and names. The high value of domain names as names leads to substantial social and legal dispute about their assignment, degrading their value as handles. The time has come to provide a distinct open network handle system (ONHS), using handles that are not meaningful in natural language and are therefore not subject to the disputes surrounding the use of names. A handle service may be deployed easily as a handle domain within the current Domain Name System. In order to minimize the <b>administrative</b> <b>load,</b> and maximize their own autonomy, netizens may use public-key cryptography to assign their own handles...|$|R
40|$|University {{academic}} performance is normally measured against criteria {{for teaching and}} learning, research output, academic citizenship and more recently community engagement. Academics spend a considerable portion of their time on administration matters – {{at the expense of}} teaching and learning, research and community engagement time despite having administrative support staff available to support them. This use of their time on administrative matters affects their performance and effectiveness on their core functions. This problem is also exacerbated by declining governmental funding and by pressures from university management to increase research output in terms of completed studies of masters and doctorate candidates and publications in accredited journals as a means of supplementing the university income. This study supports the view that academics prefer a structure in which there is increased quality and increased effectiveness of administrative support services resulting in decreasing <b>administrative</b> <b>loads</b> on academics through the use of shared services. Shared services structures are now being widely used by many large organisations which has resulted in improving the performance of administrative supporting services and in increasing the productivity of the core functions similar to those that reside within academia.

An online submission program (submit) was developed that specifically addresses the needs of beginning programming students by providing automatic and instant feedback to a student’s programming efforts. Traditionally, this feedback was provided by staff in scheduled laboratory sessions, yet the amount of individual attention a particular student received was haphazard. In addition, the introduction of the submit program has reduced the marking and <b>administrative</b> <b>load</b> associated with providing timely feedback to students for participating staff. submit is more than just an on-line letter box for students to post their programs. submit also provides instant feedback which encourages students to improve their programs to meet all given requirements as well as to improve programming style. In order to assess the effectiveness of the submit program over four trials, student responses to questionnaires were collated and support some tentative conclusions as to the effectiveness of submit as a learning aid to students. Staff opinion from those involved in the day-to-day teaching of Java programming was also solicited. These responses have been very positive, especially from the staff that supervise laboratory work. ...|$|R

Tribute has been paid to the achievements of the predecessors as well as to those of the present members of the staff. Due to the increase in the educational and <b>administrative</b> <b>load</b> caused by the larger number of students over the past few years, however, the lecturers find it more and more difficult to pay the necessary attention to their research. Post-graduate students usually contribute greatly towards research in a university department. In the Veterinary Science Faculty, however, the majority of post-graduate students study part-time for financial reasons. Whereas fulltime students contribute towards the activities of the department, part-time students do not contribute in the same way. A request is therefore made that some form of financial assistance be made available for post graduate study in the Veterinary Science Faculty. This financial assistance can be used for the employment of assistants, as in the medical Faculty, or for part-time research posts. There is an increasing demand for post-graduate veterinary education and the introduction of such appointments should prove to be of great value in future research. [URL]...|$|R

These investigations were mainly based on simulations of scenarios involving up to 100 nodes (usually 50 nodes) and relaxed (too unrealistic) data traffic conditions. Many routing protocols in such setting offer the same performance, and many potential problems stay undetected. At the same time, an ad hoc network may not want (or be able) {{to limit the number of}} hosts involved in the network.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to develop a method for {{assessing}} Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) according to various criteria, and to develop recommendations to improve statements and the EIA procedure. To develop a method to assess report quality, the most significant current methods were examined. Their advantages and disadvantages were analyzed and, as a result, the most appropriate method structure was defined – a control list with quality criteria. To determine the quality criteria of an EIA, the effective basic principles of the EIA were formulated based on sources in the literature. During the study, the three most significant elements of a quality EIA were defined. These have been incorporated into the method developed in this project as the most significant criteria. As a result, a systematic method to assess an individual EIS was developed. The method includes quality criteria, which have been determined to be the most significant as a result of an analysis of the efficiency of the EIA procedure. The method has been adapted to the planned amendments in the EIA directive, incorporating these criteria. The structure of the method adheres to another fundamental goal of the directive's amendments – to decrease the <b>administrative</b> <b>load</b> of the EIA procedure. It is anticipated that with the aid of this method, by assessing only the most important report elements in depth, that the time necessary for a competent institution to evaluate a report will be reduced...|$|R
