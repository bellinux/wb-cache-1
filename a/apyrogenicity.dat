40|$|UNLABELLED: Our {{goal was}} to design and {{manufacture}} a kit under good manufacturing practices (GMP) for the preparation of (111) In-DTPA-hEGF Injection, a novel targeted radiotherapeutic agent for advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -positive breast cancer. METHODS: Human EGF (hEGF) was derivatized with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and then purified by size-exclusion chromatography and ultrafiltration. Kits were prepared by dispensing 0. 25 mg (1 mL) of DTPA-hEGF in 1 mol/L sodium acetate buffer [pH 6. 0] into single-dose glass vials. Raw materials were pharmacopoieal or reagent grade according to the American Chemical Society and were tested for identity and purity. Kits were tested for protein concentration, purity and homogeneity (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography), pH, clarity and color, volume, DTPA substitution, labeling efficiency, receptor binding to MDA-MB- 468 human breast cancer cells, and sterility and <b>apyrogenicity.</b> (111) In-DTPA-hEGF Injection was tested for pH, radionuclidic and radiochemical purity, clarity and color, and sterility and <b>apyrogenicity.</b> RESULTS: Four lots of kits and 8 lots of (111) In-DTPA-hEGF Injection passed all quality specifications. The labeling efficiency was 94 %- 99 % with 115 - 773 MBq (111) In chloride added to a single kit. (111) In-DTPA-hEGF exhibited preserved receptor binding against MDA-MB- 468 cells (affinity constant [K(a) ], 0. 9 - 1. 1 x 10 (7) L/mol; maximum number of binding sites per cell [B(max) ], 1. 1 - 2. 2 x 10 (6) sites per cell). In addition, labeling of aliquots of the kit suggested that a single vial could be labeled with up to 3, 083 MBq (111) In while maintaining a radiochemical purity of > 90 %. Kits were stable for > 90 d and (111) In-DTPA-hEGF Injection was stable for > 24 h stored at 4 degrees C. CONCLUSION: The kit formulation is suitable for preparing (111) In-DTPA-hEGF Injection for a phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced EGFR-positive breast cancer. Establishment of the GMP processes for (111) In-DTPA-hEGF Injection provides a useful example of manufacturing biotechnology-based investigational radiopharmaceuticals in an academic environment for early phase I clinical trials...|$|E
30|$|Methods: 177 Lu-radiolabelling was {{performed}} using the cassette-based ModularLab PharmTracer® synthesizer (EZAG, Berlin, Germany) and starting activities of 9.0 - 19.0 GBq 177 LuCl 3 (no-carrier-added; itg, Munich, Germany) in 0.5  ml 0.04  M HCl. For the somatostatin analogues, approximately 250 - 500  μg of DOTA-TATE (ABX, Radeberg, Germany) or HA-DOTA-TATE (PiChem, Graz, Austria) – calculated as 1  μg peptide/ 40  MBq 177 LuCl 3 [*]+[*] 10  % peptide, dissolved in deionized water – were reacted at 80  °C/ 20  min in 0.57  M ascorbate buffer, pH  4.5. For DOTA-PSMA (ABX), approximately 130 - 270  μg of DOTA-PSMA – 1  μg peptide/ 65  MBq 177 LuCl 3 peptide, dissolved in Ethanol (48  %) – was reacted at 90  °C/ 10  min in 0.57  M ascorbate buffer, pH  4.5 and with 200  μl Ethanol (96  %). All precursors were of GMP quality. Crude 177 Lu-DOTA-TATE/-HA-DOTA-TATE was purified on a C 18 SPE cartridge without any further dilution, whereas 177 Lu-DOTA-PSMA was first prediluted with 2  ml saline (0.9  %), before purification on a C 18 -SepPak by washing with 2  ml saline (0.9  %). Elution {{was done with}} 2  ml ethanol (48  %) and the product was transferred and 0.22  μm-filtrated to the product vial together with 16  ml saline (0.9  %). To all 177 Lu-DOTA-peptide-formulations 0.5 - 1.2  ml DTPA (3  mg/ml) was added. Full radiopharmaceutical quality control {{was performed}} for all 177 Lu-peptide formulations (e.g. radio-TLC-, HPLC-, pH-, sterility- and <b>apyrogenicity</b> testing).|$|E
40|$|Using an {{inexpensive}} device and the multichannel scaling mode (MCS) of a multichannel analyzer (MCA), {{the determination of}} radiochemical purity as distinguished by the radiochromatographic technique may be easily and accurately performed. The availability of the sterile radiopharmaceutical kit has brought tremendous change and expansion {{to the practice of}} nuclear medicine. With the Mo- 99 /Tc- 99 m generator and the large number of commercially available agents for tagging with Tc- 99 m, clinicians may now choose from a diverse array of diagnostically specific kits. These kits have definite advantages over the previous on-site method of radiopharmaceutical preparation. In the past, radiopharmaceutical com-pounding from bulk reagents was generally limited to large medical centers with trained personnel and adequate facilities to perform manufacturing procedures. Under this arragement, it was the responsibility of each nuclear pharmacy or laboratory to verify total quality control of the compounded agent. Presently, it is the commercial manufacturer's responsibility to establish the quality of each kit ingredient as well as sterility and <b>apyrogenicity</b> in accordance with current Food and Drug Administration guidelines { 1). Assurance for final radiochemical purity following addition of the radiolabel remains, however, the responsibility of the user who prepares each kit in its final dosage form. Image quality may be significantly compromised by the presence of excessive quantities of radiochemical contaminants due either to improper preparation of these kits or oxidative decomposition following tagging with the radiolabel (2, 3). Numerous paper and instant thin layer chromatography (ITLC) techniques have been introduced to resolve the presenc...|$|E
40|$|Aim. White {{blood cell}} (WBC) {{labelling}} requires isolation of cells from patient's blood {{under sterile conditions}} using sterile materials, buffers and disposables under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions. Till now, this limited the use of white blood cell scintigraphy (WBC-S) only to well equipped laboratories with trained personnel. We invented, developed and tested a disposable, sterile, closed device for blood manipulation, WBC purification and radionuclide labelling without exposing patient's blood and the operator to contamination risks. This device prototype and a final industrialized device (Leukokit (R)) were tested for WBC labelling and compared to standard procedure. Leukokit (R) was also tested in an international multi-centre study for easiness of WBC purification and labelling. Methods. On the device prototype we tested in parallel, with blood samples from 7 volunteers, the labelling procedure compared to the standard procedure of the International Society of Radio labeled Blood Elements (ISORBE) consensus protocol with respect to cell recovery, labelling efficiency (LE), cell viability (Trypan Blue test) and sterility (haemoculture). On the final Leukokit (R) we tested the biocompatibifity of all components, and again the LE, erythro-sedimentation rate, cell viability, sterility and <b>apyrogenicity.</b> ACD-A, HES and PBS provided by Leukokit (R) were also compared to Heparin, Dextran and autologous plasma, respectively. In 4 samples, we tested the chemotactic activity of purified WBC against 1 mg/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and chemotaxis of Tc- 99 m-HMPAO-labelled WBC (925 MBq) was {{compared to that of}} unlabelled cells. For the multi-centre study, 70 labellings were performed with the Leukokit by 9 expert operators and 3 beginners from five centers using blood from both patients and volunteers. Finally, Media-Fill tests were performed by 3 operators on two different days (11 procedures) by replacing blood and kit reagents with bacterial culture media (Tryptic Soy Broth) and testing sterility of aliquots of the medium at the end of procedure. Results. Tests performed with the prototype showed no significant differences with the standard procedure but a faster and safer approach. Tests performed with the final Leukokit (R) confirmed full biocompatibility, sterility and <b>apyrogenicity</b> of all reagents and plastic ware. Average WBC recovery with Leukokit (R) was comparable to that of the ISORBE protocol (117 x 10 (6) +/- 24 x 10 (6) vs. 132 x 10 (6) +/- 29 x 10 (6) cells, P=not significant). No differences in red blood cells and platelet content were observed. LE was 82 % +/- 3 % for Leukokit (R) and 65 +/- 5 % for control (P= 0. 0003) being PBS vs autologous plasma the main reason of such difference. Cell viability was always > 99. 9 % in both conditions. Chemotactic tests showed no differences between all Leukokit samples and controls. Haemocultures and Media-Fill tests were always sterile. The procedure was well accepted by expert operators and beginners, with a very fast learning curve (confidence after 2 +/- 2 labellings). Conclusion. The invented device offers high level of protection to operators and patients. The derived Leukokit (R) is safe and easy to use, and gives a high LE of WBC without affecting cell viability and function. Being a registered closed, sterile medical device, it may allow easier and faster WBC labelling that is not limited to only well equipped laboratories. Also simultaneously labelling of multiple patients is possible...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of chelate, inulin, and albumin {{have been}} demonstrated to be similar in the cerebrospinal fluid (7) which make each of these agents poten tially useful in cisternography. Improved cisterno-grams have been obtained with albumin labeled with 99 mjc (2, 3). It is specially suitable for the study that can be completed within 24 hr. In prolonged studies, however, 131 I-albumin or 169 Yb-chelate are pre ferred (4). The low radiation dose from 99 mTc is an advantage, but adequate precautions are neces sary to have {{the quality of the}} radiopharmaceutical suitable for intrathecal injection. It is not easy to be assured of the sterility and the <b>apyrogenicity</b> of a 99 mTc-albumin preparation prior to the adminis tration. The potential toxicity of albumin has also been recognized, and substitution of inulin for albu min has been proposed (5). The chelate is not toxic if used in small amounts (6), and no reaction has been observed with 10 !lYb-chelate when used in a large number of patients for cisternography (7). At present a simple method of labeling chelate (DTPA) with 9 i) mTc is available (8) which can be modified for use in cisternography. Improved qual ity control of 9 ! 1 "'Tc-DTPA is possible compared with n!""Tc-inulin or 9 !""Tc-albumin. MATERIALS AND METHODS Kits were prepared in batches for use up to 2 weeks with CaNa. DTPA and trace of SnCL under No atmosphere using the basic method of Eckelman and Richards (8). Approximately 25 mCi of 9 i) mTcO 4 -, in a volume of 1 ml or less were added into the kit before the study. After a minute of gentle mixing, 10 ml of isotonic saline were added. One milliliter of the solu tion contained 2 mCi of ni) mTc chelated in the pres ence of about 400 //. g of the calcium salt of DTPA. Doses of 1 ml or less were used for cisternography in adult patients. Children received reduced doses. Quality control tests were carried out with kits for each batch of preparation before use.
