25|$|In the Annales of Tacitus, it is {{mentioned}} {{that after the}} defeat of 9 BC Augustus divided the Germans by making a separate peace with the Sugambri and Suebi under their king Maroboduus. This is the first mention of any permanent king of the Suebi. However, Maroboduus' people was in most sources {{referred to as the}} king of the Marcomanni, a tribal name that had already been distinct from the Suebi in Caesar's time. (As discussed above, it is not sure which Suebi were the Suebi of Caesar, but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> distinguished from the Marcomanni.) However, Maroboduus was also described as Suebian, and his association with the Marcomanni more specifically comes after the Langobards and Semnones were specifically said to have left his kingdom, having previously been under his rule. At some point in this period the Marcomanni had come to be settled in the forested regions once inhabited by the Boii, in and around Bohemia, under his rule.|$|E
500|$|Following {{his first}} wife's death in 1598, Coke married Lady Elizabeth Cecil, widow of Sir William (Newport) Hatton and {{daughter}} of Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter, a desirable marriage {{due to her}} wealth; {{when he found out}} that Bacon was also pursuing her hand, Coke acted with all speed to complete the ceremony. It was held at a private house at the wrong time, rather than at a church between 8 and 12 in the morning; all involved parties were prosecuted for breaching ecclesiastical law, and Coke had to beg for a pardon. It is said that Coke first suggested marrying Elizabeth to Sir Robert Cecil her half-uncle, at the funeral of Lord Burghley, Coke's patron; he needed to ensure that he would continue his rise under Burghley's son, Cecil, and did this by marrying into the family. Elizabeth was 26years younger than Coke, hot-tempered and articulate; Boyer wrote that [...] "if she and Coke were not compatible, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> well-matched". Their marriage having broken down in 1604, his wife Elizabeth {{went on to become a}} formidable protagonist and thorn in his side.|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese {{were running}} low on {{ammunition}} and food. They rarely fired unless {{they had a}} good target. Potts recorded in his report that enemy morale was good, however [...] "Food captured in the field kitchens consisted mainly of bamboo shoots, roots and vegetable matter generally. Evidence of cannibalism occurred on two occasions, flesh being cut from the calf and thigh of dead Japanese". As Bougainville was now a very low priority theatre, the Australians also suffered from supply problems. Inadequate shipping, artillery, ammunition and medical supplies hampered Potts' efforts. The 27 Battalion diary recorded on 1 July; [...] "We've been promised tanks but they have yet to be sighted ... the water situation is also difficult. The L of C ... is over 3000 yards long, 2500 yards of which cannot be covered, and consequently enables the Jap to ambush it just when he likes". However <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> neither starving nor abandoned totally by their hierarchy, like the Japanese.|$|E

2500|$|The clinician-historian Joel Braslow {{argues that}} from malarial therapy onward to lobotomy, {{physical}} psychiatric therapies [...] "spiral {{closer and closer}} to the interior of the brain" [...] with this organ increasingly taking [...] "center stage as a source of disease and site of cure." [...] For Roy Porter, once the doyen of medical history, the often violent and invasive psychiatric interventions developed during the 1930s and 1940s are indicative of both the well-intentioned desire of psychiatrists to find some medical means of alleviating the suffering of the vast number of patients then in psychiatric hospitals and also the relative lack of social power of those same patients to resist the increasingly radical and even reckless interventions of asylum doctors. Many doctors, patients and family members of the period believed that despite potentially catastrophic consequences, the results of lobotomy were seemingly positive in many instances or, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> deemed as such when measured next to the apparent alternative of long-term institutionalisation. Lobotomy has always been controversial, but for a period of the medical mainstream, it was even feted and regarded as a legitimate if desperate remedy for categories of patients who were otherwise regarded as hopeless. Today, lobotomy has become a disparaged procedure, a byword for medical barbarism and an exemplary instance of the medical trampling of patients' rights.|$|E
2500|$|Bonfires {{continued}} to be {{a key part of the}} festival in the modern era. All hearth fires and candles would be doused before the bonfire was lit, generally on a mountain or hill. Ronald Hutton writes that [...] "To increase the potency of the holy flames, in Britain <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> often kindled by the most primitive of all means, of friction between wood." [...] In the 19th century, for example, John Ramsay described Scottish Highlanders kindling a need-fire or force-fire at Beltane. Such a fire was deemed sacred. In the 19th century, the ritual of driving cattle between two fires—as described in Sanas Cormaic almost 1000 years before—was still practised across most of Ireland and in parts of Scotland. Sometimes the cattle would be driven [...] "around" [...] a bonfire or be made to leap over flames or embers. The people themselves would do likewise. In the Isle of Man, people ensured that the smoke blew over them and their cattle. When the bonfire had died down, people would daub themselves with its ashes and sprinkle it over their crops and livestock. Burning torches from the bonfire would be taken home, where they would be carried around the house or boundary of the farmstead and would be used to re-light the hearth. From these rituals, it is clear that the fire was seen as having protective powers. Similar rituals were part of May Day, Midsummer or Easter customs in other parts of the British Isles and mainland Europe. According to Frazer, the fire rituals are a kind of imitative or sympathetic magic. According to one theory, they were meant to mimic the Sun and to [...] "ensure a needful supply of sunshine for men, animals, and plants". According to another, they were meant to symbolically [...] "burn up and destroy all harmful influences".|$|E

60|$|But, to {{conclude}} with what brevity I can, I will only add this, in defence {{of our present}} writers, that, if they reach not some excellencies of Ben Jonson, (which no age, I am confident, ever shall) yet, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> above that meanness of thought which I have taxed, and which is frequent in him.|$|R

60|$|Poor Esemkofu! {{they were}} but miserable and {{starving}} bushmen who, driven into that place of ill omen many years ago, had adopted this means, {{the only one}} open to them, to keep the life in their wretched bodies.

60|$|But on {{the beach}} of Deal justice and propriety in regard to names are not {{necessarily}} held in great repute. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not so a few years ago. Smuggling, as has been said, was rather prevalent in days gone by. Indeed, {{the man who was}} not a smuggler was an exception to the rule, if such a man ever existed. During their night expeditions, boatmen were often under the necessity of addressing each other in hoarse whispers, at times and in circumstances when coast-guard ears were uncommonly acute. Hence, in order to prevent inconvenient recognition, the men were wont to give each other nicknames, which nicknames descended frequently to their offspring.|$|E
