25|$|Mode 7 was a Teletext mode, {{extremely}} economical {{on memory}} and an original requirement {{due to the}} BBC's own use of broadcast teletext (Ceefax). It also made the computer useful as a Prestel terminal. The teletext characters were generated on board, for use with monitors and TV sets without a Teletext receiver. Train time displays at UK stations were driven by BBC Master computers in this mode until around the late 1990s. Mode 7 used only 1 KB for video RAM by storing each character as its <b>ASCII</b> <b>code,</b> rather than its bitmap image as was needed for the other modes.|$|E
25|$|Checksum – Each note has {{a unique}} serial number. The {{remainder}} from dividing the serial number by 9 gives checksum corresponding to the initial letter indicated on the note. Using {{a variation of the}} divisibility rule shortcut, the remainder from division by 9 can easily be found by adding the constituent digits and, if the sum still does not make the remainder obvious, adding the digits of the sum. Alternatively, substituting the letter with its ASCII value makes the resulting number exactly divisible by 9. Taking the same example, Z10708476264, the <b>ASCII</b> <b>code</b> for Z is 90, so the resulting number is 9010708476264. Dividing by 9 yields a remainder of 0. Using the divisibility rule again, the result can be checked speedily since the addition of all digits gives 54; 5 + 4 = 9—so the number is divisible by 9, or 9010708476264 modulo 9 is 0.|$|E
40|$|In poly {{alphabetic}} substitution {{the plain}} texts letters are enciphered differently {{according to their}} position. The name poly alphabetic {{suggests that there are}} more than one key so we have used two keys combination instead of just one, in order to produce the cipher text. We can also use three or more keys to make the enciphering process more complicated. In this paper have produced <b>ASCII</b> <b>Codes</b> of the plain text and then we have reversed it said reverse <b>ASCII</b> <b>Codes</b> and then we have generated two keys K 1 is generated by addition of reverse <b>ASCII</b> <b>Codes</b> and K 2 is generated by addition of <b>ASCII</b> <b>Codes.</b> Then these K 1 and K 2 Keys are alternatively applied on Reverse <b>ASCII</b> <b>codes</b> in order to produce cipher text. On the Destination hand Deciphering is used to produce the plain text again. Our technique generates random cipher text for the same plain text and this is the major advantage of our technique.
