5|$|In {{the first}} few decades {{following}} the journal's establishment, leading authors in The Accounting Review tended to write articles that would {{be of interest to}} accounting practitioners. The journal published articles that focused on accounting education and issues related to particular industries and trade groups, with many articles using <b>anecdotal</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>and</b> hypothetical illustrations. The longest-serving editor during this period was Eric Kohler, an accounting practitioner; Kohler served as editor from 1928 to 1942.|$|E
25|$|GHB {{has also}} been {{associated}} with a withdrawal syndrome of insomnia, anxiety, and tremor that usually resolves within three to twenty-one days. The withdrawal syndrome can be severe producing acute delirium and may require hospitalization in an intensive care unit for management. Management of GHB dependence involves considering the person's age, comorbidity and the pharmacological pathways of GHB. The mainstay of treatment for severe withdrawal is supportive care and benzodiazepines for control of acute delirium, but larger doses are often required compared to acute delirium of other causes (e.g. > 100mg/d of diazepam). Baclofen has been suggested as an alternative or adjunct to benzodiazepines based on <b>anecdotal</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>and</b> some animal data. However, there is less experience {{with the use of}} baclofen for GHB withdrawal, and additional research in humans is needed. Baclofen was first suggested as an adjunct because benzodiazepines do not affect GABAB receptors and thus have no cross-tolerance with GHB while baclofen, which works via GABAB receptors, is cross-tolerant with GHB and may be more effective in alleviating withdrawal effects of GHB.|$|E
30|$|There is much <b>anecdotal</b> <b>evidence</b> of over-employment <b>and</b> bloated bureaucracies in HRCs, as job {{creation}} is typically {{driven by the}} need to provide jobs for new labor market entrants rather than by administrative needs. Administrations often perform poorly due to overstaffing and weak incentive systems [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} individual human operators on the fuel efficiency of power plants. Although electricity generation is a fuel and capital intensive enterprise, <b>anecdotal</b> <b>evidence,</b> interviews, <b>and</b> empirical analysis {{support the hypothesis that}} labor, particularly power plant operators, can have a non-trivial impact on the operating efficiency of the plant. We present evidence to demonstrate these effects and survey the policies and practices of electricity producing firms that either reduce or exacerbate fuel efficiency differences across individual plant operators. ...|$|R

It also studies the factors contributing to deflation in Hong Kong following the Asian financial crisis (i. e. during the period from 1998 to 2003) and finds that declining import prices were the main culprit. Consistent with earlier studies on the subject <b>and</b> <b>anecdotal</b> <b>evidence,</b> wages <b>and</b> prices in Hong Kong are found to be (relatively) flexible.

25|$|Feaver {{argued that}} his theory was {{different}} from other theories or models {{in that it was}} purely deductive, based on democratic theory rather than on <b>anecdotal</b> <b>evidence,</b> <b>and</b> better enabled analysis of day-to-day decisions and actions {{on the part of the}} civilian and military leadership It operated at the intersection of Huntington's institutional approach and Janowitz's sociological point of view. Huntington concentrated on the relationship between civilian leadership and the military qua institution while Janowitz focused on the relationship of the military qua individuals to American society. Agency theory provided a link between the two enabling an explanation of how civil-military relations work on a day-to-day basis. Specifically, agency theory would predict that the result of a regime of intrusive monitoring by the civilian leadership combined with shirking on the part of the military would result in the highest levels of civil-military conflict. Feaver suggested that post-Cold War developments had so profoundly reduced the perceived costs of monitoring and reduced the perceived expectation of punishment that the gap between what civilians ask the military to do and what the military would prefer to do had increased to unprecedented levels.|$|E

2500|$|Another claim about {{cannabis}} is that impairment due {{to smoking}} it lasts many days after using it, since THC {{is stored in}} the fat cells, leading to a low-grade haze long after the primary high is gone. [...] This myth is based primarily on <b>anecdotal</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>and</b> the known fact that urine drug tests remain positive for at least several days after using, and longer for regular users. [...] The tests however measure non-psychoactive metabolites, not active THC. [...] And the blood levels of THC generally fall well below the psychoactive threshold within 2–4 hours of smoking (4–8 hours after oral use). [...] A cannabis equivalent of a hangover may occur the morning after taking high doses, but even that ends much sooner than the legend suggests. [...] Although smoking cannabis on a Friday night would most likely test positive in a urinalysis Monday, no amount of the psychoactive effect would be retained by that time.|$|E
