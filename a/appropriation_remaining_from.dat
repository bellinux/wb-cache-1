5000|$|At a 1988 {{joint meeting}} of the Conference of Chief Justices and the Conference of State Court Administrators the {{participants}} formulated resolutions directing each chief justice to create a task force {{in his or her}} jurisdiction to study [...] "gender bias and minority concerns." [...] This effort resulted in a comprehensive overview of issues impacting women in the various state judiciaries. Starting in 1992 with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the federal judiciary followed suit and sought to investigate any gender bias that might exist in the courts and seek ways to remedy the problems. The progress made by these courts was almost terminated in 1995, when the new Republican majority that swept into Congress under the Contract with America sought to cut off funding that had been provided to run these task forces on the federal level. The new majority [...] "believed that bias task forces by the federal judiciary were both unnecessary and undesirable." [...] However, the <b>appropriation</b> <b>remained</b> intact and tasks forces, such as Chief Judge Sloviter's Third Circuit Task Force, could continue to pursue their charters.|$|R
