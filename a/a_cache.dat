5|$|Common ravens {{have been}} {{observed}} calling wolves {{to the site of}} dead animals. The wolves open the carcass, leaving the scraps more accessible to the birds. They watch where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed pretending to make <b>a</b> <b>cache</b> without actually depositing the food, presumably to confuse onlookers.|$|E
5|$|FBI agents arrested Kaczynski on April 3, 1996, at his cabin, {{where he}} was found in an unkempt state.

Pike uses a serendipitous temperance union parade to shield their getaway, and many citizens are killed in the crossfire.|$|E

In a hearing on June 23, 2005, Massino finalized his deal and plead guilty to ordering the Sciascia murder. For this and his 2004 conviction he was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences, with a possible reduction depending on his service as a witness.

5|$|Computer systems {{make use}} of caches—small and fast {{memories}} located close to the processor which store temporary copies of memory values (nearby in both the physical and logical sense). Parallel computer systems have difficulties with caches that may store the same value {{in more than one}} location, with the possibility of incorrect program execution. These computers require <b>a</b> <b>cache</b> coherency system, which keeps track of cached values and strategically purges them, thus ensuring correct program execution. Bus snooping {{is one of the most}} common methods for keeping track of which values are being accessed (and thus should be purged). Designing large, high-performance cache coherence systems is a very difficult problem in computer architecture. As a result, shared memory computer architectures do not scale as well as distributed memory systems do.|$|E
50|$|In computing, <b>a</b> page <b>cache,</b> {{sometimes}} {{also called}} disk <b>cache,</b> is <b>a</b> transparent <b>cache</b> for the pages originating from a secondary storage device {{such as a}} hard disk drive (HDD).

40|$|Abstract—This paper compares two {{proposed}} {{alternatives to}} conventional instruction caches: a scratchpad memory (SPM) and <b>a</b> method <b>cache.</b> The comparison considers the true worst-case execution time (WCET) and the estimated WCET bound of programs using either an SPM or <b>a</b> method <b>cache,</b> using {{large numbers of}} randomly generated programs. For these programs, we find that <b>a</b> method <b>cache</b> is preferable to an SPM if the true WCET is used, because it leads to execution times that are no greater than those for SPM, and are often lower. However, we also find that analytical pessimism is a significant problem for <b>a</b> method <b>cache.</b> If WCET bounds are derived by analysis, the WCET bounds for an instruction SPM are often lower than the bounds for <b>a</b> method <b>cache.</b> This means that an SPM may be preferable in practical systems.
