5|$|From {{the very}} beginning, {{from the first}} moment I may almost say, of my {{acquaintance}} with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> known you a month before I felt {{that you were the}} last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.|$|E
500|$|The {{book has}} {{eighteen}} chapters with a two-page preface, which explains {{his experience with}} Metamorphosis and how this book complements it. The thesis of this book is identified by one reviewer as: [...] "the importance of childhood's formative years {{for the development of}} the person. In Suzuki's case, it is the effects of racism, notably time spent in BC's internment camps during the Second World War, that still haunt him." [...] In an interview, Suzuki said, [...] "my drive to do well has been motivated by the desire to demonstrate to my fellow Canadians that my family <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> deserved to be treated as we were". Suzuki identifies a turning point of his life as winning his high school's student presidential election. He initially refused to run believing he was not popular enough. His father encouraged him, saying: [...] "There's no disgrace in losing... The important thing is trying." [...] Suzuki ran and unexpectedly won with an [...] "outsider" [...] platform.|$|E
60|$|It was a weak {{complaint}} to have made, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> meant to make it. I told her so, {{as she sat}} brooding after this outburst.|$|E
60|$|You {{might give}} her these. I got them {{specially}} for her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>n't</b> <b>had</b> a chance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{too have}} eaten no food, neither <b>have</b> <b>I</b> drunk water, {{since the day}} the gazelle died. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> spoken, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> laughed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My {{girls are}} now {{provided}} for,' said Mr Pecksniff. 'They are now happily provided for, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> laboured in vain!' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} that Jerry <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been {{interfered}} with on the streets, and I believed he could go where he pleased, provided it was not too near the encampments.|$|E
60|$|I was disgusted {{to think}} that she had caught me napping, and that she had been near me in the House <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> known it, but I said nothing of this.|$|E
6000|$|... "Flora and Blanche did," [...] said Ethel; [...] "I {{thought you}} did not want me to go, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> time. Besides, a London grand young lady--oh!" [...] and Ethel {{shook her head in}} disgust.|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes, I am {{accustomed}} to {{climbing up the}} cliffs on the Yorkshire coast, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> the least fear of losing my head.” ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{seen how}} the {{foundations}} of the world are laid, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> the least doubt that it will stand a good while.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe it}} is more than three years since that abominable concert at Wandsworth; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> heard you sing since," [...] said Elinor.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{friend in}} Paris sent me word, and his {{messenger}} did his work well, else had Monsieur de Garnache {{been here before}} him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> so much as had the mercy of this forewarning." ...|$|E
60|$|My mother {{remained}} {{near one}} of the loopholes {{at the rear of the}} house, also on the alert, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> moved from the position taken up when we made our first poor preparations for the defense.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{anger of}} the Pale Face Chief {{and of his}} countrymen is as the hurricane," [...] I said, scarce believing my own ears. For a lad is {{imitative}} by nature, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> listened to the interpreters for three days without profit.|$|E
6000|$|The {{weather has}} grievously {{depressed}} me this last week, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been fit {{to speak to}} anybody. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> much interruption {{in the early part}} of it though, from a pleasant visitor; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been able to look rightly at your pretty little book. Nevertheless, I'm quite sure your strength is in private letter writing, and that a curious kind of shyness prevents your doing yourself justice in print. You might also surely have found a more pregnant motto about bird's nests! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Most unlucky," [...] said Mrs. Poynsett. [...] "I {{am afraid}} you will doubt about coming again, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> one word about our Frankie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{wish the}} time away, lad," [...] my comrade said gravely. [...] "It {{may be that}} you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> overly many minutes of life left." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I presume not. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> time {{to explain}} it to you when we were upon the cliffs, and so I simply {{directed}} you to keep back of us. That would have prevented all trouble, if you had only obeyed." ...|$|E
60|$|Peter Sitz ceased {{speaking}} very suddenly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> {{the courage}} to ask him how those prisoners suffered; I could imagine that {{they came to a}} most horrible end, and knew that my worst picturing of it would fall far short of the reality.|$|E
60|$|After supper {{the promised}} key was {{secretly}} conveyed to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> the least difficulty in liberating my friend in misfortune. Luckily {{the man who}} took me to Marcos left us alone for some time, and I related my conversation with the fat woman.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, John, I would not. Once I went on {{my knees}} to a man, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> {{forgotten}} the lesson he taught me. Do your worst." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, Aunt!" [...] exclaimed Kate, {{her eyes}} flashing. [...] "I never spoke one untrue word to you; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> now--nor ever. <b>I</b> never deceived." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I do not know," [...] {{said the}} {{somewhat}} startled Endymion; [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>not</b> {{thought much about}} it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> yet reached a parliamentary age." ...|$|R
60|$|MISS FOSTER. Well, and that's true, Barbara, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> remarked it. I {{must take}} her seriously to task. No young lady in her {{position}} should neglect her correspondence. (Opening a letter.) Here's from that dear ridiculous boy, the Cornet, announcing his arrival for to-day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you got my letter, Charlie?" [...] Sir Marmaduke asked, {{when the}} first {{greetings}} were over. [...] "And yet, I do not see how {{you could have done}} so. It is little over a fortnight since I wrote, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> looked for you for another month yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{brought him}} home with us, {{but when the}} next mail went, the fever was still so high, that I {{thought it would be}} only alarm to you to write, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> half a story either, though you may guess how proud I was of my nephew." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What <b>have</b> <b>I</b> done?' said poor Gabriel. 'It {{was agreed}} that Mr Edward's name {{was never to}} be mentioned, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> spoken of him, have I?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{arrived here}} {{yesterday}} afternoon," [...] he said, [...] "with a trunk. She went straight up to Miss Delora's room, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> seen them apart since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! {{will they}} come? The doubt {{is more than}} a woman can bear. All three in one ship--think of that! <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> heard of them for months!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Jos. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> outlived thee; but pray take [...] Comfort! We have {{struggled}} long; and they who strive [...] With Fortune win or weary her at last, [...] 70 [...] So {{that they find}} the goal or cease to feel [...] Further. Take comfort,--we shall find our boy.|$|E
6000|$|The coffee-room at the Blue Boar was empty, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> only ordered {{my dinner}} there, but had {{sat down to}} it, before the waiter knew me. As soon as he had apologized for the remissness of his memory, {{he asked me if}} he should send Boots for Mr. Pumblechook? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, you see, sir,' he replied, 'if he hadn't come in, {{the first}} time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been quite {{sure he was}} the thief, and would return, the time would have seemed long. But, as it was, I being dead certain of my man, the time seemed pretty short.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{about the}} cradles! That is imagination. My darling, it won't do. You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> {{been brought up}} to make {{ourselves}} happy on a very limited income." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'This day month! no, {{but this}} very day, Mr. M'Ruen--why, you got £18 from me when I {{received}} my last salary, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> a shilling back since.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me, gentlemen," [...] he said, [...] "but I do {{not think}} that Mr. Cawdor is in. He went out early this evening, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> heard him return." ...|$|R
