5|$|A {{contact angle}} less than 90° (low contact angle) usually {{indicates}} that wetting {{of the surface}} is very favorable, and the fluid will spread over <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>area</b> of the surface. Contact angles greater than 90° (high contact angle) generally means that wetting of the surface is unfavorable, so the fluid will minimize contact with the surface and form a compact liquid droplet.|$|E
5|$|But large {{bands of}} Alamanni, {{ignoring}} {{the threat posed}} by the Roman manoeuvre, invaded and ravaged the rich Rhone valley, even trying to take the major city of Lugdunum (Lyon) by assault. The attack was repulsed as the walls of the city proved too strong and the garrison, presumably limitanei troops, too valorous. Nevertheless, the Germans had devastated <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>area</b> and taken vast amounts of booty.|$|E

5|$|Gert {{was a large}} {{tropical}} cyclone {{for most of its}} lifespan; it always remained close enough to the coast to restrengthen and redevelop strong thunderstorms. In consequence, the storm produced heavy rainfall over <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>area,</b> causing extensive flooding and mudslides from Central America to Mexico. The disaster resulted in at least 116deaths and 16missing persons; damage to roads, property, crops and vegetation surmounted $170million.|$|E

The location of the IBA along the Allegheny Front also contributes to the diverse bird populations.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{power is}} the {{conversion}} of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>large</b> <b>area</b> of {{the grounds}} between the asylum main {{buildings}} and Princess Street was allocated to Children's Cottages in 1885. When the Children's Cottages became a separate institution, the area surrounding the cottages became no longer under asylum management and was no longer for asylum inmate use. Widening and straightening of Princess Street in 1939-1940 resulted in the demolishing of Kew's gatehouses, loss of land and the relocation of the main gates to Victoria Park, Kew. Construction of Yarra Boulevard during the 1930s led to {{a section of the}} asylum's river frontage being acquired by the roads department.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm warning was issued from Acapulco to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco at 2100UTC September 21, but was discontinued 18 hours later. On 0300 UTC September 12 a hurricane warning was issued for areas below La Paz. Twelve hours later, a {{tropical storm}} warning was issued for the remaining portion of Baja California Sur. The same day, a hurricane warning was issued for <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>area</b> of the mainland.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 29. It tracked slowly westward, and first showed signs of development two days later. On August 31, a second tropical wave exited the coast of Africa at a faster speed than its predecessor. The two waves interacted, and by September 2 combined to form <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>area</b> of disturbed weather across the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Convection increased within the system, and it developed a concentrated area of convection in conjunction with a well-defined low pressure area. By late on September 3, the system maintained a broad closed circulation and enough convective organization to be classified Tropical Depression Six while located about midway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa.|$|E
