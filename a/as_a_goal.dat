5|$|Following {{the arrival}} of Emmanuel Adebayor on loan, Benzema went unused in two {{consecutive}} league matches in February 2011. He returned to the starting lineup on 19 February and embarked on a run in which he scored ten goals in eight matches. Included in those ten goals were doubles in three straight matches against Málaga, Racing de Santander and Hércules, as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> in {{the first leg of}} Madrid's Round of 16 tie against former club Lyon. The strike against his hometown club was the 100th goal of his professional career, and also the first goal for Real Madrid at the Stade de Gerland in six years, though despite the honours associated with netting the goal, Benzema did not celebrate out of respect for his former club.|$|E
5|$|Burgmeier {{made his}} debut on 23 August, in a 2–1 defeat to Gillingham at The Darlington Arena. He scored his first goal for Darlington in a 2–1 win against Port Vale on 13 September. Manager Dave Penney praised Burgmeier {{for the start}} he made to the club, both <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> scorer and creator, which also helped him to play {{his way into the}} {{affections}} of the club's supporters. When Burgmeier won his 49thcap for Liechtenstein against Wales, it was his fourth in the two months since he joined Darlington. It took him past the club record three caps of Canadian Jason de Vos and New Zealander Adrian Webster, with a coach-load of Darlington fans there to see him play at the Millennium Stadium. His next cap clashed with Darlington's FA Cup first round replay with Conference North-side Droylsden, in which they were defeated.|$|E
5|$|Horse {{improvement}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>goal,</b> {{and horse}} breeding as an enterprise, date to medieval times; King John imported a hundred Flemish stallions, Edward III imported fifty Spanish stallions, and various priories and abbeys owned stud farms. Laws were passed restricting and prohibiting horse exports {{and for the}} culling of horses considered undesirable in type. By the 17th century, specific horse breeds were being recorded as suitable for specific purposes, and new horse-drawn agricultural machinery was being designed. Fast coaches pulled by teams of horses with Thoroughbred blood could make use of improved roads, and coaching inn proprietors owned hundreds of horses to support the trade. Steam power took {{over the role of}} horses in agriculture from the mid-19th century, but horses continued to be used in warfare for almost another 100 years, as their speed and agility over rough terrain remained unequalled. Working horses had all but disappeared from Britain by the 1980s, and today horses in Britain are kept almost wholly for recreational purposes.|$|E
5000|$|According to a {{study done}} by BYU professors, {{students}} at BYU feel marriage is a high priority. More specifically, 95% of BYU students rank [...] "marrying in the temple" [...] <b>as</b> <b>a</b> [...] "very important" [...] goal, second only to [...] "a close personal relationship with God". On the other hand, a survey of American High School Seniors showed that 78% of typical college age Americans rank marriage <b>as</b> <b>an</b> important <b>goal</b> in life. Similarly, Glenn and Marquardt report in their study that 83% of the women surveyed ranked marriage <b>as</b> <b>an</b> important <b>goal</b> in life. <b>As</b> a whole, students at BYU place a higher emphasis on marriage <b>as</b> <b>a</b> life <b>goal</b> than other college age Americans; however, across the board, college aged Americans place a considerably high emphasis on marriage <b>as</b> <b>a</b> life <b>goal.</b>|$|R

5|$|In the United States, initial {{support to}} develop {{alternative}} fuels {{by the government}} was also {{a response to the}} first oil crisis, and some time later, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> to improve air quality. Also, liquid fuels were preferred over gaseous fuels not only because they have a better volumetric energy density but also because they were the most compatible fuels with existing distribution systems and engines, thus avoiding a big departure from the existing technologies and taking advantage of the vehicle and the refueling infrastructure. California led the search of sustainable alternatives with interest focused in methanol. Ford Motor Company and other automakers responded to California's request for vehicles that run on methanol. In 1981, Ford delivered 40 dedicated methanol fuel (M100) Escorts to Los Angeles County, but only four refueling stations were installed. The biggest challenge in the development of alcohol vehicle technology was getting all of the fuel system materials compatible with the higher chemical reactivity of the fuel. Methanol was even more of a challenge than ethanol but much of the early experience gained with neat ethanol vehicle production in Brazil was transferable to methanol. The success of this small experimental fleet of M100s led California to request more of these vehicles, mainly for government fleets. In 1983, Ford built 582 M100 vehicles; 501 went to California, and the remaining to New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Russian armies entered Poland and Lithuania, {{starting}} the Polish–Russian War of 1792. The Sejm voted {{to increase the}} army of the Commonwealth to 100,000men, but owing to insufficient time and funds this number was never achieved and soon abandoned even <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>goal.</b> The Polish King and the reformers could field only a 37,000-man army, many of them untested recruits. This army, under the command of Józef Poniatowski and Tadeusz Kościuszko, defeated or fought to a draw the Russians on several occasions, but in the end, a defeat loomed inevitable. Despite Polish requests, Prussia refused to honor its alliance obligations. Stanisław August's attempts at negotiations with Russia proved futile. As the front lines kept shifting to the west and in July 1792 Warsaw was threatened with siege by the Russians, the King came to believe that victory was impossible against the numerically superior enemy, and that surrender was the only alternative to total defeat. Having received assurances from the Russian ambassador Yakov Bulgakov that no territorial changes will occur, the Guardians of the Laws cabinet voted 8:4 to surrender. On July 24, 1792, King Stanisław August Poniatowski joined the Targowica Confederation, as the Empress had demanded. The Polish Army disintegrated.|$|E
5|$|Tavares {{was born}} on September 20, 1990 in Mississauga, Ontario, to Barbara and Joe Tavares, who are of Polish and Portuguese descent, respectively. His {{maternal}} grandparents Bolesław and Josephine Kowal immigrated from Poland to Sudbury, Ontario, and his paternal grandparents Manuel and Dorotea Tavares immigrated from Portugal to Toronto, Ontario. At a very young age, Tavares moved to Oakville, Ontario. This is where he was first exposed to minor hockey via the Minor Oaks Hockey Association. Tavares also played soccer and lacrosse, and his highly competitive nature often led him to fight with other players. Tavares excelled at lacrosse, {{following in the footsteps}} of his uncle John Tavares, the all-time scoring leader in the National Lacrosse League (NLL), and was a ball boy for his uncle's NLL team, the Buffalo Bandits. The younger Tavares credits his uncle with teaching him the importance of remaining unselfish, stating that what he learned by following his uncle with the Bandits has made him better both as a person and a hockey player. Many skills he learned in lacrosse—such as spinning off checks and battling in traffic—transferred to ice hockey and improved Tavares' abilities <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> scorer.|$|E

25|$|Boyd is {{typically}} defined <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> poacher, whose key attribute is his strike rate.
