In the new production development paradigm, CAE simulation {{plays an important}} role because it models the entire casting process and reveals the dynamic behavior of the casting system in working conditions. In this research, Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) simulation was performed by using the simulation software (AnyCasting) in order to optimize casting design of an automobile part (Upper Oil Pan) which is well known and complicated to achieve a good casting layout. The simulation results were analyzed and compared carefully in order to apply them into the production die-casting mold.

5000|$|The {{workpiece}} travels down {{a conveyor}} belt towards a paint booth, or paint tank, where it is sprayed with, or dipped into, electrostatically charged paint particles. Integrated into a powder paint booth is a powder recovery unit, which recovers between 95% and 100% of the paint over-spray coatings. After the workpiece is coated, it continues on the conveyor belt to an oven, where the paint is cured. The benefits {{to the process of}} electrostatic coating is the ability to recover the little over-spray and having the process automated which will cut costs. The reason for the little over spray is the paint particles that do not hit the piece will turn in the air {{and go back to the}} piece. There are also some drawbacks to the process: everything in the area of the coating must be grounded to prevent static buildup and can easily arc, damaging the hanging devices and/or the locations where the hanging devices rest on the conveyor. All hangers, conveyors, etc. must be cleaned often to ensure a good ground and prevent anyone in the area from getting a severe shock. In an airborne system, any recesses on the piece that is being coated can be missed because the electrostatic paint is more attracted to corners and sharp edges; this means that another process for coating can be a better option if the piece has recesses. In the dipping process, <b>air</b> <b>entrapment</b> can occur in blind holes and deep recesses, so the positioning of the part as it enters the paint tank is critical in removing any trapped air that will restrict paint coverage.|$|E

This investigation has devised new, replicable techniques to position and manipulate air in kiln-formed glass, termed collectively as Kiln-controlled Precision <b>Air</b> <b>Entrapment.</b> As a result of the inquiry, complex assemblages of text and figurative imagery have been produced that allow the articulation of expressive ideas using air voids, which were not previously possible. The research establishes several new innovations for air-entrapment in glass, as well as forming a technical hypotheses and a practice-based methodology. The research focuses primarily on float glass and the application of CNC abrasive waterjet cutting technology; incorporating computer aided design and fabrication alongside more conventional glass-forming methods. The 3 -axis CNC abrasive waterjet cutting process offers accuracy of cut and complexity of form and scale, across a flat plane of sheet glass. The new method of cleanly fusing layered, waterjet-cut float glass permits the fabrication of artwork containing <b>air</b> <b>entrapment</b> as multilayered, intricate groupings and composite three-dimensional void forms. Kiln-controlled <b>air</b> <b>entrapment</b> presents a number of significant advantages over conventional glassblowing techniques of <b>air</b> <b>entrapment</b> which are based around the decorative vessel or solid spheroid shaped on the blowing iron.

The risk of defects is increased when the mold contains depressions or when the resist is deposited as droplets rather than spin-coated, which allows air to be trapped easily [10], which results in the need to conduct the imprinting process under vacuum to prevent trapping of air bubbles as observed in [5, 8, 21].

40|$|AbstractThe {{reliable}} {{evaluation of}} moisture transfer in building materials is often {{crucial for the}} correct design of new structures or for the remediation of defective existing ones. An important condition in this respect is the accurate description of moisture storage and transport phenomena in building materials. Unfortunately, we are facing a dichotomy on that front, {{in relation to the}} over-capil- lary moisture range, more particularly the difference between capillary and saturated moisture content and the slow second phase in capillary absorption experiments. The widely accepted <b>air</b> <b>entrapment</b> paradigm explains these by presuming that air remains partially trapped in the pore system, escaping via dissolution into and diffusion through the pore water. The Delphin-adopted low capillarity approach on the other hand attributes these to low capillary forces counteracted by gravity in large pores. We therefore execute a series of measurements specifically targeting <b>air</b> <b>entrapment</b> versus low capillarity. In the first series, ca- pillary absorption tests are performed with water contact respectively at the bottom and the top surface of the sample, thus chang- ing the relative direction of gravity. The two variants should respectively give similar and unlike results in the <b>air</b> <b>entrapment</b> pa- radigm and low capillarity approach. In the second series, capillary absorption measurements are conducted at normal and reduc- ed air pressure, thus modifying the air content of the pore space. In the <b>air</b> <b>entrapment</b> paradigm and low capillarity approach res- pectively, the two variants should give rise to differing and matching results. Our experiments all demonstrate the validity of the widely accepted <b>air</b> <b>entrapment</b> paradigm, hence invalidating the Delphin-adopted low capillarity approach...|$|E

40|$|As the {{development}} of microelectronics is still driving towards further miniaturization, Flip Chip technology has been widely accepted as a means for. maximum miniaturization with additional advantages. These are shortest interconnect length for minimum signal disturbance and simultaneous interconnection leading to reduced process times especially for high I/O counts and for RF applications. Flip Chip technology allows for reliabilities required for automotive applications, but to achieve this goal, a plastic encapsulant, the so called underfiller, has to be used. Conventionally a liquid epoxy resin is dispensed near the Flip Chip and is driven by capillary action under the chip. New material developments for transfer molding allow now underfilling and overmolding in one single transfer molding step. Existing standard equipment for encapsulation can be used and no additional process step for underfill dispensing is required. Molded Flip Chips have the potential of high reliability as the low CTE of the flip chip molding compound reduces the thermal mismatch. State of the art in FC molding is the encapsulation of Single Chip Packages as BGA or CSP. Trends of the market driving at SIPs with an integration of different devices as e. g. SMD and FC. Therefore the high reliable encapsulation of these hybrid packages with inhomogeneous topography is the future goal. For the qualification of Flip Chip Molding a test vehicle has been designed at Fraunhofer IZM. This test vehicle for process evaluation allows the encapsulation and underfilling of a single flip chip. Process development is described {{with a focus on}} Flip Chip and SIP molding challenges.

40|$|Liquid drops play a {{dominant}} role in numerous industrial applications, such as spray coating, spray painting, inkjet printing, lithography processes, and spraying/sprinkling in agriculture or gardening. In {{all of these}} examples, the generation, flight, impact, and spreading of drops are separate stages of the corresponding industrial processes, which are all thoroughly studied for many years. This thesis focuses on drop dynamics, impact phenomena, Leidenfrost drops, and pouring flows. Based on extensive analysis and numerical results, various mechanisms by which drops can deform are resolved in detail, in both fundamental and industrial contexts. The title of the thesis, Dynamics of Deforming Drops, can be explained in two ways. Drops can be deformed and moving drops can deform another liquid surface. Large {{part of the study}} focuses on the small scale deformations of the liquid surface(s) {{at the bottom of the}} impacting drop/object, induced by the force exerted by the gas that is squeezed out between the falling object and the bottom surface. This can result in small <b>air</b> bubble <b>entrapment,</b> which is generally undesired in applications. The results of interferometry experiments and Boundary Integral simulations show that there exists a maximal entrained bubble size for some impact velocity. The mechanism of small <b>air</b> bubble <b>entrapment</b> applies for impact of a liquid drop onto a solid surface, impact of a liquid drop onto a (deep) pool, and impact of a solid sphere onto a pool. Other covered subjects are the high-speed impact of a train of microdrops on a pool, instabilities at Leidenfrost drops, drop deformation induced by the impact of a picosecond laser-pulse, and pouring flows. The study of the response of drops impacted by a focused laser pulse is motivated by Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which is used for the creation of nanometer-sized patterns on electronic chips in, for example, mobile phones. To print the features at high resolution, one needs high energy radiation. In EUV-machines this radiation results from liquid tin sheets that are impacted by a laser-pulse, resulting in the formation of plasma. The fluid dynamics play a crucial role for improving the efficiency of the EUV machine...|$|R

These pumps are used in ships to extract water in case of water leakage into the ship. The pump is used to remove the air and the water inside the ship is entrained out by the suction of the pump.

This study aims to investigate the effect of temperature and <b>air</b> <b>entrapment</b> on water infiltration at the basin scale by conducting successive infiltration cycles in an experimental basin of 11869 m 2 in a pumping field at Crepieux-Charmy (Lyon, France).

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{described}} {{a new approach}} to design, fabricate, package and test three silicon based porous vertical structures for nanoparticle separations. These vertical structures stand in between two microfluidic channels. In these walls nano channels that connect the two adjacent microchannels are embedded. Fluid and small particles can penetrate the walls through the embedded nano channels while particles larger than the nano channels size will be stopped. This configuration allows particle separation with in-plane fluid flow. For a uniform and repeatable pore size, conventional silicon micromachining technology is employed to realize these structures. We use the thickness of precisely dimensioned sacrificial layers to accurately define the nanometer thick size of the pores or channels which are later formed by removing the sacrificial material by isotropic etching. Three particle separation devices are designed, fabricated and tested. The first design, based on a surface micromachining process, is more suitable for devices aimed at small flow rates. The process is simple and also suitable for non-silicon substrates. The major limitation of this design is the difficulty encountered in adapting it to high flow rate applications. The second design, based on a bulk micromachining process, overcomes the limitations experienced with the first one. It is in fact more suitable for silicon based lab-on-a-chip particle separation devices with the need for higher flow rates. The major limitation found in this design is the nanochannels may deform under high fluid pressure due to the cantilever-shape of the beams separating two nanochannels. The last design, buried bulk micromachined design, is more suitable for lab-on-a-chip devices with sensors integrated in the particle separation devices. With a membrane covering the microchannels, sensors can be directly placed above the separation devices before encapsulation. Moreover, this design is more robust as the beams are doubly supported beam structures and can withstand a significantly higher flow pressure. The nanochannels are formed by wet chemical etch and the nanofluidic devices operates under wet conditions. A drying step is therefore necessary for conventional encapsulation processes, such as wafer bonding or CVD thin film encapsulation. This drying step will likely cause stiction and <b>air</b> bubble <b>entrapment</b> problems. To avoid those problems, a new encapsulation process based on low temperature lamination of TMMF S 2030 Dry Film Resist, is developed. This process allows the encapsulation of nanofluidic devices while water can be kept inside the etched nanochannels. By eliminating the final drying step, stiction or air bubbles formation can be avoided. ECTM/DIMESElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R

This paper presents a numerical study of two-phase flow over a sloping bottom {{with the presence of}} breaking waves. The details of the numerical model, an improved Volume Of Fluid (iVOF) method, are presented in the paper The program has been developed initially to study the sloshing of liquid fuel in satellites. This micro-gravity environment requires a very accurate and robust description of the free surface. Later, the numerical model has been used for calculations of green water loading and the analysis of anti-roll and sloshing tanks, including the coupling with ship motions. The model has been extended recently to take two-phase flow effects into account. Two-phase flow effects are particularly important near the free surface, where loads on offshore structures strongly depend on the interaction between different phases like <b>air</b> and water <b>Entrapment</b> of <b>air</b> pockets and entraininent of bubble clouds have a cushioning effect on breaking wave impacts. The velocity field around the interface of air and water, being continuous across the free surface, requires special attention. B using a newly-developed gravity-consistent discretisation, By spurious velocities at the free surface are prevented. Thus far, the second air phase has been treated as incompressible. Taking compressibility effects into account requires a pressure-density relation for grid cells containing air. The expansion and compression of air pockets is considered as an adiabatic process. The numerical model is validated on several test cases. In this paper special attention will be paid to the impact of a breaking wave over a sloping bottom...|$|R
