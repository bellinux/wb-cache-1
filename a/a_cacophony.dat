Frog choruses are overwhelming; during alligator mating season the grunts of bulls join in. The marshes around the St. Johns River upper basin teem with birds. A recent study counted 60,000 birds in one month, nesting or feeding in the upper basin. Wading and water birds like the white ibis (Eudocimus albus), wood stork (Mycteria americana), and purple gallinule (Porphyrio martinicus) depend on the water for raising their young: they prey upon small fish and tadpoles in shallow water and puddles in the dry season.

40|$|Drosophila Frequenin (Frq) and its {{mammalian}} and worm homologue, NCS- 1, are Ca 2 +-binding proteins {{involved in}} neurotransmission. Using site-specific recombination in Drosophila, we created two deletions that removed the entire frq 1 gene {{and part of}} the frq 2 gene, resulting in no detectable Frq protein. Frq-null mutants were viable, but had defects in larval locomotion, deficient synaptic transmission, impaired Ca 2 + entry and enhanced nerve-terminal growth. The impaired Ca 2 + entry was sufficient to account for reduced neurotransmitter release. We hypothesized that Frq either modulates Ca 2 + channels, or that it regulates the PI 4 Kβ pathway as described in other organisms. To determine whether Frq interacts with PI 4 K. with consequent effects on Ca 2 + channels, we first characterized a PI 4 Kβ-null mutant and found that PI 4 Kβ was dispensable for synaptic transmission and nerve-terminal growth. Frq gain-of-function phenotypes remained present in a PI 4 Kβ-null background. We conclude that the effects of Frq are not due to an interaction with PI 4 Kβ. Using flies that were trans-heterozygous for a null frq allele and <b>a</b> null <b>cacophony</b> (encoding the α 1 -subunit of voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels) allele, we show a synergistic effect between these proteins in neurotransmitter release. Gain-of-function Frq phenotypes were rescued by <b>a</b> hypomorphic <b>cacophony</b> mutation. Overall, Frq modulates Ca 2 + entry through a functional interaction with the voltage-gated Ca 2 +-channel subunit; this interaction regulates neurotransmission and nerveterminal growth.

In their 2014 Guide to London's Contemporary Architecture, Kenneth Allinson and Victoria Thornton wrote that [...] "Some see this building as Farrell's most controlled and mature building – a rich diet, certainly, but not <b>a</b> <b>cacophony</b> of rhetorical features, nor without the unselfconscious virtuosity which can uplift and excite. But it is undoubtedly too Gotham City for the taste of many. Farrell's many critics and opponents...would call it a nightmare: a secret service fortress, provided by a private speculator, designed by an avowed populist, and sited on a most prominent river location.

500|$|The album opens {{out with}} 'Howl', a grinding, but graceful opener. The song starts with an opening {{two minutes of}} intense and spacious drone synthesisers. The {{following}} two minutes of the song break into [...] "unrelenting and brutal" [...] mathcore with Eva Spence making her vocal debut with her [...] "gleefully guttural vocal register". The song is used {{as an example of}} how the band is using more complex, but 'more rewarding' song structures in their music. ‘Ex Luna Scientia’, the opening single for the album is seen as a more expansive and more melodic song in comparison to their previous work, placing emphasis on Eva Spence’s singing rather than her trademark 'guttural' style. Rock Sound reviewer Oliver Robertson used the song as an example for the sonic development of the album as it is [...] "more focused on making each element stand out now, rather than creating simply <b>a</b> <b>cacophony</b> of noise." [...] The introduction to 'Empiresk' is seen as being [...] "completely caked in reverb" [...] and ends with a stoner riff. The [...] "sparse piano chords" [...] that open both 'Empiresk' and 'Prelude II', among the atmospheric breaks that are featured on other tracks on the album defy the aggression featured on the rest of Astraea. Songs like 'The Scales of Balance', 'Remancer' and 'Gloam' are seen as having a fimiliar style to the Rolo Tomassi's previous work. 'Gloam', specifically the last half of the song, showcases a [...] "battle between melodic keyboard and screamed vocals with a real sense of urgency and threat." [...] 'Remancer' specifically has been considered as almost like Mastodon. The album closes with 'Illuminare', a song which Metal Hammer reviewer Merlin Alderslade cites as showing Radiohead and Sigur Rós influences.|$|E

To appease his interested co-workers, Jim fabricates numerous details of his jury duty, and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) becomes suspicious when Jim mistakenly refers to a food truck franchise Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) ate at during his jury duty as a [...] "restaurant". Dwight accuses Jim of lying about jury duty and extracts from Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) a promise to fire Jim if he proves he is correct. Ashamed, Jim privately admits his guilt to Andy, who insists that they keep the matter a secret so that he will not be held to his promise to fire Jim. However, Dwight increases his attempts to prove Jim's guilt, and Jim finally decides to defy Andy's orders and tell his co-workers the truth rather than wait for Dwight to inevitably expose him. While this angers most of the employees, Dwight is thrilled at the confession and demands that Andy keep his promise to fire Jim. Andy refuses, so Dwight tries to contact Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). To smooth things over, Jim and Pam bring in their children, CeCe and Phillip, to present pictures that CeCe drew for the co-workers. It becomes clear that Jim and Pam drew the pictures themselves, but before the members of the office can berate the couple, the children begin crying loudly, creating <b>a</b> <b>cacophony</b> that Jim and Pam struggle to control, forcing them to take them back to the car.
