5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel that because you are black {{you will never be}} treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm not going to let him change my life.|$|E

Witness Fallehy wrote that he saw Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday shooting <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who was using a horse to barricade himself, and once shot the man fell. In his statement, Fallehy wrote that the man still held his pistol in his hand. Although he did not see him shoot, he thought Tom McLaury was armed.|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} what happens, {{consider the following}} analogy. Someone throws one ball every second <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> Assume that balls travel with constant velocity. If the thrower is stationary, the man will receive one ball every second. However, if the thrower is moving towards the man, he will receive balls more frequently because the balls will be less spaced out. The inverse is true if the thrower is {{moving away from the}} man. So it is actually the wavelength which is affected; as a consequence, the received frequency is also affected. It may also be said that the velocity of the wave remains constant whereas wavelength changes; hence frequency also changes.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave a mixed review, {{giving the}} film {{three out of}} four stars despite {{complaining}} that the film [...] "recycles a plot that was already old when Tracy and Hepburn were trying it out". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was very critical of the film, calling it insipid. He wrote, [...] "Anne Fletcher directs Peter Chiarelli's script like a manufacturer of hard plastic that is guaranteed to ward off intrusion from all recognizable human emotion." [...] New York Times writer Manohla Dargis felt that Bullock's character was awkward in comparison to her previous work. She continued: [...] "She’s always been better in fundamentally independent roles that allow her to grab the wheel [...] and take the spotlight , an independence that persists {{all the way through the}} last-act coupling. She can smile as brightly <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> as well as the next leading lady, though, like all genuinely big female stars, she’s really more of a solo act." [...] The Telegraph Tim Robey expressed disappointment towards the film, giving it a two out of five stars.|$|E

Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone described the song as [...] "diva house music", going on to commend the tracks instrumental and Banks' vocal surge. In a later Rolling Stone article, Jon Blistein said that the song balanced an [...] "eclectic" [...] mix of influences, from Banks' fast rapping technique over the electronic-inspired beat to the [...] "pop-diva" [...] hook she performs on top of house production. Colin Stutz from Billboard described the song as a [...] "hook heavy pseudo-sung track that rides the line with hip-hop and pop over some crisp house production", going on to label the track as seapunk. Elias Leight, also from Billboard, described the song's production as a mix of hip-hop, pop and dance beats, going on to describe how the track boldly shifts in genres throughout its duration, and that the track could be aimed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> or her former labels. Consequence of Sounds Dusty Henry noted that Banks [...] "spends {{most of the time}} showing off her singing chops by wailing over booming, dance club beats".|$|E
2500|$|... "In {{my young}} days... I had been {{attracted}} {{to the idea of}} pure creativity, taking the form of abstract art.... I derived ideas for my abstract studies from life around me. I would look <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> a house, a plant, at intricate machinery, extravagant shadowscapes on walls or ceilings, at quivering bonfire flames, and would compose them into abstract pictures, creating in my imagination visions that were not like actual reality.... Fortunately I soon realised that it was not given to me, a human being, to create from 'nothing', in the way only God can create. I realised that everything that I created was conditioned by what was already in existence. I could not invent a new colour or line that had never existed anywhere before. An abstract picture is like a string of words, beautiful and sonorous in themselves, perhaps, but never expressing a complete thought..."—Preface to St Silouan the Athonite ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] was filmed in Santa Barbara, California, in July 2010, and was {{directed}} by Yoann Lemoine.

She commented about the filming on her Twitter, saying, [...] "That's a wrap for Teenage Dream! So gorgeous [...] In my hometown. I got to cast all my friends in the new music vid for Teenage Dream = amazing insanity." [...] The video features images of Perry {{in a car with}} a boyfriend, then, Perry is shown in a Party with her friends, and the closing scene shows Perry kissing her boyfriend under the water. Perry was interviewed online via YouTube, where she talked about the music video. She said: [...] "It is gonna be completely different from 'California Gurls.' With 'Teenage Dream' you'll see a very raw, almost vulnerable ..... I had to wear so many less layers of makeup. I had to make out with a boy which was very traumatizing, I was kind of mean to him.
