5|$|Richard Nixon: The Shaping of His Character was {{published}} in late 1981 and received reviews less enthusiastic than any of her earlier books. Writing in The New Republic, Godfrey Hodgson questioned both her psychoanalytic approach and her motives: “e <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> of having the insights of psychotherapy used {{as a tool for}} character destruction, certainly for libel, potentially for revenge.” Sales of the book were disappointing, {{in part because of the}} reviews, in part because memoirs by Nixon associates such as Henry Kissinger, John Ehrlichman, and John Dean had recently flooded the market. Perhaps Brodie’s book was most influential in stimulating Oliver Stone to create his controversial 1995 movie Nixon.|$|E

5|$|A {{different}} call is {{emitted by}} a male frog or unreceptive female when mounted by another male. This is a distinct chirruping sound and {{is accompanied by a}} vibration of the body. Tree frogs and some non-aquatic species have a rain call that they make on the basis of humidity cues prior to a shower. Many species also have a territorial call that is used to drive away other males. All of these calls are emitted with the mouth of the frog closed. A distress call, emitted by some frogs when they <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger,</b> is produced with the mouth open resulting in a higher-pitched call. It is typically used when the frog has been grabbed by a predator and may serve to distract or disorientate the attacker so that it releases the frog.|$|E

5|$|Two {{species of}} birds in the park <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> of disappearing. The range of the Cape Sable seaside sparrow is {{restricted}} to Everglades National Park and the Big Cypress Swamp. In 1981 6,656 Cape Sable seaside sparrows were reported in park boundaries, but surveys over 10 years documented a decline to an estimated 2,624 birds by 2002. Attempts to return natural levels of water to the park have been controversial; Cape Sable seaside sparrows nest about a foot off the ground, and rising water levels may harm future populations, as well as threaten the endangered snail kite. The Everglades snail kite eats apple snails almost exclusively, and the Everglades is the only location in the United States where this bird of prey exists. There {{is some evidence that}} the population may be increasing, but loss of habitat and food sources keep the estimated number of these birds at several hundred.|$|E
