40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the clinical efficacy {{and safety of}} a transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) with N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) {{for the treatment of}} <b>arterial</b> esophageal <b>bleeding.</b> Materials and Methods: Between August 2000 and April 2008, five patients diagnosed with <b>arterial</b> esophageal <b>bleeding</b> by conventional angiography, CTangiography or endoscopy, underwent a TAE with NBCA. We mixed NBCA with iodized oil at ratios of 1 : 1 to 1 : 4 to supply radiopacity and achieve a proper polymerization time. After embolization, we evaluated the angiographic and clinical success, recurrent bleeding, and procedure-related complications. Results: The bleeding esophageal artery directly originated from the aorta in four patients and from the left inferior phrenic artery in one patient. Although four patients had an underlying coagulopathy {{at the time of the}} TAE, angiographic and clinical success was achieved in all five patients. In addition, no procedurerelated complications such as esophageal infarction were observed during this study. Conclusion: NBCA can be an effective and feasible embolic agent in patients with active <b>arterial</b> esophageal <b>bleeding,</b> even with pre-existing coagulopathy.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Postoperative spinal {{extradural}} hematomas are rare. Most of {{the cases}} that have been reported occured within 3 days of surgery. Their occurrence in a delayed form, that is, more than 72 hours after surgery, is very rare. This case is being reported to enhance awareness of delayed postoperative spinal extradural hematomas. Case presentation We report a case of acute onset dorsal spinal extradural hematoma from a paraspinal muscular <b>arterial</b> <b>bleed,</b> producing paraplegia 72 hours following surgery for excision of a spinal cord tumor at T 8 level. The triggering mechanism was an episode of violent twisting movement by the patient. Fresh blood in the postoperative drain tube provided suspicion of this complication. Emergency evacuation of the clot helped in regaining normal motor and sensory function. The need to avoid straining of the paraspinal muscles in the postoperative period is emphasized. Conclusion Most cases of postoperative spinal extradural hematomas occur {{as a result of}} venous <b>bleeding.</b> However, an <b>arterial</b> source of <b>bleeding</b> from paraspinal muscular branches causing extradural hematoma and subsequent neurological deficit is underreported. Undue straining of paraspinal muscles in the postoperative period after major spinal surgery should be avoided for at least a few days. </p...|$|R

Narrowed AVD with normal or elevated CI occurred in 11 of 20 patients studied. AVD correlated inversely with CI. In the dog given E. coli endotoxin, there was marked widening of the AVD and decrease in cardiac output. In patients with septic shock and dogs with endotoxic shock, <b>arterial</b> <b>bleed</b> lactate correlated inversely with V 02 but did not correlate with pC 02. In 5 patients with hypoxemia and septic shock, oxygen therapy did not improve V 02. These findings in patients with septic shock imply cellular damage or arteriovenous shunting. In the dog with endotoxin shock, decreased V 02 is due to inadequate blood flow...|$|R

However, the pathologist had suggested the possibility that the ulceration and consequent haemorrhage had resulted from a pill (which might have been taken because of malarial symptoms) lodging in the diverticulum; but, even if this suggestion were correct, the link between malaria and the observed causes of death would be entirely indirect.|$|R
40|$|Main {{findings}} We {{describe the}} use of a novel endoscopic approach in the management of unremitting gross hematuria following post-percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) in a 65 -years-old male. This approach proved successful and cost-effective in managing haemorrhage post-PCNL when renal angiography failed to localize the source of bleeding. Case hypothesis The recommended treatment modality for renal calculi &# 8805; 2 cm is PCNL. It is essential that clinicians are aware of the various complications that can arise from PCNL, including arteriovenous fistula, which is typically managed with renal angio-embolization. The development of a renal arteriopelvic fistula (APF) is an extremely rare complication, and accounts of haemorrhage from renal APF and its treatment have not been well-described in the literature. We successfully hypothesized that the ureteroscopic localization, fulguration, and closure with a fibrin sealant {{at the site of the}} <b>arterial</b> <b>bleed</b> results in optimal treatment for this clinical presentation. We report this case in detail. Promising Future Implications The successful and cost-effective endoscopic approach described here for treatment of post-PCNL renal APF and unremitting gross hematuria ought to be considered as an adjunct to renal angiography and embolization when the source of bleeding cannot be accurately identified using traditional imaging modalities...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Aldosterone {{seems to}} {{influence}} the haemostatic system by several mechanisms and to {{increase the risk of}} thrombosis. The objective of this meta-analysis was {{to assess the impact of}} inhibition of the mineralocorticoid receptor due to the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) on venous and <b>arterial</b> thrombosis, <b>bleeding</b> events and mortality. Materials and methods: We systematically searched PubMed and EMBASE through August 1, 2014, without language restrictions. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that tested the effect of MRAs versus active control/no treatment and reported data on thrombotic or bleeding events or mortality in patients with common causes of secondary hyperaldosteronism were included. Results: 20 published RCTs reported in 19 papers for a total of 17, 610 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, all reported data on mortality, 15 on cardiovascular mortality, 14 on thrombotic events and 12 reported data on bleeding events. No RCTs investigated patients with primary hyperaldosteronism. 19 RCTs were performed in patients with hypertension and heart failure. In general, the heterogeneity was low. No differences were observed in <b>arterial</b> thrombotic and <b>bleeding</b> events. Patients treated with MRAs had 20 % lower odds of total mortality and 23 % of cardiovascular mortality compared with controls (odds ratio (OR) 0. 80, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 73 - 0. 87 and OR 0. 77, 95 % CI 0. 70 - 0. 85, respectively). Conclusion: Inhibition of the mineralocorticoid receptor with MRAs in patients with hypertension and heart failure does not change the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and bleeding events. Our meta-analysis confirms the favourable effects of MRAs on total and cardiovascular mortality. These data suggest that MRAs can be considered as safe regarding their effects on haemostasis in patients with hypertension and heart failure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2000 Since the {{invention}} of the stethoscope, detection of vibrations and sounds from the body has been a touchstone of diagnosis. However, the method is limited to sounds transmitted to the skin with no means to determine the anatomic and physiological source of the sounds save the cunning of the examiner. To aid diagnosis, researchers have attempted to correlate the characteristics of the sounds to the type and significance of the disorder, and they have sought to understand the mechanisms that generate the vibrations producing the sound. Despite three decades of research these goals have met limited success. Important obstacles have been the inability to non-invasively and efficiently (1) detect the vibrations and (2) fully measure the vibration characteristics. This document introduces an extension to current techniques of detecting and measuring arterial vibrations. Using ultrasound quadrature phase (complex) demodulation methods similar to those of ultrasonic color flow imaging, we have developed a system to detect and measure tissue vibrations with amplitude excursions as small as 30 nanometers. Morlet wavelet analysis, combined with non-parametric binary hypothesis testing, permits sensitive and specific detection and measurement of short duration vibrations amidst clutter and time-varying, colored noise. Specifically, the wavelet spectra will consist of Gaussian noise under the null hypothesis that vibration and blood flow are absent. Determination of the presence of vibration is then based on the expected distributions of the novel normalized wavelet power spectra or normalized cross wavelet spectra associated with the Gaussian noise, as derived in this document. Receiver operating curves for the detector were generated from simulated vibrations. These curves reveal expected detection rates in excess of 99. 5 % at false alarm rates below 1 % for signal to noise ratios as small as 0. 5. Subsequent to detection, the Morlet wavelet is also used for characterizing the detected vibration. Vibrations and their quantified characteristics are displayed on conventional ultrasound images to aid the clinician's diagnosis. The detector and estimator have been successfully applied to phantom (physical model) and in vivo vibrations. A few examples are shown, including an <b>arterial</b> <b>bleed.</b> The current system is offline, though a real-time implementation will be straightforward...|$|R
