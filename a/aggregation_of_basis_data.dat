The schemes we discuss are fuzzy logic, hidden Markov models, Bayesian networks, and Dempster-Schafer theory of evidence. The paper also presents a conceptual architecture and identifies the suitable scheme to be employed by each component of the architecture. As a proof-of-concept, we will introduce the architecture we implemented to model various places on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> from temperature, light intensity and relative humidity sensors...|$|R
