5|$|In each level, {{the player}} may come <b>across</b> <b>one</b> other player {{temporarily}} connected to their game. When players approach each other they charge one another's scarves. They cannot {{communicate with each}} other beyond patterns of singing. Players can help each other by activating strips of cloth or showing paths, but cannot hinder each other and are not necessary for completing any level. When two players finish a section {{at the same time they}} remain together into the next one; otherwise they are connected to new players when they move on. While all of the figures generally look the same, without distinguishing characteristics, individual players can be told apart by unique symbols which are shown floating in the air when they sing and are displayed on their robes at all times. The entire game takes about two to three hours to complete.|$|E
5|$|The five episodes, each of {{approximately}} twenty minutes, were broadcast <b>across</b> <b>one</b> week from 4 to 8 March 1996, {{as part of}} The Fifties season of programming. The serial was promoted in listings magazine Radio Times with an article by Kneale about Quatermass and his opinion of other science fiction programmes. Episode one was transmitted at 10.32pm on the Monday (originally scheduled for 10.05pm but delayed by a live concert broadcast beforehand); episode two at 9.30pm on the Tuesday; episode three 9.00pm on Wednesday, episode four 10.15pm on Thursday and episode five at 9.40pm on the Friday. The production was made and transmitted in stereo. It was Andrew Keir's final professional performance; he died the following year.|$|E

5|$|In 737, Asad {{launched}} a campaign into the principality of Khuttal, whose rulers had supported the Turgesh and Harith's rebellion. Asad was initially successful, but the Khuttalan regent, Ibn al-Sa'iji, called upon the Turgesh for aid. While the Muslim army was scattered pillaging, the Turgesh khagan Suluk brought his army, allegedly 50,000 strong, from his capital Tokmok into Khuttal within 17 days. Ibn al-Sa'iji, who tried to play both sides off against each other, informed Asad of the Turgesh expedition only shortly before its arrival. Asad had time enough to send ahead his heavy baggage train, laden with the plunder and captives from Khuttal, back south {{under the command of}} Ibrahim ibn Asim al-'Uqayli, accompanied by the contingent from the allied principality of al-Saghaniyan. Asad with the main Muslim army remained behind, but at the arrival of the Turgesh host, Asad's troops broke into a headlong flight for the Oxus, which they managed to reach just ahead of the Turgesh. The crossing of the river was a confused affair, as Asad ordered each of his soldiers to carry <b>across</b> <b>one</b> of the sheep the army had brought with it as provisions. In the end, the sheep had to be abandoned as the pursuing Turgesh attacked the Arab rearguard, composed of the Azdi and Tamimi tribal contingents, on the north bank. As the rear guard was thrown back, Asad's army hurried to cross the river in panic.|$|E

Collin Kuhn stole three bases in the loss. The Razorbacks would exact revenge the following day, scoring twenty one runs. Bo Bigham went 3 for 5 with 4 RBI, with home runs coming from Collin Kuhn and Zack Cox. Seven Razorbacks had 2+ hits, and six posted one or more RBI.|$|E

25|$|One morning, Harold finds Elsie {{sitting on}} a log in the woods, crying {{about the state of}} her life.

Her husband has arrived at the hotel {{unexpectedly}} and is in a terrible rage. At that moment, Philip Clayton runs in. He is carrying a spanner and screams at Elsie, accusing her of having an affair just as one of the Polish women had told him. He chases Elsie out of Harold's room and back to her own. Harold runs after him and is in time to see Elsie throw a paperweight at her husband in self-defence. He falls to the ground and Elsie begs Harold to leave them before he gets himself into trouble. Half an hour later, Mrs Rice joins Harold and tells him that Philip is dead, killed by the blow.|$|E
25|$|India {{began their}} innings poorly. Steve Waugh, with runs to work with, {{attacked}} {{from the beginning}} {{with as many as}} 7 men catching. Opener Sadagoppan Ramesh duly obliged to Jason Gillespie, edging one to Ponting in the slips without a single run on the board. Shiv Sunder Das and Rahul Dravid played out the remainder of the session to take India to 32/1 at tea. The final session again would prove the most dramatic, as India then collapsed from a cautious 34/1 to 113/8. Wickets fell regularly as Das was soon followed by the celebrated Indian middle order. Tendulkar played <b>across</b> <b>one</b> from McGrath and was adjudged lbw, Dravid lost his stumps to Warne and Ganguly was snapped up brilliantly by Steve Waugh at gully. India ended Day 2 on 128/8 with the two Hydrabadis VVS Laxman and Venkatapathy Raju at the crease, still needing 118 more to avoid the follow-on. India had lost 7 wickets in a session like the Australians the previous day and Australia looked odds-on favourites to extend their winning streak to 17.|$|E
