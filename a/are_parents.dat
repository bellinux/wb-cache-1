25|$|The United States Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), {{as amended}} by The Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003, defines {{child abuse and neglect}} as, at minimum: any recent act or failure to act {{on the part of a}} parent or caretaker, which results in death, serious {{physical}} or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation; or an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm.

500|$|Screenwriter Michael Arndt {{initially}} {{worked for}} {{a year on the}} film's script, calling it [...] "both a brilliantly creative idea but also incredibly challenging," [...] but left the project in early 2011, adding that [...] "knowing the Pixar process, there may not be a single word [...] that remains in the final script! They've had writers work on it since then." [...] Josh Cooley and Meg LeFauve were credited as co-writers of the screenplay following their contributions during the rewrite. Like Docter, Cooley and LeFauve included experiences with raising their own children into the screenplay. Cooley said [...] "... we treated the emotions like parents for Riley and because {{all of us in the}} writing room <b>are</b> <b>parents</b> ourselves, we just reflected on our own experiences as parents to create the characters."

500|$|The final part of {{the book}} {{suggests}} that most people have three significant moves: when leaving their parents' home, when starting a family, and when retiring (or when their own adult children move out). When young people leave their home (or when they complete college), they tend to locate to areas that offer attractive job markets, cultural or recreational amenities, and rank high in quality of life factors. When they get married or have children, people choose areas that are perceived as safe and family-friendly. Florida suggests using a [...] "Trick-or-Treater Index" [...] to gauge if parents feel safe allowing their children to go door-to-door on Halloween. [...] He also cites Catherine Austin Fitts' [...] "Popsicle Index", which gauges how far <b>are</b> <b>parents</b> willing to allow their children to walk to buy a treat. Once retired, or when their adult children move away, people tend to gravitate towards similar areas as young people, if it is close to their grandchildren, but in quieter neighborhoods that provide opportunities for hobbies or for a second career.|$|E

[...] Pope pointed out that the season [...] "remains the high point for the series" [...] as it had produced [...] "classic" [...] episodes such as [...] "No Weenies Allowed", [...] "SpongeBob Meets the Strangler", and [...] "Krusty Krab Training Video". However, Pope described [...] "The Lost Episode" [...] as a [...] "misstep" [...] that [...] "veers too far away from Bikini Bottom and into unfunny live-action territory." [...] Furthermore, various celebrities—including Justin Timberlake, Kelly Osbourne, Britney Spears, Bruce Willis, Noel Gallagher, rapper Dr. Dre, and Mike Myers—were reported to be fans of the show. American actor Rob Lowe said, [...] "You've got to love a sponge in tightie whities." [...] In 2002, fans of the show formed a [...] "new religion"—the Church of SpongeBob SquarePants. The organization has more than 700 members. Its manifesto said it wanted to push [...] "simple things like having fun and using your imagination", and even offered study courses on the show. A Nickelodeon spokesman said [...] "SpongeBob's appeal is extraordinary." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Buddha placed much {{importance}} on {{the cultivation of}} good will and compassion towards one's parents, spouse, friends and all other beings. Buddhism strongly values harmony {{in the family and}} community. Keeping the five precepts and having a generous attitude (Dana) is seen as the foundation for this harmony. An important text, seen as the lay people's Vinaya (code of conduct) is the Sigalovada Sutta which outlines wrong action and warns against the squandering of wealth. The Sigalovada Sutta outlines how a virtuous person [...] "worships the six directions" [...] which <b>are</b> <b>parents</b> (East), teachers (South), wife (West), and friends and colleagues (North), and the two vertical directions as: ascetics and Brahmins (Up) and the Servants (Down). The text elaborates on how to respect and support them, and how in turn the Six will return the kindness and support. The relationships are based on reciprocation, and it is understood one has no right to expect behavior from others unless one also performs good acts in their favor.|$|E
