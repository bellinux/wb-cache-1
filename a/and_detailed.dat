5|$|Ahimsa {{does not}} merely {{indicate}} absence of physical violence, but also indicates absence of desire {{to indulge in}} any sort of violence.

5|$|As {{technology}} improved, {{measurement of}} depth, {{latitude and longitude}} became more precise and it became possible to collect more or less continuous sets of data points. This allowed researchers to draw accurate <b>and</b> <b>detailed</b> maps of {{large areas of the}} ocean floor. Use of a continuously recording fathometer enabled Tolstoy & Ewing in the summer of 1947 to identify and describe the first abyssal plain. This plain, south of Newfoundland, is now known as the Sohm Abyssal Plain. Following this discovery many other examples were found in all the oceans.|$|E

As part of their research for the open world, the developers conducted field research around New York throughout development and captured footage for the design team.|$|E

5|$|Her {{essays on}} Pushkin and Poem Without a Hero, her longest work, were only {{published}} after her death.

It gives a deep <b>and</b> <b>detailed</b> analysis of her epoch and her approach to it, including her important encounter with Isaiah Berlin (1909–97) in 1945. Her talent in composition and translation is evidenced in her fine translations of the works of poets writing in French, English, Italian, Armenian, and Korean.|$|E

On 17 August, Hindenburg pledged to provide Bulgaria with support once the situation on other front permits it. Hindenburg's reluctance to support Bulgaria was also manifested by the early September redeployment of the last German Jäger battalion stationed in Macedonia back into Germany.|$|E
