40|$|Abstract: We have {{investigated}} conformational properties of a linear semiflexible homopolymer chain in the bulk and <b>adsorption</b> <b>desorption</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{in the presence}} of an attractive impenetrable curved surface using lattice models. Since, it is understood that the essential physics associated with the conformational behavior of such polymer chains can be derived from a model of a self avoiding walk (SAW) or directed self avoiding walk (DSAW) on a suitable lattice. Therefore, DSAW model on a two dimensional hexagonal lattice has been solved analytically to study the phase transitions occurring in the semiflexible polymer chain. We have found that the persistent length of the polymer chain is independent of its bending energy and its value is found to be unity for directed walk models for hexagonal lattice. Results obtained in presence of an attractive impenetrable curved surface show that adsorption of stiffer polymer chains take place at a smaller value of monomer surface attraction than the flexible polymer chains in the case when adsorbed parts of the polymer chain do not contribute Boltzmann weight to partition function of the polymer chain due to bending of the polymer chain. However, when adsorbed parts of the semiflexible polymer chain contribute Boltzmann weight due to bending of the polymer chain, critical value of monomer surface attraction required for adsorption of the polymer chain on curved impenetrable surface is found to be independent of bending energy of the semiflexible polymer chain.

One dimensional stair shaped line imposes geometrical constrain on the chain. Lattice model of fully directed self avoiding walk is used to model the chain, semiflexibility of the chain is accounted by introducing energy barrier for each bend of the chain. Exact expression of the partition function of the chain is obtained using generating function technique for the cases, viz. (i) constrained copolymer chain is in the bulk, (ii) constrained copolymer chain interacting with an impenetrable flat surface, (iii) constrained copolymer chain interacting with constraint itself and (iv) general expression of the partition function of the copolymer chain, interacting with a flat surface and geometrical constraint (stair shaped line).

40|$|The {{effects of}} various {{parameters}} influencing the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions oc'curring during the adsorption process of ferritin onto Au or PS- PFEMS (polystyrene-block-poly(ferroceny 1 ethylmethylsilane)) nanopatterned diblock copolymer surfaces have been investigated. The effects of pH {{change of the}} buffering media and applied potential change have been studied in-situ on the Au surface. The influence of a chemically nanopatterned surface and the change of ionic strength have been investigated by ex-situ methods. For ex-situ measurements an AFM (atomic force microscope) and for in-situ measurements an EQCM (electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance) were used. Sudden changes in the pH of the buffering solution enabled control over the amount of ferritin adsorbed on the Au surface. More reliable control over adsorption was achieved by controlling the potential applied to the Au surface. By changing the applied potential the electrostatic and hydrophobic properties are changed simultaneously, in-situ. Under the conditions studied, the electrostatic forces had greater influence on the <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> <b>behaviour</b> of ferritin than the hydrophobic interactions. To investigate the effect of potential control on the nanoscale, ex-situ AFM measurements were made. These measurements supported the data gained by EQCM. Furthermore they showed {{that there is no}} observable ordering during adsorption. Comparison of the <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> <b>behaviour</b> of ferritin monomers, dimers and agglomerates controlled by potential change showed that our technique is sensitive enough to distinguish among them.. The dependence of the affinity of adsorption of ferritin on the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions made it possible to try to pattern ferritin {{with the help of a}} chemically patterned surface. It has been shown that there is preference of adsorption to one of the blocks, and that this can be influenced by controlling the pH and ionic strength.

This study examines the <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> <b>behaviour</b> of mercury (Hg) and mercury(II) chloride (HgCl_ 2) on coke. For that purpose coke samples were loaded with Hg and (HgCl_ 2) in a laboratory facility. Additional to untreated coke, sulphuric acid impregnated coke was used too. The examinations of desorption were conveyed through thermal analysis and mass spectrometry. The adsorption quality of the coke for mercury species is strongly increased by impregnation with sulphuric acid. The desorption of Hg begins at 150 C.

Little {{is known about}} the interaction dynamics of organic acid anions with the soil matrix and the potential impact of <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> processes on the functional significance of these effects. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize experimentally the <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> dynamics of organic acid anions in five agricultural soils differing in iron and aluminium oxide contents and using citrate as a model carboxylate. Results showed that both <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> processes were fast in all soils, reaching a steady state within approximately 1 hour. However, for a given total soil citrate concentration (ct) the steady state was critically dependent on the starting conditions of the experiment, whether most of the citrate was initially present in solution (cl) or held on the solid phase (cs). Specifically, desorption-led processes resulted in significantly smaller steady-state solution concentrations than adsorption-led processes, indicating that hysteresis occurred. As it is not possible to distinguish between different <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> pools in soil experimentally, a new dynamic hysteresis model that relies only on measured soil solution concentrations was developed. The model satisfactorily explained experimental data and was able to predict dynamic <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> <b>behaviour.</b> To demonstrate its use, we applied the model to two relevant situations involving exudation and microbial degradation. The study highlighted the complex nature of citrate <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> dynamics in soil.

From {{the analysis of}} the polarised adsorption bands it is concluded that the adsorbates are ordered in the molecular sieves at 373 K. The orientation of molecules interacting with Brönsted or Lewis acid sites and of physisorbed molecules are discussed. Benzene adsorbed at Brönsted sites is oriented with the aromatic ring parallel to the crystallographic c-axis of the molecular sieve, whereas physisorbed benzene is oriented with the aromatic ring parallel to the crystallographic a,bplane. Acetonitrile can adsorb on top of the Brönsted sites, resulting in an orientation with the CN-axis in the a,bplane. Physisorbed acetonitrile has the CN-axis parallel to the c-axis.

The prelayers were prepared by adsorption of the ampholytic diblock copolymer poly(methacrylic acid) -block-poly ((dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) (PMAA-b-PDMAEMA). This polyampholyte adsorbs in densely packed micelles directly from aqueous solution. Ellipsometry was used to determine the amount of adsorbed polyampholyte and protein. While ATR-IR spectroscopy gives information about the <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the preadsorbed polyampholytic layer, the lateral structures of the dried films were investigated by scanning force microscopy (SFM). The amount of protein adsorbed was found to be strongly influenced by the preadsorbed polyampholyte compared to the adsorption on the pure silicon substrates. No displacement of the polyampholyte by the proteins was detected. In most cases the protein adsorption was reduced by the preadsorbed polyampholytic layer. The observed trends are explained by the change in electrostatic and hydrophilic characteristics of the substrates. Furthermore, the entropy of adsorption has to be taken into account.

The aim of this study therefore was to experimentally characterize the <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> dynamics of organic acid anions in different soils using citrate as a model carboxylate. Results showed that both <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> processes were fast, reaching a steady state equilibrium solution concentration within approximately 1 hour.

Specifically, desorption-led processes resulted in significantly lower equilibrium solution concentrations than adsorption led processes indicating time-dependent sorption hysteresis. As it is not possible to experimentally distinguish between different sorption pools in soil (i. e. fast, slow, irreversible adsorption/desorption), a new dynamic hysteresis model was developed that relies only on measured soil solution concentrations.

The kinetics of coal reject pyrolysis and structural changes of coal reject as well as activation of coal reject chars are studied by both experiment and modelling. It is demonstrated that coal reject {{can be converted to}} effective adsorbents for NO(x) and SO 2 removal. A two-consecutive-reaction model developed in this work can well describe the pyrolysis kinetics and confirm the softening effect on pore structure development during carbonization of coal reject.

However, proper interpretation of the adsorption data from integrated experiments can be problematic using classical adsorption theories. In this work, it has been demonstrated that the experimental observations can be better understood in the light of mean-field DFT simulations of adsorption in representative pore models. Hence, a better description of the particular physical mechanisms underlying adsorption isotherms in disordered porous solids has been obtained.

The column operates at 160 °C with 1 -decanol as sample solvent and mobile phase. We have now tested this HPLC system for separations of random propene/ 1 -alkene and ethylene/ 1 -hexene copolymers: While copolymers of propene with 1 -butene, 1 -hexene and 1 -octene copolymers eluted in size exclusion mode without adsorption, propene/ 1 -octadecene and ethylene/ 1 -hexene copolymers are strongly retained and eluted only after application of a linear gradient starting from 1 -decanol and ending with pure 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene. The retention of propene/ 1 -alkene (> 11 carbons in the side chain) copolymers increases with the concentration of comonomer, making this HPLC system suitable to separate these copolymers according to their chemical composition. In contrast, the retention of ethylene/ 1 -hexene samples decreases with increasing 1 -hexene content. Branching in this case shortens the length of continuous methylene sequences of the polymer backbone, which are expected to adsorb in a planar conformation to the graphite layers.

Notwithstanding, they can also act as a sink for airborne pollutants and excess moisture through adsorption. In this paper, we evaluate the ability of Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF) modified with walnut shell to regulate RH, toluene, limonene, dodecane and formaldehyde. The physicochemical properties, including molecular size/shape, vapour pressure, polarity and boiling point of VOCs allowed them to represent a range of pollutants. <b>Adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> <b>behaviour</b> of MDF containing up to 15 % walnut shell was evaluated in 2 -L environmental chambers under dynamic conditions at 23 °C and 50 % RH. The porous microstructure of the MDF and walnut shell and their chemical composition were analysed using SEM, XRD and FTIR. Compared to a control panel, walnut shell additions showed an improved ability to remove VOCs and formaldehyde from the indoor air and buffer humidity. Of particular significance was the irreversible sink effect of formaldehyde and dodecane. This was attributed to the porous surface of walnut shell increasing the specific surface area of the panel and thus its adsorption capacity. The improved capacity of buffer humidity also increased the ability to adsorb water soluble VOCs such as formaldehyde. This research provides for the first time significant evidence that walnut shell modified MDF can improve indoor air quality...|$|R

It {{was found that the}} equilibrium moisture content and mechanical properties were highly dependent on relative humidity suggesting that material properties may vary during use. The BET and Flory–Huggins equations gave the best fit for <b>desorption</b> and <b>adsorption,</b> respectively, but a significant difference was observed between <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> <b>behaviour</b> below a water activity of 0. 6, which was thought to be due to changes in intermolecular interactions. The monolayer adsorption capacity (0. 05 g/g) was unaffected by the TEG content, using the BET sorption isotherm. The water activity required to form a monolayer (awl) was also independent of the amount of TEG, but was different for <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> (about 0. 5 and 0. 2, respectively). Increasing TEG did not have a strong influence on the equilibrium moisture content, especially at low water activity. Dynamic mechanical analysis revealed that the glass transition temperature decreased almost linearly with increasing water activity, ranging between 3 and 85 ℃, however, above a water activity of 0. 6 a second transition was observed, most likely due to phase separation. Depending of TEG content, tensile strength increased from about 10 to 15 MPa at a water activity of 0. 4, where after a drastic decrease was observed. A similar trend was observed for elongation at break. At low water activity (below 0. 4) elongation was less than 3 %, increasing between 30 and 50 % at higher water activities.

Central to this is the recognition that physical and chemical processes occurring at the surfaces of interstellar grains are crucially important. Grains provide catalytic surfaces upon which a variety of reactions occur that are crucial to the chemical evolution of molecular clouds. They provide surfaces onto which gaseous molecules may condense and when irradiated by photons and cosmic rays are the chemical nanofactories in which the complex molecules of life may be synthesised from simple ices. Of course, the key to this chemistry is an appreciation {{of the role of the}} <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> of atoms and molecules from the grains themselves, under both reactive and non reactive conditions. It is with this insight that we have developed an interdisciplinary programme that brings together laboratory surface science with molecular astrophysics and astronomy in researching aspects of such interactions in our laboratory. As part of this programme, we have developed a unique apparatus that is capable of investigating such chemistry under conditions of temperature and pressure that mimic those of the interstellar medium.

40|$|The particle-solution (Kd) {{relationships}} of Pu(III,IV) in the Esk Estuary are investigated, using new experimental data {{together with a}} synthesis of our earlier work. Adsorption of 236 Pu(IV) by a suspension of intertidal mud (40 mg L− 1) from the Esk Estuary was determined after 1 h, {{as a function of}} salinity and pH, in a series of controlled laboratory experiments. Desorption of 239, 240 Pu(III,IV) from this environmentally contaminated sediment was determined concurrently. The short term (i. e., within a tidal cycle) non-conservative behaviour of Pu(III,IV) in both the laboratory experiments and the estuary appears to be dominated by a rapid, reversible surface complexation reaction, although only a small fraction (< 5 %) of the 239, 240 Pu(III,IV) activity of the environmentally contaminated sediment is able to participate in the reaction. The existence of this exchangeable or labile fraction can explain the apparent dependence of Pu(III,IV) Kd on sediment concentration. Thus, a single Kd value is able to describe both the observed <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> <b>behaviour</b> and the effect of sediment concentration, when desorption is expressed with respect to the labile 239, 240 Pu(III,IV) fraction. For example, in R. Esk water, the adsorption of 236 Pu(III,IV) and the desorption of 236, 240 Pu(III,IV), over a two order of magnitude concentration range of unwashed Esk Estuary sediment, can be accounted for by a single Kd of 3 × 103 L kg− 1. The Kd for the labile Pu(III,IV) fraction varies mainly as a function of salinity. pH is not an important factor over the pH range 4 – 9, although H+ ion exchange does occur, probably through a similar surface complexation reaction.

40|$|A {{study on}} the <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> <b>behaviour</b> of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D), 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4, 5 -T), 2 -methyl- 4 -chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), 2, 4 -dichlorophenol (2, 4 -DCP), 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol (2, 4, 5 -TCP) and para-chloro-ortho-cresol (PGOC), found in high {{concentrations}} in a New Zealand landfill. Volcanic soil with an organic matter content of 8. 7 % was used as adsorbent. Results of studies to determine the equilibrium sorption behaviour for each chemical showed the adsorption data for both phenoxyacetic acids and chlorophenols could be described by a Freundlich-type isotherm equation, the adsorption capacity followed the order: 2, 4, 5 -T > MCPA > 2, 4 -D > 2, 4, 5 -TCP > PCOC > 2, 4 -DCP at all pH and temperature values. Sorption capacity decreased with increasing pH and temperature; the heat of adsorption values indicating chemicals were adsorbed either by physical or hydrogen bonding to the soil surface. Results show only 2 - 4 % of the total surface was occupied indicating chemical adsorption to specific sites present in the soil organic matter. The desorption results indicate isotherm parameters were dependent {{on the amount of}} each chemical adsorbed onto the soil. A linear relationship was developed to obtain the desorption parameters from the <b>adsorption</b> isotherm parameters. <b>Desorption</b> experimental results reveal that all the solutes adsorbed could not be desorbed, indicating a fraction of the chemical was resistant to desorption. A modified Freundlich-type equation described the competitive equilibrium <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> of 2, 4 -D-MCPA, 2, 4 -D-PCOC and MCPA-PCOC mixtures. The model incorporated competition coefficients and was found to fit measured data, satisfactorily. The competition coefficients were linearly related to the initial concentration of the solutes in case of adsorption, and on the amount of chemical adsorbed for desorption. The results showed that the adsorption capacity of each solute decreased by about 8 - 12 % in presence of the other competing solutes. However, in case of MCPA, the capacity decreased by 31 % in the presence of 2, 4 -D. The desorption results reveal that 2, 4 -D and MCPA desorbed to a lesser extent in the bicomponent system compared to the corresponding single solute system. Similarly, the desorption of PCOC was less in the presence of 2, 4 -D than of MCPA compared to single solute system. A spinning basket reactor determined the kinetics of sorption for phenoxyacetic acids and chlorophenols. The film-mass transfer coefficients determined from the initial uptake rate data for the first 45 seconds, while the surface diffusion coefficients were obtained by fitting the experimental results with a homogeneous surface diffusion model solution. The desorption diffusion coefficients were found to be of the same order of magnitude as those of adsorption diffusion coefficients. The bicomponent surface diffusion coefficients were found to be slightly smaller (less than 10 %) than single solute surface diffusion coefficients and this was due to competition between the solutes. A surface diffusion model based on equilibrium sorption, film-mass transfer and surface diffusion coefficient along with dispersion was used to predict the soil column data. All the parameters in the model were determined from independent experiments or calculated from literature correlations. The results from the column studies indicate that an increase in the concentration and flow rate resulted in the solutes moving faster in the column. A significant tailing of the chemical was observed at low concentrations for all the solutes. The results indicate that sorption played a dominant role in the transport of chemicals in columns. The breakthrough and elution for phenoxyacetic acids was in the order 2, 4 -D > MCPA > 2, 4, 5 -T. For chlorophenols the order was: 2, 4 -DCP > PCOC > 2, 4, 5 -TCP. The HSDM also used to predict the <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> of bicomponent mixtures and the results indicated that the breakthrough and elution occurred earlier than in single solute systems. The order of breakthrough and elution was PCOC > 2, 4 -D > MCPA. To conclude, this thesis presents a detailed investigation of the <b>adsorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> characteristics of phenoxyacetic acids and chlorophenols for single and dual component systems in a volcanic soil. This study has identified the mechanisms and processes responsible for the leaching of the chemicals and can be used in remediation of a contaminated soil...|$|R
