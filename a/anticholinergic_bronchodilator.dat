Areas covered: Safety data from recently published clinical trials, which compared tiotropium with placebo or an active control, were reviewed. Trials included children, adolescents, and adults across severities of symptomatic asthma, and assessed tiotropium delivered via the Respimat and HandiHaler devices.

40|$|Inhaled {{anticholinergic}} bronchodilators are a {{treatment of choice}} for {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Tiotropium is currently the only long-acting inhaled <b>anticholinergic</b> <b>bronchodilator</b> available and works by selectively inhibiting muscarinic receptors involved in mucus hypersecretion and bronchoconstriction, two characteristic features of COPD. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of tiotropium across all degrees of severity of stable COPD. Tiotropium improves airway function, symptoms of dyspnoea, exercise endurance and health status. Treatment with tiotropium also reduces acute exacerbations associated with COPD as well as associated hospitalisations. The clinical improvements observed with tiotropium are associated with changes in airway volume, particularly inspiratory capacity, which translate into improvements in patient-centred outcomes, such as breathlessness during exercise. Emerging evidence indicates that tiotropium may exert additive effects when used in combination with the long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA), formoterol, consistent with the current recommendations for combination therapy in patients who do not respond to a single bronchodilator. Encouraging results have also been obtained with tiotropium in triple combination with salmeterol/ fluticasone propionate. Furthermore, post hoc analyses suggest that tiotropium may slow the rate of decline in lung function characteristic of COPD. Recent studies indicate that combining tiotropium therapy with pulmonary rehabilitation programmes can yield significant improvements in exercise endurance time. In safety evaluations, tiotropium was generally well tolerated with a similar safety profile to ipratropium, a short-acting <b>anticholinergic</b> <b>bronchodilator.</b> Dry mouth is the most common adverse event reported with tiotropium, although this is generally transient and does not lead to treatment discontinuation. © 2008 CSF Medical Communications Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Bronchodilators, {{generally}} administered via metered dose or {{dry powder}} inhalers, are the mainstays of pharmacological treatment of stable COPD. Inhaled long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) and <b>anticholinergics</b> are the <b>bronchodilators</b> primarily {{used in the}} chronic treatment of COPD. Anticholinergics act as muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists and are frequently preferred over betaagonists for their minimal cardiac stimulatory effects and greater efficacy in most studies. Their therapeutic efficacy {{is based on the}} fact that vagally mediated bronchoconstriction is the major reversible component of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD. However, bronchodilators are effective only on the reversible component of airflow obstruction, which by definition is limited, as COPD is characterized by a fixed or poorly reversible airflow obstruction. Inhaled anticholinergic antimuscarinic drugs approved for the treatment of COPD include ipratropium bromide, oxitropium bromide and tiotropium bromide. Ipratropium bromide, the prototype of <b>anticholinergic</b> <b>bronchodilators,</b> is a short-acting agent. Oxitropium bromide is administered twice a day. Tiotropium bromide, the only long-acting antimuscarinic agent (LAMA) currently approved, is administered once a day.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which quaternized <b>anticholinergic</b> <b>bronchodilators</b> permeate the airway epithelium remains controversial to date.

Unexpectedly, a higher transepithelial permeability was observed in the secretory direction, with an apparent efflux ratio > 4. Concentration-dependent and inhibitor studies demonstrated the drug intracellular uptake was carrier-mediated. Interestingly, monitoring drug release post cell loading revealed the presence of an efficient efflux system on the apical side of the cell layers. Acting in concert, apical transporters seem to promote the ‘luminal recycling’ of the drug and hence, limit its transcellular transport. The data are in agreement with an apical Organic Cation Transporter (OCT) being involved in this process but also suggest the participation of unknown uptake and efflux transporters sensitive to probenecid. This study suggests the absorption of ipratropium across the pulmonary barrier is primarily governed by paracellular passive diffusion but transporters might {{play a significant role in}} controlling the drug local concentrations in the lungs...|$|R

Airway absorption of these cationic drugs is incompletely understood. We examined carrier-mediated mechanisms of cationic drug uptake by human airway epithelia. Airway tissues and epithelial cells, obtained from lung donors without preexisting lung disease, were evaluated for organic cation transporter expression by quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence. For in vitro functional studies on primary airway epithelial cells, uptake of the cationic fluorophore 4 -[4 -(dimethylamino) -styryl]-N-methylpyridinium (ASP+) was characterized. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated high mRNA levels for two polyspecific organic cation/carnitine transporters, OCTN 1 and OCTN 2, in human airway epithelia. Immunofluorescence of human airway sections confirmed OCTN 1 / 2 protein expression, with a predominant localization to the apical portion of epithelial cells. Primary airway epithelial cells showed a carrier-mediated, temperature-sensitive and saturable uptake of ASP+. Seventy-five to eighty percent of ASP+ uptake was inhibited by L-carnitine, an OCTN 2 -carried zwitterion. The uptake was pH dependent, with ∼ 3 -fold lower rates at acidic (pH 5. 7) than at alkaline (pH 8. 2) extracellular pH.

Its role in asthma treatment has been recently investigated. This review critically evaluates documented evidence of clinical trials and assesses the therapeutic implications of anticholinergic drugs in asthma management. So far, the results of 10 Phases II and III randomized controlled trials, with a duration of 4 to 52 weeks, evaluating the effect of adding tiotropium to the treatment of mild, moderate, or severe asthma, have been published. These trials involved 3368 subjects with moderate asthma and 1019 subjects with severe asthma. Also, 1 systematic review and 6 meta-analyses have appraised the results of published and unpublished trials investigating the role of tiotropium in asthma. The results of the trials in mild to moderate asthma showed that adding tiotropium to inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) was not inferior to adding long-acting beta(2) -agonists (LABAs). In addition, the safety and efficacy of tiotropium were similar to those of salmeterol. The results of studies on severe asthma showed that adding tiotropium to a treatment with high doses of an ICS plus LABA results in further improvement in lung function, increases the time to the first severe exacerbation of asthma and to worsening of asthma, and improves asthma control. Except for dry mouth, the safety profile of tiotropium was similar to placebo both in moderate and in severe asthma. Adding tiotropium to an ICS or ICS plus LABA improves lung function, symptoms, and asthma control, and in severe asthma, it increases the time to exacerbations, with good safety profile.

This thesis describes the use of ultrasonically nebulized distilled water (UNOW) to induce cough in man. Investigation of the chemosensitivity of this response identified that extremes of pH, a chloride concentration below 75 mmol/l, but not changes in osmolarity induce cough which reflects afferent rapidly adapting recep or sensitivity in animal studies. Inhaled beta-adrenergic and <b>anticholinergic</b> <b>bronchodilators,</b> which inhibit cough in asthma, markedly reduced UNOW-induced cough in both healthy and asthmatic volunteers. Bronchoconstriction with inhaled leukotriene 04, which constricts both asthmatic and non-asthmatic airways, also caused coughing. Inhibition of bronchoconstriction either specifically or non-specifically resulted in inhibition of cough. Nedocromil sodium and the diuretic, frusemide, but not the commonly prescribed opiate, codeine, exhibited antitussive activity. Cough was also induced by inhalation of the C-fibre stimulants, capsaicin and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), which was characterised by studies of adaptation, cross-adaptation and antitussives. UNOW and PGE 2, but not capsaicin, exhibited rapid adaptation of cough. Crossadaptation, however, did not occur suggesting distinct mechanisms of cough mediation. Nedocromil inhibited capsaicin-induced cough but not PGE 2 -induced cough, while fenoterol did not affect either challenge. Oxitropium, which inhibited UNOW-induced cough, did not reduce cough associated with upper respiratory tract infection. Cough can be induced {{by a variety of}} inhaled stimuli.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate whether pharmacotherapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPI), inhaled corticosteroids, and atypical antipsychotics was associated with the increased risk for CAP in hospitalized older adults with the adjustment of known risk factors (such as smoking status and serum albumin levels). Methods A retrospective case-control study of adults aged 65 years or older at a rural community hospital during 2004 and 2006 was conducted. Cases (N = 194) were those with radiographic evidence of pneumonia on admission. The controls were patients without the discharge diagnosis of pneumonia or acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (N = 952). Patients with gastric tube feeding, ventilator support, requiring hemodialysis, metastatic diseases or active lung cancers were excluded. Results Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the current use of inhaled corticosteroids (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2. 89, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 56 - 5. 35) and atypical antipsychotics (AOR = 2. 26, 95 % CI = 1. 23 - 4. 15) was an independent risk factor for CAP after adjusting for confounders, including age, serum albumin levels, sex, smoking status, a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and COPD, the current use of PPI, β 2 agonist and <b>anticholinergic</b> <b>bronchodilators,</b> antibiotic(s), iron supplement, narcotics, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The crude OR and the AOR of PPI use for CAP was 1. 41 [95 % CI = 1. 03 - 1. 93] and 1. 18 [95 % CI = 0. 80 - 1. 74] after adjusting for the above confounders, respectively. Lower serum albumin levels independently increased the risk of CAP 1. 89 - fold by decreasing a gram per deciliter (AOR = 2. 89, 95 % CI = 2. 01 - 4. 16). Conclusion Our study reaffirmed that the use of inhaled corticosteroids and atypical antipsychotics was both associated with an increased risk for CAP in hospitalized older adults of a rural community. No association was found between current PPI use and the risk for CAP in this patient population of our study. </p...|$|R
40|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is the third}} {{leading cause of death}} worldwide. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are important events in the natural history of this condition because they negatively impact health status, rate of hospitalization, disease progression, and mortality. Viral and/or bacterial infections are the main cause of exacerbations. The treatments include systemic corticosteroids, <b>bronchodilators,</b> <b>anticholinergics</b> and/or short- or long-acting β 2 -agonists, and antibiotics in case of bacterial infections. In some cases, oxygen-therapy is indicated. This article focuses on several aspects of AECOPD, including epidemiology, diagnostic approach, i. e. investigations and management of AECOPD...|$|R
