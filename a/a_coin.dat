5|$|The Norse-American medal is not <b>a</b> <b>coin,</b> and is {{not legal}} tender. Due to its {{similarity}} to <b>a</b> <b>coin,</b> {{and the fact that}} it was authorized by Congress, it is sometimes collected as part of the U.S. commemorative coin series. Though the silver ones can be purchased for less than $100 up to $500, and the silver-plated one for between $500 and $3,500, the gold specimen has sold for as high as $40,000. Some medals were used as pocket pieces or worn in mountings to the fair, and display damage or wear.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Central Bank of Armenia issued 50-dram {{banknotes}} depicting Khachaturian's portrait and the Yerevan Opera Theater on the obverse and {{an episode}} from the ballet Gayane and Mount Ararat on the reverse.

5|$|In 2003, Affeldt {{found himself}} {{competing}} with Runelvys Hernández {{for the first}} spot in the Royals' starting rotation during Spring training. Because Tony Peña, the Royals' manager, was unable to decide which one would be the ace, he flipped <b>a</b> <b>coin</b> to determine who would be number one. Hernández won the toss.|$|E
5|$|The Alabama Centennial half dollar, or Alabama half dollar, was a {{commemorative}} fifty-cent coin {{struck by}} the United States Bureau of the Mint in 1921 as a belated acknowledgement of the 100th anniversary of Alabama's admission to the Union in 1819. The coin was created by Laura Gardin Fraser, who {{became the first woman}} designer of <b>a</b> <b>coin.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Benfica {{were stopped}} in the quarter-finals by Ajax, after a replay in Paris.

5|$|The {{game was}} {{necessary}} after both teams finished {{the season with}} identical win–loss records of 88–74. The White Sox won <b>a</b> <b>coin</b> flip {{late in the season}} which, by rule, awarded them home field in the game. The tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular season game by both teams, with all events in the game added to regular season statistics.|$|E
5|$|A sale of 1,000 coins {{was made}} to an {{executive}} of the Hudson's Bay Company, and they {{were placed in the}} Archives of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. They were stolen in 1982 by a caretaker, who spent them and redeemed some for Canadian currency at a bank. Many wound {{up in the hands of}} <b>a</b> <b>coin</b> dealer, who sold them widely. At the time, the coins were worth about US$800 each. Once the theft was realized, the Province of Manitoba filed suit to recover the remaining coins, but a settlement allowed the dealer to retain them.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal faced {{cup holders}} Liverpool {{at home in}} the {{following}} round. A solitary goal scored by Bergkamp in the 27th minute saw the home side progress in a match layered with controversy: Martin Keown, Bergkamp and Liverpool's Jamie Carragher were all sent off in the space of ten minutes, the latter for hurling back <b>a</b> <b>coin</b> at the crowd. Against Gillingham in the fifth round, Arsenal twice had their lead cancelled out, before Tony Adams scored the winning goal of the match.|$|E

5|$|As both Manchester United and Bayern Munich {{traditionally}} wore red {{as their}} primary kit colour, UEFA regulations would normally have required both teams to wear their change kits. However, the two clubs felt {{it would have been}} a shame for neither to wear their traditional colours, and they agreed to toss <b>a</b> <b>coin</b> to see who would have first choice. Manchester United won the toss and therefore wore their usual European colours of red shirts, white shorts and white socks, while Bayern wore silver shirts, shorts and socks, all with maroon trim.|$|E
5|$|Aurelian's {{attempt to}} reform the {{currency}} had failed; the denarius was dead. Diocletian restored the three-metal coinage and issued better quality pieces. The new system consisted of five coins: the aureus/solidus, a gold coin weighing, like its predecessors, one-sixtieth of a pound; the argenteus, <b>a</b> <b>coin</b> weighing one ninety-sixth of a pound and containing ninety-five percent pure silver; the follis, {{sometimes referred to as}} the laureatus A, which is a copper coin with added silver struck at the rate of thirty-two to the pound; the radiatus, a small copper coin struck at the rate of 108 to the pound, with no added silver; and <b>a</b> <b>coin</b> known today as the laureatus B, a smaller copper coin struck at the rate of 192 to the pound. Since the nominal values of these new issues were lower than their intrinsic worth as metals, the state was minting these coins at a loss. This practice could be sustained only by requisitioning precious metals from private citizens in exchange for state-minted coin (of a far lower value than the price of the precious metals requisitioned).|$|E
5|$|Dinefwr Park has {{a history}} of {{occupation}} spanning at least two millennia. A polished stone axe dated to the Neolithic period was unearthed on the site in 1976, and during the Iron Age, a farm existed on the property. The Romans later built a pair of forts here, with one partly overlying the other. There are traces of Roman roads and tracks, some of which may {{have been part of the}} Carmarthen–Llandovery Roman road. A Roman milestone and <b>a</b> <b>coin</b> hoard were unearthed near Dinefwr Castle, and pieces of amphorae and Samian items have been excavated near Dinefwr Farm.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, {{after the}} Rockets won <b>a</b> <b>coin</b> toss against the Baltimore Bullets to {{determine}} who would have the first overall pick in the 1968 NBA Draft, they selected Elvin Hayes from the University of Houston. Hayes led the team to the franchise's first ever playoff appearance in 1969, but the Rockets lost in the semi-finals of the Western Division to the Atlanta Hawks, four games to two. In 1970 NBA Draft, the Rockets drafted Calvin Murphy and Rudy Tomjanovich, who would both spend their whole careers with the Rockets.|$|E
5|$|In 215 Caracalla {{introduced}} the antoninianus, <b>a</b> <b>coin</b> intended {{to serve as}} a double denarius. This new currency, however, had a silver purity of about 52% for the period between 215 and 217 and an actual size ratio of 1antoninianus to 1.5denarii. This in effect made the antoninianus equal to about 1.5denarii. The reduced silver purity of the coins caused people to hoard the old coins that had higher silver content, making the inflation problem caused by the earlier devaluation of the denarii worse than it had been before.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, {{commemorative}} coins were {{increasing in}} value, and Cincinnati businessman Thomas G. Melish, <b>a</b> <b>coin</b> collector, lobbied Congress to authorize several new issues, {{of which he}} would be the sole distributor. He was successful with the Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar, from which he profited greatly, and with the Cleveland piece. Brenda Putnam designed the Cleveland coin, which was approved by the Commission of Fine Arts after suggestions by sculptor Lee Lawrie.|$|E

5|$|Most {{bronze and}} silver coins have mainly {{been found in}} Aksum territory, with very few pieces found in Judea, Meroë and Egypt.

5|$|On 28 February 2011, MLS {{announced}} that for their qualification, United would play the Philadelphia Union in a play-in game for U.S. Open Cup qualification.

The match will be played 6 April 2011 at the Maryland SoccerPlex. United hosts the Union due to winning <b>a</b> <b>coin</b> flip. The winner of the D.C.-Philadelphia match will host New England Revolution in the second phase of MLS qualification. That match is expected to be played in late April 2011.|$|E
