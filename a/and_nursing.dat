(1) Background: Health systems researchers are beginning to address nurses’ workload demands at different unit, job and task levels; {{and the types of}} administrative interventions needed for specific workload demands. (2) Methods: This was a cross-sectional correlational study of 472 acute care nurses from British Columbia, Canada. The workload factors included nurse reports of unit-level RN staffing levels and patient acuity and patient dependency; job-level nurse perceptions of heavy workloads, nursing tasks left undone and compromised standards; and task-level interruptions to work flow. Patient outcomes were nurse-reported frequencies of medication errors, patient falls and urinary tract infections; <b>and</b> <b>nurse</b> outcomes were emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction. (3) Results: Job-level perceptions of heavy workloads and task-level interruptions had significant direct effects on patient <b>and</b> <b>nurse</b> outcomes. Tasks left undone mediated the relationships between heavy workloads <b>and</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>and</b> patient outcomes; and between interruptions <b>and</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>and</b> patient outcomes.

Thematic {{analysis was used to}} generate key themes from the interviews. Results: Mothers <b>and</b> <b>nurses</b> in both nursery designs talked about Valuing interactions; the importance of interactions between mothers <b>and</b> <b>nurses.</b> Mothers <b>and</b> <b>nurses</b> described SFRs as providing a space, My/their room, which enhanced mothers' sense of control and connection with the infant. SFRs were also associated with Changing the norms of interactions with <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> other mothers, which created challenges in the desired quantity and quality of interactions for mothers <b>and</b> <b>nurses.</b> Nurses in the SFR nursery also reported Enhanced interactions, including improved confidentiality and personalized communication. Mothers in the OB nursery reported more supportive mothering actions from nurses than mothers in the SFR nursery. Both mothers <b>and</b> <b>nurses</b> in the OB nursery also talked about Our nursery community, which captured the value of having other <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> mothers in the rooms. Conclusion: Mothers <b>and</b> <b>nurses</b> perceived that the SFR nursery enhanced privacy and maternal closeness for mothers compared to the OB nursery.

40|$|ENGLISH ABSTRACT Title: The {{perceptions}} of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants on care-related prevention concerning people with dementia: a mixed methods approach. Background: Because {{of the growing}} number of people with dementia, care-related prevention activities done by <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants will become increasingly important to prevent complications and maintain an acceptable quality of life. Currently it’s unknown what the {{perceptions of}} <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants towards care-related prevention in dementia care are. Aim: To gain insight into the perceptions of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants towards care-related prevention so care-related prevention for people with dementia can be further improved in the future. Research question: How do <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants working in home care, residential or nursing homes perceive care-related prevention concerning people with dementia? Method: A mixed methods approach with survey research and individual semi-structured interviews. First, secondary analyses were done on existing survey data collected in 2011 on a sample of 206 <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants. Second, in March-May 2014 12 individual semi-structured interviews were conducted to embellish the quantitative results. Results: From this study three concepts related to the perceptions of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> CNAs towards care-related prevention activities emerged: attitude, knowledge and skills <b>and</b> the future. <b>Nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants think care-related prevention is a task of their profession. They experience insufficient knowledge and skills and they like to devote more time to care-related prevention in the future. Conclusion: <b>Nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants perceive care-related prevention to be part of their profession. They however express the need for more education on care-related prevention, preferably in a classroom setting. In the future, <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants like to devote more time to care-related prevention and e-health can support this. Recommendations: Additional training of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants focused on their different needs and use of e-health...|$|R

Okapis are herbivores, feeding on tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. Rut in males and estrus in females does not depend on the season. In captivity, estrous cycles recur every 15 days. The gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born.
