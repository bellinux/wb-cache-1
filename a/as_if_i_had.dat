Teller {{was one of the few}} scientists to actually watch (with eye protection) the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945, rather than follow orders to lie on the ground with backs turned.

In 1931 he again spent time in Berlin, writing to Aino in May 1931 that [...] "the symphony is advancing with rapid strides". Progress was interrupted by illness, but {{towards the end of the}} year Sibelius was confidently asserting that [...] "I am writing my eighth symphony and I am full of youth. How can this be explained?" [...] In May 1933, as he {{continued to}} deny Koussevitzky, Sibelius wrote in his diary that he was deeply immersed in composition: [...] "It is <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come home... I'm taking everything in another way, more deeply. A gypsy within me. Romantic." [...] Later that summer he informed a journalist that his new symphony was nearly complete: [...] "It will be the reckoning of my whole existence – sixty-eight years. It will probably be my last. Eight symphonies and a hundred songs. It has to be enough." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1910, Alexandra {{became the}} first queen consort to visit the British House of Commons during a debate. In a {{remarkable}} departure from precedent, for two hours {{she sat in the}} Ladies' Gallery overlooking the chamber while the Parliament Bill, a bill to remove the right of the House of Lords to veto legislation, was debated. Privately, Alexandra disagreed with the bill. Shortly afterward, she left to visit her brother, King George I of Greece, in Corfu. While there, she received news that King Edward was seriously ill. Alexandra returned at once and arrived just the day before her husband died. In his last hours, she personally administered oxygen from a gas cylinder to help him breathe. She told Frederick Ponsonby, [...] "I feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been turned into stone, unable to cry, unable to grasp the meaning of it all." [...] Later that year, she moved out of Buckingham Palace to Marlborough House, but she retained possession of Sandringham. The new king, Alexandra's son George, soon faced a decision over the Parliament Bill. Despite her personal views, Alexandra supported her son's reluctant agreement to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith's request to create sufficient Liberal peers after a general election if the Lords continued to block the legislation.|$|E

He later said, [...] "to go from the show business environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective.

I had never heard or seen Clancy before nor indeed did I ever see him again but he left an indelible impression of the superman, a man whose commands I at least would have a compulsion to obey <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been hypnotised ...

The organisation, [...] "Crivelli and Company" [...] which had managed both that house as well as La Fenice, was negotiating with a triumvirate consisting of Duke Pompeo Litta and two businessmen, their immediate concern being the engagement of singers and composers for La Scala. In order to contract with Bellini, he had to be released from his obligation to Venice; this was achieved by Litta buying out the Venice contract. When Bellini laid out his terms for writing for Milan, Litta gave him a very favourable response: [...] "I shall earn almost twice as much <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> composed for Crivelli [...] " [...] he noted {{in a letter to his}} uncle.|$|E

2500|$|The message (and its {{trailing}} padding) became famous, {{and created}} some ill feeling, since {{it appeared to}} be a harsh criticism by Nimitz of Halsey's decision to pursue the decoy carriers and leave the landings uncovered. [...] "I was stunned <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been struck in the face", Halsey later recalled. [...] "The paper rattled in my hands, I snatched off my cap, threw it on the deck, and shouted something I am ashamed to remember", letting out an anguished sob. RADM Robert Carney, Halsey's chief of staff (who had argued strongly in favor of pursuing the carriers), witnessed Halsey's emotional outburst and reportedly grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him, shouting, [...] "Stop it! What the hell's the matter with you? Pull yourself together!" [...] Recognizing his failure, Halsey sulked in inactivity for a full hour while Taffy 3 was fighting for its lifefalsely claiming to be refueling his shipsbefore eventually turning around with his two fastest battleships, three light cruisers and eight destroyers and heading back to Samar, too late to have any impact on the battle.|$|E
2500|$|Bowery {{used his}} body and {{manipulation}} of his flesh to create personas. This involved almost masochistically taping his torso and piercing his cheeks with pins in order to hold masks, as well as wearing outlandish makeup. [...] Freud said, [...] "the way he edits his body is amazingly aware and amazingly abandoned". In return, Bowery said of Freud: [...] "I love the psychological aspect of his work – in fact I sometimes felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been undergoing psychoanalysis with him ... His work is full of tension. Like me he {{is interested in the}} underbelly of things." [...] Bowery posed for a number of large full-length paintings that are considered among Freud's best work. The paintings tend to exaggerate Bowery's 6-foot 3inch, and 17 stone physique to monumental proportions. The paintings had a strong impact as part of Freud's exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1994. Freud said he found him [...] "perfectly beautiful", and commented, [...] "His wonderfully buoyant bulk was an instrument I felt I could use, especially those extraordinary dancer's legs." [...] Freud noted that Leigh by nature was a shy and gentle man, and his flamboyant persona was in part a form of self-defense.|$|E
2500|$|Israel (ranked 8th in the Davis Cup standings, with 5,394 points) hosted heavily favored Russia (which won in both 2002 and 2006, and was {{the top-ranked}} country in Davis Cup standings, with 27,897 points) in a Davis Cup quarterfinal tie in July 2009, on indoor hard courts at the Nokia Arena in Tel Aviv. [...] Israel was {{represented}} by Ram, Erlich, Dudi Sela, and Harel Levy. [...] Russia's lineup consisted of Marat Safin (# 24 in the world; former world # 1), Igor Andreev (26), Igor Kunitsyn (35), and Mikhail Youzhny (44; former world # 8). [...] The stage was set by Safin, who prior to the tie told the press: [...] "With all due respect, Israel was lucky {{to get to the}} quarterfinals." [...] The Israeli team's response was to beat the Russian team in each of their first three matches, thereby winning the tie. [...] Levy, world # 210, beat Russia's top player, Andreev, world # 24, 6–4, 6–2, 4–6, 6–2 in the opening match. [...] Sela (# 33) followed by beating Russian Youzhny 3–6, 6–1, 6–0, 7–5. [...] Israeli captain Eyal Ran likened his players to two fighter jets on court, saying: [...] "I felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> two F-16s out there today, they played amazingly well." [...] The 10,500 spectators were the largest crowd ever for a tennis match in Israel. [...] The next day Ram and Erlich beat Safin and Kunitsyn 6–3, 6–4, 6–7, 4–6, 6–4 in front of a boisterous crowd of over 10,000. [...] "I started to cry like a little boy", said Ram. [...] Even the Saudi Gazette described the doubles match as a [...] "thrilling" [...] win. [...] Captain Ran was carried shoulder-high around the Tel Aviv stadium, as the 10,000-strong crowd applauded. [...] With the tie clinched for Israel, the reverse singles rubbers were [...] "dead", and instead of best-of-five matches, best-of-three sets were played, with the outcomes of little to no importance. Israel wrapped up a 4–1 victory over Russia, as Levy defeated Kunitsyn 6–4, 4–6, 7–6, while Sela retired with a wrist injury while down 3–4 in the first set against Andreev. Ram said: [...] "We have all grown up together since the age of 14. The reason we are in the semis is because we are a united team." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{was posted}} on {{attachment}} to the 3rd The King's Own Hussars, which was serving in the North African Campaign at the time, and joined the regiment {{just in time for}} the beginning of Operation Compass. This was a British offensive against Italian forces in North Africa, which began in December, 1940, and participated in the Battle of Sidi Barrani. In the aftermath of one battle, he was detailed to supervise a burial party and came across a damaged Italian tank, its entire crew dead; unable to recover the bodies, Farran set the tank's petrol tank on fire. After Operation Compass came to an end, the Hussars were transferred to the island of Crete, to reinforce the British and Commonwealth forces that were stationed there after their retreat from Greece. Farran was attached to the regiment's 'C' Squadron, which was located several miles west of Canea when the Germans began their invasion of Crete on 20 May 1941. Farran was ordered to take a troop of tanks and block a road that led from the village of Galatas, and shortly afterwards sighted and killed a number of German troops escorting a group of 40 captured hospital patients. The troop came under attack from Stukas and well hidden ground forces. Returning from this mission Farran's troop encountered several Germans who attempted to surrender; he ordered them shot, later writing that the incident occurred in the heat of the moment. [...] On 21 May, the 10th Infantry Brigade launched a successful assault on Cemetery Hill, in which Farran participated. German forces were eventually able to break through the British and Commonwealth positions around Galatas, and Farran was part of a counter-attack in an attempt to retake the village. He protested about the unsuitability of his light tanks for the task but was told that no heavy tanks were left. Farran later wrote of his guilt at allowing the dangerous lead position to be taken by a subordinate -"I did not care for orders when it suited me, but this time I had chosen to obey them because I knew that I would be killed if I did not. I should have been in that leading tank. Instead, there was Skedgewell dead and his pretty young wife waiting at home. I felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> murdered him." [...] During the action he was wounded in the right arm and both of his legs, and as a result he was captured by German forces. It was at this time that he was awarded the Military Cross, for gallantry during his service in Crete.|$|E
2500|$|Our Rabbis {{taught that}} the {{obligation}} to confess sins comes {{on the eve of}} the Day of Atonement, as it grows dark. But the Sages said that one should confess before one has eaten and drunk, lest one become inebriated in the course of the meal. And even if one has confessed before eating and drinking, one should confess again after having eaten and drunk, because perhaps some wrong happened during the meal. And even if one has confessed during the evening prayer, one should confess again during the morning prayer. And even if one has confessed during the morning prayer, one should do so again during the Musaf additional prayer. And even if one has confessed during the Musaf, one should do so again during the afternoon prayer. And even if one has done so in the afternoon prayer, one should confess again in the Ne'ilah concluding prayer. The Gemara taught that the individual should say the confession after the (silent recitation of the) Amidah prayer, and the public reader says it in the middle of the Amidah. Rav taught that the confession begins: [...] "You know the secrets of eternity [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Samuel, however, taught that the confession begins: [...] "From the depths of the heart [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Levi said: [...] "And in Your Torah it is said, [...] " [...] (...) Rabbi Johanan taught that the confession begins: [...] "Lord of the Universe, [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Rav Judah said: [...] "Our iniquities are too many to count, and our sins too numerous to be counted." [...] Rav Hamnuna said: [...] "My God, before I was formed, I was of no worth, and now that I have been formed, it is <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not been formed. I am dust in my life, how much more in my death. Behold, I am before You like a vessel full of shame and reproach. May it be Your will that I sin no more, and what I have sinned wipe away in Your mercy, but not through suffering." [...] That was the confession of sins used by Rav all the year round, and by Rav Hamnuna the younger, on the Day of Atonement. Mar Zutra taught that one should say such prayers only if one has not already said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] but if one has said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] no more is necessary. For Bar Hamdudi taught that once he stood before Samuel, who was sitting, and when the public reader said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] Samuel rose, and so Bar Hamdudi inferred that this was the main confession.|$|E
