25|$|The control yokes also {{vary greatly}} amongst aircraft. There are yokes where roll is {{controlled}} by rotating the yoke clockwise/counterclockwise (like steering a car) and pitch {{is controlled by}} tilting the control column towards you or <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>you,</b> but in others the pitch is controlled by sliding the yoke {{into and out of}} the instrument panel (like most Cessnas, such as the 152 and 172), and in some the roll is controlled by sliding the whole yoke to the left and right (like the Cessna 162). Centre sticks also vary between aircraft. Some are directly connected to the control surfaces using cables, others (fly-by-wire airplanes) have a computer in between which then controls the electrical actuators.|$|E
500|$|Spears' {{cover of}} [...] "My Prerogative" [...] is musically {{different}} {{from its original}} version, with the bass and new jack swing sound replaced with a synthpop sound, synthesizers and elements typical of Bloodshy & Avant productions. It was noted by Christy Lemire of msnbc.com that the cover also contains elements of Bollywood music. At {{the beginning of the}} song, Spears says in a breathy voice the lines [...] "People can take everything <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>you</b> / But they can never take away your truth / But the question is, can you handle mine?". The rest of the lyrics do not deviate much from the original version, instead they are changed to fit a woman's perspective. Jennifer Vineyard of MTV commented the cover could be interpreted as a statement on Spears's life and the media reaction to some of her decisions at the time, including her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Stop", {{written by}} Christine McVie, {{is a song}} about optimism. She noted that Buckingham helped her craft the verses because their {{personal}} sensibilities overlapped. McVie's next track, [...] "Songbird", features more introspective lyrics about [...] "nobody and everybody" [...] {{in the form of}} [...] "a little prayer". [...] "Oh Daddy", the last McVie song on the album, was written about Fleetwood and his wife Jenny Boyd, who had just gotten back together. [...] The band's nickname for Fleetwood was [...] "The Big Daddy". McVie commented that the writing is slightly sarcastic and focuses on the drummer's direction for Fleetwood Mac, which always turned out to be right. Nicks provided the final lines [...] "And I can't walk <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>you,</b> baby/If I tried". Her own song, [...] "Gold Dust Woman", is inspired by Los Angeles and the hardship encountered in such a metropolis. After struggling with the rock lifestyle, Nicks became addicted to cocaine and the lyrics address her belief in [...] "keeping going".|$|E

500|$|For the song, {{which is}} a baroque pop ballad, Madonna uses a {{contrast}} of timbre, her higher smoother voice with her lower one. The song begins {{with the sound of}} violins for about 20seconds. After this, a drum machine, string arrangement and piano ushers on top of the violins, as Madonna sings the chorus line [...] "You can't hurt me now, I got <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>you,</b> I never thought I would." [...] The violins and the drum beats drop after the chorus, but come back again during the next bridge. As Madonna sings the verse [...] "Oh father I have sinned", the violins change their pitch to a higher one. After the second chorus, there is an instrumental break where she sings about the realization that her father did not want to hurt her but she still ran away. The song ends with the guitar and violins fading out with Madonna's voice. In an interview with Paul Zollo, Madonna commented that the [...] "Father" [...] can refer to Tony, God or all the [...] "authorities in her life".|$|E
500|$|Castroneves {{was upset}} about the penalty and leapt from his car and yelled in anger at the flagman (looking for an explanation) and grabbed the Head of Security Charles Burns as he sought an answer. He argued {{that he did not}} change his line: [...] "I {{actually}} gave him room outside. When you go side by side like that with your teammate and the guy [...] has just swept ... literally, literally just takes it <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>you</b> ... it's just absurd." [...] Castroneves was fined $60,000 by the IRL for unsportsmanlike conduct and was placed on probation {{for the rest of the}} season. It was later revealed by IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard that the series considered suspending Castroneves but chose not to because of his popularity with its fanbase. Castroneves later apologized for his actions but still did not agree with the penalty. Comparisons were made between Castroneves' block and the Brazilian's manoeuvre against Wilson in the 2008 Detroit Indy Grand Prix. Gordon Kirby of Motor Sport Magazine opined that Castroneves' move was fair and sportmanslike and noted that several fans saw it as [...] "good, hard racing".|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner", Carl {{evolves into}} a {{desensitized}} character and ultimately relinquishes his naïveté {{to the world}} around him. Although Entertainment Weekly writer Clark Collis drew parallels to a serial killer, Kirkman suggested this was an initiative to give more screen time to the character. He avouched that Carl was [...] "one of the most fun characters to tell stories about in this world." [...] He continued: [...] "It's true of the comic and it's true of the show. Over time, we’re {{going to start to}} see more and more of this kid. What's awesome about that is, think about {{what it would be like}} to grow up in this world. It's one thing to have everything you know taken <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>you</b> and have to deal with this s—y world you now have to live in. But to have barely even really recognized what the world is and how it works and what to expect and then to be thrust into this apocalyptic threat and to grow up and mature with these kinds of situations. It's going to make him grow up weird, is what I like to say." ...|$|E

500|$|Senators Larry Smith and Dante Fascell, {{a senior}} member of the firm, worked with the Cuban American National Foundation, Representative Claude Pepper of Florida, Neal Blair's Free the Eagle, and Howard Phillips' Conservative Caucus to repeal the Clark Amendment in 1985. From the amendment's repeal in 1985 to 1992 the U.S. {{government}} gave Savimbi $60million per year, a total of $420million. A sizable amount of the aid went to Savimbi's personal expenses. Black, Manafort filed foreign lobbying records with the U.S. Justice Department showing Savimbi's expenses during his U.S. visits. During his December 1990 visit he spent $136,424 at the Park Hyatt hotel and $2,705 in tips. He spent almost $473,000 in October 1991 during his week-long visit to Washington and Manhattan. He spent $98,022 in hotel bills, at the Park Hyatt, $26,709 in limousine rides in Washington and another $5,293 in Manhattan. Paul Manafort, a partner in the firm, charged Savimbi $19,300 in consulting and additional $1,712 in expenses. He also bought $1,143 worth of [...] "survival kits" [...] from Motorola. When questioned in an interview in 1990 about human rights abuses under Savimbi, Black said, [...] "Now when you're in a war, trying to manage a war, when the enemy... is no more than a couple of hours <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>you</b> at any given time, you might not run your territory according to New Hampshire town meeting rules." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the game, Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis {{was asked}} whether the game, {{following}} Notre Dame's 38–0 loss to USC, was a low point for the Fighting Irish.
