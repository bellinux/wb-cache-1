At only age 26, Salman was rewarded with a testimonial versus Tottenham Hotspur in May 1986, which brought him £5,552. The match brought down the curtain on an 11-year career at Griffin Park, during which Salman made 381 appearances and scored eight goals.

40|$|This thesis work {{is focused}} on the use of {{selected}} core-level x-ray spectroscopies to study semiconductor materials of great technological interest and on {{the development of a new}} implementation of <b>appearance</b> <b>potential</b> spectroscopy. Core-level spectroscopies can be exploited to study these materials with a local approach since they are sensitive to the electronic structure localized on a chemical species present in the sample examined. This approach, in fact, provides important micro-structural information that is difficult to obtain with techniques sensitive to the average properties of materials. In this thesis work we present a novel approach to the study of semiconductors with core-level spectroscopies based on an original analysis procedure that leads to an insightful understanding of the correlation between the local micro-structure and the spectral features observed. In particular, we studied the micro-structure of Hydrogen induced defects in nitride semiconductors, since the analysed materials show substantial variations of optical and electronic properties as a consequence of H incorporation. Finally, we present a novel implementation of soft x-ray <b>appearance</b> <b>potential</b> spectroscopy, a core-level spectroscopy that uses electrons as a source of excitation and has the great advantage of being an in-house technique. The original set-up illustrated was designed to reach a high signal-to-noise ratio for the acquisition of good quality spectra that can then be analyzed in the framework of the real space full multiple scattering theory. This technique has never been coupled with this analysis approach and therefore our work unite a novel implementation with an original data analysis method, enlarging the field of application of this technique. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A high {{performance}} soft x-ray <b>appearance</b> <b>potential</b> spectroscopy (SXAPS) {{system has been}} designed and built. Non-derivative spectra (without using a lock-in-amplifier) are measured at a few µA incident electron currents on samples. This is about 1 / 1000 of typical electron currents for SXAPS measurements. A new analytical method to obtain local density of empty states is developed. SXAPS Cr 2 p spectra of a Cr(110) surface have been measured by the system and density of empty states is deduced by using the method. The result is compared with x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) spectra, and a theoretical calculation. The present result indicates that local density of empty states for material surfaces can be easily deduced by the analytical method...|$|E
