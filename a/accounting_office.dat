5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was upset by the leaks and two investigations into them were held, one by the General <b>Accounting</b> <b>Office</b> {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks and said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E

Glenn requested investigations from the General <b>Accounting</b> <b>Office</b> of Congress and held several hearings on the issue. He spent the remainder of his Senate career acquiring funding to clean up the nuclear waste left at the facilities.

5|$|In March 1996, the US General <b>Accounting</b> <b>Office</b> (GAO) {{stated that}} it was cheaper to buy HarrierIIPlus {{aircraft}} outright than to remanufacture existing AV-8Bs. The USN estimated the cost for remanufacture of each aircraft to be US$23–30million, instead of $30million for each new-built aircraft, while the GAO estimated the cost per new aircraft at $24million. Nevertheless, the program continued and, in 2003, the 72nd and last AV-8B to be remanufactured for the USMC was delivered. Spain also participated in the program, the delivery of its last refurbished aircraft occurring in December 2003, which {{marked the end of}} the AV-8B's production; the final new AV-8B had been delivered in 1997.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} {{was used as}} a hospital during the American Civil War, and both Clara Barton and Walt Whitman worked as nurses there. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, the General Land Office, and the Bureau of Pensions jointly occupied the building with the Patent Office through the Civil War and into the post-war period. The massive increase in pension processing required by the Civil War led to {{the construction of a new}} Pension Bureau Building into which the Bureau of Pensions moved in 1887. The General Land Office and the Bureau of Indian Affairs vacated the building in 1898. The United States Civil Service Commission and the Government <b>Accounting</b> <b>Office</b> occupied the building after the Patent Office vacated it in 1932. The Government <b>Accounting</b> <b>Office</b> vacated the structure in 1942, after its new headquarters nearby was complete. The Civil Service Commission began constructing its own headquarters, and planned to vacate the building in 1962.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{outlines}} {{the critical role}} of employees’ general competencies in the link between career satisfaction and job outcomes (performance) in accounting firm services (<b>accounting</b> <b>offices).</b> Career satisfaction is an internally defined career success outcome. General competencies embrace abilities such as prioritizing, learning new things, coming-up with new ideas and solutions, working productively with others. The discussion arises primarily based on the considerable theoretical vagueness and empirical inconclusiveness in the existing literature concerning general competencies mechanisms and their contribution. As of interest to resolve this controversy, a research framework is developed in which general competencies act as the mediator between career success and employee performance in <b>accounting</b> <b>offices.</b> The empirical findings from a survey of 84 employees in <b>accounting</b> <b>offices</b> in Central Greece confirmed that general competencies exert a mediating effect {{on the relationship between}} career success satisfaction and job performance. The main implication of the findings for accounting managers is that employees in a career advancement environment are more likely to achieve higher job performance and subsequently effectiveness, as a result of strengthened general competencies. Thus, specific directions for managerial action have been derived...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{proposal}} for mitigation of the tax risk under the responsibility of Brazilian <b>accounting</b> <b>offices.</b> The increase in tax risk is brought mainly by advances in fiscal intelligence, represented by the comprehensiveness of provided supplementary information and consequently the increased power of detection by the tax Administration. This falls upon the responsibility of the accountant, as tax adviser, according to Brazilian law. Thus, preventative and tax-risk mitigation measures are required. A series of interviews with tax professionals, including accountants and tax advisers, accounting firm owners, and tax experts, detailed the activities performed by <b>accounting</b> <b>offices</b> in their tax advisory functions, including typical risks for each activity and a set of mitigation measures for risk management. We used the Delphi Method, since such an approach was not found in the literature. The proposal of this paper, and its main contribution, is the presentation of a table with risks and mitigation measures suggested by tax experts, as guidelines for risk management. <b>Accounting</b> <b>offices</b> are the main users of this proposal, but it can be extended to all professionals involved in tax advisory activities...|$|R
