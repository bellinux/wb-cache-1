30|$|The authors {{demonstrated}} a procedure for determining accurate geometric parameters of multilayer planar heterostructures by obtaining their cross sections {{by means of}} ion etching technique and a procedure for precision opening of any of their layers {{with the aim of}} its study (see Figs.  8, 9, 10, and 11).

The small <b>angle</b> <b>cross</b> section allows observing both lateral distribution of Ge in QDs at different depths and in the transition layers adjacent to them from above and from below. Ge-enriched rings located under the nanoislands and spread from the wetting layer deep to the substrate are discovered. They are located under the grooves surrounding QDs bases. They are formed because of intensive Ge diffusion into the substrate by the GeSi QDs lateral surfaces in the process of their evolution and growth.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{current study}} reveals the transgressive-regressive {{sequences}} and depositional environments of Paleogene Frysjaodden and Hollendardalen formations {{recorded in the}} Central Tertiary Basin of Spitsbergen. In addition, the most rapid and significant climatic perturbation of the Cenozoic era, known as PETM (Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum) is discussed using mineralogical data. The paleoenvironment has been reconstructed {{using a combination of}} sedimentary field data, XRD, micropaleontology and detailed analyses of clay minerals.

40|$|ABSTRACT. — The Mazıdağ {{phosphate}} beds of the Upper Cretaceous carbonate sequence were {{deposited in}} an area of upwelling water which supplied phosphorous was deposited on the sea bottom as biogenic detritus of zoo — and phytoplankton, fish bones and scales. The biogenic accumulation with high content of organic matter and phosphorous was a prime source of the phosphate which formed the phosphate deposits of the Mazıdağ—Derik area. Commonly, currents transported the phosphatic sediments laterally, forming parallel and low <b>angle</b> <b>cross</b> laminations. In some cases, the sea floor was uplifted after upwelling periods. Conse-quently, some phosphate beds underwent karstification, giving rise to phoscretes and silcretes. Ground water percoalating into the karstic realm caused phosphate replacement of many carbonate grains of the shallow water limestone facies. These complex events resulted in the formation of three basic phosphate peloid types in the Mazıdağ-Derik phosphate sequence, which are classified to the following origin of peloids: (1) in situ precipitation; (2) abrasion of phosphatized intraclast and bioclast and (3) phosphate micri-tization of fish bones.

Next, the cathode boundary condition was discretized with pipe elements, and corresponding experiments were designed to validate the mathematical model. Finally, the numerical simulation program BEASY was used to study the corrosion effect of DC stray current that an auxiliary anode bed generated in an impressed current cathodic protection system. The effects of <b>crossing</b> <b>angle,</b> <b>crossing</b> distance, distance of the two pipelines, anode output current, depth, and soil resistivity were investigated. Our results indicate that pipeline crossing substantially affects the corrosion potential of both protected and unprotected pipelines. Pipeline <b>crossing</b> <b>angles,</b> <b>crossing</b> distances, and anode depths, our results suggest, have no significant influence. Decreasing anode output current or soil resistivity reduces pipeline corrosion gradually. A reduction of corrosion also occurs when the distance between two parallel pipelines increases.|$|R

Two different chined-shaped fuselages were tested upright and inverted. It was found that a fuselage with a 30 " included chine angle resulted in significantly higher values of fuselage with a 100 " included chine angle. This difference was attributed to the more beneficial vortical interaction between the stronger forebody vortices coming off of the sharper chine edges and the wing vortices. The longitudinal stability of the configuration with the sharper chine angle was also better because, based on pressures and flow visualization, the vortex burst over the wing was delayed until significantly higher values of a.
