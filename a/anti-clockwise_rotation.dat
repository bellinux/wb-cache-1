This is very rarely the case, and was the reason for the choice of example.

In other applications, such as domestic light dimmers, the normal usage pattern is best satisfied if the potentiometer remains set at its current position, so the switch is operated by a push action, alternately on and off, by axial presses of the knob.|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{original}} aims for Galaxy Zoo was to explore which way galaxies rotated. Cosmologist Kate Land stated: [...] "Some people have argued that galaxies are rotating all in agreement with each other, not randomly as we'd expect. We want people to classify the galaxies according to which way they're rotating and I'll {{be able to go}} and see if there's anything bizarre going on. If there are any patterns that we're not expecting, it could really turn up some surprises." [...] In Galaxy Zoo 1, volunteers were asked to judge from the SDSS images whether the galaxies were elliptical or spiral and, if spiral, whether they were rotating in a clockwise or <b>anti-clockwise</b> direction. The <b>rotation,</b> also called the Chirality, of galaxies has been examined in several Galaxy Zoo related papers.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{have studied the}} {{mechanical}} and thermal behavior of {{a new class of}} auxetic lattices. We have started introducing a novel two-dimensional lattice family with three different realizations that leads to a Poisson's ratio arbitrarily close to the thermodynamic limit corresponding to ν = - 1. The effect is achieved by the superposition of clockwise and <b>anti-clockwise</b> internal <b>rotations</b> leading to a macroscopic non-chiral effect. We have detailed the kinematic of the mechanical system for three types of periodic lattices and we have determined analytically the macroscopic constitutive properties of these structures. The dependence of the effective properties on the constitutive and geometrical parameters of the micro-structure is given and a comparative analysis with hexagonal, triangular and square honeycombs is also performed. We have present also experimental evidence that the new lattices can achieve a negative Poisson's ratio ν=- 0. 9931 ± 0. 0025. Later we have extended our study to a three-dimensional model that can reproduce the same particular auxetic behavior. The system, we have introduced, has an elementary cell with cubic shape. We have proposed two different versions, these two different systems are generally anisotropic, or more precisely cubic according to symmetry consideration, but one of them can be modified in its structural properties so that the macroscopic behavior becomes isotropic. The anisotropic elastic character of the material is obviously reflected on the effective Young's modulus E and on the effective Poisson's ratio ν, which are therefore a function of the direction in the solid. We have given a complete numerical study of these two elastic constants in particular focusing on the Poisson's ratio ν. The maximum and minimum global Poisson's ratio ν obtained, for the anisotropic tridimensional lattice, are - 1 and 1. In the case of the isotropic tridimensional lattice, Poisson's ratio ν ranges from - 0. 58 to 0. 14. After having considered the mechanical behavior of the lattices we have studied their thermal behavior. The particular geometry of the micro-structures makes possible to have dissimilar expansions of the elements within the lattice, leading to an effective coefficient of thermal expansion {{different from that of the}} constituent elements. It is possible to reach strongly negative, null, or positive coefficient of thermal expansion using conventional constituent materials with positive thermal expansion. A theoretical expression of the macroscopic coefficient of thermal expansion of the lattices has been provided in full analytical form as a function of the coefficients of thermal expansion of the constituent materials and of the geometrical configuration of the lattices. We have tested experimentally a typology of lattice to prove that achieves a negative coefficient of thermal expansion. The novel systems are constructible at any length-scale, including the micro-scale, from conventional components with different mechanical and thermal properties, which may be combined to ensure the required macroscopic behavior. For this reason they can be used in several engineering fields: bio-medic, structural, aeronautics, civil, etc. An interesting aspect, that concerns the thermal behavior, is that the macroscopic thermal expansion is not anymore an intrinsic property of the material but it is correlated to the micro-structure and to the ratio between the coefficients of thermal expansion of the constituent materials. This allow for example to realize structure insensitive to temperature changes or with a specific coefficient of thermal expansion depending on the application, without no need to use special materials generally very expensive...|$|R

50|$|This {{technique}} is computationally fast, but the 2D results {{do not provide}} {{a good sense of}} depth of the original data. To improve the sense of 3D, animations are usually rendered of several MIP frames in which the viewpoint is slightly changed from one to the other, thus creating the illusion of rotation. This helps the viewer's perception to find the relative 3D positions of the object components. However, since the projection is orthographic the viewer cannot distinguish between left or right, front or back and even if the object is rotating clockwise or anti-clockwise. Use of depth weighting during production of rotating cines of MIP images can avoid the problem of difficulty of distinguishing right from left, and clockwise vs <b>anti-clockwise</b> <b>rotation.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{feature of}} many mills was the {{presence}} of trees or other structures shading the wheel from the intense summer sun. The reason for this was that when the wheel was not turning the wood components dried out and warped, putting {{a great deal of}} stress on the whole structure, putting it out of shape and creating breaks in the buckets, etc. At Dalgarven the wheel was originally enclosed by high walls which served the same purpose as trees.The Dalgarven wheel is a low breastshot, where the water strikes the wheel at a quarter of its diameter or height of the wheel and it turns with an <b>anti-clockwise</b> <b>rotation.</b> On the outer edge of each bucket is a 'sacrificial board' which will break away if any object becomes wedged beneath it. This is very important, as the stresses and strains set up by the wheel suddenly stopping would cause considerable damage to the various cogs and to the drive to the grinding stones themselves, which have significant mass and momentum when employed in the process of grinding. The use of iron brackets to provide support to the wooden paddles on the wheel is an unusual feature. The massive wooden hirst supporting the grindstones can be viewed from inside of the mill.|$|E
50|$|French {{philosopher and}} {{mathematician}} René Descartes {{was the first}} to propose a model for the origin of the Solar System in his Le Monde (ou Traité de lumière) which he wrote in 1632 and 1633 and for which he delayed publication because of the Inquisition and it was published only after his death in 1664. In his view, the Universe was filled with vortices of swirling particles and the Sun and planets had condensed from a particularly large vortex that had somehow contracted, which explained the circular motion of the planets and was on the right track with condensation and contraction. However, this was before Newton's theory of gravity and we now know matter does not behave in this fashion.The vortex model of 1944, formulated by German physicist and philosopher Baron Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, which harkens back to the Cartesian model, involved a pattern of turbulence-induced eddies in a Laplacian nebular disc.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of product market {{competition}} on the internal organization of a multi-divisional firm. The firm consists of two divisions which produce substitutes or complements or who use common resources (capital, labor, [...] .) in production. Information about the demand conditions of each division is held by self-interested division managers who communicate via cheap talk. The only available formal mechanism is the allocation of decision rights. The effect of an increase in competitive pressure on the optimal allocation of decision rights depends on how such an increase affects the demand functions that the divisions face. If it leads to a parallel, downward shift, it favors decentralization. If it leads to an <b>anti-clockwise</b> <b>rotation,</b> however, it tends to favor centralization.

Despite a wide (40 m) gouge zone in places, only between 5. 3 and 16. 8 km of Pliocene-Recent left-lateral offset occurs along the segment south of Mesyef, where up to 1100 m of down-to-the-east throw has been measured using the base Neogene volcanic rocks as a datum horizon.

40|$|Analysis of geomorphological {{features}} of Fusàro lagoon highlighted four main evolutionary stages, between 9000 yr BP and the present. The lagoon {{developed in the}} western sector of Phlegrean Fields active volcanic area during the mid-Holocene, within a wide marine bay bounded by Monte di Cuma and Torregaveta volcanoes. This shallow bay was gradually filled with Phlegrean pyroclastics and Volturno and Clanis river sediments, thus creating an open lagoon. During the late Holocene it evolved into a partially closed lagoon, due {{to the development of}} a littoral spit with dunes and marshlands. In the Graeco-Roman period, the total closure of the lagoon took place, following the stabilization of the foreland dune. Between the Roman period and 1941 AD three channels were opened to avoid the frequent environmental crises which affect this salt-water basin. At the end of the 18 th century the lagoon shape became similar to the present.

40|$|The defined {{shape and}} single-copy organelles of Trypanosoma brucei {{mean that it}} {{provides}} an excellent model in which to study how duplication and segregation of organelles is interfaced with morphogenesis of overall cell shape and form. The centriole or basal body of eukaryotic cells is often seen {{to be at the}} centre of such processes. We have used a combination of electron microscopy and electron tomography techniques to provide a detailed three-dimensional view of duplication of the basal body in trypanosomes. We show that the basal body duplication and maturation cycle exerts an influence on the intimately associated flagellar pocket membrane system that is the portal for secretion and uptake from this cell. At the start of the cell cycle, a probasal body is positioned anterior to the basal body of the existing flagellum. At the G 1 -S transition, the probasal body matures, elongates and invades the pre-existing flagellar pocket to form the new flagellar axoneme. The new basal body undergoes a spectacular <b>anti-clockwise</b> <b>rotation</b> around the old flagellum, while its short new axoneme is associated with the pre-existing flagellar pocket.

30|$|Another {{approach}} {{to study the}} participation of ATP molecules in DNA gyrase reactivation involved using ATP synthase inhibitors: Resveratrol (RVT), piceatannol (PCT), and sodium azide. Polyphenols, such as RVT, PCT and quercetin, inhibit E. coli ATP synthase. RVT and PCT inhibit ATP synthesis and ATP hydrolysis, whereas quercetin inhibits only ATP hydrolysis (Dadi et al. 2009). The inhibitory effects of these polyphenols were demonstrated by in vitro assays using purified F 1 or F 1 F 0 membrane preparations from E. coli cells grown in LB medium. RSV and PCT, but not quercetin, inhibit cell growth in liquid LB medium. The growth yield {{in the presence of}} these two polyphenols was 44 % (Dadi et al. 2009). ATPase activity in in vitro experiments and cell growth in LB cultures were inhibited when the cells were exposed to 400  μM RVT or 100  μM PCT (Dadi et al. 2009). In E. coli cells, RVT and PCT most likely prevent the synthetic and hydrolytic activity of ATP synthase by blocking the clockwise and <b>anti-clockwise</b> <b>rotation</b> of the γ-subunit of the enzyme, respectively, similar to the mechanism observed in bovine mitochondria (Gledhill et al. 2007).

Methods: The sample consisted of 80 children treated with either cervical headgear combined with full fixed appliances (n= 40, group 1), or with cervical headgear at first (n= 40, group 2). In both groups, lateral cephalometric radiographs were compared with those made at the beginning of treatment, at its end and at 5 -year post-retention phase, in order to quantify the cephalometric measures (8 angular and 3 linear), presenting the mandibular behavior in the antero-posterior and vertical directions. All patients were treated with no extraction and no use of Class II intermaxillary elastics during the full orthodontic treatment. Results: In both groups, the effective treatment of skeletal Class II malocclusion did not interfere in the direction and amount of growth of mandibular condyles and remodeling at the lower border, with no influence on the <b>anti-clockwise</b> <b>rotation</b> of the mandible. The mandibular growth also was observed after the orthodontic treatment, suggesting that it is influenced by genetic factors.

40|$|Background: Glucose {{transporter}} 4 (GLUT 4) is an insulin facilitated {{glucose transporter}} that {{plays an important}} role in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis. GLUT 4 is sequestered into intracellular vesicles in unstimulated cells and translocated to the plasma membrane by various stimuli. Understanding the structural details of GLUT 4 will provide insights into the mechanism of glucose transport and its regulation. To date, a crystal structure for GLUT 4 is not available. However, earlier work from our laboratory proposed a well validated homology model for GLUT 4 based on the experimental data available on GLUT 1 and the crystal structure data obtained from the glycerol 3 -phosphate transporter. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study, the dynamic behavior of GLUT 4 in a membrane environment was analyzed using three forms of GLUT 4 (apo, substrate and ATP-substrate bound states). Apo form simulation analysis revealed an extracellular open conformation of GLUT 4 in the membrane favoring easy exofacial binding of substrate. Simulation studies with the substrate bound form proposed a stable state of GLUT 4 with glucose, which can be a substrateoccluded state of the transporter. Principal component analysis suggested a clockwise movement for the domains in the apo form, whereas ATP substrate-bound form induced an <b>anti-clockwise</b> <b>rotation.</b> Simulation studies suggested distinct conformational changes for the GLUT 4 domains in the ATP substrate-bound form and favor a constricted behavior for the transport channel.

Methods A retrospective study of 44 eyes in 33 patients. All patients underwent similar uncomplicated phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Seven eyes with corneal astigmatism of less than 1. 5 D were implanted with the AcrySof SA 60 T 3 intraocular lens. Seventeen eyes with astigmatism between 1. 5 D and 2. 25 D received the SA 60 T 4 intraocular lens, and 20 eyes with more than 2. 25 D of corneal astigmatism received the SA 60 T 5 intraocular lens. Intraoperatively, the axis of the toric lens was aligned to the steepest axis of the corneal astigmatism. Main outcome measure was the postoperative position of the lens, assessed at 1 week and 3 months, using a specially designed angle measuring eyepiece for the slit lamp. Results There {{was no significant difference in}} the rotational stability of {{the three types of}} toric intraocular lenses. Overall, the postoperative rotation was within 5 degrees in 95 % and within 2 degrees in 68 % of eyes. The mean absolute rotation was 2. 2 ± 2. 2 degrees.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} interannual climate {{variability}} and {{change on the}} historic, directional wave climate of the Southern Hemisphere is presented. Owing {{to a lack of}} in situ wave observations, wave climate in the Southern Hemisphere is determined from satellite altimetry and global ocean wave models. Altimeter data span the period 1985 to present, {{with the exception of a}} 2 -year gap in 1989 – 1991. Interannual variability and trends in the significant wave height are determined from the satellite altimeter record (1991 to present), and the dominant modes of variability are identified using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. Significant wave heights in the Southern Ocean are observed to show a strong positive correlation with the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), particularly during Austral autumn and winter months. Correlation between altimeter derived significant wave heights and the Southern Oscillation Index is observed in the Pacific basin, which is consistent with several previous studies. Variability and trends of the directional wave climate are determined using the ERA- 40 Waves Re-analysis for the period 1980 – 2001. Significant wave height, mean wave period and mean wave direction data are used to describe the climate of the wave energy flux vector. An EOF analysis of the wave energy flux vector is carried out to determine the dominant modes of variability of the directional seasonal wave energy flux climate. The dominant mode of variability during autumn and winter months is strongly correlated to the SAM. There is an <b>anti-clockwise</b> <b>rotation</b> of wave direction with the southward intensification of the Southern Ocean storm belt associated with the SAM. Clockwise rotation of flu...|$|E
