500|$|On 4 December 2008, Che premiered at Miami Beach's Byron Carlyle Theatre, {{as part of}} the Art Basel Festival. Taking {{place only}} a few miles from Little Havana, which is home to the United States' largest Cuban American community, the invitation-only {{screening}} was met with angry demonstrators. The organization Vigilia Mambisa, led by Miguel Saavedra, amassed an estimated 100 demonstrators to decry what they believed would be a favorable depiction of Guevara. Saavedra told reporters from the El Nuevo Herald that [...] "you cannot offend the sensitivities of the people", while describing the film as [...] "a disgrace". A supporter of the demonstration, Miami Beach's mayor Matti Herrera Bower, lamented that the film was shown, while declaring [...] "we must not allow dissemination of this movie". When asked days later about the incident, Del Toro remarked that the ability to speak out was [...] "part of what makes America great" [...] while adding [...] "I find it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>weird</b> that they were protesting without having seen the film, but that's another matter". For his part, Soderbergh later stated that [...] "you have to separate the Cuban nationalist lobby that is centered in Miami {{from the rest of the}} country".|$|E
500|$|... "You do {{appreciate}} {{the absurdity of}} a group of rabbis in Israel claiming that I'm being blasphemous about someone when they haven't heard the record, right? And then, everyone in the media runs with it as if it's the truth. And that's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>weird.</b> But what's even weirder is that the song is not about Isaac Lurier, as the rabbis claim. It's named after Yitzhak Sinwani, who's singing in Yemenite on the track. I couldn't think of a title for the song. So I called it [...] "Isaac" [...] It's interesting how their minds work, those naughty rabbis. [...] He's saying, [...] "If all of the doors of all of the generous peoples' homes are closed to you, the gates of heaven will always be open." [...] The words are about 1,000 years old. [...] is an old friend of mine. He's never made a record. He comes from generations of beautiful singers. Stuart and I asked him to come into the studio one day. We said, [...] "We're just going to record you. We don't know what we're going to do with it." [...] He's flawless. One take, no bad notes. He doesn't even need a microphone. We took one of the songs he did and I said to Stuart, [...] "Let's sample these bits. We'll create a chorus and then I'll write lyrics around it." [...] That's how we constructed it." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the season, on 31 May 2008, Milan {{vice-president}} Adriano Galliani {{revealed that}} the club would loan Gourcuff to French club Bordeaux for the entire 2008–09 season to allow him more playing time. In 2010, {{in an interview with}} French newspaper L'Equipe, former Milan captain Paolo Maldini stated that Gourcuff lacked discipline while at the club and often distanced himself from the team citing the player's refusal to learn the Italian language. Maldini also stated that Gourcuff did not give his all during his stint at Milan and that the player himself knew it. Gourcuff did not respond to the comments, but his father Christian did, stating to France Football that {{there was some sort of}} conspiracy out there looking to tarnish his son's image. The elder Gourcuff responded to Maldini's charges stating his son [...] "took two hours (of Italian language courses) per day and spoke Italian after two months" [...] and that [...] "he is passionate about tactics" [...] in response to Maldini saying Gourcuff refused to learn Italian and he was limited tactically. Gourcuff was also defended by his club president Jean-Louis Triaud at his former club Bordeaux who stated in response to Maldini's comments [...] "Yoann is not like that. A number ten who does not play with the group is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>weird.</b> This does not correspond at all to what we saw with Yoann at Bordeaux. He was well integrated with his teammates, and collectively with them on the ground. He left good memories here." ...|$|E

500|$|Hoffman {{explained}} {{the key to}} his changeup was how he pinched the seam of the ball with his thumb and index finger as he released it. He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball looked the same to the batter. His changeup ranged from 73–76mph. Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said of Hoffman's changeup: [...] "He pitched so well off his fastball [...] couldn't just sit on it every pitch." [...] "You could be sitting on [...] and still not be successful with it", says former player Mark Sweeney. It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years. With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode. [...] "Some [...] fool you. Some guys overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", said former rival and later teammate Mike Piazza. After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, [...] "It's like it has a parachute on it." [...] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup. He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret. [...] "I was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>weird</b> about it", Hoffman said. [...] "I didn't like talking about how I threw the change. I didn't want people to see how I gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." [...] Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone had seen it.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the final}} game of the month Vancouver played the Rangers and former coach Alain Vigneault. Daniel Sedin said of the game: [...] "I know our former coach is over there, but once you get into the game you're not going to think too much about it. He was with us for seven years and he meant a lot to this franchise, so it's going to be fun seeing him again but once the game gets going we want the two points, and so does he". Tortarella stated: [...] "I'm not going to lie, it's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>weird</b> for me coming back, but once the game starts, it's about playing and {{trying to find a way}} to get a win". The Canucks lost the game 5–2, {{finishing}} the month with 31 points, four points out of the final playoff spot.|$|E
5000|$|The lead vocal was sung by Brian Wilson {{who thought}} his {{performance}} was inadequate, explaining, [...] "Vocally, I thought I sounded <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>weird</b> in my head.

I just didn't like my voice on that particular song." ...|$|R
5000|$|This ninth {{monologue}} was {{the first}} of these to be written. It was performed by Henry Peters at a scratch night called Candlewasters at Bedlam Theatre, Edinburgh, early 2008. Hickson Explains [...] "Buttons was left out of the final line-up of Eight because his syndrome was too niche to appeal to the wide demographic at the Fringe - he was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too <b>weird.</b> I am, however, incredibly fond and proud of this monologue; this ninth man, is, after all, where it all began." ...|$|R

Pattinson describing the film said that [...] "It's about the youth of a future dictator in the Thirties, like an amalgamation of Hitler, Mussolini and some others." [...] Bejo talking about her character in the film said that [...] "(I'm playing) {{the character of a}} mother whose son is very particular, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> awkward and <b>weird.</b> Over the scenes you're realizing {{that it is not a}} normal guy, he'll become a monster or something.

2500|$|The {{band was}} formed in 2008 by Matthew Tybor, also {{referred}} to as [...] "The Bunny" [...] hence the rabbit mask and persona he incorporates in the group. Tybor was quickly joined by Chris Hutka, known as [...] "The Bear" [...] who likewise, wears a bear mask. In an interview, when asked about the meaning behind the band name and the masks, Tybor stated that [...] "I'm <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>weird</b> and a little off, but it was nothing in-depth or a serious meaning behind it. It was more of a random, incoherent thought and I ran with it". The Bunny (Tybor) employs screamed vocals for the band while The Bear provides clean vocals. The band's first five albums featured Chris Hutka as The Bear. Their sixth album A Liar Wrote This features Hutka's then-replacement, Haley Roback, and their seventh album The Way We Rust features Joseph Garcia, who had toured with the band in the past.|$|E
60|$|I {{have not}} seen Bulwer's changed story. I brought back the first month with me, and I know {{the nature of his}} changes throughout; but I have not yet had the revised proofs. He was in a better state at Knebworth than I have ever seen him in all these years, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>weird</b> {{occasionally}} regarding magic and spirits, but perfectly fair and frank under opposition. He was talkative, anecdotical, and droll; looked young and well, laughed heartily, and enjoyed some games we played with great zest. In his artist character and talk he was full of interest and matter, but that he always is. Socially, he seemed to me almost a new man. I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and so did Georgina and Mary.|$|E

[...] Eurogamer rated it 8/10 and wrote, [...] "Yes, the touch controls sometimes work against it and, like Baby, the game occasionally stumbles over its own feet, {{but for the most}} part it walks the fine line between the weird and the wonderful with aplomb." [...] IGN rated it 7.5/10 and wrote, [...] "Filled with interesting ideas, Murasaki Babys dazzling animation and unique approach to platforming are enticing. Moving Baby around with the spotty touch controls can be frustrating, but this short confection is sweet enough while it lasts." [...] GameSpot rated it 7/10 and wrote, [...] "Controlling Murasaki Baby can be tiresome, and your hands are too often covering the dazzling, shadowy vistas that provide such a distinctive personality. Still, this often-touching adventure is too great an audio-visual treat to discount." [...] Game Informer rated it 6/10 and wrote, [...] "Murasaki Baby is <b>a</b> <b>weird</b> <b>little</b> game about <b>a</b> <b>weird</b> <b>little</b> girl lost in a weird-looking world.

[...] He also stated that [...] "Talk Back and You're Dead makes so little sense that it {{may as well be}} taking place in an entirely different universe.

60|$|At the {{junction}} I fetched the sleepy-looking porter {{to see to}} her luggage, and then left her. My rug I left in the station-master's office, and with the dispatch-box in my hand I climbed the steps from the station, and turned into the long straight road which led to Braster. I had barely gone a hundred yards when a small motor brougham, with blazing lights and insistent horn, came flying past me and on into the darkness.

5000|$|... "Breaking Up the Girl" [...] {{was written}} and {{recorded}} by Garbage between April 2000 and May 2001 at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin during the year-long writing sessions for Beautiful Garbage. At {{some point in}} this period of time, Shirley Manson had overheard {{the rest of the}} band working on the body of the song, and was inspired to write the melody and lyrics. During the development of the song, Garbage experimented with Beatles-like harmonies and ad-libs over the coda. and layered a vocal from Manson onto a matching guitar part. [...] "We sampled her going 'aah' and Duke played guitar," [...] Butch Vig explained,"and that made it sound like <b>a</b> <b>weird</b> <b>little</b> melodic quote, not necessarily a vocal part". Although {{it was one of the}} album's straightforward rock songs, Garbage couldn't agree on the bass/kickdrum pattern in the chorus, trying various transmutations of a one-bar phrase. Using his Fender Precision Bass and pick, session musician Daniel Shulman created a McCartney-esque bass movement for the verse. Vig felt that the strumming of the guitar chords gave the song a Big Star feel.|$|R
