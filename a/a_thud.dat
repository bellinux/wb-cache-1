25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Chicago {{increased}} its lead with Gould nailing a 41-yard field {{goal for the}} only score of the period. However, in the fourth quarter, New York took the lead with QB Eli Manning completing a 6-yard TD pass to WR Amani Toomer, along with RB Reuben Droughns. The Bears did have one final attempt, but it ended with <b>a</b> <b>thud.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} of the 30th we had not a moment of repose, as every moment we heard the loud crush of houses {{collapsing}} under of stones, mud, and ashes piled upon them, and feared that the turn of the convento and the church of Casasay would come in next. Shortly before daybreak of December 1 there was a tremendous crash as if the house were coming down on our heads: the roof of the apse of the church had caved in! Not long afterward, the roof of their kitchen gave away with <b>a</b> <b>thud.</b> Both were tile roofs.|$|E
2500|$|The old plan of a [...] "drop" [...] was {{discarded}} {{for a more}} merciful machine, {{by which}} the prisoner is jerked up from a platform on the ground level by a weight of 280 lbs, which is suspended by an independent rope pending the execution â€¦ At the words [...] "Forgive us our trespasses," [...] the executioner drove his chisel against the light rope that held the ponderous iron {{at the other end}} of the noose, and in an instant the heavy weight fell with <b>a</b> <b>thud,</b> and the [...] body was jerked into the air and hung dangling between the rough posts of the scaffold.|$|E
50|$|He {{was already}} a fast {{freestyle}} swimmer with <b>a</b> <b>thudding</b> kick {{when he went to}} Xalapa to study law and to be coached in swimming.|$|R
50|$|Lyle scored {{impressive}} {{victories over}} rated Jose Luis Garcia, and big names Oscar Bonavena and Earnie Shavers during his career. He also won a split decision over Joe Bugner, boring in with <b>a</b> <b>thudding</b> body attack {{in a fine}} contest.|$|R
60|$|Paolo {{withdrew a}} few paces, then Hector gave another pull. The rope gave way at once. He {{flattened}} {{himself against the}} house, and the hook fell with <b>a</b> dull <b>thud</b> <b>a</b> foot or two away.|$|R
2500|$|Each {{body was}} {{inspected}} {{by a physician}} to ensure that death had occurred. The bodies of the executed were allowed to hang for about 30 minutes and soldiers began to cut them down at 1:53 P.M. A corporal raced {{to the top of}} the gallows and cut down Atzerodt's body, which fell to the ground with <b>a</b> <b>thud.</b> He was reprimanded, and the other bodies were cut down more gently. Herold's body was next, followed by Powell's. Surratt's body was cut down at 1:58 P.M. As Surratt's body was cut loose, her head fell forward. A soldier joked, [...] "She makes a good bow" [...] and was rebuked by an officer for his poor use of humor.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{national}} publications speculated on Portman {{becoming the}} vice presidential nominee soon after Romney became the presumptive nominee. In [...] "Why Rob Portman Will Be Romney's Vice Presidential Nominee," [...] an article in The Atlantic, acclaimed syndicated journalist Major Garrett authored [...] "In the frenzied environment that will accompany the prelude to Romney's pick, the Portman choice may land with <b>a</b> <b>thud</b> on the charisma meter, but it won't {{set in motion a}} wave of [...] "guess what" [...] stories and will allow Romney to focus on the campaign, not thorny revelations that must be ritualistically turned into an us-against-them media meme. In fact, Portman might actually talk Boston out of its hypertensive and allergic reactions to reporters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Operating in the {{supposedly}} inviolable {{waters of the}} Sea of Japan, the wolf pack attacked shipping and made exploratory attempts to enter Japanese harbors. Late on 9 June, Tunny attacked a cargo vessel. One torpedo hit the enemy vessel with <b>a</b> <b>thud</b> but failed to explode, and Tunny discontinued the attack. In the harbor entering phase of the patrol, Tunny closed the breakwater of Etomo Ko to 8,000yards (7.3km) shortly before midnight on 12 June. Town and waterfront lights provided illumination, but no suitable target could be found, and the submarine cleared the harbor before midnight. A few minutes later, Tunny approached within [...] of the harbor mouth at Uppuri Wan but discreetly withdrew when searchlights located and then brilliantly illuminated the intruder.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Spencer {{shut down}} the pantry window with <b>a</b> vicious <b>thud.</b>|$|R
60|$|Nas Ta Bega {{turned the}} mustangs loose among those Shefford had noticed, and {{presently}} there rose a snorting, whistling, kicking, plunging melee. A {{cloud of dust}} hid them, and then <b>a</b> <b>thudding</b> of swift hoofs told of a run through the cedars. Joe Lake began picking over stacks of goat-skins and bags of wool that were piled against the hogan.|$|R
60|$|Still no sound, except <b>a</b> little <b>thud</b> from Tootles as {{he dropped}} on his knees.|$|R
2500|$|A {{light rain}} was falling and {{visibility}} was poor when, {{half an hour}} before morning twilight, Tunny began a radar approach. Rapidly shoaling water less than 20fathoms (37m) deep and land masses on two sides of the submarine limited her maneuverability. At , the extreme phosphorescence of the water illuminated her wake and betrayed her presence to the enemy ship, which began signaling the unidentified intruder with a blinker light. Despite her detection, Tunny continued the approach until she was only [...] from the target and then launched three torpedoes. The Japanese ship, now discernible as a loaded tanker, began to maneuver radically and opened fire on the submarine. Undeterred, Tunny submerged and continued the attack, firing a second volley from her stern tubes. One of these torpedoes hit the side of the tanker with <b>a</b> <b>thud,</b> but without explosion, and a small column of water erupted just forward of the tanker's bridge. Duds and prematures were a problem for American submarines early in 1943, and verification that this torpedo had indeed hit the tanker, but failed to detonate, was forthcoming when members of the tanker's crew dashed to the spot in question and began examining the impact area with flashlights. Despite continuous fire from the ship and the proximity of land, Tunny managed to stay within firing range of her target by traveling at full speed. After the tanker successfully evaded Tunnys third salvo, the submarine fired a last torpedo from [...] as the intended victim reached the passage into Hong Kong. Following this disappointing conclusion to her attack, Tunny dove in anticipation of search planes which appeared within two hours and continued their surveillance throughout the day.|$|E
6000|$|Frink {{spoke with}} gravity: [...] "Is some one there?" [...] <b>A</b> <b>thud.</b> [...] "Is one knock {{to be the}} sign for 'yes'?" [...] <b>A</b> <b>thud.</b> [...] "And two for 'no'?" [...] <b>A</b> <b>thud.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>thud.</b> The {{spirit of}} Dante {{had come to}} the parlor of George F. Babbitt.|$|E
60|$|Macdonald {{held his}} hand up, and <b>a</b> rapid <b>thud</b> of hoofs came faintly through the silence.|$|R
6000|$|SWEEDLE {{can be seen}} staring {{through the}} outer door. There are [...] sounds of {{footsteps}} descending the stone stairs; suddenly <b>a</b> dull [...] <b>thud,</b> <b>a</b> faint [...] "My God!" [...] in WISTER's voice.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{there came}} <b>a</b> violent <b>thud</b> {{against the door}} of the parlour, a sharp cry, and then--silence.|$|R
60|$|APOLLODORUS (returning to the table). No, <b>a</b> <b>thud.</b> Something {{fell on the}} beach, I think.|$|E
60|$|Clark's eyes shot fire, and {{he brought}} down the stock of his rifle with <b>a</b> <b>thud.</b>|$|E
60|$|Johnny's moccasined feet {{struck the}} floor with <b>a</b> <b>thud</b> as he wriggled out of his hammock.|$|E

60|$|From {{some point}} {{farther down the}} {{corridor}} came <b>a</b> muffled <b>thudding.</b> Ann stopped her work to listen.|$|R
60|$|A seal-skin case {{came with}} <b>a</b> soft <b>thud</b> {{on to the}} floor. Ida opened it. It was full.|$|R
60|$|As I rode past an orchard, an apple, {{loosened}} by the rainstorm, {{came down}} with <b>a</b> <b>thud.</b>|$|E
60|$|The snowball was {{launched}} forth with swiftness and with <b>a</b> <b>thud</b> struck the spot {{directly in the}} center.|$|E
60|$|There was a howl and <b>a</b> <b>thud,</b> and John {{resumed his}} stroll. The first gun from Fort Sumter had been fired.|$|E
60|$|There {{was silence}} for a few seconds, then <b>a</b> {{simultaneous}} <b>thud</b> and bursting cry that was eminently suggestive.|$|R
60|$|The two men became silent, listening. There was <b>a</b> heavy <b>thud,</b> <b>a</b> {{concussion}} {{that made}} their seat shiver. The passers-by stopped, shouted to one another. The {{old man was}} full of questions; he shouted {{to a man who}} passed near. Graham, emboldened by his example, got up and accosted others. None knew what had happened.|$|R
60|$|Philip's heart gave <b>a</b> great <b>thud</b> {{against his}} ribs, {{and he let}} the door handle go. The door swung to.|$|R
60|$|No one answered. But a heavy {{piece of}} the adobe wall fell with <b>a</b> <b>thud.</b> Duane heard it crack, felt it shake.|$|E
60|$|Dan Baxter {{broke off}} short and {{all in the}} cabin listened. There was <b>a</b> <b>thud</b> and a crash, {{followed}} by another crash.|$|E
60|$|The weak-kneed wastrel let {{fall the}} box with <b>a</b> <b>thud</b> upon the floor. Mrs. Postwhistle looked her new {{assistant}} up and down.|$|E
60|$|It rose beautifully, like a rocket, {{and fell}} {{inside of the}} ramparts, making only <b>a</b> little <b>thud</b> of <b>a</b> sound.|$|R

60|$|She heard <b>a</b> <b>thudding</b> of hoofs {{down the}} slope, then Dale's clear, strong call. She answered. It {{appeared}} {{long before he}} {{burst out of the}} woods, riding hard and leading her horse. In that time she recovered fully, and when he reached her, to put a sudden halt upon the fiery Ranger, she caught the bridle he threw and swiftly mounted her horse. The feel of the saddle seemed different. Dale's piercing gray glance thrilled her strangely.|$|R
