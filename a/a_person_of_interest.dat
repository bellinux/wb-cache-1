5|$|Phillip, 58, and his wife, Nancy Garrido, 54, of Antioch, {{were arrested}} by police for {{kidnapping}}, imprisonment, and sexual assault. On April 28, 2011, they {{pleaded guilty to}} Dugard's kidnapping and sexual assault. Law enforcement officers believe Dugard was kept in concealed tents, sheds, and lean-tos in an area behind the Garridos' house in Antioch for 18 years. During this time, Dugard bore two daughters who were ages 11 and 15 {{at the time of}} her reappearance. On June 2, 2011, Garrido was sentenced to 431 years to life imprisonment; his wife, Nancy, received 36 years to life. Garrido is <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in at least one other San Francisco Bay Area missing person case.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav {{government}} of the newly formed FR Yugoslavia (successor to SFR Yugoslavia) ended up having three ideologically-opposed leaders occupying executive positions. From 1992, while Slobodan Milošević {{was the president of}} the Federal Republic of Serbia, national theorist Dobrica Ćosić was named President of FR Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, Milan Panić, a business magnate based in Newport Beach, California, accepted Milošević's invitation to be Prime Minister. Panić was subsequently elected as Prime Minister in the 1992 Yugoslav parliamentary elections. The United States did not revoke Panić's citizenship even though his occupation of an executive position in the Yugoslav government clearly contradicted the United States Constitution. Nevertheless, Panić would become <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in US diplomatic circles, given his business and residence backgrounds. At a CSCE meeting in Helsinki in July 1992, US Secretary of State James Baker abruptly dismissed Panić's appeal to reduce the sanctions to Yugoslavia, even after an agreement (between Panić, Milošević, and Dušan Mitević) was reached by which Milošević would resign in return for sanction-relief. This ended up severely damaging Panić's unique diplomatic position internationally, as well as his standing in Yugoslavia. The Los Angeles Times published an article which described Panić as a doubtful upholder of potential American-Yugoslavian peacemaking, when in fact, many years later made to be known, Panić was actually invited by Baker in the first place rather than voluntarily coming to Helsinki.|$|E

40|$|In {{most cases}} today when a {{specific}} person's whereabouts is monitored through video surveillance {{it is done}} manually {{and his or her}} location when not seen is based on assumptions on how fast he or she can move. Since humans are good at recognizing people this can be done accurately, given good video data, but the time needed to go through all data is extensive and therefore expensive. Because of the rapid technical development computers are getting cheaper to use and therefore more interesting to use for tedious work. This thesis is a part of a larger project that aims to see to what extent it is possible to estimate <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest's</b> time dependent 3 D position, when seen in surveillance videos. The surveillance videos are recorded with non overlapping monocular cameras. Furthermore the project aims to see if the <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest's</b> movement, when position data is unavailable, could be predicted. The outcome of the project is a software capable <b>of</b> following <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest's</b> movement with <b>an</b> error estimate visualized as an area indicating where the <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> might be at a specific time. This thesis main focus is to implement and evaluate a people detector meant {{to be used in the}} project, reduce noise in position measurement, predict the position when the <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest's</b> location is unknown, and to evaluate the complete project. The project combines known methods in computer vision and signal processing and the outcome is a software that can be used on a normal PC running on a Windows operating system. The software implemented in the thesis use a Hough transform based people detector and a Kalman filter for one step ahead prediction. The detector is evaluated with known methods such as Miss-rate vs. False Positives per Window or Image (FPPW and FPPI respectively)  and Recall vs. 1 -Precision. The results indicate that it is possible to estimate <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest's</b> 3 D position with single monocular cameras. It is also possible to follow the movement, to some extent, were position data are unavailable. However the software needs more work in order to be robust enough to handle the diversity that may appear in different environments and to handle large scale sensor networks...|$|R

25|$|James Precht's hearing {{took place}} on 2 December 2014 and his trial, lacking a jury, began on 4 December, two days later. During the trial, Precht pleaded guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct, which reduced {{consequences}} to twenty-five days in jail, the majority {{of which he had}} spent incarcerated. Prosecutors did, however, request that he be placed on probation, since he remains <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in the case. During sentencing, Precht was sentenced to an additional four days in jail on top of the twenty-five days in jail.|$|E
25|$|Two Christchurch {{addresses}} {{inhabited by}} members of the Save Happy Valley Campaign were also visited by police in search of <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> however, they did not have a search warrant and were refused access to the properties. Save Happy Valley is a group of environmentalist activists that use direct action, such as locking themselves to railway tracks, to oppose Solid Energy's coal mining in the Happy Valley region. Police later located the person at another Christchurch residence. The man had attended the camp in the Urewera Range after an invitation from Tuhoe activists, according to a source close to him.|$|E

25|$|However, {{police were}} not able to develop any {{evidence}} from this material that might have helped them locate Bethany. Roldan later stopped cooperating with the investigation; he has subsequently been described by law enforcement as <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Emile Decker later obtained a divorce from his missing wife. It has since been reported that he will no longer talk with investigators unless his lawyer, who says his client has nothing to hide, is also present. No record was ever found suggesting that Bethany had given birth by her expected due date later that summer, although Loudoun County police distributed to the public pictures of what she might look like near the end of a pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|On September 28, 2015, {{information}} was released {{that the body}} of the unidentified victim was formally identified as Gerow in April 2015 and her body would be returned to family members. The identification was made through comparison of the family's DNA compared to that of the victim. Gerow's father, William Sr., stated he did not understand any possible motive for the death of his daughter. Kalhauser is considered <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in the murder since the photograph was discovered and police have also asked for information regarding him as well as the victim during the two decades of her life. After the family received the remains of the victim, the body was cremated.|$|E

25|$|Decker {{was five}} months {{pregnant}} {{at the time}} of her disappearance. Extensive searches have found no trace of her or the child she might have given birth to. Roldan, who had a criminal record prior to the disappearance, is considered <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in the case. In 2015, he was arrested in North Carolina and charged with the attempted murder of another girlfriend after she survived several gunshot wounds he allegedly inflicted on her during an incident in 2014; he has not said anything about the Decker case. After she recovered, the victim claimed on the Dr. Phil show that he had made statements to her that might implicate him in Decker's disappearance. The incident has also been the subject of a segment of the Investigation Discovery channel series Disappeared. Roldan pled guilty to two lesser charges in 2016; after he serves his sentence he will deported to his native Bolivia.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{discovered}} {{that one of the}} last people to see Paula alive was a man who lived along Harbour Road. He {{was in the midst of}} an argument with his girlfriend when she walked by. The man stormed off in a jealous rage shortly thereafter and depending on different statements he made, he went to his shack and spent the evening by himself, or he drove his truck up the travel portion of the trail (where Paula was heading). He lied to police on several occasions and was <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in 1946 and again in 1952 when the case was revisited. Reportedly, he told at least two people that he knew within a hundred feet where Paula was buried but later claimed it was just idle talk. When no evidence was found that a crime had actually been committed, no body was ever discovered, and no forensic clues were identified, this avenue of the investigation ended.|$|E
25|$|Since Cole's identification, {{investigation}} is now aimed at locating {{the person responsible}} for her murder. Frances Aucoin, whose father, John Chesson, discovered Cole's remains along with her brother, told officers that she suspects he is responsible for the victim's death. Police confirm that Chesson is considered <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in the case, especially because of his conviction for the murder of his estranged wife's former mother-in-law, but he has yet to be considered the prime suspect. Aucoin believes that Chesson had decided to go hunting {{for the first time with}} his children to establish his innocence by finding the victim's body and reporting it to the police. She went into further detail, describing her father as abusive and that she believes that a young woman he had brought into their home was Cole whom he had picked up as a hitchhiker. Aucoin's brother, a witness in finding the body, committed suicide in 2008. Chesson is currently incarcerated for life for the murder of his estranged wife's former mother-in-law, which occurred in 1997.|$|E
