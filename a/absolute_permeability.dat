An inverse correlation was observed between porosity–permeability and depth for the porous media under study.

The technique allows upscaling {{of the usual}} parameters porosity and relative and <b>absolute</b> <b>permeabilities,</b> and also the location of wells and capillary pressure.

Upscaling is achieved by explicitly decomposing the dierential system into a coarse-grid-scale operator coupled to a subgrid-scale operator, which we localize by imposing a closure assumption. We approximate the coarse-grid-scale operator with a mixed nite element method that has a second order accurate velocity coupled implicitly to the subgrid scale.

For comparison, the same channels were packed with sintered copper mono-dispersed porous media. Experiments were conducted using distilled water as the working fluid. The <b>absolute</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of the sintered copper mono- and bi-dispersed porous media were firstly determined by measuring pressure drops at different inlet velocities of the isothermal flow of subcooled water. Experiments were then carried out to characterize flow boiling of water through both mono-and bi-dispersed porous channels. The pressure drops under the boiling condition were also measured.

40|$|Since the {{industrial}} revolution we have produced more carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming. Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) {{has been working on}} technical solutions that will capture carbon dioxide, which is being produced as a product of industrialization. This captured carbon dioxide will be transported to suited storage areas. These storage areas can be geological formation, often old oil & gas reservoirs. For the CCS to safely store the carbon dioxide, it needs to be transported to the location, and then injected into the reservoir. Injection requires knowledge, as the deposition sites can be more than a kilometer below the ground. This thesis will focus on creating a model to simulate CO 2 -injection. The model is created in MATLAB, and will simulate problems such as: colloidal fine particles and salt precipitation. This model will help to understand how a rock formation act during injection. <b>Absolute</b> <b>permeabilities</b> and relative imjectivity are the key results that will be measured by this model...|$|R
30|$|The {{heterogeneity}} of reservoirs causes upscaling issues when {{moving from the}} core scale to the reservoir scale. In particular, the values of <b>absolute</b> hydraulic <b>permeability,</b> porosity, relative hydraulic <b>permeability,</b> and <b>absolute</b> and relative electro-osmotic permeability are usually determined at the core scale, which causes problems when using these values at the reservoir scale (Ghazanfari 2013). In this study, for simplicity, we are considering a homogeneous and isotropic reservoir to limit the effects of upscaling without, however, eliminating it completely.|$|R
30|$|It is {{important}} for shaly rocks to consider only <b>absolute</b> and relative <b>permeability</b> measurements {{to be carried out}} with saline water. Moore et al.

50|$|Muskat refined the {{original}} version of Darcy's equation for single-phase fluid (or homogenous fluid in Muskat terminology) flow by introducing fluid viscosity in the equation, as pointed out earlier by Charles Sumner Slichter, and replacing the hydraulic head by pressure and gravity force. The proportionality constant of the porous medium (which were both unconsolidated sand and consolidated sandstone in the laboratory experiments), using the new refined equation, is called single-phase permeability or <b>absolute</b> <b>permeability,</b> {{and is now a}} pure rock property as the fluid viscosity is explicit in the new flow equation. The pressure and gravity force link the refined equation to basic properties in physics, which makes the connection to capillary pressure, and thus Leverett J-function, direct and makes the connection to fluid density visible in the new equation. By these refinements Muskat established a refined flow equation for single phase fluid flow that is valid for water, oil and gas, and thus is suitable for use in the petroleum industry. Muskat and his colleagues verified the new equation by experiments.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] To {{examine the}} effects of clay {{swelling}} and dispersion on electrolyte concentration-permeability:relationships of low clay content soils, flow experiments were conducted on a silt of fixed particle size distribution containing 0, 5, 7. 5, 10 and 15 per cent clay (sodium illite, 2 #m fraction). Flocculated specimens were sedimented using both slow and rapid procedures. After compression each specimen was permeated successively with electrolyte solutions which caused (1) swelling of the clay fraction (0. 10 N), and (2) dispersion (0. 05 N). <b>Absolute</b> <b>permeabilities</b> varied with clay content, sedimentation procedure, compression rate, and electrolyte concentration; however, the form of this variation plotted against hrough-put volume was similar for all specimens containing electrolyte solutions causing only swelling of the clay. Increasing the hydraulic gradient above a critical value apparently increased the swelling slightly as evidenced by further reductions in permeability. The permeability of mixtures permeated with electrolyte solution causing dispersion of the clay was more complex and depended on clay content, the hydraulic gradients used to introduce the dispersing electrolyte solution and the pre-dispersion gradients to which the specimens had been subjected. Permeability decreases were attributed to the last stages of swelling prior to dispersion and to pore plugging. Increases in permeability were the result of erosion of dispersed particles. Specimens previously sub-jected to the highest gradients while swelling dispersed more rapidly and had a greater tendency to erode. The effects of predispersion gradients diminished with increasing clay contents. It is concluded that both compositional nd mechanical factors {{play an important role in}} determining electrolyte con-centration permeability relationships for soils containing active clay minerals...|$|R
50|$|The above {{equations}} {{are written}} in SI units (short SI) suppressing that the unit D (darcy) for the <b>absolute</b> <b>permeability</b> is defined in non-SI units. That is way there are no unit-related constants. The petroleum industry don't use the SI units. Instead they use a special version of SI units that we will call Applied SI units, or they use another set of units called Field units which has its origin from USA and UK. Temperature {{is not included in}} the equations, so we can use the factor-label method (also called unit-factor method) which says that if we have a variable/parameter with unit H, we multiply this variable/parameter by a conversion constant C and then the variable gets the unit G that we want. This means that we apply the transformation H*C = G, and the non-SI effect of the definition of permeability is included in the conversion factor C for permeability. The transformation H*C = G apply for every spatial dimension so we concentrate on the main terms, neglecting the signs, and then complete the parenthesis with the gravity term. Before we start conversion, we notice that both the original (single phase) the flow equation of Darcy and the generalized (or extended) multiphase flow equations of Muskat et al. are using reservoir velocity (volume flux), volume rate and densities. The units of these quantities are given a prefix r (or R) in order to distinguish them from their counterparts at standard surface conditions which gets a prefix s (or S). This is especially important when we convert the equations to Field units. The reason for going into details in the seemingly simple topic of unit conversion, is that many people make mistakes when doing unit conversions.|$|E

Gas flow injection tests were performed at various distances inward from the wall of Room D to estimate the effects of creeping of the disturbed rock zone (DRZ) since excavation of Room D and boreholes, and to estimate the amount of healing of the DRZ {{that has taken place}} due to an emplaced concrete seal. Salt creeping into an excavation is expected to show increased porosity and <b>absolute</b> <b>permeability</b> values compared to undisturbed halite.

40|$|Repository {{performance}} models {{based on}} numerical simulation of fluid and heat flows {{have recently been}} developed by several different groups. Model conceptualizations generally focus on large-scale average behavior. This comparison finds that current performance assessment (PA) models use generally similar approximations and parameters. Certain differences exist in some performance-relevant parameters, especially <b>absolute</b> <b>permeabilities,</b> characteristic curves, and thermal conductivities. These reflect present uncertainties about the most appropriate parameters applicable to Yucca Mountain and must be resolved through future field observations and laboratory measurements. For a highly heterogeneous fractured-porous hydrogeologic system such as Yucca Mountain, water infiltration through the unsaturated zone {{is expected to be}} dominated by highly localized phenomena. These include fast channelized flow along preferential paths in fractures, and frequent local ponding. The extended dry repository concept proposed by the Livermore group is reviewed. Predictions of large-scale drying around the repository on the average for large thermal loads cannot be taken to indicate that waste packages will not be contacted by liquid water, and that aqueous-phase transport of contaminants is not possible. Specifically, the authors find that modest water infiltration, on the order of a few millimeters per year, would be sufficient to overwhelm the vaporization capacity of the repository heat and inundate the waste packages within a time frame of a few thousand years. A preliminary analysis indicates that channelized flow of water may persist over large vertical distances. The vaporization-condensation cycle has a capacity for generating huge amounts of ponded water. A small fraction of the total condensate, if ponded and then episodically released, would be sufficient to cause liquid phase to make contact with the waste packages...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGap {{junctions}} {{have traditionally}} been characterized as nonspecific pores between cells passing molecules up to 1 kDa in molecular mass. Nonetheless, {{it has become increasingly}} evident that different members of the connexin (Cx) family mediate quite distinct physiological processes and are often not interchangeable. Consistent with this observation, differences in permeability to natural metabolites have been reported for different connexins, although the physical basis for selectivity has not been established. Comparative studies of different members of the connexin family have provided evidence for ionic charge selectivity, but surprisingly little is known about how connexin composition affects the size of the pore. We have employed a series of Alexa dyes, which share similar structural characteristics but range in size from molecular weight 350 to 760, to probe the permeabilities and size limits of different connexin channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Correlated dye transfer and electrical measurements on each cell pair, in conjunction with a three-dimensional mathematical model of dye diffusion in the oocyte system, allowed us to obtain single channel permeabilities for all three dyes in six homotypic and four heterotypic channels. Cx 43 and Cx 32 channels passed all three dyes with similar efficiency, whereas Cx 26, Cx 40, and Cx 45 channels showed a significant drop-off in permeability with the largest dye. Cx 37 channels only showed significant permeability for the smaller two dyes, but at two- to sixfold lower levels than other connexins tested. In the heterotypic cases studied (Cx 26 /Cx 32 and Cx 43 /Cx 37), permeability characteristics were found to resemble the more restrictive parental homotypic channel. The most surprising finding of the study was that the <b>absolute</b> <b>permeabilities</b> calculated for all gap junctional channels in this study are, with one exception, at least 2 orders of magnitude greater than predicted purely on the basis of hindered pore diffusion. Consequently, affinity between the probes and the pore creating an energetically favorable in-pore environment, which would elevate permeant concentration within the pore and hence the flux, is strongly implicated...|$|R
