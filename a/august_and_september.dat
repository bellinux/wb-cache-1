5|$|Chemetco had a {{long history}} of violations. For example, in <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September</b> 1992, while taking air {{emission}} readings, Chemetco was caught using semi-articulated trucks and water sprinklers as a buffer in front of the air emission monitors. This was in contravention of the Clean Air Act, 42.|$|E

The communes responded positively to the project, adding some recommendations.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several years, Elsass {{and the rest of}} the fleet were {{occupied}} with the peacetime training regimen that consisted of squadron and fleet training in April and May, a major fleet cruise during the summer, followed by annual fall maneuvers with the whole fleet in <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September.</b> The year would typically conclude with a winter training cruise. For Elsass, her career began with squadron training in the North Sea and Baltic Sea in May, followed by the summer cruise in July and August. In August, before the annual fleet maneuvers, the British Channel Fleet visited the German fleet in Swinemünde. The year 1906 followed the same pattern, concluding with fleet exercises in the North Sea in December before returning to Kiel. Further maneuvers in the North Sea occupied the fleet for much of the first half of 1907, followed by a summer cruise to Norway and the annual autumn maneuvers in <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September.</b> KzS Reinhard Scheer replaced Bachmann in October 1907. The winter cruise that year went to the Baltic.|$|E
5|$|Gallaher's unit {{fought in}} the Battle of Messines, near La Basse Ville, and in <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September</b> 1917 they trained for the {{upcoming}} Passchendaele offensive. In the attack on Gravenstafel Spur on 4October 1917 Gallaher was wounded by a piece of shrapnel that penetrated through his helmet, and he died later that day at the 3rd Australian Casualty Clearing Station, Gravenstafel Spur. He was 43 years old.|$|E

5|$|In 1845–46, Urbain Le Verrier, {{independently}} of Adams, developed his own calculations but aroused no enthusiasm in his compatriots. In June 1846, upon seeing Le Verrier's first published {{estimate of the}} planet's longitude and its similarity to Adams's estimate, Airy persuaded Challis {{to search for the}} planet. Challis vainly scoured the sky throughout <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1941 the Soviet Union {{decided to}} cease {{production}} of the 152 mm howitzer M1938 (M-10). One of the reasons was the disbanding of the Rifle Corps between <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September</b> 1941 and the consequent removal of the corps artillery. Moreover, all 152mm howitzers were excluded from divisional artillery. As a result, there was no series production of 152mm howitzers during 1942.|$|E
5|$|Moult {{is poorly}} recorded, the only records coming from Sakhalin and Himachal Pradesh. In Sakhalin, moult occurs in <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September,</b> between the {{breeding}} season and migration. In Himachal Pradesh, aviculturalist G. A. Perreau observed captive and wild birds {{and reported that}} they were yellow from December to spring and whitish during the remainder of the year, a pattern which may be atypical.|$|E

5|$|Pattern Recognition is a {{novel by}} science fiction writer William Gibson {{published}} in 2003.

The action takes place in London, Tokyo, and Moscow as Cayce judges {{the effectiveness of a}} proposed corporate symbol and is hired to seek the creators of film clips anonymously posted to the internet.|$|E
5|$|The 42nd Division was {{assembled}} in <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September</b> 1917 at Camp Mills, New York, where its training emphasized open-field combat rather than trench warfare. It sailed in a convoy from Hoboken, New Jersey, for France on 18 October 1917. On 19 December, Mann was replaced as division commander by Major General Charles T. Menoher.|$|E

5|$|Through <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September</b> 1940 the Luftwaffe met the Dowding {{system in}} the Battle of Britain, {{and in spite of}} great effort, failed to defeat Fighter Command. Tizard's letter of 1936 proved prophetic; with their loss during the day, the Luftwaffe moved to a night campaign. The Blitz began in earnest in September.|$|E
5|$|When it {{finishes}} its moult migration, {{this bird}} moults its remiges between <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September,</b> {{which makes it}} unable to fly. This moult is preceded {{by an increase in}} weight. During the moult, the breast muscles atrophy. When the moult is completed, this grebe continues to gain weight, often more than doubling its original weight.|$|E
5|$|Another {{variant of}} the Panzer IV was the Panzerbefehlswagen IV (Pz.Bef.Wg.IV) command tank. This {{conversion}} entailed the installation of additional radio sets, mounting racks, transformers, junction boxes, wiring, antennas and an auxiliary electrical generator. To {{make room for the}} new equipment, ammunition stowage was reduced from 87 to 72 rounds. The vehicle could coordinate with nearby armor, infantry or even aircraft. Seventeen Panzerbefehlswagen were built on Ausf. J chassis in <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September</b> 1944, while another 88 were based on refurbished chassis.|$|E

5|$|At the time, Jeanne was one {{of three}} November hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico; it was the first {{tropical}} cyclone to attain hurricane strength in the Gulf of Mexico during November. The late season storm surprised maritime interests, and two barges broke free from towing vessels. Indirectly, the hurricane produced heavy precipitation that peaked at 23.28inches (591mm) in Key West. Minor beach erosion occurred along the Texas coast, where tides were two to four feet above normal; coastal flooding affected the state, which was heavily impacted by tropical cyclones in <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September.</b> Jeanne caused no deaths.|$|E
5|$|Between <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September</b> 1941, the Hawaiian Division's {{assets were}} reorganized to form two {{divisions}} {{under the new}} Triangular Division TO. Its brigade headquarters were disbanded and the 27th and 35th Infantry regiments {{were assigned to the}} new 25th Infantry Division. Hawaiian Division headquarters was redesignated as Headquarters, 24th Infantry Division on 1 October 1941. The 24th Infantry Division also received the Hawaiian Division's Shoulder Sleeve Insignia, which was approved in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Blackcaps have a {{complete}} moult in their breeding areas in <b>August</b> <b>and</b> <b>September</b> prior to migration. Some birds, typically those migrating the greatest distances, have a further partial moult between December and March. Juveniles replace their loosely structured body feathers with adult plumage, starting earlier, but taking longer to complete, than the adults. Blackcaps breeding {{in the north of}} the range have an earlier and shorter post-juvenile moult than those further south, and cross-breeding of captive birds shows that the timing is genetically controlled.|$|E
