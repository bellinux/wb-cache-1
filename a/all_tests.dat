5|$|On 23 June, Quale {{stated that}} the inspectorate should never have {{approved}} the trains. He {{stated that the}} Sørland Line was extreme in Europe {{in the number of}} curves, and that this gave increased stress on the axles. The tests which were used to approve the trains had been done on the Dovre Line and with a Class 71 set equipped with tilting technology, a class which weighs less than Class 73. He further stated that NSB had controlled only part of the axle and that if proper tests had been made, the fatigue would have been discovered. NSB stated that they had tested the trains on a section of the Dovre Line they considered to be more curvy than the most curvy parts of the Sørland Line. There was also a misunderstanding in the approval, as NSB had said to DNV that the tests on the Dovre Line were not to be considered representative for the Sørland Line, while the inspectorate had the impression that DNV had approved the tests also for the Sørland Line. NSB stated that <b>all</b> <b>tests</b> would be done again before the trains were put back into service.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue fever may {{be confirmed by}} microbiological laboratory testing. This {{can be done by}} virus isolation in cell cultures, nucleic acid detection by PCR, viral antigen detection (such as for NS1) or specific antibodies (serology). Virus isolation and nucleic acid detection are more accurate than antigen detection, but these tests are not widely available due to their greater cost. Detection of NS1 during the febrile phase of a primary infection may be greater than 90% sensitive however is only 60–80% in subsequent infections. <b>All</b> <b>tests</b> may be negative {{in the early stages of}} the disease. PCR and viral antigen detection are more accurate in the first seven days. In 2012 a PCR test was introduced that can run on equipment used to diagnose influenza; this is likely to improve access to PCR-based diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Romania ordered 126 of {{the tanks}} on 14 August 1936 as the R-2 and {{received}} the first 15, which had been diverted from the Czech order, in April–May 1937 to display in a parade. They suffered from numerous teething problems and the Romanians put a hold on production until these issues were resolved. The constantly changing Romanian demands didn't help the situation, but they refused to accept any vehicles until trials were conducted in Romania. Three R-2s were shipped to Romania on 12 July 1938 for the trials, but Skoda knew which one would be chosen and prepared the vehicle well and it passed <b>all</b> <b>tests.</b> After disassembly and checks of the trial tank were completed, the Romanian commission approved the design on 23 August. In the meantime, the initial batch was returned to Skoda to be upgraded to current standards on 28 July. Shipments to Romania began on 1 September with 27 shipped before the Munich Crisis forced the Czechs to hold all remaining tanks in case they were needed. 5 finished tanks and 6 almost-finished tanks were appropriated and shipped to Slovakia although they were quickly returned after the Munich Agreement was signed. The last shipment departed on 22 February 1939.|$|E

25|$|The first {{demonstration}} {{of an electric}} tram in Saint Petersburg occurred on August 22, 1880.

Despite the fact that <b>all</b> <b>tests</b> were successful, Pirotsky's proposal was dismissed {{on the grounds that}} equipping existing tram tracks for electric traction and purchasing or building compatible tram vehicles would be too expensive.|$|E

25|$|However, {{this does}} not mean that there is no further {{development}} in modern physics. The progress of technology over time has led to extremely precise ways of testing the predictions of relativity, and so far it has successfully passed <b>all</b> <b>tests</b> (such as in particle accelerators to test special relativity, and by astronomical observations to test general relativity). In addition, in the theoretical field there is continuing research intended to unite general relativity and quantum theory. The most promising models are string theory and loop quantum gravity. Some variations of those models also predict violations of Lorentz invariance on a very small scale.|$|E
25|$|Jensen {{also argued}} that even if g were {{replaced}} by a model with several intelligences this would change the situation less than expected. He argues that <b>all</b> <b>tests</b> of cognitive ability {{would continue to be}} highly correlated with one another and there would still be a black-white gap on cognitive tests. Hans Eysenck responded to Gould by stating that no psychologist had said that intelligence was an area located in the brain. Eysenck also argued IQ tests were not racist, pointing out that Northeast Asians and Jews both scored higher than non-Jewish Europeans on IQ tests, and this would not please European racists.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the extraterrestrial hypothesis, a variety of possible explanations for flying saucers have been put forward. One {{of the most common}} states that most photos of saucers were hoaxes; cylindrical metal objects such as pie tins, hubcaps and dustbin lids were easy to obtain, and the poor focus seen in UFO images makes the true scale of the object difficult to ascertain. However, some photos and movies were deemed authentic after intensive study. An example was the saucer-like object photographed by farmer Paul Trent near Portland, Oregon in 1950, which passed <b>all</b> <b>tests</b> when studied by the Condon Committee in the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|At Headingley, one of {{the most}} famous of <b>all</b> <b>Tests</b> was played. It was a high-scoring affair, with Washbrook and Edrich making {{hundreds}} in England's first innings, and Harvey - on his debut in Anglo-Australian Tests - making one for Australia. Early on the final day, with the pitch by now helping spin, England declared their second innings, setting Australia to make 404 in 344 minutes. Laker, not yet the force that he would be a few years later, bowled poorly, and there were many fielding lapses. Thus, against all expectation, Australia got the runs with 12 minutes and 7 wickets to spare, with Morris making 182 and Bradman 173 not out.|$|E
25|$|England won the 1890 Ashes Series 2–0, {{with the}} third match of the series being the first Test match to be abandoned. England lost 2–1 in the 1891–92 series, {{although}} England regained the urn the following year. England again won the 1894–95 series, winning 3–2 {{under the leadership of}} Andrew Stoddart. In 1895–96 England played Test South Africa, winning <b>all</b> <b>Tests</b> in the series. The 1899 Ashes series was the first tour where the MCC and the counties appointed a selection committee. There were three active players: Lord Hawke, W. G. Grace and Herbert Bainbridge who was the captain of Warwickshire. Prior to this, England teams for home Tests had been chosen by the club on whose ground the match was to be played. England lost the 1899 Ashes series 1–0, with WG Grace making his final Test appearance in the first match of the series.|$|E
25|$|All uranium {{found on}} earth {{is thought to have}} been {{synthesized}} during a supernova explosion that occurred roughly 5 billion years ago. Even before the laws of quantum mechanics were developed to their present level, the radioactivity of such elements has posed a challenge to determinism due to its unpredictability. One gram of uranium-238, a commonly occurring radioactive substance, contains some 2.5 x 1021 atoms. Each of these atoms are identical and indistinguishable according to <b>all</b> <b>tests</b> known to modern science. Yet about 12600 times a second, one of the atoms in that gram will decay, giving off an alpha particle. The challenge for determinism is to explain why and when decay occurs, since {{it does not seem to}} depend on external stimulus. Indeed, no extant theory of physics makes testable predictions of exactly when any given atom will decay. At best scientists can discover determined probabilities in the form of the element's half life.|$|E

25|$|With the Ashes loss in four {{tests to}} an Australian side touted as {{supposedly}} the worst to ever tour England {{prior to the}} start of the series, the England side entered the fifth test looking demoralised and dejected. The English selectors once again chopped and changed their line-up, including the addition of two new debutants – Michael Atherton, and Devon Malcolm. Despite the series having already been decided, it was the fifth test at Trent Bridge which truly defined the 1989 Ashes series. Having won the toss and confidently decided to bat, Border's charges piled on the runs once again. The opening stand of 329 between Mark Taylor and Geoff Marsh which lasted for nearly four sessions, the highest opening stand in an Ashes test, in any test in England, and the fifth highest partnership for the first wicket in <b>all</b> <b>tests.</b> Their stand allowed Australia to bat throughout day 2 and well into the third, reaching 600 for the second time in the series before declaring their innings closed with 6 wickets down.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, Genie {{performed}} significantly {{below average}} and showed much slower progress on <b>all</b> <b>tests</b> measuring predominantly left-hemisphere tasks. Stephen Krashen wrote that by 2 {{years after the}} first examinations on her mental age Genie's scores on left-hemisphere tasks consistently fell into the 2- to 3-year-old range, only showing an improvement of 1 years. On sequential order tests she consistently scored well below average for someone with a fully intact brain, although she did somewhat better on visual than on auditory tests. The scientists especially noted that she did not start to count until late 1972, and then only in an extremely deliberate and laborious manner. In January 1972 the scientists measured her in the 50th percentile for an 8- to 9-year-old on Raven's Progressive Matrices, although they noted she was outside of the age range of the test's design. Similarly, when the scientists administered Knox Cubes tests in 1973 and 1975 Genie's score improved from the level of a 6-year-old to a 7-year-old, more rapid than her progress with language but significantly slower than that of right hemisphere tasks.|$|E
25|$|In 1931/32 South Africa toured Australia for {{the first}} time since 1910/11, it was {{therefore}} Taylor's first tour of the country. Without the chance of a draw, <b>all</b> <b>Tests</b> in Australia at the time were Timeless, South Africa were whitewashed in the Test series. Part of the reason for this dominance was Don Bradman who scored 806 runs including four centuries. Taylor scored 41 and 47 in the first match at Brisbane and made innings of seven and six in the second at Sydney, South Africa lost both Tests by wide margins. They gained a first innings lead of 160 in the third but still lost, this time by 169 runs, Taylor contributed 11 and 38. His highest innings of the series came in the fourth Test at Adelaide where he scored 78 and 84, in both innings he shared century stands with Bruce Mitchell however Clarrie Grimmett's 14 wickets saw Australia win by ten wickets. In the fifth Test, South Africa made totals of just 36 and 45 and lost by an innings. Taylor was dismissed for a duck in the first innings and made two in the second. The duck was the first since his debut Test, a run of 72 innings which was a then Test record. His series total of 314 runs made him South Africa's second highest scorer behind Mitchell. In the tour as a whole he was also second behind Mitchell, Taylor scored 813 runs with one century against New South Wales.|$|E
