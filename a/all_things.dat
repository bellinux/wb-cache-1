The Upanishads, according to the Vishishtadvaita school, teach individual souls {{to be of the}} same quality as the Brahman, but quantitatively they are distinct.|$|E

Also available as a separate, double CD release, the reissue reproduces Harrison's 2001 liner notes and includes the same five bonus tracks that appeared on the 30th anniversary edition. In addition, the box set's DVD contains the promotional film created for the 2001 reissue.|$|E
5|$|Although Leng {{credits the}} song's two {{acoustic}} guitar parts to Harrison alone, Spizer suggests that guitarist Peter Frampton may have supplied {{one of these}} parts. Playing the bass, as he did on most of <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass, was Klaus Voormann, who would be another to find sanctuary at Friar Park. Harrison offered him refuge from the media in March and April 1971, when reports had Voormann linked to a supposed Beatles offshoot band, along with Harrison, Starr and John Lennon.|$|E

5|$|The first divine act is the {{creation}} of the cosmos, described in several creation myths. They focus on different gods, each of which may act as creator deities. The eight gods of the Ogdoad, who represent the chaos that precedes creation, give birth to the sun god, who establishes order in the newly formed world; Ptah, who embodies thought and creativity, gives form to <b>all</b> <b>things</b> by envisioning and naming them; Atum produces <b>all</b> <b>things</b> as emanations of himself; and Amun, according to the theology promoted by his priesthood, preceded and created the other creator gods. These and other versions of the events of creation were not seen as contradictory. Each gives a different perspective on the complex process by which the organized universe and its many deities emerged from undifferentiated chaos. The period following creation, in which a series of gods rule as kings over the divine society, is the setting for most myths. The gods struggle against the forces of chaos and among each other before withdrawing from the human world and installing the historical kings of Egypt to rule in their place.|$|E

According to the album credits, the location for the recording was the Beatles' Apple Studio in London, although bassist Klaus Voormann has stated that the true venue was Harrison's new home studio, FPSHOT, in Oxfordshire.|$|E
