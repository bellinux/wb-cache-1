40|$|Abstract — Gossip-based {{communication}} protocols are attractive {{in cases where}} <b>absolute</b> <b>delivery</b> guarantees are not required due to their scalability, low overhead, and probabilistically high reliability. In earlier work, a gossip-based protocol known as gravitational gossip was created that allows the selection of quality ratings within subgroups based on workload and information update frequency. This paper presents an improved protocol that adds an adaptive component that matches the actual subgroup communication rates with desired rates coping with network variations by modifying underlying gossip weights. The protocol is designed for use in environments where many information streams are being generated and interest levels vary between nodes in the system. The gossip-based protocol is able to allow subscribers to reduce their expected workload {{in return for a}} reduced information rate. The protocol is a good fit for applications such as military information systems, sensor networks, and rescue operations. Experiments were conducted in order to compare the merits of different adaptation mechanisms. Experimental results show promise for this approach...|$|E
40|$|Papillary {{and surface}} micropuncture {{was used to}} assess the effects of a chronic {{metabolic}} acidosis on the renal tubular handling of ammonium by surface nephrons, juxtamedullary nephrons, and the terminal segment of collecting duct. Rats chronically fed ammonium chloride had an expected decline in arterial pH and bicarbonate concentration associated with a doubling in the amount of ammonium excreted and a decline in urine pH. The glomerular filtration rate and <b>absolute</b> <b>delivery</b> of water and sodium to micropuncture sites of surface and deep nephrons was not measurably altered. Ammonium delivery {{to the end of the}} proximal tubule increased from 853 ± 102 % to 1, 197 ± 142 % (SE) of the filtered load of ammonium after the induction of metabolic acidosis. This increase was due to a rise in tubular fluid ammonium content from 2. 31 ± 0. 23 to 4. 06 ± 0. 28 mM/liter. After the induction of acidosis, absolute and fractional delivery of ammonium ion to the end of the distal tubule was less than to the end of the accessible portion of the proximal tubule. These findings indicate that ammonium is lost in the intervening segment...|$|E
40|$|There are {{presently}} no standards for in vitro research {{dealing with the}} release and delivery of drugs from semisolid dosage forms, largely because of inherent experimental difficulties. Among the problems, it has proven difficult to apply dosage forms to membranes mounted in in vitro diffusion cells in facsimile to {{the manner in which}} the dosage forms are applied clinically. In the present studies, methodology has been developed which allows films with thicknesses approaching clinical dimensions to be spread evenly over silicone rubber membranes. Using methyl p -aminobenzoate as a test permeant and gelled water and water/propylene glycol solvent systems as test vehicles, it has proven possible to spread films as thin as 75 µm, yielding highly reproducible delivery profiles. Using this application technique, it has been shown how the diffusive clearance of drug from films of fixed composition placed over a resistant membrane is dependent on the thickness of application. For a given medium and thickness of application, when the vehicle composition is enriched in propylene glycol, partitioning into the membrane is suppressed, resulting in a lessening of the absolute rate of delivery and, consequently, a prolongation of the period over which drug is released. Increasing the membrane's resistance, i. e., increasing the membrane's thickness, likewise slows down the <b>absolute</b> <b>delivery</b> rate, extending the effective period of total clearance of drug from the applied film...|$|E

Secondary adverse events can occur, even in optimal conditions. We describe four patients in whom continuous cerebral microdialysis was performed during transportation to and from the CT Department.

40|$|Prostaglandins {{have been}} {{postulated}} {{to participate in}} the regulation of salt excretion during acute volume expansion. The present papillary and cortical micropuncture studies were designed to examine the effect of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors on segmental chloride transport during hydropenia (with and without meclofenamate) and 10 % volume expansion (with and without both meclofenamate and indomethacin). Both inhibitors significantly decreased the urinary excretion rate of prostaglandins E 2 and F 2 α. Clearance studies on the intact right kidney demonstrated no effect of either agent on glomerular filtration rate, but a significant reduction in chloride excretion during hydropenia and volume expansion was observed. To assess the specific site(s) of enhanced chloride reabsorption, absolute and fractional chloride delivery was measured in the late proximal tubule, thin descending limb of Henle, and the early and late distal tubules. In addition, the fraction of filtered chloride remaining at the base and tip of the papillary collecting duct was compared to that fraction remaining at the superficial late distal tubule. During hydropenia, meclofenamate had no effect on fractional chloride delivery out of the superficial late distal tubule or the juxtamedullary thin descending limb of Henle, but significantly reduced the fraction of chloride delivered {{to the base of the}} papillary collecting duct. During volume expansion, neither meclofenamate nor indomethacin had an effect on <b>absolute</b> chloride <b>delivery</b> out of the proximal tubule or the thin descending limb of Henle. However, <b>absolute</b> chloride <b>delivery</b> to the early distal tubule was significantly reduced, and was associated with a decrease in fractional chloride reabsorption in this segment. Furthermore, the fraction of chloride delivered to the base of the collecting duct was significantly reduced. Fractional reabsorption along the terminal 1 mm of the collecting duct was not altered by either meclofenamate or indomethacin. These results suggest that inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis result in an increase in chloride reabsorption in the superficial loop of Henle, and in segments between the superficial late distal tubule and the base of the collecting duct. The results are consistent with the view that prostaglandins inhibit chloride transport in the thick ascending limb of Henle, and/or the cortical and outer medullary collecting tubule...|$|R

40|$|Papillary {{and surface}} micropuncture {{were used to}} study the {{handling}} of ammonium {{and the formation of}} net acid by surface nephrons, deep nephrons, and the terminal segment of collecting duct (CD) after renal mass was reduced by two-thirds. Net acid excretion by the remnant kidney (RK) was significantly reduced, averaging 794 ± 81 neq/min (SE) compared with 1, 220 ± 105 neq/min after sham operation (P < 0. 001), due to a decrease in ammonium excretion (494 ± 54 vs. 871 ± 79 nmol/min in controls, P < 0. 001). Urinary pH and titratable acid excretion were not different in the two groups of animals. After RK formation, ammonium delivery {{to the end of the}} proximal tubule increased nearly threefold and averaged 66. 2 ± 5. 6 compared with 18. 4 ± 2. 9 pmol/min in controls, (P < 0. 001). This greater delivery of ammonium was primarily due to renal tubule entry rather than to changes in the filtered load and was only partially related to the differences in flow rate. Ammonium processing by deep nephrons was profoundly affected by a reduction in renal mass. Although <b>absolute</b> <b>delivery</b> of ammonium was greater to the bend of Henle's loop (BHL), the difference could be accounted for on the basis of an increase in nephron size. Thus, fractional delivery (FDNH+ 4) to this site was not different for the two groups of animals, averaging 1, 567 ± 180 % in controls and 1, 400 ± 181 % in the group with the RK. Hydrogen secretion in the proximal segments of deep and surface nephrons did not increase in proportion to the decrease in renal mass and as a consequence bicarbonate delivery to the end of the proximal tubule of surface nephrons and to the BHL of deep nephrons was increased...|$|E
40|$|Mineralocorticoid {{plays a role}} in urinary {{acidification}} and acid-base balance, but {{the response}} of the inner medulla to aldosterone has not been elucidated. A model of selective aldosterone deficiency (SAD) with hyperkalemia and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis was employed to assess segmental acidification by measuring in situ pH, titratable acidity (TA) and total ammonia (Am). Hydrogen ion secretion was also examined {{as a function of the}} increment in in situ PCO 2 in the collecting duct during bicarbonate loading. SAD rats were compared to ADX controls that received adrenalectomy and chronic replacement of gluco- and mineralocorticoid and to rats with chronic metabolic acidosis induced by oral NH 4 Cl (CMA). Both fractional and <b>absolute</b> <b>delivery</b> of Am to the loop of Henle was lower in SAD vs. CMA rats (1. 34 to 3. 63 mM, P less than 0. 01). Delivery of Am to the base and tip collecting duct (BCD and TCD) was also markedly lower in SAD (1. 50 vs. 0. 52 and 1. 77 vs. 0. 47 mM, respectively, P less than 0. 01). Net addition of Am and net acid between BCD and TCD, observed in CMA rats, was not observed in SAD despite equivalent degrees of systemic metabolic acidosis. Similarly, the concentration gradient favoring transfer of NH 3 between loop of Henle and CD was reduced in SAD. During bicarbonate loading the increment in PCO 2 at BCD, TCD and in final urine was significantly lower in SAD rats than in adrenal intact bicarbonate-loaded rats. Therefore, the acidification defect in this model of SAD appears to be a result of a decrease in ammonia production and delivery to the loop of Henle, impaired transfer from loop to collecting duct and reduction in the rate of H+ secretion by the collecting duct...|$|E
40|$|Sensor {{networks}} often {{involve the}} monitoring of mobile phenomena, {{which can be}} facilitated by a spatiotemporal multicast protocol we call "mobicast". Mobicast is a novel spatiotemporal multicast protocol featuring a delivery zone that evolves over time. Mobicast can in theory provide <b>absolute</b> spatiotemporal <b>delivery</b> guarantees by limiting communication to a mobile forwarding zone whose size {{is determined by the}} global worst-case value associated with a compactness metric defined over the geometry of the network. In this work, we first studied the compactness properties of sensor networks with uniform distribution. The results of this study motivate three approaches for improving the e#ciency of spatiotemporal multicast in such networks. First, one may achieve high savings on communication overhead by slightly relaxing spatiotemporal delivery guarantees. Second, spatiotemporal multicast may exploit local compactness values for higher e#ciency for networks with non uniform spatial distribution of compactness. Third, for random uniformly distributed sensor network deployment, one may choose a deployment density to best support spatiotemporal communication. We also explored all these directions via mobicast simulation and results are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} excrete an oral water load and the renal {{diluting}} mechanism were studied in hypothyroid rats and in age-matched euthyroid controls. Hypothyroid animals excreted a significantly smaller {{fraction of a}} 50 -ml/kg oral water load than controls, demonstrating the same limited ability to excrete free water as thyroid-deficient man. During hypotonic (0. 45 %) saline infusion, <b>absolute</b> sodium <b>delivery</b> to the diluting segment and free water clearance were markedly lower in hypothyroid rats. However, both fractional distal sodium delivery and fractional free water clearance were similar in hypothyroid and control animals, suggesting that the reduced absolute free water formation in hypothyroid rats was due to decreased net distal delivery. In support of this hypothesis was the observation that fractional distal sodium reabsorption was equal or higher in thyroid-deficient rats, which indicates that the sodium reabsorptive capacity of the diluting segment was preserved in these animals. The results cannot be attributed to incomplete suppression of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) since they were identical in diabetes insipidus rats, nor to different rates of non-ADH-dependent backflux of filtrate since tissue osmolality and solute concentrations in the cortex, medulla, and papilla were similar in hypothyroid and control rats of both Sprague-Dawley and Brattleboro strains...|$|R

40|$|Sodium {{handling}} by deep nephrons and {{the terminal}} collecting duct in glomerulonephritis. The {{present study was}} designed to characterize the effects of anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) glomerulonephritis (GN) on sodium handling by surface nephrons, deep nephrons and the terminal collecting duct segment. Studies were performed in rats during hydropenia and volume expansion. In hydropenia, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and sodium excretion tended to be lower in rats with GN than in controls. However, the major differences between the control and GN animals were seen in volume expansion. In the volume expanded groups fractional excretion of sodium was greater in controls (3. 20 ± 0. 51 %) than in GN (1. 20 ± 0. 36 %, P < 0. 01). Despite this, delivery to end proximal sites was similar in the two groups in absolute terms and higher in the expanded GN group compared to the expanded controls. <b>Absolute</b> sodium <b>delivery</b> to the bend of the loop of Henle in the expanded GN rats was decreased in absolute terms but increased in fractional terms compared to expanded controls. However, fractional delivery of sodium {{to the base of the}} terminal collecting duct was less in GN (3. 71 ± 1. 39 %) than in controls (7. 19 ± 0. 96 %, P < 0. 002). In both groups, fractional delivery between tip of the collecting duct fell compared to base (P < 0. 05) but delivery to the tip was again greater in controls (5. 49 ± 1. 08 %) than in GN (1. 51 ± 0. 47 %). In GN 62. 6 ± 5. 0 % of delivered sodium was reabsorbed between collecting duct sites, nearly twofold that of controls (28. 8 ± 9. 4 %, P < 0. 01). Thus, fractional sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct was enhanced by GN...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{designed}} to compare the segmental analysis of sodium reabsorption along the nephron during volume expansion with either 10 % body weight Ringer's or 0. 6 % body weight hyperoncotic albumin. Total kidney and nephron glomerular filtration rate increased similarly with both, but urinary sodium excretion (12. 7 vs. 4. 0 μeq/min, P < 0. 001) and fractional sodium excretion (5. 0 vs. 1. 6 %, P < 0. 001) increased {{to a greater extent}} with Ringer's. Fractional reabsorption of sodium in the proximal tubule was diminished in both groups but to a significantly greater extent during Ringer's (P < 0. 005). Absolute reabsorption was inhibited only in the Ringer's group. Delivery of filtrate out of the proximal tubule was greater in the Ringer's studies, 45 vs. 37 nl/min (P < 0. 001). However, both fractional and <b>absolute</b> sodium <b>delivery</b> to the early and late distal tubule were not significantly different in the two groups. Fractional reabsorption in the collecting duct decreased from 96 % in hydropenia to 31 % during Ringer's but fell only slightly to 80 % in the albumin studies. Absolute collecting duct reabsorption was also greater in the albumin studies, 0. 55 vs. 0. 21 neq/min (P < 0. 001), which could totally account for the difference in urinary sodium excretion between the two groups. 22 Na recovery in the final urine after end distal microinjections was 71 % during Ringer's infusion and 34 % during albumin (P < 0. 001). From these data we conclude that: (a) Ringer's solution has a greater inhibitory effect on proximal tubular sodium reabsorption, and (b) in spite of this effect, differences in mucosal to serosal collecting duct sodium transport are primarily responsible for the greater natriuresis during Ringer's infusion...|$|R

However, the specificity of these inhibitor peptides is not <b>absolute.</b> Using intracellular <b>delivery</b> to rat CA 1 hippocampal neurons, we have determined the relative potency of two protein kinase inhibitor peptides, PKC-(19 - 36) and [Ala 286]CaMKII-(281 - 302), as inhibitors of the induction of LTP. Both peptides blocked the induction of LTP; however, PKC-(19 - 36) was 30 -fold more potent than [Ala 286]CaMKII-(281 - 302). The relative specificity of PKC-(19 - 36), [Ala 286]CaMKII-(281 - 302), and several other CaMKII peptide analogs for protein kinase inhibition in vitro was also determined. A comparison of the potencies of PKC-(19 - 36) and [Ala 286]CaMKII-(281 - 302) in the physiological assay with their Ki values for protein kinase inhibition in vitro indicates that the blockade of induction of LTP observed for each peptide is attributable to inhibition of PKC...|$|R
40|$|The {{reinforcing}} {{properties of}} orally self-administered drugs {{have been evaluated}} by using choice procedures. The preference for the drug over a nondrug alternative has indicated that the drug has greater value than the nondrug alternative as a reinforcer at some drug concentrations. However, at large drug concentrations, the fluid deliveries of the drug may be equal to or less {{than those of the}} nondrug alternative, whereas the actual drug intake (milligrams per kilogram of body weight) may continue to increase. In this study, we used behavioral economics to evaluate the reinforcing strength of ethanol in conditions where baseline ethanol fluid deliveries were greater than, equal to, or less than those of the concurrently available water. Methods : Four male rhesus monkeys were allowed access to ethanol (2 %, 8 %, or 32 %) and water for 2 hr/day under a fixed ratio (FR) 4 reinforcement schedule. At each ethanol concentration, the FR for both fluids was gradually increased to FR 64. Results : During the FR 4 schedule, the fluid deliveries of ethanol at 2 %, 8 %, and 32 % were greater than, equal to, and less than those of water, respectively. When the FR was increased at 2 % ethanol, fluid deliveries and responding decreased for both the ethanol and water. When the FR was increased at 8 % ethanol, water fluid deliveries and responding decreased more rapidly than did those of ethanol. When the FR was increased at 32 % ethanol, the ethanol fluid deliveries remained the same across all FRs, whereas water fluid deliveries decreased rapidly. At 8 % and 32 % ethanol, the responding for ethanol, relative to water, increased dramatically. Conclusions : In behavioral economic terms, demand for ethanol was more inelastic regardless of whether the ethanol or water maintained more <b>absolute</b> fluid <b>deliveries</b> at baseline FRs. Therefore, researchers should examine the reinforcing effects of ethanol in a variety of concentration and schedule conditions rather than drawing inferences regarding reinforcing effects simply based on a preference measure...|$|R

40|$|Magister Public Health - MPHBackground: The {{factors that}} {{underlie}} teenage pregnancies {{are complex and}} multifactorial. The prevailing perception is that teenage pregnancies are increasing in South Africa. However, the empirical extent and trends in teenage births in the Western Cape Province are not well understood. A systematic analysis of routine health information for the data element. Delivery in facility to women under 18 years for the period 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2012 is presented in order to contribute to documenting and understanding how this problem manifests in the Western Cape Province. Objectives:The objectives {{of the study were}} to describe the trends in the number of deliveries for women under the age of 18 years in the Western Cape Province for the period 1 April 2000 until 31 March 2012, and to compare the trends within and between districts. A secondary aim was to explore the quality and usefulness of Routine Health Information in the Western Cape Province focusing on the dataset for deliveries for women under the age of 18 years. Methods:The data for the Province extracted from the Sinjani system (the data repository for health information management in the Western Cape Department of Health) was subjected to a trend analysis at the Provincial, District and Sub-District level. The absolute numbers of all deliveries, and deliveries for women under the age of 18 years as well as proportions of deliveries for women under the age of 18 years were compared across districts, years and seasons. Results were discussed with senior managers in the Department of Health as compared to performance indicators presented in workshop settings to triangulate and help interpret findings. Findings The key finding is that both the <b>absolute</b> number of <b>deliveries</b> for women under the age of 18 years and the deliveries for women under the age of 18 years relative to all deliveries have declined steadily since 2007, while 8 <b>absolute</b> numbers of <b>deliveries</b> in 2012 were only slightly higher than in 2000 - 2001, despite an increase of 19. 4 % in the total population of the Province between 2002 and 2011. Despite the {{decline in the number of}} deliveries for women under the age of 18 years, the number of deliveries remains high. Seasonal increases in numbers of deliveries coincide with school holidays in most districts. The data analysis also revealed challenges with the quality of the data, and that it is not possible to determine the age distribution of deliveries across women under 18 years from the provincial data set. Routinely collected data do not permit analysis or comparison of births at the ward level where significant socio-economic variations are likely to influence fertility. Conclusions and Recommendations:The data did not support widespread perceptions of rapidly increasing teen births. The declining birth rates and relatively stable proportion of under 18 births relative to all births suggest that adding new indicators throughout the entire routine information system is not justified on public health or economic grounds. However, more detailed and disaggregated evidence is needed to inform locally tailored interventions and could be obtained from alternate sources of information such as point prevalence surveys, annual surveys, or data collection at sentinel sites. While teenage birth rates are not increasing, they remain high. It is recommended that additional service delivery models be explored to ensure that sexual reproductive health services are strengthened and delivered in a manner that would be acceptable to young people. Further, it is recommended that programmatic interventions that target the sexual reproductive health choices made by young people be scaled up in partnership with intersectoral partners and communities in order to mitigate against seasonal increases in the number of deliveries for women under 18 years of age...|$|R

Churchill's recognition to Harding noted a need for a symbol of the wartime Allies. In October 1942, Harding traveled to Washington, DC with six cloth designs. In his meeting at the United States Department of State, he learned that since there was no United Nations committee to present his designs to, he would have to obtain approvals from all 29 signatory nations individually. Upon meeting with Dr. Vladimir Palic, First Secretary of the Czechoslovakian Embassy, a single specific design involving four bars was determined to be the appropriate candidate to put forth. All 29 nations subsequently agreed to the four vertical bar design. However, the flag was determined not to be used as an official emblem of the organization, but rather a symbol of the people and governments. It was flown at Dumbarton Oaks in June 1943 in the presence of United Nations military attaches from all United Nations embassies in full uniform. The Honor flag was also flown throughout Washington at private buildings in August 1943 during the Atlantic Charter week, where it also flew as a secondary flag to national emblems throughout the war. It gradually flew at more and more government offices and was distributed to various of the United Nations, and it was officially adopted in several countries starting with New Zealand. By a motion in the United States Senate, the flag was flown in thousands of towns to celebrate V-E Day. At the United Nations Conference on International Organization, where there was a golden motif, the red bars were substituted with gold, while some nations preferred green and blue bars.|$|R
