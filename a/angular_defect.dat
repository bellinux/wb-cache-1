The study was performed at six Italian universities and 11 private practices. Patients with one-, two-, or three-wall <b>angular</b> <b>defects</b> were enrolled if intrabony defect depth (IBD) was 4 mm or more and probing pocket depth (PPD) was at least 6 mm. They were randomly allocated to either test or control groups. The test group was treated by the simplified papilla preservation (SPP) flap plus Emdogain after root conditioning with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The control group was treated by SPP alone. Plaque Index, Gingival Index, PPD, and periodontal attachment level (PAL) at surgical sites were assessed at the presurgical examination (baseline). IBD was measured intraoperatively after debridement. IBD was also evaluated with a computer-aided technique, from periapical radiographs. Plaque Index, Gingival Index, PPD, PAL, and IBD were assessed at 12 and 24 months postsurgery. Data were further divided in two subgroups according to baseline IBD (6 mm or less and more than 6 mm). The differences between each follow-up and baseline, and between groups at each follow-up, for the above parameters were evaluated by standard statistical methods. One hundred fifty-three patients were recruited, accounting for 195 intrabony defects: 83 patients (108 defects) and 70 patients (87 defects) were allocated to the test and control groups, respectively. All parameters were improved at both 12 and 24 months, compared to baseline in both groups. In the test group, IBD, PPD, and PAL at 12 months were significantly better than these parameters in the control group. The test subgroup with IBD of more than 6 mm at baseline displayed a better outcome {{when compared to the}} 6 mm or less IBD subgroup. No significant adverse events related to the use of Emdogain were reported. The use of EMD as an adjunct to periodontal surgery in the treatment of <b>angular</b> <b>defects</b> significantly enhanced the rate and degree of periodontal regeneration. The control group also displayed significant tissue regeneration, but at a slower rate compared to the Emdogain group.

Material and Methods: From full-mouth radiographic surveys of 146 periodontitis patients (35 years), 194 roots with endodontic posts and contra-laterals without posts were selected. Upper molars, pre-molars with two posts and roots of lower molars with two posts were excluded. Technical parameters of the post space preparation, endodontic and restorative status were evaluated. The level of alveolar bone measured in millimetre from the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) /restoration margin and the pattern of bone loss (angular/horizontal) were evaluated on both mesial and distal aspects of roots with posts and contra-laterals, {{but not on the}} furcal areas of lower molars. Results: The distance from the bone level to the CEJ/restoration margin was similar for teeth with posts and contra-laterals. However, teeth with posts had more <b>angular</b> <b>defects</b> mesially (18. 8 %versus 7. 3 %) as compared with their contra-laterals without posts.

50|$|The {{polyhedron}} can {{be thought}} of as being folded from a sheet of paper (a net for the polyhedron) and it inherits the same geometry as the paper: for every point p within a face of the polyhedron, a sufficiently small open neighborhood of p will be isometric to a subset of the Euclidean plane. The same thing is true even for points on the edges of the polyhedron: they can be modeled locally as a Euclidean plane folded along a line and embedded into three-dimensional space, but the fold does not change the structure of shortest paths along the surface. However, the vertices of the polyhedron have a different distance structure: the neighborhood of a vertex is isometric to the neighborhood of the apex of a cone, formed from a flat sheet of paper with a wedge removed from it by gluing together the cut edges where the wedge was removed. The angle of the wedge that was removed is called the <b>angular</b> <b>defect</b> of the vertex; it is a positive number in the open interval from 0 to 2. Descartes' theorem on total <b>angular</b> <b>defect</b> (a form of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem) states that the sum of the angular defects of all the vertices is always exactly 4.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{critical}} behavior of an N-component ϕ^ 4 -model in hyperbolic space, {{which serves as}} a model of uniform frustration. We find that this model exhibits a second-order phase transition with an unusual magnetization texture that results from the lack of global parallelism in hyperbolic space. <b>Angular</b> <b>defects</b> occur on length scales comparable to the radius of curvature. This phase transition is governed by a new strong curvature fixed point that obeys scaling below the upper critical dimension d_uc= 4. The exponents of this fixed point are given by the leading order terms of the 1 /N expansion. In distinction to flat space no order 1 /N corrections occur. We conclude that the description of many-particle systems in hyperbolic space is a promising avenue to investigate uniform frustration and non-trivial critical behavior within one theoretical approach.

5000|$|The inversive {{distance}} {{has been}} used to define the concept of an inversive-distance circle packing: a collection of circles such that a specified subset of pairs of circles (corresponding to the edges of a planar graph [...] ) have a given inversive distance with respect to each other. This concept generalizes the circle packings described by the circle packing theorem, in which specified pairs of circles are tangent to each other. Although less is known about the existence of inversive distance circle packings than for tangent circle packings, it is known that, when they exist, they can be uniquely specified (up to Möbius transformations) by a given maximal planar graph and set of Euclidean or hyperbolic inversive distances. This rigidity property can be generalized broadly, to Euclidean or hyperbolic metrics on triangulated manifolds with <b>angular</b> <b>defects</b> at their vertices. However, for manifolds with spherical geometry, these packings are no longer unique. In turn, inversive-distance circle packings have been used to construct approximations to conformal mappings.|$|R

40|$|Plaque {{accumulation}} on abutments or implant surfaces induces {{an inflammatory}} {{reaction in the}} gingiva/alveolar mucosa just as around teeth. The longevity of oral implants can be jeopardized by either peri-implantitis and/or an occlusal overload. In the partially edentulous patient in whom pockets around teeth act as a reservoir for the colonization of the pockets around implants, the risk for inflammatory reactions of the peri-implant soft tissues seems especially more plausible than in the fully edentulous patient. This {{is especially true for}} implants with a very rough surface (e. g., plasma-sprayed), because of the positive relationship between surface roughness and supra- as well as subgingival plaque formation. Several medium-term (from 5 to 10 years) clinical studies support this hypothesis, through the observation of ongoing bone loss and subsequent decreasing success/survival percentages. Occlusal overload increases the risk for microfractures at the implant-bone interface in two-stage implants, which can result in significant marginal bone loss and even failure.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a resorbable, semi rigid guided tissue regeneration (GTR) membrane in the treatment of periodontal intraosseous defects. Settings and Design: Randomized controlled clinicoradiological re-entry study. Materials and Methods: Eight patients with bilateral, identical intraosseous defects were selected. The sides for test and control group were randomly allocated to treat either with bioresorbable semi rigid membrane (test group) or open flap debridement (control group). Radiographic analysis was done by comparing intraoral peri apical radiographs taken at baseline and at six months. Extended cone paralleling device with grid was used to standardize radiographs.

Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, ninety <b>angular</b> bony <b>defects</b> in mandibular molars teeth with 5 mm or deeper pocket depth were selected in sixty patients with the diagnosis of chronic periodontitis. Before surgery, bone probing was performed. During the surgery, the vertical distance from cementoenamel junction to the most apical part of bony defect was measured using a Williams probe and this measurements were employed as gold standard. This distance was measured on the panoramic radiographs by a Digital Calliper and Digital Ruler. All data were compare dusing independent samples t-test and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results: No significant difference was found between the results of bone probing and intra-surgical measurements (P = 0. 377). The mean defect depth determined by Digital Caliper and Digital Ruler on panoramic radiographs was significantly less than surgical measurements (P < 0. 001). The correlation between bone probing and surgical measurements in determining the defect depth was strong (r = 0. 98, P < 0. 001).

Conversely, a given net may fold into more than one different convex polyhedron, depending on the angles at which its edges are folded and the choice of which edges to glue together. If a net is given together with a pattern for gluing its edges together, such that each vertex of the resulting shape has positive <b>angular</b> <b>defect</b> and such that the sum of these defects is exactly 4, then there necessarily exists exactly one polyhedron that can be folded from it; this is Alexandrov's uniqueness theorem.

Additionally, the same net may have multiple valid gluing patterns, leading to different folded polyhedra.In 1975, G. C. Shephard asked whether every convex polyhedron has at least one net. This question, which is also known as Dürer's conjecture, or Dürer's unfolding problem, remains unanswered. There exist non-convex polyhedra that do not have nets, and it is possible to subdivide the faces of every convex polyhedron (for instance along a cut locus) so that the set of subdivided faces has a net.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the prevalence of horizontal alveolar bone loss and vertical bone defects in periodontal patients; and later, to correlate it with the treatment modalities available in the literature for horizontal and vertical bone defects. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in two parts. Part I was the radiographic evaluation of 150 orthopantomographs (OPGs) (of patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis and seeking periodontal care), which were digitized and read using the AutoCAD 2006 software. All the periodontitis-affected teeth were categorized as teeth with vertical defects (if the defect angle was &# 8804; 45 &# 176; and defect depth was &# 8805; 3 mm) or as having horizontal bone loss. Part II of the study comprised search of the literature on treatment modalities for horizontal and vertical bone loss in four selected periodontal journals. Results: Out of the 150 OPGs studied, 54 (36 &#x 0025;) OPGs showed one or more vertical defects. Totally, 3, 371 teeth were studied, out of which horizontal bone loss was found in 3, 107 (92. 2 &#x 0025;) teeth, and vertical defects were found only in 264 (7. 8 &#x 0025;) of the teeth, which was statistically significant (P <. 001).
