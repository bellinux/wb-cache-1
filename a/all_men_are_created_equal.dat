25|$|Tensions {{erupted into}} battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when the British {{attempted}} {{to capture and}} destroy Colonial military supplies at Lexington and Concord in April 1775. The conflict then developed into a global war, during which the Patriots (and later their French, Spanish, and Dutch allies) fought the British and Loyalists in {{what became known as}} the American Revolutionary War (1775–83). Each of the thirteen colonies formed a Provincial Congress that assumed power from the old colonial governments and suppressed Loyalism, and from there they built a Continental Army under the leadership of General George Washington. The Continental Congress determined King George's rule to be tyrannical and infringing the colonists' rights as Englishmen, and they declared the colonies free and independent states on July 2, 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy, and they proclaimed that <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>equal.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Senate {{campaign}} {{featured the}} seven Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858, {{the most famous}} political debates in American history. The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that [...] "The Slave Power" [...] was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting {{the values of the}} Founding Fathers that <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>equal,</b> while Douglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine, that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists. The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglas' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Dred Scott decision.|$|E

In 1860, Congressman Laurence M. Keitt of South Carolina said, [...] "The anti-slavery party contend that slavery is wrong in itself, and the Government is a consolidated national democracy. We of the South contend that slavery is right, and that this is a confederate Republic of sovereign States." ...|$|E

[...] Stephen Douglas said that [...] "the negro" [...] Frederick Douglass told [...] "all the friends of negro equality and negro citizenship to rally as one man around Abraham Lincoln." [...] Stephen Douglas also charged Lincoln {{with a lack of}} consistency when speaking on the issue of racial equality, and cited Lincoln's previous statements that the declaration that <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>equal</b> applies to blacks as well as whites.|$|E

2500|$|Inspired {{by these}} words, Bett sought the counsel of Theodore Sedgwick, a young abolition-minded lawyer, {{to help her}} sue for freedom in court. [...] According to Catherine Sedgwick's account, she told him, [...] "I heard that paper read yesterday, that says, <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>equal,</b> and that every man {{has a right to}} freedom. I'm not a dumb critter; won't the law give me my freedom?" [...] After much {{deliberation}} Sedgwick accepted her case, {{as well as that of}} Brom, another of Ashley's slaves.

2500|$|Democracy, social-contract theory, {{separation}} of powers, religious freedom, {{separation of}} church and state – these achievements of the Reformation and early Protestantism were elaborated on and popularized by Enlightenment thinkers. Some of the philosophers of the English, Scottish, German, and Swiss Enlightenment – Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, John Toland, David Hume, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Christian Wolff, Immanuel Kant, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau – had Protestant backgrounds. For example, John Locke, whose political thought was based on [...] "a set of Protestant Christian assumptions", derived the equality of all humans, including the equality of the genders ("Adam and Eve"), from Genesis 1, 26–28. As all persons were created equally free, all governments needed [...] "the consent of the governed."

2500|$|While Locke {{spoke in}} the {{language}} of natural law, the content of this law was by and large protective of natural rights, and it was this language that later liberal thinkers preferred. Political philosopher Jeremy Waldron has pointed out that Locke's political thought was based on [...] "a particular set of Protestant Christian assumptions." [...] To Locke, the content of natural law was identical with biblical ethics as laid down especially in the Decalogue, Christ's teaching and exemplary life, and St. Paul's admonitions. Locke derived the concept of basic human equality, including the equality of the sexes ("Adam and Eve"), from , the starting-point of the theological doctrine of Imago Dei. One of the consequences is that as all humans are created equally free, governments need the consent of the governed. Thomas Jefferson, arguably echoing Locke, appealed to unalienable rights in the Declaration of Independence, [...] "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>equal,</b> that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." [...] The Lockean idea that governments need the consent of the governed was also fundamental to the Declaration of Independence, as the American Revolutionaries used it as justification for their separation from the British crown.|$|E

All decent slaveholders talk that way, and I do not doubt their candour; but they never vote that way. Although in a private letter or {{conversation}} you will express your preference that Kansas should be free, you would vote for no man for Congress who would {{say the same thing}} publicly. No such man could be elected from any district in a slave State. You think Stringfellow and company ought to be hung.... The slave-breeders and slave-traders are a small, odious, and detested class among you; and yet in politics they dictate the course of all of you, and are as completely your masters as you are the master of your own negroes. You inquire where I now stand. That is a disputed point. I think I am a Whig; but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an Abolitionist. When I was at Washington, I voted for the Wilmot Proviso as good as forty times; and I never heard of any one attempting to unwhig me for that. I now do no more than oppose the extension of slavery. I am not a Know-nothing; that is certain. How could I be? How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes be in favour of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we began by declaring that <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>equal.</b> We now practically read it, <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>equal</b> except negroes. When the Know-nothings get control, it will read, <b>all</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>equal</b> except negroes and foreigners and Catholics. When it comes to this, I shall prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty--to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy....
