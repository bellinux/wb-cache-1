500|$|Numerous {{problems}} {{occurred in}} the first race. The leading mushers had to break trail because the snowmobile intended for the task broke down. Trail markers often were absent or misplaced, and no preparations had been made for racers in Dawson City until organizer Roger Williams flew there shortly after the race began. After Dawson City, mushers had their dogs and sleds trucked [...] to avoid a section of snowless trail, then {{had to deal with}} open sections of the Yukon River near Whitehorse due to above-average temperatures. The eventual winner of the inaugural race, Sonny Lindner, was greeted with little fanfare on his arrival. On the race's 25th anniversary, he recalled, [...] "I think it was 90percent (camping) trip <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of racing." ...|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery of MTV News {{said that}} the song seemed [...] "tailor-made" [...] for him, playing on the {{strengths}} {{that led him to}} win American Idol. Montgomery also said, [...] "his husky, broad voice, shuffly guitar playing and genuinely sweet disposition – and wraps them in a well-worn, subtly sexy tune, full of wide-eyed, dare we say inspirational sentiments. Yet, at the same time, it's also incredibly earnest in tone." [...] Misha Berson of the Seattle Times described the song as [...] "surprising, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> jarring at first, if you expected a ballad or a mellow groove with a spare arrangement, like some of Allen's best performances on American Idol that paved the way to his Season 8 win". [...] In spite of Berson's initial surprise at the song's sound, she went on to praise the single as [...] "very catchy, a bit inspirational", and [...] "energetic". She praised the chorus and further commended the song as [...] "a marked improvement over what some Idol winners have put out as their first post-show single".|$|E
500|$|In {{one of the}} few {{contemporaneous}} accounts, the Toledo Blade {{wrote that}} the Penn players, knowing that Schulz was [...] "the power in the Michigan game", focused their energy on wearing him down. [...] There were two Penn players who [...] "did nothing but look after Schultz". [...] And they did more than look: [...] "In every scrimmage, he was bumped as hard as the rules allowed, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> harder, when nobody was looking.... Every time Schultz started anywhere he would find a couple of Penn men digging headfirst into his stomach. [...] They would elbow him, jam him with the straight arm, and if he went to the ground in a scrimmage there generally would be a knee grinding him in the wind. [...] Pretty soon Schultz began to show it.... He limped along pitifully. [...] He couldn't run. [...] His strength was almost gone. [...] When he did tackle, his groan of pain could almost be heard in the stands". [...] But the fans continued to urge Schulz with yells of [...] "G-r-r-r-r-rah, Schultz!" [...] Schulz buckled down and continued to play, and the pummeling continued.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to Bailey's storyline, which she deemed [...] "not surprising", West stated: [...] "He tells Bailey that it's her {{that will eventually}} be Chief when she’s ready. Miranda's reaction could {{only be described as}} shock. While the other residents were running around trying to get information, she was so busy working on the free clinic project that she hadn’t even heard he was retiring." [...] The story of the two Amish girls was deemed [...] "a little side story, which was actually quite touching and well written", being praised for the realistic portrayals and the effects the storyline had on Stevens. [...] "I don't think I've ever realized that Callie and Cristina never really interacted before. When they did speak to one another the episode, their personalities clash right away. At first they were snippy to one another but the two bonded after slicing open a runner's legs and then operating on him.", assessed West, in {{response to}} Torres and Yang's arc, which was described as [...] "an obvious parallel {{to the rest of the}} episode". West compared the reaction of Yang and Torres following the proposals, by noting that the former was [...] "surprised <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit touched", whereas Torres expressed fear and concern: [...] "She's worried that he's only proposing because he's still getting over the loss of his dad and just needs someone to cling to. I adore George, but he's a mess right now and needs to get stuff straightened out before he makes any lifelong commitments." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amberian Dawn {{classified}} {{themselves as}} [...] "melodic, dramatic and powerful metal with female classical vocals," [...] and ex-lead singer Heidi Parviainen has called their music [...] "fast tempo, guitar driven metal with purely classical female vocals", while several other sources classify them as symphonic power metal, which the band has agreed sums it up, but {{also points out}} that there are many different styles that vary from song to song. In a September 2010 interview, Seppälä defines their music: [...] "Amberian Dawn's music is melodic metal, and the roots lie in the Metal and Rock music of the 70s and 80s <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of the '90s. There are a lot of technical skills within the band, so everyone who's not scared of serious guitar and keyboard shredding should listen to our music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anderson was cremated, {{following}} a ceremony that brought together hundreds of colleagues, family and fans. Anderson's coffin {{was decorated with}} a floral Thunderbird 2 as his body was taken into the service, where musical scores of the Thunderbirds theme tune and [...] "Aqua Marina" [...] from Stingray were played. Amongst the hundreds in attendance was car owner Melvin Jarvis, who drove to the service in a full-scale replica of Lady Penelope's Rolls-Royce FAB1. Also in attendance was Shane Rimmer, who voiced Scott Tracy in Thunderbirds; he spoke about his time on the show, saying, [...] "It was a truly unique experience. Gerry's office was like the Oval Office at The White House at times, such was the mystique of the place. Thunderbirds really broke a mould as {{it was one of}} the first TV shows that had appeal on both sides of the Atlantic." [...] He also went on to add about the [...] "ground-breaking energy and vision" [...] that Anderson had, going on to say [...] "Gerry was an exceptional man – not only to those who began the studio work with him, and they were all terribly talented and so easy to work with – but also to the hundreds of thousands of young, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> older, viewers who watched that magic flow across television screens all over the world. It was quite mesmerising." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{young fellow}} saw {{the change in}} Uncle Jim's face and quickly {{extended}} his hand, with an apologetic backward shake of his long hair.

I've been so worried thinking of things about MYSELF, <b>and,</b> <b>maybe,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about you, that I quite forgot I hadn't a call to preach to anybody--least of all to you. So we part friends, Uncle Jim, and you too, Uncle Billy, and you'll forget what I said. In fact, I don't know why I spoke at all--only I was passing your claim just now, and wondering how much longer your old sluice-boxes would hold out, and where in thunder you'd get others when they caved in! I reckon that sent me off. That's all, old chap!" ...|$|E

TV Squad writer Joel Keller gave the episode a mostly positive review, but criticized the episode for not reaching its potential. He wrote: [...] "it's {{one of those}} things that's hard to put a finger on; it could be that most of the plots were a series of funny events in search of an ending, but it was mostly because they simply weren't as funny as they could be." ...|$|R

5000|$|Laid Back {{received}} glowing {{reviews from}} music critics {{at the time}} of its release. Rolling Stone reviewer Tony Glover said [...] "Laid Back isn't quite what you'd expect from Gregg's work with the Brothers Band. Instead, it's a moody LP, often tinged with grandeur, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too rich and one-colored in spots. But on the whole, a moving look at another side of a finely charismatic singer/writer."
