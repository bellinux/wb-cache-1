60|$|The Greeks, after {{consultation}} on the subject, {{decided that}} it would be best for them to defend Thessaly, and to take their stand, accordingly, at the Straits of Olympus. They immediately put a large force on board their fleet, armed and equipped for the expedition. This was at the time when Xerxes was just about crossing the Hellespont. The fleet sailed from the port of Athens, passed up through the narrow strait called Euripus, lying between the island of Euboea and the main land, and finally landed at a favorable <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>disembarkation,</b> south <b>of</b> Thessaly. From this point the forces marched to the northward until they reached the Peneus, and then established themselves at the narrowest part of the passage between the mountains, strengthened their position there as much as possible, and awaited the coming of the enemy. The amount of the force was ten thousand men.|$|R

This paper presents a quantitative analysis of three compressed air supply patterns—plant <b>air,</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> use (POU), and local generation—as alternatives for future compressed air usage. Environmental Value systems(EnVS) tools are employed to analyze the economic and environmental performance of the three alternative supply patterns by using cost of ownership and environmental impact matrices.
