50|$|Sujal was a {{very basic}} {{low-cost}} model which used rice-husk ash (produced from heating rice husk in combination with pebbles and cement). <b>Activated</b> <b>silica</b> and carbon {{is present in the}} ash; silica can reduce the turbidity of water, while activated carbon binds with and adsorbs non-polar impurities (such as pesticides and fertilisers). However, the purification system did not have bacteriostatic or bactericidal properties and it was incapable of removing impurities such as lithium, alcohols, ammonia, strong acids and bases or inorganic substances like sodium, lead, iron, arsenic and nitrates. Dr. Muraly Sastry, Chief Scientific Officer of Tata Chemicals, confirmed that even though Sujal could successfully remove the odour, colour and particulate matter from impure water, many pathogens could not be eliminated.|$|E
40|$|Lime {{neutralization}} of acidic drainage is {{the most}} common process to produce an environmentally acceptable effluent. The process involves neutralization, precipitation of metal hydroxides, flocculation, settling and storage of the sludge. The sludge is not entirely stable over the long term due to the natural pH decline in the storage area that can re-solubilize metals. The use of <b>activated</b> <b>silica</b> sol could be an alternative to flocculants in the lime neutralization process. The nature of the metal hydroxide [...] -silica bond could make the sludge more stable on short and long term. It was observed that similar settling characteristics can be obtained with the standard flocculant and a low dosage of <b>activated</b> <b>silica</b> sol. Using <b>activated</b> <b>silica</b> sol, the settling rate is dependent on the concentration of magnesium and iron in the mine effluent. There was an improvement in sludge stability when using a high dosage of <b>activated</b> <b>silica</b> sol. Two mechanisms have a role in the increased stability: the adsorption bond and the buffering capacity of <b>activated</b> <b>silica</b> sol.

First, the precursor, RGO-SiO 2 spherical support, is synthesized through the reaction of thermal reduction with GO-SiO 2 spherical composite at 700  °C in an argon atmosphere to remove residual oxygen groups internally from GO-SiO 2 sandwich structure in the RGO-SiO 2 sandwich structure and <b>activate</b> <b>silica</b> at the same time. Then, it reacts with BuMgCl in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to synthesize Bi support, followed by an excessive TiCl 4 treatment to generate Mg/Ti catalyst component; a portion of component formation happens directly {{on the surface of}} support and other parts pass through the porous architecture into the internal and interact with silica nanoparticles that scattered around the sandwich structure. Then, the supported catalyst is engaged in ethylene polymerization. When ethylene met the active center, the molecular chains of the support surface grow and crystallize quickly in the surrounding of the catalyst, along with the vertical direction of spherical tangent. And the molecular chains of the internal catalytic sites also begin to grow. They filled around the RGO-SiO 2 sandwich structure and has no interaction with graphene; therefore, graphene can disperse uniformly. With the further growing of molecular chains, the volume of polymer granules grows, and it becomes even more difficult to repeat the morphology completely. This is the reason why the nanocomposites are not near-perfect spheres in the SEM shown in Fig.  7, while the polymer has uniform size, good dispersion, and a RGO-SiO 2 sandwich structure.|$|R
