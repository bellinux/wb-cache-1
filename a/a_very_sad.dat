I feel a deep frustration at this new roadblock, as I now have to take a step back and undergo treatment.

I am hopeful that in the near future we will be back on the road again playing music we love.|$|E

500|$|In September 1961, Chapman {{fractured}} {{his knee}} {{when he fell}} at his home. He was taken to hospital for an operation but died on 16 September 1961. The newspapers {{reported that he had}} been ill for a long time; his former wife later commented that [...] "he must have died <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>sad</b> man". Tributes focused on his successes as a cricketer and appealing personality. Summing up Chapman's life, Gibson writes: [...] "But just as a good end can redeem a sad life, so a good life can redeem a sad end, and he had known his hours, his years of glory." [...] Swanton concluded his obituary of Chapman in 1961: [...] "The elderly and the middle-aged will recall him rather in his handsome sunlit youth, the epitome of all that was gay and fine in the game of cricket." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Plugged In criticized Perry's {{decision to}} create an uplifting song about such a serious subject matter as divorce: [...] "Framing the song {{in terms of her}} divorce from Brand, though 'Part of Me', puts a much more somber and serious spin on things. This is no mere breakup. It's the demolition of a marital covenant. So no matter how bad things were in her relationship, no matter how much better she feels now, no matter how cathartic the pulsing beats (courtesy of hitmeisters Max Martin and Dr. Luke) might feel, the ultimate end here is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>sad</b> one indeed." [...] Priya Elan of NME panned the song: 'This is the part of me, that you're never going to take away from me,' [...] "she sings in that strange angry robot voice of hers. The sentiment, as ever, is punch you in face crystal clear and probably meant something to one of the (probably) 17 writers who wrote the song. As it stands, it's another de-humanised slab of radio pop from Perry INC." ...|$|E
500|$|Iger {{subsequently}} contacted Tom Hanks {{to consider}} {{playing the role}} of Walt Disney, which would become the first-ever depiction of Disney in a mainstream film. Hanks accepted the role, viewing it as [...] "an opportunity to play somebody as world-shifting as Picasso or Chaplin". Hanks made several visits to the Walt Disney Family Museum and interviewed some of Disney's former employees and family relatives, including his daughter Diane Disney Miller. The film was subsequently dedicated to Disney Miller, who died shortly before it was released. In April 2012, Emma Thompson entered final negotiations to star as P. L. Travers, after the studio was unable to secure Meryl Streep for the part. Thompson said that the role was the most difficult one that she has played, describing Travers as [...] "a woman of quite eye-watering complexity and contradiction." [...] "She wrote a very good essay on sadness, because she was, in fact, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>sad</b> woman. She'd had a very rough childhood, the alcoholism of her father being part of it and the attempted suicide of her mother being another part of it. I think that she spent her whole life in a state of fundamental inconsolability and hence got a lot done." [...] Colin Farrell, Paul Giamatti, Jason Schwartzman, Bradley Whitford, B. J. Novak, and Ruth Wilson were cast in July 2012.|$|E

500|$|A Bengali by birth, Shankar {{had already}} brought the growing {{humanitarian}} crisis in Bangladesh to Harrison's attention, while {{staying at the}} ex-Beatle's house, Friar Park, earlier in the year. The state formerly known as East Pakistan (and before that, East Bengal) had suffered an estimated 300,000 casualties when the Bhola cyclone hit its shores on 12 November 1970, and the indifference shown by the ruling government in West Pakistan, particularly by President Yahya Khan, was just one reason the Bengali national movement sought independence on 25 March 1971. This declaration resulted in an immediate military crackdown by Khan's troops, and three days later the Bangladesh Liberation War began. By 13 June, details of the systematic massacre of citizens were beginning to emerge internationally via the publication in London's Sunday Times of an article by Anthony Mascarenhas. Along with the torrential rains and intensive flooding that were threatening the passage of millions of refugees into north-eastern India, this news galvanised Shankar into approaching Harrison for help in trying to alleviate the suffering. [...] "I was in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>sad</b> mood, having read all this news," [...] Shankar later told Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "and I said, 'George, this is the situation, I know it doesn't concern you, I know you can't possibly identify.' But while I talked to George he was very deeply moved... and he said, 'Yes, I think I'll {{be able to do}} something.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|On January 29, 1991, Beaird {{announced}} that The Journal would terminate its daily operations {{two months later}} on March 30.

2500|$|FACTNet filed a lawsuit, and on September 14, 1995 a Federal {{judge ruled}} the seizure illegal because it {{violated}} FACTNet's {{right to free}} speech on the internet, and ordered the RTC to return all computers and files that were seized.

[...] Nevertheless, FACTNet states that it has incurred irreparable damage, as the secrecy of its documents had been violated by the RTC. [...] An attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation approved of the Judge's decision in the matter, stating: [...] "They certainly do {{not have the right to}} seize everything and to fish around. There seems to be this thought that things that are contained on a computer aren't subject to the same protections. I think the law is catching up." [...] Helena K. Kobrin a Church of Scientology attorney with the firm Moxon & Kobrin, defended the seizures of the computers, saying after the judge's decision: [...] "The decision yesterday was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>sad</b> day for intellectual property owners and <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>sad</b> day for the Internet." ...|$|E

2500|$|For the score, Giacchino felt no {{pressure}} to align his music with the style or tone of previous MCU films, and [...] "in fact they {{encouraged me to}} go in my direction, so there were never any handcuffs put on me." [...] In regards to the title character, Giacchino felt the key [...] "was getting inside of him—not worrying {{so much about the}} magic stuff, more just thinking about who he was as a person, what he lost and then how that loss affected him. For me it's <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>sad</b> story, {{and a lot of the}} music has this very melancholy feel to it." [...] To particularly differentiate the score, and help create a [...] "mystical mood", Giacchino used a harpsichord and an electric sitar.|$|E

Herman said about the Concerto: [...] " [...] very delicate and <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>sad</b> piece." [...] Stravinsky felt that the jazz musicians would have a hard time with the various time signatures.

[...] In his own original way Stravinsky noticed the massive amount of smoking at the recording session: [...] "the atmosphere looked like Pernod clouded by water."
