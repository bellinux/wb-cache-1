40|$|After {{establishing}} {{an association between}} human resource (HR) practices, organizational performance and employee outcomes, research has increasingly focussed on the processes that shape this association such as the role of AMO theory {{and the effectiveness of}} HR implementation. Another process that has been highlighted by Nishii and colleagues (2008) is role of HR <b>attributions.</b> They explored how employee <b>attributions</b> about why specific HR practices had been implemented affected organizational outcomes. They showed that HR practices attributed to concern for quality and employee enhancement were positively associated, and HR practices attributed to concern for cost minimization and employee exploitation were negatively associated with employee attitudes, unit level organizational citizenship behaviours and customer satisfaction. Union compliance <b>attributions</b> had a neutral impact on outcomes. Nishii et al’s (2008) study focussed on the links between employee <b>attributions,</b> employee attitudes and behaviour and unit level outcomes. What remains unclear and unexplored is how <b>attributions</b> about the purpose of HR practices affects employee well-being. We therefore build on the research of Nishii et al to focus specifically on the association between employee <b>attributions</b> and employee well-being. We hypothesised that quality and employee enhancement <b>attributions</b> and union <b>attributions</b> would be positively associated with well-being and cost minimization and employee exploitation <b>attributions</b> would be negatively associated. Data were collected from 300 airline company workers on <b>attributions</b> and a range of well-being-related outcomes. Our study confirms the 3 factor structure of Nishii et al’s measure of HR <b>attributions.</b> Findings confirm that quality and employee enhancement HR <b>attributions</b> are positively associated with job satisfaction, life satisfaction and engagement and negatively associated with stress. In contrast, cost and employee exploitation HR <b>attributions</b> are associated with lower satisfaction and engagement. Contrary to our hypothesis, union compliance HR <b>attributions</b> among highly unionized technical workers were negatively associated with job satisfaction, engagement and employability. Among low unionized managerial and administrative workers the impact of union compliance <b>attributions</b> on attitudes is neutral. Our study provides empirical support for the usefulness of the construct of HR <b>attributions</b> in understanding the link between HR practices and employee outcomes, confirming that, in addition to the Nishii et al findings of the impact on behaviour and unit level outcomes, <b>attributions</b> affect employee well-being. Our findings also raise questions about the role of external HR <b>attributions,</b> and of union <b>attributions</b> in particular, in shaping employee outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the causal <b>attributions</b> of success and failure in a football match in a group of football players, as well as to investigate the association of the players’ <b>attributions</b> with their level of achievement and the relationships between their causal <b>attributions</b> and affective states. Material and methods. The study involved 75 football players, including 44 players from the first league and 31 players from the third league. The research was carried out using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) by D. M. McNair, M. Lorr, and L. F. Droppleman and a specially designed questionnaire concerning the causal <b>attributions</b> of success and failure. Results. It was found that the football players who participated in the study tended to attribute success to internal causes and failure to external causes. More frequent use of external <b>attributions</b> most likely had an adverse impact on the mood state of the players. Conclusion. Information concerning the <b>attributions</b> that a given player makes can be useful for coaches, as it can help them develop the athlete’s mental abilities more effectively. Beliefs related to <b>attributions</b> can be modified. It is worth considering the benefits of encouraging internal <b>attributions</b> in the case of success and external <b>attributions</b> in situations of failure...|$|R

We examine mothers’ <b>attributions</b> and performance evaluations in conversations about their 5 -year-olds’ (N = 80) success and failure experiences, and connections between conversations and children’s self-evaluations. Conversations differed for success and failure: Mothers were equally likely to make internal-person, internal-process, or external <b>attributions</b> for successes, but were most likely to make an evaluation. For failures, mothers were equally likely to make internal-process or external <b>attributions,</b> or evaluations. Internal-person <b>attributions</b> for success and external <b>attributions</b> were associated with negative self-evaluations. However, children expressed fewer negative self-evaluations when mothers made internal-process <b>attributions</b> for failure, or positively evaluated the success. Results support the experimental literature and extend it to external <b>attributions,</b> which were common in mothers’ framing and linked to negative self-evaluations...|$|R
40|$|The {{dimensionality}} underlying causal <b>attributions</b> to nonacademic behaviors (an accomplishment, an emotion, and an opinion) {{was investigated}} in four studies varying antecedent information (presence or absence) and response format (rating scale or open ended). In the information present conditions, subjects given consensus, distinctiveness, consistency, and incentive information rated the importance of ten causes provided (Study 1) or generated their own causal <b>attributions</b> (Study 3). As Kelley 2 ̆ 7 s (1967, 1973) model predicts, in both studies, high consensus information led to increased external <b>attributions</b> and low consensus to increased internal attributions; high consistency information led to increased stable <b>attributions</b> and low consistency to increased unstable <b>attributions.</b> When globality was considered, high distinctiveness information led to increased specific <b>attributions</b> and low distinctiveness to increased general <b>attributions.</b> Incentive information {{did not have the}} expected influence in Study 1 but the responses in Study 3 indicated that incentive information itself was often given as a 2 ̆ 2 reason 2 ̆ 2 for the behavior. In both studies, the information provided was used selectively and four basic causal schemata were typical of all three target behaviors: stimulus <b>attributions</b> (given high consensus information), personal <b>attributions</b> (given high consistency and low distinctiveness information), circumstantial <b>attributions</b> (given low consistency information), and interactional <b>attributions</b> (given high consistency and high distinctiveness information). Subjects 2 ̆ 7 causal schemata about each target behavior in the absence of specific information cues were investigated in Studies 2 and 4. For accomplishments, the dominant causal <b>attributions</b> were general and internal (person); for emotions, unstable and situation-specific (circumstantial); and for opinions, interactional and qualitatively more reason-like. Principal components analyses of the rating scale data (Studies 1 and 2) yielded Locus, Stability, Intentionality/Controllability (Weiner, 1974, 1979), and Globality (Abramson, Seligman, 2 ̆ 6 Teasdale, 1978) factors (in various combinations) underlying the causal <b>attributions</b> for the three behaviors.
