500|$|Mr. Arakawa <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> {{we would}} go down and simply tell him [...] that we've come {{to tell you to}} your face that we would pay you if we thought we were liable, but we had done our {{homework}} and we were not prepared to pay anything because we hadn't done anything wrong. We just wanted to essentially look him in the face and tell him that. It seemed the honorable thing to do.|$|E
500|$|The son of {{pharmacist}} Walter Pierce and {{his wife}} Julia, Billy Pierce grew up in Highland Park, Michigan, and showed his first interest in baseball at age ten. He recalled: [...] "I refused to have my tonsils removed. My folks offered me a major league baseball and a good glove if I'd have the operation. I took the payola. It really was a thrill to throw around that 'league' ball." [...] After starting out as a first baseman, he switched to pitching to emulate his hero, Detroit Tigers star Tommy Bridges, who like Pierce had a slight build. He attended Highland Park Community High School where his teammates included future major league pitcher Ted Gray, and pitched six shutouts as a junior in 1944, earning the nickname [...] "Mr. Zero". He was the starting and winning pitcher in an East-West All-American Boys' Game sponsored by Esquire magazine, held on August 7, 1944 at the Polo Grounds in New York, with Connie Mack managing Pierce's East All-Stars; one reporter wrote, [...] "His fast ball was amazing {{when one considers that}} he only weighs 140 pounds. In civilian attire he seemed very slender." [...] The West team included catcher and future Hall of Fame center fielder Richie Ashburn, who was hitless in two at bats against Pierce. The game was held as a benefit for World War II community memorials, and two days prior to the event the participating players were guests of Babe Ruth on his weekly radio program. Pierce was voted the game's outstanding player, winning a four-year scholarship to the college of his choice. Detroit Free Press sports editor Dale Stafford, who chaperoned him to New York, later told a fellow writer, [...] "I never saw such a clean-living youngster. On our trip to New York for the East-West game, Billy kept a diary. One morning I found it open to this entry: 'Here it is ten o'clock and Mr. Stafford still hasn't gone to bed.'" [...] Pierce downplayed the experience of pitching in a major league stadium, stating, [...] "I was not nervous at the Polo Grounds, as I've pitched several games in Briggs Stadium back home. I've worked out there with the Tigers, and they, the Red Sox and the Phillies have been interested in me. But my folks <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> I'd make up my mind about playing pro ball after I graduated from high school." [...] After considering studying medicine at the University of Michigan, he signed with his hometown Tigers for a bonus of $15,000.|$|E
2500|$|In the [...] episode [...] "" [...] which guest-starred Kathryn Erbe as Alexandra Eames, it is {{revealed}} that Goren {{has left the}} Major Case Squad. Eames, now working for the City/Federal Homeland Security Task Force, states: [...] "My partner moved on <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> {{it was time for}} a change." [...] Eames has also picked up some of Goren's old habits, such as cocking the head at odd angles when interrogating suspects.|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{this time}} I had got my second wind, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{promptly}} <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> a judicious {{mixture of the}} truth was the thing required.|$|R
6000|$|Somehow I {{had never}} thought of Martyn. He had simply seemed to me a boy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> Anne would be the crown of Clarence's labours. I {{answered}} 'Nonsense; they are both children together!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well"--Rilla {{took the}} plunge--"I'll try, mother--if you'll {{tell me how}} to begin. I have been {{thinking}} it all over <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must be as brave and heroic <b>and</b> unselfish as <b>I</b> can possibly be." ...|$|R
2500|$|In news {{interview}}s, Richter {{talked about}} her love of cooking, sewing and raising children, but she also spoke to her yearning to create art. In an April 1960 interview with Jean Reeves in the Buffalo Evening News titled [...] "Amid Houseful of Distractions, Woman Artist Paints on," [...] Richter said, [...] "All my life I {{wanted to be an}} artist. But I fought against it. I'd stand in front of Dad's paintings and I'd think Why try? But they inspired me, too. But it was a lost cause, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> all I really wanted to do was paint, so why fight it? Painting isn't something I took up as a means of escape from dishes and diapers. The urge to paint was there before any frustration with housework. A serious artist paints because he has to; it's an inborn drive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It’s puzzling,” Jimmy agreed. “There’s {{obviously}} a mystery; but, after talking the thing over, my partners <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> we wouldn’t try to unravel it.” ...|$|E
60|$|I treated {{a second}} time around, and then, to my amazement, Johnny {{redeemed}} himself in that matter of the ten-cent drink. He treated us around from behind the bar, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> he had arithmetically evened things up handsomely.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} it my duty to call today. A new {{proposal}} {{has been made to}} me, which has rather astonished me. It will affect Thomasin greatly; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> it should at least be mentioned to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mrs. Bowen, {{putting her}} hand to her head with a gesture she had; [...] "that would be quite unnecessary. It would be ridiculous under the circumstances. I have thought of it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> the American way is the best." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{everything}} {{turned out}} all right, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> believe Dick {{would never have}} dared to speak up if we hadn't helped things along. But Jacky <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> we will never meddle in an affair of the kind again. It is too hard on the nerves.|$|R
60|$|On this {{particular}} evening, {{for the first}} time since the beginning of the term, I was seized with a prejudice against coffee. I had been sleeping badly for several nights, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> abstention from coffee might remedy this.|$|E
60|$|Before landing, I had the men {{substitute}} soft bullets for the steel-jacketed projectiles {{with which}} their belts and magazines were filled. Thus equipped, we felt upon more even {{terms with the}} tigers, {{but there was no}} sign of the tigers, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> they must be confined to the mainland.|$|E
60|$|Nearly all the German railway {{officials}} have this same craving for tickets. If only they get somebody {{to show them}} a railway-ticket, they are happy. It seemed a harmless weakness of theirs, and B. <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> it would be only kind to humour them in it during our stay.|$|E
60|$|Ernest's tow-coloured head {{went down}} on Laddie's neck again, <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>that</b> there was no use in saying {{anything}} more, proceeded towards the shore, which was {{about a mile from}} Uncle Richard's house. The beach along his farm and for several farms along shore was a lonely, untenanted one, for the fisher-folk all lived two miles further down, at Rowley's Cove. About three hundred yards from the shore was the peculiar formation known as Island Rock. This was a large rock that stood abruptly up out of the water. Below, about the usual water-line, it was seamed and fissured, but its summit rose up in a narrow, flat-topped peak. At low tide twenty feet of it was above water, but at high tide it was six feet and often more under water.|$|R
5000|$|Bravo was celibate for {{the last}} 2 decades of his life, in an {{interview}} for El Mercurio he stated, “That (romantic love) was very complicated for me...I’m too passionate <b>and</b> jealous. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> my paintings <b>and</b> my animals were my best sources of love. I don’t think I’ve had anyone in my bed since I was 50. I got tired of it.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps she didn't know. I've {{only just}} {{got a letter from}} her mother, asking me to paint her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> haven't <b>decided</b> yet <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall do it." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was then}} near noon, and Jerry <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> if {{the captain of}} the boat before us looked like an honest seaman, we would take the chances of telling him so much of our story as might be necessary, rather than run the risk of not finding another craft of the kind.|$|E
60|$|And in {{thinking}} of this I came {{to ask myself}} how we were to present ourselves? Whether as lads who {{wanted to make a}} bargain to supply the fleet with fish, or as recruits? Ponder over it as I might, it was impossible to come to any satisfactory conclusion, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> before committing myself in any way I would ask the advice of my father, whom I was likely to find on some of the vessels belonging to the flotilla.|$|E
60|$|The {{words were}} very simple, {{but there was}} a naïve sincerity about them which made them strangely comforting, while I noticed that Mrs. Leyland, who came in just then, looked at us curiously. I sat out upon the veranda until late that night, filled with a contentment I could not quite understand. To have {{rendered}} some assistance to Beatrice Haldane's sister and won her father's goodwill seemed, however, sufficient ground for satisfaction, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> this must be the cause of it.|$|E
60|$|But I {{could make}} nothing of them, <b>and</b> at last <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> my very haste was {{preventing}} me from solving the mystery. Then I took it more slowly. Again and again my forefinger traced {{the first of}} those four combinations.|$|R
60|$|He {{appeared}} to be a boy after my own heart, entirely different in manners and speech from his father, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> at once <b>that</b> we should be firm friends so long as he might remain on the frontier.|$|R
5000|$|Mayawati his {{successor}} said [...] "Saheb Kanshi Ram <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> we will convert and adopt Buddhism when {{we will get}} [...] "absolute majority" [...] at the Centre. We {{wanted to do this}} because we can make a difference to the religion by taking along with us millions of people. If we convert without power then only we too will be converting. But when you have power you can really create a stir".|$|R
60|$|Because {{our house}} {{was the first to}} be put up in the new village, and, being made of logs, was by far the best shelter, even in {{comparison}} with the tents of cloth, Nathaniel <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> it should be the most homelike, if indeed that could be compassed where were no women to keep things cleanly. I am in doubt as to whether Captain Smith, great traveler and brave adventurer though he was, had even realized that with only men to perform the household duties, there would be much lack of comfort.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{of course}} it will come right in time," [...] said my wife when they were gone, and I agreed that they need only have patience. We had all talked {{ourselves}} into a cheerful frame concerning the affair; we had seen it in its amusing aspects, and laughed about it; and that seemed almost in itself to dispose of Mrs. Bentley's opposition. My wife <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> this could not long continue; that by-and-by she would become tired of it, and this would happen all the sooner if the lovers submitted absolutely, and did nothing to remind her of their submission.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was O-lo-a herself {{who brought}} word {{to me that}} her father had given the {{commands}} that would set in motion the machinery of the temple. A messenger was on his way in search of me to summon me to Ko-tan's presence. To have refused the priesthood once it was offered me by the king would have been to have affronted the temple and the gods--that would have meant death; but if I did not appear before Ko-tan I would not have to refuse anything. O-lo-a <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> I must not appear. It was better to fly, carrying in my bosom a shred of hope, than to remain and, with my priesthood, abandon hope forever.|$|E
6000|$|... "MY DEAR SISTER,--Here am I {{within six}} leagues [say eight or more, twenty-five miles English] of a Sister whom <b>I</b> love; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have to <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> {{it will be}} {{impossible}} to see her, after all!"--Does decide so, accordingly, for reasons known to us.|$|R
5000|$|In 1992, Gramm, {{after having}} {{completed}} {{a stint in}} rehab {{at the end of}} the previous year, became a Born Again Christian [...] "after being tired of the rock 'n' roll life and not feeling very fulfilled ... I was falling prey to some of the bad habits that can go along with <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> my own willpower and strength was not enough, and raised a Catholic Christian, I knew the answer was something deeper for a long time." ...|$|R
60|$|Hercule <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> {{he would}} walk the three leagues into Calais, despite the cold, which was intense, and the blizzard, which was nearly blinding, {{and that he would}} call at the post of {{gendarmerie}} at the city gates, and there see the officer in command and tell him the exact state of the case. It would then be for <b>that</b> officer to <b>decide</b> what was to be done; our responsibility as loyal citizens would be completely covered.|$|R
60|$|Many {{times now}} had we heard this {{reference}} to becoming Galus. Ahm had spoken of it many times. Lys <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> {{it was a}} sort of original religious conviction, {{as much a part of}} them as their instinct for self-preservation--a primal acceptance of a hereafter and a holier state. It was a brilliant theory, but it was all wrong. I know it now, and how far we were from guessing the wonderful, the miraculous, the gigantic truth which even yet I may only guess at--the thing that sets Caspak apart from all the rest of the world far more definitely than her isolated geographical position or her impregnable barrier of giant cliffs. If I could live to return to civilization, I should have meat for the clergy and the layman to chew upon for years--and for the evolutionists, too.|$|E
60|$|I {{afterwards}} had {{cause to}} abuse Trooper Cotton and his errand, but I swung {{myself into the}} saddle, and, when I reached the Bitter Lakes trail, I patrolled it for two long hours under the nipping frost. No lumbering ox-team, however, crawled {{up out of the}} white prairie, though as yet the moon was in the sky; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> the freighter had, as he sometimes did, taken another trail. It then, fortunately, occurred to me that I had promised to inspect some horses with a small rancher living four or five leagues away, and so determined {{to do so in the}} morning. A deserted sod-house stood at no great distance, which the scattered settlers kept supplied with fuel. It served as a convenient half-way shelter for those who must break their long journey to the railroad settlement, and I set out for it at a canter. As I did so the moon dipped, and darkness settled on the prairie.|$|E
6000|$|As soon as I {{got your}} {{circular}} I read it all through from end to end, and I saw {{that all my}} failure in the past had come from my not being organized. I sat and thought a long while <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> I would organize myself. I went right in {{to the house and}} I said to my wife, [...] "Jane, I'm going to organize myself." [...] She said, [...] "Oh, John!"--and not another word, but you should have seen the look on her face. So the next morning I got up early and began to organize myself. It was hard at first but I stuck to it. There were times when I felt as if I couldn't do it. It seemed too hard. But bit by bit I did it and now, thank God, I am organized. I wish all men like me could know the pleasure I feel in being organized." ...|$|E
5000|$|In April 2008, Pete Swanson {{announced}} the band's break up. In an email to Pitchfork Media, Swanson stated [...] "There are no specific reasons why we've {{come to this}} point, but both Gabriel Saloman <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> it's in our best interest to move on from the project. Neither of us have any intention to stop playing music anytime soon, but {{we will not be}} playing or performing with each other again."http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/50041-yellow-swans-break-up The group played their last US show in the city of Chicago.|$|R
40|$|First paragraph: Those {{people who}} know me {{professional}}ly will know that my professional interests lie in psychosocial care, loss, expertise in palliative nursing and end-of-life care both in practice and research terms. However, those {{people who know}} me personally know that I have a particular interest in soaps, serial dramas and celebrity gossip. Indeed, a colleague <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> recently <b>that</b> our Mastermind specialist subject would be Eastenders or Friends. With this in mind and {{in light of the}} European Cancer Conference in Paris this month, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to focus this editorial on cancer and the media...|$|R
2500|$|After {{years apart}} the two reunited {{to write their}} own {{material}} and [...] "create music based around our harmonies {{because that was the}} one thing that people really enjoyed about our performances in the band". Lucas had seen a folk group, Tiddas, performing [...] "Inside My Kitchen" [...] on TV music video program, rage, [...] "t was a revelation for me to see three women singing harmonies, playing acoustic guitar and telling their stories through song. Right then <b>and</b> there <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted to play acoustic guitar, focus on my vocals and write songs".|$|R
