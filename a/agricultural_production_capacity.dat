40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for evaluating the impact of specialization in agriculture on soil carbon balance. The main aims {{of the study were}} (1) to model the impact of long-term changes in agriculture on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks at regional level using the Rothamsted C model (RothC), (2) validate these results by conventional SOC analysis, and (3) to compare impacts of “as was” and “mixed farming system” scenarios on SOC trends. The study area covered 1800 km 2 of Dolnoslaskie province, Poland. The significant changes have occurred in this area since 60 's. The production system has changed from the mixed crop-animal farming to highly specialized crop production. We evaluated two scenarios. The starting point for both scenarios was the situation in 1960 (co-existing low intensity crop and animal production). The scenario S- 1 reflected recorded changes in agriculture, namely slow transition into specialized and more intensive production with progressive simplification of crop rotation and decline in livestock density. Scenario S- 2 constituted hypothetical continuation of the starting situation (i. e. low intensity crop and animal production). In the period 1960 – 2014 SOC accumulation was observed in “as was” scenario (S- 1) in almost all locations of the area characterized by low initial SOC content. The model outputs were then validated using SOC measurements in samples collected in two periods: 1960 – 1970 and 2010 – 2014. The modelled SOC stock explained 56 % of variability of the measured SOC stock. Comparison of S- 1 and S- 2 scenarios revealed that re-introduction of mixed farming with current intensity of <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> has <b>capacity</b> for further increasing SOC stocks in the region. </p...|$|R

In this paper we examine the impact of land fragmentation on the variable production costs of rice farmers in three villages in Jiangxi Province, P. R. China. We find that changes in the number of plots and plot size distribution, as measured by the Simpson index, do not affect total production costs per unit output, but cause a shift between cost categories. Farmers with more and smaller plots tend to use more labor and fewer modern technologies as compared to farmers with fewer and larger plots. Other aspects of land fragmentation, however, do affect total production costs. A reduction of the average distance to plots and an increase in farm size decrease the total production costs per ton.

Local con-tradictions arising from the global food supply model are the issue dealt with in this contribution, with particular reference to Italy.

I find that, while a correlation does exist between ethanol production and crop prices, this correlation is better explained by accompanying changes in oil prices.

The main factor in the reduction of poverty since the mid 1990 s has been increased production in agriculture, the main source by far of livelihoods in the country. However, this growth represents only a ?bounce-back? to pre-war levels of agricultural production, without any substantial improvement in productivity, which remains very low even when compared regionally. Growth in industrial production has been the main driving force behind Mozambique?s rapidly growing exports. Based on a few mega-projects, this growth has, however, created few jobs while its contribution to public revenue has been marginal when compared to its value of production. Due to the enclave character of such projects, the spillover effect in terms of technology transfer or skills development has been minimal.

Does it {{make sense}} to talk about a crisis in {{agriculture}} in one of the world’s wealthiest economies when significant quantities of public money are invested in the agricultural sector? Moreover, should one worry about the robust-ness of food production if it takes place at the margins of economic efficiency and where, consequently, importing food seems the simpler and cheaper option? Should agriculture in marginal areas have any role whatsoever in food produc-tion? Against the backdrop of national and international discourses on the need for increasing food production, this article analyses developments in Northern Norway {{in the aftermath of a}} year of major production crisis. The analysis uses large statistical data sets combined with qualitative information to draw a picture of agriculture in this region.

Land fragmentation is the practice of farming a number of spatially separated plots of owned or rented land by the same farmer and can be seen as common phenomenon in the Macedonian agriculture as well as in many developing countries. Land fragmentation can be seen to have negative effect on agricultural productivity, but it may also provide benefits for farm households. This study was conducted to find out the influence of land fragmentation measured by the number of plots on the value of vegetable produced in the Skopje and Southeastern region in Republic of Macedonia. The analysis uses models such as Cobb-Douglas production function as well as General Linear Model. The findings of the regression estimations supported the negative and statistically significant impact of land fragmentation over productivity and profitability of growing vegetables in the research area.

40|$|In the Tokachi District {{there has}} been an {{astonishing}} increase in the development of large-scale upland farming, especially in the peripheral areas where <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>capacity</b> is lower. Recently, {{there has been}} an increase in number of upland farms that are more than 50 hectares in size. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to illustrate the potential problems associated with expanding the scale of upland farms. The study examined four upland farmers in the Tokachi District. 1) The proportion of cultivated crops relative to farm size has steadily declined in the last ten years. By changing work procedures it is possible to maintain current upland farming land use patterns and the crop rotation system for farms up to 50 hectares in size. When farms reach 70 hectares in size, however, it is very difficult to maintain the crop rotation system without changing work procedures and the combination of cultivated crops. If changes are not made the farmer is forced to perform work at less than optimal times. Expanding upland farming scale to 70 hectares, without a technical foundation, will cause a decrease in land productivity. 2) Enlarging farm size while maintaining the crop rotation system requires an increase in fixed capital expenditures. This in turn raises depreciation costs. The depreciation costs for a 70 -hectare farm are especially high and the depreciation costs per hectare cannot be reduced. In short, economies of scale do not exist in large-scale upland farming. This suggests that fixed machinery costs will not decrease with an increase in farm size. 3) Enlarging farm size, up to 50 hectares, in peripheral areas clearly increases farm income, but at 70 hectares, because of a decrease in land productivity and an increase in depreciation costs, farm income is severely restricted. At 70 hectares the efficiency of farm management decreases and both income ratio and income per acre falls...|$|E
40|$|The {{required}} {{increase in}} agricultural production to meet future food demand will further increase pressure on land resources. Integrative {{indicators of the}} current status of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>capacity</b> of land and their change over time are needed for promoting land management practices to maintain or improve land productivity and a sustainable use of natural resources. It is argued that such land quality indicators should be obtained with a holistic systems-oriented approach. Two land quality indicators are elaborated that deal with (1) yield gaps, i. e. the difference of actual yield and yield obtained under optimum management practices, or yields determined by the land-based natural resources, and (2) a soil nutrient balance, i. e. the rate with which soil fertility is changing. The yield gap is based on the calculation of land-based cereal productivity at three different levels in terms of potential, water limited, and nutrient limited production, considering weather, soil and crop characteristics. These modelled production levels do not incorporate socio-economic aspects, which may impede agricultural management in its effort to release stress because of inadequate soil fertility, water availability and/or occurrence of pests and diseases. Therefore, location specific actual yield levels are also considered. Besides an evaluation of the actual status of the land, {{it is important to consider}} the rate of change. The quantification of changes in soil nutrient stocks is crucial to identify problematic land use systems. The soil nutrient balance, i. e. the net difference between gross inputs and outputs of nutrients to the system, is used as measure for the changes. The indicator for the soil nutrient balance combines this rate of soil nutrient change and the soil nutrient stock. Indicators for yield gaps and soil nutrient balances are defined, procedures for their quantification are described and their general applicability is discussed...|$|E

In addition to the scarcity of resources, their continuous using over the long term, causes the widespread pollution, loss of soil fertility and low <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>capacity,</b> eventually. The main causes of the increase in energy consumption include the increase of world population, limited arable land, low price of fuel and fertilizer and noted increased levels of human life. Attention to limited resources and adverse effects resulting from the appropriate use of different energy sources on human health and the environment, has been required examining the energy consumption patterns and the flows of energy in the agricultural sector. Checking the share of input and output energy in different agricultural ecosystems, with attention to the type of product and the type of materials used in production, can help to identifying defects and play a fundamental role in the sustainable production, optimization of economic system, maintaining reserves of fossil fuels and mitigate air pollution. With this approach, in this present study energy consumption and energy indices for tomato production in Khorasan Razavi were studied. Materials and Methods The energy efficiency of units was analyzed using the stochastic frontier technique (SFA). Energy inputs from two perspectives have also been divided. In the first view of energy inputs, including inputs that have a direct energy (DE) and indirect energy (IDE).

The worldwide demand for purifi ed steviol glyco- sides from stevia is steadily increasing, and it is expected that in the future the <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>capacity</b> will be lower than the market demand. This provides a strong incentive to explore the possibilities to cultivate stevia and to produce leaves and extracts, beyond the traditional production zones. The culti- vation of stevia might represent a formidable opportunity for the growers, in order to diversify the cropping systems and to meet the increasing market demand for high-quality and traceable raw material. In addition, several legislative initiatives, such as the steviol glycosides approval as food additive in several countries, represent favorable factors {{for the development of a}} stevia-based agro-industry. To foster the introduction of this novel species, a signifi cant improvement of its cultivation should be achieved and a modern agronomical blueprint defi ned. It is in fact imperative to develop economically viable and environmentally sustain- able crop production systems through the integration of site-specifi c agronomic techniques and effi cient mechanization technologies for the production and processing of a higher quality product. Several agronomic aspects require still to be optimized (e. g., choice of the cultivar, propagation and transplanting, sustainable weed management, nutrition, irrigation, harvesting), in order to improve, not only the leaf yield but also its quality in terms of steviol glycosides and bioactive compounds. Traceability and crop quality control along the pro- duction chain are the strongest points, in order to obtain a certifi cation that will provide to the farmers preferential market access and to sell the raw material at a differential price.

This active change is mainly due to the upgrading of the industrial structure. The {{first part of this}} thesis mainly described the gradual changes in China’s industrial structure. The adjustment after 1978 can be divided into 5 stages. The first stage was from 1978 to 1984. The focus point of adjustment in this period was to develop primary industry to release the food stress. Among the three main industries, the government gave top priority to primary industry and light and textile industry and promoted the development of infrastructure and basic industry. As to the internal structure of primary industry, the government provided fund and policy support to encourage farmers to engage in forestry, animal-breeding and fishery. The second stage was from 1985 to 1992. The main task in this period was to develop non-agricultural industries. For primary industry, the most important policy was to promote the development of labor and skill intensive industry and the ratio of crops farming still kept the downtrend. For secondary industry, {{the main part of the}} structure was changed from raw material industry to processing and assembly industry. The light industry still got the priority to develop comparing to the heavy industry in this period. For tertiary industry, the government gave priority to transportation and communication and new industry was highly valued. The third stage was from 1993 to 2000. The dominant position of secondary industry was reestablished and strengthened in this stage. The notable feature of this period was that the ratio of secondary industry increased rapidly with the strengthening of the construction of infrastructure industry such as energy, transportation and communication. The government made policy to proceed with the construction of infrastructure of energy, transport and communication. Industrial departments such as electricity, steel, machinery, motor, shipbuilding, chemical, electronics, building materials became the main driving force of national economic development. In the urban areas, the development of business and catering service industry was preceeded. In the rural areas, policies were made according to their local circumstances and combined with the industrialization of agriculture and the construction of small towns. The regional imbalance also got improvement. The fourth stage was from 2001 to 2005. The tenth five-year plan was carried out in this period and it was the most important period for the strategic adjustment of economic structure. The main guide-line was that the fundamental position of primary industry should be strengthened and the comprehensive development of rural economy should be promoted. The overall quality and international competitiveness of China’s secondary industry, which was market-oriented and took enterprises as the main bodies, were improved by the technological development. The great development of social production capacity was gained by the stimulation of information to industrialization. The quality and efficiency of traditional service industries such as commerce, transportation and municipal service were transformed by the use of modern management methods and service technology. The fifth stage was from 2006 to now. The eleventh five-year plan was carried out during this period. The main policies here were to take the development of comprehensive <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>capacity</b> as the primary task, to change the growth mode and to strengthen its fundamental position. The main requirements of new-style industrialization were to adjust the production structure, the organizational structure of enterprises and industrial layout so that the overall technical level and competitiveness could be improved. The government tried their best to promote the coordinated regional development and reduce the energy consumption. The second part of this thesis compared China with India in the aspect of changes in industrial structure. China and India are neighbors and have many similarities in the aspect of national basic conditions. They both have a large population and a weak economic background. They were almost at the same starting line in the process of industrialization and social and economic modernization. Although China and India adopted similar economic development strategy at the begining of their national independence, their industrial structures differed greatly. China followed the traditional path of industrialization that was following the procedure of primary-secondary-tertiary and took secondary industry especially manufacturing industry as the core of economic development at the present stage. India’s economic growth pattern was quite different from other countries in Asia especially China. It mainly relied on domestic market instead of export, on consumption instead of investment, on tertiary industry instead of secondary industry, on high technology instead of low-skilled manufacturing. India’s service industry played a very important role in Indian economic growth...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe rain-fed {{agriculture}} {{system is}} vulnerable to climate change impact. However, such impact may also vary by aggregate and sub-sectoral levels of <b>agricultural</b> <b>production.</b> The impact of climate change and variability on <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> would engender appropriate policies and practices towards a sustainable <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> system. We investigated the differential impacts of rainfall and irrigation on <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> in Nigeria, and drew lessons for climate-smart agriculture (CSA) in Nigeria. Using time series data that spanned 43 years and econometric analytical technique, we quantified the differential impacts of rainfall and irrigation on aggregate production and sub-sectors (all crops, staples, livestock, fisheries and forestry). Irrigation had positive and significant impact on aggregate <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> {{as well as all}} sub-sectors of agriculture. These findings suggest the need for the minimization of the impact of climate-induced production risks through CSA which would involve complementary development of more arable land areas under irrigation in Nigeria. Irrigation would also enhance complementary agricultural water management for the development of all the sub-sectors of agriculture, thereby enhancing food security and sustainable <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> under prevailing climate change and variability...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} gender dimensions of labor migration and <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> among farm households in Red River Delta region of Vietnam. Through surveying 215 households in Bac Ninh province, the paper explores impacts of {{female and male}} migration on <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> and its implications on rural development. The results show that in comparison to male migration household, the female one tends to focus on <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> by taking the opportunities to rent more land (26. 3 %) and effective use their own allocated land for <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> (97. 4 %). The overall impacts of migration on <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> are the aging of farm labor force (49. 6 year old in average) and higher female participation in <b>agricultural</b> <b>production.</b> The findings suggest that female migrants have a greater contribution in agriculture production both in term of working time and agricultural capital investment while male migrants enhance household income by accumulating capital outside agriculture. Through the gender lens, this research emphasizes the duality {{in the nature of}} migrant lives and the implications of rural labor migration on the fixed categories. Peer reviewe...|$|R
