40|$|Background: Maxadilan, {{isolated}} from the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis, is a potent vasodilator peptide which activates the mammalian PAC 1 receptor. Therefore, maxadilan has been proposed as a targetengagement tool to study PAC 1 antagonists. Objectives: (1) To determine, as a first in man study, the dose response, safety and time course of the dermal blood flow (DBF) after intradermal (ID) injections of maxadilan in the human forearm and (2) to assess the inter-arm and inter-period reproducibility of this response, as measured with Laser Doppler Imaging (LDI). Results: Maxadilan {{was found to be}} safe based on AE reporting, ECG, vital signs, physical examination and safety laboratory <b>assessments.</b> <b>ID</b> maxadilan (0. 9, 3 and 10 ng) produced a robust increase in DBF compared to baseline and placebo. Forearm DBF response to 0. 9 ng ID injections of maxadilan in healthy male volunteers was reproducible between periods (Concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) > 0. 7) and between arms (CCC> 0. 7) when data were calculated as AUC 0 – 180 min (perfusion units* min). An increase in DBF was observed from 5 minutes until 72 hours after maxadilan injection compared to baseline and placebo. Sixty minutes after ID maxadilan,DBF response was stable and reached a plateau-phase. Sample size calculations based on maxadilan-induced DBF responses show that samples of approximately 10 subjects are sufficient to detect a 50 % difference between 2 independent groups with 80 % power. Conclusion: As intradermal injections of maxadilan induce reproducible changes in dermal blood flow, it is an attractive target-engagement biomarker for the study of PAC 1 receptor antagonists in early clinical development studies. status: publishe...|$|R

An increase in DBF was observed already 5 minutes after maxadilan injection and reached a plateau-phase after 60 minutes lasting until 72 hours, with an unexpected peak at 24 hours, compared to baseline and placebo. Sample size calculations show that samples of approximately 10 subjects are sufficient to detect a 50 % difference between 2 independent groups with 80 % power. Conclusion: As intradermal injections of maxadilan induce reproducible changes in dermal blood flow, it is an appealing new target-engagement biomarker for the study of PAC 1 receptor antagonists in early clinical development studies.

Ongoing assessment of neurocognitive outcomes for this cohort is important as a previous surgical era at our center found a higher than expected rate of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Neufeld et al. 2008). Approximately 11  % of children had an Intellectual Disability (ID) and 5.5  % had an Autism Spectrum Disorder (Neufeld et al. 2008). Previous studies have also found increased rates of deficits in Executive Function and in symptoms of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (Bellinger et al. 2003).

40|$|Patients with {{schizophrenia}} elicit several clinical features, such as psychotic symptoms, cognitive impairment, {{and subtle}} decline of intelligence. The latter two features become evident around {{the onset of}} the illness, although they may exist even before the disease onset in a substantial proportion of cases. Here, we review the literature concerning intelligence decline (ID) during the progression of schizophrenia. ID can be estimated by comparing premorbid and current intellectual quotient (IQ) by means of the Adult Reading Test and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), respectively. For the purpose of brief assessment, we have recently developed the WAIS-Short Form, which consists of Similarities and Symbol Search and well reflects functional outcomes. According to the degree of ID, patients were classified into three distinct subgroups; deteriorated, preserved, and compromised groups. Patients who show deteriorated IQ (deteriorated group) elicit ID from a premorbid level (≥ 10 -point difference between current and premorbid IQ), while patients who show preserved or compromised IQ do not show such decline ( 90 or below 90, respectively. We have recently shown the distribution of ID in a large cohort of schizophrenia patients. Consistent with previous studies, approximately 30 % of schizophrenia patients had a decline of less than 10 points, i. e., normal intellectual performance. In contrast, approximately 70 % of patients showed deterioration of IQ. These results indicate that there is a subgroup of schizophrenia patients who have mild or minimal intellectual deficits, following {{the onset of the}} disorder. Therefore, a careful <b>assessment</b> of <b>ID</b> is important in identifying appropriate interventions, including medications, cognitive remediation, and social/community services...|$|R
40|$|Background Most {{existing}} olfactory identification (ID) {{tests have}} the primary aim of diagnosing clinical olfactory dysfunction, thereby rendering them sub-optimal for experimental settings where {{the aim is}} to detect differences in healthy subjects’ odor ID abilities. Materials and methods We have developed an extended version of the olfactory ID subtest of the Sniffin’ Sticks test battery to better assess the variability in ID scores and thereby olfactory abilities of healthy, adult individuals. Twenty-four odorants, corresponding cue labels, and distractor labels were added to the existing 16 -item Sniffin’ Sticks ID test to create the 40 -item Monell Extended Sniffin’ Sticks Identification Test (MONEX- 40). The MONEX- 40 was administered to 259 healthy young subjects, of which 72 were retested on an average of 212 days (SD 112 days) later. Results The added odor items demonstrated good validity, as shown by a significant correlation of the results with the original 16 -item ID test. In addition, the MONEX- 40 achieved a significant test–retest and split-half reliability. Conclusions Taken together, these results suggest that the MONEX- 40 is a reliable method for experimental <b>assessment</b> of odor <b>ID</b> ability in healthy, young individuals. Moreover, its use of a wider range of odors allows the experimenter to present subsets of the MONEX- 40 within the same experiment while maintaining statistical power...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Adaptive {{behaviour}} {{has become}} increasingly important {{in the assessment of}} intellectual disabilities (ID), but is also useful in terms of developing individual behavioural goals. Although measures of adaptive behaviour are widely used, there is little agreement on how to conceptualise the construct and how this may vary cross-culturally. Researchers have previously noted methodological and validity difficulties with the <b>assessment</b> of <b>ID.</b> This research aimed to clarify the construct of adaptive behaviour and consider how to measure this with d/Deaf adults with suspected ID. Methods A systematic literature review, identification of critique of current measures, and gaps within the literature formed the structure of a new item pool. An expert panel (N = 13) were consulted about the usefulness and relevance of these items through a Delphi consensus methodology. Based on the feedback obtained throughout the research process, the design was modified from pursuing a statistics-driven approach to item refinement, to using mixed-methods to clarify issues of construct validity before the content could be further addressed. The second round of the Delphi comprised a feedback report, concluding with a working definition of adaptive behaviour. Participants were asked to comment upon the findings, and provide additional responses to develop a normal base standard of adaptability of a Deaf adult of average functioning. Results The first round of the Delphi consensus yielded wide variation in item ratings. A thematic analysis of the questionnaire comments identified two overarching themes related {{to the way in which}} adaptive behaviour was conceptualised: ‘structure’ and ‘content’. The theme of structure contained sub-themes of ‘assessment’, ‘language’, and ‘repetition’ which are arguably common to all psychometric development. The ‘content’ factors pertained to ‘accessibility’, ‘developmental factors’, and ‘cultural differences’, highlighting differences in the expression of adaptive behaviour based on the unique experiences of d/Deaf people. The second round of the Delphi procedure elicited feedback on a working definition of adaptive behaviour generated from the analysis, showing that the adaptive behaviour of d/Deaf people may be conceptualised differently, particularly in hearing contexts where there are differential communication demands. These research findings have been summarised to form initial guidelines for the assessment of adaptive behaviour in Deaf people. Discussion This research provided some insight into how adaptive behaviour may be measured with Deaf people. Limitations of this research included not being able to generate consensus through the Delphi methodology used and, due to the newly developed understanding of adaptability for this population advanced throughout the research process, it was not possible to subject the items from the proposed scale to further psychometric testing. However, recommendations for further research were made in terms of expanding and validating this preliminary work with a sample of Deaf adults. Word count: 49...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to gather {{strategies}} and factors from tourism security professionals from which terrorism risk management policies can be developed. This study utilized the Delphi method in order to provide structure for the group process. Twelve tourism security experts made up the panel completing three rounds of questionnaires via the email based Delphi technique. This research identified fifty-four strategies to reduce the propensity of terror attack at a tourism venue. Those strategies were divided into four levels of priority based on criticality and feasibility. The fifty-four strategies were grouped into nine subordinate categories. The subordinate categories were related to Training, Communications/ Liaison, Planning/ <b>Assessment,</b> Background Checks, <b>ID</b> Badges/ Secure Entrance, Specialty Security Units, Architectural Design, Media Cooperation, and Technology Based strategies. Alongside the strategies are a collection of comments by the experts regarding strengths, weaknesses, and any barriers to implementation pertaining to the individual strategy. Tourism risk managers, security personnel, and insurance underwriters can all use the results in reducing the opportunity for a terrorist attack at a tourism venue. Major research findings from this study included: 1. The strategy receiving the highest criticality ranking over all other strategies involves training first responders on their role in circumventing the success of terrorists. 2. The subordinate category Communication/ Liaison contains the largest number of strategies indicating the significance of this category among experts. 3. The subordinate category of Specialty Security Units contains the second highest number of strategies indicating the importance of the topic among experts. 4. All of the technology based strategies fell into the lowest priority level. Based on the findings of this study, researcher recommendations include: 1. The guidelines developed in this study should be used by operators of tourism venues to make the best use of limited resources. 2. National or international conferences should be established to further discuss these issues. 3. A greater number of communications mediums should be established to facilitate the exchange of ideas and experiences between affected professionals. 4. Insurance providers should use this information to establish validated guidelines so that, if prospective clients adhered to the recommendations, a reduction in premiums could be offered. 5. Other entities may benefit from this study, such as public school systems, the energy production industry, hospital systems, and pipeline systems...|$|R
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis is the {{assessment}} of Intellectual Disabilities (ID) within the UK prison service. ID is characterised by deficits in intellectual ability, such as reasoning, problem solving and understanding new or complex information (impaired intelligence), deficits in adaptive functioning (AF), which reduce the individual’s ability to function independently within their social environment, and these deficits begin before adulthood (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) - 5, APA, 2013). It {{is important to note}} that the assessments at the centre of this thesis are based on the English prison system definition of ID; IQ below 80. This is in contrast to the internationally recognised and accepted definition of ID defined as an IQ less than 70 (although this criteria has been removed from the most recent DSM, the DSM- 5 (APA, 2013)). The prison service definition of ID using an IQ of below 80 includes those with IQ in the borderline range for determining ID, for which the Becoming New Me (BNM) treatment programme is suitable for, in addition to those with an IQ less than 70. This thesis comprises three empirical studies that focussed on improving the current <b>assessment</b> of <b>ID</b> (as defined by the prison service as having an IQ less than 80) within the UK prison service. All of the studies employed quantitative methodologies and participants were recruited from a UK prison for sex offenders. The first study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of a new IQ screening measure, the OASys Screening Tool (OASys ST), which was developed by NOMS to replace the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) as an IQ screening measure used to identify individuals with an Intelligence Quotient (IQ) indicative of ID as defined by the UK prison service (below 80). The sample comprised 80 adult male prisoners, whose OASys data was accessed and used to complete the OASys ST. The analysis includes a probabilistic model of the data which was developed to assess the effectiveness of the OASys ST, using IQ data (WASI and WAIS scores) and Treatment Programme (TP) data. A logistic regression was also conducted and, in order to inform item redundancy, pairwise correlations were calculated. The OASys ST was found to be an accurate predictor of whether an individual’s IQ is above or below the threshold of 80; using this cut-off it was possible to classify all the individuals who scored two or less on the OASys ST as above the IQ of 80 threshold and the probability of making a mistake with these classifications was at most 3 %, this rose to 7 % if the cut-off was three and 15 % if the cut-off was four. These individuals could be placed straight onto the CORE sex offending treatment programme without any further IQ testing. As described within this thesis, historically IQ has been the sole criterion relied on for determining treatment suitability within the prison service (Sparrow et al., 2005). However, as shown in the DSM- 5 (APA, 2013), an ID diagnosis requires an assessment of both IQ and AF. There is evidence of poor identification of offenders with ID, including sex offenders, by the Criminal Justice System (CJS) (Banes, 2002; HMIP, 2015) because there is no commonly used process for this identification (Beebee, 2009; HMIP, 2015), since current measures employed to measure AF in the community are inappropriate for use on incarcerated populations (Young, Boccaccini, Conroy, & Lawson, 2007). Previously, Sex Offenders with ID (SOIDs) have been at a disadvantage regarding treatment programmes and supports available, but they have recently been the focus of research and policies, resulting in the creation of the Becoming New Me (BNM) treatment programme which was designed specifically to meet the needs of SOIDs (defined by the prison service as having an IQ less than 80). The existing literature indicates that having a reliably sound AF measure suitable for use within prisons is important in ensuring prisoners are placed onto the most appropriate treatment programme and that adequate supports are implemented in line with the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) (2005). As such, the aim of study two was to develop an adaptive functioning screening measure which will be used alongside measures of IQ to assess ID. The stages employed to develop the new measure are summarised briefly as follows: A conceptual framework of AF was developed via consulting the diagnostic criteria set out in the DSM- 5 (APA, 2013) and by reviewing the current community measures of AF and the ID literature. A sample of 11 prisoner and 11 staff participants took part in interviews about daily life inside prison, the results of which were used to produce the items. Originally 115 items were developed and pre-tested by a sample of experts. Item response theory was utilised to reduce the item pool. Forty-six items were retained in the scale which produced 95 % of the maximum certainty of the original 115 item scale. The scale produced was named the Adaptive Functioning Assessment Tool (AFAT). The AFAT is the first AF assessment tool that is appropriate to use within a prison environment that has been created following a systematic process of scale development, the stages of which are explained in more detail within this thesis. The final study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the new AF measure, the AFAT, to see whether it is a valid and reliable measure of AF that could potentially be rolled out throughout the prison service. The results indicated that the AFAT is a reliable measure of AF; the Cronbach’s alphas for each of the subscales were all above the. 7 level recommended by Nunnally (1978) and all four sub-scales correlated positively with one another, as well as with the full scale AFAT score. Although the reliability levels vary from item to item, an average inter-item correlation of. 91 was obtained, with all the individual correlations exceeding the recommended limit of. 3 (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955). The AFAT was also found to have a good level of validity; by using scores on the AFAT, an accurate prediction could be made on which treatment programme participants’ had been referred for (Chi Squared test residual deviance = 32. 45, p. 05). The AFAT showed a high level of content validity; 40 out of the 46 items were rated as content valid by all experts resulting in an S-CVI of. 87 and the S-CVI-Average was. 96. In an attempt to interpret the test scores on the AFAT, two Latent Class Analyses (LCA) were conducted; one treating the responses as categorical and the other treating the responses as continuous variables. Both analyses revealed three distinct classes of individuals, as expected, reflecting high, medium and low AF groups. The second LCA analysis also revealed two minor classes. The interpretation of each class is described, including how these varying AF levels present themselves among the different classes, including how the different levels of AF are manifested across the four sub-scales constituting the AFAT. The thesis offers an insight into the effectiveness of the OASys ST and also highlights the value in having an AF measure which is important in assessing support needs (HMIP, 2015), determining the most effective treatment programme and informing treatment delivery in line with the Risk Need Responsivity principles (Andrews & Bonta, 2010). The studies offer an original contribution to the knowledge regarding {{the assessment of}} prisoners defined by the prison service as having ID (IQ below 80), since the OASys ST is a new tool, that before this research had yet to receive an evaluation of the psychometric properties other than during the development of the tool itself. The AFAT is the first AF measure that is suitable to be used within a prison setting, which has been developed systematically and been subjected to reliability and validity testing. Both tools have direct implications for the prison service, if adopted by the prison service they are quicker than the current available tools and can be used by non-psychology and non-psychometric trained staff and have both been shown to produce results that can be relied upon. However, because the sample consisted of sex offenders only, and was conducted in a single UK prison, further research and testing is recommended...|$|R
