5|$|A {{number of}} factors can {{potentially}} {{increase the risk of}} developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive <b>alcohol</b> consumption can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported <b>alcohol</b> intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic <b>alcohol</b> users, acute <b>alcohol</b> ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect. For non-chronic <b>alcohol</b> users, acute <b>alcohol</b> consumption had no protective effect.|$|E
5|$|Acamprosate may {{stabilise}} {{the brain}} chemistry that is altered due to <b>alcohol</b> dependence via antagonising {{the actions of}} glutamate, a neurotransmitter which is hyperactive in the post-withdrawal phase. By reducing excessive NMDA activity which occurs {{at the onset of}} <b>alcohol</b> withdrawal, acamprosate can reduce or prevent <b>alcohol</b> withdrawal related neurotoxicity. Acamprosate reduces the risk of relapse amongst <b>alcohol</b> dependent persons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alcohol</b> has a {{long history}} of use and misuse {{throughout}} recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on <b>alcohol.</b> In some ancient cultures <b>alcohol</b> was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive <b>alcohol</b> misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic <b>alcohol</b> misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of <b>alcohol</b> abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed prohibition of <b>alcohol</b> being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 <b>alcohol</b> dependence and abuse was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more than cancer and obesity.|$|E

5|$|Alcoholism, {{also known}} as <b>alcohol</b> use {{disorder}} (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of <b>alcohol</b> that results in mental or physical health problems. It was previously divided into two types: <b>alcohol</b> abuse and <b>alcohol</b> dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when {{two or more of}} the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking <b>alcohol</b> takes up a great deal of time, <b>alcohol</b> is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and <b>alcohol</b> tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. <b>Alcohol</b> use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal <b>alcohol</b> spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men.|$|E

5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} <b>alcohol</b> {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to <b>alcohol</b> consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive <b>alcohol</b> use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of <b>alcohol</b> on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by <b>alcohol</b> abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in <b>alcohol</b> abusers. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during <b>alcohol</b> withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by <b>alcohol</b> misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen {{as a direct result of}} long-term <b>alcohol</b> misuse.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{investigating}} {{effects of}} the menstrual cycle on <b>alcohol</b> consumption have found mixed evidence.

5|$|The World Health Organization, the European Union {{and other}} {{regional}} bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed <b>alcohol</b> policies {{in order to}} reduce the harm of alcoholism.

Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as <b>alcohol</b> can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of <b>alcohol</b> has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of <b>alcohol</b> dependence and abuse. Credible, evidence based educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of <b>alcohol</b> abuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent <b>alcohol</b> abuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.|$|E

5|$|The main active {{ingredient}} of beer is <b>alcohol,</b> and therefore, {{the health effects}} of <b>alcohol</b> apply to beer. Consumption of small quantities of <b>alcohol</b> (less than one drink in women and two in men) is associated with a decreased risk of cardiac disease, stroke and diabetes mellitus.

5|$|Women develop {{long-term}} {{complications of}} <b>alcohol</b> dependence {{more rapidly than}} do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men. Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to {{have a negative effect on}} reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as anovulation, decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the menstrual cycle, and early menopause. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse <b>alcohol</b> and have a recent history of binge drinking. The amount of <b>alcohol</b> that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of <b>alcohol</b> consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood <b>alcohol</b> concentrations (BACs), since women generally have a higher percentage of body fat and therefore a lower volume of distribution for <b>alcohol</b> than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize <b>alcohol</b> more quickly.|$|E

5|$|<b>Alcohol</b> {{detoxification}} or 'detox' for alcoholics is {{an abrupt}} stop of <b>alcohol</b> drinking {{coupled with the}} substitution of drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that have similar effects to prevent <b>alcohol</b> withdrawal.

Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome {{as well as those}} who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for <b>alcohol</b> dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse. Some symptoms of <b>alcohol</b> withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations.
