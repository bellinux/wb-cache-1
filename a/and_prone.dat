5|$|All colors {{other than}} Appaloosa are allowed for registration. Welara Sport Ponies {{may be of}} any color or size, without the {{restrictions}} of the purebred Welara. The mix of Arabian and Welsh blood gives the breed refinement, spirit and hardiness, as well as good movement. The head is small and slightly , the neck is arched (<b>and</b> <b>prone</b> to be cresty in stallions). The shoulders and croup are long and the back short. Welaras are used mainly in English riding, especially in hunter classes. They are also seen in show jumping, three-day eventing, pleasure driving and as general leisure riding horses. Welara/Thoroughbred crosses are popular mounts for riders competing in hunter and jumper classes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Clydesdale blood {{was added to}} the Irish draught breed in an attempt to improve and reinvigorate that declining breed. However, these efforts were not seen as successful, as Irish Draught breeders thought the Clydesdale blood made their horses coarser <b>and</b> <b>prone</b> to lower leg defaults. The Clydesdale was {{instrumental}} {{in the creation of the}} Gypsy Vanner horse, developed in Great Britain. The Clydesdale, along with other draught breeds, was also used to create the Australian Draught Horse. In the early 20th century, they were often crossed with Dales ponies, creating mid-sized draught horses useful for pulling commercial wagons and military artillery.|$|E

Although the older Irish grandmothers and gay men who volunteered were plentiful and happy to send out mass mailings, Milk's notes and volunteer lists were kept on scrap papers. Any time the campaign required funds, the money came from the cash register without any consideration for accounting. The campaign manager's assistant was an 11-year-old neighborhood girl. Milk himself was hyperactive <b>and</b> <b>prone</b> to fantastic outbursts of temper, only to recover quickly and shout excitedly about something else.

However, the midgets were still difficult to control, unstable, <b>and</b> <b>prone</b> to surfacing or diving uncontrollably. These manoeuvrability issues contributed to M-14s entanglement in the anti-submarine net, and the repeated detection of M-21 and M-24.|$|E

The west tends to be wetter on average <b>and</b> <b>prone</b> to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months.

The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas. Munster, in the south, records the least snow whereas Ulster, in the north, records the most.|$|E
5|$|Senator McCarthy's {{first three}} years in the Senate were unremarkable. McCarthy was a popular speaker, invited by many {{different}} organizations, covering a wide range of topics. His aides and many in the Washington social circle described him as charming and friendly, and he was a popular guest at cocktail parties. He was far less well liked among fellow senators, however, who found him quick-tempered <b>and</b> <b>prone</b> to impatience and even rage.

5|$|The Greek city-states of Athens and Eretria had {{supported}} the unsuccessful Ionian Revolt against the Persian Empire of Darius I in 499–494BC. The Persian Empire was still relatively young <b>and</b> <b>prone</b> to revolts by its subject peoples. Moreover, Darius was an usurper {{and had to}} spend considerable time putting down revolts against his rule. The Ionian Revolt threatened the integrity of his empire, and he thus vowed to punish those involved (especially those not already part of the empire). Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebuilding}} solved most of {{the maintenance}} problems whilst retaining the excellent features of the original design. Repair costs were reduced by up to 60%, and coal consumption was reduced by up to 8.4%.

5|$|In 1776, Father Junípero Serra founded Mission San Juan Capistrano {{on a site}} {{close to}} the creek (possibly near the Cañada Gobernadora confluence), and the creek was named after the mission. The first site was {{abandoned}} {{due to lack of}} water, although some historical accounts suggest the creek once had a perennial flow. The mission was moved to a second site in present-day San Juan Capistrano, where it still stands. The Spanish referred to the Acjachemem as the Juañeno. The Spanish made the first recorded anthropogenic changes to hydrology in the San Juan watershed, which included excavating irrigation channels, diverting water from streams, and channelizing and changing course of streams. Grazing animals introduced by Europeans, mainly cattle (and later sheep, after a drought decimated the local cattle ranching industry), consumed native grasses and left hillsides exposed <b>and</b> <b>prone</b> to erosion.|$|E

40|$|CT colonography (CTC) is a {{minimally}} invasive screening technique for colorectal polyps and colon cancer. Most CTC protocols acquire both <b>prone</b> <b>and</b> supine images {{to improve the}} visualization of the lumen wall, reduce false positives, and improve sensitivity. Comparisons between the <b>prone</b> <b>and</b> supine images can be facilitated by computerized registration between the scans. In this paper, an algorithm for registering colons segmented from <b>prone</b> <b>and</b> supine images is presented. The algorithm uses feature matching of the colon centerline and {{a modified version of}} the demons deformable registration algorithm to define a deformation field between the <b>prone</b> <b>and</b> supine lumen surface. Experimental registration results, when used to determine polyp correspondence between <b>prone</b> <b>and</b> supine images, show an accuracy of 13. 77 ± 6. 20 mm over 21 datasets with an average Jaccard similarity coefficient of 0. 915 ± 0. 07.

5|$|Later in August, Alabama {{departed}} for the Pacific theater; {{the ship was}} assigned to the US Third Fleet during the amphibious operations in the Gilbert islands, particularly Kwajalein in early 1944. During the night of 21 February 1944, Alabamas 5-inch guns were firing upon Japanese aircraft in the area. The ship turned {{in the direction of the}} Japanese aircraft in order to better engage them, but the rearmost turret was masked behind the amidships mount. The gunner in the rearmost turret accidentally overrode the safety mechanism that prevented the gun from firing in that circumstance, and when the gun was fired, it hit the 5-inch turret in front of it. Five men were killed and 11 wounded in the incident; an investigation revealed that the override switch was faulty <b>and</b> <b>prone</b> to accidental operation.|$|E
5|$|Sibelius's {{national}} stature was recognised in 1897 when he {{was awarded}} a state pension to enable him {{to spend more time}} composing. In 1904 he and Aino settled in Ainola, a country residence he built on the shores of Lake Tuusula in Järvenpää, where they lived for the remainder of their lives. Although life at Ainola was not always calm and carefree—Sibelius was often in debt <b>and</b> <b>prone</b> to bouts of heavy drinking—he managed over the following 20 years to produce a large output of orchestral works, chamber music, piano pieces and songs, as well as lighter music. His popularity spread across Europe to the United States where, during a triumphant tour in 1914, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Yale University. At home his status was such that his 50th birthday celebrations in 1915 were a national event, the centrepiece of which was the Helsinki premiere of his Fifth Symphony.|$|E

Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece.
