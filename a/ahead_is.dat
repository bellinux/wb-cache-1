5|$|The street runs {{east from}} Temple Bar, the {{boundary}} between the Cities of London and Westminster, as a continuation of the Strand from Trafalgar Square. It crosses Chancery Lane and Fetter Lane to reach Ludgate Circus by the London Wall. The road <b>ahead</b> <b>is</b> Ludgate Hill. The street numbering runs consecutively from west to east south-side and then east to west north-side. It links the Roman and medieval boundaries of the City after the latter was extended. The section of Fleet Street between Temple Bar and Fetter Lane is part of the A4, a major road running west through London, although it once ran along the entire street and eastwards past St Paul's Churchyard towards Cannon Street.|$|E

This safety system featured an infrared steering wheel mounted camera which monitors driver attentiveness, sounding an alarm if danger <b>ahead</b> <b>is</b> detected and the driver is not paying attention.|$|E
25|$|Pytheas {{crossed the}} waters northward from Berrice, {{in the north}} of the British Isles, but whether to starboard, larboard, or {{straight}} <b>ahead</b> <b>is</b> not known. From the time of the Roman Empire all the possibilities were suggested repeatedly by each generation of writers: Iceland, Shetland, the Faroe Islands, Norway and later Greenland. A manuscript variant of a name in Pliny has abetted the Iceland theory: Nerigon instead of Berrice, which sounds like Norway. If one sails west from Norway one encounters Iceland. Burton himself espoused this theory.|$|E

25|$|The {{complex is}} entered from Grosvenor Road through the Propylaeum, a GradeI listed building. This {{consists}} of a massive entablature supported on widely spaced (areostyle) Doric columns, flanked by temple-like lodges. Directly <b>ahead</b> <b>is</b> the former Shire Hall (also listed GradeI) which now houses the Crown Courts. Its façade has 19bays, the central seven bays of which project forward and constitute a Doric portico. To the left is the former barracks block which is now {{the home of the}} Cheshire Military Museum. To the right is the block which was originally an armoury and later an officers' mess. Both blocks are in neoclassical style and are listed GradeI.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} {{is on the}} north side, adjacent to the north-east tower, and defended by a portcullis and two doors. A straight mural stair leads up to the right, while <b>ahead</b> <b>is</b> a barrel-vaulted basement with slit windows and a well. The hall is at first-floor level, and was also vaulted, rising to 8.3m high. A turnpike stair in the south-east corner gave access to another storey above the hall, as well as upper rooms in the eastern towers. The towers had one room on each floor. In {{the basement of the}} north-east tower is a prison only accessible from above, while at the top there is access to the four storeys of the tower, via modern iron ladders, opening onto an impressive view from the roof. The top of the north-east tower, including corbels, was also rebuilt in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|A {{stop sign}} is a traffic sign, usually erected at road {{junctions}} {{such as a}} four-way intersection, that instructs drivers to stop and then to proceed only if the way <b>ahead</b> <b>is</b> clear. The idea of placing stop signs at road junctions was first conceived in 1890 when William Phelps Eno of Saugatuck, Connecticut proposed and devised {{the first set of}} traffic laws in an article published in Rider and Driver. However, the first use of stop signs did not appear until 1915 when officials in Detroit, Michigan installed a stop sign with black letters on a white background. Throughout the years and with many alterations made to the stop sign, the current version with white block-lettering on a red background that is used in the United States as well as emulated in many other countries around the world today, did not come into use until the Joint Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices adopted the design in 1975.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a map and}} {{numbered}} {{trail from}} the entrance on Crescent Wood off Sydenham Hill and there is another entrance by the footbridge on Cox's Walk. By public transport the Crescent Wood entrance {{can be reached by}} bus 356 from Forest Hill station alighting at the 'Crescent Wood Road' stop. Buses on route 363 from Crystal Palace also pass near the entrance at an adjacent 'Crescent Wood Road' stop. The wood can also be reached from Sydenham Hill railway station. From the station through the white gate {{on the opposite side of}} the road into Low Cross Wood Lane and on the left just <b>ahead</b> <b>is</b> a gate to Dulwich Wood. In Dulwich Wood follow the path straight ahead until turning to the right just before the pond. This will bring you out close to Crescent Wood tunnel in Sydenham Hill Wood. If the gate into Dulwich Wood is locked follow the steeply upward sloping lane onto Crescent Wood Road, turning left at the top and following the road will bring you to the Crescent Wood Road entrance.|$|E
500|$|Beginning at Main Street, U.S.A. Station {{adjacent}} to Disneyland's entrance, where a pump-style handcar {{built by the}} Kalamazoo Manufacturing Company {{can be seen on}} a siding, the trains of the Disneyland Railroad travel along its single track in a clockwise direction on its circular route. The train will take around 18 minutes to complete a round trip on the main line when three trains are running, and 20 minutes when four trains are running; on any given day, between two and four trains run, with three trains running on average. An engineer accompanied by a fireman operates the locomotive, while conductors {{at each end of the}} train supervise the passengers. Prior to departing Main Street, U.S.A. Station, the engineer must confirm whether the signal light in the locomotive's cab is green, indicating that the track segment <b>ahead</b> <b>is</b> clear, or red, indicating that the track segment <b>ahead</b> <b>is</b> occupied by another train. The DRR's route is divided into eleven such segments, or blocks, and each locomotive has a block signal in its cab to communicate the status of each block. Prior to the installation of cab signalling in the locomotives around 2005, the status of each block along the railroad's [...] of main-line track was displayed by track-side block signals, of which only the ones at the four stations remain.|$|E
500|$|Many {{aspects of}} the battle {{have been the subject}} of both {{contemporary}} and historical debate, beginning right after the battle.

[...] Hood, in commentary written on the reverse of his copy, observed that this eliminated any possibility of engaging an enemy who was disordered, since it would require the British line to also be disordered. Instead, he maintained, [...] "the British fleet should be as compact as possible, in order to take the critical moment of an advantage opening ..." [...] Others criticise Hood because he [...] "did not wholeheartedly aid his chief", and that a lesser officer [...] "would have been court-martialled for not doing his utmost to engage the enemy." ...|$|E
