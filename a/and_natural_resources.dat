5|$|Mouflon (Ovis aries orientalis) was {{introduced}} from 1962â€“1964, {{and a plan}} to release axis deer (Axis axis) in 1964 was prevented only by protests from the ranching industry, who {{said that they would}} damage crops and spread disease. The hunting industry fought back, and the back-and-forth between the ranchers and hunters eventually gave way to a rise in public environmental concern. With the development of astronomical facilities on Mauna Kea commencing, conservationists demanded protection of Mauna Kea's ecosystem. A plan was proposed to fence 25% of the forests for protection, and manage the remaining 75% for game hunting. Despite opposition from conservationists the plan was put into action. While the land was partitioned no money was allocated for the building of the fence. In the midst of this wrangling the Endangered Species Act was passed; the National Audubon Society and Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against the Hawaii Department of Land <b>and</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Resources,</b> claiming that they were violating federal law, in the landmark case Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land <b>and</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Resources</b> (1978).|$|E
