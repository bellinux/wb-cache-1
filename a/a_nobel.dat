5|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, retroviruses and reverse {{transcriptase}} were discovered, showing {{for the first}} time that enzymes could copy RNA into DNA (the opposite of the usual route for transmission of genetic information). For this work, David Baltimore, Renato Dulbecco and Howard Temin were awarded <b>a</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Gerty Theresa Cori (née Radnitz; August 15, 1896 – October 26, 1957) was a Jewish Czech-American {{biochemist}} {{who became}} the third woman—and first American woman—to win <b>a</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize in science, and {{the first woman to}} be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.|$|E

5|$|Grameen Bank is {{the only}} {{business}} corporation to have won <b>a</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize. Professor Ole Danbolt Mjøs, Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, in his speech said that, by giving the prize to Grameen Bank and Muhammad Yunus, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wanted to encourage attention on achievements of the Muslim world, on the women's perspective, and on the fight against poverty.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the cost}} of schizophrenia—including direct costs (outpatient, inpatient, drugs, and {{long-term}} care) and non-health care costs (law enforcement, reduced workplace productivity, and unemployment)—was estimated to be $62.7 billion in 2002. The book and film A Beautiful Mind chronicles the life of John Forbes Nash, <b>a</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize–winning mathematician who was diagnosed with schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Maria Goeppert Mayer (June 28, 1906 – February 20, 1972) was a German-born American {{theoretical}} physicist, and Nobel laureate in Physics for proposing {{the nuclear}} shell {{model of the}} atomic nucleus.

5|$|Parathyroid hormone was {{isolated}} in 1923 by Adolph M. Hanson and 1925 by James B. Collip. Studies of parathyroid hormone levels by Roger Guillemin, Andrew Schally and Rosalyn Sussman Yalow {{led to the}} development of immunoassays capable of measuring body substances and <b>a</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Robert Koch, {{a pioneer}} in medical microbiology, worked on cholera, anthrax and tuberculosis. In his {{research}} into tuberculosis Koch finally proved the germ theory, for which he received <b>a</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize in 1905. In Koch's postulates, he set out criteria to test if an organism {{is the cause of}} a disease, and these postulates are still used today.|$|E
5|$|Studies on RNA {{interference}} gleaned <b>a</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize for Andrew Fire and Craig Mello in 2006, {{and another}} Nobel was awarded {{for studies on}} the transcription of RNA to Roger Kornberg in the same year. The discovery of gene regulatory RNAs has led to attempts to develop drugs made of RNA, such as siRNA, to silence genes.|$|E

5|$|The University of Bristol is {{associated}} with two Ig Nobel Prizes, an award for unusual or trivial achievements in scientific research. Sir Michael Berry shared the award (with Andre Geim, <b>a</b> <b>Nobel</b> Laureate) for using magnets to levitate a frog. Gareth Jones also shared an Ig Nobel prize for scientifically documenting fellatio in fruit bats.|$|E
5|$|Allegations of {{research}} misconduct or improprieties have received substantial press coverage. Professor David Baltimore, <b>a</b> <b>Nobel</b> Laureate, became {{embroiled in a}} misconduct investigation starting in 1986 that led to Congressional hearings in 1991. Professor Ted Postol has accused the MIT administration since 2000 of attempting to whitewash potential research misconduct at the Lincoln Lab facility involving a ballistic missile defense test, though a final investigation into the matter has not been completed. Associate Professor Luk Van Parijs was dismissed in 2005 following allegations of scientific misconduct and found guilty of the same by the United States Office of Research Integrity in 2009.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, Nobel Prizes {{have been}} awarded to 844 men, 48 women (Marie Curie won it twice), and 27 organizations. Sixteen women {{have won the}} Nobel Peace Prize, {{fourteen}} have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, twelve have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, four have won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, two have won the Nobel Prize in Physics and one, Elinor Ostrom, has won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The first woman to win <b>a</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize was Marie Curie, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 with her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel. Curie is also the only woman to have won multiple Nobel Prizes; in 1911, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Curie's daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935, making the two the only mother-daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes. The most Nobel Prizes awarded to women {{in a single year}} was in 2009, when five women became laureates. The most recent women to be awarded <b>a</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize were Tu Youyou and Svetlana Alexievich (2015).|$|E

5|$|Exocytosis in prokaryotes: Membrane {{vesicular}} exocytosis, {{popularly known}} as membrane vesicle trafficking, <b>a</b> <b>Nobel</b> prize-winning (year, 2013) process, is traditionally regarded as a prerogative of eukaryotic cells. This myth was however broken with the revelation that nanovesicles, {{popularly known as}} bacterial outer membrane vesicles, released by gram-negative microbes, translocate bacterial signal molecules to host or target cells to carry out multiple processes in favour of the secreting microbe e.g., in host cell invasion and microbe-environment interactions, in general.|$|E
5|$|Immunology {{made a great}} advance {{towards the}} end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of humoral {{immunity}} and cellular immunity. Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich, who proposed the side-chain theory to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction; his contributions to the understanding of humoral immunity were recognized by the award of <b>a</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize in 1908, which was jointly awarded to the founder of cellular immunology, Elie Metchnikoff.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson serendipitously {{discovered}} the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal {{in the microwave}} band. Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the big-bang predictions by Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950. Through the 1970s the radiation {{was found to be}} approximately consistent with a black body spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded <b>a</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize in 1978.|$|E
