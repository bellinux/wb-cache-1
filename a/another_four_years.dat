5|$|Although the Americans {{had taken}} the vessel, Sterett had no orders to take prizes and so was obliged to release her. Enterprise {{completed}} her journey to Malta, and received honor and praise from the squadron's Commodore on her return to the fleet. The success of the battle boosted morale in the United States, since it was that country's first victory {{in the war against}} the Tripolitans.

The city exterior is represented by Bristol, though Holby City is filmed at BBC Elstree Centre in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. The Casualty set in Bristol was not large enough to encompass the surgical ward and operating theatre required for Holby City, and as a result, some crossover scenes in the first episode had to be shot twice, first on the Casualty set and then again at Elstree, with cast members travelling between the two locations. In October 2007, BBC cutbacks led The Daily Telegraph to report that the Elstree site would be sold, and Holby City relocated to share a set with Casualty, possibly in Cardiff.

5|$|The mass {{scrapping}} of obsolete ships after World War I {{had caused}} {{a downturn in}} demand for scrap iron {{by the time the}} Navy decided to sell off Warrior on 2 April 1925. There was no commercial interest in scrapping the old ship, and she remained at Portsmouth for <b>another</b> <b>four</b> <b>years.</b> She was modified into a mooring jetty beginning on 22 October 1927. This entailed the removal of all of her equipment and masts other than her boilers and generators, and the installation of two diesel-driven emergency pumps. The space under the poop was converted into accommodation for a shipkeeper and his family. The hulk was towed to her new home, Pembroke Dock in Wales, on 13 March 1929 where she served as a floating oil jetty. For the next fifty years, the ship lay just offshore from an oil depot at Llanion Cove. The Navy covered the ship's upper deck with a thick layer of concrete during one of her maintenance dockings before World War II. In the war, she served as a base ship for coastal minesweepers and, on 27 August 1942, was renamed as Oil Fuel Hulk C77 to release her name for use by a light aircraft carrier, , then under construction. She refuelled 5,000 ships during her service at Llanion Cove.|$|E

Engineers Canada expects us to teach engineers the fundamentals of engineering, and the skills for them to independently acquire the knowledge required for professional practice.

Each of us has a different answer to these questions. This presentation will challenge you to think about what it means to be an engineer and how we convey our common principles to young engineers. ...|$|R
