I only want him to call me father temporarily so that I can faithfully transmit all the skills I have learned {{in my life to}} a single person. Later, when I die, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do is to bury my old bones in the earth and not allow them to be exposed, and that is all".|$|E
500|$|Talks {{about the}} 2014 NBA draft began awkwardly when Paul Stauskas told Sports Illustrated about his son, Nik: [...] "He knows <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> {{do is keep}} his nose to the {{grindstone}} for another couple of months, and there’s a really good possibility {{he might be able}} to go pro." [...] Several days later Stauskas tried to distance himself from his father's statement, apologizing to his fans. After the season Stauskas, Robinson and McGary said that they were considering entering the draft, but had not made a decision. Each submitted evaluation requests to the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee, which was required to respond by April 14 (giving the players until April 27 to declare their eligibility). On April 10 it was reported that Stauskas had decided to turn pro, but he denied he had made a decision. The reports were based on rumors that Stauskas had decided to hire Mark Bartelstein (father of former Michigan teammate Josh Bartelstein and agent for former teammate Tim Hardaway, Jr.) as his agent. In an April 15 joint press conference on the Big Ten Network, Robinson and Stauskas announced that they were declaring their eligibility for the NBA draft. When he learned that he had tested positive for marijuana after the Sweet Sixteen victory over Tennessee and was facing a one-year suspension, McGary also entered the draft.|$|E
500|$|Discussion {{about him}} {{entering}} the 2014 NBA draft {{began when he}} got hot in January 2014 and his father told Sports Illustrated, [...] "He knows <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do is keep his nose to the grindstone for another couple of months, and there’s a really good possibility {{he might be able}} to go Pro." [...] However, a few days later, Stauskas attempted to distance himself from his father's statements and apologized to his fans. Following the season, Stauskas, who was regarded as a likely late first round selection, said he would need some time to process his decision and that he would make his decision after talking to his coaches and family. On April 6, Stauskas said he would make his decision within the next week or so. On April 7, David Aldridge rated Stauskas as the number one potential draft entrant among shooting guards (ahead of Harris, James Young, and Andrew Harrison) and a late lottery selection. Others agree that Stauskas is a likely late lottery selection. Stauskas and teammates McGary and Robinson all submitted evaluation requests to the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee which must respond by April 14, giving the players until April 27 to make themselves eligible for the draft if they so choose. On April 10, reports emerged that Stauskas had decided to go pro, but he denied he had made a decision. The reports were based on rumors that Stauskas had decided to hire Mark Bartelstein as his agent. Bartelstein is the father of former Michigan teammate Josh Bartelstein, and agent for former teammate Tim Hardaway, Jr. On April 15, in a joint press conference with Robinson on the Big Ten Network, Stauskas declared for the 2014 NBA draft. During his two years with Michigan, the school enjoyed its winningest two-year stretch in school history marked by a total of 59 wins. Of Michigan's prior 14 early NBA draft entrants, 10 were selected in the first round and 3 in the second. Stauskas did sign with Bartelstein (along with teammate McGary). On May 5, Stauskas threw out the ceremonial first pitch for the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park.|$|E

500|$|Homer {{attempts}} to appease Grimes by inviting {{him to his}} home for a lobster dinner {{in order to make}} him and his enemy co-worker friends. Grimes' visit to the Simpson house only fuels his resentment; he is incensed by Homer's ability to live such a comfortable life and earn so many accomplishments (such as being friends with former president Gerald Ford, going on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins, going into space, and winning a Grammy) despite his slothful and ignorant ways, while Grimes has to live a life of hard work and <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> show for it is a battered briefcase, a bad haircut, and a single room apartment between two bowling alleys. Declaring Homer a [...] "fraud", a bitter Grimes storms away in anger. The following day, Homer, after getting advice from Marge, makes further {{attempts to}} earn Grimes' respect by acting as a model employee, but his efforts fail. Grimes rants about Homer to Lenny and Carl, both of whom insist that despite his faults, Homer is essentially a decent person. To prove Homer's lack of intelligence, he tricks Homer into entering a nuclear power plant design contest intended for children, by carefully cutting away all references to them in a promotional poster which he leaves at Homer's control panel. Homer, unaware that the contest is only open to kids, eagerly takes on the challenge to prove his professionalism. At the contest, Grimes is horrified when Homer's model, which is almost exactly the same as the current power plant with only a few modifications, easily wins against Ralph Wiggum's Malibu Stacy dream house, and Martin Prince's futuristic model that supplies power to the room. The audience's applause and cheers for Homer cause Grimes to finally snap and he runs amok through the plant, mimicking and mocking Homer's habits. Entering Homer's office, Grimes sees a machine labeled [...] "Extremely High Voltage", sarcastically declares that he does not need safety gloves because he's Homer Simpson, grabs the high voltage wires and is fatally electrocuted. At Grimes' funeral (with a headstone that simply reads [...] "Grimes"), Homer unintentionally and unknowingly gets the last laugh as he falls asleep and in a drowsy state tells Marge to change the TV channel, causing all the attendees to burst into laughter and completely ignore Grimes' coffin as it's lowered into the earth.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} [...] "having the same number" [...] or [...] "having the same cardinality" [...] can be {{captured}} {{by the idea of}} one-to-one correspondence. [...] This (purely definitional) assumption is sometimes known as Hume's principle. [...] As Frege said, [...] "If a waiter wishes to be certain of laying exactly as many knives on a table as plates, he has no need to count either of them; <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do is to lay immediately to the right of every plate a knife, taking care that every knife on the table lies immediately to the right of a plate. [...] Plates and knives are thus correlated one to one." [...] Sets in such a correlation are called equinumerous, and the correlation is called a one-to-one correspondence.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, why wasn't {{that the}} happy ending? <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was go in, collect cash and ticket, and there <b>he</b> would <b>have</b> been, on velvet." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Is that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say?" [...] she asked. [...] "You told me {{he could}} help us. You led me to suppose he could find the guilty person." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Boys," [...] he said, [...] "you {{have got}} to be reasonable. I bought that horse. If the deadbeat who made the deal with me wants it back, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do is to produce the money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can promise}} you that," [...] he told her. [...] "This isn't David's job at <b>all.</b> <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> stick to his post and help out the bluff as a press correspondent. Don't be afraid, Felicia. You shall have your David." ...|$|E
60|$|It was <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{offer her}} except the {{medicine}} which, by the doctor's instructions, he took {{three times a}} day in a quarter of a glass of water.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't call it {{anything}} {{to any one}} but you. I'm not 'against' them!" [...] Kate added as with just a fresh breath of impatience for <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be taught.|$|R
60|$|He seemed {{unable to}} go on, and yet {{both knew that}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{something}} important <b>to</b> tell them. He looked at them vacantly, as though <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say was suddenly gone out of his mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{he gives}} me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an' his club this week! But I know him. He thinks because YOU'RE earning he needn't keep the house any longer. No, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "not at all. A {{person can}} walk about a great way, sometimes, {{in a strange}} city, without getting lost. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do is to take care, at first, to go only in such {{directions}} as that he can keep the way home in his mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|He assented instantly. [...] "Quite right. Give me a crack on the ear {{every time}} I break out. I wish I were a robin. See that chap on the lawn! His clothes grow of themselves, {{and as for}} food, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do is to tap on the ground, and out pops a worm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't understand. We're {{specialists and}} {{get what we}} ask for. Sent the boss word we wanted an assistant, and, as we'd picked one up, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was {{to put him on}} the pay-roll." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{there was}} much to see to that afternoon. First of <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{discover}} the district superintendent registrar, and then to find a lodging whither he should take Ethel--their lodging, where they were to live together.|$|R
6000|$|But <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{very little}} time to ponder, and he never did make up his mind; {{for a few months}} after Christie's long visit ended, Uncle Enos [...] "was took suddin'," [...] and left <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Christ {{told the}} rich {{young man to}} sell all he had," [...] Ernest said bitterly. [...] "The Bishop obeyed Christ's {{injunction}} and got {{locked up in a}} madhouse.

6000|$|... "You'll {{know more}} about men when you're as old as I am," [...] said Mary patronizingly. [...] "Mind you, it doesn't do to believe all they tell you. Don't let Ken Ford think that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do to get you on a string is to drop his handkerchief. Have more spirit than that, child." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's jest it! That's jest what a feller {{wants to}} do! He ought ter {{make up his}} mind he's goin' to have a place, an' buy it. After that he can 'low to have a store, an' get one, too. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do is to work hard, an' save his money for a while." ...|$|E
60|$|Yet {{now this}} chance was {{presenting}} itself {{in all its}} simplicity, and <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was to grasp it. The door of the museum was not even closed. He could see from where he stood that it was ajar.|$|R
6000|$|... "A cry of exultation escaped {{him after}} the shot. The trumpeter raised his trumpet nearly {{to his lips and}} waited. But no word came from the {{prostrate}} man. I fell on one knee, and heard <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say then.|$|R
6000|$|Even {{though she}} cost him <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> lose, [...] Even though {{she made him}} sick to hear or see, [...] Still, what she left of him will mostly choose [...] Her skirts to sit by. How comes such to be? ...|$|R
60|$|DOYLE. No: he's {{too lazy}} to take the trouble. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do is {{to sit there and}} drink your whisky while you humbug yourself. However, we needn't argue about Haffigan, for two reasons. First, with your money in his pocket he will never reach Paddington: there are too many public houses on the way. Second, he's not an Irishman at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, there's {{no denying}} he's got a taking way with women. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> {{do is to}} whistle 'em up like dogs. Most {{remarkable}} faculty, that.

50|$|After three {{location}}s, Mark {{was first}} place {{by a wide}} margin and <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do for the last location was to get it within 14 feet. But he chunked the bunker shot and it barely got out, so Andy won the contest.|$|R
60|$|Martin {{looking at}} her averted face, knowing that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was to reach {{out his hand and}} pluck her, fell to pondering whether, after all, there was any real worth in refined, {{grammatical}} English, and, so, forgot to reply to her.|$|R
