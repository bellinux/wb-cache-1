5|$|Although {{the senate}} could do little short of {{assassination}} and open rebellion to contravene {{the will of}} the emperor, it survived the Augustan restoration and the turbulent Year of Four Emperors to retain its symbolic political centrality during the Principate. The senate legitimated the emperor's rule, and the emperor needed the experience of senators as legates (legati) to serve as generals, diplomats, <b>and</b> <b>administrators.</b> A successful career required competence as an administrator and remaining in favour with the emperor, or over time perhaps multiple emperors.|$|E

Although from an unremarkable background, Atangana's loyalty and friendship with colonial priests <b>and</b> <b>administrators</b> secured him successively more prominent posts in the colonial government. He proved himself an intelligent and diplomatic administrator and an eager collaborator, and he was eventually named paramount chief of two Beti-Pahuin subgroups, the Ewondo and Bane peoples. His loyalty and acquiescence to the German Empire was unquestioning, and he even accompanied the Germans on their escape from Africa in World War I.|$|E
5|$|Criticism often arises after single acts of {{violence}} committed during fights.

Some players acknowledge that there is no harm in discussing the issue; however, most players <b>and</b> <b>administrators</b> continue to insist that fighting stay as a permanent element of organized ice hockey. Some league administrators, such as former NHL senior vice-president and director of hockey operations Colin Campbell, have been circulating the idea of banning fighting in response to incidents such as the Fedoruk–Orr fight.|$|E

5|$|During {{its early}} years, Georgetown College {{suffered}} from considerable financial strain.

The school relied on private sources of funding and the limited profits from local lands which had been donated to the Jesuits. To raise money for Georgetown and other schools in 1838, Maryland Jesuits conducted a mass sale of some 272 slaves to two Deep South plantations in Maringouin, Louisiana from their six in Maryland, ending their slaveholding.|$|E
5|$|Enrollment levels {{held steady}} into the Great Depression; but in 1933, the Ohio State Senate Welfare Commission {{proposed}} {{a plan to}} convert the school into a mental health institution.

The Student Protest Committee coordinated with the faculty and administration to organize a campus rally and march through the downtown Bowling Green. Members of the Protest Committee then launched a letter-writing campaign to community leaders throughout northwest Ohio, which helped convince the state legislature that closing the school would be counterproductive. The measure was defeated by a 14–5 vote. A few years later, in May 1935, the college was granted university status and {{changed its name to}} Bowling Green State University.|$|E
5|$|From about 1498, {{power in}} Moldavia quietly shifted toward {{a group of}} boyars <b>and</b> <b>administrators,</b> comprising, among others, Luca Arbore and Ioan Tăutu.

The treaty, which Stephen ratified at Hârlău in 1499, {{put an end to}} Polish suzerainty over Moldavia. Stephen again stopped paying tribute to the Ottomans in 1500, although by then his health had declined. In February 1501, his delegation arrived in Venice, asking for a specialist doctor.
