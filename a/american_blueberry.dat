5000|$|Since {{many people}} refer to [...] "blueberries", {{no matter if}} they mean the {{bilberry}} (European blueberry) Vaccinium myrtillus or the <b>American</b> <b>blueberries,</b> {{there is a lot}} of confusion about the two closely similar fruits. One can distinguish bilberries from their American counterpart by the following differences: ...|$|R
50|$|Adding to the {{confusion}} is the fact there are also wild <b>American</b> <b>blueberry</b> varieties, sold in stores mainly in the USA and Canada. These are uncommon outside of Northern America. Even more confusion {{is due to the}} huckleberry name, which originates from English dialectal names 'hurtleberry' and 'whortleberry' for the bilberry.|$|E
5000|$|Vaccinium myrtillus is {{a species}} of shrub with edible fruit of blue color, {{commonly}} called [...] "bilberry", [...] "wimberry", [...] "whortleberry", or European blueberry. It has {{much in common with}} the <b>American</b> <b>blueberry</b> (Vaccinium cyanococcus). It is more precisely called common bilberry or blue whortleberry, to distinguish it from other Vaccinium relatives. Regional names include blaeberry, hurtleberry, huckleberry, wimberry, whinberry, winberry , and fraughan.|$|E
5000|$|The {{names of}} {{blueberries}} in languages other than English often translate as [...] "blueberry", e.g., Scots blaeberry and Norwegian blåbær. Blaeberry, blåbær and French myrtilles usually {{refer to the}} European native bilberry (V. myrtillus), while bleuets refers to the North <b>American</b> <b>blueberry.</b> Russian голубика ("blue berry") does not refer to blueberries, which are non-native and nearly unknown in Russia, but rather to their close relatives, bog bilberries (V. uliginosum).|$|E
50|$|Vaccinium crassifolium is {{the only}} species in Vaccinium sect. Herpothamnus. Some sources have {{recognized}} a second species, V. sempervirens, but recent authors combine the two into a single species. Creeping blueberries, although they are native to North America, {{do not seem to}} be most closely related to North <b>American</b> <b>blueberries,</b> but instead to South American Vaccinium species.|$|R
5000|$|Bilberries - {{which are}} native to Europe and the British Isles - {{are to be}} {{distinguished}} from North <b>American</b> <b>blueberries,</b> although the species are closely related, being of the same genus, Vaccinium. Bilberry fruits have a smooth, circular outline at the end opposite their point of attachment, whereas blueberries retain persistent sepals there, leaving a rough, star-shaped pattern of five flaps. Bilberries are dark in color, and usually appear near black with a slight shade of purple.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the quality {{characteristics of the}} Korean and <b>American</b> <b>blueberry.</b> There was a similarity between the general composition and sugar content of the Korean and American values. The pH values showed a low of 3. 46 in American blueberries {{to a high of}} 4. 49 in Korean blueberries. The L (lightness), a (redness), and b (yellowness) value scores of the <b>American</b> <b>blueberry</b> were higher than the Korean blueberry. The levels of total phenol content and DPPH radical scavenging abilities were 205 mg%, 93. 48 % in the Korean blueberry and 182 mg%, 84. 32 % in the <b>American</b> <b>blueberry,</b> respectively. The free sugar levels showed fructose 2, 514 mg%, glucose 2, 315 mg%, and sucrose 69 mg % in the Korean blueberry, while the free sugar levels of the <b>American</b> <b>blueberry</b> showed fructose 2, 106 mg%, glucose 1, 825 mg%. The contents of organic acid were lactic acid and tartaric acid in the Korean blueberry, while the organic acid in the <b>American</b> <b>blueberry</b> contained tartaric acid, succinic acid, oxalic acid, and lactic acid. The Korean blueberry has 12 kinds of free amino acids, while the <b>American</b> <b>blueberry</b> has 9 kinds of free amino acids. Furthermore, the Korean blueberry contains 390 mg % of total amino acids, which was higher than 32 % in the <b>American</b> <b>blueberry</b> with 295 mg % of total amino acids.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study has been to {{determine}} the stability, microbiological quality, and antioxidant properties of extracts from the berry fruits of black chokeberry, <b>American</b> <b>blueberry,</b> and bilberry. In addition, the content of polyphenolic compounds in the extracts was analysed and the ratio of the content of anthocyanins to total phenols (the ACY/TP ratio) was determined. Extracts from the fruits of black chokeberry, <b>American</b> <b>blueberry,</b> and bilberry had different stability, microbiological quality, content of polyphenols, and ACY/TP ratio. The highest stability of anthocyanins and the highest ACY/TP ratio were determined in the extracts from bilberry, and the lowest ones appeared in the extracts from <b>American</b> <b>blueberry.</b> The stability of anthocyanins tended to decline during storage, either cooled or frozen. No bacteria were found in the berry fruit extracts although small contamination with microorganisms (yeast, mould) was detected. The highest content of polyphenolic compounds was determined in the extracts from black chokeberry and the lowest one in the extracts from <b>American</b> <b>blueberry.</b> The antioxidant activity of the extracts ranged from 1. 99 to 2. 41 TEAC mmol TR/ 100 g, and the antiradical activity varied from 84. 91 % to 86. 30 %. The applied extraction method with citric acid had a positive influence on the stability, microbiological quality, and antioxidant properties of the fruit extracts...|$|E
50|$|The typical {{vegetation}} in the Southeast is forests, {{with much}} of the sandy coastal regions dominated by old growth forests of loblolly pine, longleaf pine, shortleaf pine and slash pine, and inland areas have deciduous forests usually consisting of various pine species along with oak, hickory, sweetgum, blackgum, red maple and winged elm.

40|$|In {{the article}} the authors {{present the results}} of the study {{biometric}} and qualitative characteristics of berries highbush blueberry varieties (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) in a specific soil and climatic conditions Forest-steppe of Ukraine (Kiev). Investigations were carried out on 11 varieties of <b>American</b> highbush <b>blueberry.</b> Phenological observations, biometric surveys, tasting score and biochemical analysis of the berries have been conducted during the growing season. By results of researches the group of early-ripening varieties includes Bluestar, Earliblue, Patriot, the middle-ripening – Jonne, Atlantis, Bluegold, Bluecrop, Chyk and late-ripening varieties – Amanda, Darrow, Toro. Duration of collecting period of ripe berries was lower (16 days) in varieties Bluestar, Earliblue, Jonne and Darrow. Berries were large sizes in the varieties of Darrow, Amanda, Jonne, in other varieties berries were medium size. By tasting score the berry of varieties Toro, Earliblue, Jonne and Darrow were the best. For biochemical parameters the better varieties were Amanda, Jonne and Earliblue...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the plant}} {{features}} of this bog are the carnivorous plants.

40|$|Abstract: The high bush {{blueberry}} breeding {{program at}} RIFG Pitesti {{has been conducted}} since 1982, having the aim the obtaining new cultivars well adapted to the Romanian ecological conditions. The main objectives of this program were high yield and quality, extending the ripening season, good plant habit and evenness in ripening for the easy of picking. For inducing the variability, different genetic resources, mainly <b>American</b> high bush <b>blueberry</b> cultivars {{were involved in a}} high number of controlled crosses and open hybridizations. Consequently, more than 20. 000 off springs in the hybrid selection field and 540 selections in micro trials were evaluated. In 1998 the first new cultivars were released: Azur and Safir, followed by Angusta cv. (in 1999) and other 4 new cvs. : Delicia, Simultan (in 2001), Lax and Compact (in 2002). Also, other promising selections have been now under evaluation in the field trial. Of these, E 4 / 45 and E 3 / 85 advanced selections are ready to be named. These are high yielding in the first fruiting years (2. 15 kg/bush and, 2. 31 kg per bush respectively, versus 1. 40 kg/bush of the control cv., Bluecrop). The paper deals with the highlighting of some results obtained along the breeding program regarding the crossability of different genitors in simple and reciprocal crosses, the heritability of the main quantitative characters: bush vigour, productivity, berry size and colour within some hybrids families and the new cultivars and advanced selection...|$|R
5000|$|In his youth, Giraud {{had been}} a passionate fan of <b>American</b> Westerns and <b>Blueberry</b> {{has its roots in}} his earlier Western-themed works such as the Frank et Jeremie shorts, which were drawn for Far West {{magazine}} when he was only 18 [...] - [...] also having been his first sales as free-lancer [...] - [...] , the Western short stories he created for the magazines from French publisher Fleurus (his first professional tenured employment as comic artist in the period 1956-1958), and his collaboration with Joseph [...] "Jijé" [...] Gillain on an episode of the latter's Jerry Spring series in 1960, which appeared in the Belgian comics magazine Spirou (":fr:La Route de Coronado", issues 1192 - 1213, 1961), aside from his subsequent Western contributions to Benoit Gillian's (son of Jijé) short-lived comic magazine Bonux-Boy (1960/61). Directly before he started his apprenticeship at Jijé, Jean Giraud had already approached Jean-Michel Charlier on his own accord, asking him if he was interested in writing scripts for a new western series for publication in Pilote, the just by Charlier co-launched legendary French comic magazine. Charlier refused on that occasion, claiming he never felt much empathy for the genre. Biographer :fr:Gilles Ratier though, has noted that Charlier, when he felt he was preaching to the choir, had the tendency to [...] "take liberties" [...] with actual events for dramatic effect. Charlier had in effect already written several Westerns, both comics and illustrated short prose stories, in the period 1949-1959 for various previous magazines. One such short entailed the text comic [...] "Cochise" [...] in Jeannot magazine, July 1957, dealing with the historical [...] "Bascom Affair", which six years later would become the apotheosis of the first Blueberry story, [...] "Fort Navajo". Furthermore, Charlier had already visited the South-West of the United States in 1960, resulting in several Native-American themed educational Pilote editorials.|$|R
