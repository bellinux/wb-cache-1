5|$|Following {{months of}} Euromaidan street protests that began {{because of his}} refusal to sign an <b>Association</b> <b>Agreement</b> with the European Union in favor of deals from Russia, President Yanukovych fled Kiev in February 2014, {{ultimately}} to Russia, and parliament voted to remove him from his post. This brought another change in direction of Ukraine's association with Europe and by extension NATO. In 2014, pro-Russian unrest occurred in eastern Ukraine and Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation in March. As {{part of an effort}} to assuage concerned groups, newly installed Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk addressed the topic in a Russian language speech on 18 March 2014, emphasizing that Ukraine was not seeking NATO membership. US President Barack Obama echoed this position the following week, while calling for greater NATO presence in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|On 15 January 1992, Croatia gained {{diplomatic}} recognition by the European Economic Community members, and subsequently the United Nations. The war effectively ended in August 1995 with a decisive victory by Croatia. This {{was accompanied by}} the exodus of about 200,000 Serbs from the rebel territories, whose lands were subsequently settled by Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The remaining occupied areas were restored to Croatia pursuant to the Erdut Agreement of November 1995, with the process concluded in January 1998. Croatia became a World Trade Organization (WTO) member on 30 November 2000. The country signed a Stabilization and <b>Association</b> <b>Agreement</b> (SAA) with the European Union in October 2001. Croatia {{became a member of}} NATO on 1 April 2009, and joined the European Union on 1 July 2013.|$|E
5|$|Since 2003, Croatian {{foreign policy}} has focused on {{achieving}} the strategic goal of becoming a member state of the European Union (EU). In December 2011, Croatia completed the EU accession negotiations and signed an EU accession treaty on 9 December 2011. Croatia joined the European Union on 1 July 2013 marking {{the end of a}} process started in 2001 by signing of the Stabilisation and <b>Association</b> <b>Agreement</b> and Croatian application for the EU membership in 2003. A recurring obstacle to the negotiations was Croatia's ICTY co-operation record and Slovenian blocking of the negotiations because of Croatia–Slovenia border disputes. The latter was resolved through an Arbitration Agreement of 4 November 2009, approved by national parliaments and a referendum in Slovenia.|$|E

5|$|The {{tensions}} {{between these two}} competing historical and cultural traditions erupted into political and social conflict during the Ukrainian crisis, which began when then Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign an <b>association</b> <b>agreement</b> with the European Union on 21 November 2013. Support for closer ties with Europe was strong in western and central Ukraine, whilst many in eastern and southern Ukraine traditionally favoured stronger relations with Russia. President Yanukovych, who drew most of his support from eastern regions, was forced out of office in February 2014. His ouster was followed by protests in eastern and southern Ukraine that placed {{a strong emphasis on}} the importance of historical ties to Russia, the Russian language, and antipathy towards the Euromaidan movement.|$|E
5|$|Ukraine {{submitted}} {{an application}} {{to participate in}} the Eurasian Economic Union as an observer in August 2013. Viktor Yanukovych's decision to abandon an <b>association</b> <b>agreement</b> with the European Union and exclusively pursue integration with the EEU was a key factor in the Euromaidan protests that ended his term as president of Ukraine and led to the Crimean Crisis. The country's membership in the EEU was seen by some analysts as the key {{to the success of the}} union as Ukraine has the second largest economy of any of the 15 former republics of the Soviet Union. With high tensions between Russia and Ukraine in the wake of the crisis, Ukraine decided to pursue integration with the EU.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{signature}} of its Stabilisation and <b>Association</b> <b>Agreement</b> in 2001, Croatia applied for European Union (EU) membership in 2003, the European Commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004, and the European Council granted candidate country status to Croatia in mid-2004. Accession negotiations, while originally set for March 2005, began in October of that year. Croatia completed the accession negotiations on 30 June 2011; on 9 December 2011 it signed the Treaty of Accession, changing its status from a candidate to an acceding country as it prepared to become the 28th EU member state. The ratification process by the Parliaments of all 27 current EU member states {{was expected to be}} concluded by the end of June 2013, and Croatia's accession to the EU was expected to take place on 1 July 2013. In addition to ratification by the current EU member states, Article 142 of the Constitution of Croatia requires that a binding referendum be held on sovereignty issues such as Croatian EU membership.|$|E

5|$|From 1993 to 2001, Orban {{served as}} a Parliamentary Counsellor on European and International Affairs within the Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian Parliament, where he was {{responsible}} for the European Integration Committee, as well as relations with the European Parliament. In 1995, the <b>Association</b> <b>Agreement</b> between the EU and Romania came into force and Orban also dealt with the Secretariat of the Joint Parliamentary Committee EU-Romania. Between May 2001 and December 2004, he served as Deputy Chief Negotiator and from December 2004 to December 2006, as Chief Negotiator with the EU and as Secretary of State of the Ministry of European Integration of Romania, directly responsible for coordinating Romania's preparation for accession to the EU, as well as drafting the Treaty of Accession. On 25 April 2005, together with the Romanian president Traian Băsescu, the Romanian prime minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu and the Romanian foreign minister Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu, Orban was one of the signatories for Romania on the country's Treaty of Accession in Luxembourg. After the signing of the Treaty, when Romania received the status of the observer in the Council of the European Union and in the Commission's committees, Orban was responsible for coordinating Romania's policies and positions in EU affairs. On 30 October 2006, Orban was nominated as Romania's candidate for the European Commission. From 1 January 2007, Orban became European Commissioner for Multilingualism for Romania in the Barroso commission.

It is argued that art. 8 TEU codifies the conditionality approach of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and introduces a differentiation with traditional <b>association</b> <b>agreements</b> for political reasons. The launch of the Eastern Partnership in May 2009, including the offer of concluding <b>association</b> <b>agreements</b> with the European Union's eastern partners, largely undermines {{the significance of this}} distinction.

Thus, we obtain new evidence about {{the determinants of}} the trade shares of the countries analysed. In addition, by using the corresponding dummies, we confirm that the <b>Association</b> <b>Agreements</b> have led to a preferential expansion of the exchanges between the EU and CEECs. ...|$|R
