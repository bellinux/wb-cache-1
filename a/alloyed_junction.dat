25|$|CADET used 324 {{point-contact}} transistors {{provided by}} the UK company Standard Telephones and Cables; 76 junction transistors {{were used for the}} first stage amplifiers for data read from the drum, since point-contact transistors were too noisy. From August 1956 CADET was offering a regular computing service, during which it often executed continuous computing runs of 80 hours or more. Problems with the reliability of early batches of point contact and <b>alloyed</b> <b>junction</b> transistors meant that the machine's mean time between failures was about 90minutes, but this improved once the more reliable bipolar junction transistors became available.|$|E

The theoretical basis of percussive welding, design considerations of the apparatus used, and the electrical characteristics of the junctions were the main objectives of this investigation. P-type silicon wafers and gold wire doped with arsenic as a N-type impurity source were the materials studied. It was found that percussive welding alone gave ohmic contacts. An alloying treatment changed the junctions to rectifying type. The junction capacitance versus reverse bias voltage relations were studied. From these relations, impurity profiles of a simple <b>alloyed</b> <b>junction</b> and an alloyed percussive-welded junction were obtained. A comparison between the two impurity profiles was given...|$|E
40|$|Bilayer thick {{films of}} {{sacrificial}} titanium dioxide and Nb-doped {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PZTN) have been deposited on bare silicon wafers using electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique. Deposition of such ceramic particles, dispersed ethanol-based suspensions, on semiconductor substrate has been made possible after preparation of <b>alloyed</b> <b>junctions</b> Al/Si characterized by ohmic behaviour. Sintering of green TiO 2 /PZTN films was performed at 900 â—¦C for 1 h. The composition of the films, the thickness and relative density of the deposited materials have been analysed by EDS-SEM analysis. The lead diffusion through the silicon wafer has been reduce...|$|R
