40|$|Web Service is the fitted {{technical}} solution which provides the required loose coupling to achieve Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). In previous works, we proposed an approach, using the Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) paradigm, {{to increase the}} adaptability of Web Services. This approach suffers from some deficiencies as dependency for both the programming language (Java) and the SOAP engine (AXIS). In this paper, we propose to increase the adaptability of Web Services by using the main AOP agreed semantics- <b>Advices,</b> Pointcuts and Joinpoints- to change original Web Service behavior. In the new approach, we consider that <b>advices</b> are themselves Web Services. Moreover, we propose to use an XML Language to describe Pointcuts, Joinpoints and for referencing <b>advices.</b> The invocation of <b>advices</b> (Web Services) is accomplished by an XQuery engine to ensure SOAP Engine independency and <b>advices</b> are implemented as Web Services to promote programming language independency. 1...|$|R
