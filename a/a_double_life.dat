5|$|On {{the other}} side, {{there were still}} huge numbers of Roman Catholics. Some conformed, bending with the times, hoping {{that there would be}} a fresh reverse.

Both Roman Catholic priests and laity lived <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>life,</b> apparently conforming, but avoiding taking the oath of conformity. Only as time passed did recusancy—refusal to attend Protestant services—became more common. Jesuits and seminary priests, trained in Douai and Rome to make good the losses of English priests, encouraged this.|$|E

25|$|The {{genesis of}} Zack and Miri {{has been in}} Kevin Smith's mind since the '90s. Two porn {{centered}} projects were in development. One was a film called Name.

But the project wasn't made, and was replaced with Dogma. The second attempt was in 1997 as a failed 22 episode series titled Hiatus. The series would've starred Lee again, and was about a man returning home after being away in California and leading <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>life</b> as a porn star. When he pitched the series to tv networks, they all rejected the idea believing that the kind of material handed to them can never happen on television.
