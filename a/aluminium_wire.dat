25|$|Copper {{building}} wire {{is compatible}} with brass and quality plated screws. The wire provides connections that will not corrode or creep. It is not, however, compatible with <b>aluminium</b> <b>wire</b> or connectors. If the two metals are joined, a galvanic reaction can occur. Anodic corrosion during the reaction can disintegrate the aluminium. This is why most appliance and electrical equipment manufacturers use copper lead wires for connections to building wiring systems.|$|E
25|$|Wrapping copper or <b>aluminium</b> <b>wire</b> around {{branches}} and trunks allows the bonsai designer {{to create the}} desired general form and make detailed branch and leaf placements. When wire is used on new branches or shoots, it holds the branches in place until they lignify (convert into wood). The time required is usually 69 months or one growing season for deciduous trees, but can be several years for conifers like pines and spruce, which maintain their branch flexibility through multiple growing seasons. Wires are also used to connect a branch to another object (e.g., another branch, the pot itself) so that tightening the wire applies force to the branch. Some species do not lignify strongly, and some specimens' branches are too stiff or brittle to be bent easily. These cases are not conducive to wiring, and shaping them is accomplished primarily through pruning.|$|E
25|$|BMW {{said the}} flexible, {{stretchable}} water resistant translucent man-made fabric skin– polyurethane-coated Spandex, is resilient and durable. It resists {{high or low}} temperatures, does not swell or shrink and the movement does not slacken or damage the fabric. The body changes its shape according to exterior conditions and speeds, and it also allows the driver to change its shape at will. The fabric is stretched over a moveable frame; essential shapes are formed beneath the skin by an <b>aluminium</b> <b>wire</b> structure, though at points where movement is needed (ducts, door openings, spoiler) flexible carbon struts are used. The shape of the frame is controlled by many electric and hydraulic actuators; for example, the headlights are revealed when small motors pull the fabric back in an eyelid like fashion. As the fabric is translucent the taillights shine through it.|$|E

500|$|... 20th and 21st century {{designers}} have sometimes offered metal corsets and bodices {{as part of}} their presentations, including Alexander McQueen, Issey Miyake, and Thierry Mugler. One of McQueen's most famous pieces was a 1999 aluminium corset, called the Coiled Corset, created in collaboration with the jeweller Shaun Leane and the artist Kees van der Graaf. Built around a cast of the model Laura Morgan's torso, the garment had a 15-inch waist and was composed of 97 stacked coils, which had to be screwed together onto Morgan's body. The Coiled Corset was inspired by the neck rings worn by Ndebele women, extended to encase the wearer's torso. In 2001, the corset formed part of a live presentation at the Victoria and Albert Museum showcasing McQueen and Leane's collaborations. Corsets and bustiers can also be made using wire, such as a 1983 <b>aluminium</b> <b>wire</b> bustier by Miyake which was cuffed around the torso over a feathered garment, offering a pun on the theme of birdcages.|$|E

40|$|In the {{original}} target {{design of the}} hydrogen-deuteride (HD) polarized target project [1], about 20 % by weight <b>aluminium</b> thin <b>wires</b> must be contained in the target solid HD in order to cool down the HD to the mK-range with a sufficiently high thermal conductivity for overcoming the conversion heat in the target. However, these <b>aluminium</b> <b>wires</b> bring undesirable background contributions in photoproduction measurement. A better option to employ single crystal HD was proposed [2] to remove the <b>aluminium</b> <b>wires</b> by utilizing the high and drastically anisotropic thermal conductivity observed in hexagonal parahydrogen crystal [3]. The ther-mal conductivity of 99. 999 % purity <b>aluminium</b> <b>wires</b> in {{the original}} target [4] is estimated as about 103 W/Km at 4 K and decreases with the temperature, steeply below about 0. 5 K [5]. The thermal conductivity measured on polycrystalline HD [6] becomes the maximum of about 10 W/Km at 4 K, also with the decrease below about 0. 5 K, and well explained by the phonon scattering theory on rotational impurities and boundaries [6]. Therefore, {{as the first step}} of the present development, a conductivity measurement on single crystal HD in the temperature region around the maximum was undertaken with a liquid helium cryostat at the laboratory of the University of Toyama. The sample assembly shown in Fig. 1 (a) was immersed in liquid helium bath of the cryostat and the cell temperature was precisely controlled during the direct crystallization process of HD gas in the cell. After crystallization, the conductivity measurement was carried out, the result of which is given i...|$|R
