Moreover, <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> more straitlaced and they have closer links with tradition. The most important thing in life for those living in the 'New World' is, ironically, respecting old traditions and accepting the rules of a good morality.

25|$|It {{is an old}} {{trick of}} the Indian Office to blacken the {{character}} of any Indian that happens, notwithstanding the retardation caused by the Indian Bureau, to rise a little above the ranks. So as soon as an educated Indian begins to deplore the conditions of his brother Indians, the Indian Office dubs such a one a disturber, an agitator, and lately he {{is placed in the}} Bolshevik class. The whole Indian Bureau system of managing Indian business {{to the detriment of the}} Indian but for the benefit of a few greedy and voracious whites, is the most dramatic autocracy in existence the world over. Gradually through assistance of the American press, the generous hearted and justice loving <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> learning something of this present day Indian government humbuggery and deceit practiced by the Indian Office forces.|$|E

500|$|McCain was a {{supporter}} of the Euromaidan protests against the elected Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his government, and appeared in Independence Square in Kiev in December 2013. Following the overthrow of Yanukovych and subsequent 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, McCain became a vocal supporter of providing arms to Ukrainian military forces, saying the sanctions imposed against Russia were not enough. [...] In 2014, McCain led the opposition to the appointments of Colleen Bell, Noah Mamet, and George Tsunis to the ambassadorships in Hungary, Argentina, and Norway, respectively, arguing they were unqualified appointees being rewarded for their political fundraising. [...] Unlike many Republicans, McCain supported the release and contents of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture in December 2014, saying [...] "The truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow. It sometimes causes us difficulties at home and abroad. It is sometimes used by our enemies in attempts to hurt us. But the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> entitled to it, nonetheless." [...] He added that the CIA's practices following the September 11 attacks had [...] "stained our national honor" [...] while doing [...] "much harm and little practical good" [...] and that [...] "Our enemies act without conscience. We must not." [...] He opposed the Obama administration's December 2014 decision to normalize relations with Cuba.|$|E
500|$|McCain did join Bush for a {{few days}} of {{appearances}} in late October, emphasizing, {{in the wake of the}} October 12 USS Cole bombing, his belief that Bush was a better choice than Democratic Party nominee Al Gore to deal with international security threats. [...] Bush aide Scott McClellan later described the joint appearances by saying, [...] "The tension was palpable. The two were cordial, but McCain would get that forced smile on his face whenever they were together." [...] McCain also campaigned for about forty Republican House of Representatives candidates, and was credited by National Republican Congressional Committee chair Tom Davis with keeping the House in Republican hands. [...] McCain would state that he voted for Bush on November 7 (although years later several witnesses would relate that McCain and his wife Cindy had both said at a dinner party that they had not). [...] When the November presidential election continued on in indecision during the Florida election dispute, McCain stayed generally quiet in an atmosphere of extreme partisanship, though he did appear on CBS' Face the Nation to say, [...] "I think the nation is growing a little weary of this. [...] We're not in a constitutional crisis, but the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> growing weary, and whoever wins is having a rapidly diminishing mandate, to say the least." [...] Once Bush was declared the winner and inaugurated in January 2001, McCain's battles with him would resume, with a significant amount of lingering bitterness between the two men and their staffs over what had transpired during the course of 2000.|$|E

2500|$|Current U.S. {{policy is}} not working, {{as the level of}} {{violence}} in Iraq is rising and the government is not advancing national reconciliation.

Our ability to respond to other international crises is constrained. A majority of the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> soured on the war. This level of expense is not sustainable over an extended period, especially when progress is not being made.

2500|$|On 16 September 2001, at Camp David, U.S. {{president}} George W.

[...] And the American people must be patient. [...] I'm going to be patient." [...] Shortly after, the White House said the president regretted use of the term crusade, as it might have been misunderstood as reference to the historical Crusades; the word crusade was not used again. On 20 September 2001, during a televised address to a joint session of Congress, George Bush said, [...] "Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there.

2500|$|Adorno's {{reputation}} as a musicologist has been in steady decline since his death. [...] His sweeping criticisms of jazz and championing of the Second Viennese School in opposition to Stravinsky have caused him {{to fall out of}} favour. [...] The distinguished American scholar Richard Taruskin declared Adorno to be [...] "preposterously over-rated." [...] The eminent pianist and critic Charles Rosen saw Adorno's book The Philosophy of New Music as [...] "largely a fraudulent presentation, a work of polemic that pretends to be an objective study." [...] Even a fellow Marxist such as the historian and jazz critic Eric Hobsbawm saw Adorno's writings as containing [...] "some of the stupidest pages ever written about jazz". The British philosopher Roger Scruton saw Adorno as producing [...] "reams of turgid nonsense devoted to showing that the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> just as alienated as Marxism requires them to be, and that their cheerful life-affirming music is a ‘fetishized’ commodity, expressive of their deep spiritual enslavement to the capitalist machine." [...] Irritation with Adorno's tunnel vision started even while he was alive. [...] He may have championed Schoenberg, but the composer notably failed to return the compliment: [...] "I {{have never been able to}} bear the fellow [...] It is disgusting, by the way, how he treats Stravinsky." [...] On the other hand, the scholar Slavoj Žižek has written a foreword to Adorno's In Search of Wagner, where Žižek attributes an [...] "emancipatory impulse" [...] to the same book, although Žižek suggests that fidelity to this impulse demands [...] "a betrayal of the explicit theses of Adorno's Wagner study." ...|$|E
