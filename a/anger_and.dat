The training was found to reduce recidivism from 37% to 21%, and the training was estimated as having saved the state $5 million per year in reduced incarceration costs. The training was found to increase equanimity, decrease <b>anger,</b> <b>and</b> lead to abilities to take responsibility for one's feelings, express empathy, and to make requests without imposing demands.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{historian}} R. Shaw-Smith {{points to}} letters of Augustus to Tiberius which display affection towards Tiberius and high regard for his military merits. Shotter states that Tiberius focused his <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> criticism on Gaius Asinius Gallus (for marrying Vipsania after Augustus forced Tiberius to divorce her), {{as well as}} toward the two young Caesars, Gaius and Lucius—instead of Augustus, the real architect of his divorce and imperial demotion.|$|E
5|$|As Griet cleans Vermeer's studio, {{which his}} wife Catharina (Essie Davis) never enters, the painter begins to {{converse}} with her and encourages her appreciation of painting, light and color. Vermeer gives her lessons in mixing paints and other tasks, taking care to keep this secret from his wife, who would react with <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> jealousy if she found out {{that her husband was}} spending time with Griet. In contrast, Vermeer's pragmatic mother-in-law, Maria Thins (Judy Parfitt), sees Griet as useful to Vermeer's career.|$|E

5|$|Dava Sobel {{argues that}} prior to Galileo's 1633 trial and {{judgement}} for heresy, Pope Urban VIII had become preoccupied with court intrigue and problems of state, and began to fear persecution or threats to his own life. In this context, Sobel argues {{that the problem of}} Galileo was presented to the pope by court insiders and enemies of Galileo. Having been accused of weakness in defending the church, Urban reacted against Galileo out of <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> fear.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
5|$|His {{primary focus}} was gay-themed writing, though {{he also wrote}} about the {{entertainment}} industry. Mostly satirical, his writing was filled with increasingly clear <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> disdain for the Republican neo-con agenda, especially after the AIDS pandemic began to take a large toll on the gay community. A very strong voice in gay literature, Baker had admirers and detractors for his gay radical stance, both in the mainstream literary {{community as well as}} the gay community itself.|$|E

5|$|Most of the population, {{urban and}} rural, took out their <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> frustrations on the nation's Vietnamese population. Lon Nol's call for 10,000 volunteers {{to boost the}} {{manpower}} of Cambodia's poorly equipped, 30,000-man army, managed to swamp the military with over 70,000 recruits. Rumours abounded concerning a possible PAVN offensive aimed at Phnom Penh itself. Paranoia flourished and this set off a violent reaction against the nation's 400,000 ethnic Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, some Roman writers, {{particularly}} Republican figures, used Alexander as {{a cautionary tale}} of how autocratic tendencies can be kept in check by republican values. Alexander was used by these writers {{as an example of}} ruler values such as amicita (friendship) and clementia (clemency), but also iracundia (<b>anger)</b> <b>and</b> cupiditas gloriae (over-desire for glory).|$|E

5|$|Roger's and his fellow-bishops' {{stories to}} Henry are {{often cited as}} the spark that touched off the king's anger at Becket and led to his martyrdom. However, it was more {{probably}} the stories of Becket's behaviour upon arrival in England that caused Henry's <b>anger,</b> <b>and</b> which indirectly led {{to the death of}} Becket. Roger was suspended by Pope Alexander III because he was implicated in Becket's death, but was restored to office on 16 December 1171.|$|E
5|$|The King's sudden {{onset of}} {{insanity}} {{was seen by}} some as a sign of divine <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> punishment, and by others as the result of magic. Modern historians speculate that he may have suffered from the onset of paranoid schizophrenia. The comatose king was returned to Le Mans, where Guillaume de Harsigny—a venerated and well-educated 92-year-old physician—was summoned to treat him. Charles regained consciousness and his fever subsided; he was gradually returned to Paris in September.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{consensus is}} that responsibility or guilt for the war was not attached to the article. Rather, the clause was a prerequisite to allow a legal basis to be laid out for the reparation payments that were to be made. Historians have also highlighted the unintended damage created by the clause, which caused <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> resentment amongst the German population.|$|E

5|$|After Méliès's {{financial}} difficulties and decline, most {{copies of his}} prints were lost. In 1917, his offices were occupied by the French military, who melted down many of Méliès's films to gather the traces of silver from the film stock and make boot heels from the celluloid. When the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was demolished in 1923, the prints kept there were sold by weight to a vendor of second-hand film. Finally, in that same year, Méliès had a moment of <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> burned all his remaining negatives in his garden in Montreuil. In 1925, he began selling toys and candy from a stand in the Gare Montparnasse in Paris. A Trip to the Moon was largely forgotten to history and went unseen for years.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the protagonists}} {{in the novel}} are misfits and social outcasts {{surrounded}} by an impersonal and largely antagonistic rural community, which is represented metonymically through minor or anonymous characters. Joanna Burden and Reverend Hightower are hounded {{by the people of}} Jefferson for years, in a failed effort to make them leave town. Byron Bunch, though more accepted in Jefferson, is still viewed as a mystery or simply overlooked. Both Joe Christmas and Lena Grove are orphans, strangers in town, and social outcasts, though the former draws <b>anger</b> <b>and</b> violence from the community, while the latter is looked down upon but receives generous assistance in her travels. According to Cleanth Brooks, this opposition between Joe and Lena is a pastoral reflection of the full spectrum of social alienation in modern society.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} stylistic {{influence was}} the experimental oeuvre of Kenneth <b>Anger,</b> <b>and</b> in particular Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome. Noé saw Anger's {{films in the}} early 1990s, while promoting the short film Carne, and quickly became a fan. Other influences from experimental cinema included the works of Jordan Belson and Peter Tscherkassky. Noé's favourite film, , was the most prominent influence among mainstream films; Noé {{wanted to become a}} filmmaker after he saw it at the age of seven. Brian De Palma's Snake Eyes and other films which feature hovering overhead shots inspired Noé to make a film largely from such a perspective.|$|E
