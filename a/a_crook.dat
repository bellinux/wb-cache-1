5|$|Cricket was {{probably}} devised by children and survived for many generations as essentially a children's game. Possibly it {{was derived from}} bowls, assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman {{trying to stop the}} ball reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep's wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or <b>a</b> <b>crook</b> or another farm tool as the bat; and a gate (e.g., a wicket gate), a stool or a tree stump as the wicket. The invention of the game could have happened in Norman or Plantagenet times anytime before 1300; or even in Saxon times before 1066.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} believed that cricket survived as a children's game for many generations {{before it was}} increasingly taken up by adults around {{the beginning of the}} 17th century.

25|$|During this period, Overturf {{was very}} active in {{government}} and community affairs. In 1907, he {{was appointed to the}} vacant city treasurer position in Bend. A month later, he was elected city treasure by a vote of 62 to 1. In 1909, he was elected to a two-year term on Bend city council. After leaving the city council in 1911, Overturf was re-elected to the city treasurer position by a vote of 179 to 115. In 1915, Overturf was appointed to fill a vacant Crook County commissioner position. Later that year, he was elected to a full term as commissioner by a vote of 830 to 730. In 1916, Overturf ran for re-election to the county commission, but lost by a vote of 1,946 to 1,802. However, in the same election, voters approved a ballot measure that created Deschutes County, separating the new county from Crook County. As a result, Overturf’s defeat avoided a problem that would have arisen because he resided in the newly formed Deschutes County; and therefore, was not qualified to serve as <b>a</b> <b>Crook</b> County commissioner.|$|E

40|$|Dedicated to {{the memory}} of Robert Miner Abstract. We develop the Lorentzian {{geometry}} of <b>a</b> <b>crooked</b> half-space in 2 + 1 -dimensional Minkowski space. We calculate the affine, conformal and isometric automorphism groups of <b>a</b> <b>crooked</b> halfspace, and discuss its stratification into orbit types, giving an explicit slice for the action of the automorphism group. The set of parallelism classes of timelike lines, or particles, in <b>a</b> <b>crooked</b> halfs-pace is <b>a</b> geodesic halfplane in the hyperbolic plane. Every point in <b>an</b> open <b>crooked</b> halfspace lies on a particle. The correspondence between crooked halfspaces and halfplanes in hyperbolic 2 -space preserves the partial order defined by inclusion, and the involu-tion defined by complementarity. We find conditions for when a particle lies completely in <b>a</b> <b>crooked</b> half space. We revisit the disjointness criterion for crooked planes developed by Drumm and Goldman in terms of the semigroup of translations preserving <b>a</b> <b>crooked</b> halfspace. These ideas are then applied to describe folia-tions of Minkowski space by crooked planes...|$|R

500|$|Maxwell {{bought the}} Mirror Group in 1986 and floated it in May 1991, {{appointing}} Clark {{to the board}} of directors. Maxwell claimed that the offer he made Clark would appeal to even a [...] "one-eyed Bulgarian peasant". Clark claimed that he tried to make Maxwell follow conventional business practices and remained convinced that [...] "until quite close to the end, he never did anything I asked him not to do". It was only after Maxwell's unusual death on 5 November 1991 that financial mismanagement of the Mirror Group came to light. There was evidence of 29 unusual payments of £230 million from Mirror to other Maxwell companies within one year in a fraud that eventually cost the company, and its pension fund, £492 million. Clark claimed that there had been no evidence for the directors to act on against Maxwell, telling the shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) that [...] "No system of internal control, however elaborate, can stop fraudulent collusion by a group of individuals holding authority and trust. None of us [...] would have taken on the job had we thought Maxwell was <b>a</b> <b>crook.</b> How many can stand up and say: 'We said he was <b>a</b> <b>crook</b> a year ago'?" [...] Clark's position was disputed by the Department of Trade and Industry, which determined that the two non-executive directors, Clark and Alan Clements, should have questioned the payments. At the EGM Clark almost lost his usual polite nature when he was accused of being a Maxwell [...] "crony" [...] by Rupert Allason and had to rule a no-confidence vote as out of order.|$|E

According to later writer James Neff, [...] "When local government did not function, the Press struck with editorial might, {{even if it meant}} using a sledgehammer to crush a gnat. Overkill could be rationalized because the cause was just, for the little guy. Anyone who tried to play outside these rules or who was perceived as looking down on his mostly blue-collar readers, Seltzer enjoyed taking down a peg".|$|E

Terence Pettigrew mentions a [...] "witty scene" [...] featuring Bernard Lee in the film {{in which he is}} [...] "struggling to put on a tight collar prior to slipping into town for a few ales." [...] Although Lee was in wartime service in the army between 1940 and 1946, he had managed to act in several films earlier which were released between 1939 and 1943, including Murder in Soho, The Frozen Limits, Let George Do It!

As his film career failed to take off, Madhavan went on to feature in Hindi television serials, appearing as <b>a</b> <b>crook</b> in his first venture Yule Love Stories. He appeared in leading roles in Zee TV's Banegi Apni Baat and Ghar Jamai, while he gained further popularity portraying the character of Shekhar in Saaya.

His first appearance in a feature film role came through a small role in Is Raat Ki Subah Nahin (1996), where he portrayed a singer in a bar.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Isn't This a Lovely Day (to be Caught in the Rain)", while Rogers is out riding, a {{thunderstorm}} breaks {{and she takes}} shelter in a bandstand. Astaire follows her and a conversation about clouds and rainfall soon gives way to Astaire's rendering of this, one of Berlin's most prized creations. Astaire sings to Rogers' back, but the audience can see that Rogers' attitude towards him softens during the song, {{and the purpose of}} the ensuing dance is for her to communicate this change to her partner. The dance is one of flirtation and, according to Mueller, deploys two choreographic devices common to the classical minuet: sequential imitation (one dancer performs a step and the other responds) and touching. Initially, the imitation is mocking in character, then becomes more of a casual exchange, and ends in a spirit of true cooperation. Until the last thirty seconds of this two and a half minute dance the pair appear to pull back from touching, then with <b>a</b> <b>crook</b> of her elbow Rogers invites Astaire in. The routine, at once comic and romantic, incorporates hopping steps, tap spins with barrages, loping and dragging steps among its many innovative devices. The spirit of equality which pervades the dance is reflected in the masculinity of Rogers' clothes and in the friendly handshake they exchange at the end.|$|E

Stopping at the Contemporary, which was hosting the 1973 Annual Convention of the Associated Press Managing Editors Association, the president held a live one-hour televised press conference in the Ballroom of the Americas. Following an earlier question by Joe Ungaro on Nixon's taxes, Nixon decided to address claims that he profited from his public service, stating [...] "I have earned every cent.
