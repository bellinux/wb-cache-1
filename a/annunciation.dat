5|$|In Leipzig, the Magnificat was {{regularly}} part of Sunday services, sung in German on ordinary Sundays {{but more}} elaborately and in Latin {{on the high}} holidays (Christmas, Easter and Pentecost) and on the three Marian feasts <b>Annunciation,</b> Visitation and Purification.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, Greek Orthodox churches {{beginning}} in the 1950s tended to use a large central dome with a ring of windows at its base evocative of the central dome of Hagia Sophia, rather than more recent or more historically common Byzantine types, such as the Greek-cross-octagon or five-domed quincunx plans. Examples include <b>Annunciation</b> Greek Orthodox Church, completed in 1961 but designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1957, Ascension Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Oakland (1960), and <b>Annunciation</b> Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Atlanta (1967). The use of a large central dome in American Greek Orthodox churches continued in the 1960s and 1970s before moving toward smaller Middle Byzantine domes, or versions of Early Christian basilicas.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Annunciation</b> was {{a popular}} theme in European art, {{although}} a difficult scene to paint, because it depicts Mary's union with Christ as she becomes the tabernacle for the Word made flesh. Mary as Theotokos, the God-bearer, was affirmed in 431 at the Council of Ephesus; two decades later the Council of Chalcedon affirmed the doctrine of Incarnation– that Christ was of two natures (God and Man)– and her perpetual virginity was affirmed at the Lateran Council of 631. In Byzantine art, <b>Annunciation</b> scenes depict the Virgin enthroned and dressed in royal regalia. In later centuries she was shown in enclosed spaces: the temple, the church, the garden.|$|E
5|$|The {{epilogue}} is {{the only}} part of the film in colour and shows time-aged, but still vibrant, details of several of Andrei Rublev’s actual icons.

25|$|Leonardo studied linear {{perspective}} and employed {{it in his}} earlier paintings. His use of perspective in the two <b>Annunciations</b> is daring, as he uses various features such as {{the corner of a}} building, a walled garden and a path to contrast enclosure and spaciousness.|$|R

5|$|A {{brain and}} a subtle ear {{has gone into}} the making of this poem...celebrating the mystery of Christ's conception. Dew falling on grass, flower and spray (traditional imagery, {{deriving}} from OT texts such as Psalm 72:6) suggests ease, grace and delicacy generally (not progressive stages of insemination).

500|$|Leonardo first gained notoriety for {{his work}} on the Baptism of Christ, painted in {{conjunction}} with Verrocchio. Two other paintings appear to date from his time at Verrocchio's workshop, both of which are <b>Annunciations.</b> One is small, [...] long and [...] high. It is a [...] "predella" [...] to go {{at the base of a}} larger composition, a painting by Lorenzo di Credi from which it has become separated. The other is a much larger work, [...] long. In both <b>Annunciations,</b> Leonardo used a formal arrangement, like two well-known pictures by Fra Angelico of the same subject, of the Virgin Mary sitting or kneeling to the right of the picture, approached from the left by an angel in profile, with a rich flowing garment, raised wings and bearing a lily. Although previously attributed to Ghirlandaio, the larger work is now generally attributed to Leonardo.|$|R

50|$|James Hayward (born 1943, San Francisco, California) is a {{contemporary}} abstract painter who {{lives and works}} in Moorpark, California. Hayward's paintings are usually divided in two bodies of work: flat paintings (1975-1984) and thick paintings (1984 to the present). He works in series, some of which are ongoing, and include The <b>Annunciations,</b> The Stations of the Cross, the Red Maps, Fire Paintings, Smoke Paintings, Sacred and Profane and Nothing's Perfect series.|$|R

5|$|In the {{fortified}} suburb are {{the minimal}} remains of two more significant structures. One was a sacral complex, Blagoveštenjska crkva (<b>Annunciation</b> Church), where the Saint's relics were stored.

5|$|The Greek Orthodox Church of the <b>Annunciation,</b> Manchester {{was founded}} in 1861, in Broughton.

It replaced an earlier place of worship on Cheetham Hill Road, and an earlier chapel on Wellington Street. It is the oldest purpose-built Orthodox church in the country.|$|E
50|$|The Iconography {{contains}} religious symbolism, {{although their}} extent and exact nature is much debated - Meyer Schapiro pioneered {{the study of}} the symbolism of the mousetrap, and Erwin Panofsky later extended, or perhaps over-extended, the analysis of symbols to cover many more details of the furniture and fittings. Similar debates exist for many Early Netherlandish paintings, and a number of the details seen for the first time here reappear in later <b>Annunciations</b> by other artists.|$|R
60|$|The speech produced, {{as might}} have been expected, a great {{division}} among the hearers. Some were more angry than ever, and were eager to put the prophet to death.

Jeremiah was set at liberty, and continued his earnest expostulations with the people on account of their sins, and his terrible <b>annunciations</b> of the impending ruin of the city just as before.|$|R

5|$|The {{two small}} upper {{register}} panels show a rather traditional <b>Annunciation</b> scene, {{with the usual}} dove representing the Holy Spirit near Mary.

5|$|Bach had an {{audience}} {{familiar with the}} text and its background. In Leipzig, a Latin Magnificat was sung on the high holidays (Christmas, Easter and Pentecost, then performed {{on two of the}} three days of celebration) and on the three Marian feasts <b>Annunciation,</b> Visitation and Purification. According to some scholars, further feast days included New Year's Day, Epiphany, Feast of the Ascension, Trinity Sunday, St. John's Day and St. Michael's Day, and the vespers before the feast days.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the three}} narthex entrances sits below a tympanum. These 3 tympana were {{designed}} and sculpted by John Angel. The tympanum above the main, west entrance depicts Jesus {{as described in the}} Book of Revelation, together with the four beasts and other relevant iconography. It resembles the tympanum of the Royal Portal of Chartres Cathedral. Beneath the figure of Christ is Princeton University's shield, illustrating the university's motto, Dei sub numine viget ("Under the power of God she flourishes"). The tympana above the north and south entrances depict the <b>Annunciation</b> and the Baptism of Christ, respectively.|$|E
40|$|Proceeding {{from the}} {{statement}} that «reading» images {{is not at all}} analogous to any culturally codified lecture of written texts, Sigrid Weigel develops a crucial critic of the anthropological paradigm linked to the left-right problem in the visual arts. Focusing on various examples of painted and sculpted <b>Annunciations,</b> the author argues how the decline of the traditional orientation, based on the figure of God in central position, leads to a growing importance of the spectator gaze and to a new relation between iconic narration and symbolic meaning...|$|R

60|$|Vasari, in his {{notice of}} one of Giotto's <b>Annunciations,</b> praises him for having justly {{rendered}} {{the fear of the}} Virgin at the address of the Angel. If he ever treated the subject in such a manner, he departed from all the traditions of his time; for I am aware of no painting of this scene, {{during the course of the}} thirteenth and following centuries, which does not represent the Virgin as perfectly tranquil, receiving the message of the Angel in solemn thought and gentle humility, but without a shadow of fear. It was reserved for the painters of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to change angelic majesty into reckless impetuosity, and maiden meditation into panic dread.|$|R
5|$|George Washington was {{the first}} child of Augustine Washington (1694–1743) and his second wife Mary Ball Washington (1708–1789), born on their Pope's Creek Estate near present-day Colonial Beach in Westmoreland County, Virginia. He was born on February 11, 1731, {{according}} to the Julian calendar and <b>Annunciation</b> Style of enumerating years then in use in the British Empire. The Gregorian calendar was adopted within the British Empire in 1752, and it renders a birth date of February 22, 1732.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{appear in}} art, either to {{illustrate}} their botanical appearance, {{or for the}} purposes of the artist, which may include decoration or religious symbolism. For example, the Virgin Mary was compared by the Venerable Bede to a lily, the white petals denoting purity of body, while the yellow anthers signified the radiant light of the soul; accordingly, European portraits of the Virgin's <b>Annunciation</b> may depict a vase of white lilies in her room to indicate her attributes. Plants are also often used as backgrounds or features in portraits, and as main subjects in still lifes.|$|E

Today these continue merely as dynastic {{orders of the}} Royal House in Exile. While their bestowal is suppressed by law in Italy, the use of those decorations conferred prior to 1951 is recognised, exclusive of any right of precedence in official ceremonies.|$|E
40|$|From the {{perspective}} of information theory and cryptography, we analyze the security of two quantum dialogue protocols and a bidirectional quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) protocol, and {{point out that the}} transmitted information would be partly leaked out in them.

This phenomenon should have been strictly forbidden in a quantum secure communication. In fact, this problem exists in quite a few recent proposals and, therefore, it deserves more research attention in the following related study. Comment: An authors' note was added.

25|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{icon of the}} Virgin Mary, {{of about}} 600 from Saint Catherine's Monastery, has an often overlooked hand, suggesting to Robin Cormack that the emphasis of the subject is on the Incarnation rather than a simple Virgin and Child. Another {{of the very few}} major Eastern works showing the Virgin from before the Byzantine iconoclasm, an apse mosaic (lost in 1922) from Nicaea, also shows the hand above a standing Virgin. Few similar uses of the hand are seen in later Virgins, though the iconographically adventurous Byzantine Chludov Psalter (9th century) has a small miniature showing the hand and dove above a Virgin & Child. The hand occasionally appears in Western <b>Annunciations,</b> even as late as Simone Martini in the 14th century, by which time the dove, sometimes accompanied by a small image of God the Father, has become more common.|$|R
