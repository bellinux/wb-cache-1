30|$|Linear-slip theory {{considers}} that <b>a</b> <b>fracture</b> is <b>a</b> uniquely thin layer surrounded by two-dimensional infinite faces.

Suppose that the stress across <b>a</b> <b>fracture</b> is quite high, ten times larger across it compared to undisturbed rocks around a fracture; suppose that there is a linear relationship between displacement across <b>a</b> <b>fracture</b> plane and stresses on <b>a</b> <b>fracture</b> plane; and suppose that displacement across <b>a</b> <b>fracture</b> plane is discontinuous, without a change to rotation.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Eleven {{patients}} who had sustained <b>a</b> periprosthetie <b>fracture</b> of the acetabulum at a mean of 6. 2 years (range, one month to thirteen years) after a total hip arthroplasty were managed at our institution between 1985 and 1991. Five patients had <b>a</b> <b>fracture</b> of the medial wall; three, <b>a</b> <b>fracture</b> of the posterior col-umn; two, a transverse fracture; and one, <b>a</b> <b>fracture</b> of the anterior column. Six fractures were displaced by two millimeters or more. Eight fractures were caused by blunt trauma or a fall, and three occurred sponta-neously. <b>A</b> <b>fracture</b> was classified as type 1 if the ace-tabular component was clinically and radiographically stable (eight patients) and as type 2 if the component was unstable (three patients). One patient, who had a displaced type- 2 fracture o...|$|R
5|$|Hextall's first {{international}} recognition {{came when he}} was named as part of Team Canada's squad for the 1987 Canada Cup. During a practice session, he chopped Sylvain Turgeon's arm with his stick during a scrimmage, claiming that the left wing {{was too close to}} the goal. Turgeon missed the tournament with <b>a</b> <b>fractured</b> arm; Hextall was back-up to Grant Fuhr and did not play a single game. He later represented Canada in the 1992 World Championships, playing five games to record one win and a GAA of 2.86 as Canada were eliminated in the quarter-finals.|$|E

Between 16 and 25 September, Marseille {{failed to}} increase his score due to <b>a</b> <b>fractured</b> arm, sustained in a force landing soon after the 15 September mission.

But the same day, Marseille borrowed the Macchi C.202 '96–10' of the Italian ace Tenente Emanuele Annoni, from 96a Squadriglia, 9° Gruppo, 4° Stormo, based at Fuka, for a test flight.

5|$|On 2 December 1956, outside Satara, India, the car {{in which}} Baba was being driven went {{out of control and}} a second serious {{automobile}} accident occurred.

Despite his physicians' predictions to the contrary, after great effort Baba managed to walk again, but from that point on he was in constant pain and was severely limited in his ability to move. In fact, during his trip to the West in 1958 he often needed to be carried from venue to venue.|$|E

Acting on {{the advice}} of his {{navigator}} Leutnant Niehoff, dropped down towards cloud layers. The cover, however, quickly dispersed. Their gunners were killed, Lehmkul was hit in the back by machine gun fire and was wounded while Niehoff suffered <b>a</b> <b>fractured</b> spine during the crash–landing. Debate continues to this day as to which squadron or pilot was the victor. Post–war sources credit the victory to McKellar. It was also the War's first German aircraft shot down onto British soil.|$|E
40|$|Background: Type- 1 and type- 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is {{associated}} with <b>an</b> increased <b>fracture</b> risk and possibly {{an increased risk of}} death following <b>a</b> <b>fracture.</b> Aim: To investigate the association between diabetes related drugs and mortality following <b>a</b> <b>fracture.</b> Methods: <b>A</b> nested case-control study was conducted. Cases were patients with DM who died following a fracture; controls were DM patients not dying after <b>a</b> <b>fracture.</b> We identified DM patients using the Danish National Hospital Discharge Register (1977 - 2011) and included information on date of DM diagnosis, date of fracture and comorbidities. From the Danish Cause of Death Register the date of death was collected (2008 - 2011). From the Central Region of Jutland, Denmark, medication use was collected (2008 - 2011). Analysis was performed by unconditional logistic regression. Results: 2, 621 diabetes patients with <b>a</b> <b>fracture</b> following the diabetes diagnosis and with information on medication use were included. Of these 229 died. In a multivariate analysis, statin use (n= 1, 106 (42 %) statin users, odds ratio (OR) = 0. 60, 95 % confidence interval, p= 0. 012) decreased the risk of dying subsequent to <b>a</b> <b>fracture.</b> Male gender (OR= 1. 57, p= 0. 005), increasing age (OR= 1. 08, p< 0. 001), a diagnosis of retinopathy (OR= 2. 12, p= 0. 008), heart failure (OR= 1. 68, p= 0. 004) and use of glucocorticoids (OR= 2. 22, p= 0. 001) were associated with an increased risk of death. None of the antidiabetics; biguanides, glucagon-like receptor agonists, β-cell stimulants, glitazones, and insulin were associated with mortality. Conclusion: Co-morbidity reflected by late onset complications, heart failure and glucocorticoid use was associated with an increased risk of mortality subsequent to <b>a</b> <b>fracture.</b> Statin use may reduce mortality subsequent to <b>a</b> <b>fracture</b> in diabetes patients. Clinical trials are needed to determine whether diabetes patients with <b>a</b> <b>fracture</b> should initiate statin treatment...|$|R
