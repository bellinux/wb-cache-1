5|$|Sargent's own composition, Impression on <b>a</b> <b>Windy</b> Day, {{has been}} {{recorded}} for CD by the Royal Ballet Sinfonia conducted by Gavin Sutherland on the ASV label. Sargent's first recordings as a conductor, made for HMV in 1923 using the acoustic process, were of excerpts from Vaughan Williams's opera Hugh the Drover. In {{the early days of}} electrical recording, he took part in a pioneering live recording of extracts of Mendelssohn's Elijah at the Albert Hall with the Royal Choral Society.|$|E
5|$|Sargent's break {{came when}} Sir Henry Wood visited De Montfort Hall, Leicester, early in 1921 with the Queen's Hall orchestra. As it was {{customary}} to commission a piece {{from a local}} composer, Wood invited Sargent to write a piece entitled Impression on <b>a</b> <b>Windy</b> Day. Sargent completed the work too late for Wood to {{have enough time to}} learn it, and so Wood called on Sargent to conduct the first performance himself. Wood recognised not only the worth of the piece but also Sargent's talent as a conductor and gave him the chance to make his debut conducting the work at Wood's annual season of promenade concerts, generally known as the Proms, in the Queen's Hall on 11 October of the same year.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year Patton came second to Michael Rodgers {{in a close}} 100m race at the 2009 US championships in June, running <b>a</b> <b>windy</b> 9.92 seconds. This won him {{a place on the}} American team for the 2009 World Championships in Athletics. Prior to the event, he was runner-up in Monaco and in Stockholm – running a wind-assisted 9.95 seconds behind Tyson Gay at the latter. He managed to reach the final of the men's 100 meters after scoring a season's best of 9.98 in the semi-finals. He performed poorly in the final however, finishing last with a slow time of 10.34seconds due to an injury. The hopes of the American men's relay team were again dashed by an illegal baton exchange, this time between Patton and Shawn Crawford. Patton ended his season on a high: he ran a series of sub-10 runs including 9.95 for third at the Weltklasse, 9.94 to win the Hanžeković Memorial, and a personal record-equalling run of 9.89seconds for third at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix, behind Tyson Gay and Asafa Powell. He also placed third in the 100m at the Memorial Van Damme and the 2009 IAAF World Athletics Final.|$|E

He was [...]14 seconds ahead of the second place Gatlin, who ran a season best of 9.89 seconds.|$|E
500|$|Due {{to surface}} friction, the inflow only {{partially}} conserves angular momentum. [...] Thus, the sea surface lower boundary acts {{as both a}} source (evaporation) and sink (friction) of energy for the system. This fact leads {{to the existence of}} a theoretical upper bound on the strongest wind speed that a tropical cyclone can attain. Because evaporation increases linearly with wind speed (just as climbing out of a pool feels much colder on <b>a</b> <b>windy</b> day), there is a positive feedback on energy input into the system known as the Wind-Induced Surface Heat Exchange (WISHE) feedback. This feedback is offset when frictional dissipation, which increases with the cube of the wind speed, becomes sufficiently large.|$|E
500|$|The title Four Quartets {{connects to}} music, which appears also in Eliot's poems [...] "Preludes", [...] "Rhapsody on <b>a</b> <b>Windy</b> Night", and [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] {{along with a}} 1942 lecture called [...] "The Music of Poetry". Some critics have {{suggested}} that there were various classical works that Eliot focused on while writing the pieces. In particular, within literary criticism there is an emphasis on Beethoven serving as a model, although these claims rarely have much substance. The purpose of the quartet was to have multiple themes that intertwined with each other. Each section, as in the musical image, would be distinct even though they share the same performance. East Coker and The Dry Salvages are written {{in such a way}} as to make the poems continuous and create a [...] "double-quartet".|$|E

50|$|In a still environment, {{the areas}} under the leaves/spines where {{transpiration}} {{is taking place}} form a small localised environment that is more saturated than normal with water vapour. If this is not blown away by wind, the water vapour potential gradient is reduced and so is transpiration. Thus, in <b>a</b> <b>windier</b> situation, this localization is not held and so the gradient remains high, which aids the loss of water vapour. Spines trap a layer of moisture and also slow air movement over tissues.|$|R

According to sportswriter Doyle Dietz, in the Jets' upset victory (the Colts were favored by as many as 19½ points), [...] "the American Football League came of age". Madden later stated that the Jets' Super Bowl upset [...] "was great for the history of the game, but a part of me has always felt that should have been [...] who were the first AFL team to do it ... changed pro football.

Vinokourov won stage 3 of the Tour of the Basque Country with a [...] long solo attack. Kreuziger took his first win of the season at the Giro del Trentino, winning the fourth and final stage. He also was first over the day's last two climbs, which gave him enough points to win the mountains classification. The squad also won the teams classification.|$|E
500|$|In 1520 the confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament (...) was {{entrusted}} with the church's care. The confraternity originated in Borgo in 1509. On <b>a</b> <b>windy</b> evening of 1506, a Carmelite {{coming from the}} old Santa Maria in Traspontina church (lying near Castel Sant'Angelo), followed by a lay brother bearing a candle, was bringing the sacramental bread to a sick person. Since the wind had extinguished the candle, the layman went into a nearby shop asking for fire, so that the priest was left alone. At {{the sight of the}} lone priest bearing the blessed Sacrament, several passers-by were moved, gathered around him and accompanied him, bearing a baldachin and torches. The group grew, and on 3 September 1509 its members formed a compagnia. The Carmelites assigned it to a chapel in Santa Maria in Traspontina, and in 1513 Pope Leo X (r. 1513–21) acknowledged the association, which in 1520 moved to San Giacomo.|$|E

500|$|The zduhaći, {{the dragon}} men, {{and the related}} folkloric figures of Europe can be {{compared}} with Eurasian shamans, e.g., the noaidi of the Lapps, {{as well as the}} shamans of the Samoyeds and Tungus in Siberia. They were all able to leave their body in spirit to fight against the enemies of their community. The shamans also fought against each other, usually in animal form, for reasons such as to procure for their side as much reindeer as possible. However, for a shaman's soul to leave his body, he had to work himself into a state of ecstasy through a ceremony consisting of drumming, dancing, chanting, and even taking narcotics. All the zduhaći had to do was to fall asleep, although the unusual depth of their sleep indicates a state of ecstasy. There are detailed and eventful descriptions of the journey of the shaman's soul, but no corresponding accounts exist {{in the case of the}} zduhaći. However, the zduhaći who left their bodies were said to have gone into the winds. This expression may contain an idea of a journey.

500|$|When an attack, contact or {{sighting}} {{was reported}} a siren would sound throughout {{the base and}} the troopers would rush out to react in two [...] "Waves". The First Wave of 32 soldiers would be transported to the area aboard Alouette III helicopters, commonly called [...] "G-cars", and would {{be accompanied by a}} further Alouette III, acting as command gunship (or [...] "K-car") and a Cessna Skymaster (or [...] "Lynx") light support aircraft. Each Alouette could carry a [...] "stick" [...] of four soldiers, so on Fireforce the First Wave was organised into eight four-man [...] "stops". The remainder of the Commando, the Second Wave, would either be carried by the same aircraft, which returned to collect them, or move by truck {{at the same time as}} the First Wave. The object of Fireforce was to quickly trap and wipe out guerrilla groups before they could evacuate the area, so the element of surprise was important, but this was difficult to maintain because of the noise of an Alouette III's jet engine; on <b>a</b> <b>windy</b> day in the quiet bush, an Alouette III can be heard [...] many kilometres away. Hearing the Fireforce coming from this distance would give the cadres plenty of time to hide themselves, so the RhAF pilots would attempt to approach their targets heading upwind to minimise this effect.|$|E
500|$|Sawtooth National Forest has {{an active}} Fire Management Program which {{recognize}}s that forest fires are {{a natural part}} of the ecosystem, but this was not always the case. The 1987 forest plan did not recognize fire as an ecosystem process or as a tool for ecosystem management; this was rectified in the 2012 forest plan. Previous firefighting efforts, which emphasized quickly extinguishing all fires, caused dead and dying trees to accumulate well in excess of the level found when fires are allowed to burn out naturally. Historically speaking, fires became more common in parts of the SNRA after the development of lodgepole pine forests, which occurred prior to 1450AD. Between 1989 and 1998 there were on average 50 fires per year, with 58 percent of them caused by lightning. The Smoky Mountains of Idaho were named from the frequent forest fires, and in 2007 the Castle Rock Fire burned [...] of the Smoky Mountains near Ketchum. In 2005 the Valley Road Fire burned [...] in the White Cloud Mountains after being ignited from embers that came from a trash barrel which were blown out on <b>a</b> <b>windy</b> day. In August 2013 the Beaver Creek Fire and the Kelley Fire were both ignited by lightning and burned [...] and , respectively, of the Fairfield and Ketchum ranger districts. Another lightning-caused fire, the McCan Fire, burned [...] of the Fairfield Ranger District and other lands north of Fairfield in 2013. Both natural and prescribed fires are used as a tool to maintain desired vegetation and fuel levels. While the forest's fire plan operates within historical fire regimes, locally fire is actively suppressed to protect human life, investments, and resources.|$|E

500|$|Given his {{brilliance}} in {{home games}} in 1962, {{it was no}} surprise that Pierce was chosen to start the Giants' home opener in 1963, and he responded with the last shutout of his career – a 7–0 win over the Houston Colt [...]45s. He achieved his Candlestick success despite often discarding one of his primary pitches, the low curve, saying, [...] "How many left-handers come into this park and win with that pitch on <b>a</b> <b>windy</b> afternoon?" [...] He instead altered the location of his pitches, throwing outside to left-handers to get them to hit to left field, taking advantage of the wind which kept the ball in the air longer; two-time AL batting champion Pete Runnels observed that Pierce pitched to him completely differently upon changing leagues. His home win streak ended in his next start on April 20, a 4–0 loss to the Chicago Cubs; he gradually moved to the bullpen {{over the course of the}} 1963 season, and was used almost exclusively in relief in 1964. On September 10, 1964 against the Dodgers, in what was later called [...] "Billy the Kid's last fight," [...] he made his first start in over a year and the last of his career, pitching 7⅔ innings and gaining a 5–1 win. He made one more appearance in relief on October 3, falling one strikeout short of 2,000, and announced his retirement the next day as the season came to an end. In an 18-season career, Pierce posted a 211–169 record with a 3.27 ERA in 3,306⅔ innings; only twice (1948 and 1963) did he post an ERA of 4.00 or higher, and never in a season of at least 100 innings. He completed 193 of his 432 starts, including 38 shutouts, and also had 32 saves among his 585 total games pitched. His 186 career victories with the White Sox rank fourth on the club's all-time list, behind Hall of Famers Ted Lyons, Red Faber and Ed Walsh. His White Sox record of 456 career games by a left-hander was broken by Wilbur Wood in 1974.|$|E
500|$|Measuring [...] {{in length}} with a [...] {{wingspan}} and weighing around , the adult Australian raven is an all black-bird {{with a black}} beak, mouth and tongue and sturdy black or grey-black legs and feet. The tibia is fully feathered and the tarsus is long, and the feet large and strong. It has white irises. The plumage is glossy with a blue-purple to blue-green sheen, greenish over the ear coverts, depending on light. The underparts are not glossy. The Australian raven has throat feathers (hackles) that are [...] with rounded tips, while the other four species of Australian corvids have bifurcate tips, though this {{can be difficult to}} see in the field. The hackles are also longer than those of the other four species; when they are raised (such as when the bird is calling), they give the bird an unusual bearded appearance. The upper third of the upper mandible, including the nares and nasal groove, is covered with bristles, which can be up to [...] long. The heavy-set beak is tipped with a slight hook, and is longer than the bird's head. The wings are long and broad, with the longest of its ten primary feathers (usually the seventh but occasionally the eighth) almost reaching the end of the tail when the bird is at rest. The tail is rounded or wedge-shaped. The Australian raven can be distinguished from the two species of crow occurring in Australia by the grey base of the feathers, which is white in the latter species. The demarcation between pale and black regions on the feather is gradual in the ravens and sharply delineated in the crows. Feather bases are not normally visible when observing birds in the field, but can sometimes be seen on <b>a</b> <b>windy</b> day if the feathers are ruffled. Unlike the other four species, the Australian raven has a bare patch of skin under, and extending to beside, the bill. This can be hard to discern in the field. The three species of raven are more heavily set with a broader chest than the two crow species, with the forest raven the stockiest of all. Relative size of species is only useful when two species can be seen side by side, as the overlap in size is large and the difference in size small.|$|E
