50|$|Likewise, in {{the design}} of its twin-loop frame, as well as its overall styling, the W1 {{motorcycle}} was clearly influenced by classic British road bikes, including shifting with the right foot and braking with the left. From 1966 to 1968 W1 engines were built with a single 31 mm Mikuni carburetor (this is only feasible in a straight-twin with a 360° crankshaft angle). Starting in 1968, the W1SS with two 28 mm Mikuni carbs took the place of the original W1. Also in 1968, the W2 (<b>aka</b> <b>Commander)</b> emerged. The W2SS was a restyled W1SS with slightly more horsepower, and the W2TT was a high-pipe version with twin mufflers on the left side. Due to flat sales in North America the W2TT was discontinued in 1969, the W2SS ended in 1970, and finally in 1971 Kawasaki axed the W1SS.|$|R

5000|$|The {{reliance}} upon Hiwis {{exposed a}} gap between Nazi ideologues and pragmatic German Army <b>commanders.</b> <b>Nazi</b> leaders including Adolf Hitler regarded all Soviets as Untermenschen and therefore of limited value as volunteers also. On the other hand, the manpower was needed, and German Intelligence had recognised the need to divide the Soviet nationals. The contradiction was sometimes disguised by reclassification of Soviets as Cossacks. Colonel Helmuth Groscurth (Chief of Staff, XI Corps) wrote to General Beck: [...] "It is disturbing that {{we are forced to}} strengthen our fighting troops with Russian prisoners of war, who are already being turned into gunners. Its an odd state of affairs that the [...] "Beasts" [...] we have been fighting against are now living with us in closest harmony." [...] The Hiwis may have constituted one quarter of 6th Armys front-line strength, amounting to over 50,000 Soviet auxiliaries serving with the German troops.|$|R
