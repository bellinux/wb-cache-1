5|$|Henri L'Estrange, {{known as}} the Australian Blondin, was an Australian {{successful}} funambulist and <b>accident</b> <b>prone</b> aeronautical balloonist. Modelling himself on the famous French wire-walker Charles Blondin, L'Estrange performed a number of tightrope walks in the 1870s, culminating in three walks across Sydney's Middle Harbour in 1877. He remains the only tightrope performer ever to have walked across a part of Sydney Harbour. L'Estrange was an early balloonist, and attempted a series of flights in the early 1880s – one being successful, one ending in Australia's first emergency parachute descent, and the last culminating in a massive fireball causing property damage, personal injury and a human stampede. He tried {{to return to his}} original career of tightrope walking but, with new forms of entertainment, humiliating falls and other Blondin imitators, he found success elusive. Public benefits were held in his honour to recoup financial losses and he dabbled in setting up amusement rides but ultimately he faded from public attention and was last recorded to be living in Fitzroy, Victoria in 1894.|$|E

40|$|A lot of {{problems}} of transport engeneering are to face ambiguity, vagueness, subjectivity: • subjective valuations usually affect both a driver’s route choice and the mode of transportation among concurrent systems; • the valuation of {{the choice of the}} planoaltimetrical lay-out, of the level of service, of safety standards in relation to drivers’ perceptions and reactions, depend on the subjective judgment of road designers. Even when a stochastich and not deterministic approach is chosen the traditional methods of decision on above matters are based on binary logic, which, because of its inner nature, cannot effectively deal with vagueness, ambiguity and subjectivity. Fuzzy logic is by far more adherent to the peculiarities of these problems, and its recent development has permitted a lot of interesting achievements in transportation engeneering, both during the planning phase and during its operation regulating.

50|$|<b>Accidents</b> are <b>prone</b> {{to happen}} in any human undertaking, but {{accidents}} occurring within the healthcare system seem more salient and severe due to their {{profound effect on the}} lives of those involved, sometimes resulting in the death of a patient. In the healthcare system, {{there are a number of}} methods in which specific cases where accidents happened are reviewed by others who already know the outcome of the case. These methods include morbidity and mortality conferences, autopsies, case analysis, medical malpractice claims analysis, staff interviews, and even patient observation. Hindsight bias has been shown to cause difficulties in measuring errors in these cases. Many of these errors are considered preventable after the fact, clearly indicating the presence and importance of a hindsight bias in this field. There are two sides of debate in how these case reviews should be approached to best evaluate past cases: the error elimination strategy and the safety management strategy. The error elimination strategy aims to find the cause of errors, relying heavily on hindsight (therefore more subject to the hindsight bias). The safety management strategy relies less on hindsight (less subject to hindsight bias) and identifies possible constraints during the decision making process of that case. However, it is not immune to error.|$|R
40|$|Cyclists during bicycle traffic <b>accidents,</b> are <b>prone</b> to oblique impact {{which leads}} to {{rotational}} accelerations. Rotational acceleration is known to cause significant brain injuries, and should be minimized. Foam materials inside bicycle helmets undergo a combination of shear and compression loads during oblique impact. Therefore, developing an apparatus and a test method which can apply a combination of shear and compression loads to the foam {{at the same time}} is of great importance. This testing method has a broad application which is not only limited to the foams for bicycle helmet applications but has general relevance to sandwich core materials in structural composites. In this paper, the shear-compression behavior of different types of foams under different angles, particularly 15 ͦ, 45 ͦ and 60 ͦ is investigated and compared to the standard EPS foam used in bicycle helmets. Shear stresses in anisotropic PES foams under different angles in the combined shear-compression test were lower than for standard EPS, which is favourable because they lead to high rotational acceleration.

40|$|The {{established}} {{approach to}} safety management {{has failed to}} handle socio-technical systems that have become more complex. The main argument is this approach is based on assumptions that systems are protected against accidents by barriers (well-trained people, redundant mechanisms and safety devices, and procedures and safe systems of work). Complex systems, such as maintenance, are actually labour intensive; maintenance staff often works under pressure to finish tasks as rapidly as possible. They continuously adapt and make adjustments using available resources, time, knowledge, and competence to achieve success. Thus, they are <b>accidents</b> <b>prone.</b> Human factors inherent to maintenance accidents are most times difficult to identify. Research in this area in {{the oil and gas}} industry in maintenance management is limited in comparison to the aviation and nuclear sectors. Therefore, it has been suggested to overcome this lack by exploring the maintenance system and identifying appropriate methods and tools that lead a system to safety excellence. Resilience engineering (RE) approach has been found the suitable solution. Moreover, four system abilities (cornerstones of RE: ability to respond, to monitor, to anticipate, and to learn) have been identified to characterise the resilience of a system; if these abilities are known and increased, it will make the system As High Resilient As Possible (AHRAP). However, there is a need to bridge between RE theory and practice. Particularly, a tool that measures these abilities lacks in {{the oil and gas industry}}, specifically within the maintenance system. In doing so, a framework based on a Gap Analysis (GA) was outlined. A tool, the MAintenance System Resilience Assessment Tool- MASRAT, was developed to assess current system resilience and identify strategies for improvement to achieve safety excellence. The maintenance system of SONATRACH was explored by the analysis of the system documentation and processes, interviews with maintenance staff, questionnaires, field observations, storytelling, and functional analysis. MASRAT has been validated by means of congruency and principal components analysis, PCA (content validity), and Cronbach’s alpha (reliability). An expert panel testing was carried out to test its usability. The exploration of the system came up with a snapshot of daily activities as well as a better understanding of the maintenance system. The study identified the most significant human factors (resources, time pressure, and supervision/coordination) and their probable impact on plant safety. The elements of the system were found tightly coupled, hence the system complex. Stories describing the continuous adaptations of people to achieve assigned objectives were collected. On the other hand, MASRAT was validated. All items were rated above 0. 75 in congruency test. The results of PCA for the three selected factors confirmed the items may be clustered after extraction into four components which interpretation represents the four cornerstones of RE. The analysis showed MASRAT is reproducible. Cronbach’s alpha results were found higher than what is required (0. 7). MASRAT was found usable by maintenance expert panel. It was used to measure the maintenance department resilience. Strategies that may lead the system from current maturity level to excellence were identified. Eventually, recommendations were made to management to be implemented both at corporate and department levels. For the first time, the maintenance department resilience of petroleum assets was measured to fill in the gap between RE theory and practice. Besides, this can be of benefit to the petroleum industry by a better knowledge of the maintenance working environment and human factors impact on safety and by profiles determination and improvement strategies identification.

40|$|Bicycle {{accidents}} {{are not uncommon}} in Belgium, where cycling always hasbeen popular. Compared to {{the total number of}} road traffic injuries in Belgium in 2007, injured cyclists comprised 12 % of all road traffic victims and bicycle accidents ranked fourth on the top list of road traffic fatalities in Belgium (8. 2 % of all fatalities), after car accidents (51 %of all fatalities), motorcycle accidents (12. 74 % of all fatalities) andpedestrian accidents (9. 66 % of all fatalities). These numbers are high,compared to only 1. 7 % of all road traffic deaths in the United States in 2007 or 4. 6 % of all road traffic casualties in the United Kingdom in 2006. Victims of bicycle <b>accidents</b> are <b>prone</b> to head injury, which is the cause of death in 69  93 % of fatal bicycle accidents. Head injury is a real burden for society and requires not only optimal neurosurgical care,but also prevention to reduce this burden as much as possible. Therefore,many studies have been conducted to understand the mechanisms of injury, to develop tolerance criteria and to provide fundamental data for mathematical analogues such as the finite element model, in order to improvepreventive measures such as the bicycle helmet. In Belgium, the multidisciplinary Bicycle Helmet research group of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, with funding by the FWO-Levenslijn grant of the Levenslijn-Kinderfonds governed by the King Baudouin Foundation, undertakes research into craniocerebral trauma caused by bicycle accidents in order to improve existing bicycle helmets. This task force showed that existing bicycle helmets do not provide optimal protection underimpact conditions and can be optimised by means of {{a better understanding of the}} specific biomechanical processes underlying head injuries sustained in bicycle accidents. The presented research has been conducted within this framework, aimingat 1) the definition of biomechanical characteristics of craniocerebral trauma typically occurring in paediatric bicycle accidents, 2) the definition of the correct anatomical representation and material characteristics of a childs skull and 3) the definition of criteria to improve existing bicycle helmets. In a first phase of the current work we defined which craniocerebral traumata typically occurred in paediatric bicycle accidents in Flanders, Belgium, by analysing the bicycle related head trauma data in the PENTA (PaEdiatric Network around TraumA) registry, which was a newly created population-based data registry on trauma of Flemish children. This showed that the whole spectrum of possibly lethal head injury occurs in bicyclecrashes even without motor vehicle involvement. Most of these solitary bicycle crashes are low-energetic, therefore probably some of the sustained head injuries could be prevented by wearing a bicycle helmet. From this study we concluded that a good bicycle helmet should effectively protect against skull fracture and epidural haematoma, brain contusion and subdural haematoma. Subsequently, in a second phase of this work, we defined the biomechanical processes underlying these lesions, in order to improve current bicycle helmet designs. The first lesion we studied was frontal skull fracture upon impact. We studied criteria for its occurrence with particular interest in a possible energy criterion, by performing impact tests on specimen from 19 unembalmed post mortem human subjects. The results of this study suggest the existence of a failure energy level in the range of 22 - 24 J for dynamic frontal loading of an intact unembalmed head, being able to move with one degree of freedom. Secondly, we tried to unravel the biomechanical processes of acute subdural hematoma due to bridging vein rupture upon impact. Therefore we studied bridging vein rupture, trying to define criteria for its occurrence, related to the critical amount of force, displacement, stress and strain a bridging vein could resist. We performed tensile failure testing of 37 SSS-BV units from 9 unembalmed post mortem human subjects. This study  the first to provide biomechanical data on the SSS-BV unit - showed that the biomechanical response of the SSS-BV unit was stiffer than reported biomechanical behaviour of bridging vein, pointing towards the importance of this SSS-BV junction in the biomechanical characteristics of bridging vein rupture and ASDH. This study provided some support for the existence of a critical elongation/stretch criterion for the occurrence of ASDH due to BV rupture, with 5 mm elongation or 25 % stretch limit. Finally, we studied the frequently occurring fronto-temporal brain contusions at the inferior side of the temporal and frontal lobes and so-called contre-coup contusions on the anterior aspect of the frontal lobes and temporal poles of the brain. More specifically, we wanted to investigate the pathogenetic involvement of the skull base vibration upon impact. Therefore we determined the vibration response upon impact by performing an experimental modal analysis of four defleshed human skulls. Using finite element modal analysis, we showed that this vibration is not homogenous and the vibration of the frontal skull base and the temporal skull bone gives rise to the largest absolute bony displacement at these sites, independent of the site of impact. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that at the moment that the brain will show some translation and rotation anteriorly, becoming compressed against the fronto-temporal skull base, the fronto-temporal skull base will be vibrating. This could cause repetitive additional compression of the brain tissue at high frequency, leading to contusions. This hypothesis, however, has to be confirmedby performing the same tests on intact cadaver specimen, as we can assume that the modal behaviour of an intact cadaver head will be different from that of an empty skull, due to different head mass, presence of skin and intracranial contents and the connection to the body. The second goal of this dissertation was to aid in the development of a finite element model of a childs head by defining the correct anatomical representation of a childs skull, as well as the correct bone density and elasticity modulus of childrens skull bone. The correct anatomical representation and the bone density of a childs skull was investigated by developing a normative CT-based database, in which several 2 D and 3 D measurements, as well as bone thickness, bone density and fontanel dimensionswere examined. This study is the first to provide normative data on 2 D and 3 D measurements, skull bone thickness and skull bone density for children aged between 0 and 20 years. These data can help to tailor a finite element model of the skull to a childs skull of a certain age, what allows for the development and design of age-specific protective measures, such as a bicycle helmet for children. Besides the dimensional data, such a finite element should also use an age-specific skull bone elasticity modulus. These age-specific moduli should be measured in a non-destructive manner, allowing for testing in vivo and regardless of age. Therefore, we developed a testing protocol based on experimental modal analysis and finite element modal analysis. This pilot study showed that cranial bone elasticity modulus is indeed evolving with age and the developed protocol will be used in the future to derive the appropriate elasticity moduli. The final goal of this dissertation was to provide criteria for improving existing bicycle helmets. Therefore we applied our biomechanical findings with regard to the optimisation of current existing bicycle helmets. Basically, a helmet needs to protect against frontal skull fracture, bridging vein rupture and fronto-temporal contusions. To protect against frontal skull fracture, it should dissipate the impact energy in its structures and lower the eventual energy input into the frontal skull bone below the limit of 22 - 24 J. This means that the helmet liner should be able to dissipate roughly 75 J within its structure,when the helmeted head is struck frontally. In addition, it has already been shown (168) that lowering the temporal rim of current helmet designs with 2 - 3 cm is critical to better cover and protect the very vulnerable temple region of the head from fracture. To protect against bridging vein rupture, a helmet should protect against rotational acceleration of the headupon impact. The results of our bridging vein study can be used to optimize FEMs of the head, allowing exploring the rotational acceleration limits that will cause the bridging veins to be stretched to their shown limit of 25 % stretch. Within the bicycle helmet group, it was foundthat anisotropic helmet liners will lower the rotational acceleration of the head upon impact. As a result, the use of anisotropic materials inhelmets aiming to reduce rotational acceleration of the head, is protected by the K. U. Leuven bicycle helmet group patent Protective helmet with reference number BE 2005 / 000115. If our vibration hypothesis regarding fronto-temporal contusions will be validated in future research, we can advise that a bicycle helmet should not only block direct impact on the head to prevent fracture contusions or coup contusions, it should alsotry to alter or dampen the frequency load of the impact in order to avoid noxious resonant frequencies and prevent fronto-temporal contusions. Finally, we tried to define age-groups based on the normative database and give some directives to adapt a bicycle helmet to those age-groups, also taking into consideration the general development of the motor skillsof the child, as well as the changing body composition of the child. Based on this, we can extract three age-groups for which separate bicycle helmets should be designed: infants up to age of 5, children and young adolescents aged 6 - 13 y. o. and adolescents of 14 y. o. up to adults. Although this dissertation contains a lot of new and useful data on the biomechanics of head lesions that facilitates the development of better protective head gear, still, additional future research is needed in order to better understand the biomechanical processes underlying head lesions. In spite of this (and future) research, resulting in the developmentof the ultimate safe bicycle helmet, it will be useless if the helmet use rate remains very low in Flanders, as shown in the PENTA study (wearing rate of 3. 8 %). Therefore, the largest effort lies in convincing people to wear a bicycle helmet when cycling. In my personal opinion, the public debate about mandatory helmet legislation should be re-opened. It makes no sense funding research about the prevention of head injury in paediatric bicycle accidents, aiming at the development of an improved and age-specific helmet, without putting effort in convincing people to wear the helmet. This can be done by educational campaigns, but shouldbe accompanied by legislative initiatives. status: publishe...|$|R
