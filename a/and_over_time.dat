5|$|Ahimsa {{is one of}} the {{cardinal}} virtues and an important tenet of Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Ahimsa is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. Ahimsa has also been related to the notion that any violence has karmic consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>time</b> perfected the principles of Ahimsa, the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism. Most popularly, Mahatma Gandhi strongly believed in the principle of ahimsa.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe present {{longitudinal}} study (two waves), conducted on {{a population of}} 274 secondary-school teachers, expands on previous research on burnout and work engagement. Accordingly, the effect of organizational factors (obstacles, facilitators) as well as personal resources (self-efficacy) on burnout and engagement is tested longitudinally following the Social Cognitive Theory. More specifically, we test the loss and gain cycles, and reciprocal relationships concerning burnout, engagement, <b>and</b> self-efficacy <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> Four questions are addressed: (1) Are obstacles positively related to burnout <b>and</b> work self-efficacy <b>over</b> <b>time?</b> (2) Are facilitators positively related to engagement <b>and</b> self-efficacy <b>over</b> <b>time?</b> (3) Is work self-efficacy negatively related to burnout <b>and</b> obstacles <b>over</b> <b>time?</b> <b>and</b> (4) Is work self-efficacy positively related to engagement <b>and</b> facilitators <b>over</b> <b>time?</b> The results of a hard-copy survey carried out at two waves (8 months between the two times), which were computed on Structural Equation Modeling show that obstacles are positively related to burnout, {{which in turn is}} positively related to self-efficacy <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> Likewise, facilitators are positively related to engagement and self-efficacy, which in turn is positively related to facilitators <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> These findings suggest a positive gain cycle in which self-efficacy plays a central role...|$|R

Some camps were purpose-built, like Stalag II-D, but others could be former barracks, asylums or fortresses.|$|E

5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>time</b> acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure {{of the immune system}} allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11years, depending on the HIV subtype. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, vaginal fluids, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of Brygida Kürbis, it can be concluded that the 10-year marriage of Przemysł II and Ludgarda wasn't successful, <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>time</b> it became more obvious to everyone that the ducal couple was unable to have children, although this couldn't be completely certain, because Ludgarda in 1283 was at most only 23 years old. Nevertheless, is assumed that Przemysł II's growing aversion to his wife because of her infertility was well known by all. So when in mid-December 1283 Ludgarda died suddenly and separated (evidenced by her death in Gniezno, away from Przemysł II's court in Poznań), raised suspicion that the death of the duchess was unnatural. Nobody, however, had evidence of this. Contributing to rumors was that in the 13th century medical knowledge was negligible, and therefore often sudden death of a young person was interpreted as unnatural. In addition, the duke's rejection of a proper mourning to his wife, who was universally liked, increased the suspicions against Przemysł II.|$|E
5|$|Entertainment {{is a form}} of {{activity}} that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but {{is more likely to be}} one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>time</b> became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.|$|E

5|$|Increasing {{temperatures}} tend {{to increase}} evaporation {{which can lead}} to more precipitation. Precipitation generally increased over land north of 30°N from 1900 through 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s. Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have varied widely by region <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> Eastern portions of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia have become wetter. The Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia have become drier. There has been {{an increase in the number}} of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics. Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased salinity in lower latitudes (implying less precipitation and/or more evaporation). Over the contiguous United States, total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1percent since 1900, with the greatest increases within the East North Central climate region (11.6 percent per century) and the South (11.1percent). Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (−9.25percent).|$|E
5|$|Logan {{remained}} the Military Administrator and British representative to Samoa {{until the end}} of the war. At the time of its seizure, Samoa was politically stable and its economy was based on its plantations which were mainly German owned. Apart from replacing most of the key officials, who were Germans, with New Zealanders, he largely followed existing policies but over time made a series of misjudgements. The German-owned plantations were allowed to continue to operate but only to trade with neutral or Allied countries. By 1916, most of the larger plantations were seized and placed into receivership when it was discovered that they were still trading with German companies. This placed considerable financial stress on the economy. Not long into Logan's administration, an uprising of Chinese labourers, who complained about their rations, had to be suppressed. He continued to restrict their civil liberties <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>time</b> most were repatriated back to China. By not implementing quarantine procedures, he significantly mishandled the arrival of the influenza pandemic in November 1918, which resulted in over 7,500 deaths. This represented over 20% of Samoa's population at the time. In the meantime, neighbouring American Samoa was quarantined by its Governor, John Martin Poyer, and consequently had no influenza deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the cannon spans several hundred years. The cannon was invented in China {{as early as the}} 12th century and traces its {{development}} from the fire lance, the ancestor of cannons and firearms. They were among the earliest forms of gunpowder artillery, <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>time</b> replaced siege engines—among other forms of aging weaponry—on the battlefield. Their use was first documented in the Middle East in the 13th century, and the first cannon in Europe were probably used in Iberia, during the wars amongst Christians and Muslim kingdoms in Spain, in the 13th century. English cannon were first used during the Hundred Years' War, at the Battle of Crécy, in 1346. It was during this period, the Middle Ages, that cannon became standardized, and more effective in both the anti-infantry and siege roles. After the Middle Ages, most large cannon were abandoned, in favor of greater numbers of lighter, more maneuverable pieces. In addition, new technologies and tactics were developed, making most defenses obsolete; this led to the construction of star forts, specifically designed to withstand bombardment from artillery.|$|E
