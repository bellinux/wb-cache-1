5000|$|The primary {{difficulty}} in {{the calculation of}} damages {{is the question of}} causation. Remoteness will defeat a claim if it depends on very hypothetical possibilities. In McRae v. Commonwealth Disposals Commission (1951) 84 CLR 377 relying on rumours, the Commission sold to McRae the right to salvage an oil tanker thought to be marooned at the specified location. Unfortunately, the tanker did not exist. The Commission argued the contract was void because of a common mistake as to the existence of the subject matter, but the court noted that the Commission [...] "took no steps to verify what they were asserting and any 'mistake' that existed was induced by their own culpable conduct." [...] McRae wasted money searching for the non-existent wreck. His claim for the loss of profits expected from a successful salvage was dismissed as too speculative, but reliance damages were awarded for wasted expenses. Nevertheless, the courts have been prepared to speculate. In Chaplin v Hicks (1911) 2 KB 786 the defendant in breach of contract prevented the claimant from taking part in the final stage of a beauty contest where twelve of the final fifty (out of 6,000 original entrants) would be rewarded with places in a chorus line. The claimant was awarded damages for the loss of a chance, assessed at 25% of winning the competition. The court seemed to proceed on the claimant's statistical chance of winning (as if she were a lottery player) without any <b>actual</b> <b>assessment</b> of her physical attributes against any particular criteria of beauty.|$|E

While these games were going on, he had sent to Rome the remains of his deceased wife Helena, to be laid to rest in his villa near the city on the Via Nomentana, where also her sister Constantina, formerly the wife of Gallus, was buried." [...] In his assessment of Julian, Ammianus claims Julian practiced chastity and avoided sexual intercourse for the rest of his life. [...] "He was so conspicuous for inviolate chastity that after the loss of his wife it is well known that he never gave a thought to love: bearing in mind what we read in Plato, that Sophocles, the tragic poet, when he was asked, at a great age, whether he still had congress with women, said no, adding that he was glad that he had escaped from this passion as from some mad and cruel aster. Also, to give greater strength to this principle, Julianus often repeated the saying of the lyric poet Bacchylides, whom he delighted to read, who declares that as a skilful painter gives a face beauty, just so chastity gives charm to a life of high aims. This blemish in the mature strength of manhood he avoided with such care, that even his most confidential attendants never (as often happens) accused him even of a suspicion of any lustfulness." [...] Barnes notes that Ammianus offers much praise of both Julian and Eusebia. In contrast, there is no such praise for Helena, nor an <b>actual</b> <b>assessment</b> of her.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{relationship}} between customer focus (CF) competence and project performance were investigated {{on the basis}} of 1206 construction project teams. The hypotheses used were that a higher team CF <b>actual</b> <b>assessment</b> as well as a higher average team CF compliance (actual vs. desired CF level) increases the likelihood of achieving internal and overall budget goal, quality, as well as deadline goal. On the basis of simple and multiple regression models the conclusion is that only positive effects of the team average CF compliance on examined project goals are confirmed. On the other hand, the assumed positive effects of the team average CF <b>actual</b> <b>assessment</b> are rejected for the investigated project goals. Nonetheless, a suggestion for further research is that the inverse U-shaped relationship of the average team actual CF on the project performance should be examined. Along with the effects of CF (<b>actual</b> <b>assessment</b> and compliance) competence the multiple regression models reveal the effects of additional independent variables for the company (the revenue), the project (the duration, size, type, region, completion years) and the team (the average company and additional tenure, share of women, share of the employed {{at the end of the}} project, share of the assessed for CF, share of the final date contract and share of the technical versus business background) on achieving the project goals examined...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{agreement}} between patients' <b>actual</b> baseline <b>assessments</b> {{of pain and}} global health before treatment and retrospective assessments collected 2 weeks after treatment. METHODS: Data were collected in a prospective study of 200 rheumatology outpatients treated with a local corticosteroid injection. At baseline and 2 -week follow-up, localized pain and global health were assessed on 100 mm visual analogue scales. The follow-up questionnaire was extended with a retrospective assessment of pain and global health before treatment. RESULTS: At follow-up patients slightly overestimated the severity of pain and global health before treatment. <b>Actual</b> and retrospective <b>assessments</b> were adequately correlated (pain: r(r(r(s) = 0. 73; global health: r(s) = 0. 67). Bland-Altman analysis showed that both pain and global health were characterized by high intra-individual variation between <b>actual</b> and retrospective <b>assessments,</b> with the 95 % limits of agreement (- 37. 3 to 32. 3 mm for pain and - 49. 7 to 37. 8 mm for global health) far exceeding proposed values for minimal clinically important differences. CONCLUSION: Over a 2 -week interval, patients' retrospective assessments of baseline pain and global health are fairly accurate and adequately correlated with actual baseline scores. At the group level, retrospective assessments can provide acceptable data on baseline pain and global health. The wide variability between <b>actual</b> and retrospective <b>assessments,</b> however, indicates that even over short time intervals there is poor individual agreement between the two methods...|$|R

In recent years, Pressure-State-Response (P-S-R) frameworks have been central to conceptualizing marine ecosystem issues and then translating those to stakeholders, environmental managers and researchers. Society {{is concerned about the}} risks to the natural and human system posed by those Pressures (thus needing risk assessment) and then needs to act to minimize or compensate those risks (as risk management). This research relates this to the DPSIR (Drivers-Pressure-State(change) -Impact-Response) hierarchical framework using standardized terminology/definitions and lists of impacting Activities and Pressures affecting ecosystem components, incorporating the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) legal decision components. This uses the example of fishing activity and the pressure of abrasion from trawling on the seabed and its effects on particular ecosystem components. The mechanisms of Pressure acting on State changes are highlighted here as an additional refinement to DPSIR. The approach moves from conceptual models to <b>actual</b> <b>assessments</b> including: assessment methodologies (interactive matrices, ecosystem modeling, Bayesian Belief Networks, Bow-tie approach, some assessment tools) data availability, confidence, scaling, cumulative effects and multiple simultaneous Pressures, which more often occur in multi-use and multi-user areas.
