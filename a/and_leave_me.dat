500|$|After this, Bond's next {{role was}} Phœbe Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard (1888–89). [...] Of this role, Bond wrote, [...] "My {{share in the}} most {{beautiful}} of all the Gilbert and Sullivan operas was delightfully easy and natural. [...] When Gilbert {{gave it to me}} at the first reading he said, 'Here you are, Jessie, you needn't act this, it's you.'" [...] Gilbert was even more nervous than usual on the first night of Yeomen and came backstage to give his best wishes to the cast. [...] Bond wrote, [...] "I am afraid he made himself a perfect nuisance behind the scenes, and did his best, poor fellow, to upset us all. These first nights were very hard on me... and nearly always my understudy was called upon to officiate on the second night of a play, while I lay exhausted in my bed. [...] , the curtain rises on Phœbe alone at her spinning wheel, and Gilbert kept fussing about... until I was almost as demented as he was. [...] At last I turned on him savagely. [...] 'For Heaven's sake, Mr. Gilbert, go away <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> alone, or I shan't be able to sing a note!' He gave me a final frenzied hug, and vanished." ...|$|E
2500|$|Van Peebles {{turned down}} a large money offer from a record label that wanted him to perform his lyrics over samples of older recordings. Van Peebles said, [...] "That's not what I do! The {{structures}} of my songs are more complicated and subtle than jingles or nursery rhymes, with music which helps carry the story along. The words aren't just shouted over some loop which repeats itself." [...] Van Peebles later received an offer from Capitol Records and told the label [...] "Here's the deal: Send money, <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> alone. I'll send the tape. That's it. Just go away, and let the doorknob hit you where the good Lord split you." [...] Capitol gave Van Peebles complete artistic control over the recording as a result, and he was satisfied with the business deal, {{as well as the}} finished album.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first act}} was rather long and {{contained}} an unusual number of sentimental pieces. [...] As opening night approached, Gilbert became increasingly apprehensive. [...] Would the audience accept this serious, sentimental tone {{from one of}} the duo's [...] "comic" [...] operas? [...] Gilbert and Sullivan cut two songs from Act I and part of the Act I finale, partly to decrease the number of sentimental pieces near the beginning of the opera. [...] Gilbert, always nervous himself on opening nights, came backstage before the performance on opening night to [...] "have a word" [...] with some of the actors, inadvertently conveying his worries to the cast and making them even more nervous. [...] Jessie Bond, who was to open the show with a solo song alone on stage, finally said to him, [...] "For Heaven's sake, Mr. Gilbert, go away <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> alone, or I shan't be able to sing a note!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{getting out}} of here--making tracks <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>me</b> alone. Every man has his price, and I'm trapped--I'm willing to pay anything--I'll--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Doctor Winchester went away, taking, with a courteous forethought, Mr. Corbeck with him, <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>me</b> behind. When {{the others}} had gone Mr. Trelawny said: ...|$|R
6000|$|Then, {{in spite}} of all I could do to keep him, he went, muttering: [...] "Strange! Exceeding strange!" [...] <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>me</b> quite unfit for prayer.|$|R
2500|$|Keselowski {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} first win {{of the season in}} front of 102,000 people who attended the race. Keselowski also earned $186,770 in race winnings. Afterward, he said, [...] "This car here, this brand-new car that Penske Racing built -- everybody back at the shop did a phenomenal job. The last few races have been really good, and I knew we had a shot at winning one if we closed the deal. Matt didn't make it easy." [...] Kenseth, who finished second, said, [...] "I was thinking I could run outside of him , but he would roll through there so fast you could never get a run on him. I think he liked the bottom of [...] 1 and 2, but I could never get around on the bottom of [...] 1 and 2, so that {{was the right thing to}} do, to start on the top <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> on the bottom -- for him." ...|$|E
60|$|Wood. Go {{you into}} your bed-chamber, <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> to my fortune.|$|E
60|$|And they go away <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> {{in peace}} {{to the end of}} their division.|$|E
60|$|Lumley got up {{and left}} me--making a {{straight}} line for Fort Wichikagan, as we had named our outpost, <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>me</b> in a dreamy state of mind beside the spring.|$|R
6000|$|At this Mrs. Pallant got up; {{she stood}} there looking down at me. [...] "You make my reparation--my expiation--difficult!" [...] <b>And</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>me</b> still more {{astonished}} she moved along the terrace.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have watched}} you, Heart of mine," [...] I cried, [...] "So often going astray <b>And</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>me,</b> that I have pursued, [...] Feeling such truancy [...] Ought not to be." ...|$|R
60|$|Adr. Away, my friends, since fate has so allotted; Begone, <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> to the villain's mercy.|$|E
60|$|ELLIE. Quite, quite sure. Now {{you must}} go away <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> to talk to Mrs Hushabye.|$|E
60|$|MRS. GWYN. [Turning {{away from}} her.] Life is n't fair. Peachey, go in <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> alone.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. But it was nothing; it was {{the outline}} of the--tall clock and the chair behind. Would you mind going down, <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>me</b> to go into my room for a moment?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] replied Jessie, with a half-disappointed look; [...] "then I suppose you'll {{be going}} off again on your long {{journeys}} into the interior, <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>me</b> to pine here in solitude?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I suppose so, Tom. You will {{be going}} off <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>me,</b> {{in a month or}} two,' he said, rather discontentedly. 'Though why you shouldn't, I don't know,' he added, in a gayer voice.|$|R
60|$|Alon. Sir, I shall take it very unkindly if you satisfy any other, <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> in this perplexity.|$|E
60|$|No. You {{will wait}} until Linda comes back. Besides, you can't {{run away from}} this <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> alone to face it.|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. Not of that kind, anyhow. And now run along, Minnie, <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> {{to my own}} base devices. I'm busy.|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] she timidly answered, [...] "to talk quite practically, wouldn't it be {{best not}} to marry till after all that?--Though I can't bear the thought o' your going away <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>me</b> here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Heavens, Mr. Haggarty!' says she, 'how you seize me with surprise! Castlereagh, my dear nephew, had you {{not better}} <b>leave</b> us?' <b>and</b> away he went, {{lighting}} a cigar, <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>me</b> {{still on the}} floor.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it, Larkins?" [...] said I. Larkins' other master {{had taken}} his leave some time before, having {{business}} which called him away, <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>me</b> with the honest Colonel, quite happy with his talk and cigar.|$|R
60|$|GILBEY. So {{long as you}} dont flounce out <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> {{alone with}} her. [He rises and plants himself on the hearth-rug].|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! That {{must have}} been a mad-house. I shan't trouble you to take me there yet. Get me my breakfast, please, <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> alone.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Grandfather is {{very ill}} to-night," [...] he whispered. [...] "You had better all {{go into the}} bedroom, <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> alone to watch by him." ...|$|E
60|$|Then he rose, bowed gravely <b>and</b> departed, <b>leaving</b> <b>me</b> full of reflections.|$|R
6000|$|Now then, will Harper or Appleton, or Putnam give me $200,000 {{for those}} debts and my two-thirds {{interest}} in the firm? (The firm of course taking the Mount Morris and all such obligations off my hands <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>me</b> clear of all responsibility.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why then, sir, {{you have}} a {{singular}} taste, that's all," [...] says the old gentleman, turning on his heel <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> I could perfectly understand his vexation at my {{not being able to}} see the world as he viewed it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have done}} enough, perhaps, to endanger yourself," [...] said Lord Glenvarloch. [...] "I pray {{you to be}} gone, <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> to my fate." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, try it, then," [...] she said, resignedly. [...] "If Ludovic gets mad <b>and</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>me,</b> I'll {{be worse}} off than ever. But nothing venture, nothing win. And there is a {{fighting}} chance, I suppose. Besides, I must admit I'm tired of his dilly-dallying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But, listen,' said Tom Loker, getting excited, 'there {{are people}} who are {{watching}} the boats for us. I don't care if I tell now. I hope they will get away, just to spite the others for going <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>me</b> as they did--the mean puppies, the--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose so, Tom, and you'll {{be going}} off <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>me,</b> {{in a month}} or so," [...] he added, rather discontentedly. [...] "Though why you shouldn't, no mortal knows," [...] he said, in a gayer tone; and, getting up, he began to walk the floor.|$|R
