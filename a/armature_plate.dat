The first modern direct-pull electromagnetic lock was designed by Sumner [...] "Irving" [...] Saphirstein in 1969.|$|E
50|$|An {{improved}} 'shear' electromagnetic lock was patented on May 2, 1989, by Arthur, Richard and David Geringer of Security Door Controls, {{an access}} control hardware manufacturing firm. The device outlined in their designs {{was the same}} in principle as the modern magnetic lock consisting of an electromagnet and an <b>armature</b> <b>plate.</b> The patent did not make any reference to the manufacturing methods of the electromagnet and detailed several variations on the design, including one that used a spring-loaded <b>armature</b> <b>plate</b> to bring the <b>armature</b> <b>plate</b> closer to the electromagnet. The patent expired on May 2, 2009.|$|E

[...] "Out of an almost infinite kindness {{for young men}} who were struggling, Mr. Edison received me {{in the midst of}} some laboratory work he was doing in the coating of laminated <b>armature</b> <b>plates.</b> Seeming to be interested in the questions I asked him, he drew me out in turn, and spent an hour personally showing me over his lamp works[...][...] At the end of the visit, he offered me a job." [...] Gano Dunn [...] Dunn declined Edison's job offer and continued perusing his college degree.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the analysis, {{planning}} and development of an application for company Pipistrel, which makes ultra-light planes. The application is to simplify, speed up and consequently reduce the expenses of the production process. It however aims to improve only {{the part of the}} production process where the aircraft instruments (henceforth instruments) are being placed on <b>armature</b> <b>plates</b> (henceforth plates). This part of the production process was done manually so far and no application was used, so the choice of a program language and development environment was entirely mine. Considering the offer of the current technology and application development environment, I opted for a widely used development tool Microsoft Visual Studio 2008. I also had several programming languages to choose form, and decided to use C#, because it is often used today and I already worked with it in the past. For saving data I chose the Microsoft Access database. The introductory part of the thesis includes a short presentation of the company I cooperated with and a description of our approach to the problem. I described the analysis and the planning of the application system. This includes business processes, diagrams illustrating the use with descriptions of individual examples of use, database planning and user interface planning. Chapter 4 shows the results of my work - the application forms and the problems I came across during the development of the application. The final part of the thesis features my conclusions and a description of a possible further development of the application and descriptions of specific instruments. ...|$|R
5000|$|An {{electromagnetic}} lock, magnetic lock, or maglock is a {{locking device}} {{that consists of}} an electromagnet and an <b>armature</b> <b>plate.</b> There are two main types of electric locking devices. Locking devices can be either [...] "fail safe" [...] or [...] "fail secure". A fail-secure locking device remains locked when power is lost. Fail-safe locking devices are unlocked when de-energized. Direct pull electromagnetic locks are inherently fail-safe. Typically the electromagnet portion of the lock {{is attached to the}} door frame and a mating <b>armature</b> <b>plate</b> is attached to the door. The two components are in contact when the door is closed. When the electromagnet is energized, a current passing through the electromagnet creates a magnetic flux that causes the <b>armature</b> <b>plate</b> to attract to the electromagnet, creating a locking action. Because the mating area of the electromagnet and armature is relatively large, the force created by the magnetic flux is strong enough to keep the door locked even under stress.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} {{behind an}} electromagnetic lock {{is the use}} of electromagnetism to lock a door when energized. The holding force should be collinear with the load, and the lock and <b>armature</b> <b>plate</b> should be face-to-face to achieve optimal operation.|$|E
50|$|Installation is straightforward. With in-swinging applications, the {{electromagnet}} {{is typically}} {{installed in the}} opening corner of {{the door at the}} door's header. Maglocks can also be installed vertically in the door opening when they are furnished with a full length housing. With this configuration the armature is through-bolted through the door and oriented to mate with the face of the electromagnet. The <b>armature</b> <b>plate</b> and electromagnet must touch in order to provide locking holding force.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the thermal regime for a double sided linear induction motor with ring windings and sectioned <b>plate</b> <b>armature</b> which is sectioned with vertical cutting-up. The sectioned armature is done {{in order to reduce the}} eddy currents into the plate, which are not useful for the traction force of the linear motor. The motor can operate in an oscillating drive system with fast response and low distance movement or for small and medium movement application. For different forces developed by the motor, a thermal modeling is realized for the linear induction motor and it is compared with experimental data regarding the thermal aspects. The theoretical characteristics of the motor heating overlap the experimental characteristics and confirm the validity of the thermal model...|$|R
