40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} the possible substitution between digital networks and <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> in the management of the B-to-C relationship. Rather than considering the persistence of commercial intermediation as a transition friction, that paper claims that efficiency arguments explain why <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> exist {{and will continue to be}} involved in the exchanges despite the spread of digital technologies (often supposed to support frictionless and disintermediated markets). <b>Commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> provide producers and consumers with a set of information, logistic, securization and insurance (and liquidity) services. By bundling these services and by dedicating assets and learning capabilities to their production, <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> enable to economize on transaction costs. Digital network per se cannot enables transacting parties to benefit from such efficient providers of intermediation services. Rather than establishing direct relationships among producers and consumers, the Internet will support a reorganization of existing intermediation chains, because traditional intermediaries will reinforce their ability to provide their services using ICTs.

40|$|One {{aspect of}} the old ideological {{heritage}} that Soviet proponents of transition to a market system must overcome is the common association of trade or commercial activity with "speculation. " The latter term, in the Soviet public mind, is commonly identified with the activities of <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> or middlemen. The opening article in our current issue, "The Market: Trade? Speculation?" by V. Mashits and Ia. Chernysheva, illustrates how some of the current economic literature is attempting to counter this view. The authors elaborate the argument that in a market economy the activities of <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> (>i>torgovo-posrednicheskaia deiatel'nost'>/i>) provide indispensable signals in guiding the production and marketing decisions of enterprises. Speculation, for Mashits and Chernysheva, or at least speculation in its "wild" forms, is a problem associated not with the market as such but with "undeveloped, unorganized, monopolized markets. " Thus every step by Soviet society toward "modern market structures" would represent movement away from "wild" forms of speculation. Soviet society suffers not from the activity of middlemen but from the fact that, having been driven underground, such activity becomes "a game without rules. " The significance of this defense of <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> is heightened by its appearance in >i>Kommunist>/i>, a principal theoretical organ of the party's Central Committee. ...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, the Chinese {{government}} replaced strict control over outmigration with measures of ‘infrastructural governance’. Instead of dictating who can and who cannot leave, the state manages migration by influencing the sociotechnical conditions of mobility, for instance by defining what responsibilities <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> should shoulder and what training a migrant should receive before departure. This article unpacks infrastructural governance {{by examining the}} working of ‘base’, or jidi in Chinese. A base is a tight cluster {{of public and private}} institutions in a labour source place, designated by the government as an important player in the recruitment of migrant workers. The base manages migration by conditioning the activities that lead to migration, such as how people choose destinations, make payments, and deal with uncertainties in preparing for migration. The base also works on migrants’ relations with family members, village cadres and fellow migrants in order to shape their mobilities. The ethnographic research on the base shows that, infrastructural governance regulates migration effectively, but makes migration more complicated and more costly for the migrants.

As the revenues from direct sale of recordings to consumers has declined {{and the importance of}} rights revenue has increased, older risks and uncertainties about musicians and their listeners have been reconfigured, compounded by the cultural consequences of digitalisation, and the waves of data produced via digitalisation.

In both regions, most producers were small and medium sized (100 % in Puno and 91. 6 % in Junin). The supply chains in Puno and Junin comprised 24 and 31 channels, respectively. It was found that numerous collectors, formal and informal processors, and exporters mainly linked with organized producers participated in these supply chains and this made trade efficient and coordinated. In contrast, trade among individual producers in the domestic markets through agents in the supply chain was highly disjointed, tending toward high centralization and without added value.

40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} a {{study of}} agrarian change in one highland, ex-hacienda locality in the Cochabamba region of Bolivia and documents a process of agricultural intensification and crop specialisation amongst small producers. The thesis demonstrates that. Since the Agrarian Reform, a process of commoditization has transformed the locality, leading to its incorporation into the regional economy as a major producer of potatoes. It examines {{the role played by}} a dynamic sector of truck operators and <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> in stimulating this process. The thesis reconstructs the emergence of the hacienda, and the forms of production which co-existed on the estate. It documents the implementation of the Agrarian Reform and the distribution of land titles to ex-labour-rent tenants which consolidated the pattern of usufruct holdings and consequently formalised inequality between households. The contemporary situation is characterised by an intensive farming system which places considerable demands upon local environmental resources. The thesis conducts a detailed analysis of the existing pattern of land ownership, labour relationships and the distribution of other productive resources, to demonstrate that access to the means of production, control over the production process and disposal of the fruits of labour are highly uneven between households. However, inequality in the control over agricultural operations, besides the movement of labour from poor to rich households, do not by themselves provide sufficient evidence of differentiation between units. The thesis examines other dimensions which {{play a vital role in}} determining the social and economic trajectory of households. These include the role played by non-agricultural economic activities and the organisational structure of households. The thesis demonstrates the value of moving beyond the boundaries that conventionally define the analysis of household production, in order to examine dynamics within the domestic unit.

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{two important}} features of many copyright fair use cases: transformative use and commercial intermediation. While {{the issue of}} transformative use has arisen in many fair use cases, {{there is a lack}} of consistency and clear guidance on the meaning of “transformativeness” and how the degree of transformativeness is to be assessed. Additionally, in analyzing commercial use, courts have largely failed to appreciate the distinctive role played by “commercial intermediaries” in facilitating socially beneficial uses of copyrighted works. This Article advances economically grounded proposals for improving the way in which courts analyze transformative use and commercial intermediation. First, courts should focus on the economic effects of transformation instead of employing a purely conceptual analysis. In particular, courts should ascertain any complementary or substitutive effects as well as the cost and innovative-efficiency implications of the use: the more transformative the use, the more it tends to minimize market harm to the copyright owner and maximize social benefits such as transaction-cost economies and follow-on innovation. Second, courts should view <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> favorably insofar as they facilitate educational or other beneficial fair uses of copyrighted works through cost-efficient production or substantial innovative investments. In other words, courts should view the commercial use in context and recognize that commercial uses may nonetheless produce social benefits that substantially outweigh any harm caused to copyright owners. This Article uses the 2013 Google Books decision as a primary case study, supplemented by related cases from the United States and abroad, to illustrate these arguments, concluding that the court’s decision to uphold Google’s fair use defense for Google Books is well-supported by the complementary relationship between Google Books and copyrighted books, Google’s substantial investments in promoting productive uses of books through Google Books, and transaction-cost and innovative-incentive considerations. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

Recent evaluation criteria, like the CC and the ISO-ECITS now contain components assigned to privacy. This is a step towards enhanced privacy protection, especially for non-experts. We examined the suitability and use of these components and the criteria as a whole by specifying a number of Protection Profiles (PPs) for remailer mix networks, as mix networks aim at user anonymity and unobservable message transfer. This contribution reports on the PPs and the experiences gained. It also introduces proposals for improving the criteria that were derived from this work. 1. IT security certification and criteria The complexity of today’s information technology (IT) {{makes it impossible to}} evaluate its security by simple “examination”. Moreover, for most users it is hardly possible to conduct more detailed checks, which are necessary for a qualified evaluation, as they cannot afford the expenditure this would entail. Thus, more and more users are faced with the problem of knowing very little about the technique they use for important transactions (e. g. processing sensitive patient data, signing documents, or making payments). One way to enable confidence in IT is to evaluate and certify products and systems by neutral and competent institutions on the basis of published IT security evaluation criteria. Related certification schemes exist since the mid 80 's, for example, in the USA, the UK, and Germany. There are regional differences between the schemes, but typically (cf. Figure 1) a sponsor asks (and pays) for an evaluation that is conducted by an <b>accredited</b> (<b>commercial</b> or governmental) IT Security Evaluation Facility (ITSEF) and monitored and certified by a (governmental or commercial) Certification Body (CB).

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{seeks to}} develop an {{alternative}} conceptual framework through which to understand international finance. It then applies this framework {{to the case of}} China’s recent official foreign exchange accumulation. One view of international financial relations suggests an agenda of state-to-state financial relations, especially in terms of financial power relations between nations (Andrews et. al. 2006). Another view suggests that finance, while being globally mobile, expresses clear national characteristics such that the aggregation of financial transactions will tell a coherent national story, such as a story of mercantile policy rooted in national trade and payments imbalances (Goldstein 2004). This thesis develops an explanatory critique of these approaches, and suggests an alternative theoretical approach to understanding international financial relations. It does this by augmenting a theory of international financial intermediation — understood as a socially determined, value-chain driven process of cross-border and crosscurrency financial transformation by and through international financial intermediary institutions(Scholtens and Van Wensveen 2003) — with a strategic relational approach to state policy. This framework is then applied with a view to understanding the development of a process of official foreign exchange accumulation by China’s monetary authorities. It seeks to account for why Chinese official reserve accumulation has predominately taken the form of US dollar assets, and to explain recent pressures and responses by China’s authorities to their official US dollar ‘liquidity dilemma’. This thesis argues that the recent pattern and level of China’s foreign exchange accumulation is primarily a secondary by-product of other foreign exchange, monetary and financial risk-mitigation objectives which operate {{in the context of a}} rising structural surplus and rising inflows of foreign exchange liquidity. Finally, despite the popular view, this pattern of recent official reserve accumulation has been a relatively durable two-way international financial intermediary relationship. China’s authorities will continue to accumulate US government debt securities unless they decide to ‘float’ the exchange rate. Even then, while the cross-border intermediaries would change — from official to <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> — the pattern of international asset accumulation is likely to continue...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} charts {{the social}} interactions, work experiences, and routes traveled by Asian workers {{within and between}} the colonial Philippines and Mexico between 1571 and 1720. Residents of early colonial Mexico called these workers chinos. Most free chinos were Filipinos, but enslaved chinos had origins all over Asia. Chinos crossed the Pacific on the Manila galleons, which sailed between the Philippines and Mexico. These ships facilitated the exchange of American products, mostly silver, for Asian products, primarily textiles. This study explores the social and spatial mobility of chinos to show how trade between and within the Americas and Asia opened {{a new chapter in}} the social history of the early modern world. This project expands the study of Latin American history in three ways. First, it analyzes the ways in which chinos, especially Filipinos, created and sustained colonial Mexico as part of a Pacific world, advancing scholarship that already celebrates Mexico as part of an Atlantic world. Next, this work develops the study of economic history by comparing the ways that chinos shaped and connected different regions of colonial Mexico by employing Southeast Asian labor organization and technology. Thirdly, this dissertation refines studies of ethnicity by considering the ways that chinos, especially free laborers, represented themselves as members of a new corporate group in colonial Mexico, and appropriated the ethnic category of "indio," originally established for indigenous people in the Americas. They used these categories to claim resources from the colonial state, to form social networks, and to create bases for collective action. This work advances the field of early modern global and world history. It analyzes the Philippines and Pacific New Spain as arenas of cross-cultural interaction, labor, migration, and production in their own right, rather than as mere <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> mediating between East Asia and the Americas. Finally, this work considers the ways that the long history of interactions between Island Southeast Asia and the rest of Asia shaped the mobility of chinos, while also situating their trans-Pacific interactions within the institutions of the global tributary empire of the Spanish Habsburgs...|$|R
40|$|Over recent decades, {{developments}} in network governance have seen governments {{around the world}} cede considerable authority and responsibility to <b>commercial</b> migration <b>intermediaries</b> for recruiting and managing temporary migrant labour.

40|$|The {{revocation}} of {{an agent}} frequently {{raises the question}} of the legal basis for the right to indemnity by agent so revoked. The existence of such a right as well as the determination of the amount of the indemnity depend {{on the nature of the}} relationship between the agent and his client. In the case of an independent agent, this relationship is of a special nature. His function differs from that of a servant and that of an independent trader, who are both currently called agents. The indépendant agent deals with third parties for a client, but does not himself supply the goods and services in which he trades. The indépendant agent, to whom is recognized the status of <b>commercial</b> <b>intermediary,</b> has a function which is characterized by his own obligational contents. He brings to the execution of his work the duties of a professional. He is subject to an obligation of diligence and, because of his professional status, incurs a certain liability towards the third party he deals with. The qualification of mandate, often given to his contract, cannot take into account the extensive obligations imposed on the agent, particularly the fact that he makes a profession of his agency and that he has a special interest in the success of the affair he négociâtes. The reference to rules of a civil nature in matters that relate to business creates some confusion.
