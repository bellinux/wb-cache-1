30|$|By Lemma  2.9, {{in order}} to prove the {{existence}} of <b>a</b> unique <b>strictly</b> positive almost periodic solution of system (1.3), we only need to prove that each hull equation of system (1.3) has <b>a</b> unique <b>strictly</b> positive solution.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new family of affine metrics on <b>a</b> locally <b>strictly</b> convex surface $M$ in affine 4 -space. Then, we define the symmetric and antisymmetric equiaffine planes associated with each metric. We show that if $M$ is immersed in <b>a</b> locally <b>strictly</b> convex hyperquadric, then the symmetric and the antisymmetric planes coincide and contain the affine normal to the hyperquadric. In particular, any surface immersed in <b>a</b> locally <b>strictly</b> convex hyperquadric is affine semiumbilical {{with respect to the}} symmetric or antisymmetric equiaffine planes...|$|R

5|$|Although in {{the past}} {{cardinal}} electors could be accompanied by attendants ("conclavists"), now only a nurse may accompany a cardinal who for reasons of ill-health, as confirmed by the Congregation of Cardinals, needs such assistance. The Secretary of the College of Cardinals, the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations, two Masters of Ceremonies, two officers of the Papal Sacristy and an ecclesiastic assisting the Dean of the College of Cardinals are also admitted to the conclave. Priests are available to hear confessions in different languages; two doctors are also admitted. Finally, <b>a</b> <b>strictly</b> limited number of servant staff are permitted for housekeeping and the preparing and serving of meals.|$|E
5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon is not <b>a</b> <b>strictly</b> massless particle, {{it would not}} move at the exact speed of light, c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, {{it would still be}} the speed of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), but it would not be the speed of photons.|$|E

5|$|Details on the Mauretanian {{events of}} 39–44 are unclear. Cassius Dio wrote an entire chapter on the {{annexation}} of Mauretania by Caligula, {{but it is}} now lost. Caligula's move seemingly had <b>a</b> <b>strictly</b> personal political motive – fear and jealousy of his cousin Ptolemy – and thus the expansion {{may not have been}} prompted by pressing military or economic needs. However, the rebellion of Tacfarinas had shown how exposed Africa Proconsularis was to its west and how the Mauretanian client kings were unable to provide protection to the province, and it is thus possible that Caligula's expansion was a prudent response to potential future threats.|$|E
5|$|From 1955 to 1994, The King's College, <b>a</b> <b>strictly</b> Fundamentalist coeducational {{liberal arts}} college, {{relocated}} to the Briarcliff Lodge property. The school used the lodge building and built dormitories and academic buildings. During that time, in 1985, the Lodge and the Briarcliff library were among 60 sites given historical markers by Westchester County Tricentennial Commission. The New York State Board of Regents closed {{the school in}} 1994 due to financial difficulties and a deficiency of qualified faculty. After it closed, the nonprofit Tara Circle planned to build an Irish-American cultural, education, and athletic center, which {{was approved by the}} village in November 1994. The site was again purchased in 1996 by Blue Lake Properties.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the Air Force was {{tasked with}} {{gathering}} intelligence, air reconnaissance, and air transport. Support of ground troops, both doctrinally {{and as a}} practical matter, became marginal. These missions were strongly influenced by a shrinking capability, since its combat aircraft could operate by daylight only, its anti-aircraft artillery was obsolete, and the FLORIDA radar system had reached the limits of operational effectiveness. The retirement of the Hawker Hunters in 1994ended its ground support capability, and a cut of one-third from the defence budget meant that plans for a second purchase of F/A-18s and supporting air-to-ground weapons (the reason the multi-capable Hornet was selected) had to be canceled, leaving both it and the F-5s in <b>a</b> <b>strictly</b> air-to-air role.|$|E

5|$|Monastic reform {{became an}} {{important}} issue during the 11th century, as elites began to worry that monks were not adhering to the rules binding them to <b>a</b> <b>strictly</b> religious life. Cluny Abbey, founded in the Mâcon region of France in 909, was established {{as part of the}} Cluniac Reforms, a larger movement of monastic reform in response to this fear. Cluny quickly established a reputation for austerity and rigour. It sought to maintain a high quality of spiritual life by placing itself under the protection of the papacy and by electing its own abbot without interference from laymen, thus maintaining economic and political independence from local lords.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of January 30, as Goebel and two friends walked toward the capitol building, a shot rang out, and Goebel fell wounded.
