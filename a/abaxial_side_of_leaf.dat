A detailed anatomical structure of vegetative organs: leaf, petiole, rhizome and root {{of a highly}} medicinal plant Bergenia ciliata were described for the first time. Cells in all parts were rich in starch grains and some cells contain calcium oxalate crystals. Some important anatomical features were: a hood like structure found in its lower portion of petiole; petiole supplied with numerous conjoint, collateral and open vascular bundles with poorly differentiated bundle sheath; leaves amphistomatic; ten to fifteen conjoint, collateral and open vascular bundles found in mid vein of leaf. Globular trichomes were present in <b>abaxial</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>leaf</b> and petiole; cork of rhizome divided into two zones; cork cambium multilayered; secondary growth evident in rhizome and root; activity of interfascicular cambium in rhizome was lacking. Endodermis and pericycle only found in root was crushed during secondary growth; polyarch xylem and phloem in root; vessels short and narrow with simple perforation plates. There was no comprehensible difference in size of central and lateral vascular bundles of leaf and petiole as in some other Saxifragaceae. Well developed bundle sheath which was the characteristic feature of many Saxifragaceae was feebly distinguished in the leaf and petiole of B. ciliata. The globular trichomes found in leaf and petiole of B. ciliata is probably a new feature for Saxifragaceae...|$|E
40|$|Heavy {{metals and}} other toxic {{elements}} in the environment, mainly located in soil and groundwater, {{have a significant effect}} on plant and its productivity that has a huge attention in recent years. Accumulation of heavy metals in soil cause toxicity to plants, and contaminate the food chain. The industrial areas, as well as developing countries have been contaminated with high concentration of heavy metals. Main sources of contamination are mining and other industrial processes, as well as military and or lanfills, sludge dumps or waste disposal sites. The heavy metals are very dangerous to environment and pose serious danger to public health by entering throught the food chain or into drinking water. Phytoextraction is one way how to remove the contaminants from soil by plants. Phytoextraction of heavy metals is a technology that has been studied for several years. It is more ecological and cheaper way how to clean our environment. Several plant species are known becauce they hyperaccumulate a high contents of metals from the soil. The accumulators are mainly herbaceous species, crops and nowadays angiosperm trees with a high growth such as poplars or willows. We have focused on the determination of some morphological (lenght and weight of roots and biomass) and physiological (contents of dry mass and number of lief stomata) characteristics and the determination of the bioaccumulation factor and the translocation factor of cadmium by spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Imprints of leaves were evaluated using an optical microscope Axiostar Plus, Carl Zeiss, lens CP Achromat 40 x/ 0. 65, eyepiece PI 10 x / 18, Canon Utilities Software Zoom Browser EX 4. 6 and hardware Acer Travel Mate 4600, Canon Power Shot A 95. The density of stomata was evaluated on an area of 1 mm 2. Samples of the dried plants (leaves and roots) were mineralized by acid digestion using microwave digestion device MARS X - press 5. The end of determination to obtain the cadmium content was performed by atomic absorption spectrometer Varian 240 Z with GTA 120 graphite furnace. The effect of contamination by cadmium to germination, length of leaves and number of stomata on <b>abaxial</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>leaf</b> was confirmed.

40|$|The {{effects of}} dark {{chilling}} on the leaf-side-specific regulation of photosynthesis were characterized in the C 4 grass Paspalum dilatatum. CO 2 - and light-response curves for photosynthesis and associated parameters were measured on whole leaves and on each leaf side independently under adaxial and abaxial illumination {{before and after}} plants were exposed to dark chilling {{for one or two}} consecutive nights. The stomata closed on the adaxial <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the leaves under abaxial illumination and no CO 2 uptake could be detected on this surface. However, high rates <b>of</b> whole <b>leaf</b> photosynthesis were still observed because CO 2 assimilation rates were increased on the <b>abaxial</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the leaves under abaxial illumination. Under adaxial illumination both leaf surfaces contributed to the inhibition <b>of</b> whole <b>leaf</b> photosynthesis observed after one night of chilling. After two nights of chilling photosynthesis remained inhibited on the <b>abaxial</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leaf</b> but the adaxial side had recovered, an effect related to increased maximal ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylation rates (Vcmax) and enhanced maximal electron transport rates (Jmax). Under abaxial illumination, whole leaf photosynthesis was decreased only after the second night of chilling. The chilling-dependent inhibition of photosynthesis was located largely on the <b>abaxial</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leaf</b> and was related to decreased Vcmax and Jmax, but not to the maximal phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase carboxylation rate (Vpmax).

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate qualitative and quantitative <b>leaf</b> anatomical traits <b>of</b> Palicourea rigida Kunth. (Rubiaceae) species occurring in the Brazilian Cerrado and Campo Rupestre ecosystems. Anatomical analysis was performed in fresh or fixed leaves processed with usual plant microtechnique. Leaves showed uniseriate epidermis in petiole and leaf blade which contains uniseriate nonglandular tricomes (tector type) occurring only over the vascular bundles. Likewise, paracytic stomata were found only in <b>abaxial</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leaf</b> surface. The mesophyll contains uniseriate palisade parenchyma and multiseriate spongy parenchyma (nine layers) which showed cells with different morphology and size.

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} morphological and morphometric {{features of}} vegetative and generative organs of Persica species and varieties under {{the conditions of}} the Forest-Steppe zone of Ukraine for further use in breeding. Methods. Biological (morphological analysis) and statistical (processing of morphometric parameters) ones. Results. It was found that except ternate multiple buds, in peach hybrid ‘Suputnyk’collateral buds were prevalent which was not common to other tested varieties and species. Buds of each species and variety have a certain number of scales. The most scales were observed in ‘Suputnyk’. Pubescence <b>of</b> <b>abaxial</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leaf</b> in P. davіdiana and ‘Suputnyk’ plants was not revealed. Species of P. vulgaris (‘Pecherskyi’, ‘Antotsianovyi’, ‘Poleskyi’) was characterized by increase in size <b>of</b> <b>leaf</b> blades, flowers and fruits.

After 48 h of acquisition access period, inoculation was done using a 'Ring-cage', containing viruliferous whiteflies, attached to the <b>abaxial</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leaf</b> <b>of</b> young tomato plants. 48 hours after acquisition, the whiteflies were eliminated and the inoculated plants were incubated for 28 days under greenhouse conditions.

40|$|Taxonomy: Cladosporium fulvum is an asexual fungus {{for which}} no sexual stage is {{currently}} known. Molecular data, however, support C. fulvum {{as a member of}} the Mycosphaerellaceae, clustering with other taxa having Mycosphaerella teleomorphs. C. fulvum has recently been placed in the anamorph genus Passalora as P. fulva. Its taxonomic disposition is supported by its DNA phylogeny, as well as the distinct scars on its conidial hila, which are typical of Passalora, and unlike Cladosporium s. s., which has teleomorphs that reside in Davidiella, and not Mycosphaerella. Host range and disease symptoms: The presently known sole host of C. fulvum is tomato (members of the genusLycopersicon). C. fulvum is mainly a foliar pathogen. Disease symptoms are most obvious on the <b>abaxial</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leaf</b> and include patches of white mould that turn brown upon sporulation. Due to stomatal clogging, curling of leaves and wilting can occur, leading to defoliation. C. fulvum as a model pathogen: The interaction between C. fulvum and tomato is governed by a gene-for-gene relationship. A total of eight Avr and Ecp genes, and for four of these also the corresponding plant Cf genes, have been cloned. Obtaining conclusive evidence for gene-for-gene relationships is complicated by the poor availability of genetic tools for most Mycosphaerellaceae¿plant interactions. Newly developed tools, including Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and RNAi, added to the genome sequence of its host tomato, which will be available within a few years, render C. fulvum attractive as a model species for plant pathogenic Mycosphaerellacea...|$|R
40|$|Oxygenic {{photosynthesis}} {{is driven}} by photosystems I (PSI) and II (PSII). In plants the number of chlorophylls of PSI versus PSII is adjusted to the light irradiance spectrum. On a timescale of days, this is regulated {{at the level of}} protein concentration. Instead, on a timescale of minutes, it is regulated by the dynamic association of light-harvesting complex II with either PSI or PSII. Thus far very diverse values have been reported for the PSI/PSII chlorophyll ratio, ranging from 0. 54 to 1. 4. The methods used require the isolation of chloroplasts and are time consuming. We present a fluorescence lifetime imaging approach that quantifies the PSI/PSII Chl ratio of chloroplasts directly in their natural leaf environment. In wild type Arabidopsis thaliana plants, grown under white light, the PSI/PSII chlorophyll ratio appeared to be 0. 99 ± 0. 09 at the adaxial side and 0. 83 ± 0. 05 at the <b>abaxial</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leaf.</b> When these plants were acclimated to far red light for several days the PSI/PSII chlorophyll ratio decreased by more than a factor of 3 to compensate for the ineffective far red light absorption of PSII. This shows how plants optimize their light-harvesting capacity to the specific light conditions they encounter. Zooming in on single chloroplasts inside the leaf allowed to study the grana/stroma membrane network and their PSI/PSII chlorophyll ratios. The developed method will be useful to study dynamic processes in chloroplasts in intact leaves which involve changes in the grana and the stroma membranes such as state transitions...|$|R
40|$|Dichapetalum cymosum (poison leaf) is a {{very common}} problem plant in {{southern}} Africa. Fluoroacetic acid, {{believed to be the}} poisonous entity in the plant, is produced by the plant, but the micro-organisms associated with this plant may also {{play a role in the}} production thereof. A previous study on Burolderia cepacia, an endophyte of D. cymosum showed active metabolism of fluoroacetate by this endophyte. The isolated endophytes from D. cymosum were studied to determine whether they synthesise any fluorinated compounds. It seemed from preliminary results that symbionts might play a role in the synthesis of the poisonous entities in D. cymosum, but further investigation is required. The detection of glandular lesions on the <b>abaxial</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leaf</b> led to closer examination and the cross sections revealed unusually deformed epidermis cells with adjacent cells containing vacuoles filled with phenolic-like crystals. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the spongy parenchyma cells directly above the glandular lesions indicated the presence of clusters of small, virus-like particles (VLPs) in the chloroplasts. Observations by TEM showed that these VLPs have analogous structures to phytoferritin. Tapura fischeri (leafberry tree) is a tree member of the same family, and it was found to also contain a fluorinated compound. Endophytes were also found in the plant and similar glandular lesions with analogous VLPs were observed at these sites. This might indicate that endophytes have a share in the biosynthesis of the fluorinated compounds found in Dichapetalaceae. Numerous factors ought to be considered in order to fully understand the chemical ecology of the intricate system regarding the endophytes and the possible toxicity of the family Dichapetalaceae.

40|$|Higher organisms {{progress}} {{through a series}} of phases during development. In plants, the shoot progresses through a juvenile phase and an adult phase and ultimately produces reproductive structures. The transition from juvenile vegetative to adult vegetative development, a process known as phase change or shoot maturation, is marked by changes in morphology, anatomy, and physiology of the vegetative structures produced by the shoot. The duration of each phase directly impacts the morphology of plants because organs produced at different times are located at different positions along the shoot. Although phase change has been studied extensively in woody species, the regulation of this process remains poorly understood. Recently, phase change has been studied in the more genetically tractable herbaceous species maize and Arabidopsis thaliana. In Arabidopsis, the leaves developed along the shoot axis can be distinguished by a number of morphological characteristics. The first leaves produced are small and round with smooth margins, while leaves produced later are larger, more elongated and have serrated margins. Trichome distribution has a phase specific pattern in that leaves produced early in shoot development have trichomes only on their adaxial surface, while leaves produced later have trichomes on both the adaxial and abaxial surfaces. Application of gibberellic acid (GA) accelerates the development of abaxial trichomes. The development of abaxial trichomes is delayed in GA deficient ga 1 - 3 plants. Several mutants were isolated in a screen for precocious abaxial trichome development. Mutations in the gene EARLY TRICHOMES cause plants to produce abaxial trichomes beginning with leaf one. The ert phenotype appears {{to be the result of}} adaxial characteristics being expressed on the <b>abaxial</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leaf,</b> rather than the acceleration of phase change. Mutations in HASTY also accelerate the development of abaxial trichomes. In addition, hst plants have upward rolled leaves, greatly reduced pollen production, and retarded root development.

Over- expression of this gene leads to upward curling <b>of</b> the <b>leaf</b> blade (Shi et al. 2007). SEMI-ROLLED LEAF 1 (SRL 1) is located at plasma membrane and predicted to be a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein. srl 1 mutant exhibits adaxially rolled leaves due to the increased number of bulliform cells at the adaxial cell layers. Further study showed that SRL 1 can inhibit the formation of bulliform cells by regulating the expression of genes encoding vacuolar H+-ATPase subunits and H+-pyrophosphatase negatively (Xiang et al. 2012). LEAF INCLINATION 2 (LC 2) encodes a vernalization insensitive 3 -like protein which {{plays an important role in}} regulating leaf inclination and mediating hormone effects and lc 2 mutants have enlarged leaf angles and abaxial leaf curling (Zhao et al. 2010). ABAXIALLY CURLED LEAF 1 (ACL 1) encodes a protein containing unknown conserved functional domains and over-expression of ACL 1 and its homolog ACL 2 induces abaxial leaf curling (Li et al. 2010). Most recently, a new gene called SRL 2 has been identified and cloned. This gene encodes a novel plant-specific protein of unknown biochemical function. srl 2 mutant has incurved leaves due to the presence of defective sclerenchymatous cells on the <b>abaxial</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leaf</b> and displays narrow leaves and reduced plant height. Double mutant analysis indicated that SRL 2 and SLL 1 /RL 9 function in different ways to regulate abaxial-side leaf development (Liu et al. 2016). At last, ROLLED and ERECT LEAF 1 (REL 1) encoding a novel no known protein is related to the coordination of brassinosteroid (BR) signaling transduction. Also, rel 1 mutant displays rolled and erect <b>leaf</b> and over-expression <b>of</b> REL 1 in WT causes a phenotype similarity to that of the dominant rel 1 mutant. However, down-regulation of the REL 1 gene in the rel 1 mutant restores the mutant phenotype (Chen et al. 2015). Considering the similar phenotype as to rel 1, we named our mutant as rel 2.|$|R
30|$|The {{functions}} <b>of</b> a <b>leaf,</b> including photosynthesis, respiration and transpiration, {{are critical}} for plant survival and are dependent on three-dimensional architecture specific to the plant type (Govaerts et al. 1996). Leaf shape and morphological architecture are considered the most important agronomic traits in rice. Moderate leaf rolling in rice can improve its light capture and gas exchange abilities (Eshed et al. 2001; Moon and Hake. 2011); in addition, appropriate leaf rolling is also related to improved stress responses via reduced direct solar radiation exposure and decreased leaf transpiration under drought stress (Lang et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2009). Therefore, moderate leaf rolling is highly important for increased grain yield in rice. Recently, several genes regulating the leaf rolling phenotype have been identified and characterized in rice. For example, SHALLOT-LIKE 1 (SLL 1)/RL 9, a transcription factor of the KANADI family, regulates leaf abaxial cell development in rice (Yan et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2009). sll 1 mutants display extremely incurved leaves due to the defective development of sclerenchymatous cells on the <b>abaxial</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the leaf; moreover, the overexpression of SLL 1 also resulted in leaf rolling by stimulating phloem development on the <b>abaxial</b> <b>side</b> and suppressing bulliform cell and sclerenchyma development on the adaxial side (Zhang et al. 2009). Adaxialized Leaf 1 (ADL 1) encodes a plant-specific calpain-like Cys protease and {{is required for the}} establishment of the adaxial-abaxial axis in the leaf primordium (Hibara et al. 2009). adl 1 mutants display abaxially rolled leaves due to the increase of bulliform cells on the adaxial side and the formation of bulliform-like cells on the <b>abaxial</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leaf</b> (Hibara et al. 2009). The overexpression <b>of</b> Abaxially Curled <b>Leaf</b> 1 (ACL 1) and its homolog ACL 2 results in abaxial leaf curling due to increased bulliform cell number and size in rice (Li et al. 2010). Rice outermost cell-specific gene 5 (Roc 5), a member of homeodomain leucine zipper class IV, also controls leaf rolling by regulating bulliform cell fate and development (Zou et al. 2011). The ectopic expression of Roc 5 results in adaxially rolled leaves, whereas cosuppression of Roc 5 results in abaxial leaf rolling (Zou et al. 2011). Moreover, several cellulose synthase-like genes and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins have been found to control leaf rolling in rice. The narrow leaf and dwarf 1 (ND 1)/the curled and dwarf leaf 1 (OsCD 1)/the narrow and rolled leaf 1 (OsCslD 4) encodes a member of the cellulose synthase-like D subfamily. Defects in ND 1 /OsCD 1 /OsCslD 4 produced dwarfed plants with narrow and rolled leaves due to changes in cell wall composition (Li et al. 2009; Hu et al. 2010; Luan et al. 2011). Furthermore, SEMI-ROLLED LEAF 1 (SRL 1), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, was found to regulate the formation of bulliform cells in the adaxial cell layers, leading to leaf rolling in rice (Xiang et al. 2012). Recently, a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor (OsZHD 1) was found in rice to induce abaxially curling and drooping due to increased bulliform cell numbers (Xu et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Six aspects {{involved}} in biotechnology applications of Populus alba x P. grandidentata micropropagation were studied: (1) {{the influences of}} medium consistency and shoot density on in vitro shoot proliferation, (2) protoplast isolation and culture of in vitro cultured leaf explants, (3) morphogenetic potential of in vitro cultured leaf, internode, and root explants, (4) influences of subculturing period and different culture media on cold storage of the plantlets, (5) in vivo and in vitro polyploidy induction, and (6) transformation by an Agrobacterium binary vector;For achieving optimum in vitro shoot proliferation from axillary bud culture, liquid medium and shoot density were defined. The results of protoplast culture indicated that the yield of viable protoplasts from in vitro cultured leaf explants was consistently greater than that from leaves of greenhouse grown stock plants. In vitro cultured leaf, internode, and root explants exhibited remarkable morphogenetic potential that can be readily manipulated to form shoots, roots, or calli. <b>Abaxial</b> <b>side</b> culture <b>of</b> entire <b>leaf</b> explants was best suited for inducing adventitious shoots;Subculturing period preceding cold storage, plantlet condition, and culturing medium all had important influences on survival at 4 °C in darkness. Plantlets possessing 4 - 6 axillary shoots that were subcultured on shoot proliferation medium for one month preceding cold storage could be stored at 4 °C in darkness for 24 months;Colchiploid plant material could be obtained by in vivo colchicine treatment of axillary buds and by in vitro adventitious shoot induction from chimeric leaf discs, but not by in vitro colchicine treatment of axillary buds of the Crandon clone. The established micropropagation of the chimeric hybrid poplar can probably be used to isolate tissue and produce plants with the desired ploidy level via leaf explant culture and protoplast culture;Transformed kanamycin resistant calli were obtained by co-culturing an Agrobacterium binary vector pGA 472 containing a neomycin phosphotransferase gene with leaf discs on a selective regeneration medium.

40|$|Two Rhododendron species (R. catawbiense and R. ponticum) {{are used}} to study their {{different}} photoprotective strategies during seasonal cold acclimation at morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and molecular levels. In addition, this dissertation also studied whether or not RcPIP 2 s (R. catawbiense PIP 2 s) expression patterns were associated with thermonastic leaf curling in rhododendrons. Microscopic data revealed that the two Rhododendron species evolved distinct leaf anatomy which could have potential adaptive significance to high light at subfreezing temperatures (chapter 2). Compared with R. catawbiense, R. ponticum has significantly thicker leaf blades but thinner cuticles. There is one layer of upper epidermis and three layers of palisade mesophyll in R. catawbiense, whereas R. ponticum has two distinct layers of upper epidermis and two layers of palisade mesophyll. I suggest that the additional layer of upper epidermis in R. ponticum and thicker cuticle and extra palisade layer in R. catawbiense represent structural adaptations for reducing light injury in leaves and could serve a photoprotective function in winter when leaf photochemistry is generally sluggish. The overall higher opening of stomatal pores per unit leaf area in R. catawbiense indicates that R. catawbiense may be more prone to winter desiccation and that thermonasty may be a particularly beneficial trait in this species by serving as desiccation-avoidance strategy {{in addition to a}} photoprotection role. Comparative study of photoprotection strategies at biochemical and molecular levels during seasonal cold acclimation between the two Rhododendron species suggests that the two species respond differently to winter conditions and have evolved various strategies to reduce and / or tolerate photooxidative stress in winter (chapter 3). In particular, both species have evolved some common strategies including downregulation of photosynthesis capacity, accumulation of early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) and antioxidant systems. R. ponticum accumulates overall higher antioxidant metabolites and enzyme activities, whereas, R. catawbiense has more efficient upregulation of ELIPs and antioxidant systems during seasonal cold acclimation; R. catawbiense also exhibits thermonastic leaf movements. Both species undergo photoinhibition during winter with R. ponticum leaves being relatively less photoinhibited. Such difference may be related to differential sensitivity to excess light in winter and protection efficiencies of ELIPs and antioxidants in the two species, among other adaptations. Although, thermonasty did not seem to provide a clear added advantage to resist photoinhibition in R. catawbiense, its adaptive significance in photoprotection cannot be ruled out. The differences in photoinhibition may also be associated with the distinct leaf anatomies (as shown in chapter 2) in the two species. The additional layer of upper epidermis in R. ponticum, and extra palisade layer and waxy cuticle in R. catawbiense might represent leaf structural adaptations for reducing light injury in winter in these species, and together with ELIPs, antioxidant system and thermonasty constitute photoprotection system in rhododendrons. To investigate whether or not RcPIP 2 s expression patterns were associated with leaf curling, the leaves of the thermonastic and nonthermonastic species (R. catawbiense and R. ponticum, respectively) were exposed to a series of temperature regimes in controlled conditions (chapter 4). Progressively cooler temperatures in the subfreezing range employed in this study induced thermonastic leaf curling in R. catawbiense (and uncurling upon warming), whereas R. ponticum leaves showed no curling. Data of gene expression at the transcriptional level using real-time RT-PCR showed similar expression patterns of RcPIP 2 s across the two species, suggesting that there is no apparent association between RcPIP 2 s expression and leaf curling / no curling in the two Rhododendron species. However, further investigations involving AQP studies at the protein level {{as well as at the}} transcriptional level corresponding to the adaxial and <b>abaxial</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leaf</b> with more thermonastic and nonthermonastic Rhododendron species may provide further insights into the role <b>of</b> AQPs in <b>leaf</b> curling in Rhododendron...|$|R

40|$|Distinctive {{from that}} of the animal system, the basic plan of the plant body is the {{continuous}} formation of a structural unit, composed of a stem with a meristem at the top and lateral organs continuously forming at the meristem. Therefore, mechanisms controlling the formation, maintenance, and development of a meristem will be a key to understanding the body plan of higher plants. Genetic analyses of filamentous flower (fil) mutants have indicated that FIL is required for the maintenance and growth of inflorescence and floral meristems, and of floral organs of Arabidopsis thaliana. FIL encodes a protein carrying a zinc finger and a HMG box-like domain, which is known to work as a transcription regulator. As expected, the FIL protein was shown to have a nuclear location. In situ hybridization clearly demonstrated that FIL is expressed only at the <b>abaxial</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> primordia of leaves and floral organs. Transgenic plants, ectopically expressing FIL, formed filament-like leaves with randomly arranged cells at the leaf margin. Our results indicate that cells at the <b>abaxial</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the lateral organs are responsible for the normal development of the organs as well as for maintaining the activity of meristems...|$|R
