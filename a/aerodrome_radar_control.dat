50|$|The {{specified}} {{mission of}} the 603 ACS was to operate a mobile unit capable of providing <b>radar</b> <b>control</b> and surveillance within a designated area, to collect, display, and disseminate information of aerial activity and to provide radar coverage for the control of air forces. The squadron was further tasked to provide <b>radar</b> <b>control</b> for friendly aircraft in an offensive role against ground targets, and in a defensive mission against airborne threats, as directed.|$|R
5000|$|In June 1989, {{the wing}} was renamed [...] "22 <b>Radar</b> <b>Control</b> Wing". Simultaneously, the eastern control centre was renamed 21 Aerospace Control and Warning Squadron {{and the western}} centre became 51 Aerospace Control & Warning Squadron. Although it resided on CFB North Bay, and the base {{provided}} such things as pay, clothing and medical services, 22 <b>Radar</b> <b>Control</b> Wing was an entirely separate entity from the base with its own commander and staff of personnel.|$|R

40|$|The {{guidance}} of an air-to-air missile is investigated when the radar sensor is supported or {{replaced by an}} imaging sensor. The scenario covers the final approach of a missile in a head-on attack against a maneuvering combat aircraft. For flight under <b>radar</b> <b>control,</b> various guidance laws are considered, starting with proportional navigation. More sophisticated guidance schemes based linear quadratic optimization, pole placement and linear differential game reduce the miss distance to approximately one third. The glint limits further improvement of <b>radar</b> <b>controlled</b> missiles. An imaging sensor in the frequency band of visible light works on a noise level far below that of a radar. In a first step the electro-optica sensor and the radar with their associated filters are working independent- ly. They supply estimates of target's normal acceleration and line-of-sight rate as guidance signals to an augmented proportional navigation. The miss distance sinks to a value better than that for proportional navigation under <b>radar</b> <b>control,</b> but falls behind {{the performance of the}} sophisticated guidance schemes. Coupling of the filters reduces the error to vaues slightly below those obtained under <b>radar</b> <b>control.</b> In the last step of the investigation line-of-sight rate is taken from the imaging sensor and its filter. The smooth and hardly delayed guidance signals of the all optical system lower the miss distance to one tenth of the best achieved under <b>radar</b> <b>control.</b> This favourable result holds for a wide variation of relevant parameters...|$|R

5000|$|The fourth, prior 22 Wing evolved {{out of a}} unit {{called the}} [...] "Radar <b>Control</b> Wing". The <b>Radar</b> <b>Control</b> Wing {{was created by the}} air force in 1987 to run day-to-day air defence {{operations}} in the Underground Complex for the Canadian NORAD Region. When an extraordinary event occurred or was about to occur, such as the approach to Canada of Soviet bombers, the <b>Radar</b> <b>Control</b> Wing alerted the Canadian NORAD Region, and the region's general and selected members of his staff would man a command post {{on the second floor of}} the Underground Complex. The <b>Radar</b> <b>Control</b> Wing and command post would then coordinate their efforts to handle the situation. For example, regarding Soviet bombers, while the <b>Radar</b> <b>Control</b> Wing saw to such activities as intercepting the aircraft and coordinating with civilian air traffic control in the area of the interception to avoid running into airliners, the command post would advise and consult with NORAD Headquarters in Colorado Springs, arrange an AWACS aircraft to assist, if deemed useful, and talk with the adjacent American NORAD region if it looked like the intercepted aircraft would enter their area, too.|$|R
