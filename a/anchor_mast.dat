5000|$|As {{a further}} booster for sales, Réard {{commissioned}} renowned carbody specialist Chapron {{to build an}} extravagant [...] "road yacht" [...] by converting a Packard V8 car into a mock luxury cabin cruiser complete with cockpit, portholes, <b>anchor,</b> signal <b>mast</b> and other nautical regalia. The car (not an amphibian) went on advertising parades and followed the Tour de France cycliste in the early 50's, with a crew of bikini clad girls, causing quite a sensation in period parochial France.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} a {{departure}} from Calatrava's previous designs, which were typically asymmetric shapes <b>anchored</b> by high <b>masts.</b> Another atypical element is the color; while most of Calatrava's designs are white, the Peace Bridge features red and white as used in both the Flag of Canada and the Flag of Calgary.|$|R
50|$|Service Navigation {{obtained}} in 1968 {{the destruction of}} the bridge of Change and the Bridge of the Palais de Justice bridge replaced by the Marshal in June 1983, was inaugurated a new bridge designed by Gilbert Lamboley. 4 m wide, its span of 136 m is suspended by cable stays planted in a single <b>mast</b> <b>anchored</b> on the left bank of the River.|$|R
25|$|The Capitol {{complex is}} fronted and {{highlighted}} by the richly landscaped Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza, named after Wesley Bolin, a governor who died in office in the 1970s. Numerous monuments and memorials are on the site, including the <b>anchor</b> and signal <b>mast</b> from the USS Arizona (one of the U.S. Navy ships sunk in Pearl Harbor) and a granite version of the Ten Commandments.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes, {{even when}} the crew {{think that they have}} safely battled through the storm, and have {{anchored}} in a secure place, the waves dash upon the vessel with such force that the <b>anchor</b> drags, the <b>masts</b> go by the board, and the great ship, with the hundreds of pale faces that crowd her deck, is dashed on the great rocks which loom up in the distance.|$|R

50|$|Rose, {{under the}} command of Captain Matthew Scott, left Port Royal, Jamaica on 26 June 1794. The next day she {{encountered}} a merchant vessel that passed on the news that Admiral Sir John Jervis and his fleet were off Basse Terre, which news led Scott to attempt to meet up with them. The night of 28 June was dark and rain squalls hid the sound of breakers, with the result that at 9pm Rose hit a reef off Rocky Point, Jamaica. The crew threw guns overboard and cut away her <b>anchors,</b> top <b>masts</b> and mizzen-mast, all in a futile attempt to lighten her and get her off the rocks. In the morning, as she filled with water, her crew abandoned ship in her boats and on rafts they fashioned out of booms and spars.|$|R

50|$|The plaza {{is home to}} 30 {{memorials}} {{dedicated to}} topics including important individuals, organizations, and events. Among the more prominent are the <b>mast,</b> <b>anchor,</b> and a 14-inch gun of the USS Arizona, memorials to major wars such as World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, the Korean War and Desert Storm, and America's first monument of the Bill of Rights. Also of note are some memorials that have caused considerable controversy, as mentioned below.|$|R
50|$|On 16-19 September, she was escorting {{a convoy}} from Jamaica {{when they were}} hit by the storm. Frantic {{efforts were made to}} save her. All <b>anchors,</b> cannon, and <b>masts</b> were shipped over the side. The hull was bound {{together}} with rope, officers and men manned the pumps for 24 hours a day for 3 days. However despite all the water continued to rise. The exhausted crew were rescued by nearby merchantmen, and the last man, Captain Sylverius Moriarty, set her on fire as he left.|$|R
50|$|Torreta de Guardamar is a mast {{radiator}} insulated {{against ground}} {{used for the}} transmission of orders to submerged submarines. It is made as a lattice structure with triangular cross section. As it is, {{in spite of its}} enormous height, still low in relation to the wavelength of the waves it transmits, its capacity is augmented by multiple cables connected to its top and running to <b>anchors</b> around the <b>mast.</b> These cables are electrically connected to the mast and are divided at a certain distance by insulators.|$|R
2500|$|The master’s main {{duty was}} navigation, taking the ship’s {{position}} at least daily {{and setting the}} sails as appropriate for the required course and conditions.

[...] The master also {{was in charge of}} stowing the hold and ensuring the ship was not too weighted down to sail effectively. [...] The master, through his subordinates, hoisted and lowered the anchor, docked and undocked the ship, and inspected the ship daily for problems with the <b>anchors,</b> sails, <b>masts,</b> ropes, or pulleys.

The deck presents a circular configuration, in plant, and is suspended from eight cables connecting it to the extremity of a steel <b>mast</b> <b>anchored</b> to a concrete bulk situated on the riverside. The dynamic measurements were aimed to control the force installed in the cables during the tension operation and to characterize the dynamic parameters through output-only modal identification techniques in order to calibrate a Finite Element model.

50|$|Another {{recently}} built {{building is}} East Croydon station, {{one of the}} busiest in Greater London. The present East Croydon station building was opened on 19 August 1992. It consists of a large steel and glass frame suspended from a lightweight steel structure that straddles the track and platforms to a much greater extent than was possible with its Victorian predecessor. Four steel ladder <b>masts</b> <b>anchor</b> the glass box and the whole gives the impression of a suspension bridge that stretches into the distance. External canopies cover the entrances, a cafes open-air seating area and the approaches to the tram station. 440 m² of glass were used in the roof and 800 m² for the wall glazing.

40|$|A {{solar sail}} concept has been {{developed}} from a common spiral fold pattern in order to enable a simultaneous mast and sail deployment. This novel concept utilizes the stored strain energy {{in a series of}} elastic spar members to enforce proper folding kinematics rather than relying on bulky mechanical joints. The critical inner and outer spar networks are secured to four elastically extendible <b>masts</b> <b>anchored</b> to a central drum. Deployment of the solar sail system is actuated by rotating the central drum around which the masts, spars, and film are wrapped. Tensioned radial cords deterministically unfold the membrane film under the authority of the resilient, spring-like spar members. Proper elastic behavior of the spars is an important facet to this design, and thus a significant effort was dedicated their development. This compact ground demonstration concept includes about 7. 5 m 2 of reflective membrane film for useful propulsion. Features of this robust, lightweight membrane structure may prove valuable to reducing mass and increasing deployment reliability of other planar subsystems such as sun shades, solar arrays, radiators, or antenna arrays...|$|R
40|$|Mast {{cells are}} {{critical}} component of the immune system. In pathological situations, they are activated and are responsible for allergic reaction. Therefore, detail understanding of mast cell activation at molecular level is important for design of new therapies of allergic diseases. Principal transmembrane receptor of mast cells is the high-affinity Fc receptor for IgE (FcεRI). FcεRI <b>anchors</b> IgE on <b>mast</b> cell surface and upon cross-linking with multivalent antigen it becomes phosphorylated at its intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). This triggers signaling cascade leading to cell degranulation and cytokine production. The antigen- mediated signaling through the FcεRI is critically dependent on interplay with intracellular protein- tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate the ITAM motifs and many other components of the signaling pathway. This study was focused on better understanding of signaling events leading to mast cell activation; emphasis was put on early activation events. First, we examined the role of protein- tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) in FcεRI phosphorylation. We found that upon antigen triggering of FcεRI, PTPs undergo inhibition by oxidation of their active site located tyrosine. Studies of plasma membrane topography of inactivated PTPs showed their [...] ...|$|R
