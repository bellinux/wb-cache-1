40|$|State of Research at Project Start: Usually the {{reliability}} of printed circuit boards is tested by thermal cycling methods. In this connection an evidence providing result is reached not before several thousand cycles. They take between 5 and 15 weeks of duration. Therefore some authors presented short time methods which were determined to replace the thermomechanical stress by an isothermal mechanical stress. This was done by using the three-point bending test. Its correlation with the thermomechanical method has been determined only to a small extend. Reason/Aim of the investigation: Beneath {{the aim of the}} compound project to approve {{the reliability}} of deplaced solder joints this partial project studied the correlatibility of the previously developed four-point <b>alternating</b> <b>bending</b> test method with thermal cycling strains. Method: The four-point <b>alternating</b> <b>bending</b> test procedure has been applicated on especially designed pcb's using four different methods for failure detection.

40|$|The bony trabeculae in the {{superior}} articular {{processes of the}} lumbar vertebrae form a series of overlapping pointed arches that correspond to the lines of stress produced during rotation. By using a photoelastic model, it has been possible to demonstrate that this structural arrangement is a functional adaptation to alternate lateral and medial bending movements. The functional significance of the articular processes is obviously to limit rotation, which can {{take place in the}} lumbar segment of the vertebral column during any asymmetrical movement of the body. The <b>alternate</b> <b>bending</b> movements of {{the superior}} articular processes arise partly from the laterally directed pressure of the corresponding inferior process, and partly from the medially directed pull of the firm 'transverse strengthening ligaments' of the joint capsule...|$|E

The purpose of this process is to correct the curvature defaults of the rolled bar. Indeed, the bar must be straight before being sent to the client and a straightened uniform surface layer is appreciated. With the apparition of new grades and also new diameters of steel round bars, it becomes essential to better understand the straightening process in order to (i) have a better knowledge of what the round bar undergoes during the process, (ii) precisely understand the straightening process, the effect of each component and the process parameters.

40|$|Aim of {{the paper}} is to propose a new {{approach}} for {{the determination of the}} so termed self-damping, or internal damping, of metallic cables. The formulation is developed starting from a recent mechanical model of a strand, from which the hysteretic bending behavior of stranded cables is derived. Each wire of the cable is individually modeled as an elastic curved thin rod. A kinematic model is defined to relate the axial strain and bending curvature of the strand to the generalized strains of the wire. The interaction among the wires belonging to adjacent layers is then studied by neglecting deformations of the contact surfaces and assuming a classic Amontons–Coulomb friction law. In the adopted strand mechanical model a function is derived, which defines the domain of admissible values of the wire axial force to prevent sliding. A simplified model of the cable hysteretic bending behavior is then derived from the cyclic response predicted with the adopted mechanical formulation of the strand, leading to a closed-form upper-bound estimate of the energy dissipated when the cable cross section is subjected to <b>alternate</b> <b>bending.</b> This expression is used as the starting block for the definition of an analytical equation giving an upper-bound estimate of the cable self-damping. The predictions of the proposed model are compared to available data resulting from experiments and empirical literature equations: the comparison is extended {{to a wide range of}} strands and parameters that characterize practically most of the configuration commonly used in overhead electrical lines...|$|E
40|$|Carbon-fibre {{reinforced}} plastics {{have been widely}} used in the aerospace industry as materials for structural components. During recent years, the focus has been on preform/RTM materials with the aim of improving material properties and reducing costs. Harnessing the full potential of these materials requires a model for assessing the properties and in particular long-term behaviour. Such a model needs {{to take into account the}} special conditions of these materials. Basic failure mechanisms have to be analysed in order to develop this kind of model. Consequently, the aim of the work was to investigate the fatigue phenomenon in preform-CFRP materials with thermoset matrices on a microstructural level. The influence of the dynamic loading and the temperature on the emerging fracture phenomena should be identified. Based on the results, a common fracture mechanism should be found. The failure should be described on a mesoscopic level so that it is not restricted on the fatigue failure at a single crack front. To achieve this aim, different preform materials with EP matrix (some of which had been subjected to impact) were loaded with dynamic compression load and high frequent <b>alternate</b> <b>bending.</b> The fatigue behaviour of the matrix systems was investigated by CT tests. By means of microfractography, the only method for detecting fatigue failure as such, the failure mechanisms were analysed at submicroscopic level. The results showed correlations between microstructure and failure. It became apparent that what in the technical literature has been given as an explanation for the appearance of the fatigue striations in the scanning electron microscope had to be corrected. As undercuts are not reflected in the SEM as dark striations, the appearance of the striations must be based on different inclinations of the local fractured surface to the primary electron beam. On the basis of this result the shape and the formation of the fatigue striations could be shown in resin pockets and fibre imprints. Fatigue striations have a shape which sticks out from the fracture plane, preferably in the form of steps. There was no proof for an influence of the high frequent load on the formation of fatigue striations. However, it was possible to find lamellar fracture phenomena which have not been described in the technical literature yet. Due to their shape and their occurrence these can be understood rather as a sign of a dynamic load then as a fracture phenomenon of a high frequent cyclic loading. The examinations of the high frequent loaded samples, where temperatures up to 120 °C occurred, as well as in the CT tests with elevated temperatures (60...|$|E
