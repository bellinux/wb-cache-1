5|$|By 1965 pirate radio had a British {{audience}} of 10 to 15 million, and by 1966 sold almost £2million worth of advertising {{a year to}} customers including the government-funded Egg Marketing Board. Radio Caroline's audience was one third {{the size of the}} Light Programme in the parts of the country where it could be received, but the Light Programme's audience did not decrease, indicating that pirate radio appealed to <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>that</b> the BBC did not serve.|$|E
5|$|The first {{performances}} {{by the full}} line up of Buena Vista Social Club, including Cooder, were those filmed by Wenders in Amsterdam and New York.

5|$|The {{instruments}} used {{in musical}} entertainment are either solely the human voice (2, 6) or solely instrumental (1, 3) {{or some combination}} of the two (4, 5, 7, 8). Whether the performance is given by vocalists or instrumentalists, the performers may be soloists or part of a small or large group, in turn entertaining <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>that</b> might be individual (10), passing by (3), small (1, 2) or large (6, 7, 8, 9). Singing is generally accompanied by instruments although some forms, notably a cappella and overtone singing, are unaccompanied. Modern concerts often use various special effects and other theatrics to accompany performances of singing and dancing (7).|$|E
5|$|Returning to the {{familiar}} Paris salons, Offenbach quietly shifted the emphasis of his work from being a cellist who also composed to being a composer who played the cello. He had already published many compositions, {{and some of them}} had sold well, but now he began to write, perform and produce musical burlesques as part of his salon presentations. He amused the comtesse de Vaux's 200 guests with a parody of Félicien David's currently fashionable Le désert, and in April 1846 gave a concert at which seven operatic items of his own composition were premiered before <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>that</b> included leading music critics. After some encouragement and some temporary setbacks, he seemed on the verge of breaking into theatrical composition when Paris was convulsed by the 1848 revolution, which swept Louis Philippe from the throne and led to serious bloodshed in the streets of the capital. Offenbach hastily took Hérminie and their recently born daughter to join his family in Cologne. He thought it politic to revert temporarily to the name Jacob.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{begins the}} day before <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>that</b> Ai has {{obtained}} with Argaven Harge, the king of Karhide. Ai manages this through the help of Estraven, the prime minister, who seems to believe in Ai's mission, but {{the night before the}} audience, Estraven tells Ai that he can no longer support Ai's cause with the king. Ai begins to doubt Estraven's loyalty because of his strange mannerisms, which Ai finds effeminate and ambiguous. The behavior of people in Karhide is dictated by shifgrethor, an intricate set of unspoken social rules and formal courtesy. Ai does not understand this system, thus making it difficult for him to understand Estraven's motives, and contributing to his distrust of Estraven. The next day, as he prepares to meet the King, Ai learns that Estraven has been accused of treason, and exiled from the country. The pretext for Estraven's exile was his handling of a border dispute with the neighboring country of Orgoreyn, in which Estraven was seen as being too conciliatory. Ai meets with the king, who rejects his offer to join the Ekumen. Discouraged, Ai decides to travel through Karhide, as the spring has just begun, rendering the interior of the country accessible.|$|E

Viewership in 2013 was 808,000, down from 914,000 in 2012. Conan does well in ratings among low income inner city viewers.

25|$|At one point, the program's {{popularity}} positioned it as {{the most}} widely recorded television show in the United States. Also, in a departure from societal norms at the time, All My Children, in the mid-1970s, had <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>that</b> {{was estimated to be}} 30% male. The show ranked No. 1 in the daytime Nielsen ratings in the 1978–79 season. Throughout most of the 1980s and into the early 1990s, All My Children was the No. 2 daytime soap opera on the air. However, {{like the rest of the}} soap operas in the United States, All My Children experienced unprecedented declines in its daytime ratings during the 2000s.

25|$|Social Networks {{are used}} also to {{communicate}} scientists research results {{and as a}} public communication tool and to connect people who share the same professional interests, their benefits can {{vary according to the}} discipline. The most interesting aspects of social networks for professional purposes are their potentialities in terms of dissemination of information and the ability to reach and multiply professional contacts exponentially. Social networks like Academia.edu, LinkedIn, Facebook, and ResearchGate give the possibility to join professional groups and pages, to share papers and results, publicize events, to discuss issues and create debates. Academia.edu is extensively used by researchers, where they follow a combination of social networking and scholarly norms. ResearchGate is also widely used by researchers, especially to disseminate and discuss their publications, where it seems to attract <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>that</b> it wider than just other scientists.|$|E
25|$|Market analysts had a mixed {{response}} to the October 2016 announcement of the Nintendo Switch. Following the financially under-performing Wii U, analysts had expected that Nintendo would recognize their vulnerable position in the console market when developing their next console, believing that the company would find a means to draw back the core gamer market. Instead, initial promotion of the Switch appeared to appeal to <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>that</b> fell between the core gamer and casual gamer markets, the latter being mobile game players who would want a more engaging experience but would {{not be willing to}} play for hours at a time, according to The New York Times. Analysts were unsure if such a market existed in large enough numbers to justify the Switch. Other concerns about the Switch's announcement were related to yet-to-be-confirmed details that could make or break the system, such as its retail price, whether the unit includes a touchscreen, the unit's battery life, and the type of games that development partners would bring to the console.|$|E

500|$|Koen Decoster {{proposes that}} Josephus wrote of [...] "a citadel {{in the lower}} part of the city" [...] to <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>that</b> would have been {{familiar}} with the Jerusalem of the 1st century CE—a city that did feature two citadels: the Antonia Fortress and the Herodian palace. As Josephus' Roman Jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill, [...] "a citadel in the lower city" [...] could have referred to anything located east of the Tyropoeon Valley, including the Antonia which stood north of the Temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it. In his view, this is the place Josephus must have had in mind when he wrote of the Acra.|$|E
5000|$|The {{universal}} <b>audience</b> is <b>an</b> imagined <b>audience</b> <b>that</b> {{serves as}} <b>an</b> ethical and argumentative {{test for the}} rhetor.

The concept of the universal audience has received criticism for being idealistic because it can be considered as an impediment in achieving persuasive effect with particular audiences. Yet, it still may be useful as an ethical guide for a speaker and a critical tool for <b>a</b> reader or <b>audience.</b>|$|R
