5|$|To {{produce the}} 767, Boeing formed {{a network of}} {{subcontractors}} which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from Italy's Aeritalia and Japan's CTDC. The wings and cabin floor were produced in-house, while Aeritalia provided control surfaces, Boeing Vertol made the leading edge for the wings, and Boeing Wichita produced the forward fuselage. The CTDC provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies, namely Fuji Heavy Industries (wing fairings and gear doors), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (center fuselage), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (rear fuselage, doors, and tail). Components were integrated during final assembly at the Everett factory. For expedited production of wing spars, the main structural member of <b>aircraft</b> <b>wings,</b> the Everett factory received robotic machinery to automate the process of drilling holes and inserting fasteners. This method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 747. Final assembly of the first aircraft began in July 1979.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the athlete}} has taken flight, {{characteristics}} {{similar to that}} of a glider come into force. Ski flyers are able to cover such tremendous distances and land safely primarily due to the skis they use, which are substantially wider and longer than their cross-country or Alpine skiing counterparts. Each ski is first attached securely {{at the front of the}} boot, which has an exaggerated forward slant; the heel is then attached to a wedge on the ski using a hinged binding peg or strap with a maximum length of , allowing the athlete to lean forward into their preferred aerodynamic position and spread the skis wide apart. Much like <b>aircraft</b> <b>wings,</b> the skis are flexible to an extent, resulting in them bending and vibrating significantly upon takeoff. Maintaining stability in the air is paramount: a loss of balance, or a differential pressure under the skis, can lead to disaster (see list of ski flying accidents). A few athletes have a natural tendency to drift over to one side of the hill, invariably shortening their jump distance.|$|E

40|$|Equivalent plate {{analysis}} {{is often used}} to replace the computationally expensive finite element analysis in initial design stages or in conceptual design of <b>aircraft</b> <b>wing</b> structures. The equivalent plate model {{can also be used to}} design a wind tunnel model to match the stiffness characteristics of the wing box of a full-scale <b>aircraft</b> <b>wing</b> model while satisfying strength-based requirements An equivalent plate analysis technique is presented to predict the static and dynamic response of an <b>aircraft</b> <b>wing</b> with or without damage. First, a geometric scale factor and a dynamic pressure scale factor are defined to relate the stiffness, load and deformation of the equivalent plate to the <b>aircraft</b> <b>wing.</b> A procedure using an optimization technique is presented to create scaled equivalent plate models from the full scale <b>aircraft</b> <b>wing</b> using geometric and dynamic pressure scale factors. The scaled models are constructed by matching the stiffness of the scaled equivalent plate with the scaled <b>aircraft</b> <b>wing</b> stiffness. It is demonstrated that the scaled equivalent plate model can be used to predict the deformation of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>wing</b> accurately. Once the full equivalent plate geometry is obtained, any other scaled equivalent plate geometry can be obtained using the geometric scale factor. Next, an average frequency scale factor is defined as the average ratio of the frequencies of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>wing</b> to the frequencies of the full-scaled equivalent plate. The average frequency scale factor combined with the geometric scale factor is used to predict the frequency response of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>wing</b> from the scaled equivalent plate analysis. A procedure is outlined to estimate the frequency response and the flutter speed of an <b>aircraft</b> <b>wing</b> from the equivalent plate analysis using the frequency scale factor and geometric scale factor. The equivalent plate {{analysis is}} demonstrated using an <b>aircraft</b> <b>wing</b> without damage and another with damage. Both of the problems show that the scaled equivalent plate analysis can be successfully used to predict the frequencies and flutter speed of a typical <b>aircraft</b> <b>wing...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During {{the process}} of <b>aircraft</b> <b>wing</b> finish machining, it is {{required}} to calculate the posture of <b>aircraft</b> <b>wing</b> to guide its adjustment. This paper proposes a new method to calculate the posture for <b>aircraft</b> <b>wing</b> finishing machining, through analyzing the level-measuring principle of <b>aircraft</b> <b>wing.</b> The proposed method {{is based on the}} iterative closest point algorithm (ICP), which transforms the posture evaluation problem into a registration problem between space points and surface. It repeats two processes, finding the nearest points and calculating the optimal transformation, until the convergence criteria of correctly matching are well satisfied. It also has an important part matching priority so that it could satisfy the different accuracy requirements of different metrical points. A case is presented to validate the proposed method, and the results suggest its feasibility...|$|R

25|$|The antenna {{for such}} a system {{would have to be}} large only in the {{horizontal}} direction, and could be very thin vertically. This had advantages for installation on aircraft, but it would be even more practical if the beam could be steered electronically, as opposed to mechanically. By delaying the signal slightly as it travelled down the long antenna, which could be arranged through a number of means, the phase angle would vary, causing the resulting signal to be focussed in a given direction. Since the antenna didn't have to move in order to scan, this led to the possibility of embedding the antenna in the leading edges of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>wings,</b> or similar solutions.|$|E
25|$|On 19 December 2014 the EU {{requested}} WTO mediated {{consultations with}} the US over the tax incentives {{given by the}} state of Washington to large civil aircraft manufacturers which they believed violated the earlier WTO ruling, on 22 April 2015 {{at the request of the}} EU a WTO panel was set up to rule on the complaint. The tax incentives given {{by the state of}} Washington and believed to be the largest in US history surpassing the previous record of $5.6bn over 30 years awarded by the state of New York to the aluminum producer Alcoa in 2007. The $8.7bn over 40 years incentive to Boeing to manufacture the 777X in the state includes $4.2bn from a 40% reduction in business taxes, £3.5bn in tax credits for the firm, a $562m tax credit on property and buildings belonging to Boeing, a $242m sales tax exemption for buying computers and $8m to train 1000 workers, Airbus alleges this is larger than the budgeted cost of Boeing's 777X development program and the EU argues amounts to an entire publicly funded free aircraft program for Boeing, the legislation was an extension of the duration of a tax break program given to Boeing for Dreamliner development that had already been ruled illegal by the WTO in 2012. Boeing defends the allegation by arguing the subsidies are available to anyone however for an aircraft to qualify for the tax breaks a company must manufacture <b>aircraft</b> <b>wings</b> and perform all final assembly for an aircraft model or variant exclusively in the state.|$|E
500|$|Because {{of the way}} Concorde's delta-wing {{generated}} lift, the undercarriage had to be unusually {{strong and}} tall {{to allow for the}} angle of attack at low speed. At rotation, Concorde would rise to a high angle of attack, about 18 degrees. Prior to rotation the wing generated almost no lift, unlike typical <b>aircraft</b> <b>wings.</b> Combined with the high airspeed at rotation (199 knots indicated airspeed), this increased the stresses on the main undercarriage {{in a way that was}} initially unexpected during the development and required a major redesign. Due to the high angle needed at rotation, a small set of wheels were added aft to prevent tailstrikes. The main undercarriage units swing towards each other to be stowed but due to their great height also need to contract in length telescopically before swinging to clear each other when stowed. The four main wheel tyres on each bogie unit are inflated to [...] The twin-wheel nose undercarriage retracts forwards and its tyres are inflated to a pressure of , and the wheel assembly carries a spray deflector to prevent standing water being thrown up into the engine intakes.
