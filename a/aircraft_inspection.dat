This multi-partner project involves research laboratories and industry. Research around this prototype was developed in three domains: autonomous navigation, nondestructive testing and human-robot collaboration.|$|E
5|$|Air-Cobot is {{presented}} as the first robot able to perform visual inspections of <b>aircraft.</b> <b>Inspection</b> robots using other types of sensors have been considered before, such as the European project Robair.

500|$|By 1927, Cobby {{had been}} {{promoted}} to squadron leader, and the following year went to England to attend RAF Staff College, Andover. [...] Returning to Australia, he took over as CO of No.3 Squadron at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, from Squadron Leader Frank Lukis on 13January 1930. At this time, the position of No.3 Squadron commander doubled as CO of the base. Though popular with his staff, Cobby was not known for his attention to detail. In December 1930, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Commodore Richard Williams, arrived for an inspection and found the base to be {{in such a state}} of untidiness that he ordered every man on parade and gave them what was described as [...] "an almighty dressing down", threatening that Christmas leave would be cancelled unless the place was cleaned up. Having handed over to Squadron Leader Bill Bostock on 22November 1931, Cobby was promoted to wing commander on 1May 1933 and subsequently served as RAAF Director of Intelligence. [...] In this position he headed an interdepartmental committee that was formed in August 1933 to examine the possibilities of air survey and aerial photography to further national development. The committee's findings, presented in April 1934, favoured employing government agencies for such work and ultimately {{led to the formation of}} the North Australian Survey Flight from staff and aircraft of No.1 Squadron in April 1935. The resulting surveys of Queensland and the Northern Territory provided valuable input for the establishment of military airfields and other installations following the outbreak of World WarII. Restless in the inter-war years, Cobby retired from the Air Force to join the Civil Aviation Board as Controller of Operations in 1936; he also contributed to aviation magazines such as Australian Airmen and Popular Flying. His civil aviation duties included <b>aircraft</b> <b>inspection,</b> the issuing of licences and airworthiness certificates, maintenance of radio and meteorological services, and RAAF liaison.|$|E
