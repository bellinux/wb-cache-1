5|$|Cloud won the Best Student Philosophy {{award for}} artistic {{achievement}} at the Slamdance Guerrilla Games Competition <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Student</b> Showcase award at the Independent Games Festival. It was showcased on Spike TV, G4TV, and CBS Sunday. The game immediately received {{a great deal}} of attention when it was released; site traffic overran the server they were hosting the website on, and then crashed those of the school. By February 2006, just over three months after its release, the website had been viewed over onemillion times and the game downloaded over 300,000 times. By July 2006, it had reached sixmillion visits and 600,000 downloads.|$|E

5|$|In November 2016, the {{university}} {{announced that it}} {{plans to build a}} £300 million Temple Quarter Campus for c. 5,000 students, next to Bristol Temple Meads railway station within Bristol Temple Quarter Enterprise Zone. The new campus, which will include a business school, digital research facilities <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> village, is expected to open in 2021. For the existing campus, there are plans to remodel Tyndall Avenue, pedestrianise the surrounding area and build a new library and resource hub.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy decided {{toward the}} end of 1871 to end his {{business}} partnership with Eddy. She had accused him in front of others of cheating at cards; it was one of several scenes she had caused between them and he walked out on her. There was a temporary reconciliation, but he was unhappy about the abandonment of head rubbing, and after a dispute between Eddy <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> over a refund was played out in the local press, he decided to go his own way.|$|E
5|$|On-campus {{facilities}} {{include a}} gym, sports hall, a floodlit all-weather football pitch and tennis courts. RNC's thePoint4 complex offers sporting, leisure and conference facilities, {{as well as}} a bistro, and is open to both students and members of the general public. Other facilities at RNC include the Flexible Learning Centre, which features the latest assistive technology and learning resources and is open seven days a week, a student social club which is licensed to sell alcohol to students who are 18 and over, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> common room.

50|$|While it is {{difficult}} to grade students on participation in a classroom setting because of its subjective nature, one method of grading participation is to use self- and peer-assessment. Professors Ryan, Marshall, Porter, <b>and</b> Jia conducted <b>an</b> experiment to see if using students to grade participation was effective. They found that there was a difference between a teacher’s evaluation of participation <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>student’s.</b> However, there was no academic significance, indicating that student’s final grades were not affected by the difference in <b>a</b> teacher’s evaluation <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>student’s.</b> They concluded that self- <b>and</b> peer-assessment is <b>an</b> effective way to grade classroom participation.|$|R
5|$|Other {{projects}} {{that have not}} begun construction are another Early Childhood/Pre-K Childhood center, classroom and gymnasium additions, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Student</b> Services Center Parking Lot. The district also plans many general updates to all campuses such as school entry improvements, a digital radio communication center, and site improvements. There will also be technology additions (such as 1:1 computers at newly built Klein Cain High School in 2017) and multiple facility capital projects. High School Career and Technology Education programs, music instruments, furniture, and buses are also receiving funding in the 2015 bond.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher's {{economic}} policy {{was influenced by}} monetarist thinking and economists such as Milton Friedman and Alan Walters. Together with Chancellor of the Exchequer Geoffrey Howe, she lowered direct taxes on income and increased indirect taxes. She increased interest rates to slow {{the growth of the}} money supply and thereby lower inflation, introduced cash limits on public spending, and reduced expenditure on social services such as education and housing. Cuts to higher education resulted in her becoming the first Oxford-educated post-war Prime Minister without an honorary doctorate from Oxford University, after a 738–319 vote of the governing assembly <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> petition.|$|E
5|$|The Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) is {{a nonprofit}} trade {{association}} for public relations professionals headquartered in New York City. It was founded in 1947 by combining the American Council on Public Relations and the National Association of Public Relations Councils. That year it had its first annual conference and award ceremony. In the 1950s and 1960s, the society created its code of conduct, accreditation program <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> society called the Public Relations Student Society of America. In the 1970s and 1980s, its membership attained a stronger female demographic and the society had its first female Presidents. PRSA created a definition of public relations in 1982, which was updated with a crowd-sourced version in 2011.|$|E

5|$|A plan {{to fill in}} {{a section}} of the canal in Nottingham {{resulted}} in a number of letters appearing in the local press in 1963, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> at Kesteven College produced a report {{on the state of the}} canal, which was presented to the Grantham Civic Society. In 1970, the British Waterways Board attempted to obtain an act of parliament which would have allowed them to cease maintaining the water levels of the canal. The Inland Waterways Association campaigned against the bill, and the clause was amended. The Grantham Canal Society was formed soon afterwards, to promote restoration of the waterway. In 1974, a National Boat Rally was held at Nottingham, to gain support for the restoration scheme, and to promote the idea of a new link to the Trent, which would pass through old gravel workings.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} University of Alabama, Applewhite moved to Houston, Texas, in 1965 {{to teach at}} the University of St. Thomas. His {{students}} regarded him as an engaging speaker and a stylish dresser. He served {{as chair of the}} music department; he also became a locally popular singer, serving as the choral director of an Episcopal church and performing with the Houston Grand Opera. In Texas, he was briefly openly gay but also pursued a relationship with a young woman, who left him under pressure from her family, greatly upsetting him. He resigned from the University of St. Thomas in 1970, citing depression and other emotional problems. Robert Balch and David Taylor, sociologists who studied Applewhite's group, speculate that this departure was prompted by another affair between Applewhite <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>student.</b> The president of the university later recalled that he was often mentally jumbled and disorganized {{near the end of his}} employment.|$|E
5|$|During the 1650s, Ashmole {{devoted a}} great deal of energy to the study of alchemy. In 1650, he {{published}} Fasciculus Chemicus under the anagrammatic pseudonym James Hasolle. This work was an English translation of two Latin alchemical works, one by Arthur Dee, the son of John Dee. In 1652, he published his most important alchemical work, Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum, an extensively annotated compilation of metaphysical poems in English. The book preserved and made available many works that had previously existed only in privately held manuscripts. A corrected edition using Ashmole's two errata sheets and the additional chapter seven of a piece by Thomas Charnock was published in 2011. There is little evidence that Ashmole conducted his own alchemical experiments. He {{appears to have been a}} collector of alchemical writings <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> of alchemy rather than an active practitioner, and refers to himself as a pupil of William Backhouse. His final alchemical publication was The Way to Bliss in 1658, but thereafter his interest seems to wane in favour of his other pursuits. Ashmole promoted the use of therapeutic remedies drawing on both Galenic and Paracelsian principles, and his works attempt to merge the two schools. The Way to Bliss recommends ways to prevent illness: a balanced diet, moderate exercise and enough sleep. His works were avidly studied by other natural philosophers, such as Isaac Newton.|$|E

5|$|Forest Hill {{was a new}} air base, {{and roads}} and {{buildings}} were still under construction when its first course of flying training commenced with Avro Ansons on 29July 1940. One of the Ansons crashed in August, killing its instructor <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>student.</b> Later that month the second flying course began, on CAC Wirraways. The school was then reorganised into Initial and Advanced Squadrons. On 29September, two Ansons collided in mid-air and became locked together. Both navigators bailed out, to be followed shortly afterwards by the injured pilot of the lower aircraft. The pilot of the upper Anson, however, {{found that he was}} able to control the interlocked aircraft using his ailerons and flaps, coupled with the engine power of the Anson underneath. He then managed to make a successful emergency landing in a paddock near the town of Brocklesby.|$|E
5|$|Kellee Santiago is a Venezuelan-American {{video game}} {{designer}} and producer. She is the co-founder {{and former president}} of thatgamecompany. Santiago was born in Caracas, Venezuela and was raised in Richmond, Virginia, where she played video games from a young age and was encouraged by her software engineer father to experiment with computers. While attending New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, she became active in experimental theater, and intended to pursue it after earning a master's degree in the Interactive Media Program of the School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California. While there, however, she became involved in video game design, and produced Cloud, a game developed by Jenova Chen <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> team. Its success sparked her and Chen to found thatgamecompany upon graduating, and she became the president.|$|E

40|$|To reduce {{failure rate}} of first year students, {{predicting}} their likely performance would help targeted support. The performance of <b>students</b> in <b>a</b> STS course has been examined using {{a number of}} parameters. Student performance correlated with <b>a</b> <b>student’s</b> prior educational performance in secondary school <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>student’s</b> attendance at tutorials. In particular, students in {{the lower half of}} their secondary school cohort were more likely to fail. A link between lower tutorial attendance rates and failing the STS course is also noted, with lower attendance rates occurring from the first tutorial, so students who miss early tutorials should also receive early intervention. <b>Student</b> age <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>student’s</b> family income were poor predictors of <b>student</b> performance. <b>A</b> <b>student’s</b> mark in the course tended to increase as student age increased. The rank score given to students who enter university via an alternate pathway was a poor predictor of performance. Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd...|$|R
