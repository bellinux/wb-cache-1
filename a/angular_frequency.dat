25|$|In {{the table}} below, several flow {{quantities}} and parameters according to Airy wave theory are given. The given quantities {{are for a}} bit more general situation as for the solution given above. Firstly, the waves may propagate in an arbitrary horizontal direction in the x=(x,y) plane. The wavenumber vector is k, and is perpendicular to the cams of the wave crests. Secondly, allowance is made for a mean flow velocity U, in the horizontal direction and uniform over (independent of) depth z. This introduces a Doppler shift in the dispersion relations. At an Earth-fixed location, the observed <b>angular</b> <b>frequency</b> (or absolute <b>angular</b> <b>frequency)</b> is ω. On the other hand, in a frame of reference moving with the mean velocity U (so the mean velocity as observed from this reference frame is zero), the <b>angular</b> <b>frequency</b> is different. It is called the intrinsic <b>angular</b> <b>frequency</b> (or relative <b>angular</b> <b>frequency),</b> denoted as σ. So in pure wave motion, with U=0, both frequencies ω and σ are equal. The wave number k (and wavelength λ) are independent of the frame of reference, and have no Doppler shift (for monochromatic waves).|$|E
25|$|The {{speed of}} {{rotation}} is given by the <b>angular</b> <b>frequency</b> (rad/s) or frequency (turn/s, turns per minute), or period (seconds, days, etc.). The time-rate of change of <b>angular</b> <b>frequency</b> is angular acceleration (rad/s²), This change is caused by torque. The ratio of the two (how heavy is it to start, stop, or otherwise change rotation) is given by the moment of inertia.|$|E

The field test shows that the model can simulate the color-mixing process in the aspects of color-mixing order, and shape and position of color-mixing spot.

25|$|This {{can also}} {{be viewed as a}} high-pass {{electronic}} filter. It is a filter with a single zero at DC (i.e., where <b>angular</b> <b>frequency</b> nbsp&radians) and gain. The high-pass characteristics of a differentiating amplifier (i.e., the low-frequency zero) can lead to stability challenges when the circuit is used in an analog servo loop (e.g., in a PID controller with a significant derivative gain). In particular, as a root locus analysis would show, increasing feedback gain will drive a closed-loop pole toward marginal stability at the DC zero introduced by the differentiator.|$|E
25|$|When {{measuring}} optical phonon {{energy by}} experiment, optical phonon frequencies are sometimes given in spectroscopic wavenumber notation, where the symbol ω represents ordinary frequency (not <b>angular</b> <b>frequency),</b> and {{is expressed in}} units of cm−1. The value is obtained by dividing the frequency by {{the speed of light}} in vacuum. In other words, the frequency in cm−1 units corresponds to the inverse of the wavelength of a photon in vacuum, that has the same frequency as the measured phonon. The cm−1 is a unit of energy used frequently in the dispersion relations of both acoustic and optical phonons, see units of energy for more details and uses.|$|E
25|$|Special {{calibrated}} strobe lights, {{capable of}} flashing up {{to hundreds of}} times per second, are used in industry to stop the appearance of motion of rotating and other repetitively operating machinery and to measure, or adjust, the rotation speeds or cycle times. Since this stop is only apparent, a marked point on the rotating body will either appear to move backward or forward, or not move, depending on {{the frequency of the}} strobe-flash. If the flash occurs equal to the period of rotation (or evenly multiplied, i.e. 2*π*n/ω, where n is an integer and ω the <b>angular</b> <b>frequency)</b> the marked point will appear to not move. Any non integer flash setting will make the mark appear to move forward or backward, e.g. a slight increase of the flash frequency will make the point appear to move backward.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- When {{identifying}} continuous-time {{systems in}} the Laplace domain, it is indispensable to scale the frequency axis to guarantee the numerical stability of the normal equations. Without scaling, identification in the Laplace domain is often impossible even for modest model orders of the transfer function. Although the optimal scaling depends on the system, the model, and the excitation signal, the arithmetic mean of the maximum and minimum <b>angular</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the frequency band of interest is commonly used as a good compromise [1 - 3]. In this paper we show (i) that the optimal frequency scaling also strongly depends on the estimation algorithm, and (ii) that the median of the <b>angular</b> <b>frequencies</b> is a better compromise for improving the numerical stability than the arithmetic mean...|$|R

25|$|Note: <b>angular</b> <b>frequency</b> ω (ω=2 π f) {{with the}} units of radians per second {{is often used}} in {{equations}} because it simplifies the equations, but is normally converted to ordinary frequency (units of Hz or equivalently cycles per second) when stating the frequency of a system. If the mass and stiffness {{of the system is}} known, the formula above can determine the frequency at which the system vibrates once set in motion by an initial disturbance. Every vibrating system has one or more natural frequencies that it vibrates at once disturbed. This simple relation can be used to understand in general what happens to a more complex system once we add mass or stiffness. For example, the above formula explains why, when a car or truck is fully loaded, the suspension feels ″softer″ than unloaded—the mass has increased, reducing the natural frequency of the system.|$|E
