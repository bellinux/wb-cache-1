5|$|In 1991, the Athens Airport {{charged a}} 25% higher landing fee for those {{aircraft}} arriving between 11:00 and 17:00 during the high tourism season during summer. Hong Kong charges an additional flat fee {{to the basic}} weight charge.

For <b>a</b> <b>Boeing</b> 747 the differential was even higher, as the old 747 carries a higher noise charge. Though related to runway congestion, the main objective of these peak charges at the major British airports was to raise revenue for investment.|$|E
