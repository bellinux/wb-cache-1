40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{knowledge}} management activities and practice is {{to enhance the}} ability to utilize the knowledge and experiences that exist embedded in the organization. Knowledge management is absolutely essential {{for the success of}} knowledge intensive project-oriented organizations like construction, and management should arguably put adequate resources in motion to facilitate and foster knowledge utilization on an organizational level. Even so, knowledge utilization has no real value to the organization unless project-participants, who are in need of useful knowledge receive it, accept it, utilize it and also re-apply it. We have investigated four separate subjects relating to these issues and found that all of them provide substantial possibilities for enhancing knowledge utilization in this knowledge intensive context. Leadership behavior, Mentorships, Portal solutions and virtual communication are addressed separately both theoretically and empirically. Measures and actions are presented as recommendations and cover a wide angel of approaches. The recommendation section is related to how a construction firm might improve knowledge- planning, development and sharing of knowledge. Some measures are easy, others could be more challenging to implement. Management is ultimately responsible for deciding upon which measures to take into account and how they should be both prioritized and customized to fit the organization under scrutiny. Issues illuminated through literature do vary from real life experience, and even though most theoretical implications seem rooted in reality they do differentiate. In essence we narrow it down to whether or not knowledge management should be deliberately controlled by management or on the other hand more emergent and culturally handled. By purposely placement of reflection questions throughout the study we try to spark the readers thought processing and reflection, in addition to visualize that there <b>aren</b> <b>t</b> <b>many</b> rights or wrongs when assessing knowledge management. As for the project thesis {{we do not want to}} signal that we propose direct answers to our research question. We discuss the subjects, raise awareness, illuminate knowledge management issues and provide the reader with alternatives and measures based on both literature- and empirical research...|$|R

40|$|Two Gram-positive, non-motile, non-spore-forming, {{strictly}} aerobic, pigmented cocci, strains <b>Ben</b> 107 (<b>T)</b> and <b>Ben</b> 108 (<b>T),</b> {{growing in}} aggregates were isolated from activated sludge samples by micromanipulation. Both possessed the rare type A 3 gamma 2 ̆ 7 peptidoglycan. Major menaquinones of strain <b>Ben</b> 107 (<b>T)</b> were MK- 9 (H- 4) and MK- 7 (H- 2), {{and the main}} cellular fatty acid was 12 -methyltetradecanoic acid (ai-C- 15 : 0). In strain <b>Ben</b> 108 (<b>T),</b> MK- 9 (H- 4), MK- 9 (H- 2) and MK- 7 (H- 4) were the menaquinones and again the main fatty acid was 12 -methyltetradecanoic acid (ai-C- 15 : 0). Polar lipids in both strains consisted of phosphatidyl inositol, phosphatidyl glycerol and diphosphatidyl glycerol with two other unidentified glycolipids and phospholipids also present in both. These data, together with the 16 S rDNA sequence data, suggest that strain <b>Ben</b> 107 (<b>T)</b> belongs to the genus Friedmanniella which presently includes a single recently described species, Friedmanniella antarctica. Although the taxonomic status of strain <b>Ben</b> 108 (<b>T)</b> is far less certain, {{on the basis of}} its 16 S rRNA sequence it is also adjudged to be best placed in the genus Friedmanniella, The chemotaxonomic characteristics and DNA-DNA hybridization data support the view that <b>Ben</b> 107 (<b>T)</b> and <b>Ben</b> 108 (<b>T)</b> are novel species of the genus Friedmanniella. Hence, it is proposed that strain <b>Ben</b> 107 (<b>T)</b> (=ACM 5121 (T)) is named as Friedmanniella spumicola sp. nov. and strain <b>Ben</b> 108 (<b>T)</b> (=ACM 5120 (T)) as Friedmanniella capsulata sp. nov...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} free to read at the publisher's website Three {{isolates}} of gram-negative bacteria, strains <b>Ben</b> 102 <b>T,</b> <b>Ben</b> 103 <b>T,</b> and <b>Ben</b> 104 <b>T,</b> were obtained in pure culture by micromanipulation from activated sludge biomass from wastewater treatment plants in Italy, Australia, and Macau, respectively. These isolates all had a distinctive morphology; the cells were cocci that usually were arranged in tetrads. Based on this criterion, they resembled other bacteria from activated sludge previously called “G” bacteria. On the basis of phenotypic characteristics {{and the results of}} 16 S ribosomal DNA sequence analyses, the three isolates were very similar to each other, but were sufficiently different from their closest phylogenetic relatives (namely, the genera Rhodobacter, Rhodovulum, and Paracoccus in the α subdivision of the Proteobacteria) to be placed in a new genus, Amaricoccus gen. nov. Each of the three isolates represents a new species of the genus Amaricoccuś; strains <b>Ben</b> 102 <b>T,</b> <b>Ben</b> 103 <b>T,</b> and <b>Ben</b> 104 Tare named Amaricoccus veronensis, Amaricoccus tamworthensis, and Amaricoccus macauensis, respectively. An isolate designated <b>Ben</b> 101 <b>T,</b> which was isolated independently by Cech and Hartman in Kaplice, Czech Republic, was also characterized and belongs to the same genus. We propose that the isolate of Cech and Hartman should be placed in another new species, Amaricoccus kaplicensis...|$|R
