Later on, Melges brought out a version of the J-Scow with a larger mainsail and some new designs. The MC-Scow was born.

Johnson and Melges both continued to make MC's until 1998 when Melges bought out Johnson.|$|E

Nevertheless, the resulting models should be consistent with each other because they refer to the same system from different perspectives.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how a company’s ability for continuous improvement is affected by product modularization. Modularization facilitates product improvements defined to a specific module. However, the ability to work with manufacturing improvements becomes more difficult if the modules are manufactured by external suppliers. The improvement work must be transformed and focused on more innovative rather than incremental changes. This is also confirmed by the case study done for this paper at a multinational company relying heavily on external suppliers. In the case study we could also identify how the company handles this situation by using different intermediaries, for instance a design support group, that coordinate designers and suppliers when improvement issues are raised. Designers’ manufacturing competence is essential not only to get <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>design</b> result, <b>but</b> also for designers’ ability to understand improvement issues emanating from customers’ and suppliers’ needs. By dual sourcing the company could differentiate the level of collaboration and get closeness with some suppliers, providing the designers updated manufacturing skills...|$|R
5000|$|Stagger-EZ is {{a unique}} three place pusher canard aircraft, {{featuring}} staggered seating, a dihedral canard, and a rounder fuselage which differs from other canard aircraft in its class (e.g. Cozy MK IV, Velocity, Long-Ez). The aircraft has standard LongEZ wings and a redesigned fuselage. It was designed by a composite craftsman and pilot {{by the name of}} Steve Wright. After completing a VariEZe, Steve Wright found it to be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>design</b> <b>but</b> small and lacking in features he wanted. He flew over a thousand hours in his VariEZe but wanted to build a second canard. He learned that a couple of pilots had suffered broken legs in Long-EZ accidents. So Steve began his design of a new canard that would incorporate several improvements. In 1999 he started by laying a keel {{down the center of the}} composite fuselage, which in turn caused the nose wheel to be moved to the right several inches. That improved legroom for the PIC position on the left. The reduced area on the right floor board did not allow for dual rudder pedals. The rods that control the elevator and aileron where positioned in a center console rather than down each side like a Cozy III. The right seater stick is 13 inches behind the left seater. Thus the right seat is [...] "Staggered" [...] back 13 inches. Lastly, a third seat is in the back behind the left seat. With a 42 inch wide fuselage, Steve ordered a custom canopy be made that is at least 20% larger than a Cozy III. The canopy does not open to the side, but is electric and moves up and back like many jet aircraft. Another major change was made to the landing gear. It was moved out and anchored in the strake area. (Any rocks or debris kicked up by the main landing gear are outside of the propeller arc.) Steve also incorporated a simpler fuel system. A central sump connects both fuel tanks. So the Stagger EZ has only one fuel cap but still holds 43 gallons. The Stagger EZ flew for the first time in 2004. Steve flew the Stagger EZ to EAA's [...] "Sun-N-Fun" [...] Fly-In and received [...] "Grand Champion" [...] in the home built category in 2005. Steve and Patricia Wright flew the Stagger EZ until 2009 when Steve came down with cancer. Steve died from melanoma cancer in May 2010. David Williford purchased the StaggerEZ in May 2011. He flew it for 50 hours before having to ground it for a major restoration which lasted almost two years. The Stagger EZ still flies today because of both Steve Wright and David Williford.

This {{has led to}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>design</b> <b>but</b> with contentious features. This chapter highlights the conflict between principles and features, particularly in the social context in which ded was designed. The primary intent of this chapter is to present the context and design decisions lying behind a particular interactive system. Neither the design itself nor its description here has been directly influenced by the book's framework; it seems more honest that way. However, the following salient points may be noted:. Science is considered {{as a form of}} explicit, public knowledge. The public (i. e., user) accessibility of explanation of ded was a criterion of satisfactory design. As designers we also explained ded to ourselves by way of principles; thus, the role of principles was paramount, as we hope will be made clear in this chapter...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{evaluation}} of new communication protocols for Vehic-ular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) {{is a hot}} topic in research. An effi-cient design and actual deployment of such software tools is crucial for any VANET. The design phase is difficult and often relies on computer simulation. The later {{evaluation of}} protocols in real VANETs is complex due to many difficulties concerning the availability of resources, accurate performance analysis, and reproducible results. Simulation is the most widely solution to make <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>design</b> <b>but</b> it presents also an important challenge: the fidelity of the simulation compared to the real results. In this article we measure {{the differences between the}} simulation versus the real results with actual moving cars in order to quantify the accuracy of the VANET simulations inside the European CARLINK Project 1. After a thorough revision {{of the state of the}} art, we here go for an analysis of JANE and VanetMobiSim/ns- 2, two simulation frameworks. Later, we have defined the scenario where both, simulations and real tests, will be carried out. Our results show that JANE is more appropriate for simulating applications, while ns- 2 is more accurate in dealing with the underlying mobile communication network...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} {{for the use of}} Axiomatic Design Theory in combination with agile project management methods like Scrum for an effective, structured and combined product design and development process. Agile project management methods give a guideline how to manage a project, but there is only minor assistance regarding the actual product development process itself. Axiomatic Design can be used to support these methods in this point. In concrete terms, the results of the decomposition process of this theory can be used to formulate and structure the work packages for the agile project managing process. The Independence Axiom of Axiomatic Design Theory has a substantial contribution by ensuring the independence of the work packages which can be assigned to different project team members and can be processed independently by them. The combination of the different methods not only helps to ensure <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>design</b> solution <b>but</b> also helps to work more agile within a project team. The here proposed approach is one part of a holistic product design and development process for changeable production units – called Adapt! – and is described within a use case in the automotive sector...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary seismic {{design of}} steel braced systems {{is based on}} dissipating {{earthquake}} energy through significant inelastic deformation in the bracing members under cyclic excursions. The structure is designed such that the first significant yield occurs at ground intensity levels that are {{at or above the}} design earthquake forces. Thus, delaying the yielding of brace elements is deemed <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>design</b> <b>but</b> it could also lead to subsequent loss of stiffness and strength, large residual deformation or even dynamic instability and collapse. To enhance the post-yield performance of the brace system, a steel component with high strain hardening character may be required. The stress-strain behaviour of structural stainless steel, the austenitic 304 L type, shows an early deviation from linearity at a much lower stress level than carbon steels, but with a much stronger strain hardening character. In this study, the austenitic 304 L stainless steel material is characterised under large inelastic cyclic strains. Coupons were carefully designed and machined from 304 L stainless steel and 350 WT carbon steel plates, and were tested under constant cyclic strain amplitudes. Results of these tests have shown that 304 L stainless steel exhibits greater cyclic hardening with maximum cyclic stress values up to nearly three times the yield stress. However, the carbon steel showed greater low-cycle fatigue life...|$|E
40|$|Residential yards are {{important}} {{as they are}} a part of the everyday landscape for most people living in urban areas. Vegetation is one important component of the yards. The aim of this report is to suggest a way of systemizing the way vegetation on residential yards is being planned, maintained and renewed. The most common perspectives on plant use are plant ecology or an aesthetic perspective, focusing on either habitat or on colours, textures and other architectural values. In this report we introduce a third concept: plant technology in which we emphasize sustainable plant design: design for fairly easy maintenance, and design that can last over time. With the concept of plant technology we have aimed to include aspects of plant use that are easy to understand by a layman. It contains aspects of plant use that are related to the context where the plant is used. It concerns basic, but never the less, important aspects, like: if the plant will grow larger than what is suited for the design; if it will cover the ground to reduce weeds; if leaves, thorns or root sprouts will cause inconveniencies; if the design will cause unnecessary maintenance problems. Obviously, using the concept of plant technology is not a strategy to reach <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>design,</b> <b>but</b> rather to avoid a bad design. In this report we suggest a guide to detect problems related to plant technology in residential yards in south Sweden. The guide can be extended and adapted to be useful in other types of areas, like parks, cemeteries and other types of technical infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|Background Over {{the past}} decades a {{considerable}} number of studies have been done on the golden ratio and the relation between their aesthetics and design. These studies, after analyzing design icons with the golden ratio, seem to prove that the golden ratio is an important principle for good design. However, these studies mainly focused on western products that were used in western countries. And thus, the majority of the products were designed by western designers and analyzed by western scholars. These factors raised a doubt whether the golden ratio is also the most aesthetically pleasing proportion in other countries, for example in Asia. Proportions are determined by mathematical logic; however preference and aesthetic judgment are aroused from individual's experience and environmental context. Questioning whether the golden ratio is the most commonly preferred proportion across cultures led to an empirical study to examine the differences between Western and Asian preferences on the golden ratio. Specifically, this study is focused on Koreans' preference and their traditional products. Methods First, the preference experiment on proportion was conducted in South Korea with 277 subjects. Second, this study continued to analyze the proportion of over 100 Korean traditional objects that exemplify the research results. Results The experimental data clearly reveals that Korean subjects have a significant preference for the root ratio (1 : 1. 414). This result obviously contradicts previous studies conducted in western countries that showed a strong preference for the golden ratio, and their good design objects are also characterized by the golden ratio (1 : 1. 618). This study continues to verify that Koreans' favorite ratio could be found in Korean traditional design objects reflecting their preference. Korean traditional design objects show a clearly shorter ratio (1 : 1, 1 : 1. 333) than the golden ratio (1 : 1. 618). Conclusions It is concluded that the golden ratio is not always the best proportion for <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>design,</b> <b>but</b> it may be a preferred proportion since this ratio can be found in everyday objects as one of the predominant design features. Specifically, this finding will evoke deeper insights in the correlation of an influential impact between aesthetic preference and the element of design form and shape.

40|$|A lunar outpost {{will have}} need for deep {{drilling}} operations for both explorative and practical purposes. As in any drilling operation, the cuttings must be cleared from the hole. The hard vacuum of the lunar environment renders conventional flushing methods of cutting removal unfeasible, and requires {{a new system of}} removal. A rotary stepped auger (RSA) is a simple mechanical method of removing dry cuttings from a deep hole, and is ideally suited to the lunar environment. The RSA consists of a helical auger with stepped ramps which allow cuttings to slide up the helix, but will prevent them from sliding back down. The auger is driven in a pulsed manner by applying a periodic function of acceleration to the auger shaft. These pulses will compel the cuttings to slide up the auger's helix while the stepped ramps prevent the cuttings from backsliding while the auger accelerates. A mathematical model of the RSA was developed and experimentally evaluated. The math model produced <b>a</b> <b>good</b> baseline <b>design,</b> <b>but</b> the experimental model required some tuning to account for the approximations made in the math model. This design is suited for lunar drilling because it is mechanically simple, integral to the drill string, requires no fluids, is suited to the dry soil, and has relatively low weight and power requirements...|$|R

The FC188Bs were another update of the 1987 car, but {{were hard to}} handle, and about 20 km/h slower {{than the rest of}} the grid. Nevertheless, both drivers were able to qualify for the Monaco Grand Prix. This was the only race participation of a Coloni in the first part of the season. In Canada, Coloni presented a new car (the Coloni C3) which was penned by former AGS man Christian Vanderpleyn. The C3 was <b>a</b> basically <b>good</b> <b>design</b> <b>but</b> the team suffered again from a complete lack of testing. This meant that the team often failed to find the right set up for the races. The team failed to qualify for most of the rest of the season — only in three cases, the debut of the Coloni C3, the 1989 Canadian Grand Prix, the 1989 British Grand Prix and at the Portuguese Grand Prix did Moreno qualify, in 26th, 23rd and 15th place respectively, after a developmental front wing was fitted for Estoril. Unfortunately for the team, he then collided with Eddie Cheever in the warm-up http://www.f1rejects.com/teams/coloni/large/89-f1-estoril-rm-1.jpg and had to use the spare car. He did not finish the race as the engine blew up after a handful of laps. As results failed to arrive, the team was cut back throughout the year. After Vanderpleyn had left the team in September, Enzo Coloni took over the engineer's job himself but unsurprisingly this brought no improvement. Neither did the new driver Enrico Bertaggia who replaced Raphanel for the last races. The team finished equal 18th and last with Zakspeed, because the EuroBrun team never qualified that year. The Portuguese Grand Prix proved to be the last qualification for a Coloni car.|$|R
40|$|Experience {{economy is}} {{prompting}} the innovation of traditional product design. The design concept - "user-centered design" has received wide recognition. In {{the face of}} many professional or non-professional users, the priority of interaction design is to ensure the usability of the interactive product, and then <b>a</b> <b>good</b> user experience of the product. The user interface is an intermediary between human and computer. Users exchange information with the computer via the user interface. The user interface {{is an important part}} of a computer system. It is a big part of the software development. The quality of the user interface directly affects the performance of the software.

In this project we investigate different ways of recording design decisions in interactive system development which may allow us to think of the different variants and alternatives that are possible (within a design space) in some formal notation, which then allows us to either reason about their suitability or record the decisions made to understand the impact of decisions and how well they support the given criteria. The goal of this project will involve finding out what the influences are which help drive the design process; considering the effects of individual vs. team design; deciding how and when decisions occur; thinking about useful ways to record decisions and their influences; and investigating the usefulness of the approach through the working examples identified as case studie...|$|R
40|$|Airplane-Pilot Coupling (APC) is {{the current}} {{denomination}} of unwanted dynamic couplings between the airplane an pilot that can occur in specific circunstance, leading to instability an otherwise stable system. APC events can be non-oscillatory but the most common are oscillatory, commonly called Pilot-Involved Oscillations (PIO). Most of the previous and on going researches have tried to understand, predict and avoid APC events. Understanding is based in many studies that include analyses of real cases of APC, interpretation of pilot plus airplane as a closed-loop system and classification of APC events according to characteristics like degree of nonlinearity or frequency and amplitude of the oscillations. Prediction is based in analytical criteria; {{many of them are}} currently under development. Such criteria are intended to be applied during airplane design in order to decide whether determined configuration is (or is not) susceptible to APC events. Avoidance is based in the combination of concepts resulting from correct understanding of the APC phenomenon with application of appropriated prediction criteria. This combination should make it possible to develop <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>design.</b> <b>But</b> this is not sufficient to guarantee a very low possibility of an APC event occur during the airplane operacional life. Therefore, to complement the avoidance process it is necessary to plan and to perform a specific flight test program. This text is an effort that attempts to cover the most import APC related points, named undestanding, prediction and avoidance. However, the focus of the present text is in the third point. More specifically, the main goal of text is to propose a methodology - including specialized maneuvers - to conduct a flight test program dedicated to APC. This is done in a way that a methodology constituted by three phases is proposed. In the first phase only low bandwidth handling qualities* at safe concitions, are tested. This phase can be understood as a "familiarization" testing. In the second phase the high bandwidth handling qualities* are tested, always using tracking manueuvers, that require the evaluation pilot to drive the airplane to track an specific signal as aggressively and assiduously as possible. In the third phase pilots must conduct evaluation of the airplane handling qualities during situations. Complementing the maneuvers performed during the flight test program above mentioned, it is necessary to apply suitable tools in order to "measure" the APC susceptibility of the tested airplane. In this text the current main tools are described. They are basically pilot comments, rating scales (that are based pilot opinion) and frequency domain data analyses (that are based in the obtainment of the frequency response from test data) ...|$|E

The evaluation of uncertainty of the surveyed data is not trivial because the final accuracy of the point position is unknown. An a priori evaluation of {{the accuracy of the}} observed points can be made based on both the footprint size and of the resolution, as well as in terms of effective instantaneous field of view (EIFOV). Such evaluations are surely helpful for <b>a</b> <b>good</b> survey <b>design,</b> <b>but</b> the further operations, such as cloud co-registration, georeferencing and editing, digital elevation model (DEM) creation, and so on, cause uncertainty which is difficult to evaluate. An assessment {{of the quality of the}} survey can be made evaluating the goodness of fit between the georeferenced point cloud and the terrain model built using it. In this article, we have considered a typical survey of a landsliding slope. We have presented an a priori quantitative assessment and we eventually analyzed how good the comparison is of the computed point cloud to the actual ground points. We have used the method of cross-validation to eventually suggest the use of a robust parameter for estimating the reliability of the fitting procedure. This statistic can be considered for comparing methods and parameters used to interpolate the DEM. Using kriging allows one to account for the spatial distribution of the data (including the typical anisotropy of the survey of a slope) and to obtain a map of the uncertainties over the height of the grid nodes. This map can be used to compute the estimated error over the DEM-derived quantities, and also represents an "objective" definition of the area of the survey that can be trusted for further use...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{is aimed at}} studying and identifying the different processes {{for the development of}} disadvantaged areas, in terms of economy and production and due to distance from the major centers of development, starting with the introduction of new concepts and integrated visions. The result of this {{research is}} the definition of a reading methodology of the territory that can identify the future vision aims to creative local development. The territory policies, derived from the identification of local potentiality and their correct use, allows growth focused on solid and lasting actions. Sustainable development is an endogenous process which depends on the ability of the territory to transform a burst of growth in concrete actions to achieve it. In this context, it is possible to combine the intangible resources, such as governance, culture and social organization, to facilitate the emergence of agreements between the actors involved and to obtain legitimacy and acknowledgement of these processes. Ladder of this analysis is the urban dimension where are concentrate the majority of social problems and the opportunities to resolve them. Indeed the research is addressed to those cities that have the ability to create the conditions of government, technology and infrastructure needed to produce social innovation and to solve problems related to growth, integration and quality of life through processes of inclusion and awareness of the different actors: citizens, businesses and associations. These cities are considered smart cities. The current crisis is not only limited to the happening processes but it also refers to the models and methodologies apply until nowadays. However, currently there is a growing movement that argues that the city can be intelligent in a different way: by investing in innovation. The innovation is normally associated with the creation of sophisticated processes, but is also represented by the simple process improvement in order to achieve results in less time, with higher quality, lower cost and so on. To achieve innovation (social and urban) that is relied by this movement the basis must be the "creativity". In this context, "creativity and innovation" are presented as possible solutions to the need widely recognized of a paradigm shift for the territories. Creativity is the ability and opportunity to test innovative tools that allow to create development processes; Innovation is defined as the consciousness and the ability to realize the ideas, leading them to material achievements; Social Innovation is aimed at promoting an integrated society and processes of collective intelligence, Territorial Intelligence is aimed at transform the individuals intelligence and skills into collectives expertise for the integration of new practices to support the development; finally the Creative City is the scale of intervention and the new paradigm for development, to built a future vision and apply innovative tools in the planning process of the city starting from urban creativity. Being creative develop is not just making <b>a</b> <b>good</b> architectural <b>design</b> <b>but</b> it means finding a new way to solve a problem, regardless of its nature. However, not all territories are prepared to deal with the processes of openness and change, or to assume these new paradigms. An example is represented by Latin American cities, where local and regional authorities are called (and almost mandatory) to face new challenges, including the creation or strengthening their ability to compete and to transform the local production systems. These two aspects must be connected to the local policies. The proposal for a methodology of reading the territory arise from the need to determine how creativity, innovation and territorial policies can be integrated in a positive way towards the definition of strategies that stimulate positive processes in the cities and that will lead not only to economic growth but also to an environmental quality of life increase for the entire community. The definition of such strategies must be based on the construction of a vision for the territories that {{can be used as a}} guideline for the future. Innovation, city, creativity, society, community, development, sustainability, intelligence are all concepts that interact, generating new fields of action and leading to recognize the need to rethink, re-think of the city as an environment for primordial development of man, re-thinking development, its consequences and its feasibility, and especially re-think society, community and the relationships that are generated...|$|R
