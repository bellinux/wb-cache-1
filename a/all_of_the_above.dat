5|$|A 2003 {{attempt by}} Christopher Brochu {{included}} Albertosaurus, Alectrosaurus, Alioramus, Daspletosaurus, Gorgosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus in the definition. Holtz redefined the clade in 2004 to use <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>above</b> as specifiers except for Alioramus and Alectrosaurus, which his analysis could not place with certainty. However, {{in the same}} paper, Holtz also provided a completely different definition, including all theropods {{more closely related to}} Tyrannosaurus than to Eotyrannus. The most recent definition is that of Sereno in 2005, which defined Tyrannosauridae as the least inclusive clade containing Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and Tyrannosaurus.|$|E

The disc contains audio commentaries on all six episodes; Nicola Walker, Martin Ball, Geraldine Fitzgerald and John Grillo commentate over four of the episodes, with David Bamber and Amanda Boxer contributing to the remaining two. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>above,</b> along with producer Andre Ptaszynski, also feature in a 45-minute retrospective documentary, After the Chalk Dust Settled.|$|E
5|$|These plugins {{are usually}} easy {{to install and}} can change almost {{everything}} in the game. Plugins can include new creatures, weapons, armor, quests, people, playable species, Easter eggs, stores, player-owned houses, cities, expand {{on the size of}} cities, and introduce new plotlines, and entire landmasses with some or <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>above.</b> Organized projects, such as Tamriel Rebuilt and , attempt to recreate the originally envisioned Morrowind province and other parties of Tamriel, as seen in other The Elder Scrolls games. For example, there are interpretations of both Cyrodiil and Skyrim, the settings of later The Elder Scrolls games.|$|E

5|$|In 1876 the {{zoologist}} Joel Asaph Allen {{discovered the}} remains of Canis mississippiensis (Allen 1876) and associated these with C.dirus (Leidy 1858) and Canis indianensis (Leidy 1869). As so little was found of these three specimens, Allen thought it best to leave each specimen listed under its provisional name until more material could be found to reveal their relationship. In 1908 the paleontologist John Campbell Merriam began retrieving numerous fossilized bone fragments of a large wolf from the Rancho LaBrea tar pits. By 1912 {{he had found a}} skeleton sufficiently complete to be able to formally recognize these and the previously found specimens under the name C.dirus (Leidy 1858). Because the rules of nomenclature stipulated that the name of a species should be the oldest name ever applied to it, Merriam therefore selected the name of Leidy's 1858 specimen, C.dirus. In 1915 the paleontologist Edward Troxell indicated his agreement with Merriam when he declared C.indianensis a synonym of C.dirus. In 1918, after studying these fossils, Merriam proposed consolidating their names under the separate genus Aenocyon (from Aenos, terrible and cyon, wolf) to become Aenocyon dirus, but not everyone agreed with this extinct wolf being placed in a new genus separate from the genus Canis. Canis ayersi (Sellards 1916) and Aenocyon dirus (Merriam 1918) were recognized as synonyms of C.dirus by the paleontologist Ernest Lundelius in 1972. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>above</b> taxa were declared synonyms of C.dirus in 1979, according to the paleontologist Ronald M. Nowak.|$|E
