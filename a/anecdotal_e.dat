40|$|At {{least five}} {{dimensionless}} variables {{are needed for}} dimensional analysis of an individual surface-deposit feeder using particles containing microbial food both locally produced (by in situ growth) and advected (via sediment transport). From scaling arguments which provide the relationships among these variables, {{it is apparent that}} food availability is determined primarily by the ratios of geophysical sediment transport rate into the particle pool from which the animal feeds to its ingestion rate, and of particle residence time in the feeding pool to the microbial doubling time, Increasing sediment transport can either increase or decrease local food availability. Transport patterns beneath waves have dramatic effects: wave mixing makes available to the animal particles which otherwise would be literally out of reach. Specialization on advected particles and reliance on microbial gardening are favored under different environmental conditions, specified in terms of dimensionless ratios. The scaling model also places previous models of deposit feeding in an environmental context. It contrasts with an alternative, nutrient spiraling approach in having a basis in natural selection for its optimization arguments. Much of the evidence for the importance of sediment transport in providing nutrition to deposit feeders remains <b>anecdotal</b> (<b>e.</b> g. Nowell et al. 1984). The relative importance of such transport vs. local microbial growth in the diet remains an open question, and the answer is likely to vary among environ-ments and among species. As a first step in approaching a quantitative answer, we re-sorted to dimensional analysis, a technique used frequently in engineering and physic...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{development}} of the Chinese Drug Involvement Scale for use in Chinese commu-nities. Method: A battery of scales, including the Chinese Drug Involvement Scale and three mental health measures, were administered to 152 students of 13 to 18 years of age. Reliability and validity analyses were performed. The refined version was then cross-validated {{on a group of}} identified drug abusers (N = 77). Results: The final version of the Chinese Drug Involvement Scale is a 22 -item scale. Validation results demonstrate that theChineseDrug Involvement Scale has high reliability and a satisfactory level of validity. Conclusion: The Chinese Drug Involve-ment Scale is a global assessment of an individual’s beliefs and values relating to drug use, apart from actual drug abuse behavior. The scale will be particularly useful for periodic assessments or outcome evaluation in treatment programs. In Hong Kong, an upward trend in adolescent drug abuse has been detected since the early 1990 s, particularly in the abuse of heroin and psychotropic substances among students (Narcotics Division, 1997, 2000 a), triggering a growing concern over the prevalence of drug abuse amongHongKong youth. Although the government has stipulated a focus on youth in its antidrugwork (Narcotics Division, 2000 b), with a few exceptions (e. g., Shek, 1998), stud-ies on young drug abusers in the past decade have been mainly descriptive and <b>anecdotal</b> (<b>e.</b> g., HongKongCouncil of Social Service, 1998; HongKong Council of Social Service & Hong Kong Playground Association, 1995). This article reports the development and validation of an assessment tool that will help practitioners evaluate the significance of a client’s drug abuse prob-lem beyond mere drug consumption. Further, as only 20 % of drug abuser...|$|E
40|$|Three {{samples from}} a major U. S. {{metropolitan}} area are used within a quasi-experimental design to study individuals who contributed money to the far right campaign of David Duke to become Governor of Louisiana in 1991. Using mail survey and Census data, contributors are compared both with their near neighbors and with a probability sample of the predominantly white portions of the metropolitan area. The Duke contributors are spread in {{what appears to be}} a nearly random way over the white urban and suburban towns and townships, rather than being clustered together or located in a few subculturally distinct places. Those who responded to our questionnaire—a re-markably high 86 percent of the target contributor sample—are also similar demo-graphically to their neighbors and to the white cross-section, except for being older and more often male. In political and social attitudes and values, the Duke contributors are strikingly different from the other two samples in most, though not quite all, respects, but their near neighbors are indistinguishable from the general white population. The Oklahoma City bombing in the USA has been widely viewed as influenced by a larger right wing antipathy toward the federal government and those seen as controlling it (The Economist, April 29, 1995, pp. 30 - 1). Much of the knowledge of this evolving hostility is necessarily qualitative and <b>anecdotal</b> (<b>e.</b> g. Ezekiel 1995), because those holding extreme views are ordinarily too few to show up clearly in cross-section sample surveys. We were able in a 1992 mail survey to focus closely and quantitatively on one recent manifestation of far right ressentiment, and to do so by starting from a simple behavior that allowed identification of the allegiance of potential respondents before surveying them. The putative right wing sample consisted of financial contributors from out of state to the efforts by David Duke—a former American Nazi and Ku Klux Klan activist—to win the governorship of the state of Louisiana in 1991. For a time there seemed a real possibility of Duke winning the race for governor...|$|E

Although three software tools were employed (CellDesigner™, MATLAB™ including the Parallel Computing Toolbox, and Nimrod), this paper reports {{on the use of}} CellDesigner in teaching computational thinking and modeling, including system dynamics and regulatory networks. Each session included a series of brief orientations to the tool, followed with illustrative, practical projects for participants to implement. From written evaluations and various forms of <b>anecdotal</b> evidence (<b>e.</b> g., oral communications, participation, project/assignment performance), we conclude CellDesigner to be a suitable tool for use in such a workshop...|$|R
40|$|The {{anterior}} median (AM) or principal eyes of {{the primitive}} jumping spider, Portia fimbriata (Doleschall), are miniature telephoto systems (Williams & Mclntyre, 1980). Another study on the AM eyes of Plexippus suggests that most salticid principal eyes may be of similar design (Blest, Hardie, Mclntyre and Williams, 1982). Both studies assumed, from <b>anecdotal</b> evidence (<b>e.</b> g. Forster, 1979), that jumping spiders can make visual discriminations between prey and mates at distances of ca. 20 cm. This estimate is necessary to the functional analyses that were essayed; because {{it is impossible to}} make sufficiently accurate direct measurements of some of the para-meters of these small eyes, their optics can only be modelled with confidence when something is known about what they are designed to see. Land (1969 a, b), in an elegant optical study, followed Drees (1952) in stating that jumping spiders respond to significant objects some 5 - 10 body-lengths in front of them. In the case of Portia, this would be a distance of no more than 10 cm at most. Recognition of objects is mediated through the AM eyes (Drees, 1952). Portia allows particularly satisfactory assessment of the distances at which visua...|$|R
40|$|Design Thinking is a human-centred {{methodology}} for innovation, which {{has evolved from}} the study of the unique ways in which designers 'think', and 'practice' (Bauer & Eagen, 2008). While there is emerging research into the learning and teaching of Design Thinking, it is often <b>anecdotal,</b> i. <b>e.</b> reflection rather than research-based, and there is general lack of rigorous evaluation of curricula. This paper presents a PhD research project that explores how Design Thinking expertise can be best introduced, developed, and nurtured within Product Design and Business higher education programmes. The project involves the development, evaluation and refinement of a Design Thinking curriculum, including the design of learning outcomes, content, learning activities, assessment, and resources. The evaluation focuses on the students' learning experience, and their development of Design Thinking expertise. Participants also contribute to the further development of the curriculum. The research uses Action Research, Design and Co-Design methodologies, with embedded Case Studies, and draws upon both qualitative and quantitative methods. A number of key theories and constructs inform the curriculum design, in particular Design Thinking (Brown, 2008), Constructivism (Cross, 2011), Experiential Learning (Kolb, 1984), and Bloom's Learning Domains (Bloom, 1965) ...|$|R
40|$|Academics {{often have}} a “gut feeling” about which {{categories}} of students are successful or unsuccessful on their courses. Sometimes {{this is based on}} ad hoc <b>anecdotal</b> evidence, <b>e.</b> g. citing examples of a few strong or weak students, or sometimes based on back of the envelope analyses. It is not unusual to hear staff hypothesise that mature students do better/worse than 18 year olds or National Diploma entry students do better or worse than “A” level entry students. However, staff experiences with subgroups of students can be misleading and not representative of the true picture of the student cohort as a whole. This project adopted a systematic approach to identify the characteristics of successful (awarded 1 st or 2 (i)) and unsuccessful (e. g. fail or withdrawn) types of students on a suite of Music Technology and Production degrees. It extracted data from the University’s Applicant and Student Information System and compared student’s entry profiles with the outcome of their studies. Whilst the results are arguably specific to these particular Music Technology/Production courses, some interesting results were produced. For example, increasing UCAS points increased the percentage of successful students but it did not decrease the percentage of unsuccessful students as might have been expected...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis short review {{focuses on}} the {{findings}} associated with a long-term field study on two species of sea kraits in New Caledonia. Since 2002, more than 30 sites in the lagoon have been sampled, and in most places mark-recapture was implemented. We collected detailed data on more than 14, 000 marked individuals (> 6000 recaptures) and used different techniques (stable isotopes, bio-logging, analyses of diet). The objective was fundamental: to examine how amphibious snakes cope with both terrestrial and aquatic environments. As access to abundant food is likely the main evolutionary driver for the return transition toward the sea in marine tetrapods, foraging ecology was {{an important part of}} the research and novel information was obtained on this subject. Rapidly however, field observations revealed the potential interest of sea kraits for conservation issues. Our results show that these snakes are useful bio-indicators of marine biodiversity; they also provide a useful signal to monitor levels of contamination by heavy metals in the lagoon, and more generally as a means of studying the functioning of reef ecosystems. Importantly, <b>anecdotal</b> observations (<b>e.</b> g., a krait drinking during rain) provided unsuspected physiological insights of general importance to fundamental problems and conservation. One of the lessons of this long-term study is that key results emerged in an unexpected way, but all were dependent on intensive field work...|$|R
40|$|Studies of raptors 2 ̆ 7 diet are {{important}} for understanding the ecological relationships of the raptors themselves, {{as well as for}} assessing the influence of these predators on community ecology (Marti et al. 2007). Although there is abundant information about food habits of raptor species around the world, data on the trophic ecology of neotropical raptors are scarce and the diets of many species are poorly known (del Hoyo et al. 1994, Bierregaard 1998, Bó et al. 2007). The Roadside Hawk (Buteo magnirostris) is a widespread raptor species of Central and South America, ranging from northern Mexico to Río Negro Valley in central Argentina (Thiollay 1994). This medium-sized raptor usually inhabits woodlands and forest edges and, to a lesser extent, open fields near woodlands (Canevari et al. 1991). Near the southern boundary of its range, in the pampas of Buenos Aires Province (Argentina), this raptor is also associated with agroecosystems and grasslands (Narosky and Di Giacomo 1993, Mazar-Barnett and Pearman 2001). Despite being a common species with broad distribution, the Roadside Hawk has been little studied and information about its food habits is scarce and mostly limited to qualitative and <b>anecdotal</b> information (<b>e.</b> g., Haverschmidt 1962, Massoia 1988). In two studies, the diet of Roadside Hawks was quantitatively analyzed. Panasci and Whitacre (2000) reported breeding-season diet in Guatemala through direct observation of nests, and found that the Roadside Hawk delivered mainly small vertebrates (. 90...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Human {{ehrlichiosis}} is due {{to infection}} by tick transmitted bacteria of the genus Ehrlichia. Based on a hypothesis for the biogeography of deer tick transmitted infections, we undertook a focused search for the Eurasian E. muris in North American deer ticks. The search was stimulated by <b>anecdotal</b> reports of <b>E.</b> muris-like infection in human ehrlichiosis patients from Wisconsin. We analyzed archived adult deer ticks collected in northern Wisconsin during the 1990 s by specific polymerase chain reaction for evidence of infection, and sequenced amplification products to identify E. muris. About 1 % of 760 adult deer ticks collected from Spooner, Wisconsin in the 1990 s contained E. muris DNA. We conclude that E. muris was present in North American deer ticks a decade ago {{and is likely to}} infect this human biting vector elsewhere in the U. S. Biogeographic theory and molecular phylogenetic methods can facilitate a targeted search for potential zoonoses.

40|$|Environmental surveys on soil viruses {{are still}} rare and mostly <b>anecdotal,</b> i. <b>e.,</b> they mostly report on viruses at one {{location}} or {{for only a}} few sampling dates. Detailed time-series analysis with multiple samples can reveal the spatio-temporal dynamics of viral communities and provide important input as to how viruses interact with their potential hosts and the environment. Such surveys, however, require fast, easy-to-apply and reliable methods. In the present study we surveyed monthly across 13 months the abundance of virus-like particles (VLP) and the structure of the viral communities in soils along a land use transect (i. e., forest, pasture, and cropland). We evaluated 32 procedures to extract VLP from soil using different buffers and mechanical methods. The most efficient extraction was achieved with 1 × saline magnesium buffer in combination with 20 min vortexing. For community structure analysis we developed an optimized fingerprinting approach (fluorescent RAPD-PCR; fRAPD) by combining RAPD-PCR with fluorescently labeled primers in order to size the obtained fragments on a capillary sequencing machine. With the concomitantly collected data of soil specific factors and weather data, we were able to find correlations of viral abundance and community structure with environmental variables and sampling site. More specifically, we found that soil specific factors such as pH and total nitrogen content {{played a significant role in}} shaping both soil viral abundance and community structure. The fRAPD analysis revealed high temporal changes and clustered the viral communities according to sampling sites. In particular we observed that temperature and rainfall shaped soil viral communities in non-forest sites. In summary our findings suggest that sampling site was a key factor for shaping the abundance and community structure of soil viruses, and when site vegetation was reduced, temperature and rainfall were also important factors...|$|R
40|$|Child {{sexual abuse}} (CSA), a social problem of endemic proportions, has existed in all {{historical}} eras and societies (Conte 1994; Fergusson and Mullen 1999; Wekerle and Wolfe 1996; Wolfe 1999). Since antiquity, <b>anecdotal</b> records (<b>e.</b> g., legal, artistic, philosophical, and literary accounts) have documented activities that would today {{be classified as}} CSA (deMause 1974; Kahr 1991; Olafson, Corwin, and Summit 1993). For instance, a sizable portion of adults in ancient Greek and Roman cultures openly engaged {{in what is now}} considered pederasty or rape (deMause 1974; Kahr 1991). Although adult-child sexual encounters have occurred throughout history, perceptions of such practices have fluctuated, ranging from societal acceptance (adult-child sex viewed as healthy or justifiable) to rejection (adult-child sex believed to be inappropriate or abusive) (Barnett, Miller-Perrin, and Perrin 1997; Kahr 1991; Olafson et al. 1993). With this oscillation of cultural ideologies, establishing behaviors as sexually abusive has not been an additive or linear process. Rather, scholars have called attention to cycles of “recognition (or ‘discovery’) and suppression” that, until the 1970 s, largely obscured public awareness of the magnitude of the problem (Conte 1994; Olafson et al. 1993). In {{the late nineteenth and early}} to mid-twentieth centuries, for example, physicians (e. g., Tardieu), psychoanalysts (e. g., Freud), and researchers (e. g., Kinsey) had, to some extent, dis covered and documented sexual victimization in their patients. Representative of the general sentiment at the time, however, these findings were subsequently minimized, discounted, or justified, resulting in victim blame and a cycle of “suppression” (Bolen 2001; Conte 1994; Olafson et al. 1993). Sigmund Freud’s work perhaps best exemplifies the “recognition and suppression” cycle (Fergusson and Mullen 1999). Specifically, although Freud initially publicized the reality of CSA with his “seduction theory,” he later rescinded this account, indicating that most of the alleged instances were false and that children, via the Oedipal complex, exhibit a natural and erotic sexual desire toward their opposite-sex parent (Bolen 2001; Olafson et al. 1993; Tharinger 1990). In one explanation of Freud’s “suppression,” Bolen (2001) highlighted the Victorian social and political atmosphere which encased Freud and concluded that he “effectively colluded with a society that wished to deny the existence of child sexual abuse” (p. 20) ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Domperidone {{is often}} used to promote {{lactation}} among women who have difficulty breastfeeding. OBJECTIVE: To examine prescribing and dispensing practices of domperidone at the Women's and Children's Hospital (WCH), Adelaide. METHODS: A retrospective audit of domperidone dispensing among women with singleton pregnancies who delivered at the WCH between January 2000 and July 2010 was undertaken. Women dispensed domperidone were identified using WCH pharmacy dispensing records. Maternal and infant clinical data were obtained from the WCH Perinatal Statistics Collection. An audit of paper-based medical records was undertaken for a random sample of 261 mother-child pairs to collect prescribing and additional clinical data. RESULTS: From 2000 to 2010, 1605 women were dispensed domperidone. There was a steady increase in the percentage of women dispensed domperidone, from 5 % of total WCH pregnancies in 2010. Among women dispensed domperidone, the percentage of women who received > 1 dispensing remained consistent (20 %) over time, as did the median number of days (12) from delivery to first dispensing. Multiparous women were more likely to receive domperidone within 3 days following delivery compared to primiparous women (8 % vs 4 %; P <. 01). Most women (80 %) received directions to take domperidone according to a standard tapering dosing regimen over 12 days. Notably, 60 % of women had no documentation of being assessed by a lactation consultant. CONCLUSION: From 2000 to 2010, there was a considerable increase in domperidone dispensing. With a lack of clinical evidence to guide use, current practice appears to be based on <b>anecdotal</b> evidence. Luke <b>E.</b> Grzeskowiak, Sze Wen Lim, Alicia E. Thomas, Usha Ritchie and Andrea L.
