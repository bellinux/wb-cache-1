5|$|No-one had {{questioned}} Calvert's conformity at the time, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been secretly Catholic, he {{had hidden}} it well. It seems more likely Calvert converted in late 1624. At the time, Simon Stock, a Discalced Carmelite priest {{reported to the}} Congregation Propaganda Fide in Rome on 15 November that he had converted two Privy Councillors to Catholicism, one of whom historians are certain was Calvert. Calvert, who had probably met Stock at the Spanish embassy in London, later worked with the priest on {{a plan for a}} Catholic mission in his new first Newfoundland Colony (off modern Canada).|$|E
5|$|The 2012 NHL Entry Draft {{was held}} on June 22–23, 2012, at the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In the first round, the Canucks drafted Brendan Gaunce, a two-way centre with size. Leading up to the draft, Gaunce was ranked 13th among North American skaters by the NHL's {{scouting}} department, and was the top-ranked Canadian forward. Projected to be a mid-first round pick, he dipped slightly to 26 where he was selected by the Canucks. General Manager Mike Gillis stated that going into the draft, they had targeted Gaunce, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not been available, Vancouver would have traded down to add extra picks.|$|E
5|$|But suddenly, {{at the end}} of AD 31, he was arrested, summarily {{executed}} and {{his body}} unceremoniously cast down the Gemonian stairs. What caused his downfall is unclear: ancient historians disagree about the nature of his conspiracy, whether it was Tiberius or Sejanus who struck first and in which order subsequent events occurred. Modern historians consider it unlikely that Sejanus plotted to seize power <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> planned so at all, rather might have aimed at overthrowing Tiberius to serve as a regent to Tiberius Gemellus, son of Drusus or possibly Gaius Caligula. Unfortunately the relevant section pertaining to this period in the Annals of Tacitus has been lost. According to Josephus, it was Antonia, the mother of Livilla, who finally alerted Tiberius to the growing threat Sejanus posed (possibly with information provided by Satrius Secundus), in a letter she dispatched to Capri in the care of her freedman Pallas. According to Juvenal, a letter was sent from Capri with the orders to execute Sejanus without a trial.|$|E

5|$|What {{followed}} Marcellinus's act of traditio, if it {{ever actually}} happened, is unclear. There {{appears to have been}} a break in the episcopal succession, however. Marcellinus seems to have died on October 25, 304, <b>and</b> (<b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> apostatized) was probably expelled from the church in early 303, but his successor, Marcellus, was not consecrated until either November or December 306. In the meantime, two factions diverged in the Roman church, separating the lapsed, Christians who had complied with the edicts to ensure their own safety, and the rigorists, those who would brook no compromise with secular authority. These two groups clashed in street fights and riots, eventually leading to murders. It is said that Marcellus, a rigorist, purged all mention of Marcellinus from church records, and removed his name from the official list of bishops. Marcellus himself was banished from the city, and died in exile on January 16, 309.|$|E
25|$|After {{a tour of}} the United States {{with his}} brother, Haig {{attended}} university, studying Political Economy, Ancient History and French Literature at Brasenose College, Oxford, 1880–1883. He devoted much of his time to socialising – {{he was a member of}} the Bullingdon Club – and equestrian sports. He was one of the best young horsemen at Oxford and quickly found his way into the University polo team. Although he passed his exams (a requirement for university applicants to Sandhurst), he was not eligible for a degree as he had missed a term's residence due to sickness, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> stayed for longer he would have been above the then age limit (23) to begin officer training in the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, which he entered in January 1884. Because he had been to university Haig was considerably older than most of his class at Sandhurst, and was Senior Under-Officer, was awarded the Anson Sword, and passed out first in the order of merit. He was commissioned as a lieutenant into the 7th (Queen's Own) Hussars on 7 February 1885.|$|E

500|$|It was in Lucknow where Henderson met {{his future}} wife, Eleanor, {{at the age}} of 15 while he was working at a grocery store. They married in 1962 and, wanting to ensure he could provide for his wife, he {{considered}} giving up the game to become a history and physical education teacher. [...] His father convinced him to remain in hockey, warning him that he would regret {{it for the rest of}} his life if he never tried to make the National Hockey League (NHL). After considering his father's advice and talking with Eleanor, Henderson decided to play two additional years, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not reached the NHL by 1964, he would quit the game and focus on his education.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the bombing, the {{national}} media seized upon the fact that 19 of the victims had been babies and children, many in the day-care center. At the time of the bombing, there were 100day-care centers in the United States in 7,900federal buildings. McVeigh later stated that he was unaware of the day-care center when choosing the building as a target, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> known [...] "...it might have given me pause to switch targets.

500|$|When the {{situation}} in Czechoslovakia was discussed with the Politburo, Brezhnev was not the one pushing hardest {{for the use of}} military force. Brezhnev was aware of the dire situation he was in, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> abstained or voted against Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia he may have been faced with growing turmoil— domestically and in the Eastern Bloc. Archival evidence suggests that Brezhnev {{was one of the few}} who was looking for a temporary compromise with the reform-friendly Czechoslovak government when their relationship was at the brink. Significant voices in the Soviet leadership demanded the re-installation of a so-called 'revolutionary government'. After the military intervention in 1968, Brezhnev met with Czechoslovak reformer Bohumil Simon, then a member of the Politburo of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and said, [...] "If I had not voted for Soviet armed assistance to Czechoslovakia you would not be sitting here today, but quite possibly I wouldn't either." ...|$|E
500|$|This episode {{featured}} {{a lot of}} character development {{that many of the}} actors had been waiting for. Lana's jealousy over Clark and Chloe going to the prom begins to come out; although Kristin Kreuk believes that Lana {{does not want to be}} jealous, and wants to be able to support Clark with his newfound feelings for Chloe. According to Eric Johnson, Whitney finally gets to show a side of himself that Johnson wishes the audience would have been able to see sooner, as Whitney gives Lana a private dance before the prom knowing that she will not be able to go because he is leaving town. To add further depth to his character not previously seen, Millar and Gough decided to send Whitney off to war, instead of killing the character outright. The idea of sending Whitney off to war was something that came to Millar and Gough midway through the season. They knew they did not want to kill him, because they wanted the ability to bring him back at some point in the future, so they came up with this [...] "noble, heroic, send-off" [...] for the character. For Lex, this episode featured the moment when he finally began to contemplate what his life would be like if his father was no longer a part of it. As Rosenbaum sees it, the moment that Lex hesitates to free his father from the support beam that collapses on him is the moment that the audience gets to see a hint of the evil man they know Lex will one day become. This is a brief moment where Lex forgets who he is, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> let his father die he would have certainly made his [...] "turn to the dark side".|$|E
