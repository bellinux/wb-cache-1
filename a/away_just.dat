5|$|The {{stand down}} order had meant RAF Bomber Command's {{contribution}} to the proceedings came relatively late in the day. It dispatched a total of 73 bombers at between 13:55 and 14:50 (GMT). None of the attackers succeeded in hitting their targets. At 14:35 nine Bristol Beauforts from No. 42 Squadron led by W.H Cliff took off. Arriving over Manston at 14:50 they found other aircraft from No. 407 RCAF orbiting. It took nearly 30 minutes to form a proper formation. With several other squadrons they attacked the Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen at heights of between 60 and 100 feet but their torpedoes missed. No losses were suffered by No. 42 Squadron. The Hudsons struck at between 400 and 900 feet. Two RCAF bombers were lost without success. No. 217 Squadron nearly achieved a hit on Gneisenau, but the ship turned <b>away,</b> <b>just</b> missing the salvo. Later, another wave of 134—137 bombers intercepted the ships between 16:00 and 17:05. Only 20 crews managed to make attacks owing to poor training (Bomber Command crews were not trained to hit naval targets), a low cloud base (700 metres) and poor visibility (sea level visibility was between 1,000 and 2,000 yards). Nine bombers were lost. Another formation of 35 Vickers Wellington aircraft attempted a strike between 17:50 and 18:15, losing two of their number. The most notable raid in this action was by six Beauforts from No. 86, three from No. 217 and three from No. 22 Squadron. Wing Commander C. Flood, No. 86 Squadron led the attack in the only ASV-loaded aircraft. Locating the German ships in the darkness they attacked, but heavy AAA fire scattered the bombers and no successes were achieved. Of the 242 bombers that {{took part in the}} missions, it is likely only 39 conducted attacks, though it is possible that a further 16 carried out attacks, suggesting a total of 54 aircraft actually released their bombs against the ships. Of this total 15 of those were shot down. RAF Fighter Command also threw in fighter-bombers to try and inflict damage, operating Hawker Hurricanes over the Dover area.|$|E

He soon rose to prominence with 71 wickets from just 20 matches. He performed well in other forms such as List A and Twenty20 Cricket, too.|$|E

25|$|Suddenly, all is dark. The transport's {{headlights}} flicker back on, illuminating walls swarming {{with thousands}} of beetles.

He warned the other Puma pilot, who was able to bank <b>away</b> <b>just</b> in time so that the tank round missed the aircraft. No paratroopers were found and the two Pumas returned to the HAA.

25|$|It was March 1968 at a minor club meeting when 17-year-old racer Barry Sheene {{lined up}} on the {{starting}} grid, on a works 125cc Bultaco, for his first race. It was an impressive debut by anyone's standards. Sheene had worked his way up to second place and threatening the leader, Mike Lewis, when the bike seized and spat its rider off over the handlebars. A rostrum position in the day's 250cc race was a great achievement, but an even better wasn’t very far <b>away.</b> <b>Just</b> one week later, and again at Brands, Sheene took his first race win, and he did it is style by an incredible 12 seconds. And the best was yet to come, for he dominated a field of 350cc machines, riding special 250cc Bultaco (with an enlarged 280cc capacity).|$|E

25|$|Since LGBT {{people began}} to {{organize}} for their social and legal rights, access to equal health care has remained an important but often not primary issue. LGBT-specific health organizations have been formed, including charities educating on specific issues, health clinics, and even professional organizations for LGBT people and their allies. Many of them have advocated for specific changes to various governmental practices, and the ongoing effort to legalize same-sex marriage often includes examples of LGBT people unable to secure health coverage equivalent to that of their heterosexual counterparts. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States includes new protections for LGBT people. Under the ACA insurers can no longer turn someone <b>away</b> <b>just</b> because she or he is lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. In addition, ACA is funding preventive efforts for communities, including {{millions of dollars to}} use evidence-based interventions to address HIV-related health disparities. The Department of Health and Human Services is working with community centers serving the LGBT community to employ proven prevention strategies.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{the face}} is in the water during front crawl with eyes looking at {{the lower part of}} the wall in front of the pool, with the {{waterline}} between the brow line and the hairline. Breaths are taken through the mouth by turning the head to the side of a recovering arm at the beginning of the recovery, and breathing in the triangle between the upper arm, lower arm, and the waterline. The swimmer's forward movement will cause a bow wave with a trough in the water surface near the ears. After turning the head, a breath can be taken in this trough without the need to move the mouth above the average water surface. A thin film of water running down the head can be blown <b>away</b> <b>just</b> before the intake. The head is rotated back at the end of the recovery and points down and forward again when the recovered hand enters the water. The swimmer breathes out through mouth and nose until the next breath. Breathing out through the nose may help to prevent water from entering the nose. Swimmers with allergies exacerbated by time in the pool should not expect exhaling through the nose to completely prevent intranasal irritation.|$|E

25|$|The 86 riders {{remaining}} in the race took off from the Al Thakhira harbour. It would be another day across the peninsula {{under the influence of}} strong winds. Despite several attempts, the pack remained bunched all the way to Al Zubara, north-west of Qatar. The first hour had an avarege speed of 48 kilometres per hour. The first bonus sprint was won by Kirsten Wild As the pack headed up north and the wind started blowing sideways, several riders failed {{to keep up with the}} pace. While a crash occurred in the peloton, a group of 18 ladies pulled away including race leader Chloe Hosking, Ellen van Dijk, Wild, Gracie Elvin, and Trixi Worrack. The front group enjoyed a 40” lead at km 83 on a group of 22 including Cromwell, Gilmour and Bronzini. With 25 kilometres to go, as the riders entered the final circuit, the first two groups bunched up together again. 8 riders gave it a go but where rapidly caught before reaching Madinat Al Shamal for the second bonus sprint won by Lisa Brennauer ahead of Chantal Blaak, who had both broken <b>away</b> <b>just</b> before crossing the line. Wild powered to third spot ahead of the pack, 5” adrift. With 10 kilometres to go, Brennauer and Blaak could still enjoy a 10” lead. Both were first caught by Fahlin and Cantele and then by the whole golden jersey group with 5 kilometres to go. Just under 40 riders moved closer to the finish line. With under 3 kilometres to go, race leader Hosking suffered a puncture. Despite being eventually given the winner’s time, she could no longer hope for stage victory and extra bonus seconds.
