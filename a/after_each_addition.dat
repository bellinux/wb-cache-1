40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report a}} novel solid phase method for the {{sequential}} coupling of heterobifunctional macromonomers {{to form a}} new class of polymeric materials that we refer to as polymacromers. Starting from an azide functional substrate, α-azido, ω-protected-alkyne macromonomers are added sequen-tially by thermally initiated click reactions to form poly-macromer brushes wherein macromonomers are linked via triazole groups. <b>After</b> <b>each</b> <b>addition</b> step, the terminal alkyne group can be deprotected to allow addition of the next macromonomer. The use of highly chemoselective click chemistry for the coupling reactions allows virtually any macromonomer to be employed, regardless of its chemical nature.

40|$|Ethanol and {{methanol}} are {{two important}} alcohols used for different purposes. Consequently, also the analytical {{methods used to}} determine them are of considerable interest. Our team is therefore developing three different sensor-based methods for ethanol and methanol determination. Two of these consist of different enzyme electrodes and have been developed by immobilizing either alcohol oxidase or catalase in a kappa-Carrageenan gel layer overlapping an amperometric gaseous diffusion Clark type oxygen electrode. The variation of the oxygen concentration in the aqueous solution due to the enzymatic reactions was measured at a constant applied potential of – 650 mV. The responses of these biosensors toward standard solutions of methanol or ethanol were recorded, compared and discussed. In {{the case of the}} catalase electrode, the measurement was performed by adding hydrogen peroxide to a buffer solution which was diffused through the dialysis membrane towards the enzymatic layer where the reaction catalysed by the catalase enzyme took place: H 2 O 2 1 / 2 O 2 + H 2 O. Since this reaction led to the production of oxygen, the concentration of the latter in the measurement solution increased. This increase triggered an increase in the cathodic current measured which increased from the original value to a new value corresponding to a new stationary state. At this stage further additions were made (equal to 20 μL) of a standard solution of 0. 008 mol L- 1 of ethanol or methanol; <b>after</b> <b>each</b> <b>addition</b> a reaction of the following type occurred which was catalyzed by catalase: CH 3 CH 2 OH + H 2 O 2 CH 3 CHO + 2 H 2 O. The second reaction removed part of the H 2 O 2 substrate from the first reaction, which was slowed down; this slowdown was accompanied by a decrease in the level of oxygen produced in the solution during the first reaction; this decrease was evidenced by the decrease in the measured cathodic current which attained a new stationary state <b>after</b> <b>each</b> <b>addition</b> of alcohol solution. The current variation was read off after each alcohol addition [1]. With the biosensor operating with alcohol oxidase the operating procedure was much simpler as it consisted of directly making successive additions of the standard ethanol or methanol solution to a buffer solution in which the measurement was being performed. <b>After</b> <b>each</b> <b>addition</b> a reaction catalyzed by the alcohol oxidase enzyme of the following type took place: CH 3 CH 2 OH + O 2 CH 3 CHO + H 2 O 2. The reaction led to the oxygen present in the solution being consumed with a consequent decrease in the cathodic current measured until a new stationary state was reached. Also in this case, <b>after</b> <b>each</b> <b>addition,</b> the current variation was read off. All the experiments were carried out in a reaction cell thermostated at 23 °C containing 15 mL of 0. 05 mol L- 1 phosphate buffer solution. The effect of pH on the response of the electrodes was investigated in detail and the best pH was found to be 7. 5 for the catalase electrode and 8. 0 for the alcohol oxidase electrode, respectively. The catalase biosensor displayed a much greater sensitivity to ethanol than to methanol, unlike the alcohol oxidase biosensor. It also displayed a stability and a life-time at least triple that of the alcohol oxidase biosensor as well as an LOD at least one decade lower. It also displayed a better repeatability and reproducibilty for ethanol and methanol solutions. The alcohol oxidase biosensor was instead found to be more sensitive to methanol than to ethanol but allowed the test to be carried out slightly faster than with the catalase device. In conclusion, our team is now investigating the feasibility of using a small catalytic ‘fuel cell’ originally constructed for the purpose of obtaining energy from methanol or ethanol but now adapted for analytical purposes [2, 3]. The intention is to see whether this kind of device can also be used for ethanol and methanol determination. To this end water-alcohol solutions containing increasing percentages of ethanol or methanol are added to the cell, then following the potential increase that occurs at two electrodes of the cell and lastly reading off the maximum potential obtained with each addition. Although this part of the research is only at the preliminary stage it has already been possible to obtain calibration curves for both methanol and ethanol. A comparison of the linearit...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Iterative {{algorithms}} such as {{maximum likelihood}} expectation maximization (ML-EM) algorithm are rapidly becoming {{the standard for}} image reconstruction in emission computed tomography. The maximum likelihood approach provides images with superior noise characteristics compared to conventional filtered backprojection algorithm. A major drawback of the iterative image reconstruction methods is their high computational cost. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm called the improved ordered subset expectation maximization (IOS-EM) algorithm. This algorithm modifies the number of projections in each subset and the step size (i. e., the relaxation factor) for each iteration in order to recover various frequency components in early iteration steps. In the method presented in this paper, the number of projections in a subset increases and the step size decreases <b>after</b> <b>each</b> iteration. In <b>addition,</b> pixel data are grouped into subdivisions to accelerate image reconstruction. Experimental {{results show that the}} IOS-EM algorithm can provide high quality reconstructed images at a small number of iterations.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the impact of short-term normobaric hypoxia on physiology and performance in highly trained athletes. Twelve (7 male and 5 female) athletes were randomly assigned into two groups and spent 8 h per night for two consecutive nights a week over 3 weeks under either short-term normobaric hypoxia (simulating 3636 m altitude, inspired O 2 = 13 %) or in normobaric normoxia in a single-blind study. Following a 3 week washout period, athletes were then exposed to the other condition. Athletes were tested for maximal oxygen consumption and time to exhaustion on an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer before and <b>after</b> <b>each</b> treatment in <b>addition</b> to being tested for anaerobic performance (Wingate test) on a modified Monark cycle ergometer. Blood samples were taken throughout the experiment and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were taken before and <b>after</b> <b>each</b> treatment. Increases in red blood cell count, haematocrit, haemoglobin, platelet number and erythropoietin concentration were observed following short-term normobaric hypoxia. Except for a modest decrease in phosphofructokinase activity following short-term normobaric hypoxia, no changes were observed in muscle enzyme activities, buffer capacity, capillary density or morphology. No performance measures were changed following short-term normobaric hypoxia or normobaric normoxia. Although short-term normobaric hypoxia exposure increased levels {{of a number of}} haematological parameters, this was not associated with improved aerobic or anaerobic performance in highly trained athletes...|$|R
