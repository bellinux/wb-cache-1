5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} can {{be divided}} into thermotropic, lyotropic and metallotropic phases. Thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals consist mostly of organic molecules, although a few minerals are also known. Thermotropic LCs exhibit a phase transition into the liquid-crystal phase as temperature is changed. Lyotropic LCs exhibit phase transitions as a function of both temperature <b>and</b> <b>concentration</b> of the liquid-crystal molecules in a solvent (typically water). Metallotropic LCs are composed of both organic and inorganic molecules; their liquid-crystal transition depends not only on temperature <b>and</b> <b>concentration,</b> but also on the inorganic-organic composition ratio.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the invasion, both {{mountain}} detachments had completed mobilisation <b>and</b> <b>concentration,</b> and were in position. Detachment Lika was at its mobilisation centre, but the turn-out of men for its infantry component was low. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was completing its concentration. A large proportion of the 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski was moving from its mobilisation centres to its concentration areas. Across the 7th Army, around 80 percent of troops had answered the mobilisation order, but only 45 to 50 percent of vehicles and animals were available.|$|E

50|$|Charter Oak State College offers Master's, Bachelor's and {{associate}} degree programs, {{as well as}} certificate and credential programs. Charter Oak divides bachelor's degree programs of study into majors <b>and</b> <b>concentrations.</b> At Charter Oak, both majors <b>and</b> <b>concentrations</b> are used to specify a student's primary field of study.

In this way, a concentration is similar to a major, but it allows the student to work with the credits he/she may already have where appropriate to create a degree plan that meets his/her career and personal goals. This enables the student to personalize his/her degree based on his/her specific career goal.|$|R

From Namsos to Brønnøysund there were available seats in the cabin, but the jump seat passenger continued {{to sit in the}} cockpit. The commission felt that the passenger's conversation with the captain drew his attention <b>and</b> <b>concentration</b> away from his duties at a critical point of the flight. This also disrupted communication between the two pilots, resulting in the mutual control being disrupted.|$|E

5|$|Diptera {{have one}} pair of fore wings on the {{mesothorax}} {{and a pair of}} halteres, or reduced hind wings, on the metathorax. A further adaptation for flight is the reduction in number of the neural ganglia, <b>and</b> <b>concentration</b> of nerve tissue in the thorax, a feature that is most extreme in the highly derived Muscomorpha infraorder. Some species of flies are exceptional in that they are secondarily flightless. The only other order of insects bearing a single pair of true, functional wings, in addition to any form of halteres, are the Strepsiptera. In contrast to the flies, the Strepsiptera bear their halteres on the mesothorax and their flight wings on the metathorax. Each of the fly's six legs has a typical insect structure of coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and tarsus, with the tarsus in most instances being subdivided into five tarsomeres. At the tip of the limb is a pair of claws, and between these are cushion-like structures known as pulvilli which provide adhesion.|$|E

5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 6 April, German aircraft caught the air reconnaissance assets of the 4th Army {{on the ground at}} Velika Gorica, destroying most of them. The continuing mobilisation <b>and</b> <b>concentration</b> of the 4th Army was hampered by escalating fifth column activities and propaganda fomented by the Ustaše. Some units stopped mobilising, or began returning to their mobilisation centres from their concentration areas. During the day, Yugoslav sabotage units attempted to destroy bridges over the Mura at Letenye, Mursko Središće and Kotoriba, and over the Drava at Gyékényes. These attempts were only partially successful, due to the influence of Ustaše propaganda and the countermanding of demolition orders by the {{chief of staff of the}} 27th Infantry Division Savska. The Yugoslav radio network in the 4th Army area was sabotaged by the Ustaše on 6 April, and radio communications within the 4th Army remained poor throughout the fighting.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} odour, {{greenhouse}} gas emissions and indoor air quality in swine buildings have become a great concern for the neighbouring communities as well as governments. Air dispersion models have been adopted widely as an approach to address these problems which determine science-based distance between livestock production site and neighbours. However, no existing model considers the diurnal and seasonal variations of odour, gas (ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, greenhouse gas), <b>and</b> dust <b>concentrations</b> <b>and</b> emissions, which may cause great uncertainty. The primary objective of this project is to monitor and model the diurnal and seasonal variations of odour, gases, <b>and</b> dust <b>concentrations</b> <b>and</b> emissions from nursery, farrowing, and gestation rooms. Additionally, this study tried to quantify the greenhouse gas contribution from swine buildings and evaluate the indoor air quality of swine barns. Strip-block experimental design {{was used to measure}} the diurnal variation of odour <b>and</b> gas <b>concentrations</b> <b>and</b> emissions in PSC Elstow Research Farm. It was found that: 1) odour <b>and</b> gas <b>concentrations</b> in winter were significantly higher than those in mild and warm weather conditions for all three rooms (P 0. 05); 3) significant diurnal variations occurred in August and April (P 0. 05); 4) apparent diurnal variation patterns were observed in August and April for NH 3, H 2 S <b>and</b> CO 2 <b>concentrations,</b> being high in the early morning and low in the late afternoon; 5) positive correlation was found between odour <b>concentrations</b> <b>and</b> NH 3, H 2 S, <b>and</b> CO 2 <b>concentrations,</b> respectively.
