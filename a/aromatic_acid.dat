Distribution of the <b>aromatic</b> <b>acids</b> in the aquatic environment can provide basic information on the different sources of the overall dissolved organic matter. In this study, a CE method was developed for the determination of <b>aromatic</b> <b>acids.</b> A complete separation of seven <b>aromatic</b> <b>acids</b> was achieved in 12 minutes using the optimized CE method. A good linearity was observed for all analytes over a concentration range of 0. 25 to 100 [M. The correlation coefficients (R 2) of the calibration curves of seven <b>aromatic</b> <b>acids</b> were higher than 0. 997.

The CE method combined with solid-phase extraction (SPE) or solid-phase microextraction (SPME) was applied to the analysis of <b>aromatic</b> <b>acids</b> in natural water, soil and sediment samples. Explosives analysis is of major importance in both forensic and environmental applications. Micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MECC) is an adaptation of CE where the addition of a charged micellar agent to the electrolyte provides a separation for neutral molecules. A MECC method was developed in this study for explosives analysis. All 17 explosives were well separated under 9 minutes using the optimized MECC method. The potential of using SPME as sample preparation method for CE was investigated. With features such as high separation efficiency, short analysis time, low reagent consumption and simplicity, this study demonstrated that CE method is promising for both environmental and forensic applications...|$|R

40|$|A {{quantitative}} capillary assay {{was used}} to show that <b>aromatic</b> <b>acids,</b> compounds that are chemorepellents for Escherichia coli and Salmonella sp., are chemoattractants for Pseudomonas putida PRS 2000. The most effective attractants were benzoate; p-hydroxybenzoate; the methylbenzoates; m-, p-, and o-toluate; salicylate; DL-mandelate; beta-phenylpyruvate; and benzoylformate. The chemotactic responses to these compounds were inducible. Taxis to benzoate and m-toluate was induced by beta-ketoadipate, a metabolic intermediate formed when benzoate is dissimilated via enzymes specified by chromosomal genes. Benzoylformate taxis was induced by benzoylformate and L(+) -mandelate. Taxis to mandelate, benzoylformate, and beta-phenylpyruvate was exhibited by cells grown on mandelate, but not by cells grown on benzoate. Cells grown on benzoate were chemotactic to benzoate, the toluates, p-hydroxybenzoate, and salicylate. These results show that P. putida synthesizes at least two distinct chemoreceptors for <b>aromatic</b> <b>acids.</b> Although DL-mandelate was an effective attractant in capillary assays, additional experiments indicated that the cells were actually responding to benzoylformate, a metabolite formed from mandelate. With the exception of mandelate taxis, chemotaxis to <b>aromatic</b> <b>acids</b> was not dependent on the expression of pathways for aromatic degradation. Therefore, the tactic responses exhibited by cells cannot be attributed to an effect of the oxidation of <b>aromatic</b> <b>acids</b> on the energy metabolism of cells...|$|R

To facilitate {{the use of this}} method for the quantitative analyses of <b>aromatic</b> <b>acids</b> in aqueous solutions, analytical functions were also developed in this work and a linear relationship between analytical responses and concentrations of analytes can be obtained. To optimize the analytical conditions, the factors that influence the IR spectroscopic signals were examined. These factors included response time, CD loadings of the sensors, pH effect on response, regeneration efficiency and stability of sensors. Under the optimal conditions, the detection limits for <b>aromatic</b> <b>acids</b> at a detection time of 2 min can be < 100 mugL. Meanwhile, the dynamic linear range for detection was only ca. two orders of magnitude if direct IR signals were used.
