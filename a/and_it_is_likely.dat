5|$|A {{church in}} Ickenham is not {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Book <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that residents travelled to nearby Harefield for services. The original nave and chancel of St Giles' church have been dated to 1335 while the nave was extended west in 1959. The bell turret was built in the 15th century and a brick aisle added in 1575.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht Dürer {{was an avid}} {{student of}} exotic animals, and drew many {{sketches}} based on his visits to European zoos. Dürer visited 's-Hertogenbosch during Bosch's lifetime, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> the two artists met, and that Bosch drew inspiration from the German's work.|$|E
5|$|By October 1938, {{the ship}} had been renamed Pan Gulf to reflect the naming style of her new owners, the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company, a {{subsidiary}} of Waterman Steamship Company. The Pan-Atlantic Line sailed in coastal service along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that Pan Gulf called at typical Pan-Atlantic ports such as Baltimore, Miami, Tampa, New Orleans, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston during this time.|$|E
50|$|In 1527 {{he was in}} Wolsey's service. He proved his age on 23 September 1529, and {{was soon}} {{afterwards}} knighted. According to Hicks, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> Wolsey who chose Katherine Conyers (d.1566), the daughter of William Conyers, 1st Baron Conyers, as Francis' wife, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> Wolsey to whom her marriage portion was paid.|$|R
50|$|The British government, under Prime Minister William Gladstone, <b>was</b> conciliatory as <b>it</b> {{realised}} {{that any}} further action would require substantial troop reinforcements, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> {{that the war}} would be costly, messy and protracted. Unwilling to get bogged down in a distant war, the British government ordered a truce.|$|R
25|$|Chichen Itza {{was one of}} {{the largest}} Maya cities <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> to have <b>been</b> one of the mythical great cities, or Tollans, {{referred}} to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.|$|R
5|$|Ecgberht {{was buried}} in Winchester, as were his son, Æthelwulf, his grandson, Alfred the Great, and his great-grandson, Edward the Elder. During the ninth century, Winchester began {{to show signs of}} urbanisation, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that the {{sequence}} of burials indicates that Winchester was held in high regard by the West Saxon royal line.|$|E
5|$|On October 28, 1824, Coffin {{married his}} long-time friend, Catharine White. The wedding {{ceremony}} {{was held in}} the Hopewell Friends Meetinghouse in North Carolina. Catharine's family {{is believed to have been}} involved in helping slaves escape, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> she met Coffin because of this activity.|$|E
5|$|Such long-distance {{high-speed}} railways are {{not included}} in the preliminary long-term plan for 2010–2040, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that railways Hamar–Trondheim and Drammen–Kristansand will be built first since they are easier to build. It is likely that a high-speed railway to Bergen will be built sometime in the period 2030–2060.|$|E
50|$|At LDEF's launch, {{retrieval}} {{was scheduled}} for March 19, 1985, eleven months after deployment. Schedules slipped, postponing the retrieval mission first to 1986, then indefinitely due to the Challenger disaster. After 5.7 years its orbit had decayed to about 175 nautical miles <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> to burn up on reentry in {{a little over a}} month.|$|R
50|$|Chichen Itza {{was one of}} {{the largest}} Maya cities <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> to have <b>been</b> one of the mythical great cities, or Tollans, {{referred}} to in later Mesoamerican literature.

5|$|The {{number of}} North Korean forces {{committed}} to the region is not known, however later {{research suggests that the}} North Korean 6th Division committed at least a battalion to the fight, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that an entire regiment was ordered to advance on the Notch and Masan. This would put the range of North Korean forces involved in the battle between 500 and 2,000.|$|E
5|$|Although the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia share English as {{a common}} oral and written language, ASL is not {{mutually}} intelligible with British Sign Language (BSL) or Auslan. All three languages show degrees of borrowing from English, but this alone is not sufficient for cross-language comprehension. It {{has been found that}} a relatively high percentage (37–44%) of ASL signs have similar translations in Auslan, which for oral languages would suggest that they belong to the same language family. However, this does not seem justified historically for ASL and Auslan, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that this resemblance is due to the higher degree of iconicity in sign languages in general, as well as contact with English.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} June 1860, Rossier was in Shanghai, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that {{he visited}} the city {{in an attempt to}} gain {{permission}} to accompany the Anglo-French military expedition that had already arrived in northern China and thereby fulfill his commission to document the Second Opium War. If so, he was unsuccessful; both forces had already hired photographers to document the mission. The British forces were accompanied by the photographers Felice Beato and John Papillon, and the French by Antoine Fauchery, Lieutenant-Colonel Du Pin, and possibly also by Louis Legrand. Although Rossier failed even to embark on the mission he had been hired to document, he remained in East Asia for some time longer.|$|E

50|$|The Rose Bowl {{committee}} had both USC and Tennessee {{on their list}} <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> that USC <b>and</b> Tennessee would play each other. The Volunteers were offered a berth in the Sugar Bowl on November 25. The Volunteers also were in the mix for the 1940 Cotton Bowl, which would have pitted them against the #1 Texas A&M Aggies. But the Rose Bowl committee did not extend official invitations until December 10, 1939.|$|R
50|$|No {{conclusion}} can {{be reached}} {{about the fate of}} U-47, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> thought <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> the result of a diving accident.|$|R
5|$|During this time, Johnson's {{future was}} {{uncertain}} {{because his father}} was deeply in debt. To earn money, Johnson began to stitch books for his father, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that Johnson spent much time in his father's bookshop reading and building his literary knowledge. The family remained in poverty until Sarah Johnson's cousin, Elizabeth Harriotts, died in February 1728 and left enough money to send Johnson to university. On 31 October 1728, {{a few weeks after}} he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford. The inheritance did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and fellow student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit.|$|E
5|$|In August 1933, the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} that the Shepard Line had secured a year-long charter of Exford for their expanded intercoastal service between North Atlantic ports and the Pacific ports of Los Angeles; San Francisco; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle. Later in 1933, the ship was renamed Pan Royal to reflect the naming style of her new owners, the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company, a subsidiary of Waterman Steamship Company. The Pan-Atlantic Line sailed in coastal service along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that Pan Royal called at typical Pan-Atlantic ports such as Baltimore, Miami, Tampa, New Orleans, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston from this time.|$|E
5|$|King Henry {{withdrew his}} favour {{from the family}} after William's son {{organised}} the murder of Seisyll ap Dyfnwal and other Welsh princes at Abergavenny in 1176. There is little subsequent record of William in public life, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that he retired to his estates in Sussex. William died after 1179 and was succeeded by his son, William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber, who gained the favour of both King Richard I and King John and became a dominant force in the Welsh Marches during their reigns.|$|E

2500|$|But as we stood, {{one of the}} porters behind {{called out}} [...] "Simba"; and we {{caught a glimpse of}} a big lioness {{galloping}} down beside the trees, just beyond the donga … Tarlton took his big double-barrel and advised me to take mine, as the sun had just set <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> close work; but I shook my head, for the Winchester 405 is, at least for me personally, the [...] "medicine gun" [...] for lions.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the Phrygian Kingdom was {{overwhelmed}} by Cimmerian invaders around 690 BC, then briefly conquered by its neighbour Lydia, before it passed successively into the Persian Empire of Cyrus the Great and the empire of Alexander and his successors, {{was taken by the}} Attalids of Pergamon, and eventually became part of the Roman Empire. The last mention of the Phrygian language in literature dates to the fifth century AD <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> extinct by the seventh century.|$|R
5|$|Nevertheless, she {{was working}} on her third novel, Beauty's Hour, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that Yeats read the manuscript, {{suggested}} revisions, and {{may have contributed to the}} characterisations. Kline believes the two began a friendship based on the discussion of literature and his willingness to review her work; Yeats biographer Foster adds they were drawn together by a mutual interest in the occult. For Yeats, then aged 30, an important aspect of their friendship was the opportunity it presented for a sexual relationship with a woman, something he had not then experienced.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys dimidiatus is now {{recognized}} as one of eight species in the genus Oryzomys. O.dimidiatus is further part of the O.couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes six other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. O.couesi occurs with O.dimidiatus in southeastern Nicaragua. Many aspects of the systematics of the O.couesi section remain unclear <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that the current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group. Oryzomys is classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi is the southeasternmost {{representative}} of the genus Oryzomys, which extends north into the eastern United States (marsh rice rat, O.palustris). O.gorgasi is further part of the O.couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes six other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. Many aspects of the systematics of the O.couesi section remain unclear <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that the current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group.

50|$|C. manueli is {{somewhat}} rare throughout its distribution and {{is affected by}} deforestation, desertification, <b>and</b> overgrazing. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that the species is in decline, and its range is severely fragmented.|$|R
50|$|Gibson Les Paul Jr. - During Picciotto's {{time with}} Rites of Spring {{and during the}} early days of Fugazi (photos show until at least as late as 1993) he could also be seen playing a white, Gibson Les Paul Doublecut Jr with a single P90 pickup. In an NPR {{interview}} done in 2011, Picciotto is quoted as having had a Gibson SG Jr. stolen in NYC. The NPR article may <b>be</b> incorrect about <b>it</b> being an SG <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> the same Les Paul JR guitar.|$|R
5|$|Telangiectasias and {{arteriovenous}} malformations in HHT {{are thought}} to arise because of changes in angiogenesis, the development of blood vessels out of existing ones. The {{development of a new}} blood vessel requires the activation and migration of various types of cells, chiefly endothelium, smooth muscle and pericytes. The exact mechanism by which the HHT mutations influence this process is not yet clear, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that they disrupt a balance between pro- and antiangiogenic signals in blood vessels. The wall of telangiectasias is unusually friable, which explains the tendency of these lesions to bleed.|$|E
5|$|The Emperors Hadrian, Septimius Severus and Constantius I all held {{court in}} York during their various campaigns. During his stay 207–211AD, the Emperor Severus proclaimed York {{capital of the}} {{province}} of Britannia Inferior, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that {{it was he who}} granted York the privileges of a colonia or city. Constantius I died in 306AD during his stay in York, and his son Constantine the Great was proclaimed Emperor by the troops based in the fortress. In 311AD a bishop from York attended the Council at Arles to represent Christians from the province.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} over the succession suggests that Offa needed to re-establish control over Mercia's traditional dependencies, {{such as the}} Hwicce and the Magonsæte. Charters dating from {{the first two years}} of Offa's reign show the Hwiccan kings as reguli, or kinglets, under his authority; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> that he was also quick to gain control over the Magonsæte, for whom there is no record of an independent ruler after 740. Offa was probably able to exert control over the kingdom of Lindsey at an early date, as it appears that the independent dynasty of Lindsey had disappeared by this time.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} Admiral Johansen {{informed}} {{the captain of}} the Tryggvason, T. Briseid, {{that there had been a}} battle at the mouth of the Oslofjord, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> that the enemy ships had breached the outer fortifications. Briseid was given orders to open fire on any hostile ships. Johansen shared his intentions to send the Rauma and the Otra out to sweep the fjord. Briseid dispatched one of his ship's motor boats to Langgrunn where it told the merchant ships at anchor to extinguish their lights.|$|R
