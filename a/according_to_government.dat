5|$|<b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>government</b> {{surveyor}} Thomas Corby, Newton's parakeet {{may still}} have been fairly common in 1843. Slater reported that he saw a single specimen in southwestern Rodrigues during his three-month stay to observe the 1874 Transit of Venus, and assistant colonial secretary William J. Caldwell saw several specimens in 1875 during his own three-month visit. The male that he received in 1875 and gave to Newton is the last recorded member of the species. A series of cyclones struck the following year and may have devastated the remaining population. Further severe storms hit in 1878 and 1886, and since few forested areas were left by this time, there was little cover to protect any remaining birds. The male could, therefore, {{have been the last}} of the species alive.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1974, Australia {{was in an}} {{economic}} slump, suffering from the 1973 oil crisis and 1973–75 recession. The 1973 oil crisis had caused prices to spike and, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>government</b> figures, inflation topped 13percent {{for over a year}} between 1973 and 1974. Part of the inflation was due to Whitlam's desire to increase wages and conditions of the Commonwealth Public Service as a pacesetter for the private sector. The Whitlam government had cut tariffs by 25percent in 1973; 1974 saw an increase in imports of 30percent and a $1.5billion increase in the trade deficit. Primary producers of commodities such as beef were caught in a credit squeeze as short-term rates rose to extremely high levels. Unemployment also rose significantly. Unease within the ALP led to Barnard's defeat when Jim Cairns challenged him for his deputy leadership. Whitlam gave little help to his embattled deputy, who had formed {{the other half of the}} duumvirate.|$|E

Diplomats were surprised by how quickly al-Zawahiri condemned the attack on the mosque and called on Pakistanis to rise up against Musharraf's government. Officials blamed the presence of foreign fighters for the breakdown of negotiations, as they seemed about to reach a deal to end the standoff peacefully. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>government</b> sources and western diplomats, the Al-Qaeda fighters in the mosque sought martyrdom instead.|$|E
