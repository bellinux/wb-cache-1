50|$|Cunningham made {{pioneering}} {{studies in}} <b>aerobiology.</b> He {{made use of}} the aeroconiscope, a device with a vane that pointed a sampling cone towards the wind with a sticky slide placed behind a funnel. The sticky slide would then be examined for aerially dispersed biota. His studies on the microbes, spores and pollen in the air of Calcutta were published in 1873. Cunningham's other major and official work was in studying the nature of spread of cholera. Their official work however did not progress and the project was terminated and in 1879, Cunningham took up an academic position as Professor of Physiology at the Calcutta Medical College. He was also able to pursue his interests in botany being temporarily appointed in 1880 as a superintendent of the Calcutta Royal Botanic Garden as George King, the regular superintendent, {{was put in charge}} of the cinchona plantation in the Mungpoo Hills, Darjeeling District. In 1883, Robert Koch visited India as part of a German cholera research committee and was able to isolate the comma bacteria Vibrio cholera from the autopsy of a cholera victim. This led to the British government being forced to investigate the matter. A committee made up of two leading pathologists, Heneage Gibbes and Emanuel Klein, was set up and they visited Calcutta in November 1884. Cunningham worked with Klein, helping obtain samples from the same water storage which Koch had declared as being the source of the contagion affecting victims. Klein was able to examine and confirm that the bacteria in the water were similar to those in the bacteria in the stools of cholera victims but he was not sure about whether it caused cholera. The results of Koch however were enough for European governments to declare a quarantine on ship-borne visitors from India. The ensuing debate on the financial losses that would be caused led to the British government's decision to increase spending on research facilities and in December 1884, the Sanitary Commissioner was granted 15,000 rupees to set up a laboratory with Cunningham being made the director. In 1887-88 Cunningham accompanied the Sikkim Expedition as Government naturalist. Cunningham {{was a member of the}} council of the Calcutta zoological garden and in 1898, a bronze medallion of him was gifted to the zoological garden. In 1876 he was elected Fellow of the Linnean Society and in June 1889 Fellow of the Royal Society. In June 1893 he was made a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire.|$|E

40|$|Ever {{since the}} middle ages, when the miasmatic theory gave a {{convenient}} explanation of plaques, people suspected the air of being a medium in which particles invisible {{to the naked eye}} are suspended and dispersed. In the 19 th century the controversy over the question of spontaneous generation and the establishement of the science of bacteriology caused a great interest in the micro-flora of the air and thus originates a branch of science known now as <b>aerobiology.</b> <b>Aerobiology</b> as defined by the late F. C. Meier in 1938, is the study of aerial carriage of microscopic particles.

40|$|Grass pollen {{is a major}} {{trigger for}} {{allergic}} rhinitis and asthma, yet {{little is known about}} the timing and levels of human exposure to airborne grass pollen across Australasian urban environments. The relationships between environmental aeroallergen exposure and allergic respiratory disease bridge the fields of ecology, <b>aerobiology,</b> geospatial science and public health. The Australian <b>Aerobiology</b> Working Group comprised of experts in botany, palynology, biogeography, climate change science, plant genetics, biostatistics, ecology, pollen allergy, public and environmental health, and medicine, was established to systematically source, collate and analyse atmospheric pollen concentration data from 11 Australian and six New Zealand sites. Following two week-long workshops, post-workshop evaluations were conducted to reflect upon the utility of this analysis and synthesis approach to address complex multidisciplinary questions. This Working Group described i) a biogeographically dependent variation in airborne pollen diversity, ii) a latitudinal gradient in the timing, duration and number of peaks of the grass pollen season, and iii) the emergence of new methodologies based on trans-disciplinary synthesis of <b>aerobiology</b> and remote sensing data. Challenges included resolving methodological variations between pollen monitoring sites and temporal variations in pollen datasets. Other challenges included "marrying" ecosystem and health sciences and reconciling divergent expert opinion. The Australian <b>Aerobiology</b> Working Group facilitated knowledge transfer between diverse scientific disciplines, mentored students and early career scientists, and provided an uninterrupted collaborative opportunity to focus on a unifying problem globally. The Working Group provided a platform to optimise the value of large existing ecological datasets that have importance for human respiratory health and ecosystems research.

40|$|The overall {{threat of}} a viral {{pathogen}} to human populations is largely determined by the modus operandi and velocity of the pathogen that is transmitted among humans. Microorganisms that can spread by aerosol are considered a more challenging enemy than those that require direct body-to-body contact for transmission, due to the potential for infection of numerous people rather than a single individual. Additionally, disease containment {{is much more difficult}} to achieve for aerosolized viral pathogens than for pathogens that spread solely via direct person-to-person contact.

40|$|Although {{the field}} of <b>aerobiology</b> predates Louis Pasteur’s classic {{experiments}} in the late 19 th century, the atmosphere has recently {{emerged as one of}} the last great frontiers in {{the field of}} microbiology. Recent research has demonstrated that airborne microbes are more diverse than previously thought and are metabolically active in some cases, influencing atmospheric chemistry and meteorological patterns.   Furthermore, concern continues to grow regarding airborne travel of biothreat agents and emerging infectious diseases in an increasingly global society.   Despite the increased recognition of the atmosphere as a frontier for microbiological exploration in both basic and applied sciences, students are generally not exposed to this field of research in the undergraduate biology curriculum.  We describe the use of the Surface Air System (SAS) SUPER 180 (Bioscience International, Rockville, MD), an extremely rugged, easy-to-use, portable and nearly maintenance-free instrument that impacts defined volumes of air directly onto petri dishes to facilitate the study of culturable airborne microorganisms.   We successfully employed this instrument in a Biology I course in which freshmen, with no prior research experiences, conducted discovery-based research that produced data that was presented at a national meeting and made a genuine contribution to the field of <b>aerobiology.</b>   We also describe how such discovery-based research experiences in <b>aerobiology</b> can be used as a platform for teaching core biological concepts and basic laboratory skills.   Editor's Note : The ASM advocates that students must successfully demonstrate the ability to explain and practice safe laboratory techniques.
