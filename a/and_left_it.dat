Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> through an airlock. Another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.|$|E

In late November 2003, CMLL held an eight-team, three-week tournament to crown new champions. Most of the teams in the tournament had not teamed up on a regular basis prior to the show, except for Los Nuevo Infernales. In the end, the team of El Felino, Safari and Volador Jr., who was paired up for the tournament, defeated Alan Stone, Super Crazy, and Zumbido to win the titles.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 against the Seljuk Turks and the {{overthrow}} of Romanos IV Diogenes (r. 1068–71), the Byzantine Empire experienced a decade of near-continuous internal turmoil and rebellions. The constant warfare depleted the Empire's armies, devastated Asia Minor <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> defenceless against the increasing encroachment of the Turks. In the Balkans, invasions by the Pechenegs and the Cumans devastated Bulgaria, and the Serbian princes renounced their allegiance to the Empire.|$|E

5|$|In {{the close}} season of 1954 the English League and the Scottish League were merged {{to form a}} British League. The Panthers {{finished}} second to the Harringay Racers in the eleven team competition. After one season all the Scottish teams, {{with the exception of}} the Paisley Pirates, withdrew from the British League <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> with only five members. The close season of 1955 also saw the departure of Stinchcombe who was replaced as coach by Zamick. The 1955–56 season proved to be one of the club's most successful. Nottingham won the Autumn Cup at the beginning of the season before clinching their third league title on goal average ahead of the Wembley Lions. They also travelled to Sweden where they won the Ahearne Cup.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Ajay Singh Rathod (R. Madhavan), {{a flight}} {{lieutenant}} in the Indian Air Force who is Sonia's fiancé, is killed when his jet, a MiG-21, crashes. The government proclaims that the crash was caused by pilot error and closes the investigation. Knowing that Rathod was an ace pilot, Sonia and her friends do not accept the official explanation. Instead, they claim that he sacrificed his life to save hundreds of other lives {{that would have been}} lost had he ejected from the aircraft <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> to crash into a populous city. They investigate and learn that the crash was due to a corrupt defence minister Shastri (Mohan Agashe), who had signed a contract exchanging cheap and illegal MiG-21 aircraft spare parts for a personal favour. To their surprise, they learn that the key person who was responsible for organizing the deal was Karan's father, Rajnath Singhania (Anupam Kher).|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 1976, as Fox {{was driving}} to the family home at Morrill Street in Port Coquitlam, he became distracted by nearby bridge construction, and crashed {{into the back of}} a pickup truck. While his car was left undriveable, Fox emerged with only a sore right knee. He again felt pain in December, but chose to ignore it until the end of {{basketball}} season. By March 1977, the pain had intensified and he finally went to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of cancer that often starts near the knees. Fox believed his car accident weakened his knee <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> vulnerable to the disease, though his doctors argued there was no connection. He was told that his leg had to be amputated, he would require chemotherapy treatment, and that recent medical advances meant he had a 50-percent chance of survival. Fox learned that two years before, the figure would have been only 15 percent; the improvement in survival rates impressed on him the value of cancer research.|$|E
5|$|Sviatoslav {{retreated to}} Dorostolon, which the Byzantine armies besieged for sixty-five days. Cut off and surrounded, Sviatoslav came {{to terms with}} John and agreed to abandon the Balkans, renounce his claims to the {{southern}} Crimea, and return west of the Dnieper River. In return, the Byzantine emperor supplied the Rus' with food and safe passage home. Sviatoslav and his men set sail and landed on Berezan Island {{at the mouth of}} the Dnieper, where they made camp for the winter. Several months later, their camp was devastated by famine, so that even a horse's head could not be bought for less than a half-grivna, reports the Kievan chronicler of the Primary Chronicle. While Sviatoslav's campaign brought no tangible results for the Rus', it weakened the Bulgarian statehood <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> vulnerable to the attacks of Basil the Bulgar-Slayer four decades later.|$|E

5|$|Despite its {{ceremonial}} role, the Golden Gate {{was one of}} {{the stronger}} positions along the walls of the city, withstanding several attacks during the various sieges. With the addition of transverse walls on the peribolos between the inner and outer walls, it formed a virtually separate fortress. Its military value was recognized by John VI Kantakouzenos (r. 1347–1354), who records that it was virtually impregnable, capable of holding provisions for three years and defying the whole city if need be. He repaired the marble towers and garrisoned the fort with loyal Catalan soldiers, but had to surrender it to John V Palaiologos (r. 1341–1391) when he abdicated in 1354. John V undid Kantakouzenos' repairs <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> unguarded, but in 1389–90 he too rebuilt and expanded the fortress, erecting two towers behind the gate and extending a wall some 350 m to the sea walls, thus forming a separate fortified enceinte inside the city to serve as a final refuge. In the event, John V was soon after forced to flee there from a coup led by his grandson, John VII. The fort held out successfully in the subsequent siege that lasted several months, and in which cannons were possibly employed. In 1391 however, John V was compelled to raze the fort by Sultan Bayezid I (r. 1382–1402), who otherwise threatened to blind his son Manuel, whom he held captive. Emperor John VIII Palaiologos (r. 1425–1448) attempted to rebuild it in 1434, but was thwarted by Sultan Murad II.|$|E
