25|$|Identifying {{himself as}} a new neighbor, Chris makes {{numerous}} unsuccessful attempts to help her realize the true situation. He describes details of his life so {{that she will be}} reminded of her husband. He calls her attention to the improbably negative conditions of the house. He drops clues, gradually leading her to the truth, but she seems to block out <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> cause recognition. He finally tells the truth straight out. She gets angry and calls him a liar. Because she does not believe in an afterlife, she finds it impossible that he could be her dead husband.|$|E
25|$|Recreational {{fishing is}} done for {{pleasure}} or sport, and not for profit or survival. Just about <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> stay afloat can be called a recreational fishing boat, so long as a fisher periodically climbs aboard {{with the intent to}} catch a fish. Usually some form of fishing tackle is brought on board, such as hooks, lines, sinkers or nets. Fish are caught for recreational purposes from boats which range from dugout canoes, kayaks, rafts, pontoon boats and small dinghies to runabouts, cabin cruisers and cruising yachts to large, hi-tech and luxurious big game rigs. Larger boats, purpose-built with recreational fishing in mind, usually have large, open cockpits at the stern, designed for convenient fishing.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate how many recreational fishing boats there are, although the number is high. The term is fluid, since most recreational boats are also used for fishing from time to time. Unlike most commercial fishing vessels, recreational fishing boats are often not dedicated just to fishing.

500|$|Chris Carabott from IGN was {{critical}} of both Shannon and her relationship with Boone before the plane crash, commenting [...] "Shannon's ability to 'sort-of' understand French and Boone's lifeguard training have had little impact and as characters they bring very little to the table. There are also too many more intriguing storylines and characters around them that deserve attention." [...] On their relationship he added, [...] "except for the final act, when they finally succumb to their lust for one another ... There's nothing exciting here or <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> ultimately be built upon in the Lost universe." [...] In a later review, for the episode following Boone's death, he commented [...] " [...] were both left with {{very little to do}} this season. Especially Shannon, whose high point of usefulness was deciphering Rousseau's documents for Sayid. Well, Maggie Grace is given an opportunity to shine and she does an acceptable job as the distraught sibling who is now looking for someone to blame for Boone's death. We finally get to see some real depth to Shannon's character and her quest for vengeance is believable." [...] According to Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Shannon is [...] "the least deserving of sympathy of all the previously known survivors." ...|$|E

Maxy's Integral magazine (Issue 4), he sought to define the political purpose of Romanian Constructivism: [...] "progress is a gradual adaptation [...] least reduced division of labor between men. <b>Anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> slow down that adaptation is immoral, and unjust, and stupid.

The campaign highlights the lengths that Honda engineers go to in order to get the most out of an engine, whether it is for bikes, cars, powerboats – even lawnmowers. Honda released its [...] campaign. In the TV spot, Garrison Keillor says, [...] "An engineer once said to build something great is like swimming in honey", while Honda engineers in white suits walk and run towards a great light, battling strong winds and flying debris, holding on to <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> keep them from being blown away. Finally one of the engineers walks towards a red light, his hand outstretched. A web address is shown for the Hondamentalism website.
