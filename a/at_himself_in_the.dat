25|$|The game also {{includes}} an alternate final level, where the final battle is played from Leo's perspective. He successfully destroys Daniel's personality and {{wakes up in}} control of his mind and body. Whyte, who thinks she is speaking to Daniel, asks him if he is okay, to which he replies he is keen {{to get back to}} work on the Bridge. As he looks <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror, Daniel sees Leo's reflection looking back at him.|$|E
25|$|Following Duffey's murder, Nilsen {{began to}} kill with {{increasing}} frequency. Before {{the end of}} 1980, he was to kill a further five victims and attempt to murder one other, although {{only one of these}} victims whom Nilsen murdered, 26-year-old William David Sutherland, has ever been identified. Nilsen's recollections of the unidentified victims are vague, although he graphically recalled how each victim had been murdered and just how long the body had been retained before dissection. One unidentified victim killed in November had moved his legs in a cycling motion as he was strangled (Nilsen is known to have absented himself from work between 11 and 18 November, likely due to this particular murder); another unidentified victim Nilsen had unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate, before sinking to his knees and sobbing, before standing to expressly spit at his own image as he looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror. On another occasion, he had lain in bed alongside the body of an unidentified victim as he listened to the classical theme Fanfare for the Common Man before bursting into tears.|$|E
500|$|At the Palmer home, Leland smiles <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror. BOB {{stares back}} {{at him from the}} {{reflection}} and cackles madly. Leland dons a pair of latex gloves. Maddy comes downstairs complaining of a burning smell and sees Sarah unconscious on the floor. She sees Leland grinning at her, then sees BOB appear in Leland's place. She screams in terror and attempts to flee. Leland chases Maddy up the stairs, and drags her to the living room. He strangles and punches her, then taunts and chases her around the living room. He corners her and punches her in the face until she is catatonic. He dances with and cries over her limp body, calling her [...] "Laura," [...] while Bob kisses her. Leland / BOB then becomes enraged and screams, [...] "Leland says you're going back to Missoula, MONTANA!" [...] as he rams her head into a glass picture frame, the words [...] "Missoula, Montana" [...] in the lower corner of the picture. Maddy collapses, bloodied and dead. A crazed Leland places a cutout of the letter [...] "O" [...] under the nail of Maddy's left ring finger.|$|E
60|$|Psmith turned away, {{and resting}} {{his elbows on}} the mantelpiece, gazed <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> mournfully <b>in</b> <b>the</b> looking-glass.|$|R
60|$|Tito, {{laughing}} {{with the rest}} as Nello looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> tragically <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hand-mirror, made a sign of farewell to the company generally, and took his departure.|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] said Psmith, looking <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> earnestly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror, and {{straightening}} his tie, [...] "is {{the exact}} program. We must stake out our claims. This is practical socialism." ...|$|R
60|$|Hurriedly {{pulling off}} his coat, he looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror.|$|E
60|$|Joe turned away, looking <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{mirror as}} he unbuttoned his tunic.|$|E
60|$|Sam squinted <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{glass and}} added a touch of black to his nose.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Harkutt with evident {{reluctance}} {{drew the}} bolts. The wind, still boisterous and besieging, did the rest, and precipitately propelled Peters through the carefully guarded opening. But his surprise <b>at</b> finding <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness seemed to forestall any explanation of his visit.|$|R
60|$|Again Billy {{applied the}} blade to his face. After {{a couple of}} scrapes, he looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> closely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror, grinned, and went on shaving. With {{swiftness}} and dexterity he scraped his face clean of lather. Saxon clapped her hands.|$|R
60|$|So the Detective {{followed}} the Clew {{a whole year}} through a thousand sinuosities, and <b>at</b> last found <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> office of the Morgue.|$|R
60|$|March {{was in fact}} {{somewhat}} astonished <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{light of}} her reasoning; but she went on with some sophistries that restored him to his self-righteousness.|$|E
60|$|She goes out. Augustus {{returns to}} the writing-table smiling, and takes another look <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror. The clerk returns, with his head bandaged, {{carrying}} a poker.|$|E
6000|$|LORD GORING. [Looking <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass.] Donâ€™t think I {{quite like}} this buttonhole, Phipps. Makes me look a little too old. Makes me almost {{in the prime of}} life, eh, Phipps? ...|$|E
60|$|Colonel Howard {{turned in}} amazement, forgetting his angry declamations at this {{unexpected}} intelligence, and beheld, <b>in</b> reality, <b>the</b> sombre visage of his kinsman, who stood holding <b>the</b> door <b>in</b> his hand, apparently as much surprised <b>at</b> finding <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{presence of the}} ladies, as they themselves could be at his unusual visit.|$|R
50|$|Originally from Koroit, Bence was a rover and {{occasional}} forward pocket. He started his league career at South Melbourne but after only one season left for Brighton. His second attempt <b>at</b> establishing <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> VFL was more successful. He played nine seasons for St Kilda, before retiring {{at the age}} of 33.|$|R
60|$|The {{bricklayer}} nearly {{broke out}} again; but, obeying a glance from his wife, closed {{his lips and}} followed her obediently upstairs. Mr. Price, filling his pipe from a paper of tobacco on the mantelpiece, winked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> encouragingly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass, and smiled gently as he heard the chinking of coins upstairs.|$|R
60|$|He {{tried it}} on. There {{was a little}} peal of {{laughter}} from the men. Philippa had ceased her knitting and was watching from the couch. Sir Henry looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> looking-glass.|$|E
60|$|Lessingham looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{glass and}} removed the hat from his head with, some casual observation. He was entirely at his ease. His host turned towards the door, which Mills was holding open.|$|E
6000|$|... "The only trouble is, Jim," [...] he said, peering <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass, [...] "shan't I {{scare the}} boy to death {{directly}} he sees me? Oughtn't I {{to give him some}} sort of warning?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{meeting of}} vessels, or {{the renewal of}} any {{maritime}} experience, never fails to revive my earliest recollections, love. But surely that was an extraordinary being, who has <b>at</b> length shown <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slaver!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Whether {{his good}} friend had <b>at</b> all {{interested}} <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proceedings of our Combined Additional Endowed Dignitaries Committee, and whether it had {{occurred to him that}} to shed a little money in that direction might be a great conception finely executed? ...|$|R
60|$|As a rule he was {{careless}} {{about such}} matters, but to-night no gaoler saw to his bolts and bars more carefully than he did. He {{returned to the}} parlour, having made all secure, and lighting his pipe for a few final whiffs before retiring, winked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> solemnly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass. Then fearful that the housekeeper might return sooner than was expected, he blew out the lamp and smoked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark.|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass. He wore {{no longer}} the well-cut clothes of Mr. Douglas Romilly's Saville Row tailor, but a {{ready-made}} suit of Schmitt & Mayer's business reach-me-downs, an American felt hat and square-toed shoes.|$|E
6000|$|He {{took the}} Browning and the Swinburne {{from the chair}} and kissed them. Just the same, {{she told me to}} call again, he thought. He took another look <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass, and said aloud, with great solemnity:- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Steve, I {{want you}} to tell me something," [...] said Rose to Dandy, who was making faces <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass, while he waited for an answer to the note he brought from his mother to Aunt Plenty.|$|E

6000|$|Claus Hopper {{now made}} his appearance: a simple country lout, full of awe <b>at</b> finding <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> very study of Dr. Knipperhausen, {{and too much}} embarrassed to enter into much detail of the matters that had caused his alarm. He stood twirling his hat in one hand, resting {{sometimes}} on one leg, sometimes on the other, looking occasionally at the doctor, and now and then stealing a fearful glance at the death's-head that seemed ogling him {{from the top of}} the clothes-press; ...|$|R
60|$|When Flammock entered, {{his large}} bulk and massive limbs were strangely contrasted with cheeks pale with horror {{at what he}} had just witnessed, and with awe <b>at</b> finding <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> royal presence-chamber. Beside him stood his prisoner, undaunted by <b>the</b> {{situation}} <b>in</b> which he was placed. The blood of his victim, which had spirited from the wound, was visible on his bare limbs and his scanty garments; but particularly upon his brow and the handkerchief with which it was bound.|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror, {{surprised}} that {{his face had}} not been branded by the hells {{of the past three}} months. The noise of the decks worried him, and he lay down, his tongue only a little pressed against his palate.|$|E
6000|$|Nor did he pause {{until he}} had emerged from the forest and crossed the plains, and reached at last the city from whence he had escaped in the balloon. And, once again in his old lodgings, he looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror and said: ...|$|E
60|$|During the {{progress}} of the foregoing remarks, which Mrs Gamp had addressed exclusively to the barber, Mr Bailey had been tying his cravat, getting on his coat, and making hideous faces <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass. Being now personally addressed by Mrs Gamp, he turned round, and mingled in the conversation.|$|E
