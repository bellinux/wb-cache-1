5|$|The BP Pedestrian Bridge, {{or simply}} BP Bridge, is <b>a</b> <b>girder</b> {{footbridge}} in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois, United States. It spans Columbus Drive to connect Maggie Daley Park (formerly, Daley Bicentennial Plaza) with Millennium Park, both {{parts of the}} larger Grant Park. Designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Frank Gehry, it opened {{along with the rest}} of Millennium Park on July 16, 2004. Gehry had been courted by the city to design the bridge and the neighboring Jay Pritzker Pavilion, and eventually agreed to do so after the Pritzker family funded the Pavilion.|$|E
5|$|In 1840 the Bull Head Turnpike Company built {{a private}} toll road {{known today as}} the Sag Harbor Turnpike, which {{operated}} successfully until a competing railroad line opened in the 1880s. In 1906 the town of Southampton {{took control of the}} now dilapidated road and removed the toll gates. NY114 was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and is known in part as the Sag Harbor Turnpike. The bridge carrying NY114 between Sag Harbor and North Haven is an arched bridge that serves as a village landmark. In 1999, residents successfully fought state proposals to replace it with <b>a</b> <b>girder</b> bridge. Instead, the bridge was replaced with a new, wider bridge with ornamental lamps that closely resembles the original and is in the same location.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} of the {{entrance}} is the subway that links all the platforms, reached either by steps or lift; it houses the main public toilets, automated teller machines (ATM) and several catering outlets (there is catering on all platform islands except 13–15). A passenger information office and lounge are above the subway, the British Transport Police office and cycle racks are beyond, and at the western end is Platform 4, used by only a few trains. Alongside this is Platform 2, another bay platform but not signalled for passenger trains and used only for stabling empty trains, as is the former Motorail unloading bay alongside. At the far end of this track is the old Fish Dock, occasionally used for stabling engineers' on-track equipment. Beyond the end of the platform the tracks swing to the right (the west) and pass out of sight beneath Bath Road Bridge, <b>a</b> <b>girder</b> bridge that carries the A4 out of the city.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> box <b>girder</b> or [...] "tub girder" [...] is, as {{the name}} suggests, a box shape. They consist of two {{vertical}} webs, short top flanges {{on top of each}} web, and a wide bottom flange connecting the webs together. <b>A</b> box <b>girder</b> is particularly resistant to torsion and, while expensive, are utilized in situations where <b>a</b> standard <b>girder</b> might succumb to torsion or toppling effects.|$|R

25|$|Structural {{design was}} {{contracted}} to Johs Holt, with the esthetic aspects {{were designed by}} Lunde og Løvset. Several designs were considered, with a concrete cantilever and a steel box girder the two finalists. The latter would have a smaller profile, with <b>a</b> <b>girder</b> height of , but {{the placement of the}} pillars would force the rerouting of the Såna. The cantilever gave a stiffer construction and higher weight and would also be more dominant in the landscape.|$|E
25|$|Mathieson's part in {{the match}} was curtailed when he fell through a glass roof, to be rescued {{swinging}} from <b>a</b> <b>girder</b> above a 40-foot drop! The Culbertson team won by the decisive, but not overwhelming, margin of 10,900 points (total points scoring). Hubert Phillips, writing in the News Chronicle, put the reasons as superior teamwork, avoidance of unnecessary risks when vulnerable, and greater precision in slam-bidding. The match was analysed in three books, and had a considerable effect on bidding methods in Britain and elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|As soon as two {{adjacent}} columns {{had been}} erected, <b>a</b> <b>girder</b> was hoisted into place {{between them and}} bolted onto the connectors. The columns were erected in opposite pairs, then two more girders were connected to form a self-supporting square—this was the basic frame of each module. The shears would then be moved along and an adjoining bay constructed. When a reasonable number of bays had been completed, the columns for the upper floor were erected (longer shear-legs were used for this, but the operation was {{essentially the same as}} for the ground floor). Once the ground floor structure was complete, the final assembly of the upper floor followed rapidly.|$|E
5000|$|The {{distinction}} in naming between <b>a</b> box <b>girder</b> and <b>a</b> tubular <b>girder</b> is imprecise. Generally the term box girder is used, {{especially if it}} is rectangular in section. Where the girder carries its [...] "content" [...] inside the box, such as the Britannia Bridge, it is termed <b>a</b> tubular <b>girder.</b> Tubular girder is also used if the girder is round or oval in cross-section, such as the Royal Albert Bridge.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s <b>a</b> steel <b>girder</b> {{bridge was}} built to replace the truss bridge. This multi-girder bridge was {{replaced}} in 1996 with <b>a</b> new steel <b>girder</b> bridge.|$|R
40|$|Buckling of <b>a</b> through <b>girder</b> {{generally}} is {{predicted by the}} so called U-frame approach which treats the compressed top flanges as compression members restrained elastically by the web stiffness.

25|$|From Groesbeck, {{the highway}} carries State Route 126 along a path roughly {{parallel}} to the Norwood Lateral, State Route 562, to a junction with Montgomery Road (U.S. Route 22 / State Route 3) in Montgomery. <b>A</b> <b>girder</b> bridge over Hamilton Avenue (U.S. Route 127) in North College Hill is instrumented with over 640 sensors {{to serve as a}} field laboratory for University of Cincinnati researchers and Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) bridge engineers. Ronald Reagan Highway has a complex junction with Interstate 75 in Cincinnati's Roselawn and Hartwell neighborhoods: southbound I-75 traffic must take Galbraith Road through Arlington Heights and Reading to access Ronald Reagan Highway, and westbound Ronald Reagan traffic must use the same route to reach northbound I-75.|$|E
500|$|On 19 October 2008, <b>a</b> <b>girder</b> {{launcher}} {{and a part}} of {{the overhead}} Blue Line extension under construction in Laxmi Nagar, East Delhi, collapsed and fell on passing vehicles underneath. Workers were using a crane to lift a 400-tonne concrete span of the bridge when the launcher collapsed along with a [...] span of the bridge on top of a Blueline bus, killing the driver and a labourer.|$|E
500|$|A {{series of}} {{accidents}} during the tower's construction {{resulted in the}} deaths of six workmen and serious injury to another. Two of the men, Jonathan Richardson and Alexander Stewart, were killed when a crane hook snapped and <b>a</b> <b>girder</b> fell and hit the scaffold platform on which they were standing, causing them to fall to the ground. A third man, John Daly, suffered serious injuries. The other four were killed in separate incidents by falling off the tower structure.

500|$|The present {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Watkin George. George had been trained as a carpenter, but in 1792 became the chief engineer of the ironworks and {{a partner in the}} business. The bridge is composed of two cast iron A-frame trusses supporting a rectangular 2-foot by 6-foot-2-inch cast iron trough. This lower trough carried the Taff Fechan leat and acts as <b>a</b> <b>girder</b> supporting the plates acting as the railway sleepers, into which the rail chairs are integrally cast. [...] Wooden uprights were attached to the iron risers that passed through the apex of each of the A-frames and these supported the upper trough carrying the Taff Fawr leat. Reflecting its designer's roots in carpentry, the members composing the trusses are joined by dovetail and mortise and tenon joints commonly used in wooden structures.|$|E
500|$|The BP Pedestrian Bridge is <b>a</b> <b>girder</b> {{footbridge}} over Columbus Drive {{that connects}} Millennium Park with Maggie Daley Park (formerly, Daley Bicentennial Plaza), both {{parts of the}} larger Grant Park. The pedestrian bridge is the first bridge Gehry designed to be built, and was named for BP plc, which donated $5million {{to the construction of}} the park. It opened on July 16, 2004, {{along with the rest of}} Millennium Park. Gehry had been courted by the city to design the bridge and the neighboring Jay Pritzker Pavilion, and eventually agreed to do so after the Pritzker family funded the Pavilion. [...] The bridge is known for its aesthetics, and Gehry's style is seen in its biomorphic allusions and extensive sculptural use of stainless steel plates to express abstraction. The bridge is referred to as snakelike in character due to its curving form. The bridge's design, which meets highway standards to accommodate rushes of pedestrian traffic simultaneously exiting Pritzker Pavilion events, enables it to bear a heavy load.|$|E
500|$|Construction then shifted south, with {{completion}} from Whitemud Drive {{south to}} 45Avenue {{just north of}} what is currently the Lessard Road interchange. The next section extended the road on twin bridge structures across the North Saskatchewan River to Terwillegar Drive, opening on November8, 2005. In December2003, during construction of the southbound bridge, <b>a</b> <b>girder</b> collapsed {{and had to be}} replaced, delaying construction. [...] An extension further east to Calgary Trail was completed by October2006, creating a full southwest bypass of Edmonton. It includes a semi-circular arch structure that spans Whitemud Creek, and three arch bridges over Blackmud Creek. A $168million interchange that included seven bridges was constructed at Stony Plain Road, and the entire quadrant became free-flowing in late 2011 after the completion of smaller interchanges at Lessard Road, Callingwood Road, and Cameron Heights Drive. A flyover was originally planned on the western leg at 69Avenue before it was ultimately scrapped by Alberta Transportation. The total cost of the entire [...] southwest quadrant from Yellowhead Trail to Gateway Boulevard was $577million.|$|E

500|$|The {{cylindrical}} piers of {{the bridge}} were [...] in diameter and finished with an ashlar of cut granite. The completed bridge had its bascule leaves pivot on trunnions located [...] {{from the end of}} the girders. The bridge's reinforced-concrete counterweights, measuring [...] high by [...] wide, was supported by pivots at the ends of the girders. The trunnions were supported by box-girder posts on the sides of the bascule leaves and each set of inside trunnion posts were braced by <b>a</b> <b>girder</b> ran both between them and to the operating mechanism. Earle Gear and Machine Company provided the operating mechanism for the bridge. The bascule leaves were raised by a motor that used reduction gears and engaged a pinion to move the rack quadrant to raise the bridge. A manual-operation shaft was originally present so that it could be operated from the surface of the roadway, but it was later paved over. The operator's house was located on the south side of the western approach, it originally housed the operator's house and public bathrooms, but it was removed in 1936. The plans originally dictated for a second station on the opposite end, but 1930s photos shows it was apparently never constructed.|$|E
500|$|The {{village of}} Abergynolwyn {{was built to}} house the quarrymen of Bryn Eglwys and their families, and to serve the village an incline with winding house was laid three {{quarters}} of the way along the mineral extension. The winding house for the incline stood on the narrow ledge, with the mineral line passing through it. The two-track incline dropped [...] over a distance of [...] At its foot, the line crossed the Nant Gwernol on <b>a</b> <b>girder</b> bridge. Immediately after the bridge, short lines branched off to the east from a wagon turntable to the coal yard and smithy of Pandy Farm and west to a writing slate factory (later a carpenter's yard). The main branch then split to form a storage loop, with a further wagon turntable and a longer branch serving the houses and school to the north east. The main branch continued north, crossing the main road then passing between the two main terraces in the village before ending in a turntable and a final short line connecting to the Capel Jerusalem chapel. The village incline was lifted {{during the early years of}} preservation, to provide much needed rail to replace the existing track. The winding house was demolished in 1968 to allow realignment of the railway to form the extension to Nant Gwernol.|$|E
500|$|The River Touques has two {{branches}} {{running through}} the town, and the 13th Parachute Battalion were given the objective of establishing a bridgehead across the river. The battalion reached and safely crossed the westernmost branch, but heavy German resistance prevented them from securing {{the main part of}} the town. Overnight a patrol managed to cross the eastern branch, using <b>a</b> <b>girder</b> that had been left spanning the river when the bridge had been blown up. The patrol was then reinforced by 'A' and 'B' Companies, and fought a three-hour battle trying to form a bridgehead. They were then withdrawn back across the river, where the 7th Parachute Battalion had dug in to form a defensive position. At the same time, the 12th Parachute Battalion had tried to cross the river using fords to secure Saint Julien and the nearby railway embankment. They, too, were stopped by heavy German fire, which pinned them down on the embankment, inflicting significant casualties; 16dead and 50wounded. As they were unable to proceed, brigade headquarters called off their attack, but the battalion had to wait until dark to pull back. [...] The next day, 24August, a patrol from the 7th Parachute Battalion discovered that the Germans had withdrawn during the night. The whole brigade crossed the river and advanced unopposed to Bourg, which was secured after a brief fight. The brigade was halted again and the commandos of 1st Special Service Brigade took over the lead. On 26August, to provide some mobility, the Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade was placed under the brigade's command. Together with the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, they headed for Pont Audmer, which was the brigade's final objective. The Dutch were ordered to move with all speed, but arrived 20minutes after the retreating Germans had blown up the bridge across the River Seine, and just before the 7th Parachute Battalion arrived by foot.|$|E

2500|$|Within ten years, {{the station}} was again overcrowded as traffic {{continued}} to increase and further expansion was required. Between 1880 and 1883 the LNWR widened its side of the station and added more platforms which were covered by two extra [...] wide arched spans to the trainshed. At {{the same time the}} MSJ platform was taken out and rebuilt as an island platform on <b>a</b> <b>girder</b> bridge over Fairfield Street. It was linked to the main station by a footbridge.

[...] A tramway had originally been considered for the Rangitikei District, but this plan was abandoned in 1872 and surveys for a railway undertaken in 1873. [...] Contracts were awarded the next year for construction, but mass sickness caused work to slow in 1875 and the collapse of <b>a</b> <b>girder</b> during the construction of a bridge over the Whanganui River in 1876 compounded the delays.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Failure of <b>a</b> ship hull <b>girder</b> is <b>a</b> very {{important}} failure mode, which is normally catastrophic and has severe consequences. It {{is of great}} importance to predict accurately the ultimate strength of <b>a</b> hull <b>girder</b> so that <b>an</b> adequate but not excessive safety margin for this failure can be ensured in the ship design. This study proposes a method for reliability-based analysis of the ultimate strength of <b>a</b> hull <b>girder.</b> The reliability method is interactively integrated with progressive collapse analysis so that the uncertainties in individual random variables relating {{to the prediction of}} the ultimate strength of <b>a</b> hull <b>girder</b> can be accurately considered in reliability analysis and that sensitivity factors of these random variables can be probabilistically evaluated. The ultimate strength will be evaluated using a progressive collapse analysis methodology with the appropriate individual element stress–strain curves derived interactively. The method is applied to two example structures and the sensitivities of the reliability to the random variables are presented...|$|R
