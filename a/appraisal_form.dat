40|$|Abstract Background Rapid {{developments}} {{in intensive care}} medicine have made mechanical ventilation an essential method in the resuscitation and comprehensive treatment of critical care patients. This study aimed to develop and evaluate an <b>appraisal</b> <b>form</b> assessing the clinical effectiveness of adult invasive mechanical ventilation systems. Methods An <b>appraisal</b> <b>form</b> was designed according to the effectiveness evaluation theory of the American Weapons Systems Effectiveness Industry Advisory Committee (WSEIAC) along with literature review and expert panel review. Content validity of the preliminary form was analyzed in a cohort of 200 patients. Exploratory and confirmatory factor {{analysis was used to}} assess <b>appraisal</b> <b>form</b> validity. Discriminate validity of different ventilation outcomes was analyzed by t test. Test/retest reliability and inter-scorer reliability were evaluated with 30 patients after a 2 -week interval by Cronbach's alpha. Results Exploratory factor analysis showed eigenvalues for 3 dimensions (availability, dependability, capability) to be 7. 85, 4. 43, and 4. 22, respectively. Cronbach’s α for internal consistency of the <b>appraisal</b> <b>form</b> was 0. 957, and 0. 922, 0. 961 and 0. 937, respectively, for the 3 dimensions. Test-retest reliability of 3 dimensions was 0. 976, and 0. 862, 0. 857, 0. 885, respectively. Intra-class correlation coefficient verified test-retest reliability; ICC 0. 976 and 0. 862, 0. 857, 0. 885 for 3 dimensions, respectively. Conclusions The <b>appraisal</b> <b>form</b> for clinical effectiveness of adult invasive mechanical ventilation systems has high reliability and validity and may be used in clinical setting. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to gather data {{regarding}} the effectiveness of training in problem solving management by critical analysis. The focus of the study therefore, was to determine if training in problem solving management by critical analysis would increase levels of problem analysis and judgment productivity in a group of administrators. Previous research studies indicate positive relationships between training in problem solving and improved performance of administrators in their task efforts. Twenty-six administrative and supervisory staff members in an urban school district took part in the study. Using a randomized pretest-posttest research design, subjects were divided into an experimental and a control group. The experimental group was exposed to training sessions in problem management by critical analysis based upon writings by Elbing (1978), Drake (1976), Ennis (1962) and Rickards (1974). The control group received no training. All subjects were pretested using the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking <b>Appraisal,</b> <b>Form</b> A. Following the training sessions with the experimental group, all subjects were post-tested using the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking <b>Appraisal,</b> <b>Form</b> B. The Critical Thinking Appraisal Forms A and B thus yielded a numerical score for each of the five subtests on problem analysis and judgment productivity-inference, recognition of assumptions, deduction, interpretation, and evaluation of arguments. A null hypothesis was constructed to deal with experimental and control group comparison and possible differences with the training sessions functioning as the independent variable and the post-test scores functioning as the dependent variable. To determine if gains by any group were significant, a t-test was applied to the data. The. 05 level of confidence was utilized to determine if data were significant. This analysis reported a gain in problem analysis and judgmental productivity in the experimental group and none in the control group. It was therefore concluded that the gain or differences reported in the post-test results, can be directly attributed to the training sessions in problem solving management by critical analysis...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} extent to which clients were able to {{influence}} performance measurement appraisals during the downturn in commercial property markets that began in the UK {{during the second half of}} 2007. The sharp change in market sentiment produced speculation that different client categories were attempting to influence their appraisers in different ways. In particular, it was recognised that the requirement for open-ended funds to meet redemptions gave them strong incentives to ensure that their asset values were marked down to market. Using data supplied by Investment Property Databank, we demonstrate that, indeed, unlisted open ended funds experienced sharper drops in capital values than other fund types in the second half of 2007, after the market turning point. These differences are statistically significant and cannot simply be explained by differences in portfolio composition.

The present study aimed at substantiating the relationship between EFL teachers ’ critical thinking ability and their student-evaluated professional success. To this end, measures of the critical thinking ability of 67 Iranian EFL teachers were obtained using the Farsi version of Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking <b>Appraisal,</b> <b>Form</b> A (WGCTA-FA) (Watson & Glaser, 1980) (Faravani, 2006).

The Pearson product-moment correlation analysis indicated a statistically significant relationship between the two sets of measures (r = 0. 7, p ≤ 0. 05). More specifically, the multiple regression analysis demonstrated that three of the five aspects of critical thinking as defined by Watson and Glaser (1980), namely ‘drawing inferences’, ‘interpreting evidence ’ and ‘evaluating arguments’, are significantly positively correlated with SIET scores. Implications relate to the need to accommodate ‘critical thinking ’ as an essential aspect of EFL teacher education and teacher evaluation programs, and to readdress the concept of EFL/ESL teacher effectiveness with an eye to teachers ’ critical thinking ability...|$|E
