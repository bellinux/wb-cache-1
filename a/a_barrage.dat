Homer keeps his {{anonymity}} while posting more rumors and finds out Mr. Burns plans to sell plutonium to terrorists and is later arrested by the CIA. Eventually, Mr. X wins the Pulitzer Prize for his journalistic achievements, despite nobody knowing who he is. When he hears that the prize money will be given to starving children, Homer reveals that he is Mr. X.|$|E
5|$|Rufus's {{gameplay}} {{has been}} compared to the fighting styles used by Street Fighter III characters Yun and Yang by the development team, notably in regards to his diving kick attack, and emphasized mobility while attacking. Other attacks were designed as a means to negate enemy offensives, such as the Galactic Tornado, which destroys enemy projectiles while drawing the opponent closer to Rufus for a final strike. His Ultra Combo, Space Opera Symphony, is <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> of attacks that requires close proximity to the opponent, dealing several blows and ending in a final upwards blast.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> {{standing}} <b>barrage</b> was {{static and}} might be defensive, to inhibit the movement of enemy troops and break up attacks. <b>A</b> creeping <b>barrage</b> {{could be made to}} stand on a line for a time before it moved on, perhaps waiting for the infantry to form up behind it, or to catch up, or perhaps it would stand on the line of known enemy defences, to do more damage and sap enemy morale. The fireplan for the Battle of Messines on 7 June 1917 called for most of the 18-pounder field guns to fire <b>a</b> creeping <b>barrage</b> of shrapnel immediately ahead of the advance, while the other field guns and 4.5 inch howitzers fired <b>a</b> standing <b>barrage</b> some 700 yd ahead.|$|R

5|$|The Austrians briefly {{took the}} {{advantage}} {{when they moved}} a battery from the ridge north of the village to cover their infantry; the fire from the battery allowed the infantry to deploy {{at right angles to}} their original front. Frederick responded by ordering the last of his reserved left wing to advance, but the Austrian battery drove it back. Finally, Frederick's heavy cannons on the Butterberg, a small knoll to the west of town, laid down <b>a</b> <b>barrage.</b> Some participants said it was this barrage, more than the Prussian infantry, which won the battle.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealanders' {{defensive}} positions {{had been}} improved despite {{the weather and}} the harassment from German artillery, which killed Fulton, the original commander of the Rifle Brigade, when <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> targeted his headquarters. The division undertook the first offensive action by the British forces during the Spring Offensive when three battalions seized the high ground of La Signy farm on 30 March. This success, although relatively trivial to the New Zealanders, was a morale booster {{for the rest of the}} beleaguered Third Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{policies of the}} New Deal leaders were often aligned with ACLU goals, but social goals were not. In particular, movies were subject to <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> of local ordinances banning screenings that were deemed immoral or obscene. Even public health films portraying pregnancy and birth were banned; as was Life magazine's April 11, 1938 issue which included photos of the birth process. The ACLU fought these bans, but did not prevail.|$|E
50|$|In <b>a</b> box <b>barrage</b> {{three or}} four <b>barrages</b> formed <b>a</b> box—or more often three sides of a box—around a {{position}} to isolate it. Standing or box barrages were often used for Defensive Fire tasks, in which the barrage was registered beforehand, on a position agreed with the defending infantry commander, to be called down {{in the event of}} an enemy attack on his positions. <b>A</b> box <b>barrage</b> could also be used to prevent the enemy from reinforcing a position to be attacked. In a trench raid of March 1917, 1st Battalion the Buffs were supported first by <b>a</b> creeping <b>barrage,</b> then by <b>a</b> box <b>barrage</b> once they were in the enemy trenches, to prevent German reinforcement or counter-attack, plus dummy bombardments on other sections of the line to confuse the enemy.|$|R

5|$|At first, {{tenacious}} KPA defense {{halted the}} Marines who responded with artillery, raking Cloverleaf Hill. Heavy indirect fire forced the North Koreans {{out of their}} positions before the Marines and Task Force Hill eventually overwhelmed them, one hill at a time. The Marines approached Obong-ni first, destroying resistance on the slope with an airstrike and <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> from US tanks, but strong resistance caused heavy casualties, {{and they had to}} withdraw. The 18th North Korean Regiment, in control of the hill, mounted a disastrous counterattack in hopes of pushing the Marines back. The division's tactics of cutting off supplies and relying on surprise, which had provided them so much success up to this point, failed in the face of massive US numerical superiority.|$|E

5|$|Miller {{played a}} vital role in the side's success in the Test series, {{particularly}} with the ball. Despite a back injury which meant he passed one Test without bowling, he took 13 wickets in the series at an average of 26.28, and also contributed 184 runs at an average of 23.15. He {{played a key role in}} subduing England's leading batsmen, Len Hutton and Denis Compton, with <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> of short-pitched bowling, troubling Hutton to such an extent that he was dropped for the Third Test. In all first-class matches on the tour, Miller scored 1,088 runs at 47.30 and took 56 wickets at 17.58. Bradman gave him a light bowling workload during the tour matches, to keep him fresh for the Test matches.|$|E

5|$|The Maratha cannonade {{intensified}} as the British redeployed. Although British artillery {{was brought}} forward to counter, it was ineffective against the mass firepower of the Maratha guns and quickly disabled through {{the weight of}} shot directed against it. British casualties mounted as the Maratha guns {{turned their attention to}} the infantry and subjected them to <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> of canister, grape and round shot. Wellesley decided that his only option to neutralise the artillery and get his men out of the killing field was to advance directly into the mouth of the Maratha artillery. He ordered his cannon to be abandoned and gave the command for his infantry to march forward with bayonets fixed.|$|E
5|$|The V-2 rocket was one {{of several}} {{innovative}} long-range weapons developed by the Germans after the failure of the Luftwaffe to strike a decisive blow against Britain. It was a revolutionary weapon – the world's first operational SRBM – that had been developed in a secret programme begun in 1936. The German leadership hoped that <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> of rockets unleashed against London would force Britain out of the war. Although Adolf Hitler was at first ambivalent, he eventually became an enthusiastic supporter of the V-2 programme as Allied air forces carried out increasingly devastating attacks on German cities.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} clergyman who {{was also}} a politician, Horne had a burgeoning {{business}} career with Triplex Safety Glass, which was interrupted by service with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. While serving in <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> balloon unit, he was asked to broadcast as a quizmaster on the BBC radio show Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer. The experience brought him into contact with the more established entertainer Richard Murdoch, and the two wrote and starred in the comedy series Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh. After demobilisation Horne returned to his business career, and kept his broadcasting as a sideline. His career in industry flourished, and he later became the chairman and managing director of toy manufacturers Chad Valley.|$|E

5|$|Once the {{infantry}} {{had reached the}} German trenches, the artillery shifted from the creeping barrage to the standing <b>barrage,</b> <b>a</b> static <b>barrage</b> that would protect {{the infantry}} from counter-attack while they consolidated the position. A variant was the box barrage, in which three or four <b>barrages</b> formed <b>a</b> box—or more often three sides of a box—around a position to isolate and prevent reinforcements being brought up into the front line. This was normally used to protect trench raids, although {{it could also be}} used offensively against a German unit. Another type of barrage was the SOS barrage, fired in response to a German counterattack. An SOS barrage could be brought down by firing a flare signal of a pre arranged colour, as <b>a</b> German <b>barrage</b> tended to cut the telephone lines. <b>A</b> pre-registered <b>barrage</b> would then descend on No Man's Land.|$|R

5|$|Throughout 8 April, the Australians were {{subjected}} to heavy shellfire from German forces. At approximately 22:00, the Germans launched a fierce counter-attack {{under the cover of}} <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> of bombs and trench mortars against A Company's position at the mill. They had some initial success and entered the forward posts of the mill, which were occupied by a platoon of Newland's men under the command of Sergeant John Whittle. Newland, bringing up a platoon from the battalion's reserve company, charged the attackers and re-established the lost ground with Whittle's assistance. The 12th Battalion was relieved by the 11th Battalion on 10 April, having succeeded in capturing Boursies at the cost of 240 casualties, of which 70 were killed or missing.|$|E
5|$|Until 1914, {{artillery}} generally fired over open sights at visible targets, {{the largest}} unit accustomed to firing {{at a single}} target was the artillery regiment or brigade. One innovation {{brought about by the}} adoption of trench warfare was the barrage—a term first used in the battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915. Trench warfare had created the need for indirect fire, with the use of observers, more sophisticated artillery fire plans, and an increasingly scientific approach to gunnery, where artillerymen had to use increasingly complicated calculations to lay the guns. Individual guns were aimed so that their fall of shot was coordinated with others to form a pattern; in the case of <b>a</b> <b>barrage,</b> the pattern was a line.|$|E
5|$|When the {{restoration}} of the Sistine Chapel was announced, it sparked <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> of queries and objections from art historians around the world. One of the most vocal of these critics was James Beck, of ArtWatch International, who issued repeated warnings about the possibility of damage to Michelangelo's work from over-strenuous restoration. An argument that was used repeatedly was that all the previous interventions had caused damage of one sort or another. Any restoration, as opposed to conservation, puts an artwork at risk. Conservation, on the other hand, aids in the preservation of the work in its present state and in prevention of further deterioration. Beck has written about his concerns in Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} a favourable omen {{during the night}} Pyrrhus renewed his assault. An effect of the shortage of warriors was that the Spartan women were active in providing the defenders with missiles and refreshments as well as taking away the wounded. In an attempt to nullify the Spartans' advantage, the Epiriotes tried to fill up with trench with debris and bodies but were prevented from doing so by the Sparta. Responding to this Spartan counter-attack, Pyrrhus personally led a charge against the Spartan lines and succeeded in entering the city, spreading panic amongst the defenders. However, at this point his horse threw him after it was wounded by a javelin in the belly. Pyrrhus' fall threw his companions {{into a state of}} dismay, permitting the Spartans to rally and they managed to slay many of the companions in <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> of missiles. Despite this, Pyrrhus was taken safely back to his camp.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards the SEES members {{break into}} the school and indeed find Fuka inside Tartarus when the Dark Hour strikes. However when Akihiko pieces {{together}} {{the connection between the}} full moon and the powerful Shadows, Mitsuru and Yukari come under attack by the Emperor and Empress Arcanas at Tartarus' entrance. Junpei, Akihiko and Fuka rush to their aid however the Arcanas easily overwhelm all of their Personas. In the midst of the battle, Fuka also awakens a Persona, Lucia, to defend an entranced Natsuki. However when the Emperor moves to attack her, Makoto arrives {{in the nick of time}} and launches <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> of Persona attacks despite his teammates begging him to flee for his safety. With everyone approaching their physical limits, Fuka uses Lucia to sense the Arcanas' weaknesses and coordinates the SEES members in a collaborative effort which results in the Shadows' defeat. A few days later, Fuka moves into the Iwatodai dorm and repairs her relations with Natsuki, while life returns to a level of normalcy.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Spartan counter-attack against the Epiriotes filling the trench, Pyrrhus decided to personally lead a charge against the Spartan lines. Mounted on his horse, the Epiriote King was able to force his away through the trench, over the wagons and into the city {{with a group of}} his companions. The sudden onslaught of Pyrrhus sparked panic amongst the defenders of this section. At this point Pyrrhus' horse was wounded by a javelin which pierced its belly causing it to throw the King to the ground. The fall of the King threw his companions into a state of confusion and enabled the Spartans to rally. The Spartans launched <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> of missiles at the King's comrades, felling many of them. Despite the deaths of many of his guards, Pyrrhus was successfully taken to the safety of the main Epiriote lines.|$|E
