500|$|Mega Man X {{takes place}} in an {{unspecified}} time during the 22nd century (2120) and approximately 100 years after the original Mega Man series. A human archaeologist named Dr. Cain discovers {{the ruins of a}} robotics research facility that had once been operated by the legendary robot designer Dr. Thomas Light. Among the ruins, Cain finds a large capsule which contains a highly <b>advanced</b> <b>robot</b> with human-level intelligence and emotions, and even free will, the likes of which the world has never seen before. Light had wished to instill within his creation reasonable sanity, good nature, and an understanding of the more controversial aspects of human morality. The robot was buried while running a 30-year diagnostic program to ensure these features. Cain spends the next several months studying the robot, who is named Mega Man X, or simply [...] "X". Cain decides to duplicate X and, within several months, completes the first [...] "replicate android" [...] or [...] "Reploid", a robot who can think, feel, learn, and grow exactly like a human. Within the year, the design is standardized and Reploids are mass-produced. However, with the free will given to a Reploid comes the possibility of criminal activity; such rogue Reploids are branded as [...] "Mavericks" [...] by law-abiding citizens.|$|E
2500|$|The book's central {{crime is}} a murder, {{which takes place}} before the novel opens.

[...] The victim is Roj Nemmenuh Sarton, a Spacer Ambassador who lives in Spacetown, the Spacer outpost just outside New York City. For some time, {{he has tried to}} convince the Earth government to loosen its anti-robot restrictions. One morning, he is discovered outside his home, his chest imploded by an energy blaster. The New York police commissioner charges Elijah with finding the murderer, in cooperation with a highly <b>advanced</b> <b>robot</b> named R. Daneel Olivaw who is visually identical to a human, and is equipped with a scanner that is able to detect human emotions through their encephalographic waves.|$|E

40|$|In {{attempting}} to build <b>advanced</b> <b>robots</b> with sophisticated intelligent behaviors, the modern roboticist {{does not have}} to look far to find examples of such behavior. Humans are, and for the foreseeable future remain our best and only example of true intelligence. In comparison, even <b>advanced</b> <b>robots</b> are still embarrassingly stupid. Consequently, one popular approach for imparting intelligent behaviors to robots and other machines abstracts models of human control strategy (HCS), learned directly from human control data. This type of approach can be broadly classified as "learning through observation. " A competing approach, which builds up complex behaviors through exploration and optimization over time, is reinforcement learning. We seek to unite these two approaches, previously considered disparate, and show that each approach, in fact, complements the other. Specifically, we propose a new algorithm, rooted in reinforcement learning, for stabilizing learned models of human control strate [...] ...|$|R
