5|$|Additionally, genes {{can have}} {{regulatory}} regions many kilobases upstream or downstream {{of the open}} reading frame that alter expression. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.|$|E
5|$|P. acnes also provokes skin {{inflammation}} {{by altering}} the fatty composition of oily sebum. Oxidation of the lipid squalene by P. acnes {{is of particular}} importance. Squalene oxidation activates NF-κB (a protein complex) and consequently increases IL-1α levels. Additionally, squalene oxidation leads to increased activity of the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme responsible for conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotriene B4 (LTB4). LTB4 promotes skin inflammation by acting on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) protein. PPARα increases activity of <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> 1 (AP-1) and NF-κB, thereby leading to the recruitment of inflammatory T cells. The inflammatory properties of P. acnes can be further explained by the bacterium's ability to convert sebum triglycerides to pro-inflammatory free fatty acids via secretion of the enzyme lipase. These free fatty acids spur production of cathelicidin, HBD1, and HBD2, thus leading to further inflammation.|$|E

Here we report the discovery of an “anti-α” factor Spx in Bacillus subtilis that blocks transcriptional activation by binding to the α-C-terminal domain, thereby interfering with the capacity of RNAP to respond to certain <b>activator</b> <b>proteins.</b> Spx disrupts complex formation between the <b>activator</b> <b>proteins</b> ResD and ComA and promoter-bound RNAP, and it does so by direct {{interaction with the}} α-subunit. ResD- and ComA-stimulated transcription requires the proteolytic elimination of Spx by the ATP-dependent protease ClpXP.

25|$|In {{positive}} inducible operons, activator proteins {{are normally}} unable to bind to the pertinent DNA. When an inducer is {{bound by the}} <b>activator</b> <b>protein,</b> it undergoes a change in conformation {{so that it can}} bind to the DNA and activate transcription.|$|E
25|$|GM2A is {{expressed}} in many tissues, and the GM2 <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> {{has been reported to}} have other cellular functions. Because AB variant is so rarely diagnosed, it is likely that most mutations of GM2A are fatal at the embryionic or fetal stage of development in homozygotes and genetic compounds, and thus are never observed clinically.|$|E
40|$|The binding of TATA-binding protein (TBP) to the TATA {{element is}} the first step in the {{initiation}} of RNA polymerase II transcription from many promoters in vitro. It has been proposed that upstream <b>activator</b> <b>proteins</b> stimulate transcription by recruiting TBP to the promoter, thus facilitating the assembly of a transcription complex. However, the role of <b>activator</b> <b>proteins</b> acting at this step to stimulate transcription in vivo remains largely speculative. To test whether recruitment of TBP to the promoter is sufficient for transcriptional activation in vivo, we constructed a hybrid protein containing TBP of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL 4. Our results show that TBP recruited by the GAL 4 DNA-binding domain to promoters bearing a GAL 4 -binding site can interact with the TATA element and direct high levels of transcription. This finding indicates that binding of TBP to promoters in S. cerevisiae is a major rate-limiting step accelerated by upstream <b>activator</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R

40|$|The role of {{the alpha}} subunit of Escherichia coli RNA {{polymerase}} in transcription activation by positive factors was investigated using two reconstituted mutant RNA polymerases (containing C-terminally truncated alpha subunits) and three positive factors [the cAMP receptor protein (CRP), OmpR, and PhoB].

Transcription by these mutant enzymes was, however, activated in the cases where activators bind to target sites that overlap the promoter - 35 region.

25|$|Both the {{catalytic}} subunits of DDK and Cdc7, and the <b>activator</b> <b>protein,</b> Dbf4, are conserved in eukaryotes and {{are required}} for the onset of S phase of the cell cycle. Both DDK and Cdc7 {{are required for}} the loading of Cdc45 onto chromatin origins of replication. The target for binding of the DDK kinase is the Mcm complex, possibly Mcm2. DDK targets the Mcm complex, and its phosphorylation leads to the possible activation of Mcm helicase activity.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{degradation}} {{occurs in}} the lysosomes. Here, arylsulfatase A hydrolyzes the sulfate group. However, in order for this reaction to be carried out, a sphingolipid <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> such as saposin B must be present. Saposin B extracts sulfatide from the membrane, which makes it accessible to arylsulfatase A. Arylsulfatase A can then hydrolyze the sulfate group. Accumulation of sulfatide can cause metachromatic leukodystrophy, a lysosomal storage disease and may be caused because of a defect in arylsulfatase A, leading to an inability to degrade sulfatide.|$|E
40|$|The Mediator {{complex is}} the major multiprotein {{transcriptional}} coactivator complex in Drosophila melanogaster. Mediator components interact with diverse sets of transcriptional <b>activator</b> <b>proteins</b> to elicit the sophisticated regulation of gene expression. The distinct phenotypes associated with certain mutations {{in some of the}} Mediator genes and the specific in vitro interactions of Mediator gene products with transcriptional <b>activator</b> <b>proteins</b> suggest the presence of activator-specific binding subunits within the Mediator complex. However, the physiological relevance of these selective in vitro interactions has not been addressed. Therefore, we analyzed dTRAP 80, one of the putative activator-binding subunits of the Mediator, for specificity of binding to a number of natural transcriptional activators from Drosophila. Among the group of <b>activator</b> <b>proteins</b> that requires the Mediator complex for transcriptional activation, only a subset of these proteins interacted with dTRAP 80 in vitro and only these dTRAP 80 -interacting activators were defective for activation under dTRAP 80 -deficient in vivo conditions. In particular, activation of Drosophila antimicrobial peptide drosomycin gene expression by the NF-κB-like transcription factor Dif during induction of the Toll signaling pathway was dependent on the dTRAP 80 module. These results, and the indirect support from the dTRAP 80 artificial recruitment assay, indicate that dTRAP 80 serves as a genuine activator-binding target responsible for a distinct group of activators...|$|R

50|$|Because protein kinases have {{profound}} effects on a cell, their activity is highly regulated.

25|$|The {{hydrolysis}} of GM2-ganglioside requires three proteins. Two of {{them are}} subunits of hexosaminidasenbsp&A; the third is a small glycolipid transport protein, the GM2 <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> (GM2A), which acts as a substrate-specific cofactor for the enzyme. Deficiency {{in any one of}} these proteins leads to ganglioside storage, primarily in the lysosomes of neurons. Tay–Sachs disease (along with AB-variant GM2-gangliosidosis and Sandhoff disease) occurs because a mutation inherited from both parents deactivates or inhibits this process. Most Tay–Sachs mutations probably do not directly affect protein functional elements (e.g., the active site). Instead, they cause incorrect folding (disrupting function) or disable intracellular transport.|$|E
2500|$|Caspases [...] {{play the}} {{central role in the}} {{transduction}} of ER apoptotic signals. Caspases are proteins that are highly conserved, cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases. There are two types of caspases: initiator caspases, caspase 2,8,9,10,11,12, and effector caspases, caspase 3,6,7. The activation of initiator caspases requires binding to specific oligomeric <b>activator</b> <b>protein.</b> Effector caspases are then activated by these active initiator caspases through proteolytic cleavage. The active effector caspases then proteolytically degrade a host of intracellular proteins to carry out the cell death program.|$|E
2500|$|The {{involvement}} of cyclic nucleotides on biological functions is varied, while {{an understanding of}} their role continues to grow. There are several examples of their biological influence. They are associated with long-term and short-term memory. [...] They also work in the liver to coordinate various enzymes that control blood glucose and other nutrients. In bacteria, cyclic nucleotides bind to catabolite gene <b>activator</b> <b>protein</b> (CAP), which acts to increase metabolic enzymatic activity by increasing the rate of DNA transcription. They also facilitate relaxation of smooth muscle cells in vascular tissue, and activate cyclic CNG channels in retinal photoreceptors and olfactory sensory neurons. In addition, they potentially activate cyclic CNG channels in: pineal gland light sensitivity, sensory neurons of the vomeronasal organ (which {{is involved in the}} detection of pheromones), taste receptor cells, cellular signaling in sperm, airway epithelial cells, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-secreting neuronal cell line, and renal inner medullary collecting duct.|$|E
50|$|An {{enhancer}} may {{be located}} upstream or downstream {{of the gene}} it regulates. Furthermore, an enhancer doesn't need to be located near the transcription initiation site to affect transcription, as some have been found located in several hundred thousand base pairs upstream or downstream of the start site. Enhancers do not act on the promoter region itself, but are bound by <b>activator</b> <b>proteins.</b> These <b>activator</b> <b>proteins</b> interact with the mediator complex, which recruits polymerase II and the general transcription factors which then begin transcribing the genes. Enhancers {{can also be found}} within introns. An enhancer's orientation may even be reversed without affecting its function. Additionally, an enhancer may be excised and inserted elsewhere in the chromosome, and still affect gene transcription. That is one reason that introns polymorphisms may have effects although they are not translated. Enhancers can also be found at the exonic region of an unrelated gene and they may act on genes on another chromosome.|$|R
