50|$|Raw Recruits, a {{book that}} took a {{critical}} look at the UK program, noted {{that there was an}} empty seat between all students, and that Shearer was right-handed and sitting to Manuel's left. The book's authors, Alexander Wolff and <b>Armen</b> <b>Keteyian,</b> said that Manuel would have had to look over an empty space and Shearer's right arm to copy off of himâ€”something that would not (or should not) have gone unnoticed by Shearer, the five proctors for the test, or other students sitting near them. Shearer reportedly boasted that he'd helped Manuel get into Kentucky. Ed Dove, the public defender who represented Manuel in the NCAA case, believes that Manuel may have been tripped up by signing two answer sheets. He believes Manuel took the test honestly on one, but someone elseâ€”without Manuel's knowledgeâ€”copied Shearer's answers on the second and sent it to ACT headquarters in Iowa City.|$|E
5000|$|In the May 12, 1986 {{issue of}} Sports Illustrated, an article was {{published}} alleging more {{problems with the}} off-ice activities of the Oilers. The article, written by <b>Armen</b> <b>Keteyian</b> and Donald Ramsay, suggested that five team members had [...] "substantial" [...] cocaine problems. Citing sources from around the league and from the RCMP's Edmonton Drug Unit, alleges rampant drug use within the team, a high-pressure citywide environment that put immense pressure on players, and a culture of ensuring the players' drinking problems remained under wraps. The financial problems of certain players were also brought up, most notably those of Grant Fuhr. The Hockey News ran a responding article in which Sather called the allegations innuendo. NHL President John Ziegler and NHLPA President Alan Eagleson dismissed the story as McCarthyism. Sports Illustrated stood by its story; suddenly, the Oilers' organization had an image problem to fight. After already being tarnished by the Messier and Hunter episodes in the last year, they were now widely suspected of rampant drug use.|$|E

5000|$|Barrett, a singer-songwriter from Michigan, was {{inspired}} to write the song in 1986 while watching Larry Bird play on TV at a bar called the Varsity Inn in East Lansing, Michigan, after having played a gig there. He wrote the song down on a napkin the next day, later stating that [...] "the song came fully formed" [...] and [...] "all the lyrics just wrote themselves." [...] He passed the song along to high school friend <b>Armen</b> <b>Keteyian,</b> an investigative journalist for CBS Sports and, at that time, Sports Illustrated, who in turn passed it to CBS Sports Creative Director Doug Towey. However, Towey originally planned to debut the song not after a basketball game, but after a football game, Super Bowl XXI. It {{was to have been}} the post-game montage from that contest, but CBS ran past the expected airtime and had a primetime show to debut in the next time slot, so the montage was canceled. CBS then asked Barrett for use of the song after the 1987 NCAA championship game, in which Indiana beat Syracuse. Towey decided to use [...] "One Shining Moment" [...] to close CBS's coverage of the Tournament. The positive public response led to it becoming an annual feature.|$|E
