40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} investigation into the effect of nanoparticle fillers and a polydopamine <b>adhesive</b> <b>primer</b> on the tribological performance of thin PTFE films. The principal objective of this investigation was to reduce wear in PTFE films, an issue which precludes the use of PTFE films in tribological applications requiring high durability. The friction and wear of the composite films were evaluated using a ball-on-flat configuration in linear reciprocating motion. It was found that the use of a polydopamine <b>adhesive</b> <b>primer</b> reduces the wear of PTFE films more than 600 times. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results show that a tenacious layer of PTFE remains adhered to the polydopamine primer, which enables the durability of the polydopamine/PTFE film. Furthermore, the combination of a polydopamine primer, Cu nanoparticle fillers in the PTFE film, and optimal fabrication processes provided a collective effect that increased the wear life of PTFE films by more than 940 times. Because of the relatively low thickness of the film, it shows great potential for use in applications where durable, thin films are desirable...|$|E

40|$|Statement of Problem: The {{viscosity}} of orthodontics adhesive primers is cru- cial {{for stability}} and correct brackets ‘position during bond up. An excessive adhesive flow during brackets seating {{could change the}} brackets’ position. Objectives: The main {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the viscosity of four orthodontic adhesive primers in two different temperatures. Materials and Methods: Four orthodontic adhesive primers were used in this study. They include Transbond self-etching primer (SEP; 3 M Unitek, USA), Transbond XT (3 M Unitek, USA), Transbond moisture insensitive prim- er (MIP; 3 M Unitek, USA), and Unite <b>adhesive</b> <b>primer</b> (3 M Unitek, USA). A controlled stress rheometer (Carri-Med MKII, UK) with truncated cone and plate were used to investigate the viscosity of each orthodontic <b>adhesive</b> <b>primer</b> in two different temperatures. The orthodontic adhesive primers were tested at 25 °C and 35 °C for five times to calculate the means for each mate- rial during ascent and descent of the controlled stress rheometer. Statistical analysis was done with one-way ANOVA and two-sample t-test. Results: In this study, a statistically significant difference was found among viscosity of different orthodontic adhesive primers (p = 0. 005). At 25 °C, the Transbond XT (192. 20 ± 1. 21 MPa·s) was the most viscous primer and Transbond MIP (21. 74 ± 1. 50 MPa·s) the least viscous one. Unite <b>adhesive</b> <b>primer</b> (143. 40 ± 2. 17 MPa·s) was the second most viscous primer followed by Transbond SEP (44. 28 ± 3. 09 MPa·s). The difference of the viscosity of orthodontic adhesive primers was also statistically significant when compared in two different temperatures. Conclusions: This study showed that there was a statistically significant difference among the viscosity of the four orthodontic adhesive primers. Moreover, the viscosity of orthodontic adhesive primers also changed with temperatures. This might affect the orthodontic bond up procedure during summer and winter...|$|E

Translation of mussel-inspired wet adhesion typically entails catechol functionalization of polymers and/or polyelectrolytes, and solution processing of many complex components and steps that require optimization and stabilization. Here we reduced the complexity of a wet <b>adhesive</b> <b>primer</b> to synthetic low-molecular-weight catecholic zwitterionic surfactants that show very strong adhesion (B 50 mJm 2) and retain the ability to coacervate.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this {{in-vitro}} study was to evaluate the effects of three different surface preparation methods on the shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets bonded to zirconia and determine the most appropriate method. Methods: 45 zirconia and 30 leucite-reinforced porcelain mandibular premolar crowns were divided into 5 groups and received the following surface preparations: 37 % phosphoric acid and non-hydrolyzed silane, 4 % hydrofluoric acid and hydrolyzed silane, microetch with 50 μ Al 2 O 3 particles. A universal <b>adhesive</b> <b>primer</b> containing MDP was applied and the brackets were bonded with a bis-GMA composite resin. Shear bond strength (SBS) at bond failure and ARI score were recorded. Results: There was {{a statistically significant difference}} among the studied groups for the SBS. The highest mean SBS (11. 03 MPA) was recorded for the zirconia/microetch group, and the lowest SBS (3. 49 MPa) for the zirconia/phosphoric acid group. The leucite-reinforced porcelain/ hydrofluoric acid group had significantly more fractures than any other debond pattern. The zirconia/hydrofluoric acid group was the only one with a SBS (8. 08 MPa) that fell within the recommended range of 6 - 8 MPa. This group also had a favorable debond pattern with most composite remaining on the bracket. Conclusions: Important consideration should be given to the surface preparation of porcelain and zirconia prior to bonding orthodontic attachments. Phosphoric acid etch is not an adequate surface preparation when bonding to zirconia. Hydrofluoric acid is not suitable when bonding to leucite-reinforced porcelain, as it is associated with a higher rate of surface fracture. Microetch with 50 μ Al 2 O 3 particles in combination with an MDP containing universal <b>adhesive</b> <b>primer</b> provided optimal mean shear bond strength, along with favorable debond patterns when bonding to zirconia. Hydrofluoric acid etch in combination with a silane and a universal primer containing MDP provided acceptable shear bond strength to zirconia. This protocol was not significantly different from zirconia prepared with microetch and either method can be successfully employed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cords have {{commonly}} {{been used}} as reinforcing materials in rubber composites. To improve cord/rubber interfacial adhesion, the cords are usually coated with an adhesive (typically based on Resorcinol-Formaldehyde-Latex (RFL)). These cord/rubber composites {{have been used in}} many sectors such as the tire, hose and belt industries. Inter-facial adhesion between cord and rubber is an important determinant of the durability of the composite system. In this study, newly developed polyketone cord was coated by dipping in various RFL-based adhesive primers and then bonded to natural rubber by a compression molding method. The resin/latex ratio in the RFL <b>adhesive</b> <b>primer</b> was var-ied in order to achieve the optimal mixing ratio. Polyketone cord was treated with primers at various heating tempera-tures and dipping times. To measure the adhesion strength between the polyketone cord and the natural rubber, and the fatigue resistance of the composite system, the H-test and the tension-compression test were performed.

40|$|Adhesive {{procedures}} activate dentin-associated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and so iatrogenically initiate bond degradation. We {{hypothesized that}} adding MMP inhibitors to <b>adhesive</b> <b>primers</b> may prevent this endogenous enzymatic degradation, thereby improving bond durability. A nonspecific MMP inhibitor (chlorhexidine) and a MMP- 2 / 9 -specific inhibitor (SB- 3 CT) were admixed to the primers of an etch & rinse and a self-etch adhesive, both considered as gold-standard adhesives within their respective categories. For dentin powder {{exposed to the}} adhesives under clinical application conditions, gelatin zymography revealed the release of MMP- 2 (not of MMP- 9) by the etch & rinse adhesive, while no release of enzymes could be detected for the mild self-etch adhesive, most likely because of its limited dentin demineralization effect. The built-in MMP inhibitors appeared effective in reducing bond degradation only for the etch & rinse adhesive, {{and not for the}} self-etch adhesive. Water sorption of adhesive interfaces most likely remains the principal mechanism of bond degradation, while endogenous enzymes appear to contribute to bond degradation of only etch & rinse adhesives. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the extent of}} water penetration through resin-dentin interfaces before and after being sealed with adhesives. Four adhesive resin systems (2 total-etch adhesives and 2 self-etching <b>primer</b> <b>adhesives)</b> were used in this study. Dentin disks were placed in a split-chamber device, and in situ fluid movement across dentin was measured, with and without physiological pressure, during bonding procedures or 24 hrs after bonding. The fluid movement across dentin occurs via dentin tubules after acid-etching. Large outward or inward fluid shifts across dentin were observed during air-drying and light-curing for resin application. The amount of fluid movement across resin-bonded dentin when total-etch adhesives were used was significantly greater than that with self-etching adhesives. The milder acidetching effects of self-etching primers may retain hybridized smear plugs within the tubules that reduce outward fluid flow, resulting in superior dentin sealing.

40|$|Standard peel {{tests for}} {{aerospace}} laminates based on metal–polymer systems, namely floating-roller and climbing-drum peel methods, have been accommodated in a unified theory of peeling. This theory also accommodates more basic peel tests such as T-peel and fixed-arm peel and also newer {{methods such as}} mandrel peel. These five methods have been applied to two aerospace laminate systems to critically examine their use in the determination of adhesive strength. The theory {{has been used to}} unify the outputs from the tests in terms of adhesive fracture toughness. In this way, the comparative merits of the methods can be commented on. The validity of the standard methods has been put in doubt because of the absence of a correction for plastic bending energy and also because of the poor conformance of the peel arm to the roller system used in these methods. The unified theory and some measurements of peel-arm curvature help but not completely overcome some of these difficulties. A further complication that arises in peel is a change in the plane of fracture. This reflects a transition from cohesive fracture in the adhesive to an adhesive fracture at the interfaces among <b>adhesive,</b> <b>primer,</b> and substrate. It is likely that such plane-of-fracture phenomena are intrinsic to evaluation of the laminate and that contemplation of cohesive fracture toughness for the adhesive cannot accommodate such events...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Orthodontic {{treatment}} with fixed brackets {{plays a major}} role on the formation of white spot lesions. Objective This study aimed to incorporate silver nanoparticle solutions (AgNP) in an orthodontic adhesive and evaluate its physicochemical and antimicrobial properties. Material and Methods Silver nanoparticle solutions were added to a commercial adhesive in different concentrations (w/w) : 0 %, 0. 11 %, 0. 18 %, and 0. 33 %. Shear bond strength (SBS) test was performed after bonding metal brackets to enamel. Raman spectroscopy was used to analyze in situ the degree of conversion (DC) of the adhesive layer. The surface free energy (SFE) was evaluated after the measurement of contact angles. Growth inhibition of Streptococcus mutans in liquid and solid media was determined by colony-forming unit count and inhibition halo, respectively. One-way ANOVA was performed for SBS, DC, SFE, and growth inhibition. Results The incorporation of AgNP solution decreased the SBS (p< 0. 001) and DC in situ (p< 0. 001) values. SFE decreased after addition of 0. 18 % and 0. 33 % AgNP. Growth inhibition of S. mutans in liquid media was obtained after silver addition (p< 0. 05).
