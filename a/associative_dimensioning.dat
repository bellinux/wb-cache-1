Because existing operationalizations of issue ownership tap only the former dimension, we focus on associative issue ownership: the spontaneous identification between specific issues and specific parties {{in the minds of}} voters. Survey evidence from Belgium shows that the <b>associative</b> <b>dimension</b> of issue ownership can be measured, that it differs from competence issue ownership, and that it is an independent determinant of voting behavior...|$|R

The measures may be confounded with respondents' (dis) agreement with parties' position and general party evaluations. Through a question wording experiment we compare measures of both issue ownership types and test which are most affected by the two confounding factors. We find that competence issue ownership measures are heavily affected by confounding factors while associative issue ownership wordings are less. Challenging existing research, we find that especially the classic 'best at handling'-wording tapping competence issue ownership is most conflated with positions and party preference...|$|R
40|$|The role of phonological {{information}} in English word identification and the activation pattern of phonological and <b>associative</b> <b>dimensions</b> were investigated with a backward-masking paradigm. Mask type (graphemic, homophonic, associative, unrelated word control, and nonletter #-baseline) and target exposure duration were manipulated. Graphemic and homophonic but not associative masks influenced target recognition at 28 ms, and homophonic masks inhibited recognition relative to graphemic masks. At 42 ms, homophonic masks facilitated recognition, and associates inhibited, rather than enhanced, recognition relative to word controls. These {{results suggest that}} phonological computation occurs before associative computation and that phonological inhibition arises from lexical competition. The phonological and associative inhibitory effects are interpreted {{in terms of the}} center-surround perceptual principle. In this interpretation, backward-masking conditions cause observers to seek orthographic rather than phonological codes. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the standard acoustic startle habituation paradigm contains the elements of Pavlovian fear conditioning was tested. In a potentiated startle response paradigm, a startle stimulus and a light conditioned stimulus (CS) were paired. A startle stimulus then was tested alone or following the CS. Freezing behavior was measured toindex conditioned fear. The startle response was potentiated on CS trials, and rats froze more in CS than in non-CS periods. In Experiment I, response to a previously habituated, weak startle stimulus was potentiated. In Experiment 2,response to the same stimulus used as the unconditioned stimulus (US) in training was potentiated. This CS-potentiated response retarded the course of response decrements over training sessions as compared with an explictly unpaired control group. Conditioned fear is a standard feature of this habituation paradigm, serves to potentiate the startle response, and provides an <b>associative</b> <b>dimension</b> lacking in the habituation process per se.

The present theory-driven study applied {{the method of}} a free association task to explore how people express the concepts {{of the world and}} the self in words. The respondents were asked to recall any five words relating with the word world. Afterwards they were asked to recall any five words relating with the word self. The method of free association provided the respondents with absolute freedom to choose any words they wanted. Such free recall task is suggested as being a relatively direct approach to the respondents’ self- and world-related conceptual categories, without enormous rational processing. The results provide us, first, with associative ranges for constructs {{of the world and the}} self, where some <b>associative</b> <b>dimensions</b> are defined by semantic polarities in the meanings of peripheral categories (e. g., Nature vs. Culture). Second, our analysis showed that some groups of verbal categories that were associated with the words world and self are central, while others are peripheral with respect to the central position.

40|$|The central {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to study the role and relevance of {{the balance of power}} factor within regimes for cooperative security with special reference to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF). The balance of power concept is systematically applied to an examination of their history and modalities. This thesis addresses one core question: to what extent may the balance of power, defined in political terms, play a part in such associative security arrangements and in the calculations of the participants? Attention is therefore given to the balance of power factor and its co-existence with an <b>associative</b> <b>dimension</b> part of cooperative security regimes. The dissertation assesses the role of the balance of power as a disposition to promote countervailing arrangements to deny hegemony within and beyond cooperative security even if devoid of direct military content. The establishment of ASEAN and the ARF are analysed within a balance of power perspective. Both institutions were formed with the denial of hegemony in mind but not in a conventional sense. In addition, the balance of power remained a factor in their later developments. Its ongoing relevance is examined by discussing Brunei's motives to join the Association, ASEAN's response to the Third Indochina Conflict, the workings of the Forum, and the Association's involvement in the South China Sea dispute...|$|R

40|$|As incubadoras universitárias têm se constituído nas principais universidades brasileiras desde o fim da década de 1990. Elas trabalham dentro da linha de economia solidária, no desenvolvimento de cooperativas populares ou empreendimentos econômicos solidários e, durante esse trabalho, enfrentam diversos desafios. Um deles é conseguir contribuir com tais empreendimentos em suas dimensões empresa - uma gestão atenta à qualidade do produto ou serviço, aos processos e operações para sua maior eficiência, à sua inserção no mercado e à melhor organização dos seus recursos financeiros e não-financeiros; e associativa - uma gestão atenta à importância de sua missão social, à manutenção de sua vitalidade associativa, aos processos para que a democracia prevaleça e ao seu enraizamento na comunidade e no seu setor de atuação de forma cooperativa. Este trabalho avaliou o desenvolvimento de uma incubadora recém-formada, nos seus dois anos iniciais, na USP campus Ribeirão Preto, com a análise voltada para sua estrutura, equipe, metodologia e atuação junto aos empreendimentos incubados, percebendo as condições favorecedoras e desafiadoras de uma incubação que de fato contribua com ambas as dimensões. O método utilizado foi o de sistematização de experiências, considerado apropriado para construir a linha do tempo da incubadora, constituir os principais marcos e eixos do trabalho realizado e promover a reflexão crítica dos fatos e experiências levantados. Os resultados indicam que houve dificuldade na integração entre as dimensões empresa e associativa na atuação junto aos grupos incubados, com destaque ou maior ênfase para uma dimensão ou outra ao longo do tempo, devido principalmente aos acúmulos da equipe com maior participação naquele momento. Além disso, a percepção dos membros da incubadora foi avaliada por meio de entrevistas estruturadas, e indicou que alguns creditam tal enfoque em uma dimensão ou na outra por conta das demandas do grupo naquele momento, outros para qual fosse a constituição e formação da equipe mais próxima do trabalho e ainda porque indivíduos específicos de cada grupo pudessem demandar abordagens distintas. Por fim, concluiu-se que a incubadora produziu efeitos positivos e negativos devido a essa dificuldade no equilíbrio entre ambas as dimensões nos trabalhos realizados e que, com essa informação, as incubadoras universitárias pelo país podem buscar maior integração entre elas e, assim, atingir através de seus trabalhos com os empreendimentos solidários maior eficiência econômica e felicidade humana. The {{university}} incubators {{have been}} constituted {{in the main}} Brazilian universities {{since the end of}} the 1990 s. They work within the solidarity economy line, in the development of popular cooperatives and solidarity economy enterprises, and during this work, face several challenges. One of them is their capability to achieve contributions to the solidarity enteprises in their company dimension - a careful management to product quality or service, processes and operations to their greater efficiency, its insertion in the market and the best organization of its financial and non-financial resources; and their <b>associative</b> <b>dimension</b> - a management attentive to the importance of its social mission, the maintenance of its associative vitality, processes that makes democracy prevails and its rootedness in the community and its industry, in a cooperative manner. This study evaluated the development of a newly formed incubator in its first two years, at USP campus Ribeirao Preto, with focused analysis of its structure, staff, methodology and performance with the incubated enterprises, realizing that favor and challenging conditions of an incubation that actually contribute to both dimensions. The method used was the systematization of experiences, considered appropriate to construct the time line of the incubator, constitute major milestones and axes of the work and promote critical reflection of the facts and experiences raised. The results indicate that there were difficulties in integration between the company and <b>associative</b> <b>dimensions</b> in performance with the incubated groups, highlighting or with greater emphasis on one dimension or another over time, mainly due to the accumulations of the team with greater participation at that time. Moreover, the perception of the members of the incubator was evaluated through structured interviews, and indicated that some credited an approach focused in one dimension or the other because of the demands of the group at that time, others for which was the establishment and training of staff nearest to the work and because specific individuals of each group might require different approaches. Finally, it was concluded that the incubator has had positive and negative effects due to the difficulty in balancing both dimensions in the performed work, and with this information, the university incubators around the country may seek greater integration between them and thus achieve, through their work with solidarity enterprises, greater economic efficiency and human happiness...|$|R

Several years later Mazzola continued in this direction with his paper “The algebraic and geometric classification of <b>associative</b> algebras of <b>dimension</b> five” [21]. The problem we attempt in this thesis, is to extend the results of Gabriel to the setting of super (or Z 2 -graded) algebras — our main efforts being devoted {{to the case of}} superalgebras of dimension four. We give an algebraic classification for superalgebras of dimension four with non-trivial Z 2 -grading. By combining these results with Gabriel’s we obtain a complete algebraic classification of four dimensional superalgebras. This completes the classification of four dimensional Yetter-Drinfeld module algebras over Sweedler’s Hopf algebra H 4 given by Chen and Zhang in “Four dimensional Yetter-Drinfeld module algebras over H 4 ” [9]. The geometric classification problem leads us to define a new variety, Salgn — the variety of n-dimensional superalgebras—and study some of its properties. The geometry of Salgn is influenced by the geometry of the variety Algn yet it is also more complicated, an important difference being that Salgn is disconnected. While we make significant progress on the geometric classification of four dimensional superalgebras, it is not complete. We discover twenty irreducible components of Salg 4 — however there could be up to two further irreducible components...|$|R
40|$|City grid {{organizations}} are a contextual reality. Given a dominant, all encompassing urban grid context, {{such as the}} South End area of Boston, Massachusetts and {{the opportunity for a}} small single-block sized intervention within, how does one deal with it? To what extent can the built environment, while ordering our existence, also allow association with the diversity of forms, uses, and activities around it? Furthermore, can understanding and transferring some of the underlying principles which govern the additive development of small, older, more associative urban centers, begin to provide clues which can aid us in creating richer and more associative urban environments? An alternative to methods of uniform alignment of building elements is sought. Greater multiplicity within the urban framework is desired though there are few natural landscape elements to guide the process. This thesis explores building more associatively relative to an urban grid. It attempts first to begin to understand the given site using five attributes of <b>associative</b> behavior: <b>dimension,</b> direction, registration, reciprocity and exchange. It then proposes an architectural solution which is a dynamic transformation of surrounding spatial, structural, formal, and use organizations into an organization of greater flexibility and association. The site concentrated upon in this work includes a 200 foot long vacant block area along Washington Street southeast of the comer of Massachusetts A venue, and portions of Washington Street and other streets adjacent to this vacant area. The area was initially built up around 1850. Surviving buildings are composed primarily of masonry partywall buildings. The site is a unique one, however, because of the existence of the Orange Line, a soon to be dismantled elevated rail system. Because of its mass, continuity, and noise, the Orange Line has been a barrier to the development of Washington Street and a major contributor to the decay of the area. Dismantled and introduced as an additional constituent system in a transformation process however, it now has an opportunity to contribute positively {{to the life of the}} area. Simultaneously, the Orange Line's relationship to Washington Street provides precedent for building associatively above the street zone, beyond the political limits of lotlines and city blocks.

40|$|Thesis (DTh) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2002 ENGLISH ABSTRACT: How can believers live {{meaningful}} in our postmodern, disordered world? The {{thesis of}} this study is that the German theologian, Michael Weiker's exciting understanding of pluralism can assist people to get along in a new way in our complex world. This study is in essence a project that aims to assist people to orientate themselves within a world in which they are confronted on a daily basis with a variety of ethical choices, a plurality of lifestyles and values, as well as conflicting claims of the truth in a variety of cultures and religions. This study's point of departure is that Welker's understanding of pluralism can be expressed comprehensively by means of the law-gospel relationship in his work. Welker's understanding of law and gospel is presented as a midway between the clashing mono-hierarchical, dualistic and relativistic views of how theology, the church, believers as well as people outside the church, should orientate themselves within our pluralistic world. For Welker, pluralism is not something that should threaten people, but rather a fragile social phenomenon that should be loved and cherished by humankind. According to Welker, Christianity can contribute to this because the Christian canon, dogmas and church carry a pluralistic form as such. Chapter 1 demonstrates Weiker's definition of, as well as his positive attitude towards pluralism. According to Welker, pluralism must be structured. It signifies a fine balance between the <b>associative</b> and systemic <b>dimensions</b> of experience. The relationship between law and gospel in both the Biblical traditions and post modern cultures holds the key for him to the correct structuring of pluralism in the academic world, in modern societies as well as between cultures which are always threatened by either the mono-hierarchical or relativistic forms of pluralism. Chapter 2 indicates that according to Welker the law means that creation is constituted by associative, interdependent structural patterns, which promote and maintain life as such. Welker's understanding of the law means that, together with other postmodern theories, theology confirms the pluralistic nature of the world. The law balances the <b>associative</b> and systemic <b>dimensions</b> of pluralism by pluralising in judicial -, mercy - and cultural laws. The pluralism of the law in the Old Testament can help our modern world to structure the public sphere of society in such a way that justice and truth can be achieved in order to establish a collective future for all mankind. In Chapter 3 it becomes clear that sin can render the good law of God powerless and that all forms of pluralism are not necessarily good. For Welker, knowledge of creation (the law) means finite knowledge. Sin means for Welker the abolition and isolation of the associative character and interdependency of the differential spheres of creation. According to Welker, the absolutising of either the associative or the systemic dimensions of pluralism renders the law of God, as in Biblical traditions, powerless in modern societies. This in turn leads to chaotic relativism or to oppressing, totalitarian systemic forms of pluralism. The reality of sin means that it becomes impossible for theology to legitimise all postmodern theories, uncritically. The question remains, how is it possible to distinguish between good and bad forms of pluralism? Chapter 4 argues that Welker's understanding of the gospel can assist us with this problematic issue. The gospel, with the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ at its centre, signifies for Welker the revelation of the power of sin on the one hand, whilst on the other hand it reveals the freedom of the gospel. The cross of Christ exposes for Welker how the differential structural patterns of creation can degenerate in societies, whilst faith in the risen One signifies the revelation of the structural relations which is given in Christ. Christ's resurrection therefore means hope for creation. Welker argues that the Spirit maintains the <b>associative</b> and systemic <b>dimensions</b> of pluralism in creation. This is done by realising the intentions of the law, namely justice, mercy and complete knowledge of God in the public sphere of societies without uplifting the natural, social and cultural differentiation that exists between people and groups of people. The chaotic individualism and the mono-hierarchical degeneration of functional systems in our society lead to a feeling of powerlessness in modern societies. Opposed to this, the Spirit creates an alternative public community of holy ones that has not grown out of traditional, moral or political consensus. This community, associative and systemic, congregational and ecumenical, as body of the crucified and risen One, realises the kingdom of God universally under a variety of finite, particular circumstances in creation. Chapter 5 evaluates the practical results of Welker's law-gospel distinction. Pluralism can, according to Welker, easily be damaged within our mass- and functional societies. As alternative, people should learn to cherish and love pluralism. The benefit of Welker's law-gospel distinction is that it generates criteria, which can assist to distinguish between good and bad forms of pluralism. His drawing together of the <b>associative</b> and systemic <b>dimensions</b> of pluralism helps us to see that modern societies will gain nothing in falling back on personal and interpersonal experiences and reality constructions. People must rather accept the challenge to live complex, creative and interdisciplinary lives. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Hoe kan gelowiges betekenisvol in ons komplekse, postmoderne, deurmekaar wereld leef? Die tese van die studie is dat die Duitse teoloog, Michael Welker, se opwindende verstaan van pluralisme, mense kan help om op In nuwe wyse in ons komplekse wereld oor die weg te kom. Die studie is ten diepste dus In lewensorienterende projek wat mense wil help om hulself te orienteer binne In wereld waar hul daagliks gekonfronteer word met In verskeidenheid van etiese keuses, In pluraliteit van lewensstyle en lewenswaardes en botsende waarheidsaansprake van verskillende kulture en godsdienste. Die studie werk met die vertrekpunt dat Welker se verstaan van pluralisme omvattend uitgedruk word deur die wet-evangelie verhouding in sy denke. Welker se verstaan van wet en evangelie word in die studie aangebied as middeweg tussen die botsende rnonohierarqiese, dualistiese en relatiwistiese standpunte van hoe die teologie, kerk, gelowiges, maar ook mense buite die kerk, hulself binne ons pluralistiese ieefwereld moet orienteer. Pluralisme is vir Welker nie iets wat mense bedreig nie, maar In brose samelewingsverskynsel wat mense moet liefhe en koester. Die Christendom kan volgens hom hiertoe In bydrae maak omdat die christelike kanon, leerstukke, en kerk as sodanig In pluralistiese gestalte dra. In hoofstuk 1 word aangetoon hoekom Welker so positief is oor pluralisme en hoe hy dit definieer. Pluralisme moet volgens Welker gestruktureer word en beteken vir hom In fyn balans tussen die assosiatiewe en sistemiese dimensies van ervaring. Die verhouding tussen wet en evangelie in die Bybelse tradisies en postmoderne kulture hou vir hom die sleutel tot die regte strukturering van pluralisme in die akademie, in moderne samelewings en tussen verskillende kulture wat altyd deur monohierarpiese 6 f relatiwistiese vorme van pluralisme bedreig word. In hoofstuk 2 word aangetoon dat die wet vir Welker beteken dat die skepping uit assosiatiewe, interafhanklike strukturele patrone opgebou is wat lewe as sodanig bevorder en in stand hou. Welker se verstaan van die wet beteken dat die teologie saam met ander postmoderne teoriee die pluralistiese aard van die wereld bevestig. Die wet in die Ou- Testament balanseer vir Welker die assosiatiewe en sistemiese dimensies van pluralisme deur in geregtigheids-, barmhartigheids- en kultiese kodes te pluraliseer. Die pluralistiese struktuur van die wet kan moderne samelewings begelei om pluralisme so te struktureer dat die soeke na geregtigheid en waarheid realiseer word. In hoofstuk 3 word dit duidelik dat die sonde die goeie wet van God magteloos kan maak en dat aile vorme van pluralisme nie noodwendig goed is nie. Kennis van die wet of skeppingskennis beteken vir Welker eindigheidskennis. Sonde beteken vir hom die opheffing en isolering van die assosiatiewe, interafhanklikheid van die differensiele sfere van die skepping. Volgens Welker word die wet van God, net soos in die Bybelse tradisies, ook in moderne samelewings magteloos gemaak deur die verabsolutering van 6 f die assosiatiewe of sistemiese dimensies van pluralisme wat aanleiding gee tot chaotiese relatiwisme of onderdrukkende, totalitere sistemiese vorme van pluralisme. Die sonde beteken dat dit vir die teologie onmoontlik is om postmoderne teoriee, wat onkrities is teenoor die pluralismes van ons samelewings, sondermeer te legitimeer. Die vraag is hoe dit moontlik is om in die strukturering van ons pluralistiese wereld tussen goeie en slegte vorms van pluralisme te onderskei? In hoofstuk 4 word aangevoer dat Welker se verstaan van die evangelie ons hiermee kan help. Die evangelie, met die kruisiging en opstanding van Jesus Christus as middelpunt, beteken vir Welker enersyds die openbaring van die mag van die sonde, en andersyds die onthulling van die vryheid van die evangelie. Die kruis van Christus is vir Welker die openbaring van hoe die differensiele strukturele patrone van die skepping in samelewings kan verword, terwyl geloof in die Opgestane Een die onthulling van die strukturele relasies wat in Christus gegee is, beteken. Christus se opstanding beteken dus hoop vir die skepping. Die Gees hou volgens Welker die assosiatiewe en sistemiese dimensies van pluralisme in die skepping in stand deur op In pluralistiese wyse die intensies van die wet, naamlik geregtigheid, barmhartigheid en volkome Godskennis in die publieke sfeer van samelewings, te realiseer sonder om die natuurlike, sosiale en kulturele differensiasie tussen mense, groepe en groepe mense op te hef. Teenoor chaotiese individualisme en die rnonohierarqiese verwording van funksionele sisteme wat aanleiding gee tot die ervaring van magteloosheid in moderne samelewings, skep die Gees volgens Welker, In alternatiewe publieke sfeer wat nie uit tradisionele morele of politieke konsensus groei nie. 'n Gemeenskap van heiliges, wat as liggaam van die gekruisigde en opgestane Een, assosiatief en sistemies, gemeentelik en ekumenies, die koninkryk van God, universeel onder In veelheid van eindige, partikuliere omstandighede in die skepping, realiseer. In hoofstuk 5 word die resultate van Welker se wet-evangelie onderskeid geevalueer. Volgens Welker kan pluralisme maklik skade Iy binne ons rnassa- en funksionele samelewings en daarom het mense die opdrag om pluralisme lief te he en te koester. Die winspunte van Welker se wet-evangelie onderskeid is dat dit kriteria genereer wat help om tussen goeie en slegte vorme van pluralisme te onderskei. Welker se byeenhou van die assosiatiewe en sistemiese dimensies van pluralisme help ons om veral in te sien dat dit moderne mense nie veel gaan baat om terug te val op persoonlike en interpersoonlike ervarings en werklikheidskonstruksies nie, maar dat mense die uitdaging moet aanvaar om kompleks, kreatief en interdissipliner te leer leef...|$|R
