5|$|During a sandstorm, the {{wind-blown sand}} {{particles}} become electrically charged. Such electric fields, which {{range in size}} up to 80 kV/m, can produce sparks and cause interference with telecommunications equipment. They are also unpleasant for humans and can cause headaches and nausea. The electric fields are caused by collision between <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> and by the impacts of saltating sand grains landing on the ground. The mechanism is little understood but the particles usually have a negative charge when their diameter is under 250 μm and a positive one when they are over 500 μm.|$|E
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by the bright red pigment in the thallus. The pigment, first isolated from the species by Hesse in 1904, is called chiodectonic acid. The lichen also contains the colorless depside compound confluentinic acid. A 2005 study employed the technique Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical composition of the differently colored zones. The white crystalline zone contains calcium oxalate dihydrate, or weddellite, a chemical substance found in other lichens and extremophiles growing on calcium-rich surfaces. Some {{have suggested that the}} calcium oxalate serves in the organism's survival strategy: the storage of water as a crystalline hydrate is essential for periods of drought in desiccated environments, and calcium oxalate has been identified as dissuading herbivores. Because the lichen grows on calcium-poor surfaces, calcium ions are thought to be acquired from rain, bird droppings, and <b>airborne</b> <b>particles.</b>|$|E

While observations on the night of December 29, 1992, were normal, unusually high albedo and polarization features were recorded the following night that did not change in appearance over the six minutes of data collection. Observations three days later showed a similar, but smaller, anomaly in the same vicinity. While the viewing conditions for this region were close to specular, it was argued that the amplitude of the observations were not consistent with a specular reflection of sunlight. The favored hypothesis was that this was the consequence of light scattering from clouds of <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> resulting from a release of gas. The fractured floor of this crater was cited as a possible source of the gas.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of surface treatment and adhesive agent on the shear bond strength between a resin composite and an aged dental amalgam (356 -days). Materials and MethodsSixty amalgam (Tytin) disks were stored in water at 37 °C for 365 days. Half of the specimens were <b>airborne</b> <b>particle</b> abraded and the remaining half was roughened with a greenstone. Resin composite cylinders (Tetric) were bonded onto the amalgam surfaces using Amalgambond, All-Bond 2 or Scotchbond 1 (n= 10). Specimens were stored in water at 37 °C for 7 days and thermocycled. Shear bond strength testing was carried on an Instron Universal Testing Machine. Stereomicroscope examination was carried out to determine the bond failure sites. Results were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls’ post-hoc tests and the level of statistical significance was set at 5 %. ResultsSurface treatment significantly affected the shear bond strengths (p< 0. 001) with <b>airborne</b> <b>particle</b> abrasion producing the highest bond strengths. Significantly higher shear bond strengths (p= 0. 047) were found with Scotchbond 1 in comparison with All-Bond 2, in the <b>airborne</b> <b>particle</b> abraded specimens.

5|$|Sand dunes are accumulations of {{windblown sand}} {{piled up in}} mounds or ridges. They form {{downwind}} of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> to settle. As the wind blows, saltation and creep {{take place on the}} windward side of the dune and individual grains of sand move uphill. When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side. The upwind slope typically has a gradient of 10° to 20° while the lee slope is around 32°, the angle at which loose dry sand will slip. As this wind-induced movement of sand grains takes place, the dune moves slowly {{across the surface of the}} ground. Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields. When these are extensive, they are known as sand seas or ergs.|$|E
5|$|London's dead had {{traditionally}} been buried {{in and around}} local churches, and with {{a limited amount of}} space for burials, the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials. In {{the first half of the}} 19thcentury the population of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. Despite this rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately 300acres (0.5sqmi; 1.2km2), spread across around 200 small sites. Graveyards became very congested. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid. Public health policy at this time was generally shaped by the miasma theory (the belief that <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> were the primary factor in the spread of contagious disease), and the bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern. A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London's burial grounds had become so overcrowded that it was impossible to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of our research}} was to compare the <b>airborne</b> <b>particle</b> micromorphology and chemistry in the Brussels environment during agriculture working periods in the surrounding farming region. We used specific methods and instrumentation that are adapted to the climate peculiarities of the Brussels region, the period of investigations (12 months) and the proposed objectives. For the agricultural works we defined the following six periods: before sowing, sowing, after sowing, before harvest, harvest and after harvest. The results indicate a possible temporal correlation between agricultural work periods and <b>airborne</b> <b>particle</b> concentration, micromorphology and chemistry in the Brabant-Brussels region. For wheat and corn plant-growth periods, the average particle size, defined as the area obtained by a planar projection of the particulate, showed important variations in time. For sugar beet and endive, the average area size variations are less important. The roughness and sphericity parameters for the growth periods of the four different plants also showed significant differences. Many of the larger particulates (> 10 microm) are aggregates of even finer particles coated with many still finer ones. The <b>airborne</b> <b>particle</b> chemistry averages (atomic percentage At%), showed that three constituents (Si, S and Fe) dominate all the samples (except for particles 3 - 10 microm in size, which contain a relatively large percentage of Al). Applying similar investigation methods to study the correlations between <b>airborne</b> <b>particle</b> dynamics in urban zones and the agriculture working periods in their surrounding regions could {{be of interest to}} better understand the complexity of the PM problematic.

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} a specific <b>airborne</b> <b>particle</b> abrasion pretreatment on dentin and its effects on microtensile bond strengths of four commercial total-etch adhesives. Midcoronal occlusal dentin of extracted human molars was used. Teeth were randomly assigned to 4 groups according to the adhesive system used: OptiBond FL (FL), OptiBond Solo Plus (SO), Prime & Bond (PB), and Riva Bond LC (RB). Specimens from each group were further divided into two subgroups: control specimens were treated with adhesive procedures; abraded specimens were pretreated with <b>airborne</b> <b>particle</b> abrasion using 50 [*]μm Al 2 O 3 before adhesion. After bonding procedures, composite crowns were incrementally built up. Specimens were sectioned perpendicular to adhesive interface to produce multiple beams, which were tested under tension until failure. Data were statistically analysed. Failure mode analysis was performed. Overall comparison showed significant increase in bond strength (p< 0. 001) between abraded and no-abraded specimens, independently of brand. Intrabrand comparison showed statistical increase when abraded specimens were tested compared to no-abraded ones, with the exception of PB that did not show such difference. Distribution of failure mode was relatively uniform among all subgroups.

Brackets were bonded to the conditioned ceramic specimens with a light-polymerized resin composite. All specimens were stored in water for 1 week at 37 °C and then thermocycled (1000 cycles, 5 °C to 55 °C, 30 seconds). The shear bond strength values were measured on a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. Brackets treated with silica coating with silanization had significantly greater bond strength values (13. 6 MPa, P _. 01) than brackets treated with orthophosphoric acid (8. 5 MPa).
