For example, if the <b>ACTUATOR</b> <b>type</b> specifies that its messages contain a boolean representing their activation state and the COLOR_LED type specifies that its messages contain a byte that represents the desired color, the complete message format of the COLOR_LED service is a boolean followed by a byte.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Active {{vibration}} damping {{is a well}} known application to efficiently damp the vibrations of mechanic machines, vehicles and other flexible structures. For the design of an appropriate control system often piezo electric ceramics are used. Actuator patches are commonly used for the active damping of thin structures such as beams and plates. Stack actuators are mostly implemented in truss structures as active members. When the structure to be controlled has considerable stiffness or the actuator cannot be integrated in the structure itself {{a different kind of}} <b>actuator</b> <b>type</b> becomes necessary. In this paper an actuator/console concept is presented that combines the advantages of patch and stack actuators, thus leading to a concept that generates a pair of bending moments with considerable amplitudes. Finally, the proposed concept is shown to be capable of effectively reducing flexible vibrations of a simple laboratory beam experiment...|$|E

It provides a flat surface when it is not activated while it provides a partial-spherical shape when pressure is applied. When 2 adjacent actuators exhibit a large deformation, a surface contact between them is observed.
