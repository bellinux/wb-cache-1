5|$|By 1916, the Great War {{had been}} ongoing {{for almost two}} years, during which anarchists had taken part in anti-war {{movements}} across Europe, issuing numerous anti-war statements in anarchist and leftist publications. In February 1915, a statement was issued by an assembly of anarchists from various regions, including England, Switzerland, Italy, the United States, Russia, France, and the Netherlands. The document was signed by such figures as Domela Nieuwenhuis, Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Luigi Bertoni, Saul Yanovsky, Harry Kelly, Thomas Keell, Lilian Wolfe, Rudolf Rocker, and George Barrett. It was also endorsed by Errico Malatesta and Alexander Schapiro, two of three secretaries elected to their position at the Anarchist International of 1907. It set out several viewpoints, including that all wars {{were the result of}} the current system of society, and therefore not the blame of any particular government; did not regard a defensive and offensive war as being fundamentally distinctly different; and encouraged all anarchists to support only class conflict and the liberation of oppressed populaces as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>by</b> which to resolve wars between nation-states.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids, as well {{as having}} strong natal philopatry, exhibit strong site fidelity, {{returning}} to the same nesting site, burrow or territory in sequential years. The figure varies for different species but is high for most species, an estimated 91% for Bulwer's petrels. The strength of this fidelity can also vary with sex; almost 85% of male Cory's shearwaters return to the same burrow to breed the year after a successful breeding attempt, while the figure for females is around 76%. This tendency towards using the same site {{from year to year}} is matched by strong mate fidelity, with birds breeding with the same partner for many years; in fact it is suggested that the two are linked, site fidelity being <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>by</b> which partnered birds could meet {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season. One pair of northern fulmars bred as a pair in the same site for 25 years. Like the albatrosses the procellariids take several years to reach sexual maturity, though due to the greater variety of sizes and lifestyles, the age of first breeding stretches from just three years in the smaller species to 12 years in the larger ones.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes {{was created}} with {{the merger of}} Serbia, Montenegro and the South Slav-inhabited areas of Austria-Hungary on 1 December 1918, in the {{immediate}} aftermath of World War I. The Army of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was established at war's end to defend the new state. It was formed around the nucleus of the victorious Royal Serbian Army, as well as armed formations raised in regions formerly controlled by Austria-Hungary. Many former Austro-Hungarian officers and soldiers became members of the new army. From the beginning, much like other aspects of public life in the new kingdom, the army was dominated by ethnic Serbs, who saw it as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>by</b> which to secure Serb political hegemony.|$|E

The construction of ecclesiastical buildings, much like castles, was often <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>by</b> which mediaeval rulers displayed their pre-eminent status, which in turn could explain Fergus' ecclesiastical activities.

25|$|By 1907 {{a select}} group of avant-garde artists in Paris were reevaluating their own work in {{relation}} to that of Paul Cézanne. A retrospective of Cézanne's paintings had been held at the Salon d'Automne of 1904. Current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 Salon d'Automne, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907.

25|$|The {{wood mouse}} Apodemus sylvaticus {{possesses}} spermatozoa with falciform morphology. Another characteristic which makes these gametocytes unique {{is the presence}} of an apical hook on the sperm head. This hook is used to attach to the hooks or to the flagella of other spermatozoa. Aggregation is caused by these attachments and mobile trains result. These trains provide improved motility in the female reproductive tract and are <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>by</b> which fertilization is promoted.|$|E
25|$|A major {{function}} of the Commission is to regulate the use of violence. For instance, a mafioso who wants to commit a murder in another clan's territory must ask {{the permission of the}} local boss; the commission enforces this rule. Any murder of a mafioso or prominent individual (police, lawyers, politicians, journalists, etc.) must be approved by the commission. Such acts can potentially upset other clans and spark a war, so the Commission provides <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>by</b> which to obtain their approval.|$|E

25|$|For several decades, {{researchers}} have also pursued various forms of suspended animation as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>by</b> which to indefinitely extend mammalian lifespan. Some scientists have voiced support for the feasibility of the cryopreservation of humans, known as cryonics. Cryonics is predicated on the concept that some people considered clinically dead by today's medicolegal standards are not actually dead according to information-theoretic death and can, in principle, be resuscitated given sufficient technological advances. The goal of current cryonics procedures is tissue vitrification, a technique first used to reversibly cryopreserve a viable whole organ in 2005.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 15th century at the latest, Robin Hood had become {{associated}} with May Day celebrations, with revellers dressing as Robin or {{as members of}} his band for the festivities. This was not common throughout England, but in some regions the custom lasted until Elizabethan times, and {{during the reign of}} Henry VIII, was briefly popular at court. Robin was often allocated the role of a May King, presiding over games and processions, but plays were also performed with the characters in the roles, sometimes performed at church ales, <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>by</b> which churches raised funds.|$|E

This standard allows, for example, several independent standard definition video signals to be multiplexed onto an HD-SDI interface, and transmitted down one wire. This standard doesn't merely adjust EAV and SAV timing {{to meet the requirements}} of the lower-bitrate formats; instead, it provides <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>by</b> which an entire SDI format (including synchronization words, ancillary data, and video payload) can be encapsulated and transmitted as ordinary data payload within a 292M stream.|$|E

Bell's records show that the city made nearly a million dollars just in impound fees in fiscal year 2008-09, which works out to be about $10 per citizen in this small town. Bell was charging $300 for unlicensed motorists to recover their cars, three times what Los Angeles County and neighboring cities charge."All of this was just <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>by</b> Rizzo to nickel and dime the community to death to get more money out of them", Christina Garcia, a community activist, said.|$|E
25|$|Mitteldorf {{proposed}} a group {{benefit of a}} limited lifespan involving regulation of population dynamics. Populations in nature are subject to boom and bust cycles. Often overpopulation can be punished by famine or by epidemic. Either one could wipe out an entire population.
