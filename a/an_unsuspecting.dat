5|$|Hermaphroditism {{appeared}} in medical literature {{enough to be}} considered common knowledge, although cases were rare. Homoerotic elements in literature were pervasive, specifically the masquerade of one gender for another to fool <b>an</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> woman into being seduced. Such plot devices were used in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (1601), The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser in 1590, and James Shirley's The Bird in a Cage (1633). Extraordinary cases during the Renaissance of women taking on male personae and going undetected for years or decades have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of conquest, encomienda rights {{effectively}} meant rights to pillage and round up slaves, usually {{in the form of a}} group of mounted conquistadores launching a lightning slave raid upon <b>an</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> population centre. Prisoners would be branded as slaves, and taken to a port to be sold, in order that the conquistadores could purchase weapons, supplies, and horses. In some cases the conquistadores would round up the elders, chain them up, whip them and set their war dogs upon them, in order to force the natives to hand over tribute such as food and clothing.|$|E
5|$|By 1528, Spanish {{colonial power}} had been {{established}} in the Chiapas Highlands, and encomienda rights were being issued to individual conquistadores. Spanish dominion extended from the upper drainage of the Grijalva, across Comitán and Teopisca to the Ocosingo valley. The north and northwest were incorporated into the Villa de Espíritu Santo district, that included Ch'ol Maya territory around Tila.

5|$|Series 4 {{began on}} 21 September 1996 with the {{introduction}} of new presenters Zoe Ball and Jamie Theakston and with them came an array of new features. One such item was called Cloud 9 which replaced the former Famous For Five Minutes. Sitting in a den surrounded by sparkles, pink feather boas and harps, 'Zoe would ring up <b>an</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> viewer who had been nominated by their friend or family and make their lifelong dream or ambition come true. The following week's Cloud 9 would then show how that person got on as the segment would be filmed in the week. Cloud 9 also used an edited version of Dreams (The Developed Arrested Mix) by Gabrielle as its theme tune.|$|E
5|$|In the 2008–09 season, Brashear's point total {{dropped to}} four, his lowest total since 1995–96 {{while he was}} with the Montreal Canadiens. During the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs, he earned a {{suspension}} for two separate on-ice incidents. On April 26, 2009, the Capitals faced the New York Rangers in Game 6 of their first-round series. In the pre-game warm-ups, Brashear shoved Rangers enforcer Colton Orr, then delivered a blind-side hit to Blair Betts mid-way through the game's first period. As a result of the hit, and a possible elbow, Betts suffered a broken orbital bone and was out indefinitely. Colin Campbell ruled that the hit was late on <b>an</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> player; he also believed it targeted the head, and as a result caused significant injury. For his actions, Brashear was given a six-game suspension by the League — one for the pre-game altercation and five for the hit on Betts.|$|E
5|$|Low's tactics {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} hoisting false colours and approaching <b>an</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> vessel. Off {{the coast of}} St John's, Newfoundland, Low mistook a fully armed man-of-war for a fishing boat, and barely escaped. He moved on to Conception Bay, capturing a number of boats around the Grand Banks southeast of Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic to the Azores. There, he captured a French (or Portuguese—sources differ) pink, a narrow-sterned former man of war, which Low rearmed and refitted as his new flagship, naming it the Rose Pink. He also captured an English vessel with two Portuguese passengers aboard. Low had his crew hoist them up and drop them back down from the yard arm several times, until they died. He {{moved on to the}} Canaries, Cape Verde and then back across to the coast of Brazil, where he was driven back by foul weather.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Unni, Babu, Shaji, Shenoy, and MLA meet atop an {{apartment}} building to discuss {{the circumstances surrounding the}} gold they smuggled into Kozhikode and lost to an ambush while in transit from the airport. They suspect Ramesh is involved since he disappeared right after the incident. They devise a plan to kidnap Jayanthi in order to force Ramesh to return the gold. <b>An</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> Raju and Jayanthi become the targets of their surprise attack in which Jayanthi is rendered unconscious. Raju draws his concealed handgun and foils the kidnapping by shooting at his assailants. He collects the unconscious Jayanthi and transports her to a safe place. When she awakens, she finds herself surrounded by strangers. She also discovers that Raju is not just a taxi driver rather he is part of an investigation to find Ramesh and the missing gold. Raju explains to her that Ramesh was involved in the smuggling, and has since become the target of the criminals. Jayanthi returns to Rekha's home for safety, and Chandrasekharan begins investigating Raju who, in a turn of events, has raised suspicion.|$|E
25|$|<b>An</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> {{turn for}} the history of art {{criticism}} came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo {{as one of the first}} psychology based analyses on a work of art. Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s Lives. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.|$|E
25|$|Partial {{clogging}} {{is particularly}} insidious, {{as it is}} usually not discovered immediately, but only later by <b>an</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> user trying to flush a loaded toilet. Overflowing of the water mixed with excrement may then occur, depending on the bowl volume, tank capacity and severity of clogging. For this reason, rooms with flush toilets may be designed as wet rooms, with a second drain on the floor, and a shower head capable of reaching the whole floor area. Common means to remedy clogging include use of a toilet plunger, drain cleaner or a plumber's snake.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> the <b>unsuspecting</b> Veientines {{rushed to}} defend their walls from the {{suddenly}} frantic Roman army, the Romans entered the tunnel.

50|$|This {{successful}} counteroffensive by the Fengtian clique was, however, short-lived.

25|$|As a flightless {{species in}} the rich biozone of the African savanna, the common ostrich must face a variety of {{formidable}} predators throughout its life cycle. Animals that prey on ostriches of all ages may include cheetahs, lions, leopards, African hunting dogs, and spotted hyenas. Common ostriches can often outrun most of their predators in a pursuit, so most predators will try to ambush <b>an</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> bird using obstructing vegetation or other objects. A notable exception is the cheetah, {{which is the most}} prolific predator of adult common ostriches due to its own great running speeds.|$|E
25|$|The Cutting {{out of the}} Hermione, or Capture of Hermione, was a naval {{action that}} took place at Puerto Cabello, Venezuela on 25 October 1799. The {{formerly}} British frigate HMS Hermione, which had been {{handed over to the}} Spanish by its crew following a vicious mutiny, lay in the heavily guarded sea port of Puerto Cabello now under the command of Don Ramon de Chalas. A British frigate, , was sent under Edward Hamilton to recapture Hermione. In naval terms this was called a cutting out operation—a boarding attack by small boats, preferably at night and against <b>an</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> and anchored target. This had become a popular tactic during the later 18th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of photography {{and more recently}} the video camera has opened the art of capturing images of people and scenes at a relatively low cost to the true amateur. A person can now capture images in {{both public and private}} situations. A feature of most private photographs and videos is that they are not intended for viewing outside of a very limited range of people, and seldom if ever by the general public. Amateur photography, which includes nude photography, which has previously been produced for personal enjoyment, is increasingly being more widely disseminated through the internet, at times without the knowledge and consent of the subject of the photograph, and to their subsequent embarrassment. Also, the use of secret photography to capture images of <b>an</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> person (undressed or not, and whether for personal use, or intended for posting on the Internet) creates additional personal privacy issues.|$|E

25|$|The Italian stiletto, {{originally}} a purely offensive weapon {{used to kill}} <b>an</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> or wounded adversary, was later embraced throughout Italy as a fighting knife for close combat confrontations. The popularity of the stiletto in the Kingdom of Sicily resulted {{in the development of}} the scherma di stiletto siciliano (Sicilian school of stiletto fighting). The stiletto was purely a thrusting or stabbing weapon, and the scherma di stiletto siciliano accordingly taught fighting movements designed to avoid the tip of the opponent's blade (scanso). Techniques characteristic of the scherma di stiletto siciliano include sbasso (bending to ground), in quarto tagliata (tacking to left or right), and the balzo (leap to evade the enemy’s blade). A person skilled in the use of a stiletto would thrust the knife deep into the victim, then twist the blade sharply in various directions before retracting it, causing the sharp point to inflict severe internal damage not readily apparent when examining the entrance wound.|$|E

25|$|Uncharted 2 is an action-adventure {{platform}} {{video game}} played from a third-person view, with the player {{in control of}} Nathan Drake. Drake is physically adept {{and is able to}} jump, climb, and scale narrow ledges and wall-faces to get between points. Drake can be equipped with up to two firearms – one single-handed and one two-handed – and a limited supply of grenades. Drake can pick up weapons, automatically replacing the existing weapon he was using, and additional ammunition from slain enemies. The player can direct Drake to take cover behind corners or low walls using either aimed or blind-fire to kill his enemies. The player can also have Drake fire while moving. If Drake is undetected by his enemies, the player can attempt to use stealth to take them out, such as by sneaking up behind them to knock them out with one hit, or by pulling <b>an</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> foe over a ledge from which Drake is hanging. In most areas, if all of the foes patrolling are killed stealthily then other waves that would normally appear do not. Some areas of the game require the player to solve puzzles with the use of Drake's journal, which provides clues towards the puzzles' solutions. When enabled, a hint system provides gameplay clues, such as the direction of the next objective.|$|E
