60|$|The {{next moment}} his arm was again round me. I clung {{to him as}} to a rock, for of a truth I had never felt a grasp so steady and withal so gentle and kindly, as was his <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders.</b> I tried to murmur words of thanks, but again that wretched feeling of {{sickness}} and faintness overcame me, {{and for a second}} or two it seemed to me as if I were slipping into another world. The stranger's voice came to my ear, as it were through cotton-wool.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{set out on}} my Raleigh Sports... I arrived elated {{and full}} of {{anticipation}} but my joy was short-lived, all the doors were locked and barred {{and there was no}} sign of life. Without warning a side door flew open and a small powerfully built man came hurtling out of the gloom into the sunlight. A flapping empty sleeve hung where his right arm should have been. He poured a tirade of French at me before stepping back inside and slamming the door. I gave the door another swift kick and shouted in English that all I wanted was to see the famous track. The door slowly opened and the one-armed man stepped outside, but this time a broad smile covered his previously angry face."Anglais?" [...] he said, as if uttering some special password. He spoke in halting English. Did I know Wembley? He had ridden the London six-day there? He put his one good arm <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> and escorted me and my Raleigh into the stadium.|$|R
40|$|I {{have one}} sister, Jenny, {{and most of}} our {{childhood}} was spent living in the country. With few other peers nearby to play with, we were best friends. Over time, we grew {{to be a very}} imaginative duo. I have many memories of playing pretend. It started early on. My earliest recollection of this activity is a happy one that is most likely triggered by a photograph of Jenny and myself. We are {{standing in front of the}} fireplace. Jennyʼs arm is <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> and mine is around her back. We are both smiling. The photograph provides a three quarter view. We are each wearing a ruffled bonnet. Under Jennyʼs is a red yarn wig. The bonnets are tightly tied around our chins. Our faces are decorated with exaggerated freckles in a classic three points in a triangle fashion. We are wearing red, long sleeved frocks overlaid with white jumpers that have green diamond appliqués around the waist. Underneath these rompers we are sporting white knickers. Some may think that we are supposed to be Raggedy Ann, but those in the know (people, especially women, born in the mid 70 s to early 80 s) would recognize the garb as belonging to Strawberry Shortcake. Our mom fashioned these costumes for us on her sewing machine. She always nurtured and fostered our desire to pretend to be other characters or people and the creativity that came out of it...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{would have}} guessed that the dead Japanese was only about {{fourteen}} years old and there he lay dead. My thoughts turned to some mother back in Japan who would receive word that her son {{had been killed in}} battle. Then one of the Marines, who I found out later had been through other campaigns, reached over and roughly grabbed the Japanese soldier by the belt and ripped his shirt off. Somebody said, 'What are you looking for?' And he said, 'I'm looking for a money belt. Japs always carry money belts.' Well, this Jap didn't. Another Marine veteran of combat saw that the dead soldier had some gold teeth, so he took the butt of his rifle and banged him on the jaw, hoping to extract the gold teeth. Whether he did or not I don't know, because at that point I turned around and walked away. I went over to where I thought no one would see me and sat down. Although my eyes were dry, inside my heart was wrenching, not at seeing the dead soldier, but at seeing the way some of my comrades had treated that dead body. That bothered me a great deal. Pretty soon Al came over and sat down beside me and put his arm <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b> He knew what I was feeling. When I turned to look at Al he had tears running down his face." ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{connection}} with the chimps is evident when he teaches 11-year-old Cozi to climb a tree for the first time. [...] "Cozi never had been up a tree before, and I could feel he was nervous of falling but also elated by the new experience," [...] said Cussons. [...] "As {{he put his arm}} <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> for security, I felt then that, although we belonged to different species, Cozi saw me not just as a friend but a brother he trusted with his life." ...|$|E
5000|$|Conservative Central Office {{were not}} so sure. They were {{concerned}} that a local businessman with little fame or track record would struggle to beat the former MP and author and the World War II hero. Odds were given of 6:1 against the Conservatives winning. Harris was summoned to see Party leader Winston Churchill, which Harris realised was to dissuade him from standing. He later said, [...] "when he discovered how determined I was to win the seat, {{he put his arm}} <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> and said he would help me all he could." [...] Churchill toured the constituency, making speeches from the top of his car. Helpfully, his daughter Mary Soames was then in a Croydon maternity hospital giving birth to her son, Nicholas, bringing the campaign positive publicity. In the end, Harris triumphed with an 11,664 majority. A national newspaper the next morning ran the headline [...] "Oh what a beautiful morning". The song (from Oklahoma!) became his theme tune when touring Croydon.|$|E
5000|$|... "Convinced that I had no {{intention}} of pulling out a gun or whatever other hidden weapon, they rushed up towards me, faking - for the few people passing by, intrigued at this curious crowding from the square - the joy of a friendly rendezvous. Each one could not contain from friendly remarks: 'How are you, comrade? How long since we saw each other last?' The height of enthusiasm was shown by the first to arrive at my side. He jumped, embraced me, held my head in his hands, kissed me on both cheeks, saying: 'If you only know how long I have been waiting for you!' ...The following events happened with a sleight and speed worthy of some experts. In this simulated stampede, one got my suitcase, two put their arms <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> while the others, in an instant, searched me thoroughly. Everything happened while walking, since almost the same time I got to see myself reaching the green car; and not even to this day I can't remember how many of us fit inside, on top of each other."

500|$|Mrs. Davis {{recounted the}} {{circumstances}} of her husband's capture as described below: [...] "Just before day the enemy charged our camp yelling like demons... I pleaded with him to let me throw over him a large waterproof wrap which had often served him in sickness during the summer season for a dressing gown and which I hoped might so cover his person that in the grey of the morning {{he would not be}} recognized. As he strode off I threw over his head a little black shawl which was <b>around</b> <b>my</b> own <b>shoulders,</b> saying that he could not find his hat and after he started sent my colored woman after him with a bucket for water hoping that he would pass unobserved." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, in {{that case}} we would all fall together," [...] {{returned}} the Ork. [...] "Get aboard, little girl; sit across <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> and put both your arms <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{advance of}} the Second Vatican Council, Frings gave a speech in Genoa with the title: [...] "Das Konzil auf dem Hintergrund der Zeitlage im Unterschied zum ersten vatikanischen Konzil" [...] ("The council on the {{background}} of the present time in contrast to the First Vatican Council"). When Pope John XXIII later got hold of the text of the speech, he summoned Frings for an audience at the Vatican. Cardinal Frings, who was doubtful as to whether the pope liked his speech, said to his secretary Dr Hubert Luthe, who would later become the bishop of Essen, in his humorous Kölsch dialect: [...] "Hängen se m'r doch ens dat ruude Mäntelsche üm, wer weiß ob et nit dat letzte Mohl is" [...] ("Please wrap the little red coat <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> again, who knows if it will not be the last time you do it?"). But the pope appeared enthusiastic when he read Frings' manuscript, and he gave him a warm welcome. It was recently discovered that Fr. Joseph Ratzinger, Frings' theological expert, or peritus at the Council, had composed the text of the speech for Frings.|$|E
5000|$|... "I was {{determined}} {{to tell the story}} of steel from the viewpoint of an eager immigrant in ‘An American Romance….’ When the picture was previewed in Inglewood, Louis B. Mayer came to me on the sidewalk in front of the theater, put his arm <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> and said, ‘I’ve just seen the greatest picture our company ever made. However, an order came from the New York office to cut half an hour. They cut the human elements of the story instead of the documentary sections, explaining that this was the only way a half hour could be taken out without complications in the musical soundtrack. In other words, the film was edited according to the soundtrack and not according to the inherent story values. At the lowest emotional level I have reached since I have been on Hollywood, I went to my office, packed up and moved out of the studio. The picture was not a box office success. Many of the inhabitants of Hollywood and Beverly Hills have never seen the film and many do not even know it was made. I spent 3 years of my life on the project and MGM spent close to $3,000,000."MGM recorded a loss of $1.7 million on the movie.|$|E
40|$|Tiré du site Internet de Onestar Press: "Following Terri Weifenbach's CAMERA ARTISTS {{portfolio}} {{of the same}} title, we present the portfolio's artist book as a stand alone edition. As Terri Weifenbach observed varying bird activity {{in the back of}} her studio, she captured highly charged movements images in her characteristically delicate manner, interplaying with focal length and a range of natural colors. For her book, Weifenbach decided to isolate the birds from each numbered print found in her CAMERA ARTIST portfolio work of the same name. Cropped, the images are now black and white flying silhouettes distributed along the pages of the book. Acclaimed American poet Matthew Dickmann contributed to the artist book with an original postface : A NOTE ON BEING ALONE AND THE BEATING OF WINGS. Sitting in the backyard at night is not like sitting in a government office waiting to see if you will receive the papers you need to join your family or sitting in a small room with neon lights while an TSA officer looks at your passport and asks what your name is and what your mother and father's names are and asks if this man is your cousin or if this man is your cousin while other people walk around the airport free and upset at the long lines in front of the Starbucks. Loneliness knows if you are missing someone or feeling a little lost with how the night is acting or if your life is in danger, loneliness knows if you are being deported or just not wanting to go back inside and watch television. Back when the dark had some wind inside it I felt very alone. Back when we were just starting to learn to love each other within our new anger I would walk out to the backyard and sit and smoke cigarettes and wish you would come find me, come sit next to me. I like the sounds in the yard I can’t hear. The sound of a wing. Of just part of the wing lifted in the air or resting against the feathery sides of a bird. I don't know the names of any birds but one : the one named shadows-shadows-shadows-shadows-across-the-cool-dark-grass. That one ! Oh, don’t you want to be sitting alone in your backyard right now ? Aren't you like me ? Don't you want to be standing in the dark grass looking up into the sound of the sky and the dark small bodies flying over you ? I am sitting alone right now. I'm punishing myself but also wondering about joy. Who's going to sit next to me ? I can hear the beating of wings all <b>around</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders.</b> It sounds like an ocean. It sounds like the beginning and the end of everything. "...|$|E
