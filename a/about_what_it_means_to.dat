500|$|Billy Curtis, {{director}} of the Gender Equity Resource Center at UC Berkeley, was deeply moved by the preview; but he also looked {{at it from a}} practical perspective: [...] "I knew immediately I could use it as an educational tool for faculty, staff, administration and students.… It doesn't try to represent the entire trans experience, but it… answers some of the most basic questions <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be trans while being this great conversation starter." ...|$|E
500|$|Stacey Abbott of PopMatters cited David Greenwalt's {{statement}} that [...] "Angel {{is about how}} hard it is to be a man." [...] Greenwalt observed that the show raises questions <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be a man and does this not only through the characterization of Angel but also the men around him. He said that like other male characters, taken alone Connor may seem a stereotypical teen boy, but considered with rest of the cast offers a complex image of modern masculinity. Greenwalt also compared Connor's journey with others in terms of identity, which he considers a poignant theme within the series. He found it ironic that Connor who was [...] "initially the most damaged of all the characters", was the only one able to [...] "reconcile his actions and new man existence together" [...] and be at peace with himself in the end.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{have noted}} that her sound is more pop than rock, but Black is militant at her rock and roll image, saying [...] "...I know I'm rock n roll." [...] When asked <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be rock and roll, she stated: [...] Genre-wise, her sound has been called [...] "{{industrial}} pop", a fusion of pop and industrial metal. Her flashy and irreverent image {{has been compared to}} the work of many other artists. Often, comparisons are drawn between her and Lady Gaga, but she has also been compared to Joan Jett, Courtney Love, and Nicki Minaj. Black's two-tone hairstyle and fashion is inspired by both Manson and Spears as well, along with her desire to develop a persona in which a stable duality between [...] "good" [...] and [...] "bad" [...] exists. The former has gained her comparisons to the cartoon character Cruella de Vil. Black disavows the association as completely unfounded, specifically saying, [...] "She's a [...] cartoon. Are you serious?" [...] Black calls her fans [...] "trainwrecks", alluding to the tattoo on the inside of her middle finger.

500|$|Niels Matthijs, {{writing for}} Twitch Film, stated that [...] "It's astounding how van Dormael turns each scene into a unique little {{cinematic}} event. There is hardly filler here, no scenes to drag out the running time or to fill some gaps in between other climaxes. Every scene matters and every scene {{is made to}} look like it matters. The director uses all means to his disposal to keep the viewer engaged and interested {{in the life of the}} main protagonist, Nemo Nobody." [...] Fred Topel, writing for Screen Junkies, praised the film's artistry, saying [...] "All of Nemo's lives are painful. No matter what he chooses, he experiences heartbreak, death of loved ones, his own death, and clinical depression. My future seems brighter, but the film makes the strong point that every experience is worthwhile. The goal isn't to choose the easiest path. It's to live." [...] Chris Holt from Starburst magazine wrote that [...] "Mr. Nobody is a film that is remarkable by its very existence and that in itself is something to be happy about. You may love it you may hate it, but you can bet that you will never forget it." [...] Exclaim!s Robert Bell called the film [...] "a powerful movie <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be alive." ...|$|E

The segment also depicts his budding relationship with Lisa Hallett. Also expanding on Jones's time living in London, the comic The Legacy of Torchwood One! (Torchwood #1) shows how Ianto was taken under the wing of Rupert Howarth, a senior researcher, during his first few weeks at Torchwood One. Ianto's characterisation is explored in The Twilight Streets, in which Ianto sheds some light on the difficulty he had [...] "coming out" [...] as a teenager; Ianto's mother tried to have a conversation with him about it, but he remarks [...] "She didn't work me out, Gwen. No one has. And if I ever do, I'll let you know." [...] He then engages in a diatribe with Gwen <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> him to be bisexual after Gwen jokes to him that he has the [...] "best of both worlds". A scene in David-Lloyd's [...] "Shrouded", in which Ianto is emailing his sister, Owen is seen to wrestle control of the computer and tries to write to her that [...] "I've recently discovered that I'm a Big Old Gay"; Ianto rebukes him. In the storyline's conclusion, an alternate timeline is created where Ianto did not die in the events of Children of Earth.|$|E

[...] NPR's Mara Liasson reported from the J Street conference that took place shortly after Israel's March 17, 2015 elections, in which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised voters {{there would be no}} Palestinian state on his watch. Noting the American Jewish community was as divided as the Israeli voters, Liasson described J Street's role in American Jewish dialog on Israel: [...] "In the debate now raging in the Jewish community in the United States, J Street is the pro-two-state group and anti-Netanyahu, pro-nuclear-deal and generally much more supportive of Obama than AIPAC is." ...|$|E

He told the online journal Inside Higher Ed: [...] "We are, I think, {{a different kind of}} Christian...

From our perspective, that means less nationalism, and a much more global perspective, care for creation.

30|$|Although {{the breadth}} and depth of {{physician}} health and well-being research suggests that a clearer understanding of physician well-being is emerging, {{it has been argued that}} little is known <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> for physicians to be well beyond pathology (Spickard [2001]; Weiner et al. [2001]). This has led to research demands emphasizing the positive elements of physician well-being (Shanafelt et al. [2005]). Consequently, recent movements in positive psychology (e.g., Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi [2000]) were followed in the present study in order to conceptualize well-being as more than the presence or absence of dysfunction (Haworth and Hart [2007]). Two mutually reinforcing conceptualizations of well-being were relevant in the current investigation; psychological and affective well-being.|$|R
40|$|What does talk of {{wellbeing}} offer international development? Four possible {{answers are}} explored.

Second, it draws on positive psychology to offer new ways of measuring what matters most to individuals. Third, it enriches analysis of opportunities and obstacles to policy reform.
