5|$|Sandgrouse is {{the common}} name for Pteroclididae, a family of sixteen species of bird, members of the order Pteroclidiformes. They are {{traditionally}} placed in two genera. The two central Asian species are classified as Syrrhaptes and the other fourteen species, from Africa and <b>Asia,</b> <b>are</b> placed in the genus Pterocles. They are ground dwelling birds restricted to treeless, open country, such as plains, savannahs and semi-deserts. They are distributed across northern, southern and eastern Africa, Madagascar, the Middle East and India through to central Asia. The ranges of the black-bellied sandgrouse and the pin-tailed sandgrouse extend into the Iberian Peninsula and France, and Pallas's sandgrouse occasionally breaks out in large numbers from its normal range in Asia.|$|E
5|$|Wolf populations {{throughout}} Northern and Central <b>Asia</b> <b>are</b> largely unknown, but {{are estimated}} {{in the hundreds}} of thousands based on annual harvests. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, continent-wide extermination of wolves has ceased, and wolf populations have increased to about 25,000–30,000 animals throughout the former Soviet Union. In China and Mongolia, wolves are only protected in reserves. Mongolian populations have been estimated at 10,000–30,000, while the status of wolves in China is more fragmentary. The north has a declining population of an estimated 400 wolves, while Xinjiang and Tibet hold about 10,000 and 2,000 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{three-quarters of}} all extant strepsirrhine species are nocturnal, {{sleeping}} in nests made from dead leaves or tree hollows during the day. All of the lorisoids from continental Africa and <b>Asia</b> <b>are</b> nocturnal, a circumstance that minimizes their {{competition with the}} simian primates of the region, which are diurnal. The lemurs of Madagascar, living {{in the absence of}} simians, are more variable in their activity cycles. The aye-aye, mouse lemurs, woolly lemurs, and sportive lemurs are nocturnal, while ring-tailed lemurs and most of their kin, sifakas, and indri are diurnal. Yet {{some or all of the}} brown lemurs (Eulemur) are cathemeral, which means that they may be active during the day or night, depending on factors such as temperature and predation. Many extant strepsirrhines are well adapted for nocturnal activity due to their relatively large eyes; large, movable ears; sensitive tactile hairs; strong sense of smell; and the tapetum lucidum behind the retina. Among the adapiforms, most are considered diurnal, with the exception of Pronycticebus and Godinotia from Middle Eocene Europe, both of which had large orbits that suggest nocturnality.|$|E

5|$|The {{geographic}} {{distribution of}} malaria within large regions is complex, and malaria-afflicted and malaria-free areas are often found {{close to each}} other. Malaria is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions because of rainfall, consistent high temperatures and high humidity, along with stagnant waters in which mosquito larvae readily mature, providing them with the environment they need for continuous breeding. In drier areas, outbreaks of malaria have been predicted with reasonable accuracy by mapping rainfall. Malaria {{is more common in}} rural areas than in cities. For example, several cities in the Greater Mekong Subregion of Southeast <b>Asia</b> <b>are</b> essentially malaria-free, but the disease is prevalent in many rural regions, including along international borders and forest fringes. In contrast, malaria in Africa is present in both rural and urban areas, though the risk is lower in the larger cities.|$|E
