40|$|Two digging decapod crustaceans, {{the sand}} crab species Lepidopa benedicti and the mole crab species Emerita benedicti, both {{live in the}} swash zone of fine sand beaches. They were {{examined}} for two parasites that infect decapod crustaceans in the region, an unidentified nematode previously shown to infect L. benedicti, and cestode tapeworm larvae, Polypocephalus sp., previously shown to infect shrimp (Litopenaeus setiferus). Lepidopa benedicti were almost always infected with both parasite species, while E.  benedicti were rarely infected with either parasite species. This difference in infection pattern suggests that tapeworms are ingested during sediment feeding in L. benedicti, which E. benedicti avoid by filter feeding. Larger L. benedicti had more Polypocephalus sp. larvae. The thoracic ganglia, which make up the largest proportion of neural tissue, contained the largest numbers of Polypocephalus sp. larvae. Intensity of Polypocephalus sp. infection was not correlated with how long L. benedicti remained above sand in behavioural tests, suggesting that Polypocephalus sp. do not manipulate the sand crabs {{in a way that}} facilitates trophic transmission of the parasite. Litopenaeus setiferus may be a primary host for Polypocephalus sp., and L. benedict may be a secondary, <b>auxiliary</b> <b>host...</b>|$|E

Burroughs informed {{the members of the}} range of offices and positions held by CCBA members, as follows: Judge of the Municipal Court; six corporation counsels; four state representatives; two city prosecutors; one special attorney general; 13 state’s attorneys; one city attorney; one attorney general; one alderman; one assistant to the judge of the court of domestic relations; and one assistant United States attorney. Members in the private sector were general counsel of the Chicago Defender; general counsel and director of the Liberty Life Insurance Company; Binga State Bank; Douglass National Bank; and general counsel of various fraternal organizations and insurance companies. Burroughs completed the furnishing of the permanent headquarters at 4500 S. Michigan and held the annual banquet at the facility. Burroughs presided over the dedication of the law library on September 29, 1928. Burroughs organized a ladies auxiliary to the association, made up of wives of members who assisted in arranging the entertainment for delegates to the National Bar Convention. After the convention, the auxiliary continued to plan receptions and social events at the headquarters. The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>hosted</b> a reception lawn party to honor Cong. Oscar De Priest and his wife. Burroughs increased the number of dues paying members from 108 to 143; and created annual picnics to give the lawyers an opportunity to fraternize. A fellow member hosted the association at his country home in Michigan.|$|R
40|$|AbstractConventional {{agriculture}} {{is based on}} a high level of chemical inputs such as pesticides and fertilisers, leading to serious environmental impacts, health risks and loss of biodiversity. Pesticide reduction is a priority for intensive agricultural systems such as orchards. Reintroducing biodiversity in single crop systems can enhance biological regulations, and contribute to reduce the use of chemicals and to provide additional services such as run-off and erosion control. In tropical wet areas, weed control is difficult to manage without herbicides especially when orchards are not located in easily mechanised areas and when labour force is costly. Cover plants can be easily introduced in orchards and could be efficient in weed control and other functions. Based on this assumption, we developed a specific approach for the choice of adapted cover plants in single crop orchards to control weeds and provide additional ecological services. The approach was undertaken on citrus orchards in the French West Indies. A multicriteria evaluation grid was built to select an “optimal” cover crop. In both Martinique and Guadeloupe, 202 species were first selected in the local flora, and tested on vegetative characteristics. Specific criteria were secondly defined relating to seed availability (limitation of alien species introduction), farm constraints and regulations (no invasive species). Specific features were then determined according to the agronomic potential and ecological services for an optimal cover plant. Criteria included weed control, the ability to control runoff and erosion, water and nutrient competition, pests and natural enemies hosting capacity. The whole evaluation grid combines data from literature, expert assessment and experimental measurements. Optimum cover crop functional groups were defined according to agrosystem and associated objectives. In Guadeloupe, a participatory approach led first to the selection of Fabaceae (Neonotonia wightii) characterized by high <b>auxiliaries</b> <b>hosting</b> services. These services were assessed using a bio-indicator (family of phytoseiidae). In Martinique, the need for a high covering index associated with a low production led to the selection of grasses: Urochloa mozambicensis and three Paspalum species. The multicriteria grid {{can be used as a}} generic tool to select cover plants and can be easily adapted to apply to various cropping systems. Its use for banana cropping system is currently in progress. However, the concept of an optimal single cover plant remains difficult to achieve and the elaboration of a multi-specific cover system is often required to reach the desired efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Phase {{variation}} of type 1 fimbriae of Escherichia coli requires the site-specific recombination {{of a short}} invertible element. Inversion is catalyzed by FimB (switching in either direction) or FimE (inversion mainly from on to off) and is influenced by <b>auxiliary</b> factors integration <b>host</b> factor (IHF) and leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp). These proteins bind to sites (IHF site II and Lrp sites 1 and 2) within the invertible element to stimulate recombination, presumably by bending the DNA to enhance synapses. Interaction of Lrp with a third site (site 3) cooperatively with sites 1 and 2 (termed complex 1) impedes recombination. Inversion is stimulated by the branched-chain amino acids (particularly leucine) and alanine, and according to a current model, the amino acids promote the selective loss of Lrp from site 3 (complex 2). Here we show that the central portion of the fim invertible element, situated between Lrp site 3 and IHF site II, is dispensable for FimB recombination but that this region is also required for full amino acid stimulation of inversion. Further work reveals that the region is likely to contain multiple regulatory elements. Lrp site 3 is shown to bind the regulatory protein with low affinity, and a mutation that enhances binding to this element is found both to diminish the stimulatory effects of IVLA on FimB recombination and to inhibit recombination {{in the absence of}} the amino acids. The results obtained emphasize the importance of Lrp site 3 as a control element but also highlight the complexity of the regulatory system that affects this site...|$|R
40|$|The {{surface coat}} of Trypanosoma cruzi is {{predominantly}} composed of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, {{which have been}} extensively characterized. However, very {{little is known about}} less abundant surface proteins and their role in host-parasite interactions. Here, we described a novel family of T. cruzi surface membrane proteins (TcSMP), which are conserved among different T. cruzi lineages and have orthologs in other Trypanosoma species. TcSMP genes are densely clustered within the genome, suggesting that they could have originated by tandem gene duplication. Several lines of evidence indicate that TcSMP is a membrane-spanning protein located at the cellular surface and is released into the extracellular milieu. TcSMP exhibited the key elements typical of surface proteins (N-terminal signal peptide or signal anchor) and a C-terminal hydrophobic sequence predicted to be a trans-membrane domain. Immunofluorescence of live parasites showed that anti-TcSMP antibodies clearly labeled the surface of all T. cruzi developmental forms. TcSMP peptides previously found in a membrane-enriched fraction were identified by proteomic analysis in membrane vesicles as well as in soluble forms in the T. cruzi secretome. TcSMP proteins were also located intracellularly likely associated with membrane-bound structures. We demonstrated that TcSMP proteins were capable of inhibiting metacyclic trypomastigote entry into host cells. TcSMP bound to mammalian cells and triggered Ca 2 + signaling and lysosome exocytosis, events that are required for parasitophorous vacuole biogenesis. The effects of TcSMP were of lower magnitude compared to gp 82, the major adhesion protein of metacyclic trypomastigotes, suggesting that TcSMP may play an <b>auxiliary</b> role in <b>host</b> cell invasion. We hypothesized that the productive interaction of T. cruzi with host cells that effectively results in internalization may depend on diverse adhesion molecules. In the metacyclic forms, the signaling induced by TcSMP may be additive to that triggered by the major surface molecule gp 82, further increasing the host cell responses required for infection...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBiodiversity has {{dramatically}} decreased {{in the last}} decades: mainly because of urban sprawl {{and the development of}} intensive agriculture. In France, this topic is addressed by the "blue and green belts" measure, which are part of the "Grenelle" laws. The objective of this measure is to preserve or re-create paths to allow animal or vegetal species to move from one habitat to another. We carried out a research project (PASSAGES) as part of a research program funded by the French ministry in charge of ecology (DIVA 3). This project aims to analyse how the green belts measure can be implemented and especially how farming can contribute to preservation of green belts. The objectives of the research are: (i) to identify the different semi-natural elements in farming areas which can contribute to green belts, such as permanent grasslands, hedges, woods, fallows, grass strips, and isolated trees; (ii) to understand farmers' practices and knowledge concerning these elements and the reasons for their practices; and (iii) to point out which characteristics of farms and farmers' practices seem to be favourable for preservation and maintenance of semi-natural features. The methodology combined a cartographic approach to localize semi-natural elements in farming areas with an agronomical and sociological approach to analyse farmers' practices; based on deep interviews among a sample of 20 farmers. The studied area is located in the French Alps, in the periurban context of Grenoble (Valley of Gresivaudan). The farming systems are mainly based on cattle or sheep production in the hillsides and on mixed crops in the plains. The results of this work show that semi-natural elements are differently integrated into farming systems (i) depending on their nature (productive elements such as grasslands versus unproductive ones such as hedges) and (ii) depending on their function and usefulness in farming system (for example isolated trees which can offer shade for cattle or hedges which can <b>host</b> <b>auxiliary</b> insects). However the integration of these elements in farming systems also depends on the territorial context of the farming area as well as on how farmers consider them in a patrimonial, an aesthetic, or a sensitive point of view. Combining those criteria, we identify four different profiles of farmers' behaviours concerning semi-natural elements. These results suggest that the implementation of green belts in agricultural areas should not be only based on technical and economic criteria, but should also take into account both the different types of natural or semi-natural elements to be preserved and the different types of farmers' profiles. Le dispositif réglementaire français de la trame verte vise à maintenir ou à reconstituer les continuités écologiques terrestres, en vue de freiner l'érosion de la biodiversité. Les agriculteurs sont particulièrement interpellés par ce dispositif, car ils gèrent différents éléments semi-naturels susceptibles de contribuer à la trame verte et présents sur leurs parcellaires, tels les haies, les bandes enherbées, les jachères, les arbres isolés, les bois ou les prairies permanentes. L'objectif de cette étude est de mieux comprendre les pratiques des agriculteurs concernant ces éléments semi-naturels ainsi que le raisons de ces pratiques. Elle est basée sur une enquête par entretiens semi-directifs auprès de vingt exploitants agricoles de la vallée du Grésivaudan. Les résultats montrent que les éléments semi-naturels sont différemment intégrés au sein des exploitations agricoles selon leur nature, leur localisation ainsi que les fonctions qui leur sont attribués. Les pratiques de conservation, de suppression et d'entretien de ces éléments varient en fonction du contexte territorial et répondent également à des préoccupations d'ordre esthétique, patrimonial ou sentimental, propre à chaque exploitant. La combinaison de ces critères amène à l'identification de quatre profils-types d'agriculteurs concernant la gestion des éléments semi-naturels susceptibles de contribuer à la trame verte. / Biodiversity {{has dramatically}} decreased in the last decades: mainly because of urban sprawl and the development of intensive agriculture.

40|$|Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate {{intracellular}} protozoan parasite which propagates in {{a complex}} life cycle where infection of Felidae family-members (Cats) results in sexual recombination whereas all other warm-blooded animals are intermediate hosts. Approximately {{one third of the}} human population is estimated to be chronically infected by this parasite. Infection is acquired orally by ingestion of undercooked meat harboring tissue cysts or through accidental intake of oocysts in contaminated foodstuffs. Acute disease is generally mild, but may lead to severe neurological and ocular manifestations in the developing fetus. Chronic infection brings subtle pathology, such as memory impairment and latent anxiety, but may upon reactivation in immunocompromised patients cause potentially lethal toxoplasmic encephalitis. The population structure of Toxoplasma is dominated by three clonal lineages (type I, II, III) and type II predominates in human infections. Immunity to Toxoplasma is biased towards a Th 1 type response which mediates long term protection against reactivated disease. Dendritic cells (DCs) and Natural killer (NK) cells are important players in the acute phase of infection and IL- 12 and IFN-gamma produced by these cells respectively are essential mediators of resistance to the parasite. The overall objective of this work has been to investigate dynamics of parasite dissemination {{and its impact on the}} pathogenesis of infection. We have pursued the hypothesis that Toxoplasma enables successful dissemination and immune evasion by using leukocytes as Trojan horses during infection. Focus has primarily been on parasite-DC interactions in relation to infection with different parasite strains and on NK cell interactions with infected DCs. In summary we have shown the following: 1. Active invasion of DCs and macrophages by Toxoplasma tachyzoites in vitro induces a state of hypermotility in these cells, enabling transmigration across endothelial monolayers in the absence of <b>auxiliary</b> chemotactic stimuli. <b>Host</b> cell hypermotility is induced by all tree archetypical lineages of Toxoplasma but the intensity of the phenotype is clearly higher for type II parasites. Hypermotility further requires an intracellular parasite and can be blocked by PTX treatment which uncouples the signaling pathway of trimeric Gi-proteins. 2. Adoptive transfer of Toxoplasma infected DCs accelerated dissemination of parasites to the spleen, MLN, brain and testis, and resulted in exacerbation of infection compared to inoculation of free parasites. PTX-treatment of infected DCs prior to inoculation reversed the observed enhanced dissemination. All tree archetypical lineages exhibited increased dissemination after adoptive transfer of DC-borne parasite but this mode of dissemination clearly favored type II and type III parasites more than type I in syngenic mice. 3. NK cells are the preferentially infected lymphocyte population shortly after parasite inoculation of mice. Infected DCs, but not infected NK cells, exhibit increased sensitivity to NK cell-mediated killing in vitro. NK cell killing of infected DCs results in the egress of viable parasites and the successive invasion of adjacent NK cells. This mechanism of NK cell infection is perforin-dependent in vitro. The data presented in this thesis shows that parasite strain-dependent manipulation of host cell motility, favors DC-borne parasite dissemination via a Trojan horse type of mechanism, and that NK cell-mediated cellular cytotoxicity may contribute to the parasite s sequestration and mediate immune evasion shortly after infection...|$|R
