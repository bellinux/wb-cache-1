In this test, aniline plus nitric acid <b>are</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the surface of the fruit body, and if positive, a red or orange color forms. Agaricus deserticola has a positive Schaeffer's reaction, similar to species in section Arvensis in the genus Agaricus.|$|E

60|$|Observe {{also that}} the {{evolutionary}} method has invaded each of the concrete sciences in the exact order of their natural place {{in the hierarchy of}} knowledge. It had <b>been</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> astronomy by Kant and Laplace before it <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> geology by Lyell; it had <b>been</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> geology by Lyell before it <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> biology by Darwin; it had <b>been</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> biology (in part, at least) by Lamarck and the Darwins before it <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> psychology by Spencer; and it is only {{at the very end of}} all that it has <b>been</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> sociology and the allied branches of thought by a hundred different earnest workers in contemporary Europe. Each stage helped on the next; each was dependent only on those that went naturally before it, and aided in turn the subsequent development of those that naturally came after it.|$|R

5|$|Known as baka or baka ni viti in Fiji, Ficus obliqua {{has many}} of its parts used in Fijian {{traditional}} medicine, and was previously held to be sacred there. Its white sap {{has been used for}} painful or swollen joints and limbs or boils, or diluted with water and drunk to improve breast milk. Liquid extracted from the root bark has been used for headaches or, when diluted, to improve health after childbirth, and the leaves <b>are</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> venereal lesions. The species has been traditionally used for boils in Samoa and Tonga.|$|E
5|$|LTP can {{be induced}} either by strong tetanic {{stimulation}} {{of a single}} pathway to a synapse, or cooperatively via the weaker stimulation of many. When one pathway into a synapse is stimulated weakly, it produces insufficient postsynaptic depolarization to induce LTP. In contrast, when weak stimuli <b>are</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> many pathways that converge on a single patch of postsynaptic membrane, the individual postsynaptic depolarizations generated may collectively depolarize the postsynaptic cell enough to induce LTP cooperatively. Synaptic tagging, discussed later, may be a common mechanism underlying associativity and cooperativity. Bruce McNaughton argues that any difference between associativity and cooperativity is strictly semantic.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo's {{anatomical}} drawings {{include many}} {{studies of the}} human skeleton and its parts, and of muscles and sinews. He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that <b>are</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> it {{in a manner that}} prefigured the modern science of biomechanics. He drew the heart and vascular system, the sex organs and other internal organs, making one of the first scientific drawings of a fetus in utero. The drawings and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published would undoubtedly have made a major contribution to medical science.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} of T.floccosus {{produces}} oxylipin (biologically active lipids generated from fatty acids) that have antifungal activity against the plant pathogens Colletotrichum fragariae, C.gloeosporioides, and C.acutatum. Extracts of the fungus have shown in standard laboratory tests to have antimicrobial activity against several human pathogenic strains. T.floccosus also contains the spermidine derivative pistillarin, a bioactive compound that inhibits DNA damage by hydroxyl radicals {{generated by the}} Fenton reaction. Pistillarin {{is responsible for the}} green color obtained when iron salts <b>are</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the fruit body surface.|$|E
5|$|To date, {{most of the}} {{evaluation}} of possible roles of pesticides in CCD have relied {{on the use of}} surveys submitted by beekeepers, but direct testing of samples from affected colonies seems likely to be needed, especially given the possible role of systemic insecticides such as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (which <b>are</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the soil and taken up into the plant's tissues, including pollen and nectar), which may be applied to a crop when the beekeeper is not present. The known effects of imidacloprid on insects, including honey bees, are consistent with the symptoms of CCD; for example, the effects of imidacloprid on termites include apparent failure of the immune system, and disorientation.|$|E

5|$|Treatment of HHT is {{symptomatic}} (it {{deals with}} the symptoms rather than the disease itself), {{as there is no}} therapy that stops the development of telangiectasias and AVMs directly. Furthermore, some treatments <b>are</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> prevent the development of common complications. Chronic nosebleeds and digestive tract bleeding can both lead to anemia; if the bleeding itself cannot be completely stopped, the anemia requires treatment with iron supplements. Those who cannot tolerate iron tablets or solutions may require administration of intravenous iron, and blood transfusion if the anemia is causing severe symptoms that warrant rapid improvement of the blood count.|$|E
