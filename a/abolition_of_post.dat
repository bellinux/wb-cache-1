50|$|Haldane {{set up the}} Imperial General Staff. Before Haldane {{there was}} only the Defence Committee of the Cabinet, which only met in emergencies, and the Colonial Defence Committee. Esher had {{recommended}} the setting up of an Army Council and the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>post</b> <b>of</b> Commander-in-Chief, but few of his recommendations had been implemented before the change of government in December 1905. Haldane's reforms also created the Territorial Force of 14 divisions (the original plan was for 28) and 14 mounted Yeomanry brigades at home, the Officer Training Corps and the Special Reserve.|$|R
50|$|Vsevolozhsky ran the Imperial Theatres with a {{determination}} for excellence. In 1886, Vsevolozhsky initiated two major reforms for the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres, namely {{the relocation of}} the Imperial Ballet and Opera from the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre (deemed unsafe by 1886) to the Mariinsky Theatre, and the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>post</b> <b>of</b> First Imperial Ballet Composer, a post previously held by such composers as Léon Minkus and Cesare Pugni.

Lyttelton was promoted to general on 9 April 1906. This was the time of the Haldane Reforms which sought to implement both a new expeditionary force and a new territorial force, but according to Edward M Spiers, Lyttelton was not up to the task – he was [...] "feckless, malleable, and failed to lead the Army Council".|$|R
50|$|From 1948 to 1955, journal {{issues were}} {{published}} bimonthly. In 1956, the Journal published five issues. After several {{changes in the}} number of issues released, the Journal, sometime in the late 1970s, adopted a policy of quarterly publication or four issues in an academic year. Student editorial boards were likewise given greater freedom and independence with the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>post</b> <b>of</b> faculty editor, which was replaced by a faculty adviser. Beginning this period, the issues generally contained legal articles, notes, comments, and book reviews mostly written by members of the judiciary, law professors, legal practitioners, and law students.|$|R

5000|$|Ellis's {{financial}} situation worsened after his father's death in 1816. He {{took a job}} as deputy colonial secretary in the Cape of Good Hope in 1819, and was elected Member of Parliament for [...] in 1820, as a Tory. The two positions proved incompatible, and after some delay his defeated opponent William Augustus Johnson had Ellis removed from parliament, in 1821. Ellis was commissioner of customs 1824-5, clerk of the pells from 1825 until the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>post</b> in 1834, and commissioner of the board of control 1830-5.|$|R

The council consisted of the most wealthy and influential representatives of officers' families. After the complete <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> Hetman <b>post,</b> it was subordinated to the Collegium of Little Russia for a short period.|$|R

5|$|The {{death of}} de Saulles in 1903 {{had led to}} the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>post</b> <b>of</b> Engraver, and coins for George V, who took the throne on Edward's death in 1910, were subject to a design {{competition}} won by Bertram Mackennal, who also prepared the medal for the Coronation. The King apparently liked his work, as he was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order in 1911 and knighted in 1921. The inscription around the left-facing bust reads GEORGIVS V DEI GRA BRITT OMN REX FID DEF IND IMP, while no significant change was made to the reverse design. The new bronze coins were made current by proclamation dated 28 November 1910, effective 1 January 1911.|$|R
50|$|On October 28, 1770, {{at the age}} of twenty-five, Juan Bautista Muñoz was {{appointed}} Cosmografo mayor de Indias (cosmographer-major of the Indies) by King Charles III of Spain. He resigned his chair at Valencia and moved to Madrid to take up his office. The position, created in 1571, had become ill-defined by this time, the Spanish navy had already absconded with most of its scientific functions, and urged the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>post.</b> Muñoz tried to redefine the <b>post,</b> partitioning some <b>of</b> the functions with the naval academy. Despite his efforts, the post was formally abolished by royal edict in 1783, although Muñoz continued to use the title down to his death 1799.|$|R
50|$|Until July 2009, Connaught Hall had a Warden, a Vice-Warden (who was the Warden's deputy, {{served as}} the Senior Treasurer to the Residents' Club, and chaired the Facilities Committee), and four Senior Members. A costs and {{efficiency}} review of the student support structure in the intercollegiate halls lead to the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> the Vice-Warden <b>post</b> {{and an increase in}} the number of Senior Members.

5000|$|In November 2011, {{a salary}} of £100,000 was {{recommended}} by the Mayor's remuneration committee—a rise of £44,000, {{based on the fact}} that the mayor carried out the work of the city's former chief executive, who was paid £175,000. The council was at the time proposing cuts of £70m in services, and the recommendations were criticised by opposing councillors and trade unionists alike. The independence of the committee, which included the vice chancellor of the local university, the head of the chamber of trade and a charity sector worker, was also challenged by the only Conservative councillor [...] "as they worked closely with Sir Peter". [...] The committee, whose report had been leaked, also recommended a reduction in the number of councillors and the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>post</b> <b>of</b> Lord Mayor. Soulsby dismissed the committee the following day, saying it had made [...] "fundamental costing mistakes" [...] and would have led to [...] "totally unacceptable extra costs." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Postage Act {{was passed}} on 17 August 1839 {{in which the}} Penny Postage system was passed. It gave the Treasury until October 1840 to {{introduce}} the system. Public reaction to the interim rate of 4d was unfavourable and they felt cheated that the agreed reduction to the uniform rate of 1d had not taken place. This resulted in the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> the Fourpenny <b>Post</b> and the debut of the Uniform Penny Post on 10 January 1840 when 1d was charged for pre-paid one ounce letters. This {{was followed by the}} issuance of [...] labels to prepay postage in May 1840: the Penny Black and Two Penny Blue stamps.|$|R
5|$|McCay {{became the}} sixth Minister for Defence in four years. His predecessor, Senator Anderson Dawson, had chaired a {{committee}} that had produced a detailed report recommending the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>post</b> <b>of</b> General Officer Commanding Australian Military Forces {{and the creation}} of a Council of Defence, a Naval Board and a Military Board. It fell to McCay to implement the report's recommendations and create a five-man Military Board consisting of himself, a finance member and three military officers. McCay preferred the senior member not be styled the Chief of the General Staff. This change would not be made until 1909. At the first meeting of the Council of Defence, McCay rejected the arguments of Captain William Rooke Creswell for the majority of the defence budget to be spent on supporting the British fleet. In 1905 the Reid government collapsed and McCay became a backbencher once more. Since the Federal parliament sat in Parliament House, Melbourne, McCay lived at the Stock Exchange Club in Collins Street, Melbourne while his family remained in Castlemaine. He maintained a liaison with a married woman, Ella Gavan Duffy.|$|R
2500|$|The Carib Territory {{was officially}} formed by British colonial {{authorities}} in 1903, {{in a remote}} and mountainous area of Dominica's Atlantic coast. [...] Its population remained largely isolated {{from the rest of}} the island throughout most of the 20th century, with only a ceremonial chief and no other formal self-governance. [...] An incident later known as [...] "the Carib War" [...] escalated from a brief skirmish in the Territory in 1930, when law enforcement attempted to crack down on smuggling, to a political controversy ending with the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>post</b> <b>of</b> chief. [...] The Chief was reinstated in 1952, and formalized local government was instituted the same year as part of an island-wide system. [...] The Carib Reserve Act, enacted the year of Dominica's independence in 1978, reaffirmed the Carib Territory's boundaries, its land management, and institutions of local government. [...] In the last decades of the 20th century, modern utilities and infrastructure were finally introduced to the Carib Territory, which also established contacts with foreign governments and other indigenous peoples in the region.|$|R
