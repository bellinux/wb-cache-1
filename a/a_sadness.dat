Paraphrasing Neil Armstrong he described the retirement of the fleet as [...] "This is one small step for a man, but one huge leap backwards for mankind".|$|E
2500|$|.....contemporary {{readers are}} {{reminded}} by Machiavelli's teaching of Thucydides; they find in both authors the same [...] "realism," [...] i.e., the same {{denial of the}} power of the gods or of justice and the same sensitivity to harsh necessity and elusive chance. Yet Thucydides never calls in question the intrinsic superiority of nobility to baseness, a superiority that shines forth particularly when the noble is destroyed by the base. Therefore Thucydides' History arouses in the reader <b>a</b> <b>sadness</b> which is never aroused by Machiavelli's books. In Machiavelli we find comedies, parodies, and satires but nothing reminding of tragedy. One half of humanity remains outside of his thought. There is no tragedy in Machiavelli because he has no sense of the sacredness of [...] "the common." [...] — ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2011 the pop-culture website The A.V. Club {{reviewed}} {{all four}} Chrismukkah episodes for its [...] "TV Club Advent Calendar." [...] The writer noted, [...] "When thinking back on holiday specials of yore for this project, {{the first thing}} that popped into my head wasn't nostalgia for my Rankin/Bass- and Chuck Jones-filled youth. Instead, I immediately focused on a much more recent obsession: Chrismukkah. Created by The O.C.s Seth Cohen ...." [...] The reviewer continued, saying that [...] "A thread of underlying sadness unites all four Chrismukkah episodes, but it's <b>a</b> <b>sadness</b> that begs to be redeemed {{by the end of the}} hour. Chrismukkah is really about traditional Christmas togetherness and your standard happy ending; it's the everyday miracle of people coming together to create something magical." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1956, the Duke, with Kurt Hahn, {{founded the}} Duke of Edinburgh's Award {{in order to}} give young people [...] "a sense of {{responsibility}} to themselves and their communities". In the same year, he also established the Commonwealth Study Conferences. From 1956 to 1957, Philip travelled around the world aboard the newly commissioned HMY Britannia, during which he opened the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne and visited the Antarctic. The Queen and the children remained in the UK. On the return leg of the journey, Philip's private secretary, Mike Parker, was sued for divorce by his wife. As with Townsend, the press still portrayed divorce as a scandal and eventually Parker resigned. He later said that the Duke was very supportive and [...] "the Queen was wonderful throughout. She regarded divorce as <b>a</b> <b>sadness,</b> not a hanging offence." [...] In a public show of support, the Queen created Parker a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.|$|E
2500|$|The {{poetry of}} McGough {{has been the}} subject of {{academic}} study. It has been characterised, at least from its early examples, as being reliant on play with words and their meanings. It has also been noted to exhibit a stylised wit, and, at times, <b>a</b> <b>sadness</b> based on themes of lost youth, unfulfilled relationships, and the downside of city life. The form of some of his verse, it has been claimed, has been influenced by his experience of writing song lyrics. A major critical examination of McGough's poetry, by American academic Ben Wright, was published in 2006. The author's stated aim was [...] "to examine and evaluate the accessibility of Roger McGough's message to a wide, general readership, as well as appraising it by the most rigorous literary standards". McGough's popularity, commercial success, use of humour, and the lack of pretension of his verse has tended to restrict appreciation of his work as [...] "serious poetry". Wright's study challenges this under-appreciation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, the Australian Broadcasting Commission invited Clark to {{give the}} 1976 Boyer Lectures, a series of lectures which were {{broadcast}} and later published as A Discovery of Australia. The Boyer lectures allowed Clark to describe many of the core ideas of his published work and indeed his own life in characteristic style. [...] "Everything a historian writes," [...] he stated for example, [...] "should be a celebration of life, a hymn of praise to life. It should come up from inside {{a man who knows}} all about that horror of the darkness when a man returns to the dust from whence he came, a man who has looked into the heart of that great darkness, but has both a tenderness for everyone, and yet, paradoxically, a melancholy, <b>a</b> <b>sadness,</b> and a compassion because what matters most in life is never likely to happen". Clark's next work, In Search of Henry Lawson (1979), was a reworking of an essay which was originally written in 1964 as a chapter for Geoffrey Dutton's pioneering The Literature of Australia. It was worked up in some haste in response to the desire of the Macmillan publishing house for a new book with which they could cash in on Clark's popularity. Predictably, and with more than usual justification, Clark saw Lawson as another of his tragic heroes, and he wrote with a good deal of empathy of Lawson's losing battle with alcoholism: a fate Clark himself had narrowly avoided by giving up drink in the 1960s. But the book showed both its age and its haste of preparation, and was savaged by Professor Colin Roderick, the leading authority on Lawson, as [...] "a tangled thicket of factual errors, speculation and ideological interpretation".|$|E
