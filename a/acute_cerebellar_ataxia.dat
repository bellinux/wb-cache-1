Presently we described a 4 years old boy with EBV encephalitis that deceased after respiratory distress and cardio-respiratory arrest. At autopsy the most important changes in the brain were focal sub cortical peri-vascular mononuclear inflammation of the cerebral vessels. EBV antigens were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in some cells of the vascular walls and in some glial cells of the brain.

The presence of EBV antigens by immunohistochemistry associated to a scarce inflammatory infiltrate supports the hypothesis that EBV itself {{plays a major role in}} the pathogenesis of EBV encephalitis...|$|R

40|$|Objective Diagnosis of {{sporadic}} <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxia</b> is {{a challenge}} for neurologists. A wide range of potential causes exist, including chronic alcohol use, multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type (MSA-C), and sporadic late cortical cerebellar atrophy. Recently, an autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) mutation was identified in a cohort of patients with non-MSA-C sporadic <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxia.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to genetically screen genes involved in SCA in a Japanese single-hospital cohort. Methods Over an 8 -year period, 140 patients with <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxia</b> were observed. There were 109 patients with sporadic <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxia</b> (no family history for at least four generations, 73 patients with MSA-C, and 36 patients with non-MSA-C sporadic <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxia)</b> and 31 patients with familial <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxia.</b> We performed gene analysis comprising SCA 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 17, 31, and dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) in 28 of 31 non-MSA-C sporadic patients who requested the test. Familial patients served as a control. Results Gene abnormalities were found in 57 % of non-MSA-C sporadic <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxia</b> cases. Among patients with sporadic <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxia,</b> abnormalities in SCA 6 were the most common (36 %), followed by abnormalities in SCA 1 (7. 1 %), SCA 2 (3. 6 %), SCA 3 (3. 6 %), SCA 8 (3. 6 %), and DRPLA (3. 6 %). In contrast, gene abnormalities were found in 75 % of familial <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxia</b> cases, with abnormalities in SCA 6 being the most common (29 %). For sporadic versus familial cases for those with SCA 6 abnormalities, the age of onset was older (69 years vs. 59 years, respectively), and CAG repeat length was shorter (23 vs. 25, respectively) in the former than in the latter (not statistically significant). Conclusion Autosomal-dominant mutations in SCA genes, particularly in SCA 6, are not rare in sporadic <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxia.</b> The reason for the frequency of mutations in SCA 6 remains unclear; however, the reason may reflect a higher age at onset and variable penetrance of SCA 6 mutations...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients with postinfectious <b>acute</b> <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxia</b> using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).  METHODS—Five children with postinfectious <b>acute</b> <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ataxia</b> and five control subjects were examined. The distribution of rCBF was measured by SPECT imaging after intravenous administration of 123 I-IMP (111 MBq). The rCBF ratio—defined as the ratio of rCBF in the region of interest (ROI) to that in the occipital cortex—was calculated for each cortical and subcortical ROI. The mean rCBF ratio of each region was then compared between the ataxic and control subjects. These patients and all control subjects were also evaluated using MRI.  RESULTS—The rCBF ratio was significantly lower in the cerebellum of the ataxic patients than in the cerebellum of the control subjects (p< 0. 05).
