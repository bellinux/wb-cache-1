The former is divided into forty-one chapters, and the latter into forty-eight. Schechter has proved that recension B is cited only by Spanish authors.

25|$|The nine hapaxes, i.e. {{occurring}} just once, are 04 (A5), 05 (B3), 11 (A13), 15 (B8), 17 (A24), 30 (B27), 42 (B9), 43 (B4), 44 (A7). Of {{the eight}} twice-occurring symbols, four (03, 21, 28, 41) occur on side <b>A</b> <b>only,</b> three (09, 16, 20) on side B only, {{and only one}} (14) on both sides.|$|E

25|$|HGPS is {{considered}} autosomal dominant, {{which means that}} {{only one of the}} two copies of the LMNA gene needs to be mutated to produce this phenotype. As the phenotype is caused by an accumulation of the truncated prelamin <b>A,</b> <b>only</b> mutation in one of the two genes is sufficient. At least 16 Other mutations in lamin A/C, or defects in the ZMPSTE24 gene, have been shown to cause HGPS and other progeria-like symptoms, although these are less studied.|$|E
25|$|Epistasis {{occurs when}} the {{expression}} of one gene is modified by another gene. For example, gene <b>A</b> <b>only</b> shows its effect when allele B1 (at another Locus) is present, but not if it is absent. This {{is one of the}} ways in which two or more genes may combine to produce a coordinated change in more than one characteristic (for instance, in mimicry). Unlike the supergene, epistatic genes do not need to be closely linked or even on the same chromosome.|$|E
25|$|For {{children}} 12 {{months of}} age or older, the vaccination is given as a shot into the muscle in two doses 6–18 months apart and should be started before the age 24 months. The dosing is slightly different for adults {{depending on the type}} of the vaccine. If the vaccine is for hepatitis <b>A</b> <b>only,</b> two doses are given 6–18 months apart depending on the manufacturer. If the vaccine is combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B, up to 4 doses may be required.|$|E

Group <b>A</b> <b>only</b> played at the Olimpico and in Puebla (except for the Bulgaria-Italy opening tournament match, which was played in the Azteca), Group B only played at the Azteca and in Toluca (hosts Mexico were part of this group; they played all their group stage matches at the Azteca), Group C played in León and Irapuato, Group D only played in Guadalajara (including the Guadalajara area town of Zapopan; the last match of this group was played in Monterrey), Group E exclusively played in Querétaro and Nezahualcóyotl, and Group F played in the northern city of Monterrey (including the Monterrey area town of San Nicolas de los Garza; the last match of this group was played in Guadalajara). All of the venues listed hosted knockout round matches except the ones in Nezahualcoyotl, Irapuato, Zapopan, Toluca and the Estadio Tecnologico in Monterrey.|$|E
500|$|For many non-coding RNAs, {{including}} tRNA, rRNA, snRNA, and snoRNA, polyadenylation {{is a way}} of {{marking the}} RNA for degradation, at least in yeast. This polyadenylation is done in the nucleus by the TRAMP complex, [...] which maintains a tail that is around 4 nucleotides long to the 3' end. The RNA is then degraded by the exosome. Poly(A) tails have also been found on human rRNA fragments, both the form of homopolymeric (<b>A</b> <b>only)</b> and heterpolymeric (mostly A) tails.|$|E
500|$|The {{structure}} of a nucleic acid molecule consists of a sequence of nucleotides distinguished by which nucleobase they contain. In DNA, the four bases present are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). [...] Nucleic acids have the property that two molecules will only bind to each other to form a double helix if the two sequences are complementary, meaning that they form matching sequences of base pairs, with <b>A</b> <b>only</b> binding to T, and C only to G. [...] Because the formation of correctly matched base pairs is energetically favorable, nucleic acid strands are expected in most cases to bind {{to each other in}} the conformation that maximizes the number of correctly paired bases. [...] The sequences of bases in a system of strands thus determine the pattern of binding and the overall structure in an easily controllable way. [...] In DNA nanotechnology, the base sequences of strands are rationally designed by researchers so that the base pairing interactions cause the strands to assemble in the desired conformation. [...] While DNA is the dominant material used, structures incorporating other nucleic acids such as RNA and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) have also been constructed.|$|E
