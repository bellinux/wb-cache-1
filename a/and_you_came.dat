In 1943, Rand sold the rights {{for a film}} version to Warner Bros., and she returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay. Finishing her work on that screenplay, she was hired by producer Hal Wallis as a screenwriter and script-doctor. Her work for Wallis included the screenplays for the Oscar-nominated Love Letters <b>and</b> <b>You</b> <b>Came</b> Along.

60|$|WELLWYN. [Yielding to a {{pleasant}} memory.] Ah! yes. By the fountain. I was sitting there, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> and ate a roll, and drank the water.|$|E
60|$|ARETHUSA. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> in {{your sleep}} {{to look at}} them. O, poor father! I {{understand}}--I understand you now.|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> then <b>you</b> <b>came</b> {{with those}} red mournful lips, [...] <b>And</b> with <b>you</b> <b>came</b> {{the whole of}} the world's tears [...] And all the trouble of her labouring ships, [...] And all the trouble of her myriad years.|$|R
6000|$|... "What on earth's the matter?" [...] demanded Jimmy. [...] "You {{go out of}} here caroling like a song-bird, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> back moaning like a lost soul. What's happened?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{take it to}} heart, lad," [...] he said kindly. [...] "You {{did your}} best. You were up {{against one of the}} biggest brains of the century. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> very near success. Remember that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How strange," [...] Roger said. [...] "Last time I came {{at night}} through this garden I was a fugitive, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> down to bid me farewell. Now {{it is you}} who have to fly!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not as {{you ought}} not,' he fondly answered. 'You always were his better angel, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> at last as a {{messenger}} of peace. There was relief and hope {{from the moment}} that he knew you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll <b>come</b> down <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> up. I {{must go to}} Daisy now;" [...] and Demi {{departed}} {{to rehearse}} {{the tale of the}} nineteen cats, with the exciting boot-and-barrel episodes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There are you, Charley, working your way, {{in secret}} from father, at the school; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> get prizes; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> go on better <b>and</b> better; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> to be a--what {{was it you}} called it when {{you told me about}} that?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{father and}} his friends have gone off to secure my uncle’s treasure, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> {{straight}} on here," [...] she cried, hotly. [...] "Do {{you think that there}} is no end to his good-nature?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did think}} so, {{but as they}} never said {{anything}} about it, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> away, I supposed I was mistaken. And Jo wouldn't be kind to you? Why, I was sure she loved you dearly." ...|$|E
6000|$|Shame {{upon you}}, Robin, [...] Shame upon you now! [...] Kiss me would you? {{with my hands}} [...] Milking the cow? [...] Daisies grow again, [...] Kingcups blow again, [...] <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> and kiss'd me milking the cow.|$|E

60|$|Trick. You must venture that: When we are rid of Limberham, 'tis but {{slipping}} into your chamber, throwing off your black perriwig, and riding suit, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> out an Englishman. No more; he's here.|$|R
6000|$|... "You come pretty often, Abe Kauffman," [...] he muttered. [...] "Suspenders? Bah! I only buy 'em once a year, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> around ev'ry {{month or}} so. I don't think it pays {{you to keep}} pesterin' merchants." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> here {{to educate}} yourselves; to educe and bring out your own powers of perceiving, judging, reasoning; to improve yourselves {{in the art}} of all arts, which is, the art of learning. That is mental education.|$|R
6000|$|Presently Muriel {{gave him}} a {{careless}} glance. [...] "Helen told me she met you in the hills <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> over to the hall where she and Alison Jardine stopped. Now you have had an opportunity of correcting your first impression, {{what do you think}} of her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Three Points laid for us," [...] he said. [...] "This man, Jack Repetto, was bossing the crowd. The Kid put {{one over}} on to Jack Repetto's chin, {{and we were}} asking him a few {{questions}} when the rest came back, and started shooting.

6000|$|... "The Three Points laid for us," [...] he said. [...] "Jack Repetto was bossing the crowd. I don't {{know who}} the rest were.

6000|$|... "By what right?" [...] Carrier put a leg out of bed. [...] "So you {{question}} my right, do you? You have so imposed yourself upon folk {{that you are}} given powers, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> here to air them, by--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Nathan," [...] said Rollo, [...] "I {{will lie}} {{down upon the}} steps, and make believe I am a bear gone to sleep, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> poke me with your stick, and then I will growl at you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, I'm not worrying. I {{has that}} piece {{in my pocket}} the day I went down to see old Stephen Chippering, when he made me agent, and I've kept it ever since.

6000|$|... 'I {{can account}} for that,' said Lady Kirkaldy. 'My sister had been ordered to Madeira in the autumn, and there they {{remained}} till her death in May. All the letters were sent to my mother, {{and she did not}} think fit to forward, or open, any bearing on the subject. In the meantime Mr. Egremont was presented to the family living, and on his return moved to Bridgefield Egremont. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> here?' ...|$|E
6000|$|George's {{meeting with}} Mr. Will {{was not known}} for some days in Dean Street, for he {{did not wish to}} disturb those kind folks with his quarrel; but when the ladies were made aware of it, you may be sure there was a great flurry and to-do.

6000|$|... "You {{run away}} from a good ’ome," [...] he ses, [...] "and the best wife in Wapping, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> back <b>and</b> frighten people ’arf out o’ their lives. I never see such a feller in all my born days." ...|$|R
6000|$|He was tall, was my Jack, [...] And {{as strong}} as a tree. [...] Thar's his gun on the rack,-- [...] Jest <b>you</b> heft it, <b>and</b> see. [...] <b>And</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>come</b> a courtin' his widder! Lord! where can that critter, [...] Sal, be! ...|$|R

"Pray sit down, Mr Willders," [...] entreated Miss Tippet earnestly; [...] "I {{should like}} so much to hear how you did it from your own lips, {{and how you can}} {{possibly}} venture up such dreadful things, just like going up the outside of the Monument.

6000|$|... 'It was {{all there}} was,' {{returned}} my aunt. 'I sold three, myself. One, I paid for your articles, Trot, my dear; {{and the other two}} I have by me. When I lost the rest, I thought it wise to say nothing about that sum, but to keep it secretly for a rainy day. I wanted to see how you would come out of the trial, Trot; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> out nobly--persevering, self-reliant, self-denying! So did Dick. Don't speak to me, for I find my nerves a little shaken!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet why leave us, Colonel Howard? It is {{long since}} we have seen you in the cloisters, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> know <b>you</b> <b>come</b> as a father; tarry, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> may yet add confessor to the title." ...|$|R

The light sherry at 26s., the {{champagne}} at 42s.; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> {{are not to}} go beyond 36s. for the claret and port after dinner.

6000|$|... "I {{tried to}} get a wink of sleep. You know I can't sleep o' nights. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> jabbering near the door here like a {{blooming}} lot of old women.... You think yourselves good shipmates. Do you?... Much you care for a dying man!" ...|$|R
