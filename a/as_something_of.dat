5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a bit player in their lives. As I got {{further into the}} Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is {{different}} from liking them as characters, of course—I {{wanted to have a}} character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the scientists could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E
5|$|In United States {{railroad}} terminology, a troop sleeper was {{a railroad}} passenger car {{which had been}} constructed to serve <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a mobile barracks (essentially, a sleeping car) for transporting troops over distances sufficient to require overnight accommodations. This method allowed part of the trip to be made overnight, {{reducing the amount of}} transit time required and increasing travel efficiency.|$|E
5|$|The {{pursuit of}} full {{dominion}} status was then regarded <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a non-issue by most Southern Rhodesian politicians. They viewed themselves as virtually independent already; they lacked only the foreign affairs portfolio and taking this on would mean having to shoulder the expense for high commissions and embassies overseas. Huggins and the United Party instead pursued an initially semi-independent Federation with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, two protectorates directly administered from London, {{with the hope}} of ultimately creating a single, united dominion in south-central Africa.|$|E

50|$|A {{secondary}} English meaning {{which developed}} in the 18thC was a curio or art-object - <b>as</b> being <b>something</b> <b>of</b> value in itself. Thus Horace Walpole could refer to “my books, my virtus and my other follies”.|$|R
5|$|Anti-Earp {{writers and}} {{researchers}} use Frank Waters' Earp Brothers of Tombstone, {{as their primary}} source for material that presents Wyatt Earp <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a villainous monster, aided and abetted by his brothers who were almost brutes. Waters detested the Earps so badly that he presented a book that was terribly flawed, poorly edited, and brimming with prevarications. In his other work, Waters is poetic. In the Earp Brothers of Tombstone, he {{is little more than}} a tabloid hack, trying to slander someone he dislikes. To date, no reason has been uncovered for the bias Frank Waters exhibited against Wyatt Earp and his brothers.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{received}} a formal education at Diocletian's court, {{where he learned}} Latin literature, Greek, and philosophy. The cultural environment in Nicomedia was open, fluid and socially mobile, and Constantine could mix with intellectuals both pagan and Christian. He may have attended the lectures of Lactantius, a Christian scholar of Latin in the city. Because Diocletian did not completely trust Constantius—none of the Tetrarchs fully trusted their colleagues—Constantine was held <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a hostage, a tool to ensure Constantius's best behavior. Constantine was nonetheless a prominent member of the court: he fought for Diocletian and Galerius in Asia, and served {{in a variety of}} tribunates; he campaigned against barbarians on the Danube in 296AD, and fought the Persians under Diocletian in Syria (297AD) and under Galerius in Mesopotamia (298–299AD). By late 305AD, he had become a tribune of the first order, a tribunus ordinis primi.|$|E
5|$|Contemporaries {{regarded}} Organt <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a salacious novelty and it {{was quickly}} banned, but censors who tried to confiscate it discovered that few copies were available anywhere. It did not sell well and resulted in a financial loss for its author. The public's taste for literature had changed in the prelude to the Revolution, and Saint-Just's taste changed with it: aside from a few pages of an unfinished novel found amidst his papers {{at the end of}} his life, Saint-Just devoted his future writing entirely to undecorated essays of social and political theory. With his previous ambitions of literary and lawyerly fame unfulfilled, Saint-Just directed his focus on the single goal of revolutionary command.|$|E
25|$|However, Verdi {{had given}} some {{consideration}} {{of the idea of}} adapting one of the librettos written by Temistocle Solera in earlier years, librettos which music historian David Kimball regards <b>as</b> having <b>something</b> <b>of</b> grand opera in their structure.|$|R

40|$|The {{distinction}} between liberalism and republicanism lies basically {{on the way}} politics is conceived: <b>as</b> <b>something</b> instrumental or <b>as</b> <b>something</b> constitutive <b>of</b> the practical condition of the human being. This constitutive conception of politics is {{the very essence of}} republicanism. All other features of republicanism stem from this, receiving from it their specific republican meaning...|$|R
5|$|Head I, {{completed}} late in 1948, {{is considered}} {{more successful than}} Head II. Although it is well-regarded critically, Head II is seen <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a creative cul-de-sac, while Heads III, IV and V are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards HeadVI. It is exceptional in Bacon's oeuvre that works of their relative poor quality survive; he was ruthlessly self-critical and often slashed or abandoned canvasses before they were completed. When pressed again by Brausen in 1953 to produce works for a New York show {{that she had been}} publicising for a year, he was full of doubt and destroyed most of what he had been working on, including several other popes.|$|E
5|$|The roman {{designs of}} Garamond which are his most imitated {{were based on}} a font cut around 1495 for the Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by {{engraver}} Francesco Griffo. This was first used in the book De Aetna, a short work by poet and cleric Pietro Bembo which was Manutius' first printing in the Latin alphabet after a long series of publications of classics of Greek literature that won him an international reputation. Historian Beatrice Warde has assessed De Aetna <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a pilot project, a small book printed to a higher standard than Manutius' norm. Among other details, this font popularised the idea that in printing the cross-stroke of the 'e' should be level instead of slanting upwards to the right like handwriting, something imitated in almost all type designs since.|$|E
5|$|Tudor's {{plan was}} to export ice as a luxury good to wealthy members of West Indies and the {{southern}} US states, where he hoped they would relish the product during their sweltering summers; conscious of the risk that others might follow suit, Tudor hoped to acquire local monopoly rights in his new markets {{in order to maintain}} high prices and profits. He started by attempting to establish a monopoly on the potential ice trade in the Caribbean and invested in a brigantine ship to transport ice bought from farmers around Boston. At the time, Tudor was regarded by the business community at best <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> an eccentric, and at worst a fool.|$|E

We {{tend to think}} <b>of</b> them <b>as</b> either <b>something</b> <b>of</b> the past, or something that only happens far away. In this book, Rai reminds us that arranged marriages are happening in neighbourhoods like ours." ...|$|R
50|$|The A90 was updated for autumn 1956 as the A95. Along {{with more}} power, the A95 {{was longer and}} now offered an estate model. Overdrive and an {{automatic}} transmission were new <b>as</b> well, <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a novelty in British cars of the time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first season}} was {{suggested}} <b>as</b> being <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a failure for producer Derrick Goodwin {{in the book}} On The Buses: The Complete Story by Craig Walker. Walker describes the series as a 'short-lived affair' and that 'six episodes later the sitcom ended.' ...|$|R
25|$|Banting and Best {{never worked}} well with Collip, {{regarding}} him <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> an interloper, and Collip left the project soon after.|$|E
25|$|In {{what was}} seen <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> {{a tribute to}} Glory's past, the 2009–10 strip reverted to the {{vertical}} stripes, similar to what {{can be found on}} Glory's jersey of 1996–97.|$|E
25|$|He was {{selected}} {{in a number}} of Test squads during the summer of 2006, but only played in one Test against Sri Lanka, coming to be regarded <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a perennial 12th man.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{political}} parties will provide transport for voters {{to and from}} the voting centre. While campaigning is not allowed on election day, transportation is seen <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a social service, especially since many people did not have a personal means of conveyance until the last decade or two, as of 2004.|$|E
25|$|The LLLL, {{seen as a}} model {{institution}} of class collaboration, survived after the termination of World War I in November 1918 — having largely ameliorated the bitter strife between workers and capitalists that had swept the industry over previous years. The organization was seen <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> value by {{both sides of the}} production process.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, {{working at}} the Bateau Lavoir, Picasso {{continued}} to explore new directions; portraying monumental female figures standing in abstract interior spaces. Now, {{in addition to the}} bathers of Cézanne, Spanish romanesque art and Iberian sculpture provide a prominent influences for Picasso. Around this time he also created a self-portrait depicting himself <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a latter-day Cézanne.|$|E
5000|$|German {{linguistics}} {{is traditionally}} called philology in Germany, <b>as</b> there is <b>something</b> <b>of</b> {{a difference between}} philologists and linguists. It is roughly divided as follows: ...|$|R
25|$|In the Parthenon model, {{separate}} philosophical insights {{are placed}} one after another, like columns, and only afterwards are they united under a roof consisting of general principles or themes. That way, when the philosophical ground crumbles, <b>something</b> Nozick regards <b>as</b> likely, <b>something</b> <b>of</b> interest and beauty remains standing.|$|R
5000|$|Known for his vocal {{strength}} (hence the [...] "Mighty" [...] prefix in his stage handle) {{and sharp}} visual presentation (custom tailored suits, shirts, capes, and footwear), he was marketed <b>as</b> a <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a [...] "sex symbol" [...] {{at the height}} of his recording career in the mid-to-late 1970s.|$|R
25|$|At {{around this}} time Henry Vaughan left 31 watercolours by J.M.W. Turner with the {{requirement}} that they could only be exhibited in January, this {{to protect them from}} the ill-effects of sunlight. Though modern lighting technology has made this stipulation unnecessary, the Gallery continues to restrict viewing of the Vaughan bequest to January and the exhibition is treated <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> an occasion.|$|E
25|$|After {{this basic}} training, {{the third group}} were {{assigned}} specializations, with Collins receiving his first choice of pressure suits and EVA (spacewalk). His job was to monitor the development and act <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a go-between for the Astronaut Office and the contractors. As such he was annoyed when during the secretive planning of Ed White's EVA on Gemini 4, he was not involved.|$|E
25|$|Coming off {{a regular}} season conference title, {{the team was}} {{obviously}} dejected in not going further, and this served <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a chip of their shoulder heading into the next season. In the stands, the club experienced another solid but unspectacular year averaging 5,983 (announced), but dipped well below that during the post season, seeing only 4,638 {{show up for the}} conference final game versus St. Louis.|$|E
