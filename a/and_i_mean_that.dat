[...] Canham told Elliott he could stay on as coach if he wanted, but Canham could not promise him that the job of associate athletic director would still be open in another couple of years. [...] Canham said: [...] "Bump smiled at me and said, ‘I don’t {{have to think about}} it.’ [...] He was ready to get out. [...] I did not force him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> in all honesty. [...] But the job had ceased to be fun for him." ...|$|E
500|$|Fearnet critic Alyse Wax wrote [...] "This episode made {{my brain}} hurt. [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> in the nicest way possible. They were {{throwing}} {{a lot of}} weird shit at us. It was great because I feel like we are finally getting answers, like we will finally get some closure, and just maybe {{get rid of the}} Red universe stiffs. This episode was so ridiculously dense I am sure I missed some of the deeper scientific facts. I got the gist of it, though, and frankly, I much prefer these jam-packed episodes. I like when the puzzle pieces start falling into place. It's calming." [...] SFScope's Sarah Stegall believed the episode [...] "start out interestingly enough", but unlike other reviewers, she was very critical of the First People mythology, stating [...] "This is where my disbelief not only stopped being suspended, it got up {{and walked out of the}} room... I still don't like the premise of the evolution of an entire hominid species that left not one single solitary fossil behind. It's more like fantasy than science fiction." [...] Stegall praised Torv's acting as she plays [...] "two people very subtly, very convincingly", and concluded her review by commenting she will continue to watch the series because she trusts the writers will [...] "supply us with plausible answers from time to time", but is [...] "losing some respect for it".|$|E
2500|$|Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 3 stars out of 4 and said, [...] "Even with its big-screen {{pyrotechnics}} and its feature-length running time, Star Trek Beyond plays like an extended version {{of one of}} the better episodes from the original series, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> in the best possible way." [...] Scott Collura of IGN awarded the film 8.4/10, describing it as being:"terrific, a fun and exciting entry in the series that balances subtle fan service while also feeling fresh and modern; Star Trek Beyond is the perfect way to celebrate the series’ 50th anniversary." [...] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said the screenplay by Simon Pegg and Doug Jung [...] "injects a welcome strain of humor that's true to the original Gene Roddenberry creation, delivering nostalgia without stiff veneration", and went on by saying, [...] "While Beyond won't unseat 1982's thrilling [...] as the gold standard for Star Trek movies, it's a highly entertaining entry guaranteed to give the franchise continuing life." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Variety, in an otherwise positive review, described the film being: [...] "a very familiar, old-fangled, no-mystery structure, and that’s because it’s basically the Star Trek version of an interplanetary action film, with a plot that doesn’t take you to many new frontiers." [...] Furthermore, he called Star Trek Beyond [...] "a somewhat diverting place holder, but one hopes that the next Star Trek movie will {{have what it takes to}} boldly go where no Star Trek movie has gone before." [...] Mark Hugues of Forbes said, [...] "Star Trek Beyond is the third-best Star Trek film of all time, creating the sort of emotional connection and familiar, powerful characterizations we loved in the original series while delivering top-notch action and the best Star Trek movie villain since First Contacts Borg Queen." ...|$|E

He expected to hear from Gordon {{as soon as this}} interesting trio should reach England, but the first notification he received came from a Parisian hotel. It came to him {{in the shape of a}} very short note, in the morning, shortly before lunch, and was to the effect that his friends had alighted in the Rue de la Paix the night before.|$|E

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> (also spelled I&I, InI, or Ihi yahnh Ihi) is {{a complex}} term, {{referring}} to the oneness of Jah (God) and every human. In the words of Rastafari scholar E. E. Cashmore: [...] "I <b>and</b> <b>I</b> is an expression to totalize the concept of oneness. 'I and I' as being the oneness of two persons. So God is within {{all of us and}} we're one people in fact. <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> God is within all men. The bond of Ras Tafari is the bond of God, of man." [...] The term is often used in place of [...] "you and I" [...] or [...] "we" [...] among Rastafari, implying that both persons are united under the love of Jah. Also in the Twi language (in which patois uses a lot of Twi loan words) of Ghana, Me ne me is also said, which literally translate to [...] "I and I".|$|R
6000|$|These, Sir, are the {{outlines}} of the plan I mean to follow, in suppressing these two large subordinate treasuries. I now come to another subordinate treasury,--I mean that of the paymaster of the pensions; for which purpose I reënter the limits of the civil establishment: I departed from those limits in pursuit of a principle; and, following the same game in its doubles, I am brought into those limits again. That treasury and that office I mean to take away, and to transfer the payment of every name, mode, and denomination of pensions to the Exchequer. The present course of diversifying the same object can answer no good purpose, whatever its use may be to purposes of another kind. There are also other lists of pensions; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> they should all be hereafter paid at one and the same place. The whole of the new consolidated list I mean to reduce to 60,000l. a year, which sum I intend it shall never exceed. I think that sum will fully answer as a reward to all real merit and a provision for all real public charity that is ever like to be placed upon the list. If any merit of an extraordinary nature should emerge before that reduction is completed, I have left it open for an address of either House of Parliament to provide for the case. To all other demands it must be answered, with regret, but with firmness, [...] "The public is poor." ...|$|E

5000|$|Initially titled A Couple of Dicks, {{the title}} went through various name changes before release, first as A Couple of Cops [...] {{and then to}} Cop Out [...] with the final title {{emerging}} from Smith's belief that changing the original title was a [...] "cop out" [...] The film marks the first movie that Smith directed {{that he did not}} write. The Cullen brothers are dialogue crazy — the whole movie is like cops who are practically married but not actually, <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>that's</b> right up my alley. It's like Dante and Randalas cops. Kevin Smith, on why he wanted to direct the film The studio requested Smith to storyboard the entire film; Smith agreed, and he and Dave Klein, the director of photography, reviewed the results with Warner Bros. two months in advance.

5000|$|The screenwriter Fuji Yahiro said of Raizō’s manners, “Regardless of {{to whom he}} was speaking, he {{was always}} polite and proper, without arrogance or effusive emotion,” and that shone through in his acting style.

5000|$|Tampa Bay's WMNF 88.5FM has {{had similar}} {{comments}} about Gloff's eccentric and engaging performance style: [...] "With {{a voice that}} recalls Michael Stipe in a helium cloud and a piano-driven songwriting style that hovers somewhere between Ben Folds' snarky epics and R.E.M.'s rolling diary entries, one of Tampa's favorite eccentrics is often a breathtaking talent, a man capable of gut-wrenching crescendos and swoony melodies.

Film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum in Entertainment Weekly, however, said, [...] "There’s something deafening and reckless and hotdogging about Drop Zone, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> as a compliment. This macho action fantasy from subculture specialist John Badham (Saturday Night Fever (1977), WarGames (1983)) {{is set in}} the daredevil society of sky divers, where Pete Nessip (Wesley Snipes), an unlikely federal marshal who is the last man around you’d expect to see pulling a rip cord, throws in with a band of professional plane leapers based in swampy Florida." ...|$|E
