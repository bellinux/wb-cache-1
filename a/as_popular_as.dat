5|$|In 1935, Heyer's thrillers began {{following}} {{a pair of}} detectives named Superintendent Hannasyde and Sergeant (later Inspector) Hemingway. The two were never <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> <b>as</b> other contemporary fictional detectives such as Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot and Dorothy L. Sayers's Lord Peter Wimsey. One of the books featuring Heyer's characters, Death in the Stocks, was dramatized in New York City in 1937 as Merely Murder. The play focused on the comedy rather than the mystery, and it closed after three nights.|$|E
5|$|Jemima Puddle-Duck was popular, almost <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> <b>as</b> Peter Rabbit, {{and became}} the subject of {{ancillary}} merchandise. She is depicted in one of the four well known endpapers of the Potter books, and was featured on a Christmas card for the Invalid Children's Aid Association. She became the principal character in an unpublished painting book describing the livestock at Hill Top, and appeared in Peter Rabbit's Painting Book and Tom Kitten's Painting Book before being given her own painting book, Jemima Puddle-Duck's Painting Book in 1925, composed grudgingly in response to public demand for yet another book.|$|E

5|$|Riley wrote {{gentle and}} romantic poems {{that were not}} in dialect. They {{generally}} consisted of sonnets and were strongly influenced by the works of John Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson. His standard English poetry was never <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> <b>as</b> his Hoosier dialect poems. Still less popular were the poems Riley authored in his later years; most were to commemorate important events of American history and to eulogize the dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} date that appears on Ruisdael's paintings and etchings is 1646. Two years after this date he {{was admitted to}} membership of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke. By this time landscape paintings were <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> <b>as</b> history paintings in Dutch households, though {{at the time of}} Ruisdael's birth, history paintings appeared far more frequently. This growth in popularity of landscapes continued throughout Ruisdael's career.|$|E
5|$|While {{the first}} series was not <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> <b>as</b> its predecessor, the second series was more successful. It was {{broadcast}} {{during the winter}} months, from September to April, with Fully Booked replacing it during the summer. New episodes of the Rugrats were shown. The series went out opposite ITV's What's Up Doc? but during its third series issues were raised by the ITC, {{and a number of}} people left including Don Austen and John Eccleston (Bro and Bro's puppeteers) who defected to Live & Kicking to star as a couple of leprechaun brothers Sage & Onion.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide range}} of birds were eaten, {{including}} swans, peafowl, quail, partridge, storks, cranes, larks, linnets and other songbirds that could be trapped in nets, and just about any other wild bird that could be hunted. Swans and peafowl were domesticated to some extent, but were only eaten by the social elite, and more praised for their fine appearance as stunning entertainment dishes, entremets, than for their meat. As today, geese and ducks had been domesticated but were not <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> <b>as</b> the chicken, the fowl equivalent of the pig. Curiously enough the barnacle goose was believed to reproduce not by laying eggs like other birds, but by growing in barnacles, and was hence considered acceptable food for fast and Lent. But at the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), Pope Innocent III explicitly prohibited the eating of barnacle geese during Lent, arguing that they lived and fed like ducks and so were of the same nature as other birds.|$|E
5|$|Although {{association}} {{football was}} not <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> <b>as</b> rugby in the Rhondda {{in the early}} 20th century, after the 1920s several notable players had emerged from the area. Two {{of the most important}} players both came from the village of Ton Pentre; Jimmy Murphy was capped 15 times for Wales, and in 1958 managed both the Welsh national team and Manchester United. Roy Paul, also from Ton Pentre, led Manchester City to two successive FA Cup finals in 1955 and 1956 and gained 33 Welsh caps. Alan Curtis, who was best known for representing Swansea City and Cardiff City, came from the neighbouring village of Pentre, and in an 11-year international career won 35 caps for Wales scoring 6 goals.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{started his}} career working for his father, Richard Carte, in the music {{publishing}} and musical instrument manufacturing business. As a young man, he conducted and composed music, but he soon turned to promoting the entertainment careers of others through his management agency. Carte believed that a school of wholesome, well-crafted, family-friendly, English comic opera could be <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> <b>as</b> the risqué French works dominating the London musical stage in the 1870s. To that end, he brought together the dramatist W. S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan and, together with his wife Helen Carte, he nurtured their collaboration {{on a series of}} thirteen Savoy operas. He founded the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and built the state-of-the-art Savoy Theatre to host the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.|$|E
50|$|While Thai {{classical}} music was somewhat discouraged as being unmodern and backward looking during Thailand's aggressively nationalistic modernization policies of mid-20th century, the classical arts have benefited recently from increased governmental sponsorship and funding <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> interest <b>as</b> expressed in {{such films as}} Homrong: The Overture (2003), a popular fictionalized biography of a famous traditional xylophone (ranat ek) performer.|$|R

5|$|In 1914, for {{the first}} time in many years, Robey {{appeared}} in a Christmas pantomime as a male when he was engaged to play the title role in Sinbad the Sailor; Fred Emney Sr played the dame role. Although the critics were surprised by the casting, it appealed to audiences, and the scenes featuring Robey and Emney together proved the most memorable. During the war the demand for light entertainment in the English provinces guaranteed Robey frequent bookings and a regular income. His appearances in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle and Glasgow were <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> <b>as</b> his annual performances in Birmingham. His wife Ethel accompanied him on these tours and frequently starred alongside him.|$|E
5|$|Johann Tetzel {{responded to}} the Theses by calling for Luther to be burnt for heresy and having theologian Konrad Wimpina write 106 theses against Luther's work. Tetzel defended these in a disputation before the University of Frankfurt on the Oder in January 1518. 800 copies of the printed disputation were sent to be sold in Wittenberg, but {{students}} of the University seized them from the bookseller and burned them. Luther became increasingly fearful that the situation was out of hand {{and that he would}} be in danger. To placate his opponents, he published a Sermon on Indulgences and Grace, which did not challenge the pope's authority. This pamphlet, written in German, was very short and easy for laypeople to understand. Luther's first widely successful work, it was reprinted twenty times. Tetzel responded with a point-by-point refutation, citing heavily from the Bible and important theologians. His pamphlet was not nearly <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> <b>as</b> Luther's. Luther's reply to Tetzel's pamphlet, on the other hand, was another publishing success for Luther.|$|E
5|$|Lord Thomas Bulkeley {{bought the}} castle from the Crown in 1807 for £735, {{incorporating}} {{it into the}} park that surrounded his local residence, Baron Hill. By then the castles of North Wales had become attractive locations for visiting painters and travellers, who considered the ivy-clad ruins romantic. Although not <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> <b>as</b> other sites in the region, Beaumaris formed part of this trend and was visited by the future Queen Victoria in 1832 for an Eisteddfod festival and it was painted by J. M. W. Turner in 1835. Some of the castle's stones may have been reused in 1829 to build the nearby Beaumaris Gaol.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, the {{official}} {{term for a}} barber is hairdresser; barber is only a popular title for men's hairdressers, although not <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> now <b>as</b> {{it was in the}} middle of the 20th century. Most would work in a hairdressing salon.|$|R

50|$|While Thai {{classical}} music was somewhat discouraged as being outmoded and backward-looking during Thailand's aggressively nationalistic modernization {{policies of the}} mid-twentieth century, the classical arts have benefited recently from increased governmental sponsorship and funding <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> interest <b>as</b> expressed in such films as Homrong: The Overture (2003), a popular fictionalized biography of a famous early 20th century ranat ek player and composer Luang Pradit Phairao.|$|R
5|$|On 31 July 1879, {{the last}} day of their {{agreement}} with Carte, the directors of the Comedy Opera Company attempted to repossess the Pinafore set by force during a performance, causing a celebrated fracas. Carte's stagehands managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery and props. The Comedy Opera Company opened a rival production of H.M.S. Pinafore in London, but it was not <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> <b>as</b> the D'Oyly Carte production and soon closed. Legal action over the ownership of the rights ended in victory for Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan. From 1 August 1879, the new company, later called the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, became the sole authorised producer of the works of Gilbert and Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|The {{examination}} {{consists of}} six problems. Each problem is worth seven points, so the maximum total score is 42 points. No calculators are allowed. The examination is held over two consecutive days; each day the contestants have four-and-a-half hours to solve three problems. The problems chosen are from various areas {{of secondary school}} mathematics, broadly classifiable as geometry, number theory, algebra, and combinatorics. They require no knowledge of higher mathematics such as calculus and analysis, and solutions are often short and elementary. However, they are usually disguised {{so as to make}} the solutions difficult. Prominently featured are algebraic inequalities, complex numbers, and construction-oriented geometrical problems, though in recent years the latter has not been <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> <b>as</b> before.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} {{of the game and}} of its characters led Valve to develop merchandise for Portal made available through its online Steam store. Some of the more popular items were the Weighted Companion Cube plush toys and fuzzy dice. When first released, both were sold out in under 24 hours. Other products available through the Valve store include T-shirts and Aperture Science coffee mugs and parking stickers, and merchandise relating to the phrase the cake is a lie, which has become an internet meme. Wolpaw noted they did not expect certain elements of the game to be <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> <b>as</b> they were, while other elements they had expected to become fads were ignored, such as a giant hoop that rolls on-screen during the final scene of the game that the team had named Hoopy.|$|E

5|$|Tour {{operators}} {{continue to}} advertise the island as a lost paradise surrounded by mangroves where travellers' exotic dreams come to life, but {{this type of}} discovery tourism is not <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> <b>as</b> traditional beach-related tourism. Thus, visitors from France, Spain, and Italy often combine tours of the cases á impluvium in Enampore or Mlomp with {{a few days of}} relaxation in Carabane. The area is also very conducive to the interests of fishing enthusiasts. Along the beach, small stalls offer traditional crafts and clothes at prices lower than those in Cap Skirring or Saly. Badji Malang, a local painter, potter, sculptor, and poet, has created a camp in the area.|$|E
5|$|Upon its discovery, the Astronomica was read, commented upon, {{and edited}} {{by a number}} of scholars. Nevertheless, it failed to become <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> <b>as</b> other {{classical}} Latin poems and was neglected for centuries. This started to change during the early 20th century when, between 1903 and 1930, the classicist A. E. Housman published a critically acclaimed edition of the poem in five books. Housman's work was followed by the Latinist G. P. Goold's lauded English translation in 1977. Today, scholars consider the Astronomica to be highly technical, complicated, and occasionally contradictory; at the same time, many have praised Manilius's ability to translate complex mathematical computations into poetic verse.|$|E
5|$|Verdi was {{concerned}} about {{working on a new}} opera at his advanced age, but he yearned to write a comic work and was pleased with Boito's draft libretto. It took the collaborators three years from mid-1889 to complete. Although the prospect of a new opera from Verdi aroused immense interest in Italy and around the world, Falstaff did not prove to be <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> <b>as</b> earlier works in the composer's canon. After the initial performances in Italy, other European countries and the US, the work was neglected until the conductor Arturo Toscanini insisted on its revival at La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera in New York from the late 1890s into the next century. Some felt that the piece suffered from a lack of the full-blooded melodies of the best of Verdi's previous operas, a view strongly contradicted by Toscanini. Conductors of the generation after Toscanini to champion the work included Herbert von Karajan, Georg Solti and Leonard Bernstein. The work is now part of the regular operatic repertory.|$|E
