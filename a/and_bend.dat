In late February 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed <b>and</b> <b>bend</b> its trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet is Juno, which entered into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016. Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid ocean of its moon Europa.|$|E
5|$|The {{crucifix}} {{was installed}} in the church of Santa Croce {{at the end of}} the thirteenth century and remained there until 1966 when the banks of the Arno river burst and flooded Florence. Thousands of artworks were damaged or destroyed; the Crucifix lost 60% of its paint. It had suffered earlier flood damage in 1333 and 1557. In 1966 it was on display in the lower Museo dell' Opera, which is at a lower elevation and closer to the waterline than the Santa Croce church, where it was located during earlier floods. The water level reached the height of Christ's halo and took large tracts of paint when it retreated. The water deposited oil, mud and naphtha on the wood frame, which further swelled from soakage, forcing the panel to expand <b>and</b> <b>bend,</b> cracking the paint-work.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the details of}} a numerical study of a cold-formed steel beam known as LiteSteel Beam (LSB) subject to combined shear <b>and</b> <b>bending</b> actions. The LSB sections are produced by a patented manufacturing process involving simultaneous cold-forming and electric resistance welding. They have a unique shape of a channel beam with two rectangular hollow flanges. To date, however, no investigation has been conducted into the strength of LSB sections under combined shear <b>and</b> <b>bending</b> actions. Hence a numerical study was undertaken to investigate the behaviour and strength of LSBs subject to combined shear <b>and</b> <b>bending</b> actions. In this research, finite element models of LSBs were developed to simulate the combined shear <b>and</b> <b>bending</b> behaviour <b>and</b> strength of LSBs. They were then validated by comparing their results with test results and used in a parametric study. Both experimental and finite element analysis results showed that the current design equations are not suitable for combined shear <b>and</b> <b>bending</b> capacities of LSBs. Hence improved design equations are proposed for the capacities of LSBs subject to combined shear <b>and</b> <b>bending</b> actions...|$|R

25|$|The {{round bow}} of Murtaja was modeled after Eisbrecher I, a German {{icebreaker}} designed by engineer Ferdinand Steinhaus from Hamburg and built in 1871, even though Robert Runeberg, an experienced Finnish naval architect {{and son of}} the national poet of Finland, had recommended a sharper ice-cutting bow instead of the spoon-shaped one. The angle of the stem, {{the first part of}} the icebreaker to encounter ice <b>and</b> <b>bend</b> it under the weight of the ship, was 33 degrees. The hull was extremely strong for its size and the shell plating thickness at the ice belt, , was twice as thick as in the strongest winter ships at that time.|$|E
25|$|Most optical {{phenomena}} can {{be accounted}} for using the classical electromagnetic description of light. Complete electromagnetic descriptions of light are, however, often difficult to apply in practice. Practical optics is usually done using simplified models. The most common of these, geometric optics, treats light {{as a collection of}} rays that travel in straight lines <b>and</b> <b>bend</b> when they pass through or reflect from surfaces. Physical optics is a more comprehensive model of light, which includes wave effects such as diffraction and interference that cannot {{be accounted for}} in geometric optics. Historically, the ray-based model of light was developed first, followed by the wave model of light. Progress in electromagnetic theory in the 19th century led to the discovery that light waves were in fact electromagnetic radiation.|$|E

On June 3,at the Derby meeting, Robert the Devil met Bend Or {{for the fifth time}} in the Epsom Gold Gup, over the Derby distance of one and a half miles. The Derby winner was in good form, having produced an impressive weight-carrying performance to win the City and Suburban Handicap in April. With other intended runners dropping out the race became a match, attracting extraordinary interest and provoking unprecedented scenes of excitement. Robert the Devil set off in front, and Archer followed close behind on Bend Or. Approaching the final furlong, Archer made his move, sending Bend Or into the lead. On this occasion, Robert the Devil could not respond <b>and</b> <b>Bend</b> Or appeared to have won rather more easily than the neck margin suggested.|$|E

25|$|Shaw and Edwards (aged 18 and 17, respectively, at {{the time}} Alpha started) were skilled amateur magicians who managed to fool the {{researchers}} with fairly simple tricks during the first stages of investigations. The project had originally started with spoon bending, so the two quickly developed a way to accomplish this. Contrary {{to one of the}} caveats Randi noted in his letter, the test setup included not one, but many and all sorts of spoons on the table, labeled with paper on a loop of string instead of some permanent marking. When starting to bend a spoon, they would actually pick up two or more and remove the labels, which they were allowed to do, because they claimed they were in the way. They would then simply switch the labels when putting them back and wait. The spoons were measured before and after the experiment, and since all sorts of spoons were used, simply switching the labels would produce different measurements, causing the scientist to believe that something paranormal had occurred. In other cases, they would drop one of the spoons in their lap <b>and</b> <b>bend</b> it below the table with one hand, while pretending to bend a spoon in their other hand, distracting the scientists.|$|E
25|$|He {{ordered his}} troopers to {{dismount}} and deploy in a skirmish line, according to standard army doctrine. In this formation, every fourth trooper held the horses for the troopers in firing position, with {{five to ten}} yards separating each trooper, officers to their rear and troopers with horses behind the officers. This formation reduced Reno's firepower by 25 percent. As Reno's men fired into the village and killed, by some accounts, several wives and children of the Sioux leader, Chief Gall (in Lakota, Phizí), mounted warriors began streaming out to meet the attack. With Reno's men anchored on their right by the impassable tree line <b>and</b> <b>bend</b> in the river, the Indians rode hard against the exposed left end of Reno's line. After about 20 minutes of long-distance firing, Reno had taken only one casualty, but the odds against him had risen (Reno estimated five to one) and Custer had not reinforced him. Trooper Billy Jackson reported that by then, the Indians had begun massing in the open area shielded by a small hill {{to the left of}} Reno's line and {{to the right of the}} Indian village. From this position the Indians mounted an attack of more than 500 warriors against the left and rear of Reno's line, turning Reno's exposed left flank. They forced a hasty withdrawal into the timber along the bend in the river. Here the Indians pinned Reno and his men down and set fire to the brush to try to drive the soldiers out of their position.|$|E
