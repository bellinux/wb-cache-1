He started studying Geology at the University of Sulaimani, and later Salahaddin University in Arbil (Kurdish, Hawler:هەولێر), the current capital of Iraq's Kurdistan Region.

50|$|Silvington was let {{during the}} time of Abbot <b>Azmar</b> or Azenarius (1100-1119) to a cleric named Aluric under an unusual lease. Aluric paid 40 shillings as a lump sum for the entire lease, with no annual rent. His wife, Edith, and their {{children}} were to render homage to St. Rémy sicut liberi homines, as free people, not villeins. The abbey apparently took for granted that a cleric would be married. If Alured were to die first, Edith would pay the monks 20 shillings: if he survived his wife, he would have to surrender a third of the goods on his vill on her death. By the mid-13th century Silvington was {{in the hands of the}} Beysyns, a wealthy landowning family. As he was a tenant-in-chief an inquisition post mortem was held on Adam de Beysin, under a writ dated 4 May 1261. This showed that, among his minor estates, he was paying 24 shillings annually to St. Rémy for Silvington. A further inquisition in 1263, on the succession of his son Robert, shows that he also held the Edgeland estate, part of Lapley manor, for four shillings. In 1338, after the agrarian crisis and famine, an inquisition showed that Thomas de Beysyn had been rendering a service of only half a mark for Silvington, although he was enjoying revenues totalling five marks from his own tenants on the manor. A fine of lands of 1347 shows that by that time it had passed into the hands of Richard and Agnes Haukiston.|$|E

The monthly averaged wind speed at a height of 5 m above ground level was found to range from 4. 65 to 11. 86 (m/s) and after extrapolation at 50 m found to be from 6. 41 to 16. 36 (m/s). The monthly Weibull distributions parameters (c and k) were found to vary between 5. 21 and 13. 46 (m/s) and 1. 60 to 3. 47 respectively, with average power density ranging from 70. 89 to 1559. 16 (W/m 2) at 5...|$|E
