He {{grew up in the}} affluent Chicago suburb of Lake Forest and attended Lake Forest Academy, Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, and Princeton University. All four boys, James, Stever, David, and George, went to Lake Forest Academy, Exeter and Princeton; his brother Stever became a successful <b>advertising</b> <b>man</b> at J. Walter Thompson before heading the F. William Free agency. While at Princeton all four brothers were members of the Tiger Inn eating club. [...] "My father insisted on accomplishment," [...] Aubrey recalled in 1986. In college, Aubrey was a star on the football team, playing left end. He graduated in 1941 with honors in English and entered the United States Army Air Forces. During his service in World War II, Aubrey rose to the rank of major and taught military flying to actor James Stewart, who was a licensed civilian pilot.|$|E

2500|$|His book Ogilvy on Advertising is {{a general}} {{commentary}} on advertising and not all the ads shown in the book are his. In early 2004, Adweek magazine asked {{people in the business}} [...] "Which individuals - alive or dead - made you consider pursuing a career in advertising?", and Ogilvy topped the list. The same result came when students of advertising were surveyed. His best-selling book Confessions of an <b>Advertising</b> <b>Man</b> (...) {{is one of the most}} popular and famous books on advertising. Based on this book, there is a strong suspicion that Ogilvy is the inspiration for Don Draper in the popular series Mad Men.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{worked as}} a chef, researcher, and farmer, Ogilvy now started his own {{advertising}} agency {{with the backing of}} Mather and Crowther, the London agency being run by his elder brother, Francis, which later acquired another London agency, S.H. Benson. The new agency in New York was called Ogilvy, Benson, and Mather. David Ogilvy had just $6,000 ($59,726.72 in 2016 dollars) in his account when he started the agency. He writes in Confessions of an <b>Advertising</b> <b>Man</b> that, initially, he struggled to get clients. Ogilvy also admitted (referring to the pioneer of British advertising Bobby Bevan, the chairman of Benson): [...] "I was in awe of him but Bevan never took notice of me!" [...] They would meet later, however.|$|E

50|$|Some {{television}} monitoring {{studies found}} that in <b>advertising,</b> <b>men</b> are portrayed {{with at least two}} occupations, and they usually seem very active and logical. Also, when a man is promoting on an advertisement, they usually do not use the product, they just talk about it. They usually seem to be the beneficiary of the product or service, which is performed by girls. In <b>advertising,</b> <b>men</b> usually promote alcoholic beverages, banking services, credit cards, or cars. Although women also promote cars, advertisements involving women are usually highly dependent on their sexuality, which is not the case for those with men, who are shown in these ads in an elegant and powerful way. Also, when men are acting on a television commercial, they are usually performing activities such as playing sports, driving around girls, repairing cars, drinking, relaxing, and having fun.|$|R

50|$|Advertising {{does not}} {{represent}} men and women the same way. Men are frequently presented as the central figure in the ads, and women are just accompanying them. Men are usually portrayed with more authority and proficiency than women. The results of research about this were that in advertising over 85% of voiceovers were <b>men.</b> In <b>advertising,</b> usually the <b>man</b> acts and the woman appears. For example: On television commercials of condoms, when {{a man and woman}} are together, the woman usually just laughs and stays quietly beside the man, while he talks and acts as the central figure. In other ads of condoms when the women talk, they are only talking about how great the guy was, and how happy they feel after being with him. In <b>advertising,</b> <b>men</b> and women don't receive the same value.|$|R

In actuality, St. Laurent was uncomfortable away from Ottawa, was subject to fits of depression (especially after 1953), and on political trips was carefully managed by <b>advertising</b> <b>men</b> from the firm of Cockfield Brown. St. Laurent led the Liberals to an overwhelming triumph in the 1949 election, campaigning under the slogan [...] "You never had it so good".
