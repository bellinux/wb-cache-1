It was a thought experiment that took {{on a life of}} its own." [...] Miller continued that at the time, he and Stentz thought they were writing Olivia-focused episodes, but [...] "In retrospect, we really wrote a four-part story about Walter, his relationship to children, and the struggle between Walter-who-was and Walter-who-is. If you look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> his decision at the end of 'Northwest Passage' becomes the moment where he reconciles those things. He doesn't resolve them, but he comes to grips with them. Once again in retrospect, I think that's what the supermarket breakdown was really about. This happens — you think a scene is about one thing when you're in the middle of it, and realize it's something else entirely when you look back. Characters can be sneaky motherfuckers that way." ...|$|E
500|$|Eight years {{previous}} to the Once Upon a Time pilot (the two {{had just}} completed their work on Felicity, in 2002), Kitsis and Horowitz became inspired to write fairytales out of a love of [...] "mystery and excitement of exploring lots of different worlds." [...] They presented the premise to networks, but were refused because of its fantastical nature. The two learned from their time on Lost {{to look at the}} story in a different way, that [...] "character has to trump mythology"; they expanded, [...] "as people, you've got to see what the void in their heart or in their lives is to care about them... For us, this was as much about the character journeys and seeing what was ripped from them in coming to Storybrooke– going <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> as opposed to making it the 'break-the-curse show.'" [...] Despite the comparisons and similarities to Lost, the writers intend them to be very different shows. To them, Lost concerned itself with redemption, while Once Upon a Time is about [...] "hope". Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof aided {{in the development of the}} series as a consultant, but had no official credit for the pilot.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2008, NFL draft expert Mel Kiper Jr. named Ringer as {{the best}} back {{in the class of}} 2009. However, when Mel Kiper revised his 2009 draft choices in February 2009, Ringer was not listed among Kiper's top five running backs. It was {{revealed}} Ringer has been playing on a torn lateral meniscus, which he had surgery on six days after the season ended. Ringer has said he has worked out at the combine with his knee at [...] "80%". Ringer skipped the 2009 Senior Bowl because of his injury. Despite the injury, Ringer chose to participate in the 40-yard dash at the NFL combine. He clocked in at 4.59. Ringer was quoted as saying [...] "I personally was disappointed because I know I'm a lot faster than that. But I was able to do that just coming off knee surgery, so if I look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> I'm happy." [...] He finished third among running backs in the 20-yard shuttle (4.11 seconds) and fifth in the three-cone drill (6.87 seconds). During the combine, Ringer said he interviewed with 12 teams. ESPN.com ranked him as the 8th best running back in the draft. When Scouts Inc. graded Ringer, they gave him a 1 (Exceptional) in Character. They said of Ringer, [...] "No off-the-field issues we are aware of. Coaches and teammates have only positive things to say about him. Outstanding intangibles." [...] Ringer was a projected 3rd Round pick. Another site lists him as a mid-second round draft choice. Ringer has drawn comparisons to NFL players Mike Hart and Chester Taylor. His strengths are listed as build, toughness, and patience, while his weaknesses are listed as height, breakaway speed, open field elusiveness, and injuries. A Dayton Daily News article states that Ringer is [...] "Still projected as a 2nd-rounder", despite the injury. The same article states that Ringer interviewed with the Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals at the NFL combine.|$|E

6000|$|Whitwell {{gave himself}} time for reflection. [...] "No, sir, I don't look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> I guess the wires got crossed some way.

60|$|Evidence of my {{literary}} success, if {{you look}} <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> may have lain in an invitation to dine at Andrew Carnegie's, but a suspicion that I was being patronized made me hesitate.

I had never met him and was not eager for his recognition.|$|E

So, if he kills you he is doing you a service; if you kill him, you have greatly obliged him. So, looking <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> <b>it</b> does not much matter which way it goes; for if you do him this service one day, someone else may do you a like good turn the next." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I wonder Mr. Rushbrook don't look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> <b>It</b> is a {{shame that}} all these pretty things--and you know they are really good and valuable--shouldn't show what they are.

6000|$|The reader may {{interrupt}} at {{this point}} to declare that all life, even the life of the city is futile, {{if you look at it}} in that way, and I reply by saying that I still have moments when I look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> What is it all about, anyhow, this life of ours? Certainly to be forever weary and worried, to be endlessly soiled with thankless labor and to grow old before one's time soured and disappointed, is not the whole destiny of man! ...|$|E

Nobody, you see, can put a big thing through by working it all out logically beforehand. It appears all {{difficulties}} if you look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> One has to take his chances with the faith that attempts the impossible and the fire that carries him through an obstacle before he realizes that it is one.

6000|$|My mother, {{like most}} of her neighbors, still cooked and served meals in our one living room during the winter but moved into a [...] "summer kitchen" [...] in April.

Mother at once got down the rag carpet and gave orders for us to shake out and bring in some clean straw to put under it, and when we had tacked it down and re-arranged the furniture, it was no longer a place for muddy boots and shirt-sleeved shiftlessness, it had an air of being in perpetual Sabbath leisure.|$|E

So I was much surprised to find that when Uncle came in he didn't look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> at all. He looked at the box of badges and buttons and things, and he said at once, [...] "Ha! Orders of Distinction! An excellent idea." [...] He picked up a silly little white button with the motto [...] "Welcome to New York," [...] and he said [...] "Admirable! That shall be the first class." [...] And there was a little lead spoon with [...] "Souvenir of the Bowery" [...] that he made the second class. He started arranging and rearranging all the things in the box, just as he used to arrange the orders and decorations at the Palace. Only those were REAL things such as the Order of the Red Feather, and The Insignia of the Black Duck, and these were only poor tin baubles. But I could see that Uncle no longer knows the difference, and as his fingers fumbled among these silly things he was quite trembling and eager to begin, like a child waiting for to-morrow.|$|E
