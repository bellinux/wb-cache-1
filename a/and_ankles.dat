5|$|Non-disabled sprinters have calves <b>and</b> <b>ankles</b> that {{return and}} amplify the energy {{supplied}} by their hips and knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work {{because he does}} not have calves <b>and</b> <b>ankles</b> with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.|$|E
5|$|While bubbles {{can form}} {{anywhere}} in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, <b>and</b> <b>ankles.</b> Joint pain ("the bends") accounts for about 60% to 70% of all altitude DCS cases, with the shoulder being the most common site. Neurological symptoms are present in 10% to 15% of DCS cases with headache and visual disturbances being the most common symptom. Skin manifestations are present in about 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS ("the chokes") is very rare in divers and has been observed much less frequently in aviators since the introduction of oxygen pre-breathing protocols. The table below shows symptoms for different DCS types.|$|E

While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, <b>and</b> <b>ankles.</b> Joint pain occurs in about 90% of DCS cases reported to the U.S. Navy, with neurological symptoms and skin manifestations each present in 10% to 15% of cases.

25|$|This {{position}} has the subject bound in a horizontal position, sometimes face up but usually face down. The body is lifted into this position either by attaching bondage {{equipment to the}} wrists <b>and</b> <b>ankles,</b> or {{to other areas of}} the body, or a mixture of both, with the subject's weight born by these areas. The ankles or wrists may be brought together or kept apart by a spreader bar. In case of the wrists <b>and</b> <b>ankles</b> ropes or suspension cuffs can be used. When the body itself is used to suspend the person, they may first be tied into a conventional bondage position such as a hogtie or ball tie, then by attaching ropes or chains to ropes under areas of the body able to take weight the person is lifted into the air.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the foot <b>and</b> <b>ankle</b> {{condition}} between elite ath-letes and non-athletes. [Subjects] The elite athletes group included 85 subjects (28 males and 57 females) and the non-athletes group included 85 subjects (38 males and 47 females). [Methods] All subjects were evaluated for pain (visual analogue scale, VAS) <b>and</b> foot <b>and</b> <b>ankle</b> condition (The Foot <b>and</b> <b>Ankle</b> Disability Index, FADI, and The Foot <b>and</b> <b>Ankle</b> Outcome Score, FAOS). [Results] The elite athlete group showed significant differences from the non-athletes group in VAS, FADI (FADI, FADI-Sports), and FAOS (FAOS-symptoms, FAOS-pain, FAOS-ADL, FAOS-sports, FAOS-QoL). In addition, a meaningful difference in VAS, FADI-Sports, and FAOS-symptoms was observed between gymnasts and wrestlers. [Conclusion] The results of this study suggest the necessity prevention of injury to the foot <b>and</b> <b>ankle</b> of elite athletes, and for the development of exercise for the rehabilitation of foot <b>and</b> <b>ankle</b> injuries, because there is a difference in foot <b>and</b> <b>ankle</b> condition between elite athletes and non-athletes...|$|R

5000|$|Foot <b>and</b> <b>ankle</b> {{surgeons}} {{are trained}} to treat all disorders of the foot <b>and</b> <b>ankle,</b> both surgical <b>and</b> non-surgical. Additionally, the surgeons are also trained to understand the complex connections between disorders and deformities of the foot, <b>ankle,</b> knee, hip, <b>and</b> the spine. Therefore, the surgeon will typically see cases that vary from trauma (such as malleolar fractures, tibial pilon fractures, calcaneus fractures, navicular and midfoot injuries and metatarsal and phalangeal fractures.) Arthritis care (primarily surgical) of the <b>ankle</b> joint <b>and</b> the joints of the hindfoot (tarsals), midfoot (metatarsals) and forefoot (phalanges) also plays a rather significant role. Congentital and acquired deformalities include adult acquired flatfoot, non-neuromuscular foot deformity, diabetic foot disorders, hallux valgus and several common pediatric foot <b>and</b> <b>ankle</b> conditions (such as clubfoot, flat feet, tarsal coalitions, etc.) Patients may also be referred to a foot <b>and</b> <b>ankle</b> surgeon for proper {{diagnosis and treatment of}} heel pain (such as a consequence from plantar heel fasciitis), nerve disorders (such as tarsal tunnel syndrome) and tumors of the foot <b>and</b> <b>ankle.</b> Amputation <b>and</b> <b>ankle</b> arthroscopy (the use of a laparoscope in foot <b>and</b> <b>ankle</b> surgical procedures) have emerged as prominent tools in foot <b>and</b> <b>ankle</b> care.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} compensatory biomechanical patterns in the lower extremity created by restricted knee flexion <b>and</b> <b>ankle</b> dorsiflexion when performing squats. Forty two healthy subjects (21 men, 21 women; 22. 5 (4. 5) years, 73. 8 (17. 8) kg, 167. 5 (12. 5) cm) participated in the study.
