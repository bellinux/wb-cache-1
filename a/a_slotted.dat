5|$|VSWR and the {{positions}} of the nodes are parameters that can be directly measured with an instrument called <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> line. This instrument makes use of the reflection phenomenon to make many different measurements at microwave frequencies. One use is that VSWR and node position can be used to calculate the impedance of a test component terminating the slotted line. This is a useful method because measuring impedances by directly measuring voltages and currents is difficult at these frequencies.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>slotted</b> Aloha {{wireless}} network employs the Aloha MAC protocol where the channels access the medium, independently at each time interval, with some probability p.

25|$|Guests board an Enhanced Motion Vehicle (EMV) {{intended}} {{to appear as}} a battered military troop transport. EMVs ride on neoprene filled tires (for operational precision) driven by hydraulic rotors that provide forward motion, hydraulic pressure is applied on-board each vehicle at 3,000 psi using DC pressurizers. The vehicle has four wheel steering atop the surface of <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> roadbed. The track has only three switches: a left/right split switch just before loading/unloading, a left/right combine switch just after safety check station/dispatch and a compound switch to swap vehicles in/out of the maintenance bay, behind the mirrors. Beneath the slot a tubular guideway guides the front wheelset and a damper for the rear wheelset, and three electrical buss bars provide the EMV 480 volts AC. The power is divided among the two motion systems, control, safety and audio systems. Each transport can accommodate twelve guests with three rows of seats, four across, with the front left seat behind a non-operational steering wheel.|$|E
25|$|Straight away Munroe {{obtained}} a few lumps of black graphite which he beat to a pulp with a hammer. He separated the fine particles that floated {{to the top}} of the water with a spoon and mixed them with a clay solution. His first experiments with this lead solution was not very successful. He continued making cabinet maker’s squares and sold the few of these which he could. In this time he continued experimenting with graphite lead for pencils with little accomplishment. He had no knowledge of the subject and feared consulting others as they might take the idea and produce pencils themselves. Munroe continued experimenting in secret with graphite powder formulas on his own. Eventually he figured a way to come up with a suitable graphite paste formula of various ingredients that could be poured into <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> line made in some cedar wood blanks. The pencil centers would be his secret formula of a mixture of dried graphite paste of clay and other unknown ingredients. They were air dried and not hardened by firing in a furnace as Europeans did, so the quality was not as good as theirs—but it was fine enough to write with.|$|E
500|$|Standing wave ratio (SWR or VSWR) {{is a basic}} {{parameter}} and the one most commonly measured on <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> line. [...] This quantity is of particular importance for transmitter antennae. [...] A high SWR indicates a poor match between the feed line and the antenna, which increases wasted power, can cause damage to components in the transmission path, possibly including the transmitter, and cause distortion to TV, FM stereo and digital signals. [...] With the input power set so that the maxima are at 0 dBm, a measurement of a minimum in decibels will directly give SWR (after discarding the minus sign).|$|E

500|$|Measurements of {{microwave}} {{power can be}} made directly, usually with a thermistor based detector and meter. [...] However, these instruments are expensive and a common meter used in measurements with <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> line is instead a cheaper low-frequency VSWR meter. [...] The {{microwave power}} source is amplitude modulated with, typically, a [...] signal which is recovered by the envelope detector in the probe {{and sent to the}} VSWR meter. [...] This scheme is preferred to simply detecting the unmodulated carrier directly, which would result in a DC output, because a stable, narrowband, tuned amplifier can be used to amplify the [...] signal. [...] A large amplification is required in the VSWR meter because the limit of the square law range of the detector diode is no more than [...]|$|E
500|$|... where VSWR is the {{standing}} wave ratio expressed as a voltage ratio (not in decibels). [...] However, to completely characterise the reflection coefficient, the phase of ρ must also be found. [...] This is done on <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> line by measuring {{the distance of the}} first minimum from the DUT. [...] Moving the probe right up to the DUT is not practicable so a different approach is usually adopted. [...] The position of the first minimum when the reference short is in place is noted. [...] The distance back along the line from this reference point to the next minimum when the DUT is in place will be the same as the distance from the DUT to the first minimum. [...] This is so because the reference short guarantees a minimum at the DUT position.|$|E
500|$|Slotted lines {{can measure}} {{standing}} waves, wavelength, and, with some calculation or plotting on Smith charts, {{a number of}} other parameters including reflection coefficient and electrical impedance. [...] A precision variable attenuator is often incorporated in the test setup to improve accuracy. [...] This is used to make level measurements, while the detector and VSWR meter are retained only to mark a reference point for the attenuator to be set to, thus eliminating entirely the detector and meter measurement errors. [...] The parameter most commonly measured by <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> line is SWR. This serves as a measure of the accuracy of the impedance match to the item under test. [...] This is especially important for transmitting antennas and their feed lines; high standing wave ratio on a radio or TV antenna can distort the signal, increase transmission line loss and potentially damage components in the transmission path, possibly even the transmitter.|$|E

As well as the folding nose radome to allow for storage in the smaller hangars of the British ships, {{it had to have}} a significantly strengthened undercarriage to account for the higher landing weight (British policy was to bring back unused ordnance). It had a telescopic nosewheel oleo that extended by [...] to provide an increased take-off attitude (the extension of the nosewheel put the Phantom at a 9° attitude) due to the shorter and less powerful catapults.
