5|$|A {{short time}} later Brock {{received}} a report from Fort George {{that some of the}} garrison were planning to imprison the officers and flee to the U.S. Immediately he boarded the schooner that had brought the message and proceeded to Fort George, under the command of then-Lieutenant-Colonel Roger Hale Sheaffe. <b>A</b> <b>hastily</b> assembled honour guard formed to greet Brock's unexpected arrival. Alone on entering the fort, Brock ordered the sergeant of the guard to disarm and had him confined.|$|E
5|$|Before the game, England {{were heavy}} {{favorites}} against <b>a</b> <b>hastily</b> assembled U.S. team, which {{was composed of}} part-time players. The game's only goal was scored by the U.S.'s Haitian-born center forward Joe Gaetjens. This game and the U.S. team were profiled by author Geoffrey Douglas in his book The Game of Their Lives, which {{was made into a}} film of the same name (later renamed The Miracle Match).|$|E
5|$|Held up by {{freezing}} {{weather and}} snow storms, LI Corps was approaching Zagreb from the north, and broke through <b>a</b> <b>hastily</b> established defensive line between Pregrada and Krapina. Bicycle-mounted {{troops of the}} 183rd Infantry Division turned east to secure Ustaše-controlled Varaždin. The German-installed NDH government called on all Croats to stop fighting, and in the evening, LI Infantry Corps entered Zagreb and relieved the 14th Panzer Division.|$|E

5|$|The 6th Division's next {{campaign}} was the failed Battle of Greece, {{a disaster for}} the British Commonwealth forces sent there. While in Greece, Mackay led <b>a</b> <b>hastily</b> assembled Australian-British-New Zealand-Greek formation known as Mackay Force, defending the Klidi Pass at the Battle of Vevi. The Allies were forced to retreat in a fierce assault by the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler brigade. Mackay was the only Australian general to face the Waffen-SS in battle.|$|E
5|$|The Patagonian {{tensions}} heightened in 1872 and 1878, when Chilean warships seized merchant {{ships which}} had been licensed {{to operate in the}} disputed area by the Argentine government. An Argentine warship did the same to a Chilean-licensed American ship in 1877. This action nearly led to war in November 1878, when the Argentines dispatched a squadron of warships to the Santa Cruz River. The Chilean Navy responded in kind, and war was only avoided by <b>a</b> <b>hastily</b> signed treaty.|$|E
5|$|The nearby city of Heidelberg, {{further south}} of the Main on the Neckar River, {{appeared}} to be the next French target. Lieutenant Field Marshal Peter Quasdanovich, who had remained in the region between Mannheim and Heidelberg, used <b>a</b> <b>hastily</b> enhanced abatis to establish a defensive line at the sleepy country village of Handschuhsheim, east of the city of Heidelberg. The French force of two divisions—about 12,000 men—outnumbered the 8,000 defenders, and the position seemed untenable.|$|E

5|$|Association {{football}} {{was first introduced}} to Croatia by English expatriates working on industrial projects in Rijeka and Županja in 1873. By 1907, local clubs had been established in Croatia and a modern edition of the sport's laws was translated and published. Before the nation's independence, Croatian footballers played for the national teams of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1919–39) and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1945–90), though during periods of political upheaval, ethnically Croatian sides occasionally formed to play unofficial matches. <b>A</b> <b>hastily</b> arranged Croatian side, managed by Hugo Kinert, played a few matches in 1918–19.|$|E
5|$|By 13 October 1941, the Wehrmacht {{had reached}} the Mozhaisk defense line, <b>a</b> <b>hastily</b> {{constructed}} double set of fortifications protecting Moscow's western approaches which extended from Kalinin towards Volokolamsk and Kaluga. Despite recent reinforcements, only around 90,000 Soviet soldiers manned this line–far too few to stem the German advance. Given the limited resources available, Zhukov decided to concentrate his forces at four critical points: the 16th Army under Lieutenant General Rokossovsky guarded Volokolamsk, Mozhaisk was defended by 5th Army under Major General Govorov, the 43rd Army of Major General Golubev defended Maloyaroslavets, and the 49th Army under Lieutenant General Zakharkin protected Kaluga. The entire Soviet Western Front—nearly destroyed after its encirclement near Vyazma—was being recreated almost from scratch.|$|E
5|$|Given Huskisson's importance, and the {{potential}} impact {{on the future of}} Liverpool and Manchester's industries and on the embryonic railway industry of any findings of liability {{on the part of the}} railway, a swift determination of the causes of the accident was considered essential. By 9.00am on the morning after the accident, <b>a</b> <b>hastily</b> convened coroner's jury was assembled in the Grapes public house in Eccles. The coroner himself, MrMilne, arrived at 10.00am and was in a hurry to proceed as he had another inquest scheduled that afternoon, but proceedings were unable to begin as Lord Wilton, the only sworn witness scheduled to attend the inquest, could not be found. In the meantime, Milne sent the jury to the vicarage to view Huskisson's body.|$|E

She threw about her shoulders an opera cloak, and with a light Venetian scarf half concealed the beauty of her hair and features. [...] "Abducted!" [...] she murmured, [...] "and by six of them! I think she said six. Oh, the horror of it!" [...] A touch of powder to her cheeks and a slight blackening of her eyebrows, and the courageous girl was ready.|$|R

5|$|Historical {{reaction}} to the battle {{has focused on the}} significantly stronger British position in the encounter, with three large regular warships pitted against <b>a</b> <b>hastily</b> converted merchant vessel with a significant proportion of the crew suffering from illness. Duguay-Trouin was also weakly built and weakly armed: early estimates that the Duguay Trouins main battery mounted twenty-six 18-pounder long guns were revised to 12-pounders with eight smaller cannon on the upper deck. The British blockade of Isle de France continued throughout the year, with Centurion engaged in an inconclusive action against a French squadron in October. Although Isle de France remained in French hands throughout the conflict, the Indian Ocean was largely under British control by 1796.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, the {{outbreak}} of World War I was greeted with considerable enthusiasm. Even before Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914, the nation pledged its support alongside other states of the British Empire and almost immediately began preparations to send forces overseas {{to participate in the}} conflict. The first campaign that Australians were involved in was in German New Guinea after <b>a</b> <b>hastily</b> raised force known as the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force was dispatched from Australia to seize German possessions in the Pacific in September 1914. At the same time another expeditionary force, initially consisting of 20,000 men and known as the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF), was raised for service overseas.|$|E
5|$|One of McCreary's first acts as {{governor}} was signing a bill appropriating $75,000 {{for the construction}} of a new governor's mansion. The legislature appointed a commission of five, including McCreary, to oversee the mansion's construction. The governor exercised a good deal of influence over the process, including the replacement of a conservatory with a ballroom in the construction plan and the selection of a contractor from his hometown of Richmond as assistant superintendent of construction. Changing societal trends also affected construction. <b>A</b> <b>hastily</b> constructed stable to house horse-drawn carriages was soon abandoned in favor of a garage for automobiles.|$|E

5|$|Production {{started in}} October 1953, {{but had to}} be halted within weeks when Masina dislocated her ankle during the convent scene with Quinn. With {{shooting}} suspended, De Laurentiis saw an opportunity to replace Masina, whom he had never wanted for the part and {{who had not yet}} been signed to a contract. This changed as soon as executives at Paramount viewed the rushes of the scene and lauded Masina's performance, resulting in De Laurentiis announcing that he had her on an exclusive and ordering her to sign <b>a</b> <b>hastily</b> prepared contract, at approximately a third of Quinn's salary.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes rejoined former club Grays Athletic, {{where he}} had played on loan in 2007, on 19 January 2010. He scored a goal on his debut in <b>a</b> <b>hastily</b> {{arranged}} friendly, after their league game with Kidderminster Harriers was postponed, {{later in the week}} during a 4–1 victory against Aveley. Rhodes' senior debut came {{at the end of the}} same week, when he was one of six new members of manager Julian Dicks' side, only for them to lose 4–0 to Rhodes' former team Oxford United. Rhodes was substituted by Harry Agombar during the second half. He was released at the end of the 2009–10 season, having made 15 appearances.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Tory Island, (also {{known as}} the Battle of Donegal, Battle of Lough Swilly and Warren's Action) was a naval action fought on 12 October 1798 off the north coast of Ireland. The battle contested an {{attempted}} French invasion of Donegal {{in support of the}} Irish Rebellion of 1798, with a French squadron under Jean-Baptiste-François Bompart facing <b>a</b> <b>hastily</b> assembled Royal Navy blockade squadron under Sir John Borlase Warren. Bompart's force had been dispatched from Brest the month before with orders to reinforce a French army under Jean Humbert which had landed two months earlier.|$|E

5|$|The trophy was {{presented}} to Milan captain Paolo Maldini in the Guest of Honour's box, as UEFA President Michel Platini favoured {{a return to the}} past tradition of the winning captain receiving the trophy among the fans. It had become customary in recent years to have the presentation on <b>a</b> <b>hastily</b> constructed podium in the centre of the pitch. This {{was the first time that}} the trophy {{was presented}} to a winning captain by a UEFA president who had actually played against him in the past; during Michel Platini's final seasons with Juventus, the then-teenager Paolo Maldini was making his professional début with Milan.|$|E
5|$|A public {{announcement}} of the new pieces was made on May 15, 1965, only to be met with a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources {{at a time of}} severe coin shortages, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before <b>a</b> <b>hastily</b> called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 pieces had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure {{that there would be no}} repetition, Congress inserted a provision in the Coinage Act of 1965 forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years. That act also removed silver from the dime and quarter, and reduced the silver content of the half dollar to 40%.|$|E
5|$|By 26 April, {{the complex}} at Obersalzberg was {{under attack by}} the Allies, so Göring was moved to his castle at Mauterndorf. In his last will and testament, Hitler {{expelled}} Göring from the party and formally rescinded the decree making him his successor. He then appointed Karl Dönitz, the Navy's commander-in-chief, {{as president of the}} Reich and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Hitler and his wife, Eva Braun, committed suicide on 30 April 1945, a few hours after <b>a</b> <b>hastily</b> arranged wedding. Göring was freed on 5 May by a passing Luftwaffe unit, and {{he made his way to}} the American lines in hopes of surrendering to them rather than to the Russians. He was taken into custody near Radstadt on 6 May by elements of the 36th Infantry Division of the United States Army. This move likely saved Göring's life; Bormann had ordered him executed if Berlin had fallen.|$|E
