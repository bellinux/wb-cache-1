50|$|A major {{advantage}} of <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missiles</b> for ground attack by aircraft is the standoff distance they provide: missiles can be launched {{from a distance}} without coming within range of the target's air defences. Most <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missiles</b> are fire-and-forget from a standoff distance, allowing the attacker to withdraw without approaching further after launch. Some missiles (typically cruise missiles or anti-ship missiles) have long enough range to be launched over the horizon, finding the target autonomously.|$|R
25|$|In 1982, it {{was agreed}} to reconfigure several of the under-order Iraqi Mirages F1s from a general combat {{configuration}} into a dedicated ground attack platform, adopting Thomson-CSF-built sophisticated electronic warfare equipment and a vastly-increased payload capacity, which included the newly developed AS-30 <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missile.</b> In this role, the Mirage F1 was used to replace Iraq's aging fleet of Hawker Hunters. In September 1985, an agreement was signed between Dassault and Iraq for the delivery of a further 24 aircraft.|$|E
25|$|On 27 September 2014, {{the first}} armed sortie {{took place over}} Iraq. A pair of Tornado GR4s left Cyprus armed with laser-guided bombs, {{supported}} by a Voyager aerial refueling tanker. Ultimately, the aircraft did not locate any targets requiring immediate air attack and so gathered intelligence for coalition forces instead. The Royal Air Force (RAF) conducted its first airstrike on 30 September 2014. A pair of Tornado GR4s engaged an ISIL heavy weapon position and an armed pickup truck using a laser-guided bomb and <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missile.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Gorgon V {{project was}} begun in 1950 {{to develop an}} <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missile</b> capable of {{dispersing}} chemical warfare agents over a combat area. Designing of the missile was contracted to the Glenn L. Martin Company, which used the company's earlier PTV-N-2 Gorgon IV ramjet test missile {{as a basis for}} the weapon's design. The Gorgon V was to be a long slender missile, with swept wings and conventional tail. The Gorgon IV's ramjet engine, slung beneath the missile's tail, was replaced in the Gorgon V with a X14A aerosol generator, developed by the Edo Aircraft Corporation.|$|E
50|$|SUV-P: this {{air-to-ground}} subsystem utilizes identical hardware of SUV-VEP air-to-air subsystem, {{but with}} a different processing requirement. This subsystem is mainly used for <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missiles</b> such as Kh-59, and acts as an interface between the system on board the aircraft and the designated targeting pods of the <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missiles</b> {{that can not be}} controlled directly by the onboard avionics. The primary subsystem of SUV-P system is SUO-30PK subsystem and A-737 satellite navigational subsystem.|$|R
50|$|There is some {{cross-over}} between <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missiles</b> and surface-to-surface missiles. For example, {{there was}} an air-launched version of the Tomahawk missile, superseded by the AGM-86 ALCM. Other missiles used in both roles include the Penguin and AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship <b>missiles.</b> Many <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missiles</b> can be used against both ships and land targets, although some must be modified to perform a different role; for example, the AGM-84E Standoff Land Attack Missile is a land-attack version of the Harpoon.|$|R

Pakistan, first started exploring the drone technology when it acquired Falco drones from Selex Galileo of Italy for $40 million in 2008. Since then Pakistan have been developing Falco in Pakistan Aeronautical Complex {{in collaboration with the}} Italian firm. Then, Burraq was developed which was based on the same Falco technology. By March 2015, Pakistan was able to test-fire Burraq armed with an <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missile</b> named Barq with pin-point precision. Burraq were used majorly during the Operation Zarb-e-Azb.|$|E
25|$|However the United Kingdom’s Royal Air Force has an {{enhancement}} programme {{that aims}} to integrate the MBDA Storm Shadow cruise missile, the MBDA Brimstone <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missile</b> and the Meteor Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile into its Eurofighter Typhoon force. This programme is known as Project Centurion and has set a target of December 2018 to seamlessly integrate the weapons and capability of the Panavia Tornado GR4 before the Tornados go out of service in 2019. In October 2016, BAE systems confirmed that {{the first phase of}} Project Centurion's package of enhancements had entered the operational evaluation stage. In April 2017, BAE Systems announced six successful firings by the Typhoon in 2016, including a simultaneous firing of two Meteor missiles. Training with Meteor is now due to take place with the UK Royal Air Force later in 2017.|$|E
25|$|Typical combat {{equipment}} includes stabilised roof-mounted sensors, onboard countermeasures {{and door}} guns; when {{being used in}} the anti-tank role, the Lynx is typically armed with BGM-71 TOW missiles; missiles such as the Sea Skua have been used in the maritime anti-surface role. Additional armaments that have been interchangeably used include rockets, 20mm cannons, torpedoes, and depth charges. Those Lynx built for export have typically outfitted with armaments and equipment customized for the end-user, such as the Mokopa <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missile</b> used on Algeria's Lynx fleet, eight of which can be carried; studies into equipping the AGM-114 Hellfire have been performed, air-to-air missiles could also reportedly be adopted if the capability is sought by operators. Equipped armaments can be managed and controlled inflight through the onboard stores management system. In order to counteract battlefield threats such as infrared-guided missiles, various defensive aid subsystems can be optionally installed, including warning receivers and countermeasures.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with other}} German rocket scientists, Dornberger was {{released}} {{and brought to}} the United States {{under the auspices of}} Operation Paperclip, and worked for the United States Air Force for three years, developing guided missiles. From 1950 to 1965 he worked for the Bell Aircraft Corporation where he worked on several projects, rising to the post of Vice-President. He {{played a major role in}} the creation of the North American X-15 aircraft and was a key consultant for the Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar project. He also had a role on the creation of ideas and projects, which, in the end, led to the creation of the Space Shuttle. Dornberger also developed Bell's ASM-A-2, the world's first guided nuclear <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missile</b> developed for the Strategic Air Command. During the 1950s he had some attrition with von Braun and was instrumental in recruiting several engineers out of the Huntsville's team for Air Force projects. The most remarkable of them was Krafft Ehricke, who later created the Centaur rocket stage and actively participated in several more Defense projects.|$|E
500|$|The Hunter {{featured}} a nose-mounted ranging radar, providing range input to the gyro gunsight for air-to-air gunnery only. Other equipment included pylon-mounted underwing external fuel tanks, a forward-facing gun camera, and large streamlined pods for collecting expended shell cases beneath the gun pack. These were nicknamed [...] "Sabrinas", after the buxom actress of the time. Several variants were fitted with tail-mounted brake parachutes. Typically, export Hunters were equipped to {{be compatible with}} additional types of missiles, such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile and the AGM-65 Maverick <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missile.</b>|$|E
500|$|The AGM-65 Maverick <b>air-to-surface</b> <b>missile</b> is a {{commonly}} used munition for the A-10, targeted via electro-optical (TV-guided) or infrared. The Maverick allows target engagement at much greater ranges than the cannon, and thus less risk from anti-aircraft systems. During Desert Storm, {{in the absence}} of dedicated forward-looking infrared (FLIR) cameras for night vision, the Maverick's infrared camera was used for night missions as a [...] "poor man's FLIR". Other weapons include cluster bombs and Hydra rocket pods. The A-10 is equipped to carry laser-guided bombs. [...] A-10s usually fly with an ALQ-131 ECM pod under one wing and two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles under the other wing for self-defense.|$|E
