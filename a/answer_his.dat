5|$|On the {{syndicated}} version's first season, two contestants correctly answered all 15 questions {{and won the}} top prize of $1,000,000: Kevin Smith on February 18, 2003, and Nancy Christy on May 8 of the same year. During the Million Dollar Tournament of Ten which aired in November 2009, Sam Murray, who had previously supplied correct responses for eleven questions, risked his winnings on a special $1,000,000 question; {{he was the only}} contestant to <b>answer</b> <b>his</b> question correctly.|$|E
5|$|Chakrapani {{decided to}} retain only the {{background}} of Gundamma's family from the original and rewrote the remaining script, taking inspiration from William Shakespeare comedy, The Taming of the Shrew. Chakrapani killed the character of Gundamma's cowardly husband because he felt that a husband who cannot <b>answer</b> <b>his</b> wife's questions is not eligible to be included. Kamalakara Kameswara Rao was chosen to direct the film. Chakrapani named the central character Gundamma in the remake {{after one of the}} characters in the original, despite a lack of nativity. Nagi Reddy's family members and the employees of the Vijaya Vauhini Studios used to ask him Gundamma Katha Entha varaku vachchindi? ("What is the progress in Gundamma's story?"), which prompted Nagi Reddy to title the film Gundamma Katha after considering various options.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} {{a shot of the}} outside view of The Confidante hotel and two flamingos. In the next scene, and {{in the context of the}} track, Lipa is lying on a bed, {{thinking}} of giving her ex a second chance, while her friends are by her side. As the song continues, the artist heads towards the phone to <b>answer</b> <b>his</b> call, but is stopped by one of her friends. Then, she keeps receiving advice from the women, but manages to escape to the hallway. There, they perform a choreography, and return to the room. In the next scenes, the women start a sleepover, brushing each other's hair and applying lipstick on each other. They change their outfits and head towards the pool, where they walk over the water.|$|E

5|$|While {{teaching}} at the Budich Institute, Maeser came across Die Mormonen, an anti-Mormon book, by Moritz Busch. He and Edward Schoenfield, Maeser's brother-in-law and fellow teacher, decided to investigate the beliefs and practices of the LDS Church. Maeser wrote letters to missionaries of the church; missionary William Budge volunteered to go to Maeser's home to teach him and <b>answer</b> <b>his</b> questions. Both Maeser and Schoenfield joined the LDS Church. Maeser was baptized by Franklin D. Richards and Budge on October 14, 1855, in the Elbe River. Maeser was baptized at night because the church was banned in Germany at that time. Maeser was the first Mormon baptized in Saxony. His wife, Anna, was baptized shortly after on October 19. The following Sunday, a new branch of the church was established in Dresden, and Maeser became the first president. He {{and his family were}} forced to leave Germany by the Dresden police in July 1856, and would eventually travel to Salt Lake City, where Latter-day Saints were gathering.|$|E
5|$|After the rescue, onlookers applaud Hancock for his {{handling}} of the bank robbery. The superhero becomes popular again, as Ray had predicted. He goes out to dinner with Ray and Mary, with whom he reveals his apparent immortality and his amnesia stemming from an incident some 80 years prior and Ray reveals that Mary isn't Aaron's mother, who died after giving birth. After Hancock tucks a drunken Ray in bed, Hancock approaches and kisses Mary. At first, she responds passionately, but then turns angry, throwing Hancock through a wall and into the street. Hancock departs, confused at having apparently found another like himself. The next morning, Hancock arrives back at the house to demand answers from Mary. She warns him to stay away from her and her family but agrees to meet Hancock at his home to <b>answer</b> <b>his</b> questions. When she arrives, Hancock discovers that Mary also has superpowers and is apparently immortal. He threatens to expose her unless she explains their origins so she tells him that they are the last two members of a race that have lived for 3,000 years with their powers. Mary claims that they are brother and sister, which Hancock dismisses, given the nature of the previous night's kiss. Hancock realizes that Mary is not being entirely truthful and he departs to tell Ray about her. Their interaction results in a battle between Hancock and Mary that takes them to downtown Los Angeles, causing significant damage to the area. Ray, downtown in a business meeting, sees and recognizes Mary using superhero powers similar to those of Hancock. Ray departs his meeting and arrives home {{just in time to see}} Mary land in the backyard, followed closely by Hancock. She then reveals that, although he doesn't remember it, Hancock is her husband. The three then quietly go their separate ways.|$|E
25|$|Determined to <b>answer</b> <b>his</b> critics, Berkeley, by now {{promoted}} to vice-admiral and leading the van at the Four Days' Battle, took his ship {{into the thick}} of the fighting, and was surrounded by Dutch ships. Cut off from support he fought fiercely, but his ship was overwhelmed and captured, with Berkeley being killed in the action. His body was taken to the Netherlands and embalmed, before being returned to England and interred in Westminster Abbey. Accusations of cowardice pursued him even after his death, but later biographies have been more sympathetic.|$|E

25|$|After his return, in January 2005 Habib {{filed suit}} against the Australian {{government}} for its cooperation with the United States, alleging that he was beaten and humiliated in Pakistan after his arrest. He also alleged that an Australian official was present {{at some of these}} interrogations, but the Australian Government denied this. Habib claims to have been suspended to a ceiling by his arms, standing atop a barrel drum, and that when he gave an <b>answer</b> <b>his</b> Pakistani interrogators didn't believe, they would jolt him with electricity until he fainted.|$|E
25|$|After {{appearing}} on The Real World, Winick {{and his former}} costar, Pam Ling, began to date. Winick proposed to her with a cartoon he made for the occasion, and which he presented to her while wearing a gorilla suit. The cartoon presented Ling with two choices to <b>answer</b> <b>his</b> proposal. After she accepted his proposal, he summoned three singing Elvises. Winick and Ling married in a civil ceremony on August 26, 2001. Writer Armistead Maupin spoke at their ceremony. As of 2008, they have two children, {{a son and a}} daughter, whom they work to keep out of the spotlight, preferring to omit photos of them from social media, and publications who interview the couple to omit their names.|$|E
25|$|The {{next game}} {{was a rather}} quieter affair, as Heath beat Ladywood Conservatives, who had progressed through the {{qualifying}} competition to {{the first round of}} the Birmingham Cup, by seven goals to nil without unduly exerting themselves. In the Alliance, the rearranged visit to Lincoln City produced a one-all draw, Heath's goal scored by Wheldon from a left-wing cross. When Devey appeared in front of the Football Association to <b>answer</b> <b>his</b> charge of misconduct, the Council found no cause for inquiry, expressed regret for wasting his time, and paid his expenses. This would come as little surprise to the Independent, who blamed Caesar Jenkyns for starting the trouble by injuring Bob Brown early in the game.|$|E

25|$|On April 29, 2001, Taylor was {{critically}} {{injured in}} a car accident in Atlanta, Georgia. The driver, her then boyfriend Chad Renegar, was attempting to <b>answer</b> <b>his</b> cell phone when he lost control of the car and smashed into a utility pole. Taylor was wearing her automatic shoulder belt at the time, and she was not thrown from the vehicle. However, she suffered severe internal injuries, including a collapsed lung and serious liver damage, and two steel rods had to be implanted in her back to hold her spine together. The accident left her unconscious and in a coma for six weeks and then bedridden for an additional month. She was treated at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta and had approximately 56 operations and substantial physical therapy.|$|E
25|$|Returning to his office, Marlowe {{receives}} {{a call from}} Kingsley who tells him that Crystal has called Kingsley's secretary, begging for $500. Kingsley gives the money to Marlowe to deliver. Marlowe is to wear a distinctive scarf so Crystal will recognise him, though she expects Kingsley. He gets to the rendezvous, a bar, where a Mexican boy enters to tell Marlowe that Crystal is waiting outside. Marlowe goes out, meets Crystal and insists that she <b>answer</b> <b>his</b> questions before receiving the money. Crystal agrees but only at a nearby apartment where she is staying. At the apartment, Marlowe who has recognised her as Mrs. Fallbrook, the woman he met in Lavery's house, accuses her of being the murderer of Lavery. She pulls a gun on him. As Marlowe {{is about to take}} the gun away, someone hits him from behind with a sap.|$|E
25|$|With {{his conduct}} called into question, Berkeley {{resolved}} to <b>answer</b> <b>his</b> critics by distinguishing {{himself in the}} 1666 campaign. He had by now been appointed vice-admiral of the blue and been given command of the van of the English fleet which sailed to engage the Dutch at the Four Days' Battle. Flying his flag in Swiftsure again, he led the van of the fleet {{on the first day}} of the battle, 1 June 1666. He outran his squadron, sailed into the midst of the Dutch fleet and was surrounded by enemy ships. After a fierce battle he was killed and Swiftsure captured. He was reported as having fought to the end, until when almost alone on the quarter-deck, he was hit by a musket-ball in the throat. He staggered into the captain's cabin and was found by the Dutch lying dead on the table.|$|E

25|$|From 1965 to 1973, {{very few}} {{men in the}} US were convicted of burning their draft cards. Some 25,000 others went unpunished. Before 1965, the act of burning a draft card was already {{prohibited}} by US statute—the registrant was required to carry the card at all times, and any destruction of it was thus against the law. Also, it was entirely possible {{for a young man}} to destroy his draft card and still <b>answer</b> <b>his</b> country's call to service by appearing at an induction center and serving in the military. And it was possible for a registrant to faithfully keep his card on his person but fail to appear when called. The draft card was not {{an essential part of the}} government's ability to draft men into the military. Thus draft-card burning was an act of war resistance more than it was draft resistance.|$|E
25|$|But {{his enemies}} were not merely those whose errors he had exposed and whose hostility he had {{excited by the}} {{violence}} of his language. The results of his method of historical criticism threatened the Catholic controversialists and the authenticity {{of many of the}} documents on which they relied. The Jesuits, who aspired to be the source of all scholarship and criticism, saw the writings and authority of Scaliger as a formidable barrier to their claims. Muret {{in the latter part of}} his life professed the strictest orthodoxy, Lipsius had been reconciled to the Church of Rome, Isaac Casaubon was supposed to be wavering, but Scaliger was known to be an irreconcilable Protestant. As long as his intellectual supremacy was unquestioned, the Protestants had the advantage in learning and scholarship. His enemies therefore aimed, if not to <b>answer</b> <b>his</b> criticisms or to disprove his statements, yet to attack him as a man and to destroy his reputation. This was no easy task, for his moral character was strong.|$|E
500|$|It {{was normal}} for Shaftesbury to {{occasionally}} disappear {{for a few}} days from time to time, so no one, other than his girlfriend was initially concerned with his disappearance.

I was sure that something bad had happened." ...|$|E

500|$|The three sculptors {{submitted}} design sketches in mid-February, and on [...] {{met with}} Woolley in New York City to make presentations {{of their work}} and <b>answer</b> <b>his</b> questions. [...] After discussions between Woolley and McAdoo, Weinman was notified on [...] that five of his sketches had been selected—for the dime and half dollar, and the reverse of the quarter. [...] The same day, Woolley wrote to MacNeil {{to tell him he}} would sculpt the quarter's obverse, and to Polasek to inform him of his lack of success. [...] Members of the Commission persuaded Woolley that so much should not be entrusted to a single artist, and MacNeil was allowed to design both sides of the quarter, subject to the sculptor producing a design satisfactory to Woolley.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{deals with}} the concept of realizing one's {{mortality}} and discovering that life is more precious because of it. [...] Learning that he is in fact not immortal as he once thought, Bender initially feels that living a life that is anything less than immortal is worthless. [...] He {{deals with the}} devastating news of his newfound mortality by trying to find the one person who he believes can <b>answer</b> <b>his</b> questions about the reason for his life and why he was allowed to [...] "be born" [...] only to die. [...] Though Bender cannot find the answers to his mortality, he ultimately ends up developing a new outlook on life, believing it to be more precious than it was before now that it is finite, and he resolves that life is worth living no matter how brief it is.|$|E
500|$|The first {{contestant}} {{to attempt}} to answer the million dollar question was Sam Murray, the tournament's eighth-seeded qualifier. On November 11, Murray was asked approximately how many people had lived on Earth in its history and correctly guessed 100 billion. Murray was still atop the leaderboard entering the November 20 finale as he remained the only contestant to even attempt to <b>answer</b> <b>his</b> or her question. The only person who could defeat him was top seed and $250,000 winner Jehan Shamsid-Deen, who was asked a question regarding the Blorenge, cited as [...] "a rare example of a word that rhymes with orange". Shamsid-Deen considered taking the risk, believing (correctly) that the name belonged to a mountain in Wales. However, she decided that the potential of losing $225,000 did not justify the risk and elected {{to walk away from}} the question, giving Murray the win and the million dollar prize.|$|E
