40|$|In this thesis, {{we address}} {{issues in the}} specification, simulation, and formal {{verification}} of systems that are characterzed by real-time constraints and a mix of protocol and data computation aspects. We propose a novel specification language and modeling methodology [...] HAAD (Hierarchical Annotated Action Diagrams). In HAAD, the interface behavior or a system is captured as a hierarchy of action diagrams. The internal behavior is modeled by an Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM). A leaf <b>action</b> <b>diagram</b> defines a behavior (a template) over a set of ports. Procedures and predicates are attached to actions in order to describe the functional aspects of the interface. We propose algorithms and methods for the automatic generation of simulation models and response verification scripts from HAAD specifications. These models perform "on-the-fly parsing" of actions received at their I/O ports, sequencing through state transitions based on {{the result of this}} parsing, detecting incorrect, or ill-formed interface operations (bus cycles), verifying that all timing constraints at the input of the model are met, and driving the model outputs with appropriate delays. We formalize the operational semantics of leaf action diagrams under linear timing constraints, based on the concepts of a block machine and causal block machine. We state the realizability of an <b>action</b> <b>diagram</b> in terms of the existence of a causal block machine derived from the <b>action</b> <b>diagram.</b> We examine the problem of the compatability of concurrent, communicating leaf action diagrams described by linear timing constraints and we show the inaccuracies of known methods that address this problem. We define the <b>action</b> <b>diagram</b> compatibility problem in terms of the compatibility of all the possible combinations of causal block machines derived form these action diagrams. We prove that such enumeration is not needed in answering the compatibility question. This leads to an exact and efficient compatibility verification procedure...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a software program}} that recognizes hand-drawn Course of Action diagrams. User input is through sketching, {{or a combination of}} sketching and speech. Course of Action symbols are recognized incrementally, and the informal sketching input is replaced with formal images of the symbols. The system uses the LADDER shape definition language to represent the geometric properties of shapes, and is capable of recognizing 327 distinct Course of Action symbols. The Intermediate Feature Recognizer is used to recognize shapes of intermediate complexity and is capable of recognizing some shapes that cannot be described using LADDER definions. By detecting features of intermediate complexity, the system is capable of automatic error correction of some stroke segmentation errors and dealing with filled-in and multi-segment lines. The system is also able to recognize a combination of speech and sketching input of some information that can't easily be communicated through sketching alone. The system has a shape grammar to allow the sketch recognizer to conform to rules for creating Course of Action symbols.

40|$|Abstract. Diagrams are an {{effective}} means of conveying concrete, abstract or symbolic information about systems. Here, individuals or pairs of participants produced assembly instructions after assembling an object. When working individually, nearly all participants used a combination of text and diagrams. Those high in spatial ability produced the step-by-step <b>action</b> <b>diagrams</b> that in later studies were rated higher by all and improved performance of low ability participants. In a second experiment, pairs of participants assembled the object and produced instructions jointly. Pairs assembled the object faster and more accurately than individuals. Surprisingly, in the instructions produced, fewer than half the dyads used diagrams, and dyads produced fewer of the more effective diagrams. We speculate that the social verbal nature of the interactions of pairs encouraged verbal instructions. ...|$|R

Linear elastic behaviour of both the impacting object and the responding beam/plate has been assumed. Thus, it is most suited to the vulnerability assessment of brittle elements such as annealed or toughened glass panels. Analysis of this form can also be used for assessing the potential performance of reinforced concrete or masonry panels which possess very limited ductility. The introduced analytical tools can be implemented on charts (<b>action</b> <b>diagrams)</b> and spreadsheets for facilitating their applications in practice.

40|$|Sketching is {{a natural}} and {{intuitive}} form of human interaction that is employed {{in a variety of}} areas, such as engineering drawings or classroom teaching. Real time recognition of hand drawn sketches is a challenging problem due to the variability in hand drawing, as well as the variability in the drawing order. We propose an auto-completion system that is capable of classifying a partially drawn sketch if there is sufficient information to identify it as a domain object, thus increase sketching throughput. In cases where the label of the partial drawing can not be predicted unambiguously, our system delays the classification decision until more information becomes available. The system is a hierarchical classifier that consists of a semi-supervised clustering followed by supervised classification, so as to deal with the ambiguity involved in classifying partial sketches that may belong to more than one category.

40|$|We study {{integrations}} over light-cone momenta in {{the high}} energy effective action of QCD. After {{a brief review of}} the effective action, we arrive on a regularization mechanism from matching of effective <b>action</b> <b>diagrams</b> with QCD diagrams, which we apply to a re-derivation of the reggeized gluon and of the BFKL-equation. We study consequences of the proposed regularization on the analytic structure of 2 → 3 and 2 → 4 production amplitudes in the Multi-Regge-Kinematics. We derive a certain part of the 1 -loop corrections to the production vertex and demonstrate that they yield the on-set of corrections demanded by the Steinmann-relations. The Reggeon-Particle- 2 -Reggeon vertex is determined and applied to the construction of various signature configurations of the production amplitudes. We extend the proposed regularization method to states of three and four reggeized gluons and propose a supplement to the effective Lagrangian. We derive vertices for the 1 − 3 and 2 − 4 reggeized-gluon-transition inside the elastic amplitude and verify that signature conservation is obeyed. Integral equations for the state of three and four reggeized gluons are formulated and shown to be in accordance with a result by Bartels and Wüsthoff.

As a system in and of itself, an architecting tool can be subject to betterments, adjustments, and improvements, which add to its usefulness for the architecting community. The implementation of architecting principles within a tool can increase the efficiency of that tool and its user. The research described in this paper provides a functional model comparison of some standard functional notations, and specifies an architect's need for additional graphical indicators on executable diagrams. These indicators are intended to deliver improved visualization of disconnects among various levels of functional decomposition on executable diagrams to improve {{the efficiency of the}} design process. This paper proposes small enhancements to current executable modeling notations to graphically identify decompositional disconnects on EFFBD and <b>action</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The suggested implementation detects and illustrates inconsistencies in decompositional relationships, which generate errors if these relationships are overlooked by the user during diagram construction. Several examples are shown to portray the lack of graphical indicators on executable diagrams, forcing the user to manually identify illogical relationships, and rerun the simulation until it succeeds in running to completion; this is a process that can be very time consuming as a result of user error. Proposed notational enhancements increase efficiency by lessening repetitive efforts and time troubleshooting these user errors causing discrepancies found in simulation...|$|R
