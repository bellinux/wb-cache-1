5|$|Thucydides {{says that}} 200 Phoenician ships were {{captured}} and destroyed. It {{is highly unlikely}} that this occurred during the apparently brief naval battle, so these were probably grounded ships captured after the battle and destroyed with fire, <b>as</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case at Mycale. Plutarch says that 200 ships were captured, in addition to those that were destroyed or fled. It is possible that 'destroyed' in this context means sunk during the battle, since the Greeks would almost certainly have destroyed the ships that they captured as well (as Thucydides indeed implies). Since Thucydides only explicitly gives the number of ships destroyed, it is possible to reconcile Plutarch's and Thucydides's numbers, {{but it is not clear}} that this is the best approach. There are no estimates in the ancient sources for casualties amongst the troops of either side.|$|E

Combined, the Liberals and NDP had 154 seats – one short of the total needed for the balance of power. <b>As</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case with Liberal minorities in the past, the NDP were {{in a position to}} make gains on the party's priorities, such as fighting health care privatization, fulfilling Canada's obligation to the Kyoto Protocol, and electoral reform.|$|E

25|$|The Special Session of the MPR {{was held}} in November 1998 and Wiranto cracked down on protesters who were against the Special Session, killing 8 and {{injuring}} 226. Despite this setback, Wiranto continued to build an image as a reformer. In January 1999, he met with reformist leaders and in April 1999, supervised {{the establishment of the}} Republic of Indonesia Police (POLRI) as an autonomous entity rather than subordinate to ABRI. ABRI also went through a name change and became known as TNI. Wiranto also supervised security during the 1999 Legislative Elections during which TNI and POLRI adopted a neutral role rather than support Golkar <b>as</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case during Suharto's regime.|$|E

The club's two joint major sponsors, car manufacturer Hyundai and confectionery company Mars, were unchanged from 2010. As in previous years, the club's primary home ground was Etihad Stadium, with home games expecting to draw larger crowds played at the M.C.G., and with traditional home ground Visy Park serving as the training and administrative base. <b>As</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case every year since 2003, Carlton has a full alignment with the Northern Bullants in the Victorian Football League, allowing Carlton-listed players {{to play with the}} Bullants when not selected in AFL matches.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, Elijah Delmedigo (c.1458 – c.1493), in his Bechinat ha-Dat {{endeavored}} {{to show that}} the Zohar could not be attributed to Shimon bar Yochai, by a number of arguments. He claims that if it were his work, the Zohar would have been mentioned by the Talmud, <b>as</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case with other works of the Talmudic period; he claims that had bar Yochai known by divine revelation the hidden meaning of the precepts, his decisions on Jewish law from the Talmudic period would have been adopted by the Talmud, that it would not contain the names of rabbis who lived at a later period than that of bar Yochai; he claims that if the Kabbalah was a revealed doctrine, {{there would have been no}} divergence of opinion among the Kabbalists concerning the mystic interpretation of the precepts.|$|E
25|$|Schnitzler was branded as a pornographer {{after the}} release of his play Reigen, in which ten pairs of {{characters}} are shown before and after the sexual act, leading and ending with a prostitute. The furore after this play was couched in the strongest anti-semitic terms. Reigen was made into a French language film in 1950 by the German-born director Max Ophüls as La Ronde. The film achieved considerable success in the English-speaking world, with the result that Schnitzler's play is better known there under its French title. Richard Oswald's film The Merry-Go-Round (1920), Roger Vadim's Circle of Love (1964) and Otto Schenk's Der Reigen (1973) are also based on the play. More recently, in Fernando Meirelles' film 360, Schnitzler's play was provided with a new version, <b>as</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case with many other TV and film productions.|$|E

25|$|The wars {{following}} the French Revolution saw {{large quantities of}} the finest art, paintings in particular, carefully selected for appropriation by the French armies or the secular regimes they established. Many were sent to Paris for the Louvre (some to eventually be returned, others not) or local museums established by the French, like the Brera in Milan. Suppression of monasteries, which had been under way for decades under Catholic Enlightened despots of the Ancien Régime, for example in the Edict on Idle Institutions (1780) of Joseph II of Austria, intensified considerably. By 1830 much of the best Catholic religious art was on public display in museums, <b>as</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case ever since. This undoubtedly widened access to many works, and promoted {{public awareness of the}} heritage of Catholic art, but at a cost, as objects came to be regarded as of primarily artistic rather than religious significance, and were seen out of their original context and the setting they were designed for.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case {{since the}} SMI {{purchase}} of BMS, improvements continued {{in and around}} the Speedway in 2002. The season saw the addition of a long-awaited infield pedestrian tunnel, allowing access {{into and out of the}} infield during on-track activity. Also in 2002, a new building was constructed in the infield to house driver meetings. That same year also witnessed the christening of a new BMS Victory Lane atop the newly constructed building. Kurt Busch won the 2002 Food City 500 on March 24 and became the first Cup winner in the new BMS winner's circle. Additional improvements in 2002 included new scoreboards located on the facing of the suites in Turns 2 and 3. On Monday, August 26, 2002, work began on the most ambitious construction project since SMI's purchase of BMS in 1996. The entire backstretch, including the Speedway's last remaining concrete seats, was demolished. The new backstretch increased the venue’s seating capacity to more than 160,000. The new backstretch includes three levels of seating and is topped with 52 luxury skybox suites. These seats are also named for leading NASCAR figures, with Richard Petty, Cale Yarborough and Junior Johnson each having a section of the new seats named for them; Dale Earnhardt was given a section on top in his memory.|$|E

2500|$|Much <b>as</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> {{case for}} Spain's two other major {{economic}} poles (Madrid and Catalonia), the Basque Country received significant immigration from other poorer regions of Spain, {{due to its}} higher level of economic development and early industrialization.
