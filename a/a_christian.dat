5|$|In about 630, Christianity was {{permanently}} re-established in East Anglia when Sigeberht and Ecgric succeeded to rule jointly.

5|$|It is {{not known}} when Æthelberht became <b>a</b> <b>Christian.</b> It is possible, despite Bede's account, that he already was <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> before Augustine's mission arrived. It is likely that Liudhard and Bertha pressed Æthelberht to {{consider}} becoming <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> {{before the arrival of}} the mission, and it is also likely that a condition of Æthelberht's marriage to Bertha was that Æthelberht would consider conversion. Conversion via the influence of the Frankish court would have been seen as an explicit recognition of Frankish overlordship, however, so it is possible that Æthelberht's delay of his conversion until it could be accomplished via Roman influence, might have been an assertion of independence from Frankish control. It also has been argued that Augustine's hesitation—he turned back to Rome, asking to be released from the mission—is an indication that Æthelberht was a pagan at the time Augustine was sent.|$|E
