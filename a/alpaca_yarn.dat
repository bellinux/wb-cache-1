2500|$|The first European importations of alpaca fiber {{were into}} Spain. Spain {{transferred}} that fiber to Germany and France. Apparently, <b>alpaca</b> <b>yarn</b> was spun in England {{for the first}} time about the year 1808, but the fiber was condemned as an unworkable material. In 1830, Benjamin Outram, of Greetland, near Halifax, appears to have reattempted spinning it, and again it was condemned. These two attempts failed due to the style of fabric into which the yarn was woven—a type of camlet. With the introduction of cotton warps into Bradford trade about 1836, the true qualities of alpaca could be assessed as it was developed into fabric. It is not known where the cotton warp and mohair or alpaca weft plain-cloth came from, but it was this simple and ingenious structure which enabled Titus Salt, then a young Bradford manufacturer, to use alpaca successfully. Bradford is still the great spinning and manufacturing center for alpaca. Large quantities of yarns and cloths are exported annually to the European continent and the US, although the quantities vary with the fashions in vogue.

Currently, the Awamaki Women's Cooperative Program includes 60 women in two weaving cooperatives in Indigenous communities, a knitting cooperative of over 15 women and a sewing cooperative of three. Awamaki has recently started working with a group 10 young Quechua adults who will be hand-spinning luxury <b>alpaca</b> <b>yarns</b> for export. Awamaki operates a fair trade store in Ollantaytambo where they sell woven, knit and hand-spun goods that the cooperatives produce.|$|R

The clothing was modelled by both Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe in the 1950s.|$|R

50|$|The Aymara {{people are}} {{indigenous}} to the Bolivian and Peruvian altiplano, {{and make up}} a quarter of Bolivia's population. Latest estimates predict about 300 families in the affluence zone {{of the park and}} about 100 in the park's interior. Much of the Aymara population participates in llama and <b>alpaca</b> herding and <b>yarn</b> spinning. Circular houses, traditional to the Aymara, can still be found today. The Aymara people also have the unique tradition of handing down historic textiles through the generations as inherited wealth. Because the Aymara people rely so heavily on the natural environment, they take on a protectoral role regarding its use. For example, the Aymara recently protested the Dakar Rally, an off road race taking place through Bolivia's salt flats for the first time. The Aymara cited fears of environmental damage from litter and ruts in the white landscape from the vehicles as cause for concern.|$|R
