40|$|A {{model for}} chronic Cryptococcus neoformans {{meningitis}} in corticosteroid-treated rabbits {{was used to}} determine the influence of pre-formed <b>agglutinating</b> <b>antibody</b> to cryptococcal polysaccharide on the progress of this infection. Immunized rabbits developed serum <b>agglutinating</b> <b>antibody</b> with a geometric mean titre of 1 : 32, but none was detected in cerebrospinal fluid. Prior immunization did not enhance immunity to infection, had no effect on the number of viable cryptococci in cerebrospinal fluid, and did not prevent dissemination outside the central nervous system. Future investigations in this field should focus on cellular rather than humoral defence mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|Immunoglobulin A (IgA) was {{prepared}} from samples of parotid saliva collected from two individuals over a 150 -day period.

The agglutinating activity of the standardized IgA preparations against these strains was found to change over time, whereas the agglutination patterns of IgA prepared from saliva samples collected 3 days apart were generally similar. Differences in agglutination titers were also observed between IgA samples prepared from saliva collected on day 0 and day 150.

The tests agreed within one dilution with 182 of the 207 sera tested for an 87. 9 % rate of agreement. When titers were not the same, those obtained with the dithiothreitol test were more frequently lower than higher than those obtained with the 2 -mercaptoethanol test. Sixteen sera that showed a titer with the 2 -mercaptoethanol test were negative with the dithiothreitol test and two that showed a titer with the dithiothreitol test were negative with the 2 -mercaptoethanol test.

40|$|Dairy cows {{from five}} herds were {{assigned}} to receive a commercial Pasteurella haemolytica vaccine or no vaccine at all, administered at six and three weeks before parturition. Vaccination was associated with increased leukotoxin neutralizing serum antibody titers in the dams (p < 0. 001), and with increased titers in colostrum (p < 0. 001). Vaccination of dams also had a significant association with increased passive leukotoxin neutralizing antibody titers in their calves (p < 0. 001). Vaccination was also associated with increased indirect <b>agglutinating</b> <b>antibody</b> titers in serum of the dams (p < 0. 001). In the analysis of <b>agglutinating</b> <b>antibody</b> titers in colostral whey the interaction "vaccination*herd" {{was found to be}} significant (p < 0. 001), indicating that the effects of vaccination on colostral titers were not consistent from herd to herd. The analysis was repeated, stratifying by herd. Vaccination was associated with increased <b>agglutinating</b> <b>antibody</b> titers in colostrum (p < 0. 05) in three herds of the five in the study. In two of these three herds there were significant increases in passive neonatal titers associated with vaccination. In the remaining herd the mean IgG 1 level in the calves was consistent with failure of passive transfer of immunoglobulins (IgG 1 < 8. 0 g/L). These results suggest that preparturient vaccination of dairy cows can induce modest increases in passive antibody titers to antigens of Pasteurella haemolytica in their calves, but the antigen of interest and the population being studied can affect the outcome...|$|E

40|$|Eighty-two major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) swine leukocyte antigen (SLA) defined miniature pigs from 16 litters were examined for serum <b>agglutinating</b> <b>antibody</b> titer and O-polysaccharide (O-ps) specific peripheral blood lymphocyte blastogenesis following two parenteral vaccinations with 1 x 10 (8) aromatic-dependent (aroA) Salmonella typhimurium and following oral challenge with 1 x 10 (12) virulent parent S. typhimurium. Least mean squares analysis allowed separate determinations {{of the effects of}} MHC genotype, dam, sire and litter. In most cases only litter significantly influenced both lymphocyte blastogenesis and antibody titer before and after vaccination and following challenge. However, pig SLA haplotype significantly influenced the degree of O-ps specific lymphocyte proliferation six days after the second vaccination (p < 0. 004). Lymphocyte proliferation and serum <b>agglutinating</b> <b>antibody</b> response six days after primary vaccination were negatively correlated (r 2 = - 0. 68, p < 0. 001).

40|$|The {{formation}} of rabbit antibodies, capable of sensitizing homologous skin, (reagins), was completely inhibited by passive administration of serum containing {{large quantities of}} 7 S antibody 24 hours before or after antigen injection. No evident effect on reagin formation was noted when passive antibody was administered 8 days after antigen injection although some suppression of <b>agglutinating</b> <b>antibody</b> synthesis was observed. In rabbits not treated with passive antibody the injection of haemocyanin resulted in the {{formation of}} reagins reaching maximum serum concentrations 1 and 3 weeks following antigen injection.

40|$|The {{protective}} value of antibody to the K 1 capsular polysaccharide antigen of Escherichia coli {{was investigated in}} a newborn rat model of E. coli K 1 infection. Pregnant rats were immunized intravenously with E. coli, and the agglutinating titer to meningococcal group B polysaccharide, which is identical to K 1 polysaccharide, was measured in the serum of rats and their offspring. Convalescent serum from rat mothers showed an increased antibody titer in animals injected twice but not once with E. coli K 1. Although no <b>agglutinating</b> <b>antibody</b> was detected in the serum of rat pups, animals suckled by mothers having a meningococcal group B agglutinating titer of 1 : 8 or greater had reduced infection and mortality rates after intraperitoneal injection with E. coli K 1 compared with animals suckled by mothers having a low titer of <b>agglutinating</b> <b>antibody</b> (P less than 0. 05). In addition, greater protection could be conferred on rat sucklings by oral supplementation with a horse serum rich in antibody to meningococcal group B polysaccharide, suggesting that antibody was abosorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and by itself could be protective. These studies demonstrated that antibody to the capsular polysaccharide of E. coli K 1 altered the severity of E. coli K 1 infection.

Placental injury was induced by intravenous inoculation of Escherichia coli endotoxin or spores of Aspergillus fumigatus into pregnant ewes at days 99 or 100 of gestation respectively. Placental infarction, thrombosis of maternal placental vessels and variable neutrophil infiltrate characterized lesions produced by A. fumigatus. Endotoxin treated ewes developed marked placental edema, congestion, hemorrhage and focal loss of uterine epithelium. Human red blood cell <b>agglutinating</b> <b>antibody</b> was not detected in placental or fetal fluids obtained from ewes with either of the above placental lesions. Placentitis of undetermined etiology was observed in seven ewes. Two ewes had received A. fumigatus, two had received endotoxin and three were untreated ewes.

In this study, serologic results confirmed a high (50 - 94 %) incidence of exposure to Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, the causative agent of CLA, in mature, unvaccinated sheep in southern Alberta. To assess the efficacy and impact of vaccination with 2 commercial (Glanvac- 6 and Case-Vac) and 1 experimental (WC+ MDP-GDP) CLA vaccines, a series of 3 field trials in 3249 ewes and lambs was conducted in affected flocks from 1992 - 1996. Efficacy was assessed from the serological response to vaccination, prevalence and size of injection site reactions by treatment, and the incidence of CLA abscesses. Overall, <b>agglutinating</b> <b>antibody</b> titres to C. pseudotuberculosis in lambs vaccinated with WC+MDP-GDP and Case-Vac remained significantly elevated above nonvaccinated control lambs for the 12 mo period after the initial vaccination.
