25|$|It is {{relatively}} difficult {{to start a}} housing co-op because if the idea is, for instance, to build a building or group of buildings to house the members, this usually takes a significant mortgage loan for which <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> will want assurances of responsibility. It may also take {{a year or more}} for the members to organize the design and construction, as well as time and foresight to establish even basic organizational policies. It is rare that these kinds of skills of organization are available in a random group of people who often have pressures on their existing housing. It may be somewhat easier to organize a group of closely related housing units. This opportunity may arise, for example, if an existing apartment building's owner is thinking about selling it.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all {{legitimate}} {{e-mail messages}} from companies {{to their customers}} contain an item of information that is not readily available to phishers. Some companies, for example PayPal, always address their customers by their username in emails, so if an email addresses the recipient in a generic fashion ("Dear PayPal customer") {{it is likely to}} be an attempt at phishing. Furthermore, PayPal offers various methods to determine spoof emails and advises users to forward suspicious emails to their spoof@PayPal.com domain to investigate and warn other customers. Emails from banks and credit card companies often include partial account numbers. However, recent research has shown that the public do not typically distinguish between the first few digits and the last few digits of an account number—a significant problem since the first few digits are often the same for all clients of <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institution.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{automated}} teller machine (ATM) is {{a computerized}} telecommunications device that provides the clients of <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> with access to financial transactions in a public space {{without the need for}} a cashier, human clerk or bank teller.

The idea was met with a great deal of skepticism after Citicorp tested it. In later years and after Simjian filed 20 patents related to the device, the idea and the gradual usage of ATM's became more widespread around the world.|$|E
