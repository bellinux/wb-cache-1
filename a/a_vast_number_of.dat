The conflict produced <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> displaced persons. It is estimated that there were over a million refugees in areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina outside VRS control at the end of 1994, while the area's total population was about 2.2 million.

Croatia hosted {{a large proportion of the}} Bosniak and Croat refugees; by November 1992 there were around 333,000 registered, and an estimated 100,000 unregistered, refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina in Croatia. The refugees left their homes under varied circumstances. The ethnic violence committed by Bosnian Serbs against civilians resulted in the greatest number of civilian victims in the Bosnian war, culminating in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.|$|E

Thus, {{variability}} {{has to be}} dealt with in all phases of the development process, in particular during model-based development of software-intensive functionality using Matlab/Simulink. Currently, variability is often encoded within a functional model leading to so called 150 %-models which easily become very complex and do not scale for larger product lines. To counter these problems, we propose a modular variability modeling approach for Matlab/Simulink based on the concept of delta modeling [8, 9, 24]. A functional variant is described by a delta encapsulating a set of modifications. A sequence of deltas can be applied to a core product to derive the desired variant. We present a prototypical implementation, which is integrated into Matlab/Simulink and offers graphical editing of delta models. Comment: 8 pages, 8 figures.

5|$|Early Gaelic law tracts, first {{written down}} in the ninth century, reveal a society highly {{concerned}} with kinship, status, honour and the regulation of blood feuds.

In the twelfth century, and certainly in the thirteenth, strong continental legal influences began to have more effect, such as Canon law and various Anglo-Norman practices. Pre-fourteenth century law among the native Scots is not always well attested, but extensive knowledge of early Gaelic Law gives some basis for its reconstruction. In the earliest extant Scottish legal manuscript, there is a document called Leges inter Brettos et Scottos. The document survives in Old French, and is almost certainly a French translation of an earlier Gaelic document.

Type 1 pneumocytes are squamous epithelial cells which are characterized by a superficial layer consisting of large, thin, scale-like cells; they also cover 95% of the alveolar surface, although they are only half as numerous as Type 2 pneumocytes. Type 2 pneumocytes are important in that they can proliferate and differentiate into type 1 pneumocytes, which cannot replicate and are susceptible to <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> toxic insults. Type 2 pneumocytes are also important because they secrete pulmonary surfactant(PS), which consists 80-90% of phospholipids phosphatidyglycerol(PG), phosphaditylinositol (PI) and 5-10% of surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, AND SP-D). PS is synthesized as lamellar bodies, which are structures consisting of closely packed bilayers that are secreted and then undergo transformation into a morphological form called tubular myelin. PS {{plays an important role in}} maintaining normal respiratory mechanics by reducing alveolar surface tension. By lowering alveolar surface tension, PS reduces the energy required to inflate the lungs, and reduces the likelihood of alveolar collapse during expiration. Loosely attached to these alveoli sacs are the alveolar macrophages that protect the lungs from a broad array of microbes and aerosols by devouring and ingesting them through phagocytosis.|$|R

The research area related to outlier detection is large and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> available approaches is constantly growing. Most of the approaches produce a binary result: either outlier or not. In this work approaches {{that are able to}} detect outliers by producing a p-value estimate are investigated. Approaches that estimate p-values are interesting since it allows their results to easily be compared against each other, followed over time, or be used with a variable threshold. Four approaches are subjected to a variety of tests to attempt to measure their suitability when the data is distributed in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> ways. The first approach, the R 2 S, is developed at Halmstad University. Based on finding the mid-point of the data. The second approach is based on one-class support vector machines (OCSVM). The third and fourth approaches are both based on conformal anomaly detection (CAD), but using different nonconformity measures (NCM). The Mahalanobis distance to the mean and a variation of k-NN are used as NCMs. The R 2 S and the CAD Mahalanobis are both good at estimating p-values from data generated by unimodal and symmetrical distributions. The CAD k-NN is good at estimating p-values when the data is generated by a bimodal or extremely asymmetric distribution. The OCSVM does not excel in any scenario, but produces good average results in most of the tests. The approaches are also subjected to real data, where they all produce comparable results...|$|R

40|$|Abbie, {{an adult}} Moluccan Cockatoo, {{presented}} to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals on July 2, 2007 with a two week history of voice change, a one week history of audible wheezing, and a two day history of anorexia. One week prior to presentation, the patient {{was brought to the}} referring veterinarian and was treated for presumptive aspergillosis. At the time of presentation to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals, the available laboratory results demonstrated an unremarkable complete blood count (CBC) and chemistry panel, and negative chlamydial titers (< 10). Upon presentation to Cornell, Abbie was quiet, alert, and responsive. Abbie was dyspneic, open mouth breathing, with pronounced audible wheezing. After oxygen cage stabilization, the patient was placed under general anesthesia and blood was drawn revealing a mild heterophilia, lymphopenia, monocytosis and mild anemia. Radiographic findings were highly suggestive of a tracheal mass. Tracheal endoscopy was performed, demonstrating a white mass occluding most of the trachea {{at the level of the}} syrinx. Approximately 80 - 90 % of the mass was debulked. The aerobic culture from the mass did not yield any organisms, however in-house cytology demonstrated organisms consistent with Aspergillus.
