40|$|Present {{land vehicle}} {{navigation}} relies {{mostly on the}} Global Positioning System (GPS) that may be interrupted or deteriorated in urban areas. In order to obtain continuous positioning services in all environments, GPS can be integrated with inertial sensors and vehicle odometer using Kalman filtering (KF). For car navigation, low-cost positioning solutions based on MEMS-based inertial sensors are utilized. To further reduce the cost, a reduced inertial sensor system (RISS) consisting of only one gyroscope and speed measurement (obtained from the car odometer) is integrated with GPS. The MEMS-based gyroscope measurement deteriorates over time due to different errors like the bias drift. These errors may lead to large <b>azimuth</b> <b>errors</b> and mitigating the <b>azimuth</b> <b>errors</b> requires robust modeling of both linear and nonlinear effects. Therefore, this paper presents a solution based on Parallel Cascade Identification (PCI) module that models the <b>azimuth</b> <b>errors</b> and is augmented to KF. The proposed augmented KF-PCI method can handle both linear and nonlinear system errors as the linear parts of the errors are modeled inside the KF and the nonlinear and residual parts of the <b>azimuth</b> <b>errors</b> are modeled by PCI. The performance of this method is examined using road test experiments in a land vehicle...|$|R

In contrast to the ILS approach, which displays lateral and vertical position, the VOR/DME approach only shows the lateral position of the aircraft and its range to the runway.

(1) Estimate the <b>azimuth</b> phase <b>error</b> term firstly, and then calculate the residual RCM from the estimated <b>azimuth</b> phase <b>error</b> [4]. In [4], the range compressed data is processed {{to a new}} coarser range resolution so that the presumption of autofocus is met. Therefore, the <b>azimuth</b> phase <b>errors</b> can be obtained using autofocus method from the new range compressed data and then the residual RCM can be calculated and compensated. However, as the <b>azimuth</b> phase <b>errors</b> are estimated in coarse resolution, the estimation precision of <b>azimuth</b> phase <b>errors</b> and residual RCM cannot satisfy the demands of high-resolution BFSAR. (2) Estimate residual RCM by making use {{of the relationship between}} <b>azimuth</b> phase <b>errors</b> and residual RCM. Mao et al.

Using this relationship, a 2 -D autofocus method, which can compensate the <b>azimuth</b> phase <b>errors</b> and residual RCM simultaneously, is proposed. Nevertheless, this relationship is valid just in the case of spotlight SAR data, so that applicability of this method is limited. (3) Estimate the residual RCM independently. The residual RCM correction method proposed in [5] is based on range alignment algorithm which is utilized in translational motion compensation on inverse SAR (ISAR)[6, 7]. However, parametric model of the range displacement in [6] restricts the estimation accuracy, and the interpolation procedure in [7] requires exhaustive computation.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} perceptual properties of common experience is that the perceived shapes of known objects are constant despite movements about them which transform their projections on the retina. This perceptual ability is one aspect of shape constancy (Thouless, 1931; Metzger, 1953; Borresen and Lichte, 1962). It requires that the viewer be able to sense and discount his or her relative position and orientation with respect to a viewed object. This discounting of relative position may be derived directly from the ranging information provided from stereopsis, from motion parallax, from vestibularly sensed rotation and translation, or from corollary information associated with voluntary movement. It is argued that: (1) errors in exocentric judgements of the azimuth of a target generated on an electronic perspective display are not viewpoint-independent, but are influenced by the specific geometry of their perspective projection; (2) elimination of binocular conflict by replacing electronic displays with actual scenes eliminates a previously reported equidistance tendency in <b>azimuth</b> <b>error,</b> but the viewpoint dependence remains; (3) the pattern of exocentrically judged <b>azimuth</b> <b>error</b> in real scenes viewed with a viewing direction depressed 22 deg and rotated + or - 22 deg with respect to a reference direction could not be explained by overestimation of the depression angle, i. e., a slant overestimation...|$|E
