40|$|We {{think that}} parceled constructions {{are a part}} of a general system of {{linguistic}} mechanisms which fulfill advertiser's stylistic strategy and the whole of which gives an opportunity to send the message of an advertising text to a consumer effectively and expressively, to impact by way of large-scale sale of goods/ services. This polyfunctional construction of expressive actualizing syntax intensifies the process of positioning of an <b>advertised</b> <b>item,</b> due to which its idea must remain in minds of potential customers. Hereafter, remembering about the image of a favourite item, they would like to check the correspondence of linguistic code to a real advertising item...|$|E
40|$|Works {{of popular}} culture such as songs or films {{referred}} to in printed advertisements can {{be understood in terms}} of intertextuality as a discourse strategy. These references allow recipients' mental space processing of the advertisement, thus enabling the recipients to become co-authors of the message. Multigeneric intertextuality, i. e., exhibiting the switch of genres, is a major type of mass culture intertextual reference. This paper deals with its employment in ads and its twofold function of building a desired emotional attitude towards the <b>advertised</b> <b>item</b> through exploring the mental space; and enhancing memorability by contextualizing the product in a novel way. This capacity makes intertextuality an effective advertising discourse strategy...|$|E

Food retailing organizations advertised turkey at low prices and margins at Thanksgiving and Christmas when consumer demand for turkey is traditionally strong. Prior to these holidays, food retailing organizations in a market simultaneously advertised turkey at identical prices and with little product differentiation thus limiting the effectiveness of turkey as an <b>advertised</b> <b>item</b> to gain competitive advantage for a food retailer...|$|E

Since information consumes primarily the attention of its recipients, the scarcity of attention is becoming the main limiting factor. In this study, we investigate the impact of advertisement pressure on a cultural market where consumers have a limited attention capacity. A model of competition for attention is developed and investigated analytically and by simulation. Advertisement {{is found to be}} much more effective when attention capacity of agents is extremely scarce. We have observed that the market share of the <b>advertised</b> <b>item</b> improves if dummy items are introduced to the market while the strength of the advertisement is kept constant...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This article {{presents}} an empirical study of paintings that {{have failed to}} meet their reserve price at auction. In the art trade, it is often claimed that when an <b>advertised</b> <b>item</b> goes unsold at auction, it will sell for less in the future. We have constructed a new dataset specifically {{for the purpose of}} testing this proposition. To preview our results, we find that paintings which come to auction and failed return significantly less when they are eventually sold than those paintings that have not been advertised at auction between sales. These lower returns may occur because of common value effects, idiosyncratic downward trends in tastes, or changes in the seller’s reserve price. JEL Classification D 44 L 8...|$|E

40|$|Even though {{advertisements}} {{represent a}} world of its own, they are an inevitable part {{of different kinds of}} media. The purpose of advertising is not only to promote a product but also to transfer messages, values and ideas in order to make emotional connections with brands. By building emotional attachment, advertisers increase and strengthen consumers’ responses. The promoting of the advertisements’ images becomes much more important than promoting the product itself. Nowadays, an increasing interest in representing a human body along with different kinds of products and services has become a commonplace among advertisers. Representation of the body is a socially constructed phenomenon. In other words, social processes shape perceptions of our bodies and these perceptions (re) create human experiences of the body. The authors’ approach includes qualitative discourse analysis of advertisements. The objective was to identify the relationship between the human body and textual messages as integral components of the <b>advertised</b> <b>item</b> taken in consideration, as well as {{the ways in which they}} interact with the reader’s overall experience. For this purpose, different advertisements that contain visual and textual messages representing human bodies have been analysed. They were all published in the following lifestyle magazines: Cosmopolitan, Playboy, Men’s Health, during 2012 and 2013. The authors conclude that media representations of a human body as social phenomena perceive value and treat the body in different ways depending on the relationship between the advertisement, the textual message and the human body...|$|E

It was used to produce many <b>advertising</b> <b>items</b> and was made by Doulton from 1901 to 1939. The concept of Series Ware was to decorate a range of different ceramic items, e.g. plates, vases etc. with the same theme/ pattern thus making them belong together as part of a series.

5000|$|Commercial ads often seek to {{generate}} increased consumption {{of their products}} or services through [...] "branding," [...] which associates a product name or image with certain qualities {{in the minds of}} consumers.

Non-commercial advertisers who spend money to <b>advertise</b> <b>items</b> other than a consumer product or service include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations and governmental agencies. Non-profit organizations may use free modes of persuasion, such as a public service announcement.

50|$|A {{bulletin}} board (pinboard, pin board, noticeboard, or notice board in British English) is a surface {{intended for the}} posting of public messages, for example, to <b>advertise</b> <b>items</b> wanted or for sale, announce events, or provide information.
