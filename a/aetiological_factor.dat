40|$|THE {{possibility}} that contamination of dietary staples by aflatoxins {{could be an}} <b>aetiological</b> <b>factor</b> in liver cancer was originally suggested by le Breton, Frayssinet and Boy (1962), soon after the outbreak of Turkey " X " dlisease in Britain and the realization that a fungal metabolite was involved. Further experimental and epidemiological research supported this suggestion and Oettle (1965), reviewing the situation, concluded that a mycotoxin hypothesis fitted the known liver cancer data {{better than any other}} suspected <b>aetiological</b> <b>factor.</b> Little has been added over the last decade to ou...|$|E
40|$|Serum {{lysozyme}} (muramidase) estimation is a simple, {{convenient and}} useful laboratory investigation. A {{review of the}} literature shows that lysozyme has been implicated as an <b>aetiological</b> <b>factor</b> in various disorders, and credited with being a prognostic indicator in acute myeloid leukaemia, but these promises have not been fulfilled. This low molecular weight protein is found in the urine of some patients with renal tubular disorders, but some workers have emphasized its importance as a causal agent in hypokalaemia of acute myeloid leukaemia. Research should be concentrated on muramidase as an expression of cell functions rather than as an <b>aetiological</b> <b>factor.</b> Hypokalaemia in acute myeloid leukaemia may be caused by an unidentified substance of molecular weight similar to that of lysozyme...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Teeth {{hypomineralization}} {{that involves}} molars only, or molars and incisors {{is known as}} disease Molar Incisor Hypomineralization (MIH). Aetiology of MIH is not known, however, factors responsible for this disease {{are present in the}} first year of life. The aim of this research was to identify possible <b>aetiological</b> <b>factors</b> responsible for the occurrence of this disease. Material and Methods. The study included eight years old children from the municipality of Foca. Parents who gave their consent for the participation of children in the study completed a questionnaire in which they listed <b>aetiological</b> <b>factors</b> described in the literature to be responsible for the emergence of hypomineralization. Modified DDE index (Modified DDE Index for Use in Epidemiological Surveys) was used to estimate hypomineralization on all teeth; however, MIH changes were classified separately. Results. More than ninety different factors may be responsible for enamel defects. Possible <b>aetiological</b> <b>factors</b> listed in the literature are: premature birth, low weight of newborns, hypoxia, metabolic disorder of calcium and phosphate, fever, genetic factors, etc. Results did not confirm statistical significance for any of examined <b>aetiological</b> <b>factors.</b> Conclusion. In this study a retrospective analysis of data was performed. Etiological factors of MIH were identified but the most responsible for MIH were not determined...|$|R

The choice of treatment should {{be guided by}} the symptoms, the supposed <b>aetiological</b> <b>factors</b> {{and the age of}} the subject. Surgery is rarely indicated in the majority of the patients with vertigo. Surgical solutions should be proposed for cases of chronic incapacitating vertigo that are refractory to medical or physical treatment. The surgical procedures possible today target <b>aetiological</b> <b>factors</b> or attempt to cancel information coming from the vestibular organ. We will refer to the latter as "symptomatic treatment"...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that spinal osteoporosis is an <b>aetiological</b> <b>factor</b> in the development of Scheuermann's disease in adolescents. Clinical and radiological data was collected on 12 individuals with Scheuermann's disease (SD). Lumbar spine bone mineral density (L 2 - 4) was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Age and sex-matched adolescents were used as controls. The number of standard deviations from the mean of age and sex-matched controls were calculated. In regards to results, SD patients demonstrated high bone densities of between 1 and 1. 5 standard deviations above the mean of age-matched controls. These results suggest that osteoporosis is not an <b>aetiological</b> <b>factor</b> in Scheuermann's disease and that bone density measurements may indeed be higher than aged-matched controls in the general population...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Caries {{is still}} a {{prevalent}} condition in 5 -year-old children. At present, knowledge regarding some <b>aetiological</b> <b>factors,</b> like deciduous molar hypomineralization (DMH), is limited. AIM: To investigate <b>aetiological</b> <b>factors</b> both directly and indirectly associated with caries in second primary molars. DESIGN: Of 974 children {{invited to participate in}} the study, 386 children were examined clinically with visual detection of caries. Only carious lesions determined to have reached the dentine were recorded. Information about tooth brushing frequency, education level of the mother, and country of birth of mother and child, was collected by means of a multiple-choice questionnaire. Parents of 452 children filled in the questionnaire. Complete clinical and questionnaire data were available for 242 children. Statistical analysis of the effect of the independent variables was undertaken using the Pearson's chi-squared test. RESULTS: Deciduous molar hypomineralization (P = 0. 02) and the country of birth of the mother (P < 0. 001) were positively associated with caries prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Deciduous molar hypomineralization and the country of birth of the mother play a role in the prevalence of dental caries. These <b>aetiological</b> <b>factors</b> associated with childhood dental caries need to be investigated further in longitudinal clinical trials...|$|R

40|$|The highest {{incidence}} {{rates for}} {{social anxiety disorder}} (SAD) occur {{during the period from}} late childhood to early adulthood. A number of factors that increase vulnerability for the development of SAD have been proposed in the literature, including genes, temperament, biological factors, cognitive factors, parent factors, life events, peer experiences, performance deficits, general learning mechanisms, and cultural <b>factors.</b> These proposed <b>aetiological</b> <b>factors</b> have been given different weightings in theoretical accounts of the aetiology of SAD. Genes, temperament, cognitive factors, parent factors, life events, and peer experiences are generally emphasised in theoretical accounts, while biological factors, performance deficits, general learning mechanisms, and cultural factors have received less emphasis. The proposed <b>aetiological</b> <b>factors</b> have also been empirically examined to varying extents in the literature. In general, the majority of research into the proposed <b>aetiological</b> <b>factors</b> has been limited by the use of cross-sectional designs and the recruitment of individuals already diagnosed with SAD. Further research is needed to obtain better evidence to evaluate the aetiological role of the proposed factors. Such research will ultimately help to develop efficacious early intervention and prevention strategies for SAD. 27 page(s...|$|R
