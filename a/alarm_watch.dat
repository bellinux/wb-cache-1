50|$|A Bridge Navigational <b>Watch</b> <b>Alarm</b> System, {{abbreviated}} BNWAS, is {{an automatic}} system which sounds an <b>alarm</b> if the <b>watch</b> {{officer on the}} bridge of a ship falls asleep, becomes otherwise incapacitated, or is absent for too long a time. The BNWAS is automatically engaged when the ship's autopilot is activated.|$|R
50|$|In 1956, a Memovox {{featuring}} the Jaeger-LeCoultre Calibre 815 {{became the first}} self-winding <b>alarm</b> <b>watch</b> in history, while shortly thereafter the company marked its 125th anniversary by releasing the Memovox Wordtime. In 1959, the Memovox Deep Sea was equipped with a specific alarm to remind divers to begin their ascension, and in 1965, the Memovox Polaris was released with a patented triple case back to optimise the transmission of sound under water.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, Schnyder {{launched}} the Genghis Khan, the world's first carillon Westminster minute repeater tourbillon with Jaquemarts. In the same year, the Freak won the Watch of the Year award. In 2003, Schnyder and Oechslin once again conspired {{to change the}} face of watchmaking with their Sonata, the world's first <b>alarm</b> <b>watch</b> that could be set 24 hours in advance and had a dual time function. Ulysse Nardin in cooperation with GFD developed the first hairspring for the balance wheel in polycrystalline diamond.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effectiveness of a}} time self-management intervention in the work setting of four adolescents with developmental disabilities. A multiple baseline across participants design was used to examine the adolescents’ ability to independently identify time and initiate work-related activities. Intervention was delivered by instructors at each participant’s work site and involved the use of an <b>alarm</b> <b>watch</b> that sounded at specific intervals to prompt students to check the time. Results indicated that all four participants increased their performance in managing time at work from baseline to intervention. Additionally, although there were variations across participants, overall generalization of the time management skill to a novel environment (i. e., a community site) occurred following intervention...|$|E
50|$|Gretton's {{earliest}} known extant watch {{dates to}} before 1675 {{and is on}} display at the British Museum, London. The watch has crystals on both front and back, the back revealing the gilt brass top plate, which includes a subsidiary seconds dial, even though this is a pre-balance spring watch. Because of its complexity, this certainly would not have been Gretton's first watch. Gretton produced timepieces, clock <b>watches,</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>watches,</b> several forms of repeating watches, and polychrome decorated watches with enamel dials and porcelain boxes. Many of the extant watches retain their boxes and cases; some of the makers of these items can be identified.|$|R
60|$|Long {{before his}} pursuers {{had reached the}} {{courtyard}} and <b>alarmed</b> the <b>watch</b> at the barbican, the American had crawled out upon dry land and hastened across the broad clearing to the patch of stunted trees that grew lower down upon the steep hillside before the castle.|$|R
50|$|The United States also {{reacted with}} <b>alarm</b> as it <b>watched</b> {{developments}} in Iran, {{which had been}} in a state of instability since 1951.|$|R
2500|$|According to David Martin-Clark, {{the reason}} for the wreck of the ship was [...] "the {{watch-keeping}} officer had fallen asleep and the <b>watch</b> <b>alarm</b> had been switched off." ...|$|R
50|$|In practice, {{the overlap}} of these {{extensive}} protected lands with populated areas {{has led to}} mutual habitat encroachment. Protected wildlife has entered agricultural areas, trampling crops and killing livestock. In response, Bhutan has implemented an insurance scheme, begun constructing solar powered <b>alarm</b> fences, <b>watch</b> towers, and search lights, and has provided fodder and salt licks outside human settlement areas to encourage animals to stay away.|$|R
40|$|Like {{adolescents}} in East Asia, Indian middle-class adolescents face {{a highly competitive}} examination system. This study examines the inuence of school demands on the daily time use and subjective states of Indian young people. One hundred urban, middle-class, 8 th-grade students carried <b>alarm</b> <b>watches</b> for 1 week and provided 4764 reports on their activities and subjective states at random times, following the procedures of the Experience Sampling Method. These adolescents were found to spend one third of their waking time in school-related activities, with girls spending more time than boys. Schoolwork generated negative subjective states as reected in low affect state, below-average activation levels, lower feeling of choice, and higher social anxiety. These negative states were most frequent during homework. The trade-off faced by Indian adolescents were evident in the ndings that those who spent more time doing homework experienced lower average emotional states and more internalising problems, while those who spent more time in leisure experienced more favourable states but also reported higher academic anxiety and lower scholastic achievement...|$|R
60|$|Toby, {{too much}} <b>alarmed</b> to speak, <b>watched</b> the doctor's every {{movement}} {{as he made}} {{an examination of the}} wounded boy, and listened to the accounts the men gave {{of the way in which}} the accident had happened.|$|R
60|$|The noise, however, <b>alarmed</b> the <b>watch</b> below; {{who were}} just pouring up from the {{hatchway}} when they were attacked by the sailors with drawn cutlasses, and were speedily beaten below, and the hatches secured over them. Bob had posted himself, {{with two of the}} men, at the cabin door; and as the officers rushed out, on hearing the noise, they were knocked down and secured. As soon as this was effected, Bob looked round over the side.|$|R
60|$|He {{closed the}} door behind them, and the other door into the darkened dining room. He even took a precautionary glance out of the window of the porch. And these movements, which ordinarily might have aroused her curiosity, if not her <b>alarm,</b> she <b>watched</b> with a {{profound}} indifference. He took a stand before the Japanese screen in front of the fireplace, thrust his hands in his pockets, cleared his throat, and surveyed her from her white shoulders to the gold-embroidered tips of her slippers.|$|R
6000|$|Shovel did object for a time, {{but after}} a wrangle he gave up the ticket, {{intending}} to take it from Tommy when primed with the necessary tale. So they parted until evening, and Tommy returned to Elspeth, secretive but elated. For {{the rest of the}} day he was in thought, now waggling his head smugly over some dark, unutterable design and again looking a little scared. In growing <b>alarm</b> she <b>watched</b> his face, and at last she slipped upon her knees, but he had her up at once and said, reproachfully: ...|$|R
5000|$|The lever {{escapement}} {{was invented by}} British clockmaker Thomas Mudge around 1755, and improved by Abraham-Louis Breguet (1787), Peter Litherland (1791), Edward Massey (1800), and its modern ("table roller") form was developed by George Savage in the early 1800s. [...] Since about 1900 virtually every mechanical <b>watch,</b> <b>alarm</b> clock and other portable timepiece has used the {{lever escapement}}.|$|R
50|$|Across Bhutan, {{traditional}} {{farmers and}} grazers {{have continued to}} face human-wildlife conflicts such as crop and livestock depredation. These conflicts are complicated by problems of overgrazing and wildlife protection. Protected wildlife have entered agricultural areas, trampling crops and killing livestock. In response, the government has implemented an insurance scheme, begun constructing solar powered <b>alarm</b> fences, <b>watch</b> towers, search lights, and has provided fodder and salt licks outside human settlement areas to encourage animals to stay away. Some local farmers have begun planting crops of molasses grass {{in an effort to}} repel primates naturally. Bhutan has also sought assistance from the United Nations Development Programme in combatting crop and livestock losses.|$|R

50|$|A time bomb's timing {{mechanism}} may be professionally manufactured, either separately or {{as part of}} the device, or it may be improvised from an ordinary household timer such as a wind-up <b>alarm</b> clock, wrist <b>watch,</b> digital kitchen timer, or notebook computer. The timer can be programmed to count up or count down (usually the latter; as the bomb detonates when the time runs out).|$|R

It can send and receive SMS messages, but has no multimedia functionality.|$|R
60|$|At {{half past}} three the baggage was sent forward and the {{headquarter}} staff and Rifle Brigade followed it. There was no further check. The 42d and several companies of the Rifle Brigade entered Coomassie without another shot being fired in its defense. Sir Garnet Wolseley soon after arrived, and {{taking off his}} hat called for three cheers for the Queen, which was responded to with a heartiness and vigor which must have astonished the Ashantis. These were still in considerable numbers in the town, having been told by the king that peace was or would be made. They seemed in no way <b>alarmed,</b> but <b>watched,</b> as amused and interested spectators, {{the proceedings of the}} white troops.|$|R
50|$|Employers {{are using}} social {{networking}} sites like Facebook and LinkedIn to obtain additional information about job applicants. While these sites {{may be useful to}} verify resume information, profiles with pictures also may reveal much more information about the applicant, including issues pertaining to applicant weight and pregnancy. Some employers are also asking potential job candidates for their social media logins which has <b>alarmed</b> many privacy <b>watch</b> dogs and regulators.|$|R
50|$|Tronica (a.k.a. Ronica) was a {{trademark}} brand manufacturing handheld LCD games during the 80s.

50|$|In the 1900s, {{wristwatches}} {{were just}} starting to become fashionable. Schild Fréres, as the company was then known, started to produce ladies’ wristwatches adapted from small pocket watches. In 1905, the company {{changed its name to}} Eterna. The company continued to be at the leading edge of watch development, and in 1908 it patented the first <b>alarm</b> wristwatch. The <b>watch</b> went into production in 1914 and was launched at the Swiss National Exhibition in Berne that year.|$|R
5000|$|The {{balance spring}} {{is a fine}} spiral or helical torsion spring used in {{mechanical}} <b>watches,</b> <b>alarm</b> clocks, kitchen timers, marine chronometers, and other timekeeping mechanisms to control the rate of oscillation of the balance wheel. The balance spring is an essential adjunct to the balance wheel, causing it to oscillate back and forth. The balance spring and balance wheel together form a harmonic oscillator, which oscillates with a precise period or [...] "beat" [...] resisting external disturbances, and is responsible for timekeeping accuracy.|$|R
5000|$|At {{about the}} same time Odo departed, Benjamin Sisko goes to a conference on Bajor, and orders Miles O'Brien to have the gravity fixed on the USS Defiant before his return. Sisko is unconcerned that O'Brien lacks the one crucial piece of {{equipment}} required to make the repair. Nog offers to help O'Brien by navigating [...] "the Great Material Continuum", a Ferengi concept of economics and trade - described as [...] "millions of worlds, all with too much of one and not enough of the other." [...] O'Brien reluctantly gives Nog his authorization code, which Nog uses to make a long series of trades based on rumors, including loaning out Sisko's desk and selling General Martok's prized bloodwine. An increasingly <b>alarmed</b> O'Brien <b>watches</b> with dismay as the young Ferengi works deal after deal; meanwhile, the part he requires appears no closer to arriving.|$|R
50|$|V. G. Panneerdas was {{the founder}} of VGP Group of Companies. His story {{is one of the}} rags to riches. He started as a poor Christian man from a remote village called Azhagappa puram near Valliyur in Tamil Nadu, India in the Tirunelveli District. This is often {{confused}} {{by a lot of people}} with another village of the same name near Nagercoil in the Kanyakumari District. He moved to Chennai in search of opportunities. In 1955, he opened a shop selling items such as <b>alarm</b> clocks, <b>watches</b> and wall clocks. He was the pioneer in South India to introduce Hire Purchase for everyday goods. He built the VGP company from virtually nothing to its present status as a group of companies including retail, real estate and property development, resorts and amusement parks (including VGP Universal Kingdom), and video and audio studios.|$|R
