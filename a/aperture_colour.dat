40|$|Context. Analysis of bulges to redshifts {{of up to}} z ∼ 1 have {{provided}} ambiguous results as to whether bulges as a class are old structures akin to elliptical galaxies or younger products {{of the evolution of}} their host disks. Aims. We aim to define a sample of intermediate-z disk galaxies harbouring central bulges, and a complementary sample of disk galaxies without measurable bulges. We intend to provide colour profiles for both samples, as well as measurements of nuclear, disk, and global colours, which may be used to constrain the relative ages of bulges and disks. Methods. We select a diameter-limited sample of galaxies in images from the HST/WFPC 2 (Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 at the Hubble Space Telescope) Groth Strip survey, which is divided into two subsamples of higher and lower inclination to assess the role of dust in the measures quantities. Mergers are visually identified and excluded. We take special care to control the pollution by ellipticals. The bulge sample is defined with a criterion based on nuclear surface brightness excess over the inward extrapolation of the exponential law fitted to the outer regions of the galaxies. We extract colour profiles on the semi-minor axis least affected by dust in the disk, and measure nuclear colours at 0. 85 kpc from the centre over those profiles. Disk colours are measured on major axis profiles; global colours are obtained from 2. 6 ′′diameter <b>apertures.</b> <b>Colour</b> transformations and K-corrections are calculated usin...|$|R
40|$|Article {{can also}} be found at: [URL] CIE Technical Committee 1 - 34, Testing Colour-Appearance Models, was formed to {{investigate}} the performance of models based on their ability to predict the colour appearance of surface colours in simple and complex scenes under various illumination conditions. The work of this committee is limited only {{to the study of the}} colour appearance of surface colours and does not include the appearance of self-luminous <b>colours,</b> <b>aperture</b> <b>colours,</b> or comparison between different media or modes of appearance. This limitation has been imposed to find the best methods for predicting the colour appearance of objects while leaving complexities such as the cognitive interpretation of coloured stimuli for future work. The visual interpretation of non-object-colour stimuli is complex and ill-defined. The plan of work of TC 1 - 34 includes the analysis of colour appearance models using available data and the publication of these guidelines for coordinated research for additional testing of colour-appearance models. The purpose of these guidelines is to encourage researchers around the world to perform experiments that will provide useful data for evaluating the performance of colour appearance models. The guidelines are not intended to limit researchers to a prescribed experimental design, but rather to provide guidance regarding minimal data and viewing conditions that should be included in all experiments to provide useful intercomparison data. Experiments that reach beyond the minimal requirements outlined in these guidelines are certainly encouraged. These data might one day form the basis of a recommendation by the CIE for a color appearance space with broad applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{different}} algorithms {{appropriate for}} point source photometry {{on data from}} the SPIRE instrument on-board the Herschel Space Observatory, within the Herschel Interactive Processing Environment (HIPE) are compared. Point source photometry of a large ensemble of standard calibration stars and dark sky observations is carried out using the 4 major methods within HIPE: SUSSEXtractor, DAOphot, the SPIRE Timeline Fitter and simple <b>Aperture</b> Photometry. <b>Colour</b> corrections and effective beam areas {{as a function of}} the assumed source spectral index are also included to produce a large number of photometric measurements per individual target, in each of the 3 SPIRE bands (250, 350, 500 um), to examine both the accuracy and repeatability of each of the 4 algorithms. It is concluded that for flux densities down to the level of 30 mJy that the SPIRE Timeline Fitter is the method of choice. However, at least in the 250 and 350 um bands, all 4 methods provide photometric repeatability better than a few percent down to at approximately 100 mJy. The DAOphot method appears in many cases to have a systematic offset of ~ 8 % in all SPIRE bands which may be indicative of a sub-optimal aperture correction. In general, aperture photometry is the least reliable method, i. e. largest scatter between observations, especially in the longest wavelength band. At the faintest fluxes, < 30 mJy, SUSSEXtractor or DAOphot provide a better alternative to the Timeline Fitter. Comment: 19 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in Experimental Astronom...|$|R

40|$|The colour-magnitude {{relation}} (CMR) of cluster ellipticals {{has been}} widely used to constrain their star formation histories (SFHs) and to discriminate between the monolithic and merger paradigms of elliptical galaxy formation. We investigate the elliptical CMR predicted in the merger paradigm by using a LCDM hierarchical merger model. We first highlight sections of the literature which indicate that the traditional use of fixed <b>apertures</b> to derive <b>colours</b> gives a distorted view of the CMR due {{to the presence of}} colour gradients in galaxies. Fixed aperture observations make the CMR steeper and tighter than it really is. We then show that the star formation history (SFH) of cluster ellipticals predicted by the model is quasi-monolithic, with over 95 percent of the total stellar mass formed before a redshift of 1. The quasi-monolithic SFH produces a predicted CMR that agrees well at all redshifts with its observed counterpart once the fixed aperture effect is removed. More importantly, we present arguments to show that the elliptical-only CMR can be used to constrain the SFHs of present-day cluster ellipticals only if we believe a priori in the monolithic collapse model. It is not a meaningful tool for constraining the SFH in the merger paradigm, because a progressively larger fraction of the progenitor set of present-day cluster ellipticals is contained in late-type star forming systems at higher redshift, which cannot be ignored when deriving the SFHs. Hence, the elliptical-only CMR is not a useful discriminant between the two competing theories of elliptical galaxy evolution. Comment: replaced with accepted versio...|$|R
40|$|The {{two-dimensional}} {{temperature distribution}} {{in a highly}} structured sunspot and in two small umbrae is determined from a three-colour photometry in narrow spectral continua. Disturbing influences from the earth 9 ̆ 2 s atmosphere are removed by speckle masking techniques, yielding a spatial resolution limited by the telescope 9 ̆ 2 s <b>aperture.</b> The corresponding <b>colour</b> temperatures are consistent over a range of more than 2000 K, although the numerical correction introduced by the reconstruction differs largely for the three colours. Part of the scatter in the temperature relation disappears when convoluting the final images with artificial PSFs that compensate for the different, colour dependent spatial resolution. The remaining spread in the scatter plots does not reflect noise, but is related to local variations of the temperature difference between the continuum emitting layers. This is most obvious for a small umbra which yields 9 ̆ 1 branches 9 ̆ 2 in the scatter plots the 9 ̆ 1 bluer 9 ̆ 2 of which corresponding to the limb-side umbral border. Here, the 9 ̆ 1 hot rim 9 ̆ 2 of a Wilson depressed umbra becomes visible. The temperature map of the large spot shows that the bright umbral dots do not reach {{the temperature of the}} non-spot surroundings. Instead, they exceed the 2000 K cooler umbral temperature minimum by 900 - 1300 K. The filamentary structure of the surrounding penumbra has spatial temperature fluctuations of typically 700 K, a value which fits earlier observed ontrasts. However, the mean temperatures of 5650 K in the dark and 6250 K in the bright penumbral fine structures exceed former findings. Exceptionally bright penumbral grains are 250 K than the mean solar surface and thus exceed even brightest granules...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of the human anterior intraparietal area and the dorsal premotor cortex to arbitrary visuo-motor mapping during grasping were tested. Trained right-handed subjects reached for and pincer-grasped a cube with the right hand {{in the absence of}} visual feedback after the cube location had been displayed for 200 ms. During the reaching movements, the colour of the cube changed and visual feedback about the change of colour was provided for 100 ms at 500 ms after movement onset (at the time of peak grasp <b>aperture).</b> Depending on <b>colour,</b> subjects were instructed to either pincer-grasp the cube in a horizontal or vertical grasp position with the latter necessitating wrist rotation (experiment 1) or to pincer-grasp and transport the cube to either a left or right target position (experiment 2). Within two consecutive 200 ms time windows (TMS 1 and 2) starting 500 ms and 700 ms after movement onset, respectively, double pulses of supra-threshold transcranial magnetic stimulation (inter-stimulus interval: 100 ms) were delivered over (i) the left primary motor cortex (90 degrees vertically angulated coil position, control stimulation), (ii) the left dorsal premotor cortex or (ii) the left anterior intraparietal area. Compared to control stimulation, stimulation of the anterior intraparietal area, but not of the dorsal premotor cortex, at TMS 1 delayed the times to wrist rotation (experiment 1) and hand transport (experiment 2). Compared to control stimulation, stimulation of the dorsal premotor cortex, but not of the anterior intraparietal area, at TMS 2 delayed both wrist rotation (experiment 1) and hand transport (experiment 2). We contend that the anterior intraparietal area and the dorsal premotor cortex are both involved albeit at different phases during the mapping of arbitrary visual cues with goal directed grasp and transport movements. These data add to the current understanding of how human cortical areas work in concert during manual activities...|$|R

Selective imaging [...] 4. Observing {{with the}} Macquarie University Selective Imaging Camera [...] 5. Processing of MUSIC images [...] 6. Analysis of stellar images [...] 7. Analysis of {{planetary}} images [...] 8. Conclusions. An extensive empirical {{study of the}} frame selection method of high-resolution astronomical imaging, also known as lucky imaging, has been carried out. This method involves the capture of many {{hundreds or thousands of}} short exposure frames, the scanning and ranking of all the frames for sharpness, and the co-alignment and averaging of only the best frames into a final image. The performance of the selective imaging technique was tested by imaging several bright stars, binaries and clusters, and using the brightest pixel value in each frame as the sharpness metric. The lucky imaging parameters are the frame exposure time, telescope aperture, seeing, frame selection fraction, colour band, and distance from the co-alignment position. By using a range of <b>aperture</b> masks and <b>colour</b> filters, and a camera with adjustable exposure, we explored the widest range of parameter space of any frame selection study to date. [...] The results from the stellar images show that frame selection is very effective at reducing the effects of atmospheric turbulence on astronomical images. When all frames in an observation are combined, the seeing disc is diminished and a bright central core is apparent. By selecting just the best 1 % of frames the core is brighter while the halo almost vanishes. In many of these cases faint spikes and dark rings appeared, indicating difraction limited images. The results were best when small apertures were used, particularly at longer wavelengths. It was found that, for the Siding Spring site, the exposure time should be limited to 10 ms, although images were improved at all times tested. It was also found that when image frames of binaries and clusters were co-aligned on the brightest star, the improvement in sharpness was greatest at this point, and the improvement decreased with angular radius. [...] To prepare for future research, solar system planets and lunar features were also imaged. These were processed with sharpness metrics suited to extended objects. It was found that frame selection was effective at improving the planetary images over traditional long exposure images. However the results were not as good as for the stellar images. Possible reasons for this are discussed. Mode of access: World Wide Web. xviii, 137 p. ill. (some col. ...|$|R
