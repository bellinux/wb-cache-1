40|$|In the {{discipline}} of International Relations, scholars have recently drawn attention to how political actors use narratives <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>legitimacy</b> for themselves, their actions, and their use of force. Whilst such work provides welcome insights, {{there has been little}} attention given to how these narratives are often told through visual media on digital social media sites. In light of this, this thesis argues that visual media are central to how political actors <b>claim</b> <b>legitimacy</b> for {{the use of force in}} the digital age. Theoretically informed by work on aesthetics, narrative, and visual global politics, this thesis provides an analytical framework for studying the visual politics of legitimation. This is then explored through two case studies of the British Army and the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces. In each case study I draw upon multiple methods to analyse the narrative and visual content of each actor’s official Facebook Page, as well as the contexts of media production and audience reception. This thesis contributes to studies of global politics by illustrating how each actor uses visual media <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>legitimacy</b> for the use of force, and thereby provides the first empirical analysis of the visual politics of legitimation...|$|R

The Vietnam Communist Party bases its <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> political <b>legitimacy</b> on multiple sources. The bauxite mining controversy challenged the state’s <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> political <b>legitimacy</b> on the basis of performance.

40|$|In {{this policy}} brief, Judge Robert Sharpe of the Court of Appeal for Ontario {{argues that it}} would be wrong for judges exercising the power of {{judicial}} review <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>legitimacy</b> as representatives. He argues that the claim is not only wrong, it is dangerous as it distorts the nature of the judicial function. Judicial review of legislation against constitutionally mandated standards can only be defended for what it is: independent judges acting as impartial adjudicators applying legal method and argument. If judges deceive themselves into thinking they are representative and fail consciously to relatethe exercise of the power of judicial review to their non-representational role, they are likely to exceed acceptable limits of judicial authority. The legitimacy of judicial review rests on the perception that courts are not representative of anybody or anything other than the law and act as independent and impartial arbiters who base their decisions on legal argument and reasoning rather than on political judgment. </p...|$|R
40|$|The discursive {{framing of}} {{projects}} is an oft-used strategy <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>legitimacy</b> and create support for proposed measures. By giving a project an appealing ‘label’, politicians {{and policy makers}} try to prevent criticism. However, policy labels are thrown out like ‘boomerangs’ {{with a view to}} gaining leverage, resources, and legitimacy. The thrower, however, cannot control how the boomerang comes back. This paper sheds light on the consequences of these ‘backfiring labels’ with the help of two illustrative case studies: a ‘calamity polder’ for controlled flood storage (Ooijpolder) and a ‘bypass’ for the river IJssel near Kampen, respectively. Interestingly, the wider frames from which these labels originate differ and give rise to different dynamics, but with the same outcome: the label reaped the opposite effect. We analyze the way in which this process of strategic ‘labelling’ takes place, its discursive power, its impact on the governance process in question, and how policy makers react upon backfiring consequences...|$|R

Nationalism uses archaeology and the imagery of the ancient world <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>legitimacy</b> in the modern world.

Less articulated in the literature is the role of focus groups as an anticipatory methodology, as a tool to research public responses in-the-making.

In this chapter, I examine the use of focus groups as an anticipatory or ‘upstream’ method in public perception research on new science and technology.

In response to these attacks, AMORC published material calling Clymer's ideas [...] "some of the weirdest notions that a human mind ever harboured," [...] further pointing out that his positions were [...] "self-appointed and self-devised."

Crowley initially responded by offering to help Lewis fight Clymer, though Crowley's later attempt claim control of Lewis's AMORC, resulting in a rift between them.|$|R
40|$|This thesis uses a {{framework}} of contextualised critical hydropolitics with reference to political ecology and environmental justice in order to investigate different framings of water resources management practices in the Sesan transboundary river basin. The study applies an ethnographic approach to observe and assess how participation and integration are conceptualised and manifested {{in the form of}} debates and discussions at public meetings and other contexts. The result of the empirical research shows that integration and participation are framed and interpreted in various ways, shifting from a critique and challenge to existing ways of doing things toward an appropriation of progressive discourse by more powerful actors <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>legitimacy</b> and maintain authority in water governance. The case of IWRM-led planning in the Mekong and Sesan demonstrates how integration and participation become programmatic- the circumstances that the voices of the dam-affected people and their concerns are programmatised and grassroots grievances and responses to the impacts of Sesan dams relevant to transboundary governance are downplayed and depoliticised. As a result, the involvement of the dam-affected people in water resources management continues to be short-changed and they are generally left out of the Sesan decision-making process. In the case of Sesan advocacy, as demonstrated by grassroots movements such as the 3 SPN, integration and participation are framed in terms of what may be termed a ‘justice-orientation’ to transboundary governance which has greater significance in bringing about justice for the dam-affected people. The thesis concludes that the social framings of Sesan transboundary impacts through a discourse of integration and participation are devices for hegemonic actors such as development bank agents and water managers <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> their <b>legitimacy</b> in Sesan water resources management and impose their views of governance on other actors...|$|R
