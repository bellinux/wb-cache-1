Unlike previous iterations that used dashes between the sections, the new system only puts a dash between the Interfix and Lot Sequence numbers. Lot codes are between 13 and 16 symbols long.|$|E

If different ammunition types are mixed (as when ball and tracer ammunition are linked into a machinegun belt) and they originally had separate lot numbers, they must have all the <b>ammunition</b> <b>lot</b> numbers marked on the packaging.

50|$|Until 1938, all M91 {{rifles and}} {{carbines}} were chambered for the rimless 6.5×52mm Modello 1895 cartridge, using a round-nose metal case bullet of 160 grains weight at approximately 2,000-2,400 ft/s muzzle velocity, depending upon barrel length. At least one small arms authority noted inconsistencies in powder types in arsenal-loaded 6.5×52mm military ammunition, often with different powder types and <b>ammunition</b> <b>lots</b> intermixed {{within a single}} clip of ammunition. The practice of intermixing powder types and <b>ammunition</b> <b>lots</b> in clipped rifle ammunition was generally avoided by arsenals of other nations, as it generally resulted in varying bullet velocities and excessive bullet dispersion on the target.|$|R

Information published on acceptance tests regarding five MK 316 MOD 0 cartridge production lots indicated a sub 2.4 in at 300 yd performance.

50|$|Presented Cd {{data can}} not be simply used for every gun-ammunition combination, since it was {{measured}} for the barrels, rotational (spin) velocities and <b>ammunition</b> <b>lots</b> the Lapua testers used during their test firings. Variables like differences in rifling (number of grooves, depth, width and other dimensional properties), twist rates and/or muzzle velocities impart different rotational (spin) velocities and rifling marks on projectiles. Changes in such variables and projectile production lot variations can yield different downrange interaction with the air the projectile passes through that can result in (minor) changes in flight behavior. This particular field of external ballistics is currently (2009) not elaborately studied nor well understood.|$|R

The firings {{were conducted on}} 2 February 1979 utilizing the A- 10 /GAU- 8 weapon system and ammunition from LAVP Lot Number OL 78 D- 43 - 016. Targets for the firings were 31 US M- 47 tanks arranged in a static formation to simulate a Soviet MBT Battalion of three ten (10) tank companies and a battalion commander tank. Also included in the target array were four plywood mock-ups, simulating the tank battalion's ZSU- 23 / 4 anti-aircraft defense. Five A- 10 pilots conducted firing passes at the formation of M- 47 target tanks and ZSU- 23 / 4 mock-ups. Normal A- 10 operational tactics for low altitude, low dive angle attacks were followed. This publication contains {{a description of the}} firing conditions, A- 10 attack parameters, weapons effects derived from the firings, and individual damage assessments for each target tank in the array. The data collected from this test verify the acceptability of the <b>ammunition</b> <b>lot</b> tested, and the effectiveness of the A- 10 /GAU- 8 weapon system as one capable of inflicting catastrophic (K), mobility (M), and firepower (F) kills against modern main battle tanks.

Most ammunition is produced long before its ultimate consumption {{and stored in}} a series of different depots for a considerably long period of time. During storage, the quality of the ammunition stockpile deteriorates proportionally to the conditions of depots. We view different conditions associated with a series of depots as step-stress. A random effects logistic regression model is employed to predict the quality of ammunition stockpile in terms of the routing information such as a series of location and duration of storage of <b>ammunition</b> <b>lots.</b> The resultant prediction model can be used to determine the appropriate time for reorder or renovation of ammunition before the quality reaches substandard. An example is given to illustrate the implementation procedure of the prediction model suggested in this paper. Naval Surface Warfare Center[URL]...|$|R

In 1942 the square flake shaped double-base propellant was replaced by tubular shaped double-base propellant. Further there were minor developments regarding the projectiles, sealing and primers. GP 11 cartridges were mass-produced for the Swiss military in the ammunition factories in Altdorf and in Thun until 1994. The last 1994 produced <b>ammunition</b> had <b>Lot</b> No. 349-94.

40|$|Lot {{numbers are}} marks that {{are applied to}} {{ammunition}} {{at the point of}} manu-facture, assembly, or modification. They identify a quantity of ammunition that has been assembled from uniform components and under similar condi-tions. These marks are applied to facilitate accounting and general manage-ment of ammunition. Marks may be applied on ammunition components themselves and/or on the packaging of the ammunition. Small arms <b>ammunition</b> is rarely <b>lot</b> marked on the ammunition itself, such as on the cartridge case. This chapter argues that applying lot marks di-rectly to small arms cartridges offers some security forces the prospect of in-creased logistical efficiency.

40|$|Abstract: Three-dimensional {{visco-elastic}} lame deformation incremental {{constitutive equation}} is derived based on Total Lagrangian method, and structural dynamical response {{distribution in the}} grain during launching is simulated numerically by finite element method under high load condition for projectile-based equipment, the equivalent stress {{in the bottom of}} load-relieving structure and the Y-displacement in the top of load-relieving structure are calculated. The results show that the stress is ameliorated after the function of load-relieving subassembly, and it can decrease impact. Also Y-displacement is accord with limit request, and when reaching the maximum, the transmutation will be comeback. With the development and extensive application of the information technology, various countries step up the manufacture of the new-type ammunition, a batch of new-type ammunition has appeared, such as TV Recon Projectile, TV Terminal Guided Projectile, Floating Interfere Projectile and so on. The configuration of new-type <b>ammunition</b> is a <b>lot</b> more complicated than the routine ammunition, and there are accurate electronic devices and all kinds of photoelectric sensors in projectile-based device, such as guided head, optical device, TV reconnaissance device and all kinds of sensor and so on.

5000|$|The federal {{government}} purchased 2040.207 acre from the Hayden family in December 1940 {{for the purpose}} of building an ordnance (ammunition) plant, to be named The Denver Ordnance Plant (DOP). The site was chosen for its rural setting; because it was far from the nation's borders, it was presumed safer than coastal areas from enemy sabotage or attack. In late January 1941, the War Department signed a contract with the Remington Arms Company to produce small arms ammunition. Construction of the Plant started in early March 1941. Rapidly, the Government built over 200 buildings for the new Denver Ordnance complex, and ammunition production commenced in late September 1941. Denver Ordnance soon became known for the high quality and accuracy of its <b>ammunition,</b> particularly its <b>lots</b> of [...]30-06 Springfield rifle ammunition known as M2 ball, which were highly prized by snipers and other rifle marksmen in the U.S. Army. [...] At the height of production in 1943, the Denver Ordnance Plant was the 4th largest “city” in Colorado with a workforce “population” of more than 22,000. These employees worked day and night, producing over six million cartridges a day.|$|R
