[...] Usher explained that the album's lyrics also reflect on what has been going on with his relationship; 8701 is predominantly an R album. [...] "Can U Help Me", is about a deep relationship to which Usher experienced. [...] "U Don't Have to Call" [...] is a hip-hop song inspired by Jackson, while [...] "U Got It Bad" [...] is an R slow-jam. About [...] "U Got It Bad", Kyle Anderson of MTV wrote that it makes use of the acoustic guitar and a [...] "slow-burning bassline" [...] throughout. The album's lead single [...] "U Remind Me" [...] is also an R track, and its lyrics is based on meeting a woman who reminds Usher of an ex-girlfriend, and therefore cannot date her.|$|E

Speaking for the defence, he reminded the jury {{that every one of}} the doctors speaking on Lamb's behalf had originally been engaged by the state and that Yaworsky was the only one not employed in the public sector. He conceded that the defendant's actions were senseless and violent, but stressed that if found {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity, Lamb would stay in custody and could be kept in psychiatric care for the rest of his life if necessary. He argued that Lamb's actions on the evening of 25 June 1966 clearly made no sense and asked the jury to carefully consider them: the victims were not known to Lamb; Lamb made no attempt to disguise himself; Lamb acted alone; Lamb had nothing to gain from the act; Lamb inexplicably diverted his fire from the original group to a shadow in a doorway; Lamb then chose another house at random and threatened to kill the occupant, then left without doing anything; Lamb made no attempt to hide the weapon, leaving it in a nearby field where it would surely be found; then, finally, the boy simply went home to bed as if nothing had happened.

This followed the May 2008 reporting of the cover image on Wikipedia by U.S.-based social conservative site WorldNetDaily to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A subsequent investigation by the FBI concluded that the artwork did not violate any US laws. An officer of the Concerned Women for America, a conservative Christian advocacy group, commented, [...] "By allowing that image to remain posted, Wikipedia is helping to further facilitate perversion and paedophilia". EContent magazine subsequently reported that the discussion page associated with the article declared [...] "Prior discussion has determined by broad consensus that the Virgin Killer cover will not be removed", and asserted that Wikipedia contributors [...] "favour inclusion {{in all but the}} most extreme cases". However, according to The Guardian because [...] "the IWF doesn't talk to people outside of the UK they weren't able to <b>appreciate</b> <b>what</b> was going on". Internet security expert Richard Clayton explained that [...] "We see this borderline stuff all the time; it's a no-win", before adding that the decision seems to have been based on taking the image out of context, particularly [...] "given that you can go into HMV and buy a copy on the high street".

2500|$|Three {{different}} {{covers for}} Game Informers first {{preview of the}} game for its October 2010 issue were collaborations between Irrational and the magazine, envisioning what a video game magazine would be like in the early 20th century. Each cover, drawn by Irrational's Rob Waters, is inspired by the cover artwork from The Saturday Evening Post and includes fictional advertisements based on early 20th century variants, including one redrawn from a public domain ad. Kevin Gifford of Gamasutra praised these covers, commented that such a diversion for a game magazine cover represents a paradigm change, in that [...] "developers are beginning to <b>appreciate</b> <b>what</b> magazines can do for their media strategy that online can't", and that because Game Informer does need to vie for space at newsstands, is able to take more creative approaches with such covers as opposed to cover layers designed to gain maximum exposure. Similarly, in its reveal of the first images of the player protagonist Booker, Electronic Games Monthly used a cover in homage to the Uncanny X-Men comic, Days of Future Past, another story dealing with alternate realities.|$|E

It was lip-synched by an effeminate drug dealer played by Dean Stockwell, after which Booth demanded the song be played over and over, once beating the protagonist while the song played. During filming, Lynch asked for the song to be played repeatedly to give the set a surreal atmosphere. Orbison was initially shocked at its use: he saw the film in a theater in Malibu and later said, [...] "I was mortified because {{they were talking about}} the 'candy-colored clown' in relation to a dope deal...

[...] Neon Limelight wrote, [...] "The upbeat song is really less about her career and more about where she is now in her life and her [...] ability to <b>appreciate</b> <b>what</b> really matters." [...] Hardeep Phull of the New York Post gave the song three stars, saying: [...] "this is the euphoric sound of her (Clarkson) looking to the future.

[...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV News also added, [...] "Kelly Clarkson is still pop's sassy [...] "Miss Independent", but these days, she's a bit more willing to ask for help.

[...] Clayborne early on debates Saxifrage Russell over the proper role of humanity on Mars and though initially apolitical, this stance marks her as the original [...] "Red," [...] while Russell's hands-on terraforming reflects the antithesis of these views. [...] Clayborne is shown to prefer solitude during much of the series, and even her relationship with fellow First Hundred settler Simon (with whom she has a child) is subject to introspective silence in most cases. [...] Simon's death and the estrangement she finds from their son Peter when the latter emerges as a leading moderate [...] "green" [...] drive her to further isolation. [...] Clayborne's relationship with Russell is shown to be complex, the two of them taking early opposite views but the situation slowly changing as Russell comes to <b>appreciate</b> <b>what</b> has been unleashed and what has indeed been lost as science gives way to commercial exploitation that he cannot control. [...] During the events of Blue Mars, Russell intervenes to save Clayborne's life; later, the two are revealed to have once shared an attraction that went astray because of a casual misinterpretation between them. Ann undergoes a drastic change towards Blue Mars due to the emergence of something inside of her which she describes as anti-Ann and something else which she can't quite describe.|$|E
2500|$|The {{season was}} not without confrontation, as O'Neal in one team meeting said, [...] "I have {{something}} to say. I think Kobe is playing too selfishly for us to win." [...] O'Neal felt pressure to be leader of the team and was upset with Bryant's shot selection. Teammate Ron Harper helped mediate the differences between O'Neal and Bryant. According to Jackson, [...] "Kobe didn't have a selfish agenda; he just felt that {{the way he had}} been playing was the best way he could contribute. Gradually, he's seen there is a different way to contribute that incorporates more of the team." [...] Upon arriving to the Lakers that season, Winter said he was stunned to discover the level of hatred O'Neal expressed toward Bryant. [...] "There was a lot of hatred in [...] heart ... Kobe just took it and kept going." [...] O'Neal regularly expressed to management that he did not believe the team could win a championship with Bryant. Winter observed that O'Neal influenced the entire team against Bryant. Winter thought that Bryant {{made it a point to}} get the ball to O'Neal that year, but O'Neal did not <b>appreciate</b> <b>what</b> Bryant was doing to help him. During that season's All-Star Game, Bryant did not participate in the Slam Dunk Contest and a matchup against Vince Carter, following Jackson's request to pass on individual accomplishments to keep the focus on the team. During All-Star warm-ups, O'Neal mimicked Bryant's crossover dribble but threw the ball into the stands to accentuate Bryant's turnovers. O'Neal said it was an inside joke between Kobe and him. Jackson and Winter relied on the triangle offense to heal the relationship between O'Neal and Bryant. The coaches believed that the offense was so structured that the relationship between the two players would be smoother on the court. The coaches would also tell the team they did not see the selfishness in Bryant that the players saw. Winter even put together a video for O'Neal to show that Bryant was playing his role correctly.|$|E
2500|$|Critics' {{reviews of}} From the Sky Down were mixed. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an {{enthusiastic}} review, describing it as [...] "one {{of the most}} transcendent close-up looks at {{the process of creating}} rock & roll I've ever seen." [...] In his opinion, the film was a [...] "stirring testament to what it really means when four people in this world can create magical things because they band together." [...] Hank Steuver of The Washington Post called it an [...] "intriguing" [...] documentary that [...] "becomes a revealing and even enlightening meditation on the mystery of why some bands stay together and some don't." [...] The reviewer said the film is [...] "refreshingly blunt and beautifully assembled" [...] and praised Guggenheim for asking the band tough questions about that period in their history. Brad Wheeler of The Globe and Mail gave the film a three-out-of-four star rating, calling it an [...] "essential companion piece" [...] to the reissue of Achtung Baby. Wheeler wrote that [...] "the process of U2 dreaming itself a new fashion while struggling to get its joy back is tightly and adroitly explored". Radio broadcaster Alan Cross wrote that the viewer will [...] "come out with a new appreciation of {{what it takes to be}} U2". Cross enjoyed the scenes in which the band revisit old DAT tapes demonstrating the evolution of the songs [...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] and [...] "One", along with the animated scenes. Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that the documentary is not a [...] "complete record" [...] of Achtung Babys conception, but that it [...] "offers fans a rare glimpse at the process behind U2's music, and for non-fans, it attempts to set a context in which they can <b>appreciate</b> <b>what</b> it is that U2 accomplished". Like other reviewers, he highlighted the scene in which the band revisits the recording of [...] "One" [...] as one of the film's most important. McWeeny ended his review by saying, [...] "This may not be everything I wanted from the movie, but it's solid, and the glimpse we get of real creative alchemy is impressive, indeed." ...|$|E
