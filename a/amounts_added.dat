The determination is very fast due to the short time of analysis: the peaks of the matrix, the internal standard and DEHP appear within 5 minutes.

40|$|N-nitrosamines {{are meant}} to be {{probable}} or possible carcinogenic components, possibly formed out of a reaction between nitrite and N-containing substances such as amino acids and secondary amines. Nitrite is often used for processing meat products because of its colouring and antimicrobial properties. During this experimental setup, the influence of proline, hydroxyproline or pyrrolidine on N-nitrosamine formation in meat samples was evaluated. The N-nitrosamines concentrations were measured with gas chromatography-thermal energy analyzer. Only the concentrations of N-nitrosodimethylamine and N-nitrosopyrrolidine were found above the limit of detection in a number of tested experimental conditions. The concentration of these two N-nitrosamines was modelled as a function of temperature and nitrite concentration for different situations (presence or absence of added natural N-containing meat components). It could be concluded that proline and pyrrolidine promoted the formation of N-nitrosopyrrolidine. It could also be confirmed that the higher the temperature of the meat processing procedure and the higher the sodium nitrite <b>amounts</b> <b>added,</b> the higher were the yields of the respective N-nitrosamines. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{directed}} acyclic {{network with}} nonnegative integer arc lengths is called balanced if any two paths with common endpoints have equal lengths. In the buffer assignment problem such a network is given, {{and the goal}} is to balance it by increasing arc lengths by integer amounts (called buffers), so that the sum of the <b>amounts</b> <b>added</b> is minimal. This problem arises in VLSI design, and was recently shown to be polynomial for rooted networks. Here we give simple procedures which solve several generalizations of this problem in strongly polynomial time, using ideas from network flow theory. In particular, we solve a weighted version of the problem, extend the results to nonrooted networks, and allow upper bounds on buffers. We also give a strongly polynomial algorithm for solving the min-max buffer assignment problem, based on a strong proximity result between fractional and integer balanced solutions. Finally, we show that the problem of balancing a network while minimizing the number of arcs with positive buffers is NP-hard...|$|E

40|$|In the enzymatic {{hydrolysis}} and synthesis of proteins in vitro, the important factor, the factor {{upon which the}} direction {{and the degree of}} the reaction are dependent, is not the relative concentration of water, but the concentration of material in solution. This conclusion, pointed out by Moore, the authors have discussed at length in a previous paper (1). As shown there, the molecular concentration of water is always so enormously greater than that of the other components that the small <b>amounts</b> <b>added</b> or removed in the course of either reaction are negligible, and it may, therefore, be considered as remaining constant. The distinguishing feature of the hydrolysis and synthesis of protein is the conversion of 1 molecule of protein into a number of molecules of products. It is this characteristic which is responsible for complete hydrolysis in dilute solutions and for the ease with which synthesis is achieved in concentrated solutions. It follows that the extent of synthesis will increase as the concentration increases, and that as the concentration decreases a point will be reached at which synthesis will fail. The concentration at this point will correspond to the maximum concentration of protein capable of complete hydrolysis...|$|E

After treatment with 0. 1, 0. 5 or 1. 0 mg fenvalerate g(- 1) soil in three soils and incubation for a 40 -day period, the changes in diversity were monitored by two different methods. The cultivable heterotrophic diversity was investigated by colony morphology on solid LB medium. Genetic diversity was measured as bands on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) gels by total genomic DNA extraction and purification, PCR-amplification of bacterial 16 S rDNA fragments. The Shannon-Wiener index of diversity (H), richness (S) and evenness (EH) were used to measure changes in the bacterial community in the soils.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Methanol (CH 3 OH) is {{believed}} to be teratogenic based on rodent studies. The mouse is more sensitive than the rat, but mechanisms of toxicity and identification of teratogenic metabolites are uncertain. METHODS: Rat and mouse whole embryo cultures are used to distinguish toxicity of CH 3 OH and its metabolites, formaldehyde (HCHO) and formate (HCOONa), which are produced following transit through the visceral yolk sac (VYS), via addition to culture medium, or by direct embryonic exposure through microinjection into the amnion. RESULTS: Embryonic viability, increased dysmorphogenesis, and decreased growth parameters were altered in a dose-dependent fashion for each compound. Mouse embryos were more sensitive than rat, as indicated by significant decreases in viability at comparable, lower concentrations. HCHO produced dysmorphogenesis and caused embryolethality at nearly 1000 -fold lower concentrations (0. 004 mg/ml) than seen with either CH 3 OH or HCOONa. All agents produced incomplete axial rotation and delayed neural tube closure in mice, but only CH 3 OH elicited similar effects in the rat.

The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption, thermal gravimetric, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature programmed reduction, and temperature programmed oxidation. The synthesized mesoporous MnFe 2 O 4 microspheres composed of nanoparticles (10 - 30 nm) were 100 - 500 nm in diameter and had surface areas between 60. 2 and 86. 8 m(2) g(- 1), depending on the CH 3 COOK <b>amounts</b> <b>added</b> in the preparation. After calcined at 600 degrees C, MnFe 2 O 4 was decomposed to Mn 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3 mixture.

40|$|Numerous {{commercial}} products incorporate novel engineered nanomaterials such as gold, silica, zinc oxide, and fullerenes {{in complex}} matrices such as polymer composites, creams, and textiles. Analytical methods for detecting nanomaterials in complex matrices {{are not well}} developed. Moreover, nanomaterial content and properties of these commercial products are typically unknown and protected for proprietary reasons. This study had two primary aims: detection of C 60 within commercial face creams to establish a baseline concentration in these products (the first time this has been performed) and detection of residual C 60 reactivity remaining in the products aged in water under various light conditions with a view toward environmental exposure assessment. To achieve these aims, three commercial creams advertised as containing the fullerene nanomaterials were investigated using a range of analytical techniques. Among the detection methods tested, only extraction followed by high-performance liquid chromatography was able to detect fullerenes in these products. The measured quantities of C 60 in these creams represented < 0. 005 % (w/w) with an unknown yield because total <b>amounts</b> <b>added</b> to the creams were unknown. Production of reactive oxygen species from these face creams was measured after aging them in water as well as exposing them to solar spectrum illumination or ultraviolet light, or storage in the dark. Singlet oxygen generated in the products after 48 h of aging was correlated with the amounts of C 60 extracted from preaged samples, indicating residual photochemical reactivity and pointing toward the long-term impacts of utilizing these materials in commercial products. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc...|$|E
