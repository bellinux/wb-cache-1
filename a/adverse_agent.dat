We apply our model on the bioenergy industries. We compare {{the case of an}} ambiguity neutral agent with that of an ambiguity <b>adverse</b> <b>agent.</b> We show that the investment decision of an agent depends on the effects of both the capital investment and the level of production on the cost and the uncertainty the agent is confronted with. Moreover, we find that ambiguity aversion tends to decrease the agent's optimal levels of production and investment.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{volatility}} spillovers are {{large enough to}} matter to investors. We demonstrate that standard deviations of returns to mean-variance portfolios of European equities fall by 1 – 1. 5 % at daily, weekly, and monthly rebalancing horizons when volatility spillovers are included in covariance forecasts. We estimate the conditional second moment matrix of (synchronized) daily index returns for the London, Frankfurt and Paris stock markets via two asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation models (A-DCC) : the unrestricted model includes volatility spillovers and the restricted model does not. We combine covariance forecasts from the restricted and unrestricted models {{with a wide range}} of assumed returns relatives via a polar co-ordinates method, and compute out-of-sample realized portfolio returns and variances for testing. Diebold–Mariano tests confirm that most risk reductions are statistically significant. Stochastic dominance tests indicate that portfolios accounting for volatility spillover would be preferred by risk <b>adverse</b> <b>agents.</b> 22 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Cyclodextrins (CDs) can endow electrospun fibers with {{outstanding}} performance characteristics {{that rely on}} their ability to form inclusion complexes. The inclusion complexes can be blended with electrospinnable polymers or used themselves as main components of electrospun nanofibers. In general, the presence of CDs promotes drug release in aqueous media, but they may also play other roles such as protection of the drug against <b>adverse</b> <b>agents</b> during and after electrospinning, and retention of volatile fragrances or therapeutic agents to be slowly released to the environment. Moreover, fibers prepared with empty CDs appear particularly suitable for affinity separation. The interest for CD-containing nanofibers is exponentially increasing as the scope of applications is widening. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art on CD-containing electrospun mats. The information has been classified into three main sections: (i) fibers of mixtures of CDs and polymers, including polypseudorotaxanes and post-functionalization; (ii) fibers of polymer-free CDs; and (iii) fibers of CD-based polymers (namely, polycyclodextrins).

40|$|Several non-physiologic agents such as radiation, oxidants and alkylating agents induce ligand-independent {{activation}} of numerous receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and of protein tyrosine kinases at the inner {{side of the}} plasma membrane (e. g. Dévary et al., 1992; Sachsenmaier et al., 1994; Schieven et al., 1994; Coffer et al., 1995). Here we show additional evidence for the {{activation of}} epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and we show activation of v-ErbB, ErbB 2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. As a common principle of action the inducing agents such as UVC, UVB, UVA, hydrogen peroxide and iodoacetamide inhibit receptor tyrosine dephosphorylation in a thiol-sensitive and, {{with the exception of}} the SH-alkylating agent, reversible manner. EGFR dephosphorylation can also be modulated by these non-physiologic agents in isolated plasma membranes in the presence of Triton X- 100. Further, substrate (EGFR) and phosphatase have been separated: a membrane preparation of cells that have been treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and whose dephosphorylating enzymes have been permanently destroyed by iodoacetamide can be mixed with a membrane preparation from untreated cells which re-establishes EGFR dephosphorylation. This dephosphorylation can be modulated in vitro by UV and thiol agents. We conclude that RTKs exhibit significant spontaneous protein kinase activity; several <b>adverse</b> <b>agents</b> target (an) essential SH-group(s) carried by (a) membrane-bound protein tyrosine phosphatase(s) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn principle, {{liabilities}} combining both insurancial risks (e. g. mortality/longevity, crop yield, [...] .) {{and pure}} financial risks cannot be priced neither {{by applying the}} usual actuar- ial principles of diversification, nor by arbitrage-free replication arguments. Still, it has been often proposed in the literature to combine these two approaches by suggesting to hedge a pure financial payoff computed by taking the mean under the historical/objective probability measure {{on the part of}} the risk that can be diversified. Not surprisingly, simple examples show that this approach is typically inconsistent for risk <b>adverse</b> <b>agents.</b> We show that it can nevertheless be recovered asymptotically when the number of sold claims goes to infinity and the absolute risk aversion of the agent goes to zero simultaneously. This follows from a general convergence result on utility indifference prices which is valid for both complete and incomplete financial markets. In particular, if the underlying financial market is complete, the limit price corresponds to the hedging cost of the mean payoff. If the financial market is incomplete but the agent behaves asymptotically as an exponential utility maximizer with vanishing risk aversion, we show that the utility indifference price converges to the expectation of the discounted payoff under the minimal entropy martingale measure...|$|R

40|$|Twelve {{strains of}} Staphylococcus aureus {{isolated}} from patients and two collection strains were grown on membranes placed on agar containing subminimal inhibitory concentrations of oxacillin. Clusters of staphylococci {{held together by}} thick cross walls resulted. These organisms, {{as well as the}} same strains grown in the same way on drug-free medium (control), were eluted from the membranes and were incubated with human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) from various donors. Phagocytosis was comparable for both staphylococci exposed to oxacillin and control staphylococci, but the killing effect was different. The staphylococci grown on membranes in the presence of oxacillin were less susceptible to killing than the control staphylococci, but the killing effect was different. The staphylococci grown on membranes in the presence of oxacillin were less susceptible to killing than the control staphylococci. After 0. 5 and 1 h of incubation with PMNs, the killing rates for oxacillin-grown versus control staphylococci were 52 and 70 % and 65 and 85 %, respectively (P < 0. 01). After 2 and 3 h of incubation, the killing was similar. Most clusters of staphylococci contain a few individual cells that are located {{in the center of the}} cluster and are surrounded by other staphylococci; therefore, they are protected from <b>adverse</b> <b>agents</b> in the environment. This could explain why the phagocytized clusters are less susceptible than control staphylococci to the killing effect of PMNs during the first hour of incubation. Oxacillin does not penetrate into PMNs and in the absence of the drug the cross walls lyse, liberating the constituent staphylococci. This coincides with the increase in the percentage of cluster killing by PMNs after 2 and 3 h of incubation...|$|R

30|$|A {{growing number}} of models have been {{developed}} to consider the heterogeneity of the agents and interactions among them, such as Chiarella and Iori (2002), Chiarella et al. (2006), Chiarella et al. (2009), and Malek and Ezzeddine (2011). Chiarella and Iori (2002) show how the trading strategies of noise traders, fundamentalists and chartists {{have an effect on the}} price, bid-ask spreads, trading volume and volatility; Fundamentalists are agents who make trading decisions with a belief that an asset has its own intrinsic value (equilibrium price) at any point of time, whereas chartists use past price trends as basis for decisions with a belief that the history of the price changes is useful information for making meaningful predictions for the future price of the asset. They show that the presence of chartist plays a critical role in the volatility of price and trading volume, and investigate the correlation between them. Chiarella et al. (2009) set up the model with agents assumed to have three components of the expectation of future asset returns, namely fundamentalist, chartist and noise trader, and analyzed the impact of these three components of trading strategies on the statistical properties of prices and order flows. Through this model, it turns out that fat tails are caused by the chartist strategy. Malek and Ezzeddine (2011) consider three different types of investors; fundamental agents, irrational <b>agents,</b> and loss <b>adverse</b> <b>agents,</b> and show that irrational investors can explain the excess volatility of stock prices. They focus on the volatility puzzle which is hard to explain with traditional financial theories including efficient market hypothesis. Chiarella et al. (2006) consider a financial market with both a risky asset and a safe asset with a view to explain asset price and wealth dynamics as a result of the interaction between two groups of agents, fundamentalists and chartists.|$|R

When agents are risk neutral, an intermediate mass of types is also pooled, although they are offered contracts with variable payments and get positive rents. In addition, the region of types who exert high effort is contained in the first-best high-effort region and, unlike in pure adverse selection models, the model may feature “distortion at the boundary. ” Under additional conditions, the optimal mechanism offers only finitely many contracts.
