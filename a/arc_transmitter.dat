2500|$|At the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, Valdemar Poulsen had {{presented}} {{a paper on}} an <b>arc</b> <b>transmitter,</b> which unlike the discontinuous pulses produced by spark transmitters, created steady [...] "continuous wave" [...] signals {{that could be used}} for amplitude modulated (AM) audio transmissions. Although Poulsen had patented his invention, de Forest claimed to have come up with a variation that allowed him to avoid infringing on Poulsen's work. Using his [...] "sparkless" [...] <b>arc</b> <b>transmitter,</b> de Forest first transmitted audio across a lab room on December 31, 1906, and by February was making experimental transmissions, including music produced by Thaddeus Cahill's telharmonium, that were heard throughout the city.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the station}} opened in 1912 it used a [...] {{quenched}} spark-gap transmitter manufactured by Telefunken, and a receiver with a locally built crystal detector (using galena from Northampton). In 1916 the transmitter was upgraded (by the Navy) to a [...] Poulsen <b>arc</b> <b>transmitter</b> and vacuum tube receiver.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{experiments}} in AM radio transmission, conducted by Fessenden, Valdemar Poulsen, Ernst Ruhmer, Quirino Majorana, Charles Harrold, and Lee De Forest, were {{hampered by the}} lack of a technology for amplification. [...] The first practical continuous wave AM transmitters [...] were based on either the huge, expensive Alexanderson alternator, developed 1906-1910, or versions of the Poulsen <b>arc</b> <b>transmitter</b> (arc converter), invented in 1903. [...] The modifications necessary to transmit AM were clumsy and resulted in [...] very low quality audio. [...] Modulation was usually accomplished by a carbon microphone inserted directly in the antenna or ground wire; its varying resistance varied the current to the antenna. [...] The limited power handling ability of the microphone severely limited the power of the first radiotelephones; many of the microphones were water-cooled.|$|E
5000|$|NSS began {{transmitting}} in September, 1918 using 500 kilowatt Poulson <b>Arc</b> <b>transmitters.</b> However, <b>arc</b> <b>transmitters</b> {{were significantly}} {{inferior to the}} then state-of-the-art Alexanderson alternator and the <b>arc</b> <b>transmitters</b> were replaced by more modern vacuum tube transmitters in 1931. VLF, or [...] "longwave" [...] radio was the standard at the time for long range radio transmission, later to be generally replaced by shortwave.|$|R
50|$|<b>Arc</b> <b>transmitters</b> were {{installed}} in 1909, which increased {{the range of}} the station to 5000 kilometres.|$|R
25|$|Early radio {{telegraphy}} used {{spark gap}} and <b>arc</b> <b>transmitters</b> {{as well as}} high-frequency alternators running at radio frequencies. The coherer was the first means of detecting a radio signal. These, however, lacked the sensitivity to detect weak signals.|$|R

50|$|The <b>arc</b> <b>transmitter,</b> {{the first}} {{generator}} of continuous radio signals, {{was invented by}} Danish engineer Valdemar Poulsen. Rights were obtained by Lorenz to manufacture this transmitter, and the firm entered the commercial field of radio in 1906. Soon after this, Lorenz used the <b>arc</b> <b>transmitter</b> to develop for the German Navy the first radiotelephone. In 1919, in an experimental station at Eberswalde, Lorenz used a high-power Poulsen transmitter in what would become radio broadcasting. Most of the early broadcast stations in Germany used Lorenz transmitters.|$|E
5000|$|Almost {{all of the}} {{continuous}} wave AM transmissions made prior to 1915 were made by versions of the <b>arc</b> converter <b>transmitter,</b> which had been initially developed by Valdemar Poulsen in 1903. <b>Arc</b> <b>transmitters</b> worked by producing a pulsating electrical arc in an enclosed hydrogen atmosphere. They were much more compact than alternator transmitters, and could operate on somewhat higher transmitting frequencies. However, they suffered {{from some of the}} same deficiencies. The lack of any means to amplify electrical currents meant that, like the alternator transmitters, modulation was usually accomplished by a microphone inserted directly in the antenna wire, which again resulted in overheating issues, even with the use of water-cooled microphones. Thus, transmitter powers tended to be limited. The arc was also somewhat unstable, which reduced audio quality. Experimenters who used <b>arc</b> <b>transmitters</b> for their radiotelephone research included Ernst Ruhmer, Quirino Majorana, Charles [...] "Doc" [...] Herrold, and Lee de Forest.|$|R
5000|$|Malabar Radio Station was a VLF radio telegraphic {{transmitter}} in Malabar, Indonesia ( [...] coordinates: [...] ), for a {{radio link}} to the Netherlands. It used {{one of the most}} powerful <b>arc</b> <b>transmitters</b> ever built, which had a power of 2400 kW. Malabar Radio Station used a wire spun between two mountains as an antenna.|$|R
50|$|Duddell's circuit {{was limited}} to audio frequencies. However, Danish {{physicists}} Valdemar Poulsen and P. O. Pederson were able to increase the frequency of Duddell's oscillator to the radio range, and in 1902 patented the Poulsen <b>arc</b> radio <b>transmitter,</b> the first transmitter which could generate continuous waves. Poulsen <b>arc</b> wireless <b>transmitters</b> were used worldwide until the 1920s.|$|R

50|$|The {{date for}} the {{official}} opening of this station was set at May 5, 1923. However, a tropical lightning strike destroyed some of the equipment and the opening was postponed until repairs were completed.

50|$|Peder Oluf Pedersen (19 June 1874 - 30 August 1941) was a Danish {{engineer}} and physicist. He is notable {{for his work}} on electrotechnology and his cooperation with Valdemar Poulsen on the developmental work on Wire recorders, which he called a telegraphone, and the arc converter known as the Poulsen <b>Arc</b> <b>Transmitter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Valdemar Poulsen (23 November 1869 - 23 July 1942) was a Danish {{engineer}} who {{made significant contributions}} to early radio technology. He developed a magnetic wire recorder called the telegraphone in 1899 and the first continuous wave radio transmitter, the Poulsen <b>arc</b> <b>transmitter,</b> in 1903, which was used in some of the first broadcasting stations until the early 1920s.|$|E
50|$|From 1913 to 1919 he led {{development}} and manufacture of very large Poulsen <b>arc</b> <b>transmitters</b> (ranging in sizes from 200, 350, 500 {{and up to}} 1,000 kilowatts) for the Army and Navy, which were then installed in stations for trans-oceanic communications in the United States, France, Panama, Hawaii, and across the Pacific to the Philippines. He {{was a member of}} the National Research Council's antisubmarine group in World War I, and also continued his studies at Stanford University, receiving Stanford's first Ph.D. granted in electrical engineering in 1919.|$|R
5000|$|Advances in {{vacuum tube}} {{technology}} (called [...] "valves" [...] in British usage), especially after around 1915, revolutionized radio technology. Vacuum tubes devices {{could be used}} to amplify electrical currents, which overcame the overheating issues of needing to insert microphones directly in the transmission antenna circuit. Vacuum tube transmitters also provided high-quality AM signals, and could operate on higher transmitting frequencies than alternator and <b>arc</b> <b>transmitters.</b> Non-governmental radio transmissions were prohibited in many countries during World War I, but AM radiotelephony technology advanced greatly due to wartime research, and after the war the availability of tubes sparked a great {{increase in the number of}} amateur radio stations experimenting with AM transmission of news or music. Vacuum tubes remained the central technology of radio for 40 years, until transistors began to dominate in the 1960s, and are still used in the highest power broadcast transmitters.|$|R
5000|$|... 1907-1912 Lee de Forest {{conducted}} {{a series of}} test broadcasts beginning in 1907, and was widely quoted promoting the potential of organized radio broadcasting. Using a series of <b>arc</b> <b>transmitters,</b> he made his first entertainment broadcast on February 1907, transmitting electronic telharmonium music from his [...] "Highbridge" [...] laboratory station in New York City. This was followed by tests that included, in the fall, Eugenia Farrar singing [...] "I Love You Truly". Additional promotional events in New York included live performances by famous Metropolitan Opera stars such as Mariette Mazarin, Geraldine Farrar, and Enrico Caruso. He also broadcast phonograph music from the Eiffel Tower in Paris. His company equipped the U.S. Navy's Great White Fleet with experimental arc radiotelephones for their 1908 around-the-world cruise, and the operators broadcast phonograph music as the ships entered ports like San Francisco and Honolulu.|$|R
5000|$|July 21, 1912 The {{first person}} to {{transmit}} entertainment broadcasts on a regular schedule {{appears to have been}} Charles [...] "Doc" [...] Herrold, who inaugurated weekly programs, using an <b>arc</b> <b>transmitter,</b> from his Wireless School station in San Jose, California. The broadcasts continued until the station was shut down due to the entrance of the United States into World War I in April 1917.|$|E
5000|$|Immediately {{after the}} end of the war, there were four such {{stations}} in the Dutch East Indies, and these were all designated with callsigns in the new PK series: PKA Sabang, PKB Weltevreden, PKC Sitoebondo, and PKD Koepang. Soon afterwards, the Dutch government in Batavia announced that a huge <b>arc</b> <b>transmitter</b> station, using Telefunken arc equipment, was under installation at Malabar, near Bandoeng. This massive 3.5 megawatt station was established for communication with the home office in the Netherlands.|$|E
5000|$|The Goldschmidt {{alternator}} was one {{of several}} types of rotating [...] "radio frequency alternator" [...] machines used as radio transmitters during the first two decades of the 20th century. [...] Alternator transmitters produced a [...] "cleaner" [...] signal with less harmonics than their main competitor, the Poulsen <b>arc</b> <b>transmitter</b> so they were used in the highest power telegraphy stations. The machines differed in how they solved the fundamental problem of producing high frequencies without exceeding the mechanical capabilities of rotating machines: ...|$|E
5000|$|Since the arc {{took some}} time to strike and operate in a stable fashion, normal on-off keying could not be used. Instead, a form of {{frequency}} shift keying was employed. In this compensation-wave method, the arc operated continuously, and the key altered {{the frequency of the}} arc by one to five percent. The signal at the unwanted frequency was called the compensation-wave. In <b>arc</b> <b>transmitters</b> up to 70 kW, the key typically shorted out a few turns in the antenna coil. For larger arcs, the arc output would be transformer coupled to the antenna inductor, and the key would short out a few bottom turns of the grounded secondary. Therefore, the [...] "mark" [...] (key closed) was sent at one frequency, and the [...] "space" [...] (key open) at another frequency. If these frequencies were far enough apart, and the receiving station's receiver had adequate selectivity, the receiving station would hear standard CW when tuned to the [...] "mark" [...] frequency.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{primitive}} radio transmitters (called Hertzian oscillators) {{were built}} by German physicist Heinrich Hertz in 1887 during his pioneering investigations of radio waves. These generated radio waves {{by a high}} voltage spark between two conductors. Beginning in 1895 Guglielmo Marconi developed the first practical radio communication systems using spark transmitters. They couldn't transmit audio (sound) and instead transmitted information by telegraphy, the operator tapping on a telegraph key which turned the transmitter on and off to produce pulses of radio waves spelling out text messages in Morse code. These spark-gap transmitters were used {{during the first three}} decades of radio (1887-1917), called the wireless telegraphy or [...] "spark" [...] era. Because they generated damped waves, spark transmitters were electrically [...] "noisy"; their energy was spread over a broad band of frequencies, creating radio noise which interfered with other transmitters. Two short-lived competing transmitter technologies came into use {{after the turn of the}} century, which were the first continuous wave transmitters: the Alexanderson alternator and Poulsen <b>arc</b> <b>transmitters,</b> which were used into the 1920s.|$|R
30|$|Transducers {{that are}} widely applied in cement bond {{evaluation}} tools, such as cement bond logs and variable density logs, cannot radiate acoustic energy directionally {{because of the}} characteristics of monopole sources. A phased <b>arc</b> array <b>transmitter,</b> which is a novel transducer that differs from monopole and dipole transducers, is presented in this study. To simulate the acoustic field generated by a phased arc array in a fluid-filled cased borehole with different channelings, a 3 D finite-difference time-domain method is adopted. The acoustic field generated by a traditional monopole source is also simulated and compared with the field generated by the phased <b>arc</b> array <b>transmitter.</b> Numerical simulation results show that the phased arc array radiates energy directionally in a narrow angular range in the borehole, thereby compressing the acoustic energy into a narrow range in the casing pipe, the cement, and the formation. We present the analyses of first-arrival waveforms and the amplitudes of casing waves at different azimuthal angles for the two different sources. The results indicate that employing a directional source facilitates azimuthal identification and analysis of possible channeling behind the casing pipe.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} NAA {{installation}} was completed, the Federal Telegraph Company got grudging permission to install {{one of its}} 35 kilowatt Poulsen arc transmitters, for comparative tests with the rotary-spark transmitter. To the surprise of Navy personnel, even though the <b>arc</b> <b>transmitter</b> had {{only about half the}} power, it was found to be clearly superior. As a result, arc transmitters would be installed at the other high-powered stations, and they became the standard for naval installations until the development of vacuum tube transmitters in the early 1920s.|$|E
50|$|The arc converter, {{sometimes}} called the <b>arc</b> <b>transmitter,</b> or Poulsen arc after Danish engineer Valdemar Poulsen who invented it in 1903, was a variety of spark transmitter used in early wireless telegraphy. The arc converter used an electric arc to convert direct current electricity into radio frequency alternating current. It {{was used as a}} radio transmitter from 1903 until the 1920s when it was replaced by vacuum tube transmitters. One of the first transmitters that could generate continuous sinusoidal waves, {{it was one of the}} first technologies used to transmit sound (amplitude modulation) by radio. It is on the list of IEEE Milestones as a historic achievement in electrical engineering.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the next}} two years Sarnoff earned {{promotions}} to chief inspector and contracts manager for a company whose revenues swelled after Congress passed legislation mandating continuous staffing of commercial shipboard radio stations. That same year Marconi won a patent suit that gave it the coastal stations of the United Wireless Telegraph Company. Sarnoff also demonstrated the first use of radio on a railroad line, the Lackawanna Railroad Company's link between Binghamton, New York, and Scranton, Pennsylvania; and permitted and observed Edwin Armstrong's demonstration of his regenerative receiver at the Marconi station at Belmar, New Jersey. Sarnoff used H. J. Round's hydrogen <b>arc</b> <b>transmitter</b> to demonstrate the broadcast of music from the New York Wanamaker station.|$|E
50|$|With the {{development}} of the <b>arc</b> converter radio <b>transmitter</b> in 1904, continuous wave (CW) modulation began to be used for radiotelegraphy. CW Morse code signals are not amplitude modulated, but rather consist of bursts of sinusoidal carrier frequency. When CW signals are received by an AM receiver, the operator does not hear a sound. The direct-conversion (heterodyne) detector was invented to make continuous wave radio-frequency signals audible.|$|R
5000|$|The Bureau of Engineering {{decided to}} explore the {{frequency}} range 3000 to 4000 kHz for short-range fighter and spotting aircraft communication and sponsored NRL's Research Laboratory's effort to provide suitable equipment (1926).

These were followed by the <b>ARC</b> GF <b>transmitter</b> (5000 to 8000 kHz), accompanied by the ARC Model RU receiver. (1931-1933).

The Model GF/RU (Aircraft Radio Corporation) was procured in large numbers and used extensively, and continued in use through World War II. (emphasis added) ...|$|R
