25|$|Sound is {{transmitted}} through gases, plasma, and liquids as longitudinal waves, also called compression waves. It requires a medium to propagate. Through solids, however, {{it can be}} transmitted as both longitudinal waves and transverse waves. Longitudinal sound waves are waves of alternating pressure deviations from the equilibrium pressure, causing local regions of compression and rarefaction, while transverse waves (in solids) are waves of alternating shear stress <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> to the direction of propagation.|$|E
25|$|A Hypostyle, i.e., an open hall {{supported}} by columns {{combined with a}} reception hall set <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> to the main hall, {{is considered to be}} derived from architectural traditions of Achaemenid period Persian assembly halls ("apadana"). This type of building originated from the Roman-style basilica with an adjacent courtyard surrounded by colonnades, like Trajan's Forum in Rome. The Roman type of building has developed out of the Greek agora. In Islamic architecture, the hypostyle hall is the main feature of the hypostyle mosque. One of the earliest hypostyle mosques is the Tarikhaneh Mosque in Iran, dating back to the 8th century.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1509 and 1510, Duarte D'Armas {{designed}} the castle in his Book of Fortresses, which he represented with an elliptical irregular barbican, crowned with merlons, except [...] "a barrier without crenels toppled {{to the ground}} and the inside wall", addorsed in the corner by a small rectangular tower. This tower was only {{in the early stages of}} construction. At the time, the castle was an irregular polygon, with two towers in the north, one pentagonal and the other rectangular, with a semi-circular corbel. Within the structure was a military square with two ruined buildings and 11 chambers, rectangular and trapezoidal, a few with roof and cylindrical chimneys. In addition, there was a rectangular keep tower, with arrow-slits, that was built over cliffs, addorsed by residence of the Paço dos Távoras (consisting of three rectangular spaces of different heights). The one alongside the keep was the shortest, and included a full arch and four rectangular windows; the space, taller, included two-floors illuminated by arched windows with wooden balcony and topped by merlons; and the final, slightly shorter, included full-arch windows on the first floor and rectangular windows on the second-floor, surmounted by merlons. Access to the fortress was made by means of stairs <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angle,</b> under which is a passage military square, with a circular well. Outside the walls, to addorsed to the east is a rabbit shed attached to the barbican, and from the same location extended the town, with its pillory. Opposite the houses on the outskirts of the village, was a church with steeple next to the barbican, and further away, a cross and five houses with cultivated lands.|$|E

6000|$|Upon {{the end of}} the [...] "shank" [...] {{fits the}} head of the harpoon, known by the names swordfish-iron, lily-iron, and Indian dart. The form of this weapon has {{undergone}} much variation. The fundamental idea may very possibly have been derived from the Indian fish-dart, numerous specimens of which are in the National Museum, from various tribes of Indians of New England, British America, and the Pacific. However various the modifications may have been, the similarity of the different shapes is no less noteworthy from the fact that all are peculiarly American. In the enormous collection of fishery implements of all lands at the late exhibition at Berlin, nothing of the kind could be found. What is known to whalers as a toggle-harpoon is a modification of the lily-iron, but so greatly changed by the addition of a pivot by which the head of the harpoon is fastened to the shank that it can hardly be regarded as the same weapon. The lily-iron is, in principle, exactly what a whaleman would describe by the word [...] "toggle." [...] It consists of a two-pointed piece of metal, having in the center, at one side, a ring or socket the axis of which is parallel with the long diameter of the implement. In this is inserted {{the end of the}} pole-shank, and to it or near it is also attached the harpoon-line. When the iron has once been thrust point first through some solid substance, such as the side of a fish, and is released upon the other side by the withdrawal of the pole from the socket, it is free, and at once turns its long axis <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> to the direction in which the harpoon-line is pulling, and this is absolutely prevented from withdrawal. The principle of the whale harpoon or toggle-iron is similar, except that the pole is not withdrawn, and the head, turning upon a pivot at its end, fastens the pole itself securely to the fish, the harpoon-line being attached to some part of the pole. The swordfish lily-iron head, as now ordinarily used, is about four inches in length, and consists of two lanceolate blades, each about {{an inch and a half}} long, connected by a central piece much thicker than they, in which, upon one side, and next to the flat side of the blade, is the socket for the insertion of the pole-shank. In this same central enlargement is forged an opening to which the harpoon-line is attached. The dart-head is usually made of steel; sometimes of iron, which is generally galvanized; sometimes of brass.|$|E
