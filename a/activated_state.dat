25|$|Antithrombin {{begins in}} its native state, {{which has a}} higher free energy {{compared}} to the latent state, which it decays to on average after 3 days.

25|$|At {{the same}} time, chemokines {{released}} by macrophages activate the rolling leukocytes and cause surface integrin molecules {{to switch from}} the default low-affinity state to a high-affinity state. This is assisted through juxtacrine activation of integrins by chemokines and soluble factors released by endothelial cells. In the <b>activated</b> <b>state,</b> integrins bind tightly to complementary receptors expressed on endothelial cells, with high affinity. This causes the immobilisation of the leukocytes, despite the sheer forces of the ongoing blood flow.|$|E
50|$|It can be {{understood}} from these experiments that the increased reactivity observed for hypervalent molecules, contrasted with analogous nonhypervalent compounds, {{can be attributed to}} the congruence of these species to the hypercoordinated <b>activated</b> <b>states</b> normally formed during the course of the reaction.|$|R
40|$|Sensory inputs {{from the}} {{whiskers}} reach the primary somatosensory thalamus through the medial lemniscus tract. The main {{role of the}} thalamus is to relay these sensory inputs to the neocortex according to the regulations dictated by behavioural state. Intracellular recordings in urethane-anaesthetized rats show that whisker stimulation evokes EPSP-IPSP sequences in thalamic neurons. Both EPSPs and IPSPs depress with repetitive whisker stimulation at frequencies above 2 Hz. Single-unit recordings reveal that during quiescent states thalamic responses to repetitive whisker stimulation are suppressed at frequencies above 2 Hz, so that only low-frequency sensory stimulation is relayed to the neocortex. In contrast, during <b>activated</b> <b>states,</b> induced by stimulation of the brainstem reticular formation or application of acetylcholine in the thalamus, high-frequency whisker stimulation at up to 40 Hz is relayed to the neocortex. Sensory suppression {{is caused by the}} depression of lemniscal EPSPs in relatively hyperpolarized thalamocortical neurons. Sensory suppression is abolished during <b>activated</b> <b>states</b> because thalamocortical neurons depolarize and the depressed lemniscal EPSPs are able to reach firing threshold. Strong IPSPs may also contribute to sensory suppression by hyperpolarizing thalamocortical neurons, but during <b>activated</b> <b>states</b> IPSPs are strongly reduced altogether. The results indicate that the synaptic depression of lemniscal EPSPs and the level of depolarization of thalamocortical neurons work together in thalamic primary sensory pathways to suppress high-frequency sensory inputs during non-activated (quiescent) states while permitting the faithful relay of high-frequency sensory information during <b>activated</b> (processing) <b>states...</b>|$|R

25|$|LA drugs act {{mainly by}} {{inhibiting}} sodium influx through sodium-specific ion channels in the neuronal cell membrane, {{in particular the}} so-called voltage-gated sodium channels. When the influx of sodium is interrupted, an action potential cannot arise and signal conduction is inhibited. The receptor site {{is thought to be}} located at the cytoplasmic (inner) portion of the sodium channel. Local anesthetic drugs bind more readily to sodium channels in an <b>activated</b> <b>state,</b> thus onset of neuronal blockade is faster in rapidly firing neurons. This is referred to as state-dependent blockade.|$|E
500|$|Sponges do {{not have}} the complex immune systems of most other animals. [...] However they reject grafts from other species but accept them from other members of their own species. [...] In a few marine species, gray cells play the leading role in {{rejection}} of foreign material. When invaded, they produce a chemical that stops movement of other cells in the affected area, thus preventing the intruder from using the sponge's internal transport systems. If the intrusion persists, the grey cells concentrate in the area and release toxins that kill all cells in the area. The [...] "immune" [...] system can stay in this <b>activated</b> <b>state</b> for up to three weeks.|$|E
2500|$|The most intensively studied type of voltage-dependent ion {{channels}} {{comprises the}} sodium channels involved in fast nerve conduction. These are sometimes known as Hodgkin-Huxley sodium channels {{because they were}} first characterized by Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in their Nobel Prize-winning studies of the biophysics of the action potential, but can more conveniently {{be referred to as}} NaV channels. (The [...] "V" [...] stands for [...] "voltage".) [...] An NaV channel has three possible states, known as deactivated, activated, and inactivated. The channel is permeable only to sodium ions when it is in the <b>activated</b> <b>state.</b> When the membrane potential is low, the channel spends most of its time in the deactivated (closed) state. If the membrane potential is raised above a certain level, the channel shows increased probability of transitioning to the activated (open) state. The higher the membrane potential the greater the probability of activation. Once a channel has activated, it will eventually transition to the inactivated (closed) state. It tends then to stay inactivated for some time, but, if the membrane potential becomes low again, the channel will eventually transition back to the deactivated state. During an action potential, most channels of this type go through a cycle deactivated→activated→inactivated→deactivated. This is only the population average behavior, however — an individual channel can in principle make any transition at any time. However, the likelihood of a channel's transitioning from the inactivated state directly to the <b>activated</b> <b>state</b> is very low: A channel in the inactivated state is refractory until it has transitioned back to the deactivated state.|$|E

2500|$|Potassium {{voltage-gated}} channel, Isk-related family, member 3 (KCNE3), {{also known}} as MinK-related peptide 2 (MiRP2) [...] is a protein that in humans is encoded by the KCNE3 gene. Specific amino acids within the transmembrane segment (V72) and extracellular domain (D54 and D55) of KCNE3 are important for its control of KCNQ1 voltage dependence. D54 and D55 interact electrostatically with R237 in the S4 segment of the KCNQ1 voltage sensor, helping to stabilize S4 in the <b>activated</b> <b>state,</b> which in turn locks open the channel unless the cell is held at a strongly hyperpolarizing (negative) membrane potential. The ability of KCNQ1-KCNE3 channels to remain open at weakly negative membrane potentials permits their activity in non-excitable, polarized epithelial cells {{such as those in}} the intestine.|$|E
2500|$|Synapses may be {{electrical}} or chemical. [...] Electrical synapses make direct {{electrical connections}} between neurons, but chemical synapses {{are much more}} common, and much more diverse in function. [...] At a chemical synapse, the cell that sends signals is called presynaptic, and the cell that receives signals is called postsynaptic. [...] Both the presynaptic and postsynaptic areas are full of molecular machinery that carries out the signalling process. [...] The presynaptic area contains large numbers of tiny spherical vessels called synaptic vesicles, packed with neurotransmitter chemicals. [...] When the presynaptic terminal is electrically stimulated, an array of molecules embedded in the membrane are activated, and cause {{the contents of the}} vesicles to be released into the narrow space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, called the synaptic cleft. [...] The neurotransmitter then binds to receptors embedded in the postsynaptic membrane, causing them to enter an <b>activated</b> <b>state.</b> [...] Depending on the type of receptor, the resulting effect on the postsynaptic cell may be excitatory, inhibitory, or modulatory in more complex ways. For example, release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at a synaptic contact between a motor neuron and a muscle cell induces rapid contraction of the muscle cell. [...] The entire synaptic transmission process takes only a fraction of a millisecond, although the effects on the postsynaptic cell may last much longer (even indefinitely, in cases where the synaptic signal leads to the formation of a memory trace).|$|E

40|$|Rhodopsins are {{the members}} of the family of G protein-coupled receptors that have diverged from ligand-binding receptors into photoreceptive pigments. Vertebrate rhodopsins are able to bind the inverse agonist 11 -cis-retinal but are unable to bind the agonist all-trans-retinal, {{indicating}} that vertebrate rhodopsin changed its binding ability during the course of molecular evolution. Here, we show that unlike vertebrate rhodopsin, amphioxus rhodopsin is still able to bind the agonist all-trans-retinal. The opsin of amphioxus rhodopsin can also bind 11 -cis-retinal to form a photoreceptive pigment that can convert to a red-shifted photoproduct through cis-trans isomerization of the chromophore upon photon absorption. The red-shifted photoproduct is the stable G protein <b>activating</b> <b>state.</b> Incubation of the opsin with all-trans-retinal produces a G protein <b>activating</b> <b>state</b> that is spectroscopically and biochemically indistinguishable from the red-shifted photoproduct, indicating that the opsin possesses agonist-binding ability. The opsin exhibits an ≈ 50 -fold higher affinity for 11 -cis-retinal than for all-trans-retinal, and mutational analyses revealed that Trp- 265 situated in helix VI is important for the increase in binding affinity to 11 -cis-retinal. These properties of amphioxus rhodopsin suggest that an ancestral rhodopsin increased the affinity for 11 -cis-retinal by rearrangement of a structure including Trp- 265 to act as a photoreceptor. In addition, an additional mechanism was acquired in vertebrate rhodopsin to prevent completely the binding of exogenous all-trans-retinal during molecular evolution...|$|R
