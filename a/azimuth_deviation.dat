30|$|The {{location}} of an earthquake-related infrasound source {{can be calculated}} using an inverse location procedure and the earthquake’s seismic and infrasound data (Le Pichon et al., 2002). The {{location of}} each detected infrasonic signal can be back-projected on its back-azimuth value to the source location. The distance of the projection is inversely determined by fitting the observed infrasound arrival time to the calculated time, which includes seismic propagation time from the hypocenter to any source point and infrasound travel time from the source point to the receiver. This study used a method {{that is similar to}} the inverse location method and incorporates ray-tracing results to calculate <b>azimuth</b> <b>deviation</b> and celerity variation depending on source-to-receiver paths (ray-tracing is discussed further below). Celerity refers to a propagation velocity that is calculated by dividing the propagation range from the source to the receiver by the travel time. From the ray-tracing, the celerity and <b>azimuth</b> <b>deviation</b> of eigenrays were calculated for each geographical location to the receiver, covering a broad source area within 34 – 44 °N and 125 – 145 °E to include all possible sources. The resulting maps show how these parameters vary depending on the location of the assumed sources. In addition to the maps, times of peak ground motion at sources were interpolated from real seismological data. An infrasound source map was then made, in which each geographic point has its own possible infrasound travel time that includes both the propagation time of realistic seismic waves and infrasound calculated from the celerity map. Each point on the map has a corrected azimuth value that is calculated from the <b>azimuth</b> <b>deviation</b> map. For azimuths, this approach allows correction of <b>azimuth</b> <b>deviation</b> along a great circle, where differences are caused by different propagation paths and infrasound phases. Finally, the best source locations for each detected signal (points in Fig. 1 (b)) were grid-searched from the infrasound source map in terms of infrasound arrival time and azimuth measured at the receiver.|$|E

The {{restoration of}} the soundtrack however has mainly been performed at the audio domain {{in spite of the}} fast that it is recorded as a continuous image on the film stock. In this paper, we propose a new restoration method for variable density soundtracks. The method first detects and corrects accurately the <b>azimuth</b> <b>deviation.</b> A robust thresholding technique based on the minimization of the total variation is then performed to remove the remaining faults.

40|$|The Yasur volcano in the Vanuatu {{archipelago}} is {{an outstanding}} source of infrasonic waves due to its regular activity. This volcano is permanently monitored by the I 22 FR infrasound station located in New-Caledonia at about 400 km, and by one microbarometer installed on its crater. This favorable setting allows thorough studies on infrasound propagation based on multi-year observations. We propose a continuous monitoring of Yasur to consistently validate the NRL-G 2 S semi-empirical atmospheric models up to the stratosphere. The results of propagation modeling accurately explain seasonal changes as well as fine short-time scale variations of the infrasonic observables. The <b>azimuth</b> <b>deviation</b> is predicted with an uncertainty in general lower than 0. 5 °. The fluctuations of the trace velocity and the celerity are simulated with errors as large as 5 m/s. This study demonstrates {{that the use of}} appropriate propagation tools along with the NRL-G 2 S specifications provide accurate enough results for most of the long-range observations for the purpose of operational infrasound monitoring...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe BURAR seismic array, {{located in}} Northern Romania (Bucovina region), is {{designed}} to monitor events located in an area poorly covered by other existing seismic stations. In order to use the BURAR array for single-station locations, {{it is crucial to}} calibrate the azimuth and slowness parameters, which are currently used in array techniques to locate earthquakes, blasts or nuclear explosions. The goal {{of this study is to}} apply "f-k" and plane wave fit techniques in order to constrain the slowness and azimuth parameters at BURAR for teleseismic, regional and local events. The analysis was carried out using P and S waves recorded for events occurred between 2004 and 2008 within a radius of 50 ° around BURAR. The azimuth values obtained applying both methods strongly deviated from the theoretical values for regions like Central Turkey, Bulgaria, Dodecanese Islands and other parts of Greece, while the ray parameter deviations with respect to a 1 -D IASP 91 reference model are less significant. For the local events, the anomalies are smaller, except the particular case of Vrancea intermediate-depth earthquakes for which strong <b>azimuth</b> <b>deviations</b> (33. 5 °), both positive and negative, are observed. We investigate how these systematic <b>deviations</b> in <b>azimuth</b> are explained by the structure lateral heterogeneities which characterize the study region...|$|R
40|$|Q-bursts are {{globally}} detectable {{extremely low}} frequency (ELF, 3 - 3000 Hz) band wave packets produced by intense lightning discharges. Q-bursts recorded in the Széchenyi István Geophysical Observatory (NCK, 16. 7 °E, 47. 6 °N), Hungary, on 1 and 2 August 2012 have been analyzed to find azimuths of their sources. The location of parent lightning strokes of 320 and 205 Q-bursts on the 2 days, respectively, {{have been identified in}} the records of the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) using the detection times at NCK. ELF data-based source azimuths were found to differ systematically from source azimuths obtained from WWLLN lightning locations. The difference between the corresponding azimuth values depends on the azimuth of the source. This variation of the source azimuth error mirrors the symmetry of the conductance of the Earth's crust inferred from magnetotelluric measurements around NCK. After correction for the azimuthal dependence, the variation of the residual error shows a diurnal pattern with positive <b>azimuth</b> <b>deviations</b> occurring near midnight, local time. Füllekrug and Sukhorukov (1999) suggested that the anisotropic conductivity in the Earth's crust below the observatory and the different daytime and nighttime conductivities in the lower ionosphere, respectively, may cause the identified error terms. Our results emphasize the substantial effect of anisotropic conductivity in the Earth's crust around the recording station on the accuracy of ELF direction finding. The need for theoretical approach and more measurements is pointed in understanding the underlying mechanisms quantitatively and in investigating whether ELF observations can be used in geophysical prospecting. © 2016.

The recent data {{are added to the}} previous data given by Sassa [1936] and the total data exhibit a systematic azimuthal <b>deviation</b> with <b>azimuth.</b> The <b>deviation</b> can be interpreted by the following structural model under the Aso Caldera: a tectonic line or zone runs across the center of the caldera from east to west, the northern block inclining nearly eastwards with the dip of about 15 ° and the southern block toward NNE with the dip of about 25 ° It is also shown that the chain of the central volcanoes is situated on the tectonic line or zone and that the sky-line of the caldera rim has a similar inclination to that of each block...|$|R
40|$|Systematic sensor errors complicate {{centralized}} data fusion. [1] sensor model specific alignment procedures, {{which allow}} the compensation of essential bias values like <b>azimuth</b> <b>deviation</b> and range offset, donot remove systematic errors completely. The residual errors, like time differences between different sources and varying spatial deviations, {{lead to a}} reduction of the tracking performance in the centralized architecture. A detailed statistic of deviations between predicted track states and observations, evaluated for each track and each sensor, provides additional model independent bias information. It turns out, that this information issufficient for afurther decisive reduction of the residual errors. A feedback control mechanism can be established, which allows acontinuous compensation of sensor and track specific bias values down to a level appropriate for the application ofadvanced recursive tracking methods. The centralized tracking, supported by bias control, finally gains its superiority over track fusion mainly fromthe following capabilities: Maneuverrecognition based on bias controlled, multiple source measurements Recursive filter selectionaccording to themaneuvercondition Performance enhancement in grouptracking, 2 Ddata processing, track initiation and correlationgatedetermination The processing of the complete set of aligned data, recursively adapted tothe target maneuver, allows anoptimal use of information from allcontributing sensors. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the infrasound signals from seismic groundmotions induced by North Korea’s underground nuclear explosions, including the recent third explosion on 2013 February 12. For the third explosion, the epicentral infrasound signals were detected {{not only by}} three infrasound network stations (KSGAR, ULDAR and YAGAR) in South Korea but also by two nearby International Monitoring System infrasound stations, IS 45 and IS 30. The detectability of the signals was limited at stations located on the relatively {{east side of the}} epicentre, with large azimuth deviations due to very favourable atmospheric conditions for eastward propagation at stratospheric height in 2013. The stratospheric wind direction was the reverse of that when the second explosion was conducted in 2009 May. The source location of the epicentral infrasound with wave parameters determined at the multiple stations has an offset by about 16. 6 km from the reference seismic location. It was possible to determine the infrasonic location with moderate accuracy by the correction of the <b>azimuth</b> <b>deviation</b> due to the eastward winds in the stratosphere. In addition to the epicentral infrasonic signals, diffracted infrasound signalswere observed from the second underground nuclear explosion in 2009. The exceptional detectability of the diffracted infrasound was a consequence of the temporal formation of a thin atmospheric inversion layer over the ocean surface when the event occurred.

40|$|Article is {{dedicated}} to analysis of burial rituals of the Golden Horde cemeteries without burial mounds in surroundings of the Tsarevskoe ancient settlement. 51 burials (19. 9 % of total number) in mausoleums or in crypts can be attributed as burials of the Golden Horde aristocracy. In the graves found without burial mounds the most wide-spread were of western, south-western and north-western (which could be considered as <b>azimuth</b> <b>deviation</b> from western) orientations (they comprise 94. 9 % of all burials), which are peculiar {{to the majority of}} the urban Muslim population of the Golden Horde. However it must be considered that 56 from these burials (21. 9 % of total number) are burials of necropolis of the population of Old Russian settlement of the Vodyanskoe site. Comparing the aristocratic (in mausoleums and crypts) burials without burial mounds in the Lower Volga, it is possible conclude that their percentage was significantly higher in the region of the Tsarevskoe settlement, than in other regions; these data allow to assume here the greatest density of residence of settled elite of the Golden Horde. The smallest share of Muslim burials in coffins in the Lower Volga (44. 9 %) and the maximal one of burials with grave goods (13. 6 %) recorded in the region of the Tsarevskoe site. Burial grounds in the region of the Tsarevskoe ancient settlement were in vicinity of the settlements, that is clearly testified about the degree of territorial closeness of cemeteries of settled population of the Golden Horde with urban and rural settlements of the considered period...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{describes}} some multilayer diffusion {{models and}} a computer program for these models developed to predict the impact of ground clouds formed during Space Shuttle launches on ambient air quality. The diffusion models {{are based on the}} Gaussian plume equation for an instantaneous volume source. Cloud growth is estimated on the basis of measurable meteorological parameters: standard deviation of the wind <b>azimuth</b> angle, standard <b>deviation</b> of wind elevation angle, vertical wind-speed shear, vertical wind-direction shear, and depth of the surface mixing layer. Calculations using these models indicate that Space Shuttle launches under a variety of meteorological regimes at Kennedy Space Center and Vandenberg AFB are unlikely to endanger the exposure standards for HCl; similar results have been obtained for CO and Al 2 O 3. However, the possibility that precipitation scavenging of the ground cloud might result in an acidic rain that could damage vegetation has not been investigated...|$|R
40|$|When {{applying}} the ray tracing in ionospheric propagation, the electron density modelling {{is the main}} input of the algorithm, since phase refractive index strongly depends on it. Also the magnetic field and frequency collision modelling have their importance, the former as responsible for the <b>azimuth</b> angle <b>deviation</b> of the vertical plane containing the radio wave, the latter {{for the evaluation of}} the absorption of the wave. Anyway, the electron density distribution is strongly dominant when one wants to evaluate the group delay time characterizing the ionospheric propagation. From the group delay time, azimuth and elevation angles it is possible to determine the point of arrival of the radio wave when it reaches the Earth surface. Moreover, the procedure to establish the target (T) position is one of the essential steps in the Over The Horizon Radar (OTHR) techniques which require the correct knowledge of the electron density distribution. The group delay time generally gives rough information of the ground range, which depends on the exact path of the radio wave in the ionosphere. This paper focuses on the lead role that is played by the variation of the electron density grid into the ray tracing algorithm, which is correlated to the change of the electron content along the ionospheric ray path, for obtaining a ray tracing as much reliable as possible. In many cases of practical interest, the group delay time depends on the geometric length and the electron content of the ray path. The issue is faced theoretically, and a simple analytical relation, between the variation of the electron content along the path and the difference in time between the group delays, calculated and measured, both in the ionosphere and in the vacuum, is obtained and discussed. An example of how an oblique radio link can be improved by varying the electron density grid is also shown and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Drilling non-vertical wells, {{which is}} {{commonly}} used to enhance production, in particular in unconventional reservoirs with very low permeability, is subjected to rock mechanics related issues namely wellbore instabilities. Drilling in the same formation but with different deviations and at different directions would not result in similar response in terms of rock failures. This {{is due to the}} rotation of the induced stresses around the wellbore wall along its trajectory. The type of instabilities that the formation experiences around the wellbore is a function of formation’s mechanical properties and the status of in-situ stresses. It is clear that none of these natural parameters can be controlled or changed during drilling operation. However, the density of the mud weigh which is used to drill the wellbore could be optimised in order to mitigate or stop wellbore instability issues in the form of tensile failure or fracturing in case of using high mud density or shear failure or breakouts when a low mud weigh is used. Therefore, a safe mud weight window (MWW) can be determined for optimum drilling in terms of having the least issues related to wellbore instabilities. This MWW will change as the wellbore deviation changes. In this paper, the concept of constructing the rock mechanical model (RMM) which includes the rock mechanical properties as well as in-situ stress profiles is briefly presented. Then the RMM output corresponding to vertical well Arrowsmith- 1 which is a shale gas well drilled in the North Perth Basin of Australia will be used to calculate the safe MWW for drilling wellbores in different <b>azimuth</b> and <b>deviation</b> in the field. The results indicate how the MWW changes as a function of wellbore trajectory...|$|R
40|$|When a {{layer is}} {{overlying}} a half-space with a tilted interface, the refraction of seismic waves {{emerging from the}} half-space generally results in their reorientation away from the vertical plane of incidence, with the following consequences: The angle of emergence at the free surface and, thus, dT/dΔ will become azimuth dependent. The apparent direction of approach of the wave front along the free surface will, in general, {{be different from the}} true <b>azimuth.</b> The azimuthal <b>deviation</b> also varies with azimuth. A general formulation for the computation of the apparent azimuth and the angle of incidence at the free surface is obtained. The numerical corrections to the observed dT/dΔ and apparent azimuth, for a number of combinations of various dip angles and velocity contrasts, are tabulated. The tables may be helpful when the first and second derivatives of the travel time data are to be analyzed. Their comparison with observation can also be useful for making inferences about the underlying crustal structure. The latter approach has been applied to the P arrivals across the Tonto Forest Seismological Observatory (TFSO) array, Arizona. On the basis of these observations, the Mohorovičić discontinuity under the observatory appears to be dipping locally as much as eight degrees in the N 70 ° ± 5 °E direction...|$|R
40|$|The {{vestibular}} organ is {{a sensor}} that measures angular and linear accelerations with {{six degrees of}} freedom (6 DF). Complete or partial defects in the vestibular organ results in mild to severe equilibrium problems, such as vertigo, dizziness, oscillopsia, gait unsteadiness nausea and/or vomiting. A good and frequently used measure to quantify gaze stabilization is the gain, which is defined as the magnitude of compensatory eye movements with respect to imposed head movements. To test vestibular function more fully one has to realize that 3 D VOR ideally generates compensatory ocular rotations not only with a magnitude (gain) equal and opposite to the head rotation but also about an axis that is co-linear with the head rotation axis (alignment). Abnormal vestibular function thus results in changes in gain and changes in alignment of the 3 D VOR response. Here we describe a method to measure 3 D VOR using whole body rotation on a 6 DF motion platform. Although the method also allows testing translation VOR responses 1, we limit ourselves to a discussion of the method to measure 3 D angular VOR. In addition, we restrict ourselves here to description of data collected in healthy subjects in response to angular sinusoidal and impulse stimulation. Subjects are sitting upright and receive whole-body small amplitude sinusoidal and constant acceleration impulses. Sinusoidal stimuli (f = 1 Hz, A = 4 °) were delivered about the vertical axis and about axes in the horizontal plane varying between roll and pitch at increments of 22. 5 ° in azimuth. Impulses were delivered in yaw, roll and pitch and in the vertical canal planes. Eye movements were measured using the scleral search coil technique 2. Search coil signals were sampled at a frequency of 1 kHz. The input-output ratio (gain) and misalignment (co-linearity) of the 3 D VOR were calculated from the eye coil signals 3. Gain and co-linearity of 3 D VOR depended on the orientation of the stimulus axis. Systematic deviations were found in particular during horizontal axis stimulation. In the light the eye rotation axis was properly aligned with the stimulus axis at orientations 0 ° and 90 ° azimuth, but gradually deviated more and more towards 45 ° <b>azimuth.</b> The systematic <b>deviations</b> in misalignment for intermediate axes can be explained by a low gain for torsion (X-axis or roll-axis rotation) and a high gain for vertical eye movements (Y-axis or pitch-axis rotation (see Figure 2). Because intermediate axis stimulation leads a compensatory response based on vector summation of the individual eye rotation components, the net response axis will deviate because the gain for X- and Y-axis are different. In darkness the gain of all eye rotation components had lower values. The result was that the misalignment in darkness and for impulses had different peaks and troughs than in the light: its minimum value was reached for pitch axis stimulation and its maximum for roll axis stimulation. Case Presentation Nine subjects participated in the experiment. All subjects gave their informed consent. The experimental procedure was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Erasmus University Medical Center and adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki for research involving human subjects. Six subjects served as controls. Three subjects had a unilateral vestibular impairment due to a vestibular schwannoma. The age of control subjects (six males and three females) ranged from 22 to 55 years. None of the controls had visual or vestibular complaints due to neurological, cardio vascular and ophthalmic disorders. The age of the patients with schwannoma varied between 44 and 64 years (two males and one female). All schwannoma subjects were under medical surveillance and/or had received treatment by a multidisciplinary team consisting of an othorhinolaryngologist and a neurosurgeon of the Erasmus University Medical Center. Tested patients all had a right side vestibular schwannoma and underwent a wait and watch policy (Table 1; subjects N 1 -N 3) after being diagnosed with vestibular schwannoma.
