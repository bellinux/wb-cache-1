25|$|Lead is a {{soft metal}} (MH 1.5, but hardens close to melting) which, in many cases, {{is unable to}} support its own weight. It has a {{close-packed}} structure (BCN 12) but an abnormally large inter-atomic distance that {{has been attributed to}} partial ionisation of the lead atoms. It forms a semi-covalent dioxide PbO2; a covalently bonded sulfide PbS; covalently bonded halides; and a range of covalently bonded organolead compounds such as the lead(II) mercaptan Pb(SC2H5)2, lead tetra-acetate Pb(CH3CO2)4, and the once common, <b>anti-knock</b> <b>additive,</b> tetra-ethyl lead (CH3CH2)4Pb. The oxide of lead in its preferred oxidation state (PbO; +2) is amphoteric; it forms anionic plumbates in strongly basic solutions. Lead forms Zintl phases such as CsPb, Sr31Pb20, La5Pb3N and Yb3Pb20. It has reasonable to good corrosion resistance; in moist air it forms a mixed gray coating of oxide, carbonate and sulfate that hinders further oxidation.|$|E

40|$|Examination of {{car fleet}} records in Accra {{demonstrates}} an increasing proportion of catalytic converter-equipped {{cars in the}} relatively old car fleet (average age 13 years) due to their import from developed countries. However, only leaded petrol is sold in Ghana. Lead <b>anti-knocking</b> <b>additives,</b> which are known to affect catalyst activity and promote thermal sintering and mechanical abrasion, may increase Pt emissions. This possible synergism prompted the concomitant determination of Pb and Pt levels in road dust and roadside soils in Ghana. Both metals followed traffic density with higher concentrations in urban areas compared to remote sites. In urban areas, the range for Pb (365 ± 93 µg g 1 for dust and 291 ± 76 µg g 1 for soil) reflects pre-catalyst levels in Europe and the US, while the range for Pt (39 ± 24 ng g 1 for dust and 15 ± 5. 3 ng g 1 for soil) is typical for the same countries. The elevated Pt concentrations were unexpected due to recent introduction of catalysts to Ghana compared to the prolonged use of catalysts in Europe and the US...|$|R

40|$|Tetraethyllead (TEL) and tetramethyllead (TML) were {{produced}} world-wide as <b>anti-knocking</b> <b>additives</b> for gasoline to increase octane numbers. The use of leaded gasoline over almost one century caused an ubiquiteous pollution {{of the environment}} with lead ions or alkyllead compounds (Rhue et al. 1992). Nowadays, tertiär-butylether (Europe) or in future ethanol (U. S.) are used to increase the octane numbers. Whereas car emissions led to an ubiquiteous distribution of low concentrations of organolead compounds and in greater amounts of inorganic lead in the upper layers of soil, spillages of highly toxic tetraalkyllead (TAL) compounds during production, transportation or blending at oil refineries and petrol stations caused more severe soil and groundwater contaminations. The toxicity of alkyllead compounds decreases in the sequence: R 4 Pb> R 3 Pb+> R 2 Pb 2 + with R = -CH 3 or-C 2 H 5. Methylated lead species are less toxic than the ethylated compounds. In the atmosphere TAL is decomposed photocatalytically by UV irradiation, by ozone or by hydroxyl radicals to the more stable, water soluble ionic tri- and dialkylated species. Monoalkyllea...|$|R

Hale lichens were {{collected}} from the Pretoria central business district (CBD), as well as three sites {{to the east of}} Pretoria; the National Botanical Gardens, the CSIR campus and the suburb of Lynnwood, with the aim of utilising these lichens as biomonitors of air quality {{to determine the effects of}} the phasing out of leaded petrol and the simultaneous introduction of manganese <b>anti-knock</b> <b>additives</b> to fuel in South Africa. In addition to lichens, roadside dust and soil samples {{were collected}} from the CBD and CSIR campus, and all samples were analysed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry after acid digestion. There was no significant difference (95 % confidence) between the Mn content of lichens from all sampling sites (overall average of 97. 1 ± 39. 1 μg. g- 1, n= 28), which was most likely due to an even suspension of Mn-containing particles arising from soil dust. Additional contributions to Mn loading as a result of vehicle emissions were currently not evident. For all non-CBD sites, higher Pb levels were found in lichens which were nearer to busy roads, suggesting an historical impact by vehicular emissions of Pb arising from leaded petrol usage. The Pb concentrations in lichens found in the CBD (average of 181. 1 ± 98. 0 μg. g- 1, n= 10) were significantly higher (95 % confidence limits) than those of lichens growing outside of the CBD area (average of 41. 5 ± 36. 4 μg. g- 1, n= 18), and the Pb levels were higher than those of Mn, which was contrary to that found in sites outside the CBD...|$|R

Increasing compression ratio of spark ignition (SI) engines can improve fuel efficiency; however, engines with higher compression ratios {{are more likely}} to experience knock or pre-ignition, a potentially damaging phenomenon. One method to suppress knock is to use fuel additives; however, traditional organometallic additives like tetraethyl lead, while effective create toxic lead oxide nanoparticles. This study examined the hypothesis that organic polymer nanoparticles could be used as environmentally benign <b>anti-knock</b> <b>additives</b> by scavenging gas-phase radicals responsible for autoignition and then be consumed in the eventual combustion event. The organic polymer polycyclohexylethylene (PCHE) in n-heptane, a single component gasoline fuel surrogate, was experimentally investigated. To imitate fuel atomization and vaporization in a SI engine, a pneumatic atomizer was used to generate PCHE nanoparticles entrained in gaseous n-heptane and air mixtures. Liquid phase concentrations of 0. 01, 0. 05 and 0. 10 percent by weight PCHE in n-heptane were compared to n-heptane with no additive. Particle number as a function of diameter produced by the atomization process was quantified for each solution. In addition, the thermal stability and autoignition characteristics of the additive-doped fuels were examined using a laminar flow reactor. Results of the study showed that the pneumatic atomization process was able to successfully produce solid PCHE nanoparticles. Number of particles increased with additive concentration indicating that the PCHE was miscible in liquid n-heptane. Thermal degradation of the PCHE nanoparticles began when the reactor temperature reached approximately 775 ˚C. Although droplet evaporation produced PCHE nanoparticles in significant concentrations, the reactive experiments showed no difference in autoignition temperature between the additive-containing fuels and n-heptane alone. Although the central hypothesis of the study was not proven for PCHE particles, the same experimental design can be tested with other organic polymers...|$|R

Initially, his concerns were dismissed both by his fellow academics and by industrial interests. However, by the time of his death, only six countries had not outlawed leaded petrol, and the Royal Society of Chemistry gave him a silver medal in 1984 for his work in this area. He subsequently became convinced that the use of NPK fertilisers in agriculture resulted in a lack of the essential trace element, zinc in modern (particularly vegetarian) diets; his pioneering views were again widely dismissed, becoming mainstream years later.

40|$|The {{development}} {{of the quality of}} gasoline and diesel fuel has never been static. It is no longer newsworthy to say that the world of energy and chemical technology is changing fast. However, these changes are so fast that changes in related technology have to advance at the same speed. Consequently it has been a challenging time for analytical chemists in different types of laboratories involved in the analysis of automotive fuel, such as in the analysis of oxygenates in gasoline, to keep up with all the developments. Since gasoline testing is moving into the stage which requires more advanced technology, laboratories need to be equipped to utilise a range of different techniques in order to suit the peculiarities of the different nature of the samples. During the last few years, the volume of gasoline testing by different bodies such as the independent petroleum laboratories has increased. In practice, laboratories are under considerable pressure to implement the designated analytical regulatory methods, and to constantly improve analytical quality. To help resolve these issues, laboratories sometimes turn to instrument vendors for advice on methodological advances in this type of work. The author has been involved directly with the challenges of this work and has experienced the practical limitations of current methods. Therefore the author has aimed to evaluate various analytical approaches {{in the study of the}} characterisation of fuel blending additives and, in particular, oxygenates. This work starts out with an introduction about the {{development of}} automobile fuel technology and the use of <b>anti-knock</b> <b>additives</b> throughout the period from the early days to the present. Thereafter further chapters review the current methods applied for the characterisation of these type of fuel additives in gasoline, in particular high performance fuels as used in the motor racing industry. The main aim of this work is to evaluate the strengths and limitations of these methods. The thesis then includes a detailed discussion of different analytical approaches encompassing initially micro-elemental analysis for the direct determination of oxygen content. Then follows the most popular method, gas chromatography, which continues to be the key instrumental technique for the measurement of the main parameters of gasoline. Thereafter follows a study of the GC-MS technique. The next chapter discusses the combustion technique using a Laminar burner to investigate the effect of oxygenates on the reduction of the sooting tendency in diesel. The final method under discussion is the estimation of oxygenates using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. Each of the above methods has been used on similar types of samples in different categories. Thus the results may be compared and interpreted using the relevant tables, and correlated against each other. The final part of this work has therefore concentrated on the conclusion of the comparative advantages of each method and its reliability. The main samples used throughout this research work have been actual commercial conventional gasolines and specialised fuels. These have been evaluated against a set of reference standards...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 1999 With {{the advent}} of {{catalytic}} converters being placed in the exhaust systems of motor vehicles, {{in an attempt to}} reduce pollution, the use of tetra ethyl lead as an <b>anti-knock</b> <b>additive</b> to fuel was no longer acceptable. Lead is a poison for the exhaust catalysts used and so an alternative had to be found. At present the ethers, particularly methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), are being used as a substitute for lead. The limiting factor in the production of the ethers is the availability of isobutene. lsobutene may be produced using a number of complex processes and feedstocks. One route that has not been commercialised is the direct conversion of the linear butenes to isobutene via skeletal isomerisation. In the present study, using a specially constructed bench scale reactor system and a pilot plant, it was shown that an amorphous silica alumina catalyst could be used for the skeletal isomerisation of the n-butenes to isobutene. By investigating the effects of the residence time, n-butene partial pressure, total system pressure, system temperature and water to hydrocarbon molar ratio, a commercially suitable operating and regeneration procedure was developed. The effects of the various feed and product constituents, that build-up in the recycled hydrocarbon and process water streams, such as n-butane, isobutene, pentene, 1, 3 -butadiene and acetone, on the performance of the catalyst were also quantified. The long-term stability of the material, during repeated on-line and regeneration cycles, was determined. To allow the rigorous design of a commercial reactor, a suitable rate equation is required. Hence, a detailed kinetic investigation was conducted using the bench scale reactor system, the suitability of which for such a study was first investigated and confirmed. For the mono-molecular mechanism with either a single step or multiple steps controlling the overall reaction rate, and including the law of mass action, a total of eight cases were considered. Although the overall reaction mechanism could not be identified, a suitable rate equation was developed. The robustness of the rate equation was confirmed by its ability to predict accurately the performance of the pilot plant reactor system. Doctora...|$|E
30|$|Isoprene {{is a small}} {{volatile}} hydrophobic molecule containing five carbon {{atoms and}} {{is also known as}} 2 -methyl- 1, 3 -butadiene. It is a colorless organic compound that is produced by animals, plants and bacteria. It has a low solubility in water as well as a low boiling point of 34  °C which enables withdrawal from the upper gas phase of a bioreactor when produced via biotechnological processes (Xue and Ahring 2011). This aspect turns it valuable for downstream chemical products. Isoprene as biofuel contains more energy, is not miscible in water and does not show corrosive effects compared to ethanol (Atsumi and Liao 2008; Lindberg et al. 2010). Companies develop bioisoprene production such as Genencor and Goodyear, published their efforts to develop a gas-phase bioprocess for production of isoprene (Whited et al. 2010). Their work involved metabolic engineering of E. coli capable of producing high yields of isoprene, in addition to developing a large-scale fermentation process with high rates of the isoprene recovered from the off-gas. They reported a titer of over 60  g/L, a yield of 11 % isoprene from glucose and a volumetric productivity of 2  g/L/h (Chandran et al. 2011). Several researchers reported using isoprenol as anti-knock agent, in which branched C 5 alcohols store more energy than ethanol and high octane numbers (RON, or research octane number, of 92 – 102), that helps their use as gasoline alternatives and as <b>anti-knock</b> <b>additives</b> (Cann and Liao 2010; Mack et al. 2014). In addition, they have been verified in various engine types and they proved to have better gasoline-like properties than ethanol (Yang et al. 2010). All isoprenoids are known to be derived from the two universal five-carbon (C 5) building blocks, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). These universal precursors are known to be produced by either one of the three identified pathways: the mevalonate (MVA) pathway and/or the pathway, which is also 1 -deoxy-d-xylulose- 5 -phosphate (DXP) pathway. Additionally, an alternative MVA-independent pathway has been identified for the biosynthesis of IPP and DMAPP in bacteria, algae and plants which is named the methylerythritol 4 -phosphate (MEP) pathway and lacks the first two steps of the DXP pathway (Rodríguez-Concepción and Boronat 2012). Bacillus subtilis uses the DXP pathway and was found to be the best naturally isoprene producing bacteria (Kuzma et al. 1995). It is known that the isoprene synthase utilize dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) as substrate (Withers et al. 2007). The isoprene synthase gene was not identified in bacteria yet, however it has been characterized from many plants such as Populus species, e.g. aspen, Poplar Alba (Beatty et al. 2014; Fortunati et al. 2008; Miller et al. 2001; Sasaki et al. 2005; Sharkey et al. 2005; Silver and Fall 1995; Chotani et al. 2013; Vickers et al. 2010), Pueraria Montana (kudzu) and/or Pueraria lobata (Beatty et al. 2014; Hayashi et al. 2015; Sharkey et al. 2005). The isoprene synthase gene from poplar was successfully isolated and heterologously expressed in E. coli. Moreover, isoprene synthase cDNA was isolated from Populus alba (PaIspS) and expressed in E. coli for enzymatic characterization (Sasaki et al. 2005). Previous studies failed to isolate the isoprene synthase from bacteria (Julsing et al. 2007; Sivy et al. 2002), thus the Kudzu isoprene synthase gene (kIspS) was codon optimized and heterologously expressed in E. coli (Zurbriggen et al. 2012). Previously, the codon optimized Mucuna bracteata IspS was engineered in S. cerevisiae and it only produced 16.1  μg/L (Hayashi et al. 2015). Additionally, when the codon optimized M. bracteata IspS was engineered in Pantoea ananatis, it produced 63  μg/L (Hayashi et al. 2015). Recent studies involved in overexpression of codon optimized kudzu IspS (kIspS) in E. coli using different constructs (Cervin et al. 2016). The E. coli best isoprene production yield was 10  μg/L. In addition, the codon optimized kudzu and poplar IspS genes were expressed in Yarrowia lipolytica using different methods; in which the isoprene yield was 0.5 – 1.0  μg/L from the headspace culture (Cervin et al. 2016). This study aimed to develop recombinant Bacillus strains (B. subtilis and B. licheniformis) with high level of isoprene production using the Kudzu isoprene synthase.|$|R
