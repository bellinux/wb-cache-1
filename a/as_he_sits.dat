5|$|The season {{introduces}} Ted Mosby (voiced by Bob Saget) in {{the year}} 2030 <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> his daughter and son down {{to tell them the}} story of how he met their mother. The story begins in 2005 with Ted (Josh Radnor) as a single, 27-year-old architect living in Manhattan with his two best friends from college: Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student, and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher, who have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall proposes. Their engagement causes Ted to think about marriage and finding his soul mate, much to the disgust of his self-appointed best friend Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris). Ted begins his search for his perfect mate and meets an ambitious young reporter, Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), whom he quickly falls in love with. Robin, however, doesn't want to rush into a relationship and the two decide to be friends. Ted begins dating a baker, Victoria, but when she moves to Germany for a culinary fellowship, Ted leads Robin to believe that she broke up with him. As a result, Victoria breaks up with Ted and Robin begins to distance herself from him, though they eventually reconcile. As her wedding date approaches, Lily begins to wonder if she's missed any opportunities because of her relationship with Marshall and decides to pursue an art fellowship in San Francisco, breaking her engagement in the process. At the end of the season, Marshall is seen looking desolate and miserable, while Ted and Robin agree to pursue a relationship.|$|E

25|$|After breakfast, the Prince, {{accompanied}} by the playful Bendicò, goes into his office, which is lined with century-old paintings of the Salina family's estates. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> at his cluttered desk, the Prince recalls how much he dislikes both {{the room and the}} work it represents. This dislike intensifies during visits from his accountant and one of his tenants, both of whom are allied with the Redshirts. Both of them assure the Prince that the unification of Italy will be peaceful and will benefit everyone, including the nobility. The Prince allows himself to be reassured, certain that the class system will remain unchanged no matter what. The Prince's visit to the Salina chaplain, Father Pirrone, atop a tower where the men practice their joint hobby of astronomy, reinforces this belief.|$|E

500|$|Alberti opines that, {{rather than}} denying All in the Familys {{influence}} on The Simpsons, the series writers [...] "mockingly embrace it" [...] by having Homer visually likened to Bunker <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> on his chair. Alberti {{also noted that}} one of the security officer's use of the word [...] "pinko", a term used for a person who is regarded as sympathetic towards communism, is [...] "ironic" [...] as it was used by Bunker, whose chair Homer is sitting in. When the other officer complains about citizens [...] "hiding behind the Bill of Rights", Homer shields himself from the officers blows with the actual manuscript, making the officer's previous statement literal.|$|E

Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the Völsunga saga when the major goddess Frigg sends King Rerir an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger (in {{the guise of a}} crow) drops the apple in his lap <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> atop a mound.

500|$|Davidson notes a {{connection}} between apples and the Vanir, a group of gods associated with fertility in Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven [...] "golden apples" [...] being given to woo the beautiful Gerðr by Skírnir, who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god Freyr in stanzas 19 and 20 of Skírnismál. In Skírnismál, Gerðr mentions her brother's slayer in stanza 16, which Davidson states has led to some suggestions that Gerðr may have been connected to Iðunn as they are similar in this way. Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology; in chapter 2 of the Völsunga saga when the major goddess Frigg sends King Rerir an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger (in {{the guise of a}} crow) drops the apple in his lap <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> atop a mound.

500|$|Air story {{revolves}} around three girls {{whose lives are}} connected to the same man. In the first story arc, Dream, Yukito Kunisaki is a showman traveling across Japan, continuing his late mother's search for the [...] "girl in the sky".Translated quote: [...] "...at {{the far end of the}} sky, there is a girl who has wings...from the distant past...even now, she is still there. That is what I heard from my mother when I was small. Before I could ask more clearly, my mother died. After that, I continued journeying alone. The myth of the girl in the sky." [...] The story opens on Monday July 17, 2000 when Yukito comes across a small seaside town where the story takes place. On his first day in town, Yukito tries to earn money by putting on a mysterious puppet show where he manipulates a doll magically without strings for a small audience of kids passing by. Yukito is unsuccessful in gaining the children's favor, and the children leave without paying him for his performance. That night, Yukito sleeps on the town's seawall by the beach. Yukito collapses from heat stroke the next day and is taken to a nearby fisherman's guild; after he awakens, they feed him, and give him some very large rice balls to take with him as he is leaving. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> on the town's seawall eating one of the rice balls, he notices a young girl beside him who introduces herself as Misuzu Kamio—a sincere yet clumsy girl who is eager to become friends with him. Misuzu persistently attempts to play with him, while Yukito tries to refuse her efforts. He eventually follows her home lured by the chance to eat. After Haruko, Misuzu's aunt and foster mother, is persuaded, it is decided that he will stay with them for the time being.Translated quote: [...] "...I understand. Stay here.

2500|$|Episode eight {{ended the}} series with a {{generally}} positive critical reception, with many praising {{the performances of}} Tennant and Colman. Radio Times praised Tennant's performance, saying that [...] "the episode belonged to [...] ". They also heavily praised the ending to the Joe Miller case, labeling the resolution [...] "brilliant" [...] and claiming [...] "Yes, he got off, but writer Chris Chibnall and his fabulous cast fashioned a quite brilliant climax where justice of a sort was done". Digital Spy responded positively, labeling the finale [...] "satisfying and unsatisfying - complete closure has not been achieved. Reflecting the inequality and injustices of everyday life, Chibnall's choices for the finale were thoughtful, saddening and even worrying. A brave move, just as the entire two series have been". They also praised Tennant's performance, they said [...] "It's a cracking performance from the actor who delves deep to deliver some fiery moments but also, having solved the Sandbrook case, his own breakdown at the station - <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sits</b> alone and cries - is touching and deserved". The Independent, in a mixed review, praised many of the cast by saying [...] "Whenever the plot dragged, we could rely on Ellie (Olivia Colman), Beth (Jodie Whittaker) or Mark (Andrew Buchan) for a performance which delivered that missing emotional connection".|$|E

After his recovery from dysentery in Mexico, Sal returns to New York in the fall. He finds a girl, Laura, and plans to move with her to San Francisco. Sal writes to Dean about his plan to move to San Francisco. Dean writes back saying that he's willing to come and accompany Laura and Sal.

Sal's girlfriend Laura realizes this is a painful moment for Sal and prompts him for a response as the party drives off without Dean. Sal replies: [...] "He'll be alright".
