5|$|An astute {{politician}} {{deeply involved}} with power issues in each state, Lincoln {{reached out to}} the War Democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the 1864 presidential election.

On April 14, 1865, five days after the surrender of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth and died the next day. Lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as among the greatest U.S. presidents.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1826, the Canal Company had {{insufficient}} funds {{to complete the}} work, and a special meeting authorised the taking out of a mortgage to cover the £15,000 deficit. The canal was an obvious competitor to the River Tone Navigation, which was managed by the Conservators of the River Tone, a legal body created for that purpose by Act of Parliament in 1699. There was animosity between the Company and the Conservators, with the Company maintaining {{that they had a}} right to use the Tone to reach the centre of Taunton, and the Conservators maintaining that they did not. The canal was scheduled to be opened on 1 January 1827, but the opening was delayed until 3 January, as the connection to the River Tone was not made until 2 January. The opening celebrations were hampered by snow <b>and</b> <b>bitter</b> cold weather.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of 19 November, a {{thunderstorm}} followed by a drenching downpour broke over the opposing armies. In a few hours every wadi in the foothills and on the plain was in flood. The black soil plain, hard and firm during summer, became in these winter conditions sticky and heavy for marching and almost impassable for wheeled vehicles. The temperature, which had been hot {{during the day and}} pleasant at night, dropped rapidly to become piercingly cold. The infantrymen had been marching light in their summer uniform of twill shorts and tunics. With only one blanket (and/or a Greatcoat), this gear gave little protection from the driving rain <b>and</b> <b>bitter</b> chill.|$|E

5|$|Erythranthe species tend to {{concentrate}} sodium chloride and other salts absorbed from the soils {{in which they}} grow in their leaves and stem tissues.

Leaves can be used in salads and soups; flowers taste best before blooming. E. lutea has been used for cooking in Peru.|$|E
5|$|Himmler and Potthast confessed {{their love}} for each other at Christmastime in 1938. At first they tried to keep it platonic, but they fell into an adulterous {{relationship}}. Himmler's wife since 1928 and mother of their daughter, Margarete Himmler, found out about Himmler's relationship with Potthast at some time in February 1941. She felt humiliated <b>and</b> <b>bitter,</b> and Potthast's parents rejected the extramarital relationship. Potthast first took up residence in Grunewald and from 1943 she lived in Brückentin, near the estate of Oswald Pohl, because she was a friend of his wife, Eleonore. Lina Heydrich, wife of Himmler's right-hand man Reinhard Heydrich, and Gerda Bormann, spouse of Martin Bormann, were also counted among her friends. Later she lived in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria.|$|E
5|$|Poe {{traveled}} to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830. In October 1830, John Allan married {{his second wife}} Louisa Patterson. The marriage <b>and</b> <b>bitter</b> quarrels with Poe over the children born to Allan out of affairs led to the foster father finally disowning Poe. Poe decided to leave West Point by purposely getting court-martialed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross neglect of duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, or church. Poe tactically {{pleaded not guilty to}} induce dismissal, knowing that he would be found guilty.|$|E
60|$|In {{the fields}} {{only are the}} sours <b>and</b> <b>bitters</b> of Nature appreciated; just as the wood-chopper eats his meal in a sunny glade, {{in the middle of}} a winter day, with content, basks in a sunny ray there and dreams of summer in a degree of cold which, {{experienced}} in a chamber, would make a student miserable. They who are at work abroad are not cold, but rather it is they who sit shivering in houses. As with temperatures, so with flavors; as, with cold and heat, so with sour and sweet. This natural raciness, the sours <b>and</b> <b>bitters</b> which the diseased palate refuses, are the true condiments.|$|R
