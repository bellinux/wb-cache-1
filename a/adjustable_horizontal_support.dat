25|$|A lathe is an <b>adjustable</b> <b>horizontal</b> metal {{rail and}} a tool rest, between the {{material}} and the operator which accommodates the positioning of shaping tools. With wood, it is common practice to press and slide sandpaper against the still-spinning object after shaping it to smooth the surface.

5000|$|A power rack (also {{known as}} a power cage, squat cage or squat rack) {{is a piece of}} weight {{training}} equipment that functions as a mechanical spotter for free weight barbell exercises without the movement restrictions imposed by equipment such as the Smith machine. Its general design is four upright posts with two <b>adjustable</b> <b>horizontal</b> bar catches (also called [...] "supports" [...] or [...] "pins") on each side. Many power racks also have accessory attachments, such as a chin-up bar, pulldown cable attachment, or pegs for storing weight plates.|$|R

An <b>adjustable</b> <b>horizontal</b> metal rail - the tool rest - between {{the material and}} the operator accommodates the positioning of shaping tools, which are usually hand-held. After shaping, it is common practice to press and slide sandpaper against the still-spinning object to smooth the surface made with the metal shaping tools. The tool rest is usually removed during sanding, {{as it may be}} unsafe to have the operators hands between it and the spinning wood.|$|R
50|$|The tail {{surfaces}} consisted of one swept vertical surface {{and a pair}} of swept horizontal surfaces, which had zero camber. The <b>adjustable</b> <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer was attached to the sides of fuselage, at about the same height as the wing. The rudder top was made of a dielectric material, and served as a cover for the radio antenna. The airplane had a wide lower elongated fin with a rounded profile, and contained one pair of air brakes. Additional air brakes were on the lower middle part of the fuselage, at the roots of the wing leading edge.|$|R

The withdrawal roller has some major shortcomings: large size of the whole step by step motorreduction requiring a pneumatic mechanism for raising the profile of the rolls, rolls are striated to pull the bar mold, which leads to visible traces on the profile shot. The proposed system uses instead of rollers (they have smaller surface contact) tanks that have <b>adjustable</b> <b>horizontal</b> surface contact plane.

40|$|Two {{new designs}} for {{microfilm}} viewers are described. Both viewers are front projection viewers utilizing matte surface display screens. One viewer with an <b>adjustable</b> <b>horizontal</b> screen has a normal magnification rate and {{is mounted on}} a desk top. The other viewer has a high (4 x) magnification rate in a mini-theater configuration with remote microfiche positioning controls. The matte surface screen {{is believed to be}} an improvement over conventional screens. Both viewers utilize conventional projection optics to maintain image contrast in controlled lighting environments. Interference between the user and the projected light is virtually eliminated by oblique projection achieved by simple, practical techniques. A survey of users shows a marked preference for the mini-theater viewer over conventional near projection viewers. Two control modes for positioning microfiche were developed for the mini-theater viewer: a velLcity-control system and a position-contro...|$|R
40|$|TanDEM-X (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement) opens {{a new era}} {{in space}} borne radar remote sensing. A {{single-pass}} SAR-interferometer with adjustable baselines in across- and in along-track directions is formed by adding a second (TDX), almost identical spacecraft, to TerraSAR-X (TSX) and flying the two satellites in a closely controlled formation. TDX has SAR system parameters which are fully compatible with TSX, allowing not only independent operation from TSX in a mono-static mode, but also synchronized operation (e. g. in a bi-static mode). With typical across-track baselines of 200 - 400 m DEMs according to the High Resolution Terrain Information (HRTI) - 3 standard will be generated.

40|$|In {{historic}} buildings, {{a variety}} of different types of timber roof structures reflecting different building traditions and different ideals for the inner space are found. In Sweden, damage to historic roof structures {{due to a lack of}} <b>support</b> for <b>horizontal</b> thrust is common. Knowledge of the relation between structurally efficient <b>horizontal</b> <b>support</b> and the extension of a structure in space is essential for obtaining an adequate understanding of the development of building techniques and for making sound decisions concerning restoration. An approach that involves a classification of <b>horizontal</b> <b>supporting</b> structures, together with a mechanical model that defines and distinguishes between inner and outer support, is introduced, with the aim of offering a tool for comparison of different roof-truss designs with focus on the occupation in space. Comparison of the efficiency of different designs is carried out by comparing horizontal stiffness. Eleven different designs divided into four spatial groups have been analyzed. Â© 2008 ASCE...|$|R
40|$|The medieval timber roof {{structures}} {{hidden in}} the attics of many Swedish churches represent the advanced building technology of the time. They are an important cultural heritage, their being bearers of information from a period regarding which other direct sources of information are scarce. Understanding their structural action is {{necessary in order to}} be able to preserve them prop¬erly and also helps one better interpret their place in history. Timber roofs can be complex to analyse since they often possess a high degree of static inde¬terminacy, having several possible load paths. In analysing such a structure, the stiffness of its separate parts needs to be taken into account. Computa¬tional modelling by means of the finite element method (FEM) together with visualisation tools proposed for use here were found to be effective in analys¬ing their behaviour and in diagnosing damages that can occur. Many such damages can be attributed to weakness in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>support</b> of the roof structures involved. A mechanical model consisting of connected springs rep¬resenting the horizontal supportive stiffness of different parts of a building was developed. In addition, an approach that involves classifying the exten¬sion of <b>horizontal</b> <b>supports</b> for a roof structure in space was proposed. Both were used to analyse how the horizontal thrust is carried in existing buildings and to help develop new designs for <b>horizontal</b> <b>support.</b> Having access to the tools and methodologies proposed makes it possible to gain a better under¬standing of the structural behaviour of medieval roof struc¬tures, to compare different designs, to conceptualize new solutions, and facili¬tates collaboration between different professions in restoration work...|$|R
