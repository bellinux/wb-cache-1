To estimate the cost of an execution strategy, market impact must be added to the impact-free price. It is well worth stressing that attempts to estimate the cost of alternative schedules without impact adjustments are counter-productive: high urgency strategies would capture more liquidity near the decision time and therefore would always be preferred if one did not account for their impact.

Our main aim was to map the Lyman <b>alpha</b> <b>profiles</b> to learn about the gas kinematics and its relation with the escape of Lyman alpha photons and to detect extended Lyman alpha emission due to scattering in gaseous halos. We have combined our data with previously obtained UV spectroscopy on other three star-forming galaxies. We find that the P-Cygni profile is spatially extended, smooth and spans several kiloparsecs covering a region much larger than the starburst itself. We propose a scenario whereby an expanding super-shell is generated by the interaction of the combined stellar winds and supernova ejecta from the young starbursts, with an extended low density halo. The variety of observed Lyman <b>alpha</b> <b>profiles</b> both in our sample and in high redshift starbursts is explained as phases in the time evolution of the super-shell expanding into the disk and halo of the host galaxy. The observed shapes, widths and velocities are in excellent agreement with the super-shell scenario predictions and represent a time sequence.

Direct observations of the intrinsic flux of the Lyman alpha line (the dominant source of UV photons from low-mass stars) are challenging, as interstellar HI absorbs the entire line core for even the closest stars.

40|$|Several {{examples}} of weakenings of the C IV and N V resonance lines {{are found to}} coincide with the appearance of lambda 6678 dimples. The absence of variations in other UV lines and in the UV continuum at the same time or nearly the same time argues against dimples being caused by thermal variations from the underlying star. It is instead suggested that the resonance line weakenings are caused by non-LTE effects associated with the condensation of high density structures at some elevation over the star. A simple model of an opaque, essentially stationary slab which backscatters lambda 6678 line radiation into a surrounding 'penumbral' region is presented. Lambda 6678 photons are scattered a second time in this region back into the observer's line of sight and in the process acquire the local projected Doppler shift from rotation.

40|$|The N-galaxy 3 C 390. 3 {{has been}} {{monitored}} spectroscopically since 1974 (Osterbrock, Koski and Phillips 1975; Oke 1988). From various archives and literature, {{it is found}} that the Balmer lines change their intensities and profiles in a dramatic manner. The H <b>alpha</b> <b>profile</b> is very broad and peculiar, and the relative intensities of its two humps changes consistently with time, possibly periodically. Before 1980, the blue hump was significantly stronger than the one in the red. From 1980 to 1983 the blue hump became stronger (see Oke 1988). After 1983 the H <b>alpha</b> <b>profile</b> has returned to its early shape and seems to have completed a full circle. Unlike the rapid (on the order of a month or even less) and aperiodic variation in the continuum and integrated line intensities, the change in broad profile seems slow and consistent. Taking the analogy of cataclysmic variables, the double-horn profiles have been observed in cases of interacting stars. For example, the emission lines, both in He II and hydrogen Balmer lines in GD 552 (Stover 1985) show double-horn profiles and periodical changes in their line profiles, including the change in ratios of two humps. It is understood that the D-wave components (Smak 1976) are the signature of an emitting disk and the S-wave component is from the emission at a hot spot which rotates and results in a moving component in the velocity space. The mass flow from the nearby interacting star provides the stream toward the core of a neutron star or white dwarf. Therefore, it is proposed that the variation of broad line profiles observed in 3 C 390. 3 {{may be the result of}} a pair of interacting massive cores. The rotational velocity dominates and produces a variable double-horn profile. However, the line widths observed in broad line radio galaxies are one order larger than that in interacting stars. The Balmer decrements imply a much smaller density (10 (exp 10 - 12) cm(exp- 3)) than that in the cataclysmic variables. The much larger velocity and much thinner density make it unlikely that the broad line emission is simply formed in an accretion disk. The authors postulate that a significant rotational motion is involved. If the observed squared profiles are indeed due to the rotational velocity field, one can naturally explain their rare occurrence...|$|E

Modeling of the hydrogen column density with the minimum number of components yields D/H ~ 1. 5 x 10 E- 5.

A mass-loss rate of less than or similar to 10 (- 5) M. yr(- 1) is estimated from the H <b>alpha</b> <b>profile.</b> A new upper limit for the inclination of the system is derived which provides a lower limit to the (present) mass of Wray 977 (48 M.). Regarding current binary evolution scenarios, the empirical lower mass limit for black-hole formation in a binary increases to M(ZAMS) greater than or similar to 50 M. ...|$|E
40|$|I {{show that}} the Lyman alpha wings of cool dwarfs can be {{understood}} in terms of a very simple model, based on a simplified representation of the chromospheric hydrogen excitation balance and approximate analytic wing diagnostics in partial redistribution. Much of the complexity of the radiation transfer in the partially coherent and steeply temperature-sensitive Lyman alpha line is circumvented by this technique. The result is an expedient scheme for inverting the Lyman <b>alpha</b> wing <b>profile</b> to determine the characteristic free electron density and its gradient in the middle chromosphere. This represents an important new diagnostic for constraining chromospheric models and their radiative losses. I apply this diagnostic to the Lyman <b>alpha</b> wing <b>profiles</b> of the Sun and AU Mic and show that current instrumentation, most notably the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) on the Hubble Space Telescope, is capable of providing the necessary data...|$|R
40|$|Spectrographs of the H-alpha line {{taken at}} 15 second {{intervals}} from {{the event of}} 5 Sept. 1973 were interpreted by comparison with synthetic profiles. A sequence of 27 high resolution H <b>alpha</b> <b>profiles</b> {{was obtained from the}} second brightest flare kernel. The profiles were generally self reversed with a maximum peak intensity of 1. 16 x continuum and a maximum central intensity of. 91 x continuum. The line characteristics such as red and violet peak intensities and positions, center shifts and wing intensities were tabulated. Synthetic H-alpha profiles were generated from a finite layer assuming simple parameteric forms for the source function and velocity field. The velocity chosen always decreased with optical depth and had the same sign. For absorption profiles, bisector shifts were calculated for a variety of velocities. The velocity field and source function were derived as a function of optical depth and time...|$|R
40|$|Cold gas {{streaming}} {{along the}} dark-matter filaments {{of the cosmic}} web is predicted to be the major provider of resources for disc buildup, violent disk instability and star formation in massive galaxies in the early universe. We study to what extent these cold streams are traceable in the extended circum-galactic environment of galaxies via Ly alpha absorption and selected low ionisation metal absorption lines. We model the expected absorption signatures using high resolution zoom-in AMR cosmological simulations. In the postprocessing, we distinguish between self-shielded gas and unshielded gas. In the self-shielded gas, which is optically thick to Lyman continuum radiation, we assume pure collisional ionisation for species with an ionisation potential greater than 13. 6 eV. In the optically thin, unshielded gas these species are also photoionised by the meta-galactic radiation. In addition to absorption of radiation from background quasars, we compute the absorption line profiles of radiation emitted by the galaxy at {{the centre of the}} same halo. We predict the strength of the absorption signal for individual galaxies without stacking. We find that the Ly <b>alpha</b> absorption <b>profiles</b> produced by the streams are consistent with observations of absorption and emission Ly <b>alpha</b> <b>profiles</b> in high redshift galaxies. Due to the low metallicities in the streams, and their low covering factors, the metal absorption features are weak and difficult to detect.
