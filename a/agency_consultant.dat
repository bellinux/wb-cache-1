40|$|Mystery {{shopping}} {{has been}} used to objectively measure whether employees follow the visions of a company’s quality service standards. It then creates a feedback loop that allows companies to train their employees to consistently deliver quality services. The main purposes of this project are aimed at examining (1) the overall benefits of mystery shopper projects in the hospitality business through literature reviews; and (2) the importance of how a company can work with an outside <b>agency</b> (<b>consultant,</b> academic institution, etc.) to develop a mystery shopping program that can enhance and complement ongoing service quality programs. A casual steakhouse restaurant in the Eastern U. S. was selected as our pilot project. The basic concept of using secret shoppers is to have individuals experience real-time and onsite quality of services and record how the mystery shoppers felt about the quality of services and if the employees met or exceeded the company’s standards. For this reason, the authors believe that mystery shopping, especially in hospitality, is an important means of developing and maintaining a sustainable business. While the sustainability of a business is largely dependent upon “people, profits and planet” in the hospitality industry, it is also dependent upon meeting service standards and developing a feedback loop. Mystery shopping programs have demonstrated their ability to contribute to organizations in this regard...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Zajac and Westphal (1995; 2004) {{found that}} US {{companies}} have transitioned from corporate (or managerial) to agency (or shareholder) logic. This study examines the institutional logic embedded with New Zealand’s discourse on executive remuneration, {{and how it}} influences the decision-making of remuneration committees. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected from 33 semi-structured interviews with 5 executives, 16 non-executive directors, 7 consultants, and 5 representatives of issuers (who produce codes of best practice). The interviews focused on executive remuneration in New Zealand publicly listed companies. Findings: Non-executive directors draw on a multitude of rationales to justify or legitimise their decisions regarding executive remuneration. The rationales include: <b>agency,</b> <b>consultant,</b> fairness, human resources, market, motivation, pay-for-performance, and responsibility. However, the market rationale dominated the discourse on executive remuneration. The majority of non-executive directors, executives, and consultants interviewed argued that one executive’s remuneration should be comparable to another executive’s remuneration. Research limitations/implications: Both the agency and corporate logics have been institutionalised in New Zealand. However, the dominant remuneration rationales fit with the corporate logic, rather than the agency logic. Practical implications: As the remuneration rationales are taken-for-granted they offer non-executive directors considerable flexibility in deciding how {{and how much to}} remunerate executives. Shareholders and regulators {{need to be aware of}} this flexibility. Originality/value: This study develops and tests a theoretical framework for understanding how institutional logics can influence organisational decision-making. Type: Research pape...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study on}} the outcome of the Swedish Forest Agency´s mission to provide {{individual}} advice to private land owners about precommercial thinning. The study was conducted in Sala municipality and included forest owners that had received private individual advice from a Swedish Forest <b>Agency</b> <b>consultant</b> as well as forest owners that had not received individual advice. One of the central issues was to make comparisons between these two groups. The survey was carried out by telephone interviews combined with a smaller field study. The questions were designed to provide information about to what degree the forest owners had been affected by the advice and {{if there had been a}} change in the way in which precommercial thinning was performed. In terms of the amount of precommercial thinning that had been carried out, no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups. The field study indicated that in some cases less precommerical thinning had been performed in the field than originally stated by the property owner. Additional information obtained during the telephone survey indicated that the private individual advice had influenced forest owners in terms of how they performed precommercial thinning. Despite no statistically significant differences between the two studied groups regarding the amount of precommercial thinning performed, several forest owners answered that they would not have carried out their precommercial thinning operations at all if they had not been contacted and offered private individual advice...|$|E

40|$|Purpose-The {{reconstruction}} of road infrastructure in the post-disaster context require different approach {{when compared with}} road projects in the normal development context. Disaster recovery projects are seen as having their own unique identity, particularly due to stakeholder issues, resource challenges, capability issues, and even long-term reliability concerns. This paper invites a discussion regarding the challenges and obstacles identified in the {{reconstruction of}} road infrastructure in a post-disaster reconstruction setting, and focuses the discussion on the pre-construction phase. Design/ Methodology/ Approach - The challenges and obstacles {{presented in this paper}} are based on the literature and the empirical evidence collected from the research in three case study districts in Aceh, Indonesia. Twenty-eight face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with stakeholders of road infrastructure at the local, provincial and national level, and represented by respondents from the public works, planning agency, disaster management <b>agency,</b> <b>consultant,</b> contractors, and donor agencies. The findings were triangulated with the literature and consulted with five experts in the road infrastructure and disaster reconstruction area. Findings - The identified challenges and obstacles are divided into three groups of discussion; planning and programming, road design, and procurement. Whilst some of these challenges are not unique to post-disaster context, the scale of the risks had been undermined. Originality/ value - This paper identifies the challenges and obstacles of a road project in the post-disaster setting from the pre-construction perspective. Identification of these challenges and obstacles may help improve the implementation of post-disaster road infrastructure reconstruction projects in future recovery projects, particularly in the developing world...|$|E

40|$|Contemporary {{literature}} on intermediary organisations {{does not cover}} the history of these organisations {{in the early twentieth}} century or how their roles evolved. To understand the evolution of roles, this paper extends the application of dynamic capabilities theory from firms to intermediary organisations. It does this by studying a Dutch government innovation agency between 1910 and 1940 with dynamic capabilities in mediation and knowledge development. These capabilities are illustrated by nine examples that reveal how the <b>agency’s</b> <b>consultants</b> modified and extended their resource base in order to continue supporting small and medium-sized enterprises while coping with considerable challenges and changes. Thereby, this paper shows that the dynamic capabilities theory can explain how intermediary organisations can adapt their roles...|$|R

Specifically, we highlight the primacy of logics and identities in discursive practice by exploring how a wide range of stakeholders conceptualise and understand PR in Chinese cultural contexts. We employed forty semi-structured interviews with PR <b>agency</b> <b>consultants,</b> in-house PR practitioners, media journalists and industry regulators. We have found that each group of stakeholders tend to interpret Chinese PR in relation to their identities. The established cultural contexts also serve as a “repertoire” for stakeholders to draw institutional logics and legitimise their interpretation of PR practice in China...|$|R

In conducting 40 semi-structured interviews with PR <b>agency</b> <b>consultants,</b> in-house PR practitioners, media journalists and industry association officers, the authors have found multiple and competing logics within the field that, in turn, confer reconciled identities upon Chinese PR. The Chinese cultural contexts serve as a repertoire for stakeholders to draw institutional logics and legitimize their interpretations of PR practice in China...|$|R

40|$|Our {{research}} aims {{to answer}} the research questions “How do we commonly describe the global start-ups profile as evidenced in prior inductive research?” and “Does this global start-ups profile can effectively explain phenomena in Australian global start-up firms?” We systematically review 29 global start-ups (144 firms) qualitative articles to understand descriptive definitions of global-startup firms. We then triangulate this finding with an Australian high-tech firm. Our contribution is to form a descriptive profile of global start-up phenomenon and raise interesting issues that have potentially fruitful findings for both research and practice. This profile might well be just a deviant from the traditional model that describes how firms establish their footprints, first in their domestic markets followed by moves into cross-border activities. Regardless, government <b>agencies,</b> <b>consultants,</b> and entrepreneurs {{need to understand the}} phenomenon. Thus we anticipate that this phenomenon will continue to provide interesting issues for pursuit, both by researchers as well as the practitioner community...|$|R
