50|$|During the {{construction}} of the Verbindungsbahn section underneath tracks 1 through 3 of the Hauptbahnhof, no more than one main line track was scheduled to be taken out of service at any time. For this reason, a makeshift platform was constructed at the north-westerly track 1a, and the excavation pit was split lengthwise into two lateral pieces. Construction was done utilizing the cut-and-cover top-down method, where the outer shell was made up of a 28-metre-deep bored pile wall, on top of which the roof structure of the tunnel was built. The tracks and platforms where then reconstructed on this tunnel roof by May 1974, which meant the complete resumption of main line traffic. Underneath the roof structure, space was then excavated from the top down, and the inner shell was constructed, consisting of a floor and inner walls, which carried the roofs of up to three internal levels. On the topmost internal level, an underground parking garage with 120 spaces was built, which doubled as a civilian shelter, secure against <b>airborne</b> <b>agents,</b> such as poison gas, and nuclear attack, with a capacity for 4,500 persons. The inner shell was completed at the end of 1975.|$|E

The test media {{is sold in}} a tubing glass bottle which may break if dropped or weakened in shipment to the laboratory. Because mycobacteria is a very infectious <b>airborne</b> <b>agent,</b> there is concern in the marketplace that the potential for breakage of glass bottles places the laboratory technician and environment at risk. While tests {{are under way to}} identify a plastic bottle suitable for this application, Organon Teknika is pursuing the use of a heat shrink sleeve as an option to improve the safety of this product. This study addresses the feasibility of using a heat shrink sleeve as a safety mechanism by comparing bottles with sleeves to bottles without sleeves. While the PVC sleeve will not eliminate bottle breakage, tests have shown that this sleeve can reduce the likelihood of glass and liquid scatter in the case of bottle breakage. In light of these results, Organon Teknika has implemented the use of the heat shrink sleeve on the MB/BacT Process Bottles...|$|R

40|$|Elite athletes, {{particularly}} those engaged in endurance sports and those exposed chronically to airborne pollutants/irritants or allergens, are {{at increased risk}} for upper and lower airway dysfunction. Airway epithelial injury may be caused by dehydration and physical stress applied to the airways during severe exercise hyperpnoea and/or by inhalation of noxious agents. This is thought to initiate an inflammatory cascade/repair process that, ultimately, could lead to airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and asthma in susceptible athletes. The authors review the evidence relating to prevention or reduction of the risk of AHR/asthma development. Appropriate measures should be implemented when athletes exercise strenuously in an attempt to attenuate the dehydration stress and reduce the exposure to noxious <b>airborne</b> <b>agents.</b> Environmental interventions are the most important. Non-pharmacological strategies can assist, but currently, pharmacological measures have not been demonstrated to be effective.

40|$|Environmental {{exposures}} to very {{low levels of}} airborne chemicals are associated with adverse symptoms, often affecting multiple organ systems, in the phenomenon of chemical sensitivity (CS). Recent surveys suggest a significant prevalence of chemically sensitive subjects in the United States, but the mechanism linking exposure to symptoms remains unclear, despite the advancement {{of a variety of}} theoretical models. In many of these models, exposure of the nasal respiratory system to an <b>airborne</b> <b>agent</b> {{is the first step in}} the pathway leading to symptoms. In this article, we advance the hypothesis that interactions between environmental chemicals and the vomeronasal organ (VNO) may play a role in the etiology of CS. The VNO, a bilateral, tubular organ located in the nose, serves in animals as part of a sensitive chemosensory system; however, evidence suggesting that the VNO retains a functional role in the adult human is controversial. Reported characteristics of the human VNO relevant to CS, including location, prevalence, selective sensitivity to airborne chemical exposure, and capacity to produce systemic effects, are discussed within the context of this ongoing debate. Beyond relevance to CS, the demonstration of an active, adult VNO could have significant impact on environmental toxicology.

40|$|The {{toxicology}} of CO is {{very well}} known to alter oxygen saturation in red blood cells, but only at concentrations that are far above those observed in England during the time period 1996 – 2004. Exposure to CO at the current criterion concentration (9 ppm) pro-duces carboxyhaemoglobin of only about 1. 4 – 2. 0 %, which is clinically insignificant. Hence, I find it less than plausible that the very low ambient levels of CO in England could be the direct cause of so many deaths from respiratory disease. I can present an alternative hypothesis to explain these pollutant–mortality correla-tions. I have argued 3 {{that the use of}} methyl ether (such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) or tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME)) in gasoline creates MN in the exhaust. As CO is primarily an engine exhaust product, increased CO would be expected to be strongly correlated with MN exhaust.

To investigate the dynamical behaviour of theoretically released particles from a moving ATV, the open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software OpenFOAM was {{used to calculate the}} external and internal air flow fields with passive and forced ventilated openings of a common ATV moving at a speed of 80 km/h. In addition to a computed flow rate of approximately 40, 000 m 3 /h crossing the interior of the ATV, the visualization of the trajectories has demonstrated distinct patterns of the spatial distribution of potentially released bioaerosols {{in the vicinity of the}} ATV. Although the front openings show the highest air flow to the outside, the recirculations of air masses between the interior of the ATV and the atmosphere also occur, which complicate the emission and the dispersion characterizations.

Our work was part of the MAPEC (Monitoring Air Pollution Effects on Children for supporting public health policy) project, a multicentric cohort study that involves 1, 000 primary school children (6 - 8 years old) in 5 Italian cities (Brescia, Lecce, Perugia, Pisa and Turin), with different degrees of pollution.

These relationships are complex and highly variable, depending on local conditions. Dust, allergens, soot, water vapor, and other particles and gases in the atmosphere are constantly interacting and forming new mixtures, often with the influence of heat and ultraviolet radiation. Many direct human health effects of these <b>airborne</b> <b>agents</b> have been well characterized. Some of these agents also have greenhouse properties, contributing to the overall warming of the planet, while others impart cooling effects. Climate change and air pollution are thus inextricably intertwined.

A Portable Isolated Unit-Containment and Protection System Utilizing Life Support (PIU-CAPSULS) is a specially designed unit created in order to provide a controlled containment and comfort environment for a patient. It is used in cases involving chemical and biological contaminants or catastrophic events in civilian, commercial or military environments where the person may be infected or contaminated with an <b>airborne</b> <b>agent</b> such as nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC). This unit protects the patient from the external environment and helps to maintain comfortable conditions by preventing particulate (biological and radiological) cross-contamination between the human body (patient) and the surroundings. Providing individual casualty protection and maintaining comfortable conditions are complex concepts which take into account various aspects pertaining to sensorial, psychological and physiological concepts. Several factors such as temperature, air velocity and humidity along with human respiratory and thermal systems that regulate the consumption of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide and metabolic heat generation are to be considered. Apart from these, fluid flow, heat and mass transport also are an important part in the balance and distribution of heat and gas species within the unit. In this study a three-dimensional CFD-based simulation model has been developed using ANSYS/Fluent commercial code to analyze the rate of heat and mass transport between the human body in an isolation unit and the environment.
