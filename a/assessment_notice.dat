5000|$|The {{toll rate}} on E-470 for {{vehicles}} {{that do not}} have ExpressToll automated toll transponders, roughly , is one of the highest rates of any toll road in the United States. In addition to 17 ramp toll interchanges, there are five mainline toll stations along the 47 mi route and the average non-discounted toll to pass each mainline station is $3.64 based on 2017 rates posted on E-470.com. According to the E-470's 2017 Toll Calculator [...] traveling {{the entire length of the}} road from I-25 in the north to I-25 in the south (or vice versa) costs $14.50 for ExpressToll customers, and $18.20 for those without a transponder. Drivers with ExpressToll accounts, E-470's automated toll collection service, and transponders mounted on their vehicle save 20% on posted toll rates along E-470.The toll stations no longer accept cash; E-470 was one of the first highways in the United States to implement full highway-speed electronic tolling. Regarding License Plate Toll (for vehicles without ExpressToll transponders), cameras at each station photograph the front and rear license plate of each vehicle. A bill is mailed after approximately 30 days to the registered owner of the vehicle in accordance with state law. The License Plate Toll statement must be paid in full by the due date or a second statement with a one-time $5 late fee will be mailed. If payment is still not received, a third statement is sent with no additional fees. If the account remains unpaid for more than 90 days, the account becomes delinquent and all overdue toll transactions will be sent to a collections law firm for up to four months in an attempt to find the customer and collect payment. The unpaid tolls, the $5 late fee, and a one-time $20 collection fee are due at this time. If payment is still not received, a Civil Penalty <b>Assessment</b> <b>Notice</b> will be mailed for the unpaid tolls, the $5 late fee, the $20 collection fee, and a $25 Civil Penalty per notice. Upon receipt of this document, the customer may request a hearing.

40|$|This {{pamphlet}} aims {{to provide}} detailed coverage of where Australian tax dollars are spent. Overview Taxation is imposed through the coercive {{power of the}} state. Politicians often speak of “asking” taxpayers to pay more {{of this or that}} tax, but in reality they can and do tell citizens what to pay. It is vital to the functioning of democracy that voters know what their taxes are paying for. Often they don’t, because the information is not readily available to them. This year, for the first time, the federal government will provide a ‘tax receipt’ with each taxpayer’s <b>assessment</b> <b>notice,</b> showing how the individual’s personal income tax payment was spent in 2013 / 14. This is a step forward, but because it is limited to personal income tax it provides an incomplete coverage of taxation and government expenditure.

40|$|Extract] A uniform code - in Pt IVC of the TAA (ss 14 ZL to 14 ZZS) - {{governs the}} {{procedures}} for challenging a taxation decision made under various Commonwealth Tax Acts, including the ITAA 1997, ITAA 1936, TAA and FBTAA. The uniform code applies where an Act or Regulations provide {{that a person}} or entity "dissatisfied with" an <b>assessment,</b> determination, <b>notice</b> or decision or with a failure to make a private ruling may object against it in accordance with Pt IVC: s 14 ZL(1). For example, s 175 A of ITAA 1936 gives a taxpayer the right to object against an income tax assessment. A GST assessment is reviewable under Pt IVC: see s 105 - 40 Pt 3 - 10 Sch 1 TAA. The expression "dissatisfied with" is not defined in Pt IVC, {{but it seems that}} it means more than its ordinary dictionary meaning of "displeased with" and that an entity cannot object against a taxation decision unless the decision has legal effect in relation to that entity: see CTC Resources NL v FCT (1994) 27 ATR 403 at 414, 435. A mere curiosity or interest in the decision will not suffice. Importantly the Pt IVC system applies not only to assessments but also to a range of other decisions which the Commissioner may make under the various taxing Acts. Part IVC is based on the concept of the "taxation decision", which is defined in s 14 ZQ: [RL 1 / 2520 - 10]. The expression means any <b>assessment,</b> determination, <b>notice</b> or decision against which a "taxation objection" may be made; that is, any <b>assessment,</b> determination, <b>notice</b> or decision which the Commissioner may make under a taxing Act, and which that taxing Act provides may be objected against in the manner set out in Pt IVC. It includes a private ruling made under Div 359 of Schedule 1 TAA (per s 359 - 60) but not a public ruling made under Div 358. Each taxing Act now contains provisions which allow persons affected by certain <b>assessments,</b> determinations, <b>notices,</b> and decisions made under that Act to "object [...] . in the manner set out in Part IVC 1953 ". The objection is referred to as a "taxation objection": s 14 ZL(2) [RL 1 / 2505]. If two or more taxation decisions are notified in the one notice, they are treated as one decision for Pt IVC purposes, except to the extent that a decision consists of an ineligible income tax remission decision - that is taken to be a separate objection decision for the purposes of any review or appeal: s 14 ZR [RL 1 / 2530]...|$|R

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the condition of}} drivers regarding traffic education, which, throughout the ages, has become chaotic due to failures in the transit system. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the records of traffic infraction against owners and drivers of vehicles and found the allegations in the suits filed by them to justify the violation in order to verify that led them to circumvent the law and therefore suggest that measures act directly on the point that pushes you to disobey the law, which often entails risks to other users of the transit system. The current transit system is flawed, both by population and by the government, which in many cases is absent or ineffective. The methodology used for conducting this study was analytical research involving literature review and documentary, and also interviewed with the chief of transit in southeastern Brazil, with the police and the deputy chairman of the Joint Administrative Appeals against infractions. With the analysis made in the tax <b>assessment</b> <b>notices</b> Transit and resources, we could identify most of the offenses committed, and also found that the inconsistent claims have litigated in the appeals. It was possible to realize also that traffic education is not as even touches the driver as it should, it is notable that despite being aware of legislation often the driver commits the offense knowingly. Education is not only to educate the population, but to make her obey and respect the law is necessary to invest more in that area, since all are users of the transit system...|$|R

40|$|One area of {{procedure}} encompassed by the topic, Tax Administration, is the statutory assessment. It is {{that area of}} Tax Administration to which this thesis is directed. The making of an income tax assessment is probably {{to be regarded as}} the primary function of the Commissioner of Taxation under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Almost every action and procedure undertaken by the Commissioner has some relationship to his duty to make assessments. The assessment-making procedure, which is fundamental (in the scheme of the Act) to the creation of an enforceable obligation to pay income tax, includes a process of applying the provisions of the Act to a state of facts with a view to determining the liability of the taxpayer concerned. The nature of the assessment is discussed by reference to the statutory provisions which authorise the making of and objection to an assessment. The thesis proceeds by way of examination of the following topics: the <b>assessment,</b> the <b>notice</b> of <b>assessment,</b> validity in procedure and "assessment", authority to make an assessment, amended assessment, right to challenge an assessment. (The final chapter considers the assessment {{in the context of the}} review procedure of Part V of the Income Tax Assessment Act). A theme of the thesis is that the Income Tax Assessment Act is concerned only with a valid assessment, that is, one made intra vires, and further, that not every assessment-like calculation or determination is the assessment contemplated by the Act. Thus, if the requirements of "assessment" are not satisfied then there is no "assessment" even though there is jurisdiction to assess in the particular circumstances. Where there is jurisdiction to assess then any assessment made will be a valid assessment, and this notwithstanding any identifiable mala fides or impropriety on the part of the Commissioner of Taxation or his delegate which is associated with the making of that assessment.

40|$|AbstractStudent Centered Learning is a {{very popular}} {{principle}} amongst European educational policies and Higher Education organizational regulation, but is there really a question risen on which are the students’ interest or educational desires? According to recent studies, students often expect to understand issues related to real life problems, they expect teachers who will help them learn and {{have a positive impact}} on their way of thinking and feeling about themselves and the world. Also, in the European economical context, students expect from their university social and professional opportunities and guidance in finding a job and building a career. The problem is that taking a closer look to formal regulations, and there are plenty of them (quality assurance regulations, internal evaluation regulations, international <b>assessments),</b> we might <b>notice</b> a gap between normative objectives and students expectations. In this paper I will focus on regulations and students expectations regarding teachers’ assessment in the Romanian Higher Education System.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the level of}} depression in diabetic patients and investigate {{the effect of a}} counseling program on the level of depression. Methods: A pre-post experimental study was conducted at the outpatient medical clinics of the Health Insurance Hospital affiliated to the Ministry of Health, Mansoura, Egypt. The study was carried out between June 2011 and September 2011. One hundred and twenty type II diabetic patients were recruited in this study. We used 2 tools for data collection: a) A structured interview questionnaire including socio-demographic and disease related data. b) The Zung self-rating depression scale. We classified the subjects into 2 equal groups of 60 patients each (group A - control and group B - experimental). Both groups were interviewed after 3 months to assess the level of depression. Results: On initial assessment, depression was found in approximately 57. 5 % of the control group, and severe depression in 32. 5 %. On second assessment, the depression rate in the control group increased to 67. 5 %, while the severe depression rate decreased to 25 %. In the experimental group, at initial <b>assessment,</b> it was <b>noticed</b> that the percentage of subjects with no depressions increase to be 39. 7 % instead of 27 %, also, the level of mild and severe depression decrease to be 56. 1 % post assessment instead of 58. 4 % and 14. 6 %.

A second oil release occurred on December 1, 2010 when a block valve associated with the same Chevron pipeline in close proximity to the first release failed. Fortunately, this crude oil did not enter Red Butte Creek. DWQ issued NOV I 10 - 05 to CPL for this second incident on January 19, 2011. Clean-up efforts were completed for this release and DWQ subsequently issued a close out letter dated March 22, 2012 formally closing out NOV I 10 - 05. Background On June 10, 2010, approximately 800 barrels (36, 600 gallons) of crude oil from a Chevron pipeline that crosses Red Butte Creek near the mouth of Red Butte Canyon was released with {{a large portion of the}} oil entering Red Butte Creek. Clean-up actions primarily by CPL, over the next months removed approximately 778 barrels (32, 676 gallons) from the creek. Monitoring efforts conducted jointly by the DEQ DWQ and Chevron’s contractor EarthFax, have been ongoing since the spill occurred and have evaluated water, sediment and bank soils, and macro-invertebrates in Red Butte Creek, and associated risks. Personnel from Salt Lake City Corporation and Salt Lake Valley Health Department also participated in evaluating potential impacts to human health and environment from the spill. Up until July 29, 2010, personnel from EPA Region 8 and federal contractors also actively participated in evaluation of and response to the spill. All of the analytical results from the monitoring program are available on the Red Butte website hosted by DWQ.
