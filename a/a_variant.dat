40|$|In {{this study}} we aimed to {{determine}} the effect of WNT 10 <b>A</b> <b>variants</b> on dental development in patients with oligodontia. Forty-three (25 boys and 18 girls) individuals were eligible for this study. Stage of development for each present tooth was assessed using the Demirjian method. In case no corresponding tooth was present, regression equations were applied for dental age to be calculated. The ratio between length of root and length of crown was ascertained for each present tooth in all quadrants. All patients were physically examined by a clinical geneticist and DNA analysis of the WNT 10 A gene was performed. Linear regression models were applied to analyze the association between WNT 10 <b>A</b> <b>variants</b> and dental age. The same analysis was applied to study the association between WNT 10 <b>A</b> <b>variants</b> and root elongation for each present tooth. One ordinal regression model was applied to analyze the association between WNT 10 <b>A</b> <b>variants</b> and development of present maxillary and mandibular teeth. Thirty-six (84 %) patients were detected with WNT 10 <b>A</b> <b>variants</b> of which six patients displayed evident ectodermal features. Dental age was 1. 50 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : - 2. 59, - 0. 42) to 1. 96 (95 % CI: - 3. 76, - 0. 17) years lower in patients with WNT 10 <b>A</b> <b>variants</b> compared with patients without variants. The development of maxillary canine, maxillary second molar and mandibular second molar was statistically significantly delayed in patients with WNT 10 <b>A</b> <b>variants</b> compared with patients without variants. The impact of WNT 10 <b>A</b> <b>variants</b> on dental development increases with presence of the nonsense c. (321 C>A p. (C 107 *)) variant and the number of missing teeth...|$|R

40|$|SMC 1 A encodes {{one of the}} {{proteins}} of the cohesin complex. SMC 1 <b>A</b> <b>variants</b> are known to cause a phenotype resembling Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS). Exome sequencing has allowed recognizing SMC 1 <b>A</b> <b>variants</b> in individuals with encephalopathy with epilepsy who do not resemble CdLS. We performed an international, interdisciplinary study on 51 individuals with SMC 1 <b>A</b> <b>variants</b> for physical and behavioral characteristics, and compare results to those in 67 individuals with NIPBL variants. For the Netherlands all known individuals with SMC 1 <b>A</b> <b>variants</b> were studied, both with and without CdLS phenotype. Individuals with SMC 1 <b>A</b> <b>variants</b> can resemble CdLS, but manifestations are less marked compared to individuals with NIPBL variants: growth is less disturbed, facial signs are less marked (except for periocular signs and thin upper vermillion), there are no major limb anomalies, {{and they have a}} higher level of cognitive and adaptive functioning. Self-injurious behavior is more frequent and more severe in the NIPBL group. In the Dutch group 5 of 13 individuals (all females) had a phenotype that shows a remarkable resemblance to Rett syndrome: epileptic encephalopathy, severe or profound intellectual disability, stereotypic movements, and (in some) regression. Their missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations are evenly spread over the gene. We conclude that SMC 1 <b>A</b> <b>variants</b> can result in a phenotype resembling CdLS and a phenotype resembling Rett syndrome. Resemblances between the SMC 1 A group and the NIPBL group suggest that a disturbed cohesin function contributes to the phenotype, but differences between these groups may also be explained by other underlying mechanisms such as moonlighting of the cohesin gene...|$|R

40|$|Phosphorylation {{of wheat}} (Triticum aestivum) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) H 2 <b>A</b> histone <b>variants</b> was {{examined}} during early seedling growth. The C-terminal regions of wheat H 2 <b>A</b> <b>variants</b> contain multiple S-P tetrapeptides (serine-proline {{adjacent to a}} pair of basic amino acids) which resemble known phosphorylation sites in histones from other species. Phosphorylation of nucleosomal core histones was assessed by autoradiography of proteins labeled in vivo with 32 Pi and resolved by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and phosphorylation sites were mapped by cleaving in vivo labeled H 2 <b>A</b> <b>variants</b> with N-bromosuccinimide. Essentially all phosphorylation of nucleosomal core histones in wheat and alfalfa seedlings occurred within the C-terminal peptides obtained from wheat and alfalfa H 2 <b>A</b> <b>variants.</b> <b>A</b> hypothesis accounting for the presence of large H 2 A and H 2 B histone variants in plants and phosphorylation of plant H 2 A C-terminal regions is proposed.

40|$|A {{total of}} 41 blood samples were {{collected}} from 40 Anaplasma phagocytophila-infected sheep in 11 sheep flocks from four different counties of southern Norway. The presence {{and nature of the}} Anaplasma species were identified by microscopic detection of morulae, PCR, reverse line blot hybridization, and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. A. phagocytophila was identified in all of the samples, and sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene revealed the presence of four <b>variants</b> of <b>A.</b> phagocytophila. Two of these variants have been described before, but two were newly identified 16 S rRNA variants of this species. <b>A.</b> phagocytophila <b>variant</b> 1 was found in nine flocks, <b>A.</b> phagocytophila <b>variant</b> 2 was found in four flocks, the A. phagocytophila prototype was found in two flocks, and <b>A.</b> phagocytophila <b>variant</b> 5 was found in one flock. In two flocks, some sheep were infected with <b>A.</b> phagocytophila <b>variant</b> 1, whereas others were infected with <b>A.</b> phagocytophila <b>variant</b> 2, and in three animals a double infection with two variants was registered.
