His chronicler opines that it was a letter that must have moved a stone to tears. And, moreover, it was not a mere matter of passionate protestations of innocence, or of unsupported accusation of his brother. It told her of the existence of proofs that must dispel all doubt. It told her of that parchment indited by Master Baine and witnessed by the parson, which document was to be delivered to her together with the letter. Further, it bade her seek confirmation of that document's genuineness, did she doubt it, at the hands of Master Baine himself. That done, it besought her to lay the whole matter before the Queen, and thus secure him faculty to return to England and immunity from any consequences of his subsequent regenade act to which his sufferings had driven him. He loaded the young Cornishman with gifts, gave him that letter to deliver in person, and added instructions that should enable him to find the document he was to deliver with it. That precious parchment had been left between the leaves of an old book on falconry in the library at Penarrow, where it would probably be found still undisturbed since his brother would not suspect its presence and was himself no scholar.

40|$|Abstract—This paper studies an {{evolutionary}} algorithm {{to solve a}} new multiobjective optimization problem (MOP), the Probabilistic Traveling Salesperson Problem with Profits (pT-SPP), which has noisy objective functions. As a variant of TSP, many real-world noisy MOPs {{can be reduced to}} pTSPP. The proposed algorithm leverages a novel noise-aware dominance operator, called the α-dominance operator. The operator statistically estimates the impacts of noise on objective functions and judges which solution candidates are superior/inferior to the others. Unlike existing noise-aware dominance operators, the α-dominance operator assumes no noise distributions. Thus, it is well applicable to various real-world noisy MOPs that follow unknown noise distributions. Experimental results show that the α-dominance operator effectively reveals the dominance relationships among solution candidates, <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> quality solutions <b>to</b> pTSPP and outperforms existing noise-aware dominance operators.

40|$|The {{advantages}} of nanocomposites containing single silicate layers uniformly dispersed in a polymer matrix were first demonstrated {{by researchers at}} Toyota in Japan, who developed nylon- 6 nanocomposites and published in 1993. Polymer-nanoclay nanocomposites have {{attracted the attention of}} many researchers thereafter due to their outstanding mechanical and barrier properties. This concept is first applied to synthesis of plastics/nanoclay nanocomposites and then expanded to preparation of rubber/nanoclay nanocomposites, since few years later. The various types of synthetic rubbers, such as silicon rubber, nitrile rubber and epoxy rubber, were used to prepare nanocomposites using different techniques, namely, melt intercalation, in situ intercalative polymerization, exfoliationadsorption and template synthesis, etc. Natural rubber (NR) was also used to prepare nanocomposites using the same techniques but with some modifications in the last decade. Now a day’s nanocomposites are widely developed in NR latex industry to achieve required properties with minimum use of clay content. NR/nanoclay nanocomposites exhibit markedly improved properties when compared to pure NR or their traditional composites. Most notable properties are increased tensile properties, gas barrier properties and heat distortion temperature, resistance to small molecule permeation, increase in atomic oxygen resistance and retention of impact strength. Tensile strength and modulus were recorded in current research as enhanced by more than two times or even ten times. It was noticed that obtaining a fully exfoliated structure is not at the desired level. Nanoclay nanocomposites are considered as fully exfoliated when inter gallery distance is greater than 10 nm but it was not achieved in many research work. Establishment of exfoliated structures in nanocomposites prepared in industrial scale is the major challenge that NR industry faces at present. NR/nanoclay nanocomposites produced with existing techniques develop high property fluctuations. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a technique to minimize property fluctuations and to obtain a reliable NR based product. It is predicted by this review that co-coagulation technique is the most promising and potential technique to fulfill the requirements of developing a NR/nanoclay nanocomposite. Use of modified nanoclays like Organoclays will <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> a reliable NR based product.

40|$|The {{simulation}} of composite manufacturing processes {{is a great}} <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtaining</b> efficient production and high quality parts. The mould and process design must allow for fast filling times as well as dry-spot free parts. In previous work we presented our software SimLCM for the {{simulation of}} force and velocity controlled Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) and Compression RTM. These are two examples of the general Liquid Composite Moulding (LCM) group of processes. Another recently popular subclass is Resin Infusion (RI), also know as Vacuum Assisted RTM. The simulation of RI adds an extra difficulty to the simulation process, as {{the height of the}} preform will change locally because of the filling. In contrast to CRTM, this change of height is not imposed, and thus not known beforehand. This paper describes the extension of SimLCM to the simulation of RI processes. The results of the simulations are compared with results from other programs that use different techniques, and also with experimentally obtained data found in literature. The comparison between simulation and experiment is found to be excellent. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{simulation}} of composite manufacturing processes {{is a great}} <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtaining</b> efficient production and high-quality parts. The mold and process design must allow for fast filling times as well as dry-spot free parts. Besides an accurate {{simulation of}} the resin flow through the reinforcement, the compaction response of the preform is also needed. The stress response of the textile to compaction {{has an influence on}} the local and global forces exerted on tooling. The numerical prediction of the clamping force helps to trade-off fast production times against affordable machinery. This article describes the accurate simulation of force controlled Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) and Compression RTM, and compares results of simulations with experimental data. A parametric study is performed in order to minimize the simulation time without compromising the accuracy of the results. The controlled force algorithms have been implemented within SimLCM, a code under development at the University of Auckland to address the liquid composite molding (LCM) family of manufacturing processes. With these new tools, the trade-off between production process time and equipment cost can be considered, and optimal process design solutions found. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} competitive factors in modern industry is customer satisfaction, particularly time-to-market and quality. To reduce lead times and total costs, companies produce or purchase parts and components in advance in order to assemble products quickly once a customer order has been received. As a practice, the design of modular products (the use of Super Bills) is the best <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtaining</b> an accurate process of demand forecasting, particularly with regard to ATO (Assembly To Order) or MTO (Make To Order) production systems. The best solution to forecast errors are safety stocks of pre-assembled modules or components. The literature presents several models for the calculus of the stock level for modular products, but input data are difficult to find so these models are consequently mostly qualitative. Moreover, some innovative models have previously been proposed by the authors to calculate the stock safety level for subassemblies or components in different operative contexts, with the results being presented at ICPR 17. These formulations require the definition of an important parameter k that relates to customer service level. This parameter strongly affects the logistic performance, so it can be optimized in order to minimize a total cost function. This paper aims to optimize parameter k analytically, which involves a trade off between component stock costs and production losses. It is possible to define the optimal customer service level for a generic part C belonging to n different modules. Finally, the paper contains two different industrial applications, one relating to production of air conditioning systems and the other to the wood industry...|$|R
