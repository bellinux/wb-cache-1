5|$|Jing ping {{bands are}} made up of a boumboum (boom pipe), syak or gwaj (scraper-rattle), tambal or tanbou (tambourine) and accordion. The double bass and banjo are also {{sometimes}} used. Bamboo flutes led the jing ping ensembles before the 1940s, when <b>accordions</b> were introduced. The Dominican flute tradition declined as a result, despite their additional use in serenades, until being revived after the National Independence Competitions.|$|E
5|$|Mikhail Tanich {{wrote the}} lyrics to every song the group {{performed}} until his death on April 17, 2008. In writing {{the lyrics to}} the songs Lesopoval performed, Mikhail Tanich drew on the six years he spent in a Soviet labor camp, during which time he came to empathize with criminals {{from all walks of}} life. In total, the group released at least 19 albums, including one after Mikhail Tanich's death. Until his death in 1994, Sergey Korzhukov wrote the musical melodies and performed most of the songs; after his death, other artists wrote and performed the melodies. Musically, most songs feature a guitar, drums, <b>accordions,</b> and are often performed with strong vocals.|$|E
5|$|Balabushka's {{first job}} {{was as a}} wooden toy {{designer}} and maker, working for the Educational Equipment Company, then located at 71 West 23rd St., in Manhattan, which made building blocks for nurseries and schools. Thereafter he built children's furniture for the Playtime Woodworking Company located on Greenwich Village's Jane Street. While on the job, Balabushka lost his middle finger to a band saw. Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic finger of such craftsmanship that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills deepened he began building <b>accordions</b> and other detailed carpentry pieces on his own time. In 1949, Balabushka applied for patent on a folding leg bracket mechanism he invented, which was granted in 1951.|$|E

5|$|The two-octave {{diatonic}} accordion (gorodo), popular across Madagascar, {{is believed}} to have been imported by French colonists after 1896. In the 20th century, the instrument was commonly performed during tromba spirit possession ceremonies in a style called renitra. In the 1970s, the renitra was incorporated for the performance of electrified salegy music. This accordion style was also integrated into the performance of tsapika, while also inspiring the style used by the guitarists in these bands. Although today the sound of the accordion is most often replicated by a synthesizer in salegy or tsapika bands due to the expense and rarity of the instrument, <b>accordions</b> continue to hold a privileged place in the performance of tromba ceremonial music. Artists like half-brothers Lego and Rossy have gained success as accordion players. Régis Gizavo brought the contemporary style of renitra to the world music scene, winning several international awards for his accordion performance.|$|E
5|$|Like many {{residents}} of the rural areas in central Madagascar at that time, Rakoto's brothers played the sodina, an end-blown tube traditionally made of bamboo or reed with three or six finger holes and a thumb hole down its length. One {{of the oldest and}} most iconic musical instruments in Madagascar, it is believed to have arrived on the island with the earliest settlers from Borneo around 2,000 years ago and remains widespread throughout the central highlands. Young Rakoto began playing the sodina when he was seven years old. He honed his skills by listening to village elders' sodina performances, and three years later the boy formed a small musical group called Ambohijatobe that performed locally at traditional festivities. During this period Rakoto had the opportunity to participate in a community musical competition. His competitors, who performed on <b>accordions</b> and guitars, threw stones at Rakoto when he stepped forward to perform on the sodina. Despite being struck in the face he completed his performance and was awarded first prize. In 1935 he was nominated by the local governor to represent his district in a national musical competition organized by the French colonial authority at Mahamasina stadium in Antananarivo. That same year Rakoto was orphaned at the age of 12, preventing him from further pursuing an education in the interest of earning a livelihood. A Frenchman hired the boy to work as an assistant baker until he came of age. Upon reaching adulthood, Rakoto left the bakery to become a metalworker while continuing to perform on the sodina in musical ensembles.|$|E

25|$|After Demian's invention, other <b>accordions</b> appeared, some {{featuring}} {{only the}} righthanded keyboard for playing melodies.

25|$|Jeune's flutina resembles Wheatstone's {{concertina}} {{in internal}} construction and tone color, {{but it appears}} to complement Demian's accordion functionally. The flutina is a one-sided bisonoric melody-only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left.
