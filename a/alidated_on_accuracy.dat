40|$|Abmm- We {{propose a}} new {{algorithm}} that simultaneously eslimates the intrinsic dimension and intrinsic entropy 01 random data sets lying on smooth manifolds. The method {{is based on}} asymptotic properties 01 entropic graph constructions. In particular, ne compute the Euclidean k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) graph oyer the sample points and use its overall total edge length to estimate intrinsic dimension and entropy. The algorithm is <b>alidated</b> <b>on</b> standard synthetic manifolds. 1...|$|R
40|$|Classifying {{segments}} and detecting {{changes in}} terrestrial areas {{are important and}} time-consuming efforts for remote sensing image analysis tasks, including comparison and retrieval in repositories containing multitemporal remote image samples for the same area in very different quality and details. We propose a multilayer fusion model for adaptive segmentation and change detection of optical remote sensing image series, where trajectory analysis or direct comparison is not applicable. Our method applies nsupervised or partly supervised clustering on a fused-image series by using cross-layer similarity measure, followed by multilayer Markov random field segmentation. The resulted label map is applied for the automatic training of single layers. After the segmentation of each single layer separately, changes are detected between single label maps. The significant benefit of the proposed method has been numerically <b>alidated</b> <b>on</b> remotely sensed image series with ground-truth data...|$|R

40|$|Two {{well-known}} response interference {{tasks are}} the Eriksen flanker task and the 					spatial conflict task. The tasks are logically equivalent, and comparable 					effects {{of current and}} previous stimulus type (congruent or incongruent) have 					been shown with regard to reaction time (RT). Here, we investigated whether 					interference and sequential trial effects also had comparable effects <b>on</b> 					<b>accuracy.</b> We specifically tested whether these effects interacted with the speed 					of responding using conditional accuracy functions (CAFs). The CAFs revealed 					that in both tasks congruency and sequential trial effects <b>on</b> <b>accuracy</b> are found 					only in trials with fast responses (< 600 ms). Sequential trial effects 					<b>on</b> <b>accuracy</b> were weaker for the flanker task than for the spatial conflict task. 					In very fast trials (< 400 ms) response activation by distracting 					flankers led to below-chance performance in the flanker task, but response 					activation by incongruent spatial location {{did not lead to}} below-chance 					performance in the spatial conflict task. The pattern of results hints at subtle 					differences in processing architecture between the tasks...|$|R
