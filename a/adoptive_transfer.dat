Methods: <b>Adoptive</b> <b>transfers</b> SIINFEKL specific CTL to RAG mice and then immunized them with SIINFEKL to generate ovalbumin specific memory CTL. C 57 BL/ 6 mice were <b>adoptive</b> <b>transferred</b> with memory CTL immunized with T-helper epitopes of ovalbumin and then challenged with ovalbumin specific tumor cells. Results: With SIINFEKL immunization, specific CTL proliferated and acquired memory CTL phenotypes; OVA specific T cells could help the host to generate more specific CTL but this effect is {{not strong enough to}} get tumor inhibition. Memory CTL needs T cells to completely regress the development of tumor formation. Conclusion: Long lasting antitumor effect needs both antigen specific memory CTL and specific T cells and so the design of tumor vaccine should include specific CTL and T peptides...|$|R

Research carried out at the Department of Tumour Cell Biology in Copenhagen has shown that CTL clones targeting specific melanoma tumor associated antigens (gp100 and MART-1) can successfully proliferate if melanoma cell lines are carefully preselected. At the same department, the SCID mouse model was demonstrated as “an excellent model system” for studying interaction between tumors and CTLs. Using this model, eradication of a human melanoma tumor by in vitro generating CTL clone was accomplished.

To investigate {{the pathogenesis of}} necrotizing arteritis in these rats (env-pX rats), <b>adoptive</b> <b>transfers</b> of spleen cells and bone marrow cells were done from env-pX rats before they developed arteritis to nontransgenic rats.
