40|$|Abstract:- Mass customization, {{globalization}} and short product development cycles, {{are pushing the}} manufacturing industry towards mergers and collaboration world wide. The strategy of product development is therefore transforming and concept of virtual and extended enterprise is emerging. Primarily important are enabling tools and technology for collaborating at global level. There is increasing need for tools to capture, represent, and exchange product development knowledge. Product development process, for complex product like aero plane, is featured with distributed workflows, and complicated collaborative lifecycle management issues. Product lifecycle management commonly known as PLM solutions is reshaping the processes, to address the need for integration through out the product lifecycle. This paper investigates into workflow as an enabler to collaborative design process for an <b>aeronautical</b> <b>product.</b> First we present {{an overview of the}} collaborative product development with a framework sketch.

40|$|Acoustic {{performances}} {{represent an}} important business aspect both referred to <b>aeronautical</b> <b>product</b> than transportation means in general. Very often, numerical modeling represent {{a powerful tool}} for the prediction of expected noise level once structural characteristics and noise source specification have been defined. These model may become very complex when strong interaction of structural and acoustic elements are involved as wells as the frequency range of interest increase. In any case, the availability of different, complementary approaches as those based on FEM, BEM, SEA, Ray Tracing, among the others, let assume that appreciable results can be achieved. In this scenario, it can be stated that one of the bigger limitation of these technique is the unavailability to investigate the subjective (more that objective) response to noise exposure that in many case in considered an important parameters when comfort or annoyance aspect need to be evaluated. That is the reason why deep interest is going to be dedicated to the “acoustic virtual prototyping” intended as the auralization process of a numerical simulation, that would guarantee the opportunity to “hear” the noise more than analyses its “technical descriptors”. It is important to underline that the not-stationary peculiarities of the phenomena, require that relative implementing tools have to be very fast in the signal computation as extremely precise in the signal reconstruction to guarantee the correspondence of “virtual “ noise to real expected one. The present work will present some results related to the implementation of a specifically designed digital FIR filters that, starting from results of “standard” numerical models (FEM/BEM or others), are able to reconstruct the time related system response and to digitalize the expected noise. First test have been performed on a geometrical simple box set-up, in relation to which both numerical model and experimental test campaign have been realized.

Transport historians are becoming increasingly attuned to the use of advertisements as a source of cultural reference. Though primarily designed to encourage the consumption of particular goods and services, advertisements also served to create, reinforce and intensify particular societal perceptions and cultural discourses surrounding the superiority (and thus desirability) of certain commodities, including different forms of transport and mobility. Through a content analysis of over 6, 800 advertisements that appeared in one British weekly aeronautical newspaper, Aeroplane, between 8 June 1911 and 25 June 1914, this paper documents the changing nature of the aeronautical goods and services that were advertised during this period.
