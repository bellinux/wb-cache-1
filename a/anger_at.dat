5|$|In the {{elections}} of 2001 and 2005, Labour maintained much of the middle-class support that it had won in 1997. In 2005, Labour's support was much lower {{than in the previous}} two elections, which David Rubinstein has attributed to <b>anger</b> <b>at</b> the war in Iraq and towards Blair himself.|$|E

5|$|Earp's <b>anger</b> <b>at</b> Holliday's ethnic slur may {{indicate}} that his feelings for Josephine were more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in the letter is compelling because {{at that time in}} the 1940s, the relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus in Tombstone was not public knowledge. Otero could know these things only if he had a relationship with someone who had personal knowledge of the individuals involved.|$|E
5|$|Gröning {{was born}} in 1921, in Lower Saxony, {{the son of a}} strict {{conservative}} and skilled textile worker. His mother died when he was four. His father, a proud nationalist, joined the Stahlhelm after Germany's defeat in the First World War, and his <b>anger</b> <b>at</b> how Germany had been treated following the Treaty of Versailles increased as his textile business went bankrupt in 1929 due to insufficient capital.|$|E
5|$|Kevin Wacholz, who had portrayed Nailz, {{left the}} WWF shortly after Survivor Series. Upset about his pay from SummerSlam 1992, he confronted WWF owner Vince McMahon and {{reportedly}} attacked him physically. He later testified against McMahon during {{a trial in}} which McMahon was accused of distributing steroids to wrestlers. Wacholz' statements have been reported as having a harmful effect on the prosecution's case because his <b>anger</b> <b>at</b> McMahon overshadowed his testimony.|$|E

25|$|Relations with Labour {{soon became}} very tense, with Liberal MPs {{increasingly}} <b>angered</b> <b>at</b> having {{to support a}} Labour Government which treated them which such open hostility. Many Liberals were also <b>angered</b> <b>at</b> MacDonald's pursuit of a trade agreement with the USSR, although Asquith rather less so. The intervention of a Labour candidate at a by-election in Oxford in June handed the seat to the Conservatives.|$|R

5|$|On 1 November 2009 about 250 {{protesters in}} Brisbane who {{expressed}} <b>anger</b> <b>at</b> Wotton's sentencing. The same week, similar rallies {{took place in}} major Australian cities and in Wellington, New Zealand. MUA workers in Sydney observed one minute's silence in solidarity. Speakers at a Brisbane rally argued that Wotton should {{have been given a}} bravery award for what they saw as standing up to the racist oppression of Palm Islanders. Benefit concerts were also held in support of him.|$|E
5|$|Roger's and his fellow-bishops' {{stories to}} Henry are {{often cited as}} the spark that touched off the king's <b>anger</b> <b>at</b> Becket and led to his martyrdom. However, it was more {{probably}} the stories of Becket's behaviour upon arrival in England that caused Henry's anger, and which indirectly led {{to the death of}} Becket. Roger was suspended by Pope Alexander III because he was implicated in Becket's death, but was restored to office on 16 December 1171.|$|E
5|$|Scots of the Riverina, a poem {{written by}} one of Australia's most renowned writers, Henry Lawson, is set in Gundagai. The poem {{describes}} a father's <b>anger</b> <b>at</b> his son's desertion at harvest time and later his grief when the son dies in battle in World War I. Hay and Hell and Booligal, written by Banjo Paterson, is a humorous take on life on the flat western Riverina plan.|$|E

5|$|<b>Anger</b> <b>at</b> Turnbull's {{response}} to the 23 November 2009 meeting triggered a spill motion against his leadership three days later. The motion was moved by Kevin Andrews, a former Minister in the Howard government, but was defeated {{by a vote of}} 48 to 35. Andrews was not seen as a genuine prospect for the leadership, so the close vote on the spill motion was considered a blow to Turnbull. While Abbott supported Turnbull at the time of Andrews' spill, he subsequently resigned from the frontbench. Several others joined Abbott in resigning, including Nick Minchin, Eric Abetz, Sophie Mirabella and Tony Smith.|$|E
5|$|George Hall and {{his family}} arrived in the New South Wales Colony in 1802. By 1825, the Halls had {{established}} two cattle stations in the Upper Hunter Valley, and had begun a northward expansion into the Liverpool Plains, New England and Queensland. Getting his cattle to the Sydney markets presented a problem in that thousands of head of cattle had to be moved for thousands of kilometres along unfenced stock routes through sometimes rugged bush and mountain ranges. A note, in his own writing, records Thomas Hall's <b>anger</b> <b>at</b> losing 200 head in scrub.|$|E
5|$|Johann Strauss I's {{influence}} over the local entertainment establishments meant {{that many of them}} were wary of offering the younger Strauss a contract for fear of angering the father. Strauss Jr. was able to persuade the Dommayer's Casino in Hietzing, a suburb of Vienna, to allow him to perform. The elder Strauss, in <b>anger</b> <b>at</b> his son's disobedience, and at that of the proprietor, refused to ever play at the Dommayer's Casino again, which had been the site of many of his earlier triumphs.|$|E
5000|$|Following World War II, the 6th was {{garrison}}ed in <b>Angers</b> <b>at</b> garrison Vernau, in {{designation of}} Jean-Edouard Verneau, a resistant French général, deceased in deportation in 1944.|$|R

5|$|On 22 May 1816, a {{group of}} 56{{residents}} met at The Globe Inn in Littleport to discuss the lack of work and rising grain costs. Fuelled by alcohol, the residents directed their <b>anger</b> <b>at</b> local farmer Henry Martin. He had been overseer of the poor in 1814 and was not well liked by the parishioners. One man went to get a horn from Burgess, the lighterman, and started blowing it outside The Globe Inn, gathering hundreds of villagers to join the first group, and the riot commenced.|$|E
5|$|Roger did {{not become}} deeply {{involved}} in the dispute between King Henry II of England and Becket until 1170, when the King had Roger preside at the coronation of the king's son Henry the Young King, a function that would normally have been performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. In retaliation Becket excommunicated Roger in late 1170, and some have seen this excommunication as one reason for King Henry's <b>anger</b> <b>at</b> Becket which led to Becket's martyrdom. After being suspended from office by the pope for his supposed role in Becket's death, Roger was eventually restored to office in late 1171, and died in 1181. The see of York remained vacant after his death until 1189.|$|E
5|$|The Presbyterian {{majority}} {{was quickly}} {{demonstrated by the}} election of their candidate the Duke of Hamilton as President of the Convention. On 12th March, James landed in Ireland and on 16th March, his Letter to the Convention was read out, demanding obedience and threatening punishment {{for those who did}} not comply. Public <b>anger</b> <b>at</b> the Letter's uncompromising tone meant some Episcopalians stopped attending the Convention, claiming to fear for their safety while others changed sides. Tensions were high, with Edinburgh Castle held by the Duke of Gordon, Dundee recruiting Highland levies for James and fears of an Irish invasion. These factors exaggerated the Presbyterian majority in the Convention which now met behind closed doors guarded by its own troops.|$|E

5|$|The {{cardinals}} then {{attempted to}} elect Vidoni again, but Chigi was now opposed to {{him out of}} <b>anger</b> <b>at</b> the French for excluding d'Elci. The Spanish cardinals also worked against Vidoni, implying {{at one point that}} Mariana of Austria, the Queen regent of Spain, had excluded Vidoni's candidacy. The Spanish then attempted to elect Benedetto Odescalchi, but d'Ailly declared that no one would be allowed to be elected unless they owed loyalty to Louis XIV. The Spanish soon sent word that their cardinals were free to vote for anyone. The letter was brought by courier and announced that Mariana of Austria had not actually excluded Vidoni nor any member of the college.|$|E
5|$|The gay {{community}} of San Francisco had a longstanding {{conflict with the}} San Francisco Police Department. White's status as a former police officer intensified the community's <b>anger</b> <b>at</b> the SFPD. Initial demonstrations took place as a peaceful march through the Castro district of San Francisco. After the crowd arrived at the San Francisco City Hall, violence began. The events caused {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars' worth of property damage to City Hall and the surrounding area, as well as injuries to police officers and rioters.|$|E
5|$|Yagan's skull {{was handed}} over to the Noongar {{delegation}} at a ceremony at Liverpool Town Hall on 31 August 1997. In accepting the skull, Colbung made comments that were interpreted as linking Yagan's death with the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, earlier that day: That is how nature goes... Nature is a carrier of all good things and all bad things. And because the Poms did the wrong thing, they now have to suffer. Colbung's comments prompted a media furore throughout Australia, with newspapers receiving many letters from the public expressing shock and <b>anger</b> <b>at</b> the comments. Colbung later claimed that his comments had been misinterpreted.|$|E
