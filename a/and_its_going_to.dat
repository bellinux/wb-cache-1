They worked with interior decorators to design more than 1,200 rooms and locations, and created over 300 characters with their own names, personalities and relationships, some modeled on Sega employees; detailed clay models of characters were produced as animation references. Algorithmically-generated weather and day-and-night cycles were implemented with reference to meteorological records of 1986 Yokosuka. Cut scenes were rendered in real time, without the use of FMV, and motion capture was used to capture the movements of real Budō (Japanese martial arts) experts. To fit the material onto a manageable number of discs, AM2 developed a new type of data compression.|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{the film}} {{originating}} as a Hellraiser project, {{it was still}} Tunnicliffes intention to differentiate Judgment from its predecessors, with his mantra being to [...] "innovate, not replicate". Tunnicliffe promised that Judgment [...] "will have moments unlike any other film you have ever seen", taking inspiration from the works of Hieronymus Bosch, Francis Bacon, David Cronenberg, David Lynch, David Fincher, and Hellraiser creator Clive Barker. Tunnicliffe later elaborated, [...] "I knew what I wanted to make, and I felt like you know what, I wrote a traditional Hellraiser story with Revelations and I got raped by the fans. Im {{not going to try}} and appease the fans anymore. Im going to make a film for me and I have a very strong idea visually on where I want to go with the story <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be very different. Im going to make a food for me and offer everybody a bite." [...] In regard to the poor reception of the most recent entries in the series, Tunnicliffe responded [...] "I think there has been a huge gap since Dimension are actually trying to do their best by the franchise. I think Weinstein Company is well aware that Hellworld was rushed into production and suffered for it, and Revelations suffered a similar set of problems (when the rights issue came up fast and furious without anyone knowing). Judgment is a rights issue movie, but has been made with the sensibilities and input given to a regular budgeted Dimension feature." [...] Acknowledging the negative reactions to Hellraiser: Revelations, Tunnicliffe stated that he was devastated that he was unable to direct the film, and that he was unhappy with the final cut and divergences made from the script. According to Tunnicliffe, [...] "To the fans, I would say this… I know you’ve been let down, and trust me, I have too, but simply give me a chance. I know we can never make a film as great as the first two Hellraisers, but I think we have a fun script here and an opportunity to give you all something that feels a little familiar, a little different, completely terrifying and is a worthy part of the Hellraiser Canon." ...|$|E

The motion associated with the highest score is finally adapted in order to accurately satisfy the kinematic constraints imposed by the virtual world. The experimental results show that it can efficiently control the avatar with an intuitive performance-based interface based on few motion sensors...|$|R
