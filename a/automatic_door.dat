5|$|Pericles {{runs into}} {{the wreck of the}} Oberon and Leo runs after him, {{followed}} by General Thade. Thade and Leo fight. Pericles tries to help Leo, but Thade throws him hard against a wall. Thade takes Leo's gun from him and tries to fire the weapon at Leo. Leo sees that Thade is within the pilot's deck and closes the <b>automatic</b> <b>door,</b> trapping Thade inside. Thade fires the weapon repeatedly at the door but the ricochets create sparks that cause Thade to huddle afraid under a control panel. Leo decides to escape the Planet of the Apes and return to Earth. He gives Pericles to Ari, who promises to look after him. He says goodbye and kisses Ari and Daena. Leo climbs aboard Pericles's undamaged pod and travels back in time through the same electromagnetic storm. Leo crashes in Washington, D.C. on Earth. He looks up at {{what appears to be the}} Lincoln Memorial, only to find that it is now a monument to General Thade. A swarm of police officers, firefighters, and news reporters descend on Leo, all of whom are apes.|$|E
25|$|The Greek scholar Heron of Alexandria {{created the}} {{earliest}} known <b>automatic</b> <b>door</b> in the 1st century AD during the era of Roman Egypt. The first foot-sensor-activated <b>automatic</b> <b>door</b> was made in China {{during the reign of}} Emperor Yang of Sui (r. 604–618), who had one installed for his royal library. The first automatic gate operators were later created in 1206 by Arab inventor Al-Jazari.|$|E

25|$|This is {{an older}} method of water-saving {{automatic}} flushing, which only operates when the room has been used. A push-button switch is {{mounted in the}} door frame of the restroom, and triggers the flush valve for all restroom urinals every time the door is opened. While it cannot detect the use of individual urinals, it provides reasonable flushing action without wasting excessive amounts of water when the restroom is not being used. This method requires a spring-operated <b>automatic</b> <b>door</b> closer, since the flush mechanism only operates when the restroom door opens.|$|E
25|$|Meteorologists use radar {{to monitor}} {{precipitation}} and wind. It {{has become the}} primary tool for short-term weather forecasting and watching for severe weather such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, winter storms, precipitation types, etc. Geologists use specialized ground-penetrating radars to map the composition of Earth's crust. Police forces use radar guns to monitor vehicle speeds on the roads. Smaller radar systems are used to detect human movement. Examples are breathing pattern detection for sleep monitoring and hand and finger gesture detection for computer interaction. <b>Automatic</b> <b>door</b> opening, light activation and intruder sensing are also common.|$|E
25|$|Passenger {{vehicles}} contained longitudinal {{seating for}} up to 16 passengers and standing room {{for up to}} 24 people (for a total of 40). The bodywork was made of acrylic-coated fiberglass and an <b>automatic</b> <b>door</b> was located on only one side. Across from the door a raised area provided room for hand luggage while hiding the manual controls. Emergency exits were located on {{each end of the}} vehicle. The passenger vehicles could be coupled to form 2- (or later) 3-car trains. The bi-directional motor could be switched and the car repositioned on the guideway to provide a right-opening or left-opening door.|$|E

[...] A few units have also been equipped with computers for the control system CIR-ELKE.|$|E
2500|$|A {{horn antenna}} or {{microwave}} horn is an antenna {{that consists of}} a flaring metal waveguide shaped like a horn to direct radio waves in a beam. [...] Horns are widely used as antennas at UHF and microwave frequencies, above 300MHz. [...] They are used as feed antennas (called feed horns) for larger antenna structures such as parabolic antennas, as standard calibration antennas to measure the gain of other antennas, and as directive antennas for such devices as radar guns, [...] <b>automatic</b> <b>door</b> openers, [...] and microwave radiometers. [...] Their advantages are moderate directivity, low standing wave ratio (SWR), broad bandwidth, and simple construction and adjustment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cars were}} ordered from General Electric and Avco. Aside from the boxier look and smaller side windows, the main changes {{between the new}} IVs and earlier Silverliners {{included}} a dynamic brake system, for which the resistance grids were fitted in the car's signature roof hump, and, for the Penn Central cars, a trainline <b>automatic</b> <b>door</b> system which removed the need for train crew to manually open doors at high level platforms. [...] The Silverliner IVs were also {{the first to be}} delivered in a married pair configuration, although a minority of cars were outfitted as single units. The delivery of the Silverliner IVs allowed SEPTA to replace most of its remaining PRR MP54s and Reading's pre-war MU fleet save for the 38 rebuilt [...] "Blueliner" [...] cars. [...] While being fitted with an updated propulsion system from General Electric, the Silverliner IVs were nevertheless still delivered with Ignitron tube rectifiers, which were later replaced with silicon controlled rectifiers.|$|E

2500|$|Former girlfriend Kym Wilson and her then-boyfriend, Andrew Reyment, {{were the}} last people to see Hutchence alive when they left him at 4:50am; he was still {{awaiting}} {{a phone call from}} Yates in London concerning whether she would bring their daughter Tiger to Australia. Hutchence's second last outgoing phone call was to his personal manager, Martha Troup's voice-mail, [...] "Marth, Michael here. I've fucking had enough." [...] When Troup returned the call there was no answer. At 9:54am he talked to his former longtime girlfriend, Michèle Bennett, who stated that he was crying, sounded upset and said he needed to see her. Bennett arrived at his door at about 10:40am, but there was no response. Hutchence's body was discovered by a hotel maid at 11:50am. Police reported that, [...] "He was in a kneeling position facing the door. He had used his snake skin belt to tie a knot on the <b>automatic</b> <b>door</b> closure {{at the top of the}} door, and had strained his head forward into the loop so hard that the buckle had broken." ...|$|E
2500|$|Offered {{in three}} levels of luxury: [...] "G", [...] "G Limited Edition", and [...] "G Dignis Edition", AWD is {{optional}} on the two base trims ("G Four" [...] and [...] "G Four Limited Edition").

The second level [...] "G Limited Edition" [...] gains 16-inch alloy wheels and cruise control, while the top-level [...] "G Dignis Edition" [...] features a metallic-finished grille insert, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), rain-sensing windscreen wipers, wood grain inserts for {{the steering wheel and}} shift knob, and a [...] widescreen touch LCD (incorporating satellite navigation, television, Bluetooth handsfree support, and G-BOOK telematics). Daihatsu continued with its Altis variant for the Japanese market, also introduced on 30 January 2006. Offered in [...] "G Limited Edition" [...] (FWD) and [...] "G Four Limited Edition" [...] (AWD) specification levels, the Altis roughly correlates with the Camry equivalents. Visually, the Altis is identical to the Japanese market Camry, with only the badging unique to the Daihatsu.|$|E
2500|$|The Silverliner IVs {{have never}} been officially rebuilt, {{but there have been}} a number of {{modifications}} to the class. [...] The propulsion system was initially upgraded from the original mercury arc–based Ignitron rectifiers to more reliable solid state silicon controlled rectifiers and later the main transformers had their coolant replaced with one that did not contain PCBs. [...] As this change was carried out in the early 1990s, all of the 9000 series Reading cars and some of the Penn Central cars were renumbered into the series 400 through 460 to help keep track of which units had undergone the modification. [...] When the Center City Commuter Connection opened in 1984, the Reading cars were converted to full train <b>automatic</b> <b>door</b> operation to take advantage of the high level platforms at the new Market East Station (now Jefferson Station) and others on the former PRR [...] "side" [...] of the system. [...] In the late 1990s the fleet received its most noticeable upgrade with the original [...] "ketchup and mustard" [...] colored interior replaced with a softer gray motif as well as softer seating. [...] Around 2004 SEPTA began to replace the cowcatcher pilots equipped on the original Reading cars with a bar type pilot to match those on the PRR cars. [...] Starting in 2009 SEPTA began to replace the original Faiveley pantographs with more modern Schunk type units.|$|E
