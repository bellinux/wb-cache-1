40|$|The Self-Interrogation Neutron Resonance Densitometry (SINRD) is {{a passive}} {{non-destructive}} assay (NDA) technique that is {{proposed for the}} direct measurement of 239 Pu in a spent fuel assembly. The insertion of neutron detectors wrapped with different neutron absorbing materials, or neutron filters, in the central guide tube of a PWR fuel assembly is envisaged to measure the neutron flux in the energy region close to the 0. 3 eV resonance of 239 Pu. In addition, the measurement of the fast neutron flux is foreseen. This paper {{is focused on the}} determination of the Gd and <b>Cd</b> neutron <b>filters</b> thickness to maximize the detection of neutrons within the resonance region. Moreover, several detector types are compared to identify the optimal condition and to assess the expected total neutron counts that can be obtained with the SINRD measurements. Results from Monte Carlo simulations showed that ranges between 0. 1 - 0. 3 mm and 0. 5 - 1. 0 mm ensure the optimal conditions for the Gd and <b>Cd</b> <b>filters,</b> respectively. Moreover, <b>a</b> 239 Pu fission chamber is better suited to measure neutrons close to the 0. 3 eV resonance and it has the highest sensitivity to 239 Pu, in comparison with a 235 U fission chamber, with a 3 He proportional counter, and with a 10 B proportional counter. The use of a thin Gd <b>filter</b> and <b>a</b> thick <b>Cd</b> <b>filter</b> is suggested for the 239 Pu and 235 U fission chambers to increase the total counts achieved in a measurement, while a thick Gd <b>filter</b> and <b>a</b> thin <b>Cd</b> <b>filter</b> are envisaged for the 3 He and 10 B proportional counters to increase the sensitivity to 239 Pu. We concluded that an optimization process that takes into account measurement time, filters thickness, and detector size is needed to develop a SINRD detector that can meet the requirement for an efficient verification of spent fuel assemblies.

Based on the first experimental tasks that examined filter pore size and trapping efficiency, stainless steel filter media with a 20 {micro}m pore size was selected. A series of experiments using these filters was conducted during this second task {{to determine the effect}} of filter temperature on zinc vapor trapping efficiency, adhesion and morphology. The tests were conducted with the filters heated to 60, 120, and 200 C; the zinc source material was heated to 400 C for all the experiments to provide a consistent zinc source. The samples were evaluated for mass change, deposit adhesion and morphology. As expected from the physical vapor deposition literature, a difference in deposit morphology and appearance was observed between the three filter temperatures. The filter held at 60 C had the largest average mass gain while the 120 and 200 <b>C</b> <b>filters</b> exhibited similar but lower weight gains.

In Paper I we also detected a double MS {{that has not been}} detected in previous observations of NGC 1851. We now match this photometry to NGC 1851 's published RGB abundances and find the two RGB branches observed in C generally exhibit different abundance characteristics in a variety of elements (e. g., Ba, Na, and O) and in CN band strengths, but no single element can define the two RGB branches. However, simultaneously considering [Ba/Fe] or CN strengths with either [Na/Fe], [O/Fe], or CN strengths can separate the two photometric RGB branches into two distinct abundance groups. Matches of NGC 1851 's published SGB and HB abundances to the Washington photometry shows consistent characterizations of the MPs, which can be defined as an O-rich/N-normal population and an O-poor/N-rich population. Photometric synthesis for both the Washington <b>C</b> <b>filter</b> and the F 336 W filter finds that these abundance characteristics, with appropriate variations in He, can reproduce for both filters the photometric observations in both the RGB and the MS.

In the literature, most of the studies on the characterization of organic matter in atmospheric {{particulate matter}} have been conducted on the water soluble fraction using 1 H NMR [5]. Note that even 2 D 1 H- 13 C HSQC and HMQC can only detect protonated carbons. Thus, these studies completely lose the nonprotonated structural information. In addition, the characterization of insoluble fractions is also examined. To some extent, solid-state NMR is essential for providing relatively complete structural information on organic matter in atmospheric organic matter. To the best of our knowledge, there are only a number of cases using solid-state NMR to study its organic matter. In almost all these studies, simple 13 C cross polarization/magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) and spectral editing techniques have been used. The high-spinning speed multi-ramped amplitude cross polarization/magic angle spinning (multiCP/MAS) technique was applied for acquiring quantitative 13 C NMR spectra [20].

MilkMine is an attempt to provide a single informatics resource to help milk protein scientists mine this information mountain more effectively, by integrating standard experimental data types with data generated by emerging text-mining techniques. A method was initially developed to identify milk-related terminology from peer-reviewed biological literature and this was used to complement the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), a large thesaurus of biological concepts, their variant names and their types. The resultant enriched ontology was then mapped to the free text of peer-reviewed biological literature using the MMTx program producing a database of semantically enriched sentences. A co-occurrence relation extraction algorithm was written to identify relationships between milk proteins and peptides, and other biological concepts, such as diseases or biological processes. Using these literature relation sets new hypotheses can be generated using the basic principle that if “A is linked to B”, and if “B is linked to C” then we can infer an association between <b>A</b> and <b>C.</b> <b>Filtering</b> and downstream processing of the many generated relationships promotes significant interactions. These literature relations and hypotheses are integrated with biological data into the MilkMine database. The MilkMine database is built upon on a generic data warehousing system, InterMine. This tool enabled the integration of traditional data types, such as protein sequence or structural data, {{from a variety of sources}} (e. g. UniProt). However, the standard InterMine model was also extended by the author to include other data sources (e. g. the Protein Data Bank) and to incorporate the output of the text-mining algorithm. This integration of otherwise disparate information allows more complex querying of the data, across many data types. For example, protein sequences are mapped to instances of the names, synonyms or symbols of the protein in text, therefore a raw fragment of amino acid sequence (e. g. a particular binding region) can be used to search the MilkMine database for literature information as well as the interactions and hypotheses of those proteins that contain the sequence. The MilkMine resource is accessible online (www. bioinformatics. ed. ac. uk/milkmine) through a professional level query interface offering many features such as an interactive query builder, standard ready-to-run queries, bulk downloads and the ability to store user preferences and query histories.

We implement Swift in the Linux 2. 6 kernel for both i 386 and x 86 64 architectures. The Swift userspace library supports two sets of application programming interfaces (APIs) : a BPF-friendly API for backward compatibility and an object oriented API for simplifying filter coding. We extensively evaluate the dynamic and static filtering performance of Swift on multiple machines with different hardware setups. We compare Swift with BPF (the BSD packet filter) —the de facto standard for packet filtering in modern operating systems—and hand-coded optimized <b>C</b> <b>filters</b> that are used for demonstrating possible performance gains. For dynamic filtering tasks, Swift is at least three orders of magnitude faster than BPF in terms of filter update latency. For static filtering tasks, Swift outperforms BPF up to three times in terms of packet processing speed, and achieves much closer performance to the optimized <b>C</b> <b>filters.</b> ...|$|R

In particular, we provide examples for a single-ended CMOS amplifier pair, a Schmitt Trigger circuit and a operational transconductance amplifier <b>C</b> <b>filter,</b> circuit blocks essential for low-noise high-performance integrated circuits for analog and mixed-signal applications. The topologies and biasing schemes explored here show how the nanoscale DG-MOSFETs {{may be used for}} efficient, tolerant and smaller circuits with tunable characteristics.
