5|$|Based on spectroscopy, Saturn {{is thought}} to be similar in {{composition}} to Jupiter, but the other giant planets Uranus and Neptune have relatively less hydrogen and helium <b>and</b> <b>relatively</b> more ices and are thus now termed ice giants.|$|E

5|$|The tail is rounded <b>and</b> <b>relatively</b> {{short for}} a vulture; {{the tip of}} the closed wing extends beyond the tail. Immature lesser yellow-headed {{vultures}} have browner plumage, a dusky head, and a white nape.|$|E
5|$|Trees such as palms {{protect their}} fruit by {{multiple}} layers of armor, needing efficient tools to break through to the seed contents, and special skills to climb the tall <b>and</b> <b>relatively</b> smooth trunk.|$|E

5|$|A {{dust devil}} is a strong, well-formed, <b>and</b> <b>relatively</b> {{long-lived}} whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre wide {{and a few}} metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to {{pose a threat to}} both people and property.|$|E
5|$|Another {{month of}} {{discussion}} <b>and</b> <b>relatively</b> minor refinement followed, during which several {{attempts were made}} to alter the Rutledge draft, though few were successful. Some wanted to add property qualifications for people to hold office, while others wanted to prevent the national government from issuing paper money. Madison in particular wanted to push the Constitution back in the direction of his Virginia plan.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other {{composite}} materials (such as reinforced concrete), the two materials act together, each overcoming the deficits of the other. Whereas the plastic resins are strong in compressive loading <b>and</b> <b>relatively</b> weak in tensile strength, the glass fibers are very strong in tension but tend not to resist compression. By combining the two materials, GRP becomes a material that resists both compressive and tensile forces well. The two materials may be used uniformly or the glass may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience tensile loads.|$|E

5|$|At one time, one {{hurricane}} researcher {{identified a}} tropical storm over Cuba in late August, {{although there was no}} evidence the storm actually existed. There was also a report of a hurricane over Louisiana on October22, although it is unknown if it was related to other storms in the season. There may have been additional unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, <b>and</b> <b>relatively</b> unpopulated coastlines.|$|E
5|$|Azotobacter {{species are}} {{ubiquitous}} in neutral and weakly basic soils, but not acidic soils. They {{are also found}} in the Arctic and Antarctic soils, despite the cold climate, short growing season, <b>and</b> <b>relatively</b> low pH values of these soils. In dry soils, Azotobacter can survive in the form of cysts for up to 24 years.|$|E
5|$|Bryars {{chose to}} {{distinguish}} the character types through the vocal ranges they were given. The adults of the town are largely given deep voices, bass and bass-baritone for the men, contralto and mezzo-soprano for the women. The lovers have high voices, soprano and counter-tenor. In {{order to make the}} scientists sound unlike the townspeople, Bryars made Ox a tenor and Ygène a baritone, both parts being agile, lyric <b>and</b> <b>relatively</b> high in their voice range.|$|E
40|$|The thermal desulfination of allylsulfinic acid {{proceeds}} with {{a negative}} activation volume, solvent independence <b>and</b> a <b>relatively</b> small deuterium isotope effect which, together {{with the results of}} a previous stereochemical study, confirm a concerted retro-ene mechanism <b>and</b> suggest a <b>relatively</b> compact, early transition state...|$|R

5|$|Eyespots are {{a type of}} automimicry used by some lepidopterans. In butterflies, {{the spots}} are {{composed}} of concentric rings of scales of different colours. The proposed role of the eyespots is to deflect predators' attention. Their resemblance to eyes provokes the predator's instinct to attack these wing patterns. The role of filamentous tails in Lycaenidae has been suggested as confusing predators as to the real location of the head, giving them {{a better chance of}} escaping alive <b>and</b> <b>relatively</b> unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Given {{sufficiently}} high baryon densities <b>and</b> <b>relatively</b> {{low temperatures}} – possibly {{comparable to those}} found in neutron stars – quark matter is expected to degenerate into a Fermi liquid of weakly interacting quarks. This liquid would be characterized by a condensation of colored quark Cooper pairs, thereby breaking the local SU(3)c symmetry. Because quark Cooper pairs harbor color charge, such a phase of quark matter would be color superconductive; that is, color charge would be able to pass through it with no resistance.|$|E
5|$|Goldman grouped four {{subspecies}} of couesi {{from the}} interior plateaus of central Mexico together—albiventer, crinitus, aztecus, and regillus. Three of those (albiventer from Jalisco, crinitus from the Distrito Federal, and aztecus from Morelos) were described by Merriam in 1901, and Goldman had himself described regillus from Michoacán in 1915. According to Goldman, aztecus is pale and large-toothed, crinitus is large, dark and large-toothed, regillus is large and dark, and albiventer is large <b>and</b> <b>relatively</b> pale.|$|E
