These were not attached to any other bone, but fit into a pair of deep cavities on the palate and were free to move. The lower jaw was connected with the upper jaw in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> the tusk whorl thrust out as a dagger when the head was raised. The upper jaw, containing 30 teeth which decrease in size posteriorly, is well preserved in many individuals. Juveniles have six tusks, while adults have three.|$|E
25|$|Attempted {{reform of}} labor {{relations}} in the mid-1970s also included severe restrictions on rights to discharge workers once they passed a brief trial period of employment. A review process set up to examine disputes was implemented in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> discharges practically impossible. Businesspeople circumvented the restrictions to some degree by hiring workers on a temporary basis {{up to the point}} at which they would have to be kept and then letting them go before the restrictions applied. Businesspeople remained unremittingly hostile to this type of regulation, primarily {{on the grounds that it}} took away their main means of exercising discipline over their workers. This form of regulation was also eliminated shortly after Velasco lost power.|$|E
25|$|The {{territory}} of eastern Galicia {{had once been}} {{an integral part of}} the medieval state of Kievan Rus before existing as an independent kingdom and principality until 1349. From the mid 14th century until 1772 it had been ruled by Poland. Following the First Partition of Poland in 1772 it became a part of the Austrian Empire (see Austrian partition). The Austrian government emancipated the Ukrainian peasants from serfdom, introduced a rudimantary educational system, and raised the status of Ukrainian Catholic priests in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> them equal to Roman Catholic priests. These reforms insured the loyalty of most of the Ukrainian population to the Austrian state. When the Austrian Empire was reorganized as Austria–Hungary eastern Galicia continued to be under Austria's jurisdiction and remained this way until the Empire's collapse following World War I.|$|E

25|$|Insects {{that had}} evolved their proto-wings {{in a world}} without flying predators could afford to be exposed openly without risk, but this changed when {{carnivorous}} flying insects evolved. It is unknown when they first evolved, but once these predators had emerged they put a strong selection pressure on their victims and themselves. Those of the prey {{who came up with}} a good solution about how to fold their wings over their backs in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> it possible for them to live in narrow spaces would not only be able to hide from flying predators (and terrestrial predators if they were on the ground) but also to exploit a wide variety of niches that were closed to those who couldn't fold their wings in this way. And today the neopterous insects (those that can fold their wings back over the abdomen) are by far the most dominant group of insects.|$|E
25|$|According to {{classical}} rabbinical literature, {{in order for}} the Urim and Thummim to give an answer, it was first necessary for the individual to stand facing the fully dressed high priest, and vocalise the question briefly and in a simple way, though it was not necessary for it to be loud enough for anyone else to hear it. The Talmudic rabbis argued that Urim and Thummim were words written on the sacred breastplate. Most of the Talmudic rabbis, and Josephus, following the belief that Urim meant lights, argued that divination by Urim and Thummim involved questions being answered by great rays of light shining out of certain jewels on the breastplate; each jewel was taken to represent different letters, and the sequence of lighting thus would spell out an answer (though there were 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet, and only 12 jewels on the breastplate); two Talmudic rabbis, however, argued that the jewels themselves moved in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> them stand out from the rest, or even moved themselves into groups to form words.|$|E
25|$|Stravinsky {{formed a}} {{business}} and musical relationship with the French piano manufacturing company Pleyel. Pleyel essentially acted as his agent in collecting mechanical royalties for his works and provided him with a monthly income and a studio space at its headquarters in which he could work and entertain friends and business acquaintances. Under the terms of his contract with the company, Stravinsky agreed to arrange (and to some extent re-compose) many of his early works for the Pleyela, Pleyel's brand of player piano. He did so in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> full use {{of all of the}} piano's eighty-eight notes, without regard for human fingers or hands. The rolls were not recorded, but were instead marked up from a combination of manuscript fragments and handwritten notes by Jacques Larmanjat, musical director of Pleyel's roll department. Among the compositions that were issued on the Pleyela piano rolls are the Rite of Spring, Petrushka, the Firebird and Song of the Nightingale. During the 1920s, Stravinsky recorded Duo-Art rolls for the Aeolian Company in both London and New York, not all of which have survived.|$|E

500|$|Campin, van Eyck and van der Weyden {{established}} naturalism as {{the dominant}} style in 15th-century northern European painting. These artists sought {{to show the world}} as it actually was, and to depict people in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> them look more human, with a greater complexity of emotions than had been previously seen. This first generation of Early Netherlandish artists were interested in the accurate reproduction of objects (according to Panofsky they painted [...] "gold that looked like gold"), paying close attention to natural phenomena such as light, shadow and reflection. They moved beyond the flat perspective and outlined figuration of earlier painting in favour of three-dimensional pictorial spaces. The position of viewers and how they might relate to the scene became important for the first time; in the Arnolfini Portrait, Van Eyck arranges the scene as if the viewer has just entered the room containing the two figures. Advancements in technique allowed far richer, more luminous and closely detailed representations of people, landscapes, interiors and objects.|$|E

Ahsan Haque of IGN said that [...] "Family Guy {{has never really}} done anything particularly special for the last episode of any season [...] and despite the obvious efforts to increase the animation quality and try to tell a complete story in this episode, it didn't {{turn out to be}} the winning effort that will keep fans eagerly awaiting the show's return next season". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a D, and called it an [...] "unfortunate and unfunny flashback [...] with lots of incest gags [...] was genuinely queasy-making, but not in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> anyone laugh from the shock of recognition or anything like that", but said that Family Guy can be [...] "damn funny when it wants to be", referring to the Fox promos that take up the bottom quarter of the screen. Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave the episode a positive review, stating: [...] "Good fun story, good fun jokes", but said that the end [...] "felt flat" [...] because of the Revenge of the Nerds music sequence.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times Jon Pareles wrote, [...] "She's {{the woman}} with everything: the voice, the moves, the songs, the ideas and the clothes. Her two-hour set was a {{brilliant}} pop extravaganza that kept the songs at its center." [...] He further noted that Knowles didn't need distractions from her singing, [...] "which can be airy or brassy, tearful or vicious, rapid-fire with [...] staccato syllables or sustained in curlicued melismas. But she was in constant motion". Lee Hildebrand of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a very positive review for the concert and noted that Knowles performed [...] "two fast-paced hours of terrific singing, solid musicianship, spectacular staging {{and some of the}} most imaginative choreography ever to have graced the stage of Oracle Arena." [...] Hildebrand further noted that Knowles used [...] "occasional bits of rasp to her ringing mezzo tones to emphasize key lines" [...] while performing the ballads. He wrote that every [...] "twitch, turn, slide and hip shake was in perfect sync" [...] and praised the singer's constant motion most of the time which never left her [...] "out of breath". While reviewing Knowles' concert in Bangkok, Thailand, Lisnaree Vichitsorasatra of The Nation praised her dancing which included [...] "shaking, bouncing and belly dancing, mixed with hip-hop" [...] further comparing it with Shakira's. She further noted that the highlight of the show was when Knowles sang the slow-tempo ballads. The Courier Mails Tonya Turner praised Knowles' [...] "passionate and fiery" [...] performance accompanied by [...] "frantic booty popping and sexy R moves". Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Ann Powers noted that the tour was one of the [...] "modern superstar spectacles that casts the artist's reality onto the level of myth". However, she noted, that [...] "Beyoncé's 'Experience' plays off the performer's well-known struggles and triumphs to build a story that will make fans both gawk and relate. The maddening thing about this dazzling entertainment, though, is that the tale it tells is partly the wrong one." [...] She concluded the review by saying, [...] "Beyoncé is electric in concert yet reined in by her show's post-feminist theme. Why not just let it be about her musical prowess?". Jim Farber of the New York Daily News praised Knowles' energy and powerful performance on stage, writing [...] "With her triumphant gait, statuesque figure and steely stare, the singer seemed primed not just to perform but to vanquish... Beyoncé sang with a fiery determination, stressing cries and shouts that had no use for subtlety and even less for vulnerability. She danced at an equally mad clip... hitting every mark with a vengeance... A Beyoncé show... {{has everything to do with}} power and nothing to do with nuance. It's the kind of thing meant to inspire awe, not intimacy... She sang her songs last night with the force of a rapper, stressing pieces from her two solo albums in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> every sound seem percussive." [...] However, Farber criticized the unsure repertoire of songs performed, writing [...] "Many of her tunes prove too skittish to sink in, and some of her rhythms are too robotic to find a groove." [...] Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter noted that the snippets of other artists that Knowles included in her own songs were refreshing and included the fast-paced Destiny's Child medley and the performances of [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] and [...] "Listen" [...] as highlights of the show. He further noted, ...|$|E

2500|$|Implicit or {{explicit}} {{in most of}} the early studies is that the area of the gap junction was different in structure to the surrounding membranes in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> it look different.

This portion of extra-cellular space was somewhat isolated from the surrounding space and also bridged by what we now call connexon pairs which form even more tightly sealed bridges that cross the gap junction gap between two cells.
