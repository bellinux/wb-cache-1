25|$|The Renaissance and {{exploration}} both had significant {{impacts on the}} development of jewellery in Europe. By the 17th century, increasing exploration and trade led to increased availability {{of a wide variety of}} gemstones as well as exposure to the art of other cultures. Whereas prior to this the working of gold and precious metal had been at the forefront of jewellery, this period saw increasing dominance of gemstones and their settings. An example of this is the Cheapside Hoard, the stock of a jeweller hidden in London during the Commonwealth period and not found again until 1912. It contained Colombian emerald, topaz, <b>amazonite</b> from Brazil, spinel, iolite, and chrysoberyl from Sri Lanka, ruby from India, Afghan lapis lazuli, Persian turquoise, Red Sea peridot, as well as Bohemian and Hungarian opal, garnet, and amethyst. Large stones were frequently set in box-bezels on enamelled rings. Notable among merchants of the period was Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, who brought the precursor stone of the Hope Diamond to France in the 1660s.|$|E
50|$|The major {{collecting}} {{areas are}} {{on the west side}} of the mountain and they contain the usual assortment of smoky quartz and <b>amazonite,</b> although, like the Tarryalls, the <b>amazonite</b> is usually very pale and is most often grades into plain microcline.|$|E
50|$|For many years, {{the source}} of <b>amazonite's</b> color was a mystery. Naturally, many people assumed the color was due to copper because copper {{compounds}} often have blue and green colors. More recent {{studies suggest that the}} blue-green color results from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar.|$|R
5|$|Many {{minerals}} provide pigments {{which have}} been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries. Pigments, in this case, are minerals which reflect the color green, rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities. The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the emerald, which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3), is called chrome green, also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment. For many years, the source of <b>amazonite's</b> color was a mystery. Widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors, the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar. Copper {{is the source of the}} green color in malachite pigments, chemically known as basic copper(II) carbonate.|$|R
2500|$|After {{three years}} in Safavid Iran since {{returning}} from her last trip with her husband, Teresia left her country of birth forever. She lived in Constantinople for three years, receiving [...] a certificate from the commissary general of the Dominicans in the East on 21 June 1634 attesting to her pious conduct. Around that time, she decided to retire to a convent in Rome which {{was attached to the}} Carmelite Santa Maria della Scala church. On 27 December 1634 she arrived in Rome and was received kindly by Pope Urban VIII, who entrusted her to the Carmelites. Teresia bought a house next to the church; in 1658 she had Robert's remains transported from Isfahan to Rome, where he was reburied in the convent. In the Carmelite convent, she devoted herself to charity and religion until her death at age 79 in 1688. Teresia was buried at the convent, where she had lived for forty years. She had her headstone inscribed, [...] "Teresia Sampsonia <b>Amazonites</b> Samphuffi Circassiae Principes Filia" [...] (translated by David W. Davies as [...] "Teresia Sampsonia, native of the region of the Amazons, daughter of Samphuffus, prince of Circassia").|$|R
50|$|Pikes Peak is itself, an {{intrusive}} {{center and}} smoky quartz and <b>amazonite</b> {{can be found}} in many areas within four miles (6 km) of the summit. For example, <b>amazonite</b> can be found next to Barr Trail, the main hiking route to the summit of Pikes Peak. The most famous collecting area on the Peak is Glenn Cove, a glacial cirque located at 11000 ft {{on the north side of}} the mountain.

50|$|The Tarryall Mountains {{are located}} about 12 mi north of Lake George. They {{represent}} an intrusive center called the Redskin Stock. Like the other localities in the region, smoky quartz and <b>amazonite</b> {{are the primary}} minerals, however, the <b>amazonite</b> is usually very pale and grading into ordinary pink or white microcline feldspar.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amazonite</b> is {{a mineral}} of limited occurrence. Formerly it was {{obtained}} almost exclusively {{from the area}} of Miass in the Ilmensky Mountains, 50 miles southwest of Chelyabinsk, Russia, where it occurs in granitic rocks. More recently, high-quality crystals have been obtained from Pike's Peak, Colorado, where it is found associated with smoky quartz, orthoclase, and albite in a coarse granite or pegmatite. Crystals of <b>amazonite</b> {{can also be found}} in Crystal Park, El Paso County, Colorado. Other locations in the United States which yield <b>amazonite</b> include the Morefield Mine in Amelia, Virginia. It is also found in pegmatite in Madagascar and in Brazil.|$|E
