50|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>geography</b> is a {{subfield}} of the nature-society/human-environment {{branch of}} geography {{as well as}} a part of the larger, interdisciplinary umbrella of Human-Animal Studies (HAS). <b>Animal</b> <b>geography</b> is defined as the study of “the complex entangling's of human-animal relations with space, place, location, environment and landscape” or “the study of where, when, why and how nonhuman animals intersect with human societies.” Recent work advances these perspectives to argue about an ecology of relations in which humans and animals are enmeshed, taking seriously the lived spaces of animals themselves and their sentient interactions with not just human but other nonhuman bodies as well. The <b>Animal</b> <b>Geography</b> Specialty Group of the Association of American Geographers was founded in 2009 by Monica Ogra and Julie Urbanik. The <b>Animal</b> <b>Geography</b> Research Network was founded in 2011 by Daniel Allen.|$|E

5000|$|The {{middle of}} the 20th century saw a turn away from {{zoogeography}} (while never fully relinquishing it) towards questions about and interest in the impact of humans on wildlife and in human relations with livestock. Two key geographers shaping this wave of <b>animal</b> <b>geography</b> were Carl Sauer and Charles Bennett. Sauer’s interest in the cultural landscape - or cultural ecology (how human cultures are shaped and are shaped by their environment) - necessarily involved addressing the topic of animal domestication. In Sauer’s research he focused {{on the history of}} domestication, and how human uses of livestock shaped the landscape (via fencing, grazing, and shelters). [...] Bennett called for a ‘cultural animal geography’ that focused on the interactions of animals and human cultures such as subsistence hunting and fishing. [...] The shift from the first wave to the second wave of <b>animal</b> <b>geography</b> {{had to do with the}} species being studied. Second wave <b>animal</b> <b>geography</b> brought domesticated livestock into the view instead of just focusing on wildlife. For the next several decades <b>animal</b> <b>geography,</b> as cultural ecology, was dominated by research into the origins of domestication, cultural rituals around domestication, and different cultures livestock relations (sedentary versus nomadic herding). Key works include Simoons and Simoons’ A Ceremonial Ox of India, Gades’ work on the guinea pig, and Cansdale’s Animals and Man. [...] Baldwin provides an excellent overview of second wave <b>animal</b> <b>geography</b> research.|$|E

5000|$|Elephants have {{featured}} {{most prominently}} in <b>animal</b> <b>geography,</b> {{beginning with the}} work of Whatmore & Thorne on the spatial configurations of wildlife. They ask questions about how the African elephant Duchess is configured by different practices in zoos, contrasting her with counterparts in the wild. Whatmore & Thorne's exploration of becoming-elephant was a milestone in animal and more-than-human geographies. [...] Asian elephants have also been the feature of historical animal geographies, the subjects of <b>animal</b> <b>geography</b> methods, interdisciplinary biogeographies,. [...] They have been the mainstay of new work on cosmopolitan ecologies, and in thinking about the links between political ecology and nonrepresentational theory.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first wave}} of <b>animal</b> <b>geography,</b> known as zoogeography, came to {{prominence}} as a geographic subfield from the late 1800s through {{the early part of}} the 20th century. During this time the study of animals was seen as a key part of the discipline and the goal was “the scientific study of animal life with reference to the distribution of animals on the earth and the mutual influence of environment and animals upon each other.” [...] The animals that were the focus of studies were almost exclusively wild animals and zoogeographers were building on the new theories of evolution and natural selection. They mapped the evolution and movement of species across time and space and also sought to understand how animals adapted to different ecosystems."The ambition was to establish general laws of how animals arranged themselves across the earth's surface or, at smaller scales, to establish patterns of spacial co-variation between animals and other environmental factors" [...] Key works include Newbigin’s <b>Animal</b> <b>Geography,</b> Bartholomew, Clarke, and Grimshaw’s Atlas of Zoogeography, and Allee and Schmidt’s Ecological <b>Animal</b> <b>Geography.</b>|$|E

This paper extends {{recent work}} that has called for greater attention {{to be paid to}} nonhuman difference. The burgeoning <b>animal</b> <b>geographies</b> literature has been very successful in dissecting the concept of 'nature' and in examining the myriad ways in which animal and human lives are intertwined. However, its focus is more often on collectivities, such as species and herds, than on individual animals.

It argues that future work might usefully pay greater attention to the lived experience of individual animals, and that further emphasis should be given to non-mammalian life forms. Doing so might not only shed light on these creatures' encounters with humans, but also help to give a greater sense of their lives beyond these direct encounters, challenging understandings {{of what it means to}} be 'animal'.

From theoretical explorations of wildlife classification to case studies of human-wildlife conflict, wildlife tourism, to particular human-wild <b>animal</b> <b>geographies,</b> this has proven a dynamic avenue. Key articles include Emel’s work on wolves, work on wildlife and mobility, Vaccaro and Beltran’s work on reintroductions, Whatmore and Thorne’s work on relational typologies of wildlife, and further extensions of the latter's work through explorations of animals and conservation in trans-national contexts.|$|R
50|$|The two key {{features}} of the third wave of <b>animal</b> <b>geography</b> that distinguish it from the earlier waves are (1) an expanded notion of human-animal relations to include all locations of human-animal encounters (rather than just wildlife or livestock, and (2) attempts {{to bring in the}} animals themselves as subjects. Since the 1995 publication there has been an explosion of case studies and theorizing. Three key works that bring together third wave <b>animal</b> <b>geography</b> are Wolch and Emel’s Animal Geographies: Place, Politics and Identity in the Nature-Culture Borderlands, Philo and Wilbert’s Animal Spaces, Beastly Places: New Geographies of Human-Animal Relations, and Urbanik’s Placing Animals: An Introduction to the Geography of Human-Animal Relations.|$|E

50|$|Geography is a {{systematic}} {{study of the}} Earth and its features. Traditionally, geography {{has been associated with}} cartography and place names. Although many geographers are trained in toponymy and cartology, this is not their main preoccupation. Geographers study the space and the temporal database distribution of phenomena, processes, and features as well as the interaction of humans and their environment. Because space and place affect a variety of topics, such as economics, health, climate, plants and <b>animals,</b> <b>geography</b> is highly interdisciplinary. The interdisciplinary nature of the geographical approach depends on an attentiveness to the relationship between physical and human phenomena and its spatial patterns.|$|R

In our paper we do not propose to gauge {{the success or failure}} of this effort; rather we are interested in fleshing out some conceptual approaches via Actor- Network Theory through which infrastructure projects can start to address a series of overlooked questions. Some of these questions are firmly located within the realm of construction project management: are animals considered project risks or stakeholders; is wildlife always simply a retrospective cost to a project or can it proactively benefit a project, can we ever manage wildlife, and if so how? These questions in turn lead us to engage with wider debates found in the margins between the social and biological sciences on the distinction between Nature and Politics: to what extent should we seek a place for animals in politics and how can we live with them ethically. Thus far, very little research has addressed the interplay of humans and animals within construction projects. Instead those interested in the politics and ethics of human-animal relations, or Animal Studies, have focussed far more on stable and contained sites, whether organisations like zoos, farms or laboratories, or other places like homes and parks.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s several things {{happened}} to cause geographers {{with an interest}} in animals and human-animal relations to rethink what was possible within <b>animal</b> <b>geography.</b> The 1980s and early 1990s saw the rise of the world-wide animal advocacy movement addressing everything from pet overpopulation to saving endangered species, exposing cruelty to animals in industrial farming (factory farms or concentrated animal feeding operations), and protesting circuses, the use of fur, and hunting - all an effort to raise the visibility of how humans treat non-human others amongst the general public. In the academy, biologists and ethologists were studying animal behavior and species loss/discovery raising awareness about the experiential lives of animals as well as their perilous existence alongside humans. Social scientists were reassessing {{what it means to be}} a subject and breaking into the black box of nature to explore new understandings of the relations between humans and the rest of the planet. Animal geographers realized there was a whole spectrum of human-animal relations that should be addressed from a geographic perspective. At the forefront of this third wave of <b>animal</b> <b>geography</b> was Tuan’s work on pets in Dominance and Affection and a special topics issue of the journal Environment and Planning D: Society and Space edited by Wolch and Emel.|$|E

As editor, and in various institutional roles, she mentored and encouraged an entire generation of British geographers. She contributed numerous academic works, and unusually even for her time, her geographical interests were wide-ranging, covering essentially every subfield of geography. Her most prominent work was <b>Animal</b> <b>Geography</b> (1913) and others on animal geographies and other areas at the intersection of biology and geography. However she also wrote about political geography (e.g. Aftermath, 1920, an acclaimed work on the aftermath of World War I), travel (Frequented Ways, 1922), and cartography (Ordnance Survey Maps, 1913), among other topics. Among the recognition she received was the Livingstone Gold Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, the Back Award of the Royal Geographical Society (1921) and the presidency of the geographical section of the British Association.|$|E
5000|$|A {{synopsis}} of Ukraine's faunal and flora history was noted in Stephen Rudnicki's Ukraine, the Land and Its People: An Introduction to Its Geography (1912): [...] "Ukraine {{has a much}} more varied plant and <b>animal</b> <b>geography</b> than the proper Russian territory, despite the latter's much greater extent. In Ukraine, the borders of three main divisions of plant-geography of Europe meet—the Mediterranean division, the steppe region, and the forest region, with their transition regions. Besides, we meet in Ukraine three mountain regions—the Carpathian, the Crimean, and the Caucasian. In respect to flora, Ukraine possesses only a few endemic species. To be sure the great ice period covered only comparatively small areas of Ukraine with its glacier, but the polar flora undoubtedly prevailed {{in the entire country}} at that time. After the withdrawal of the glacier, steppes first appeared in its place, which then, especially in the Northwest, were forced to make room for a forest flora that had immigrated from Central Europe and Siberia. Hence, despite the considerable area of Ukraine, so few endemic species. Since those primeval days, only a very few natural changes have occurred in the vegetation of Ukraine. However, man, through his cultural activity, has wrought many changes in the plant-world of the country." ...|$|E

Articles by Lynn on what he terms geoethics and Jones on what he terms an ethics of encounter are {{a good place to}} start. [...] 4. Human identities and animals. How humans use animals to identify themselves as humans or to distinguish between human groups has a fascinating geographical history. Brown and Rasmussen examine the issue of bestiality, Elder et al. explore how animals are used to discriminate against human groups, and Neo studies how ethnicity comes into play with pig production in Malaysia. [...] Others such as Barua argue that the identities of animals may be cosmopolitan, constituted by the circulation of animals and their contact with divergent cultures. These are all excellent case studies. 5. Animals as subjects. One of the most difficult aspects of studying animals is the fact that they can’t talk back to us in human language. Animal geographers have been tackling how, exactly, to address the fact that individuals of other species are experiential entities. Examples include work by Barua on elephants, Bear on fish, Hinchliffe et al. on water voles, and Lorimer on nonhuman charisma.|$|E
5000|$|The {{next big}} project {{on which the}} firm tried its luck was the Physikalischer Atlas atlas of Heinrich Berghaus. The first thematical worldatlas (with the issues meteorology, hydrography, geology, magnetism, plant geography, <b>animal</b> <b>geography,</b> anthropology, ethnography) was {{published}} as a complement for the 5-volume work Kosmos by Alexander von Humboldt. Heinrich Berghaus edited the first two editions himself, while his nephew Hermann Berghaus edited the third edition.Von Humboldt provided Berghaus with much data, that he had acquired during his explorations and Berghaus processed these into physical maps, for which he used many kinds of isolines and {{a whole range of}} new symbols. He liked to project thematical content on top of topographic maps and was also very much interested in the right depiction of heights. Some maps of the first edition carry the signature [...] "drawn and engraved in the ‘Geographische Kunstschule’ Art School at Potsdam". Between 1839 and 1844 he there tutored amongst others August Petermann, Heinrich 'Henry' Lange and his nephew Hermann Berghaus, except for Lange on Berghaus's own pocket. As compensation the pupils had to edit amongst others maps for the Stieler and the Physikalischer Atlas. E.g. this happened with map 2 from issue 2 of the second edition of the Physikalischer Atlas (Hydrography). This shows among other things the discovery of Von Humboldt that the river Casiquiare was the watershed between the rivers Orinoco and Rio Negro.In 1850 the big atlas was converted into a school atlas. This first thematical atlas had such a great influence in its time that the publisher Alexander Keith Johnston requested Berghaus to make some maps for the first part of his Physical atlas of natural phenomena. Though Berghaus did not find the British scientific climate ripe enough for such publications he complied. His criticism was repeated half a century later by J.G. Bartholomew, who declared that British contributions to the geographic sciences mainly lay in ‘search’, while the German contributions mainly lay in ‘research’. For the second part of his atlas Johnston required the cooperation of Heinrich Lange and August Petermann, who therefore moved to Scotland in 1844 and 1845 respectively.|$|E
