5|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} was filmed by British director Sophie Muller in Lake Como, Italy. It features many flashbacks to when Stefani and her former boyfriend were dating, and currently, both <b>are</b> <b>fine</b> with their friendship. The song was {{included on the}} setlist for Stefani's debut tour Harajuku Lovers Tour and the tour's video album, {{as well as in}} the 2010 drama film Somewhere.|$|E
5|$|Although {{happy in}} the company of others, they <b>are</b> <b>fine</b> if left alone. Sealyham Terriers are suited for both the town and country. They can be stubborn, vocal, and boisterous but also full of personality. While they make for loyal family companions, they can be trained to be working dogs, making them {{excellent}} mousers or ratters. They can also be taught as a puppy to get along with other animals, including cats and birds.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the family}} Theraphosidae, which {{includes}} tarantulas and baboon spiders, have urticating hairs on their abdomens and use their legs to flick them at attackers. These hairs <b>are</b> <b>fine</b> setae (bristles) with fragile bases and a row of barbs on the tip. The barbs cause intense irritation {{but there is no}} evidence that they carry any kind of venom. A few defend themselves against wasps by including networks of very robust threads in their webs, giving the spider time to flee while the wasps are struggling with the obstacles. The golden wheeling spider, Carparachne aureoflava, of the Namibian desert escapes parasitic wasps by flipping onto its side and cartwheeling down sand dunes.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is small}} and streamlined, adding to the agility of the cheetah. Saharan cheetah have narrow canine faces. Small, short, and rounded, the ears are marked by black patches on the back; the edges and base of the ears are tawny. The high-set eyes have round pupils. The whiskers, shorter and fewer in number than those of other felids, <b>are</b> <b>fine</b> and inconspicuous. The {{pronounced}} tear streaks are unique to the cheetah. These streaks originate {{from the corner of}} the eyes and run down the nose to the mouth. Their role is obscurethey may be serving as a shield for the eyes against the sun's glare, a helpful feature as the cheetah hunts mainly during the day; another purpose could be to define facial expressions.|$|E
25|$|From {{the top of}} the escarpment, which reaches 1300ft (400m), there <b>are</b> <b>fine</b> {{views of}} the Hudson and Mohawk Valleys as well as {{spectacular}} panoramas of the Adirondacks and Green Mountains of Vermont.|$|E

25|$|Almagyar – This hill in {{the eastern}} part of the town is one of the smart areas of Eger, near the castle. The streets are steep, but there <b>are</b> <b>fine</b> views. The {{southern}} part contains some of the buildings (campus and dormitories) of Eszterházy College.|$|E
25|$|Pellets <b>are</b> <b>fine</b> {{for larger}} snails, but mash {{is better for}} younger ones. Pellets should be {{partially}} crushed if fed to young snails. Snails do not grow well if rabbit pellets are their primary diet. Snails show a distinct preference for moist feed. Easy access to enough water must be ensured if snails are fed dry mash.|$|E
25|$|Blanche is bewildered that Stella {{would go}} back with him after such violence. The next morning, Blanche rushes to Stella and {{describes}} Stanley as a subhuman animal, though Stella assures Blanche that she and Stanley <b>are</b> <b>fine.</b> Stanley overhears the conversation but keeps silent. When Stanley comes in, Stella hugs and kisses him, letting Blanche know that her low opinion of Stanley does not matter.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} side effects <b>are</b> <b>fine</b> tremor, anxiety, headache, muscle cramps, dry mouth, and palpitation. Other {{symptoms}} may include tachycardia, arrhythmia, flushing of the skin, myocardial ischemia (rare), and disturbances {{of sleep and}} behaviour. Rarely occurring, but of importance, are allergic reactions of paradoxical bronchospasms, urticaria (hives), angioedema, hypotension, and collapse. High doses or prolonged use may cause hypokalemia, which is of concern especially in patients with renal failure and those on certain diuretics and xanthine derivatives.|$|E
25|$|The corms, {{which have}} a light purple color due to {{phenolic}} pigments, are roasted, baked or boiled, and the natural sugars give a sweet nutty flavor. The starch is easily digestible, and since the grains <b>are</b> <b>fine</b> and small it is often used for baby food. Young taro leaves and stems can be eaten after boiling twice to remove the acrid flavor and the leaves are {{a good source of}} vitamins A and C and contain more protein than the corms.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the smaller}} sculptural works, {{particularly}} capitals, are Biblical in subject and include scenes of Creation and the Fall of Man, episodes {{from the life of}} Christ and those Old Testament scenes that prefigure his Death and Resurrection, such as Jonah and the Whale and Daniel in the lions' den. Many Nativity scenes occur, the theme of the Three Kings being particularly popular. The cloisters of Santo Domingo de Silos Abbey in Northern Spain, and Moissac <b>are</b> <b>fine</b> examples surviving complete.|$|E
5000|$|For filter bases A, B, and C, if A <b>is</b> <b>finer</b> than B and B <b>is</b> <b>finer</b> than C then A <b>is</b> <b>finer</b> than C. Thus the {{refinement}} relation is a preorder {{on the set}} of filter bases, and {{the passage}} from filter base to filter is an instance of passing from a preordering to the associated partial ordering.|$|R

On January 25, 2015 he <b>was</b> <b>fined</b> $25,000 for what was said to be inappropriate language directed towards a fan during a game against the Phoenix Suns, although Barnes said that it was directed towards the Suns' owner. On May 8, he <b>was</b> <b>fined</b> $50,000 for remarks made to James Harden's mother during a playoff game against the Houston Rockets.|$|R
25|$|While these industrialized methods {{produced}} simple, stylized designs, {{the art of}} hand-painting tiles was not dead, {{as applied}} by Manuel Joaquim de Jesus and especially Luís Ferreira. Luis Ferreira {{was the director of}} the Lisbon factory Viúva Lamego and covered the whole façade of this factory with allegorical scenes. He produced panels, known as Ferreira das Tabuletas, with flower vases, trees, and allegorical figures, applying the trompe-l'oeil technique. These hand-painted panels <b>are</b> <b>fine</b> examples of the eclectic Romantic culture of the late 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The library {{contained}} {{books on}} theology, Islamic law and similar works of scholarship in Ottoman Turkish, Arabic and Persian. The library collection consisted {{of more than}} 3,500 manuscripts. Some <b>are</b> <b>fine</b> examples of inlay work with nacre and ivory. Today these books are kept in the Mosque of the Ağas (Ağalar Camii), which is located {{to the west of}} the library. One of the most important items there is the Topkapi manuscript, a copy of the Qur'an from the time of the third Caliph Uthman Ibn Affan.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time as this foray into the everyday, outlandish {{projects}} were designed such as Ivan Leonidov's Lenin Institute, a high tech work that bears comparison with Buckminster Fuller. This consisted of a skyscraper-sized library, a planetarium and dome, all linked together by a monorail; or Georgy Krutikov's self-explanatory Flying City, an ASNOVA project that was intended as a serious proposal for airborne housing. Melnikov House and his Bakhmetevsky Bus Garage <b>are</b> <b>fine</b> examples of the tensions between individualism and utilitarianism in Constructivism.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, {{the agency}} <b>was</b> <b>fined</b> by the {{government}} (the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia under Slobodan Milošević) for publishing anti-establishment materials.

The <b>fines</b> <b>were</b> denounced by Reporters Without Borders.|$|R
50|$|Chapter 56.1 regulates {{penalties}} for violence towards women. If someone uncovers {{the head of}} a free, unmarried woman, he <b>is</b> <b>fined</b> 6 solidi. If he lifts her dress so that her genitals or her buttocks become visible, he <b>is</b> <b>fined</b> 12 solidi. If he rapes her, he <b>is</b> <b>fined</b> 40 solidi. 56.2 doubles these penalties if the victim is a married woman.|$|R
50|$|In 2007 two further prosecutions {{were brought}} against the CraFarms. Plateau Farms at Reporoa <b>was</b> <b>fined</b> $35,000 for unlawfully {{discharged}} dairy effluent onto land.

The next year a fourth prosecution was upheld when the Taharua Ltd farm on the Rangitaiki Plains <b>was</b> <b>fined</b> $37,500 for an illegal discharge of dairy effluent. This <b>was</b> the largest <b>fine</b> to date for a single prosecution, with the Judge saying it was necessary to send a deterrent to the Crafar group of companies.|$|R
25|$|The {{breeding}} {{goal is a}} hardy, fertile {{horse with}} mental and physical stamina, a good character and lively, balanced temperament. Horses may be suited to any type of riding or driving sport due to expansive, regular paces, a flat-footed walk and vibrant trot and canter. The best heads <b>are</b> <b>fine,</b> dry, and expressive, with a tapering neck and strong topline, withers pronounced and well-laid back, the back strong but flexible, and the croup long, sloping and muscular. The chest and shoulder should have depth and length, respectively. The foundation should be dry on prominent, correct joints and well-shaped hooves.|$|E
25|$|Much of America’s aesthetic, economic, {{and social}} history {{is found in}} works on paper, a {{category}} that includes drawings, prints, and watercolors. The ACMAA began to actively collect works on paper in 1967. The collection today numbers several thousand items by noted artists of the {{nineteenth and twentieth centuries}} to the present. Drawings and paintings range from preliminary studies to fully realized compositions. Most nineteenth-century prints originated as reproductions intended for dissemination to the public and depict subjects relevant to the American experience. Twentieth-century and later prints <b>are</b> <b>fine</b> art prints made by a variety of processes as a means of artistic self-expression.|$|E
25|$|The {{doors of}} the mosques in Cairo were of two kinds; those which, externally, were cased with sheets of bronze or iron, cut out in {{decorative}} patterns, and incised or inlaid, with bosses in relief; and those in wood, which were framed with interlaced designs of the square and diamond, this latter description of work being Coptic in its origin. The {{doors of the}} palace at Palermo, which were made by Saracenic workmen for the Normans, <b>are</b> <b>fine</b> examples and in good preservation. A somewhat similar decorative class of door to these latter is found in Verona, where {{the edges of the}} stiles and rails are beveled and notched.|$|E
2500|$|Paul FINEBaum/The Paul Fine Bucket - The {{show has}} {{a system of}} {{monetary}} fines in place for conversational misdemeanors.
