40|$|A nongravimetric <b>acetyl</b> <b>bromide</b> lignin (ABL) {{method was}} {{evaluated}} to quantify lignin concentration {{in a variety}} of plant materials. The traditional approach to lignin quantification required extraction of lignin with acidic dioxane and its isolation from each plant sample to construct a standard curve via spectrophotometric analysis. Lignin concentration was then measured in pre-extracted plant cell walls. However, this presented a methodological complexity because extraction and isolation procedures are lengthy and tedious, particularly if there are many samples involved. This work was targeted to simplify lignin quantification. Our hypothesis was that any lignin, regardless of its botanical origin, could be used to construct a standard curve for the purpose of determining lignin concentration {{in a variety of}} plants. To test our hypothesis, lignins were isolated from a range of diverse plants and, along with three commercial lignins, standard curves were built and compared among them. Slopes and intercepts derived from these standard curves were close enough to allow utilization of a mean extinction coefficient in the regression equation to estimate : lignin concentration in any plant, independent of its botanical origin. Lignin quantification by use of a common regression equation obviates the steps of lignin extraction, isolation, and standard curve construction, which substantially expedites the ABL method. <b>Acetyl</b> <b>bromide</b> lignin method is a fast, convenient analytical procedure that may routinely be used to quantify lignin.

The {{method for}} {{fractioning}} -various humus complexes, which isdescribed in this paper, is essentially {{based on the}} differences betweentheir physical properties. especially their degree of dispersion, theirsensibility to the action of electrolytes {{and the nature of}} their associationwith the mineral colloids It has been thus possible to separatethree main groups of complexes. The pre-humus complexes are dispersed, and the nearest to certinoriginal constituents of the vegetal tissues, and not easily decomposed. As they are soluble in the <b>acetyl</b> <b>bromide,</b> different inthat from the true humic acids, it was possible to appreciate themattantitatively. The a complexes (brown humic acids) are still lightly coloured andloosely tied to clay. They can be extracted by means of dilute soda. even when clay is flocculated. therefore in the presence of KC 1 inthe sodic solution. The b complexes (grey humic acids) are much darker and closelytied to clay. They can be ext-acted by dilute soda only when clayis completely dispersed, consequently in the absence of KC 1. Besides,they are only partly soluble in soda, but this solubility seems to beincreased by a preliminary treatment with <b>acetyl</b> <b>bromide.</b> These three groups of complexes are found in variable proportionthe different humus types. The pre-humus compounds characterizethe « Mor », which is slowly decomposed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{accurate}} and reproducible determination of lignin molar mass by using {{size exclusion chromatography}} (SEC) is challenging. The lignin association effects, known to dominate underivatized lignins, have been thoroughly addressed by reaction with <b>acetyl</b> <b>bromide</b> in an excess of glacial acetic acid. The combination of a concerted acetylation {{with the introduction of}} bromine within the lignin alkyl side chains is thought to be responsible for the observed excellent solubilization characteristics acetobromination imparts to a variety of lignin samples. The proposed methodology was compared and contrasted to traditional lignin derivatization methods. In addition, side reactions that could possibly be induced under the acetobromination conditions were explored with native softwood (milled wood lignin, MWL) and technical (kraft) lignin. These efforts lend support toward the use of room temperature acetobromination being a facile, effective, and universal lignin derivatization medium proposed to be employed prior to SEC measurements...|$|E

Basic density was calculated by dividing oven-dried weight by green volume. Small wood blocks [5 (L) ×[*] 5 (R)[*]×[*] 5 (T) mm) containing the current or preceding annual rings were collected from the upper and lower sides of inclined stems or branches. Transverse sections of 15 µm in thickness were sliced with a sliding microtome (ROM- 380, Yamatokohki). The sections were stained with 1 % safranin in 50 % ethanol to determine the vessel frequency. In the case of ring-porous wood, vessel frequency was determined in the outer-pore zone. To detect the G-layer, transverse sections were stained with a zinc chloride–iodine solution and mounted in a 50 % glycerol solution. Lignin content was determined by the <b>acetyl</b> <b>bromide</b> method [23].|$|E

This study investigated biological treatment of paper mill sludge and lignin degradation by fungi. Four different Basidiomycetes white-rot fungi (WRF) were used: Coriolus versicolor, Tyromyces albidus, Trametes gallica and Pleurotus ostreatus. The fungi were cultured in submerged fermentation cultures with paper mill sludge. The pH values of the cultures and ligninolytic enzymes production profiles of the four fungi were monitored and reported here. The highest laccase activity of 202 U/L was obtained in T. albidus at day 25 while the maximum manganese-dependent peroxidase (MnP) activity of 50 U/L was obtained in C. versicolor from day 15 to 25. The P. ostreatus showed highest total cellulase activity with the peak of 0. 26 μmol at day 15 while the other three WRF showed negligible total cellulase activity. The lignin contents were significantly decreased in the four WRF-treated sludge samples and were confirmed by <b>acetyl</b> <b>bromide</b> and FTIR analyses. The results suggested that lignin was preferentially used an...|$|E
