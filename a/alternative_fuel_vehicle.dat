5|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an <b>alternative</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicle</b> with an {{internal}} combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or hydrogen.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we have {{investigated}} the cost-effectiveness of <b>alternative</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> as a measure for CO 2 reduction. Computed {{results indicate that the}} installation of <b>alternative</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> is much more expensive than fuel switching in industry or the power generation sector. However, some economic incentives will make the price go down to the level at which <b>alternative</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> are competitive with conventional vehicles. At the same time, mass production makes their prices go down although it is rather expensive at present. Then we developed the scenarios in which CO 2 emissions could be stabilized at the level in 1990. In the higher demand case (1. 2 %/yr.), it is indispensable to introduce <b>alternative</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> into the market. Our model selects electric vehicles and compressed natural gas vehicles as cost-effective options. In the scenario where carbon tax revenue is not offset by subsidy, we have to impose prohibitively high carbon tax to suppress CO 2. However, CO 2 emission can be suppressed by a reasonable carbon tax if the tax revenue is returned to the market to subsidize <b>alternative</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> and their infrastructures...|$|R
