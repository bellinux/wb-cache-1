5000|$|The <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometer</b> was the earliest, efficient, modern-style {{instrument}} of temperature measurement. As {{is the case}} with many early, important inventions, there are several people credited with its invention. These include Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who in 1654 made sealed tubes part filled with alcohol or urine, with a bulb and stem, depending on the expansion of a liquid, and independent of air pressure. [...] Other sources, including the Encyclopædia Britannica, credit German scientist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit with inventing the <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometer</b> in 1709. Fahrenheit was a skilled glassblower and his <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometer</b> was the world's first reliable thermometer.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{discovery}} of the true thermodynamic temperature, the thermometer defined the temperature; thermometers made with different materials would define different temperature scales (a coloured <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometer</b> would give a slightly different reading than a mercury thermometer at, say half-scale). In practice, several materials gave very similar temperatures to each other and, when discovered, to the thermodynamic temperature.|$|E
5000|$|The alcohol [...] is an {{alternative}} to the mercury-in-glass thermometer and has similar functions. Unlike the mercury-in-glass thermometer, the contents of an <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometer</b> are less toxic and will evaporate away fairly quickly. The ethanol version is the most widely used due to the low cost and relatively low hazard posed by the liquid in case of breakage.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{low melting}} point (−114.14°C) and low toxicity, ethanol is {{sometimes}} used in laboratories (with dry ice or other coolants) as a cooling bath to keep vessels at temperatures below the freezing point of water. For the same reason, {{it is also}} used as the active fluid in <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometers.</b>|$|R
5|$|Most {{thermometers}} now use pigmented alcohol {{instead of}} mercury, and galinstan alloy thermometers are also an option. Mercury thermometers are still occasionally {{used in the}} medical field {{because they are more}} accurate than <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometers,</b> though both are commonly being replaced by electronic thermometers and less commonly by galinstan thermometers. Mercury thermometers are still widely used for certain scientific applications because of their greater accuracy and working range.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} thermometer is a {{glass tube}} with a bulb {{at one end}} containing a liquid which expands {{in a uniform manner}} with temperature. The tube itself is narrow (capillary) and has calibration markings along it. The liquid is often mercury, but <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometers</b> use a colored alcohol. Medically, a maximum thermometer is often used, which indicates the maximum temperature reached even after it is removed from the body.|$|R
50|$|Different {{empirical}} scales may not {{be compatible}} with each other, except for small regions of temperature overlap. If an <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometer</b> and a mercury thermometer have same two fixed points, namely the freezing and boiling point of water, their reading will not agree with each other except at the fixed points, as the linear 1:1 relationship of expansion between any two thermometric substances {{may not be}} guaranteed.|$|E
50|$|An {{expedition}} to Vanikoro in 1999 dived on the wrecks of Boussole and Astrolabe, finding a Graphometer {{similar to one}} found at Numbo in 1885. This follows finds of a silver fork with the coat of arms of Fleuriot de Langle, a Louis d'or, Spanish and Russian coins, an <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometer,</b> a ship's whistle, part of a bilge pump, an anchor, a cask of dragon, a crucifix, a human statue, ship's débris, a copper sieve, musket balls, an engraved domino, bottles, pitchers, goblets, trivial trade items and officers' medals and high collars.|$|E
5000|$|Ethanol-filled {{thermometers}} {{are used}} in preference to mercury for meteorological measurements of minimum temperatures {{and can be used}} down to −70 °C (-94 °F). [...] The physical limitation of the ability of a thermometer to measure low temperature is the freezing point of the liquid used. Ethanol freezes at −114.9 °C (−174.82 °F). If an <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometer</b> utilizes a combination of ethyl alcohol, toluene, and pentane, its lower temperature range may be extended to measure temperatures down to as low as −200 °C (-328 °F). [...] However, the measurement temperature range c. −200 °C to 78 °C, is highly dependent upon the type of alcohol used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alcohol</b> <b>thermometers,</b> {{infrared}} thermometers, mercury-in-glass thermometers, recording thermometers, thermistors, and Six's thermometers {{are used}} in meteorology and climatology in various levels of the atmosphere and oceans. Aircraft use thermometers and hygrometers to determine if atmospheric icing conditions exist along their flight path. These measurements are used to initialize weather forecast models. Thermometers {{are used in}} roadways in cold weather climates to help determine if icing conditions exist and indoors in climate control systems.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{calibrate}} the thermometer, the bulb {{is made to}} reach thermal equilibrium with a temperature standard such as an ice/water mixture, and then with another standard such as water/vapour, and the tube is divided into regular intervals between the fixed points. In principle, thermometers made of different material (e.g., coloured <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometers)</b> {{might be expected to}} give different intermediate readings due to different expansion properties; in practice the substances used are chosen to have reasonably linear expansion characteristics as a function of true thermodynamic temperature, and so give similar results.|$|R
25|$|Aquarium heaters {{combine a}} heating element with a thermostat, {{allowing}} the aquarist to regulate water temperature at a level above that of the surrounding air, whereas coolers and chillers (refrigeration devices) are for use anywhere, such as cold water aquaria, where the ambient room temperature is above the desired tank temperature. Thermometers used include glass <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometers,</b> adhesive external plastic strip thermometers, and battery-powered LCD thermometers. In addition, some aquarists use air pumps attached to airstones or water pumps to increase water circulation and supply adequate gas exchange at the water surface. Wave-making devices have also been constructed to provide wave action.|$|R
5000|$|Peter Sinks was {{discovered}} meteorologically by Utah State University student Zane Stephens in 1983. Stephens, {{along with the}} Utah Climate Center, placed measuring instruments in the valley {{in the winter of}} 1984. On February 1, 1985, Peter Sinks dropped to , while another nearby valley, Middle Sink, located 3 mi to the north-east, dropped to [...] Stephens hiked into Middle Sink to record the temperature personally. He then flew into Peter Sinks in a KUTV television station helicopter with broadcasting Meteorologist Mark Eubank. State Climatologist Gayle Bingham also traveled to the area and confirmed the temperature. The <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometer</b> being used was retrieved and sent to the Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C. to confirm the temperature.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{particular}} men who switched out {{water for}} {{alcohol in the}} thermometer. The earliest is Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany (1610-1670), who created an enclosed thermometer that used alcohol circa 1654. Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686-1736), a Polish-born Dutch physicist, engineer, and glass blower, made contributions to thermometers as well. He created an <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometer</b> in 1709 and later innovated the mercury thermometer in 1714. Mercury, he found, responded more quickly to temperature changes than the previously used water. Fahrenheit also created the temperature scale which is named after him, having recorded the system in 1724. The scale is still only mainly used for everyday applications in the United States, its territories and associated states (all served by the U.S. National Weather Service) {{as well as the}} Bahamas, Belize, and the Cayman Islands.|$|E
30|$|Inductive {{magnetic}} heating (hyperthermia) {{experiment was}} conducted by using high-frequency magnetic field (HFMF) system as the method reported previously with minor modification [1, 3, 36]. Briefly, the samples were positioned {{to the center of}} copper coil in the HFMF generator for 30  min. The change of the temperature was recorded by an <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometer.</b> PBS was used as a control. Each experiment was performed triplicate.|$|E
50|$|Mercury also {{enters into}} the {{environment}} through the improper disposal (e.g., land filling, incineration) of certain products. Products containing mercury include: auto parts, batteries, fluorescent bulbs, medical products, thermometers, and thermostats. Due to health concerns (see below), toxics use reduction efforts are cutting back or eliminating mercury in such products. For example, most thermometers now use pigmented alcohol instead of mercury. Mercury thermometers are still occasionally used in the medical field {{because they are more}} accurate than <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometers,</b> though both are being replaced by electronic thermometers. Mercury thermometers are still widely used for certain scientific applications because of their greater accuracy and working range.|$|R
5000|$|Some liquids possess {{relatively}} high expansion coefficients over a useful temperature ranges thus forming {{the basis for}} an <b>alcohol</b> or mercury <b>thermometer.</b> Alternative designs using this principle are the reversing thermometer and Beckmann differential thermometer.|$|R
2500|$|The coldest {{location}} in the Northern Hemisphere {{is not in the}} Arctic, but rather in the interior of Russia's Far East, in the upper-right quadrant of the maps. [...] This is due to the region's continental climate, far from the moderating influence of the ocean, and to the valleys in the region that can trap cold, dense air and create strong temperature inversions, where the temperature increases, rather than decreases, with height (Serreze and Barry, 2005). [...] The lowest officially recorded temperature in the Northern Hemisphere is the subject of controversy, due to the type of instrumentation used. These temperatures were measured by spirit thermometer, which is less accurate than a mercury thermometer. [...] Measurement by spirit (<b>alcohol)</b> <b>thermometers</b> must be corrected (usually the correction is positive, being about 0.2°C, but it is not so simple). According to [...] "Climate of the USSR, issue 24, part I, Leningrad, 1956," [...] the coldest temperature of −67.7°C (−90°F) occurred in Oymyakon on 6 February 1933, as well as in Verkhoyansk on 5 and 7 February 1892, respectively. [...] However, this region {{is not part of the}} Arctic because its continental climate also allows it to have warm summers, with an average July temperature of 15°C (59°F). [...] In the figure below showing station climatologies, the plot for Yakutsk is representative of this part of the Far East; Yakutsk has a slightly less extreme climate than Verkhoyansk.|$|R
30|$|Hyperthermia {{experiment}} was performed as the method reported previously with minor modification [32]. Adiabatic condition is assumed, where the initial {{temperature of the}} sample must be equal to {{the temperature of the}} surrounding medium [33]. Therefore, the temperature of the surrounding medium was kept constant using a heated chamber at 37 °C then the initial temperature was 37 °C for all of the measurements. Briefly, CAMNP and or DOX-loaded magnetic liposomes suspension were subjected to the center of copper coil in the HFMF apparatus for 10  min. The change of the temperature was recorded every 2  min by an <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometer.</b> Each {{experiment was}} performed three times.|$|E
40|$|In {{justice to}} those who have been {{responsible}} for the progress of orthopaedic surgery up to the present time, we should consider its needs for corresponding advancement in the future. Let us illustrate by a comparison with the development of other phases of medicine. The leaning tower of Pisa recalls the unchastened spirit of Galileo’ leaving the University to become professor of mathematics at the Univer-sity of Padua in 1592. That. which probably represents the first <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometer</b> was the result of his initial efforts in his new position. Although evidence is scarce, it suggests that nearly two hundred years elapsed before the recording of body temperature was made possible through the development of the mercurial thermometer by Fahrenheit 2, 3 about 1714. The Vienna school of medicine began to flourish, under the influence of van Swieten 4, about 1750. It is recorded that he first placed the clinical thermometer in the mouth of medicine amidst criticism which was softened only by the favor of Maria Theresa and Joseph II. Feve...|$|E

50|$|He {{devised a}} {{portable}} barometer {{for use in}} geological expeditions. His Recherches sur les modifications de l'atmosphère (2 vols. 4to, Geneva, 1772; 2nd ed., 4 vols. Paris, 1784) contain experiments on moisture, evaporation and the indications of hygrometers and thermometers. He applied the barometer to the determination of heights. The Philosophical Transactions published his account of a new hygrometer, which resembled a mercurial thermometer, with an ivory bulb, which expanded by moisture, and caused the mercury to descend. He later devised a whalebone hygrometer which sparked a bitter controversy with Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, himself inventor of a hair hygrometer. He gave the first correct rules for measuring heights {{with the help of}} a barometer. Deluc advocated the use of mercury, instead of <b>alcohol,</b> in <b>thermometers.</b>|$|R

At the summit, their aneroid barometer read 13.175 inches, their boiling-point thermometer read 174.9 degrees, their mercurial barometer read 13.617 inches. The <b>alcohol</b> minimum recording <b>thermometer</b> read 7 °F. These measurements, with others taken at Fort Gibbon and Valdez, were reduced by C. E. Griffin, Topographic Engineer of the United States Geological Survey, to produce an elevation for Denali of 20,384 feet. The precise figure measured by the United States Geological Survey in 2015 is 20,310 feet.|$|R
30|$|As ADC is {{temperature}} dependent [21], it {{was important}} to understand the temperature behaviour of the ex-vivo lamb leg samples before and after sonication. Room temperature was measured using a standard <b>alcohol</b> <b>thermometer.</b> All other temperature measurements were made from a PRFS thermometry sequence using an echo planar imaging (EPI) accelerated, multi-slice two-dimensional gradient-echo T 1 -weighted sequence, acquired as a dynamic series (repetition time 25 ms, echo time 16 ms, flip angle 18 o, EPI factor 11, fat suppression ProSet, number of signal averages 2, voxel size 2.1 × 2.1 × 7.0 mm 3, field of view 400 × 300 mm 2, dynamic scan time 3 s). Data were obtained from three 7  mm thick slices automatically placed orthogonally through the treatment focus. In lamb leg number 1, six separate 1 min acquisitions of PRFS data (23 dynamics) were first performed in each of three separate cortical locations to determine the stability and accuracy of the PRFS predicted temperature. This was compared to the measured room/lamb leg temperature. The same sequence was then acquired before, during, and after sonication of a 4 and 12  mm cell at the maximum power permissible at each cell size (190 W for the 4  mm cell, 80 W for the 12  mm cell). Data were obtained for the maximum cooling period for which temperature data were available.|$|E
