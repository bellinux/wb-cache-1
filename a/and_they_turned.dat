25|$|The {{industrial}} revolution {{first appeared in}} textiles, including cotton and especially silk, which was based in home workshops in rural areas. By the 1890s, Japanese textiles dominated the home markets and competed successfully with British products in China and India, as well. Japanese shippers were competing with European traders to carry these goods across Asia and even to Europe. As in the West, the textile mills employed mainly women, half of them under age twenty. They were sent there by their fathers, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> over their wages to their fathers. Japan largely skipped water power and moved straight to steam powered mills, which were more productive, and which created a demand for coal.|$|E
25|$|In January 1987, Ralphy Rodriguez {{replaced}} Charlie just as {{the group}} began facing internal conflicts. First, Robi quit without warning {{in the middle of}} a Brazilian tour, becoming the second member to quit voluntarily. Apparently, he had written a song and presented the idea to management <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> him down, supposedly mocking him, which prompted him to leave; they did this so they could use his song without compensating him. Robi's lawyer prevented them from using his song. Also, the group was dropped from RCA International due to low record sales, so they signed a contract with Melody International Mexico. Charlie was asked to return to the group to complete the Brazilian tour and to embark on the Summer in the Street U.S. tour and introduce new member Rubén Gómez.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the invasion, {{remnants}} of the Royal Yugoslav Army organized the Serbian monarchist Chetniks as the first resistance movement. The Chetniks were led by Draža Mihailović and were recognized by the Yugoslav government-in-exile. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia refrained from open conflict with the Axis forces while the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union was in effect. Following the start of Operation Barbarossa, the Communist-led Yugoslav Partisans issued their call for an uprising. Josip Broz Tito was the supreme commander of the Partisan forces. The Chetniks and the Partisans, the two main guerrilla resistance units, initially cooperated against the Axis, but their cooperation soon fell apart <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> against each other. The Chetniks started to collaborate with the Axis and Allied support shifted to the Partisan side.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} {{on the morning of}} the day before Yom Kippur, they placed the High Priest at the Eastern Gate and brought before him oxen, rams, and sheep, so that he could become {{familiar}} with the service. The rest of the seven days, they did not withhold food or drink from him, but near nightfall on the eve of Yom Kippur, they would not let him eat much, as food might make him sleep. The sages of the court took him up to the house of Avtinas and handed him over to the elders of the priesthood. As the sages of the court took their leave, they cautioned him that he was the messenger of the court, and adjured him in God's Name that he not change anything in the service from what they had told him.

25|$|The Badgers {{took the}} opening drive {{of the second}} half and moved into the Gamecocks red zone but would be forced to settle for a 35–yard field goal by K Jack Russell. South Carolina got the ball for their first second half drive. On their first play, Connor Shaw {{scrambled}} for 8 yards but fumbled after he was hit by Badgers LB Derek Landisch. The ball was recovered by fellow Badgers LB Ethan Armstrong. Wisconsin started at the South Carolina 31–yard line but failed to move the ball into the red zone and were forced to try a field goal. The kick from Jack Russell was wide right from 42 yards. South Carolina then drove 75 yards scoring on a 22–yard touchdown pass to Bruce Ellington from Connor Shaw. On the first play of the Badgers next drive, QB Joel Stave would scamble for 5 yards but was hit hard by a South Carolina defender. A few plays later after handing the ball off, Stave would be forced to leave the game with a shoulder injury. Taking over at quarterback for the Badgers was sixth year senior Curt Phillips. The third quarter would come to a close with the Badgers moving into Gamecock territory. On fourth and one from the South Carolina 26–yard line, Wisconsin decided to go for the first down instead to try a 40 plus yard field goal. The Gamecocks defense stuffed the Badgers <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> the ball over on down. Six plays later, South Carolina extended their lead with a 3–yard touchdown pass to Jerell Adams from Connor Shaw. However, the Badgers would strike quickly on the ensuring kickoff. Badgers kick returner, Kenzel Doe, returned the kickoff 91 yards for a touchdown. The return was highlighted with a stiff arm that sprung Doe for the score. The Badgers were within three with just under 11 minutes left in the game. Once again, South Carolina would answer this time a 9 play 88 yard drive capped by a 1–yard touchdown run by Connor Shaw on a QB sneak. The Badgers then took over and got to the Gamecocks 47–yard line before Curt Phillips was intercepted. With less than five minutes left, the Gamecocks took over. Wisconsin LB Conor O'Neill then forced a fumble that was recovered by CB Darius Hillary. The Badgers then moved the ball to the Gamecocks 16–yard line but again backup QB Curt Phillips was intercepted. The Badgers defense would force the Gamecocks to punt and the Badgers took over with 2:10 left in the game still down by 10 points. Wisconsin got down to South Carolina's 17–yard line but the Badgers tried a trick play with a screen to WR Jared Abbrederis who then attempted to pitch the ball to RB Melvin Gordon but he mishandled the ball and fumbled turning the ball over to South Carolina. Two kneel downs later and the game was over with a South Carolina victory over Wisconsin, 34–24.|$|E

It detonated some of the ready-use ammunition, starting a fire that burnt out the casemate and killed its crew. That was, however, the only hit on Goeben, although it caused her to disengage from the Russian squadron.

Orestes refused their petition, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> to Odoacer to lead their revolt against Orestes. Orestes was killed at Placentia and his brother Paulus outside Ravenna.

In 476 Odoacer advanced to Ravenna and captured the city, compelling the young emperor Romulus to abdicate on September 4.

The Medical Society of New Jersey and the Urological Society of New Jersey both opposed any court ordered medical treatment. As the parties came to an agreement, no precedent was set. In June 2001 a Nevada court settled a dispute over circumcision between two parents but put a strict gag order on the terms of the settlement. In July 2001 a dispute between parents in Kansas over circumcision was resolved when the mother's request to have the infant circumcised was withdrawn. In this case the father opposed circumcision while the mother asserted that not circumcising the child was against her religious beliefs.

2500|$|Located on the Jacobite extreme {{left wing}} were the Macdonald regiments.

When the Macdonalds charged, their progress was much slower than that {{of the rest of the}} Jacobite forces. Standing on the right of these regiments were the much smaller units of Chisholms and the combined unit of Macleans and Maclachlans. Every officer in the Chisholm unit was killed or wounded and Col. Lachlan Maclachlan, who led the combined unit of Macleans and Maclachlans, was gruesomely killed by a cannon shot. As the Macdonalds suffered casualties they began to give way. Immediately Cumberland then pressed the advantage, ordering two troops of Cobham's 10th Dragoons to ride them down.
