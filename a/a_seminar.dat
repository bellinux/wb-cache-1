5|$|According to {{researcher}} Ibrahim Al-Khulaifi, {{there were}} three stages {{in the production of}} the show. The first stage was pre-production research, which identified basic education needs for {{children under the age of}} six. The second stage involved the creation of a pilot reel to test children on the show's effects and for review by educators, sociologists, psychologists, and other experts, who were invited to <b>a</b> <b>seminar.</b> Finally, the series was filmed and aired. Research began in August 1977; the team was led by an educator and included a linguist and a psychologist, all of whom were on the faculty of Kuwait University. The show was tested on different socioeconomic groups of children, between the ages of three and six, in kindergartens and preschools in four representative cities from Arab countries. The team proposed curriculum goals based upon the research and, during <b>a</b> <b>seminar,</b> Arab and CTW educators agreed on ten final goals.|$|E

He was accepted as a guest member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Association, becoming a regular member in October 1920, and began his own analysis with Isidor Sadger. He lived and worked out of an apartment on Berggasse 7, the street on which Freud lived at no. 19, in the Alsergrund area of Vienna.|$|E
