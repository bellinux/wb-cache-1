500|$|Every year {{we change}} fewer wheels, because the {{wheels and tyres}} <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> and better. We changed about 20 wheels today. Five years ago, it was much worse— we'd be {{choosing}} about a hundred. Tyres are becoming much better than before. So, yes, our job is easier— except that the race generally goes faster now, so we're under a bit more pressure. Every year, there's new types of gears, new aluminium frames, new titanium frames, so it's getting more complex for us to offer neutral service. We have a list in the car of who is riding Mavic or Shimano or Campagnolo; the moment someone gets a flat tyre {{we need to think}} of a lot of things at once. Is it a titanium frame or a carbon frame or a steel frame? ...|$|E
