5|$|Gallium maltolate, an oral, highly <b>absorbable</b> form of gallium(III) ion, is an anti-proliferative to pathologically proliferating cells, {{particularly}} {{cancer cells}} and some bacteria that accept {{it in place}} of ferric iron (Fe3+). Researchers are conducting clinical and preclinical trials on this compound as a potential treatment {{for a number of}} cancers, infectious diseases, and inflammatory diseases.|$|E
5|$|In soil, {{microorganisms}} that {{reside in}} the rhizosphere (a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily <b>absorbable</b> form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise vitamins, such as folic acid, vitamin K and biotin, convert sugars to lactic acid (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through competitive exclusion) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements.|$|E
25|$|If defined {{strictly}} {{as having}} local effect, the topical {{route of administration}} can also include enteral administration of medications that are poorly <b>absorbable</b> by the gastrointestinal tract. One poorly <b>absorbable</b> antibiotic is vancomycin, which is recommended by mouth {{as a treatment for}} severe Clostridium difficile colitis.|$|E

25|$|The {{preparation}} of maize in an alkaline solution of mineral lime or calcium hydroxide, {{used in the}} production of flour for corn tortillas, significantly enriches the nutritional value of maize as a source of vitamins, minerals and protein. The limewater used in the process adds its own bioavailable calcium, while it also renders the B vitamins and amino acids in maize far more easily <b>absorbable</b> by the human digestive system.|$|E
25|$|Orlistat {{works by}} {{inhibiting}} gastric and pancreatic lipases, the enzymes that break down triglycerides in the intestine. When lipase activity is blocked, triglycerides from the diet are not hydrolyzed into <b>absorbable</b> free fatty acids, and instead are excreted unchanged. Only trace amounts of orlistat are absorbed systemically; the primary effect is local lipase inhibition within the GI tract after an oral dose. The primary route of elimination {{is through the}} feces.|$|E
25|$|The large {{intestine}} absorbs water and any remaining <b>absorbable</b> nutrients {{from the food}} before sending the indigestible matter to the rectum. The colon absorbs vitamins that are created by the colonic bacteria, such as vitamin K (especially important as the daily ingestion of vitamin K is not normally enough to maintain adequate blood coagulation), vitamin B12, thiamine and riboflavin. It also compacts feces, and stores fecal matter in the rectum until it can be discharged via the anus in defecation.|$|E
25|$|The glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load {{concepts}} {{have been}} developed to characterize food behavior during human digestion. They rank carbohydrate-rich foods based on the rapidity and magnitude of their effect on blood glucose levels. Glycemic index is a measure of how quickly food glucose is absorbed, while glycemic load {{is a measure of the}} total <b>absorbable</b> glucose in foods. The insulin index is a similar, more recent classification method that ranks foods based on their effects on blood insulin levels, which are caused by glucose (or starch) and some amino acids in food.|$|E
25|$|A passive trap, pitfall traps attract prey with nectar bribes {{secreted}} by the peristome {{and bright}} flower-like anthocyanin patterning within the pitcher. The linings of most pitcher plants {{are covered in}} a loose coating of waxy flakes which are slippery for insects, causing them {{to fall into the}} pitcher. Once within the pitcher structure, digestive enzymes or mutualistic species break down the prey into an <b>absorbable</b> form for the plant. Water can become trapped within the pitcher, making a habitat for other flora and fauna. This type of 'water body' is called a Phytotelma.|$|E
25|$|Pellagra is {{most common}} to populations within {{developing}} {{countries in which}} corn is the dietary staple. The disease has virtually disappeared from industrialized countries, yet still appears in India and parts of China and Africa. This is {{in part due to}} the bound form of niacin that unprocessed corn contains, which is not readily absorbed into the human body. The processes involved in making corn tortillas, can release the bound niacin into a more <b>absorbable</b> form. Pellegra is not problematic in countries which traditionally prepare their corn in this way, but is a problem in other countries where unprocessed corn is main source of caloric intake.|$|E
25|$|Ketamine is <b>absorbable</b> by intravenous, intramuscular, oral, and topical routes due to {{both its}} water and lipid solubilities. When {{administered}} orally, it undergoes first-pass metabolism, {{where it is}} biotransformed in the liver by CYP3A4 (major), CYP2B6 (minor), and CYP2C9 (minor) isoenzymes into norketamine (through N-demethylation) and finally dehydronorketamine. Intermediate in the biotransformation of norketamine into dehydronorketamine is the hydroxylation of norketamine into hydroxynorketamine by CYP2B6 and CYP2A6. Dehydronorketamine, followed by norketamine, is the most prevalent metabolite detected in urine. As the major metabolite of ketamine, norketamine is one-third to one-fifth as potent as an anesthetic, and plasma levels of this metabolite are three times higher than ketamine following oral administration. Bioavailability through the oral route reaches 17–20%; bioavailability through other routes are: 93% intramuscularly, 25–50% intranasally, 30% sublingually, and 30% rectally. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within a minute intravenously, 5–15 min intramuscularly, and 30 min orally. Ketamine's duration of action in a clinical setting is 30 min to 2 h intramuscularly and 4–6 h orally.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of {{infectious}} diarrhea is by improved sanitation, clean drinking water, and hand washing with soap. Breastfeeding {{for at least}} six months is also recommended as is vaccination against rotavirus. Oral rehydration solution (ORS), which is clean water with modest amounts of salts and sugar, is the treatment of choice. Zinc tablets are also recommended. These treatments have been estimated to have saved 50 million children in the past 25 years. When people have diarrhea it is recommended that they continue to eat healthy food and babies continue to be breastfed. If commercial ORS are not available, homemade solutions may be used. In those with severe dehydration, intravenous fluids may be required. Most cases; however, can be managed well with fluids by mouth. Osmotic diarrhea can also be the result of maldigestion (e.g., pancreatic disease or Coeliac disease), in which the nutrients are left in the lumen to pull in water. Or it can be caused by osmotic laxatives (which work to alleviate constipation by drawing water into the bowels). In healthy individuals, too much magnesium or vitamin C or undigested lactose can produce osmotic diarrhea and distention of the bowel. A person who has lactose intolerance can have difficulty absorbing lactose after an extraordinarily high intake of dairy products. In persons who have fructose malabsorption, excess fructose intake can also cause diarrhea. High-fructose foods that also have a high glucose content are more <b>absorbable</b> and less likely to cause diarrhea. Sugar alcohols such as sorbitol (often found in sugar-free foods) are difficult for the body to absorb and, in large amounts, may lead to osmotic diarrhea. In most of these cases, osmotic diarrhea stops when the offending agent (e.g. milk, sorbitol) is stopped.|$|E

500|$|The pitfall traps of protocarnivorous {{plants are}} {{identical}} to those of carnivorous plants in every way except in the plant's mode of digestion. The rigid definition of carnivory in plants requires digestion of prey by enzymes produced by the plant. Given this criterion, many of the pitfall trap plants commonly considered to be carnivorous would instead be classified as protocarnivorous. However, this is highly contentious and generally not reflected in current carnivorous plant phylogenies or literature. [...] Darlingtonia californica and several Heliamphora species do not produce their own enzymes, relying instead on an internal food web {{to break down the}} prey into <b>absorbable</b> nutrients.|$|E

2500|$|A {{new method}} to reduce rectal {{radiation}} injury in prostate cancer patients {{involves the use}} of an <b>absorbable</b> spacer placed between the prostate and rectum. [...] Such spacers are commercially available in some regions, and are undergoing clinical trials in others. [...] By temporarily altering [...] the anatomy these products have the potential to allow for improved cancer targeting while minimizing risk to neighboring healthy tissues. [...] Prostate Rectum Spacers should be compatible with all prostate cancer radiotherapy treatments including 3D conformal, IMRT and stereotactic radiation and brachytherapy.|$|E

The cartilage surface {{on the top of the}} outside (lateral side) of the shinbone is left intact. [...] The top of the shinbone is then lowered on the outside and attached with surgical staples or screws, depending on the size of the wedge that was removed. [...] The layers of tissue in the knee are stitched together, usually with <b>absorbable</b> sutures.|$|E
2500|$|One {{upconversion}} {{technique is}} to incorporate lanthanide-doped materials ( [...] , , [...] or a combination), {{taking advantage of}} their luminescence to convert infrared radiation to visible light. Upconversion process occurs when two infrared photons are absorbed by rare-earth ions to generate a (high-energy) <b>absorbable</b> photon. As example, the energy transfer upconversion process (ETU), consists in successive transfer processes between excited ions in the near infrared. The upconverter material could be placed below the solar cell to absorb the infrared light that passes through the silicon. Useful ions are most commonly found in the trivalent state. [...] ions {{have been the most}} used. [...] ions absorb solar radiation around 1.54µm. Two [...] ions that have absorbed this radiation can interact with each other through an upconversion process. The excited ion emits light above the Si bandgap that is absorbed by the solar cell and creates an additional electron–hole pair that can generate current. However, the increased efficiency was small. In addition, fluoroindate glasses have low phonon energy and have been proposed as suitable matrix doped with [...] ions.|$|E
50|$|All sutures are {{classified}} as either <b>absorbable</b> or non-absorbable {{depending on whether the}} body will naturally degrade and absorb the suture material over time. <b>Absorbable</b> suture materials include the original catgut as well as the newer synthetics polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, polydioxanone, and caprolactone. <b>Absorbable</b> (or resorbable) medical devices such as sutures are made of polymers. The polymer materials are based on one or more of five cyclic monomers: glycolide, l-lactide, p-dioxanone, trimethylene carbonate and ε-caprolactone.|$|E
