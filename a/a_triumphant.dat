5|$|Larsson was {{commissioned}} to decorate all {{the walls of}} the central staircase in the museum except for one, and he wanted to decorate the last wall as well. He intended the last wall to present a contrast to the other illustrations of the staircase. Whereas the painting Gustav Vasa enters Stockholm 1523 presented a midsummer theme with <b>a</b> <b>triumphant</b> king, Larsson wanted the last illustration to be a midwinter theme with a king who sacrificed himself for his people.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a {{character}} being confronted at <b>a</b> <b>triumphant</b> feast with a reminder of their downfall {{is not unique to}} Shakespeare and may originate from the Belshazzar's feast episode of the Bible. The term 'ghost at the feast' has entered popular culture, and is often used as a metaphor for a subject a person would rather avoid considering, or (considering the general plot of Macbeth) a reminder of a person's unpleasant past or likely future.|$|E
5|$|The peasants' leader Ivaylo, said to {{had been}} a swineherd by the {{contemporary}} Byzantine chroniclers, {{proved to be a}} successful general and charismatic leader. In the first months of the rebellion, he defeated the Mongols and the Tsar's armies, personally slaying Constantine Tikh in battle. Later, he made <b>a</b> <b>triumphant</b> entry in the capital Tarnovo, married Maria, the emperor's widow, and forced the nobility to recognize him as Emperor of Bulgaria.|$|E

5|$|Augustus' {{powers were}} now complete. In fact, he dated his 'reign' from the {{completion}} of the Second Settlement, July 1, 23 BC. Almost as importantly, the Principate now had constitutional stability. Later Roman Emperors were generally limited to the powers and titles originally granted to Augustus, though often newly appointed Emperors would decline {{one or more of the}} honorifics given to Augustus in order to display humility. Just as often, as their reign progressed, Emperors would appropriate all of the titles, regardless of whether they had been granted them by the Senate. Later Emperors took to wearing the civic crown, consular insignia, and the purple robes of <b>a</b> <b>Triumphant</b> general (toga picta), which became the imperial insignia well into the Byzantine era.|$|E
5|$|Its premiere at the Queen's Theatre on 24 February 1711, {{possibly}} under Handel's direction, was <b>a</b> <b>triumphant</b> success. A further 12 {{performances were}} immediately scheduled; {{at the end}} of the run, popular demand was such that two more were added. Notwithstanding this enthusiasm, the financial strains of such a grand production led to legal actions against Hill from unpaid craftsmen. Nine days after the premiere the Lord Chamberlain's Office revoked the impresario's licence. Under Hill's successors the opera was played at the theatre in most seasons until 1716–17, by which time it had totalled 47 performances, far more than any other opera at the Queen's.|$|E
5|$|Unsatisfied {{with the}} low pay, in Kremenchuk Adler led an {{unsuccessful}} actors' strike. A series of intrigues almost {{led to a}} breakup with Sonya, but ultimately led both back into Rosenberg's troupe and led to their marriage in Poltava. When this particular troupe broke up, the Adlers were among the few players to remain with Rosenberg {{to form a new}} one that included the actress who later became famous under the name of Keni Liptzin. In Chernigov, Adler turned down the opportunity to act in a Russian-language production of Boris Gudonov. Around this time Goldfaden appeared again and, after using an elaborate intrigue to demonstrate to the Adlers that Rosenberg had no loyalty to them, recruited them to his own troupe, which at the time appeared to be headed for <b>a</b> <b>triumphant</b> entry into Saint Petersburg.|$|E

5|$|After a long chase, the Flying Monkeys {{succeed in}} {{capturing}} their targets {{and bring them}} back to Evillene. Vengeful for Dorothy having killed her sister, she dismembers the Scarecrow, flattens the Tin Man, and tortures the Lion in hopes of making Dorothy give her the silver shoes. When she threatens to throw Toto into a fiery cauldron, Dorothy nearly gives in until the Scarecrow hints to her to activate a fire sprinkler switch, which she does. The sprinklers put out the fire but also melt Evillene. She is flushed down into her throne, the lid of which slams shut like a toilet. With Evillene finally gone, her spells lose their power: the Winkies are freed from their permanent costumes (revealing attractive humans underneath) and their sweatshop tools disappear. They rejoice in dance and praise Dorothy as their emancipator. The Flying Monkeys give her and her friends <b>a</b> <b>triumphant</b> ride back to the Emerald City.|$|E
5|$|Sibelius's {{national}} stature was recognised in 1897 when he {{was awarded}} a state pension to enable him {{to spend more time}} composing. In 1904 he and Aino settled in Ainola, a country residence he built on the shores of Lake Tuusula in Järvenpää, where they lived for the remainder of their lives. Although life at Ainola was not always calm and carefree—Sibelius was often in debt and prone to bouts of heavy drinking—he managed over the following 20 years to produce a large output of orchestral works, chamber music, piano pieces and songs, as well as lighter music. His popularity spread across Europe to the United States where, during <b>a</b> <b>triumphant</b> tour in 1914, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Yale University. At home his status was such that his 50th birthday celebrations in 1915 were a national event, the centrepiece of which was the Helsinki premiere of his Fifth Symphony.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} Sitric in the Irish Annals is in 917 {{when he and}} Ragnall, another grandson of Ímar, are described as leading their fleets to Ireland. Sitric sailed his fleet to Cenn Fuait in Leinster, and Ragnall sailed his fleet to Waterford. Niall Glúndub, overking of the Northern Uí Néill saw these Vikings as a threat, and he marched an army south to repel them. The Vikings fought against {{the men of the}} Uí Néill at Mag Femen in County Tipperary and claimed victory, though only through timely reinforcement by Ragnall and his army. This was followed by another at the Battle of Confey (also known as the Battle of Cenn Fuait), against Augaire mac Ailella, overking of Leinster, who died in the battle. Augaire's death marked the end of effective opposition to the Vikings' return to Ireland. Sitric led his men on <b>a</b> <b>triumphant</b> return to Dublin, where he established himself as king, while Ragnall returned to England and soon became King of Northumbria.|$|E

5|$|Ragnall {{is presumed}} to have left Dublin {{with the rest of}} the ruling Vikings in 902. It appears he settled in {{southern}} Scotland or the Isle of Man, and is described by some scholars as a King of Mann. He may or may not have ruled territory in western and northern Scotland including the Hebrides and Northern Isles, but contemporary sources are silent on this matter. The earliest mention of him in the Irish Annals is in 914 when he is described as defeating Bárid mac Oitir in a naval battle off the Isle of Man. Bárid may have been a son of Otir mac Iercne, the man who killed a son of Auisle in 883, or a son of Jarl Otir, who later accompanied Ragnall and fought alongside him in England. Ragnall is mentioned in the annals again in 917 when he and Sitric, another grandson of Ímar, are described as leading their fleets to Ireland. Sitric sailed his fleet to Cenn Fuait in Leinster, and Ragnall sailed his fleet to Waterford. Niall Glúndub, overking of the Northern Uí Néill saw these Vikings as a threat, and he marched an army south to repel them. The Vikings fought against the men of the Uí Néill at Mag Femen in County Tipperary and claimed victory, though only through timely reinforcement by Ragnall and his army.

5|$|Meanwhile, back on Cybertron, Bumblebee {{struggles to}} {{maintain}} control, particularly after Ratbat's plots to have Skywarp assassinate him during a memorial for the Lost Light (which was presumed destroyed during its launch). Prowl and Arcee foil the attempted murder thanks to Starscream, who sees no benefit to restarting the war, {{and begins to}} work with Bumblebee and Metalhawk {{to form a new}} united government for Cybertron. Though many Decepticons are provided with jobs and fall into line, Bombshell continues with mysterious experiments that result in Prowl, {{at the end of his}} tether and increasingly emotionally closed-off, executing him. Fortunately, Ironhide is able to prevent chaos by successfully petitioning to have the I/D chips installed in the Decepticons turned off, restoring a sense of equality. Ironhide then recruits the Dinobots to join him in venturing into the wilderness to searching for the missing Aerialbots, only to go missing themselves. It is while they are being searched for by the other Autobots, Decepticons and NAILs that something else is discovered instead: a Metrotitan has returned to Cybertron, and it dubs Starscream the destined leader of the Transformer race. Before Starscream can exploit this new standing to any great extent, Megatron makes a surprising return and is taken into custody, causing the Decepticons to riot in the streets. It turns out that Megatron has secretly been working with a small team of Decepticons within Iacon to perfect the combination process, and he creates a new, more-powerful Devastator out of the Constructicons and Prowl, who has been under the mind-control of the still-living Bombshell. Ironhide, the Dinobots and the Aerialbots—now Superion—make <b>a</b> <b>triumphant</b> return to take Devastator down, while Megatron himself is neutralized by a failsafe created by Wheeljack. In the chaos, however, Starscream kills Metalhawk and uses his death to secure his position as sole ruler of Iacon, casting the Autobots and Decepticons out into the wilderness.|$|E
