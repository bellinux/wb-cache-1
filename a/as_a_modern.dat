5|$|Although the {{invasion}} of Khafji was initially a propaganda victory for the Ba'athist Iraqi government, it was swiftly recaptured by Saudi ground forces. The battle serves <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> demonstration that air power in a supporting role to ground forces can be of great assistance in halting and defeating a major ground operation.|$|E
5|$|As Norway gained full {{independence}} in 1905, {{the national government}} determined to establish institutions consistent with the newly formed state's ambitions <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> society. The first prime minister made it a priority to modernize the Royal Palace in Oslo, building among other things, some of the country's first water toilets, providing hot and cold water, and granting the Royal Family's wish of providing a common apartment for the king, queen, and their son.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, traffic {{congestion}} had reached such a level that the use of the square <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> wholesale distribution market was becoming untenable, and significant redevelopment was planned. Following a public outcry, buildings around the square were protected in 1973, preventing redevelopment. The following year the market moved to a new site in south-west London. The square languished until its central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980.|$|E

5|$|Francis Ricardo Buhay III {{served as}} the cinematographer, who had also worked on Matti's films Tiktik and Rigodon (2013). Rather than setting up and {{changing}} lights for certain shots, Buhay captured the film using the Red EPIC camera; with the Red EPIC's available lighting function, including the ability to light an entire set, the film was styled <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> noir without appearing low-budget.|$|E

5|$|The Hustler {{was a major}} {{critical}} and popular success, gaining a reputation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> classic.

5|$|As in {{plot and}} setting, Tolkien brings his {{literary}} theories {{to bear in}} forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is {{the form of the}} riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading {{to an understanding of the}} deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in The Hobbit.|$|E

He has always been a specialist in set pieces and takes a lot of corners and freekicks. His role models on the football pitch is former left back Gareth Bale and David Alaba.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of Corythosaurus and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{suggest that it}} may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals. The sense of hearing in hadrosaurids, specifically such as Lophorhothon, also seems to have been greatly developed because of an elongated lagena. The presence of a thin stapes (an ear bone that is rod-like in reptiles), combined with a large eardrum implies the existence of a sensitive middle ear. It is possible that hadrosaurid ears are sensitive enough to detect as much sound <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> crocodilian.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the engagements between 29 January and 1 February, the Coalition did not launch its main {{offensive}} into Kuwait and Iraq until the night of 24–25 February. The invasion of Iraq was completed about 48 hours later. The Battle of Khafji served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> example of the ability of air power to serve a supporting role to ground forces. It offered the Coalition an indication of the manner in which Operation Desert Storm would be fought, but also hinted at future friendly-fire casualties which accounted for nearly half of the American dead.|$|E

5|$|During {{the last}} ten years the city has {{experienced}} an economic, cultural and urban boom. The large growth in population has significantly increased the need for new accommodation, and new districts of the city were established at a quick pace. This strained Jordan's scarce water supply and exposed Amman to the dangers of quick expansion without careful municipal planning. Today, Amman is known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern,</b> liberal and westernized Arab city, with major mega projects such as the Abdali Urban Regeneration Project and the Jordan Gate Towers. The city contains several high-end hotel franchises including the Four Seasons Hotel Amman, Sheraton Hotel Amman, Fairmont Amman, St. Regis Hotel Amman, Le Royal Hotel and others.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August 1978, Kenyatta {{died in the}} State House, Mombasa. As {{a result}} of the UK's longstanding {{experience}} in state funerals, the Kenyan government requested British assistance in organising Kenyatta's. McKenzie was employed as a go-between, and the structure of the funeral was orchestrated to deliberately imitate that of deceased British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In doing so, senior Kenyans sought to project an image of their country <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> nation-state rather than one incumbent on tradition. The funeral took place at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, six days after Kenyatta's death. Britain's first heir to the throne, Charles, Prince of Wales, attended the event, a symbol of the value that the British government perceived in its relationship with Kenya.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, {{the film}} {{significantly}} under-performed {{at the box}} office, making $31.3 million worldwide against a budget of $70–80 million, which was blamed on an unusually poor marketing campaign. However, the film received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for several awards, winning nine Annie Awards out of 15 nominations. Through home video releases and television syndication, the film gathered a cult following and is now widely regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> animated classic. In 2015, an extended, remastered version of the film was re-released theatrically, which saw a home video release the following year.|$|E

5|$|Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine (Wadzek's Struggle {{with the}} Steam Turbine) is a 1918 comic novel by the German author Alfred Döblin. Set in Berlin, it narrates the futile and often {{delusional}} {{struggle of the}} eponymous industrialist Wadzek against Rommel, his more powerful competitor. In its narrative technique and its refusal to psychologize its characters, {{as well as in}} its vivid evocations of Berlin <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> metropolis, Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine has been read as a precursor to Döblin's better-known 1929 novel Berlin Alexanderplatz.|$|E

The listening musician, whatever his generation or his style, recognizes Bix <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern,</b> modernism being not a style but an attitude.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 2009, the Edinburgh, Scotland-based {{prediction}} market game Hubdub {{launched a}} spin-off known as FanDuel; the service attempted to market itself <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> {{alternative to the}} fantasy sports services provided by other media properties, such as Yahoo! Sports and CBSSports.com, with the daily fantasy format and integration with popular social networks. Its founder, Nigel Eccles, was inspired to create the site when he realizied that the carve-out for fantasy sports in the U.S. Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 did not state that a legal, paid fantasy sports competition had to last for an entire season. In February 2012, the Boston-based DraftKings was established by former VistaPrint executives Jason Robins, Matthew Kalish, and Paul Liberman. DraftKings gained a local, Somerville-based competitor in StarStreet, when it introduced a daily fantasy game of its own.|$|E
