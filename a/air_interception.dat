5|$|As {{microwave}} systems entered service, {{along with}} updated versions of aircraft carrying them, the problem arose {{of what to}} do with those aircraft carrying Mk. IV that were otherwise serviceable. One possibility, suggested as early as 1942, was homing in on the Luftwaffe's own radar sets. The basic operational frequencies of the Luftwaffes counterpart to the Mk. IV, the FuG 202 Lichtenstein BC radar, had been discovered in December 1942. On 3 April 1943 the <b>Air</b> <b>Interception</b> Committee ordered the TRE to begin considering the homing concept under the codename Serrate. As luck would have it, this proved to be perfect timing. In the late afternoon of 9 May 1943, a crew from IV/NJG.3 defected to the UK by flying their fully equipped Ju 88R-1 night fighter, D5+EV, to RAF Dyce in Scotland, giving the TRE their first direct look at the Lichtenstein.|$|E
500|$|Early {{development}} {{was prompted by}} a 1936 memo of Henry Tizard {{on the topic of}} night fighting. The memo was sent to Robert Watt, director of the radar research efforts, who agreed to allow physicist Edward George [...] "Taffy" [...] Bowen to form a team to study the problem of <b>air</b> <b>interception.</b> The team had a test bed system in flights later that year, but progress was delayed for four years by emergency relocations, three abandoned production designs, and Bowen's increasingly adversarial relationship with Watt's replacement, Albert Percival Rowe. Ultimately, Bowen was forced from the team just as the system was finally maturing.|$|E

2500|$|At November 1942 {{meeting of}} the <b>Air</b> <b>Interception</b> Committee, the future of AI radar was {{discussed}} {{with an eye to}} producing a plan for the long-term evolution of the systems. Among many ideas considered, the team chose a number of features they wished to see. Primary was the idea of an all-round view more like the ground-controlled intercept radars, which would allow the fighters to plan their own interceptions with less ground control required. Range was to be extended to at least , with a reduced minimum range of [...] The short minimum range was selected, along with demands for ½degree accuracy dead-ahead, to allow blind firing without visual contact. Other features like lock-follow and accurate range finding were also considered.|$|E

The Allied air forces developed a counter-air operation over a two-month period and implemented Operation Flax on 5 April 1943, destroying 11 Ju 52s in the air near Cap Bon and many more during bombing attacks on its Sicilian airfields, leaving only 29 flyable.

5000|$|The Uragan-1 was {{the first}} {{generation}} of a Soviet automatic <b>air</b> defense <b>interception</b> system, and was a component of the Soviet Air Defence Forces protivovozdushnaya oborona strany (PVO Strany). The concept began with a Soviet Council of Ministers resolution dated February 26, 1955 and the Ministry of Aviation Industry order dated March 8, 1955. The resolutions were in response to the threat from long-range supersonic bombers such as the United States' Convair B-58 [...] "Hustler" [...] and the equally threatening British Vickers Valiant, among others.
