5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture,</b> indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E

25|$|A {{chair is}} <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> with a raised surface {{supported}} by legs, {{commonly used to}} seat a single person. Chairs are supported most often by four legs and have a back; however, a chair can have three legs or can have a different shape. Chairs are made {{of a wide variety}} of materials, ranging from wood to metal to synthetic material (e.g. plastic), and they may be padded or upholstered in various colors and fabrics, either just on the seat (as with some dining room chairs) or on the entire chair. Chairs are used in a number of rooms in homes (e.g. in living rooms, dining rooms, and dens), in schools and offices (with desks), and in various other workplaces.|$|E
500|$|The NES {{version was}} {{included}} as <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> in Animal Crossing for the GameCube, {{along with many}} other NES games, though this one required the use of a Nintendo e-Reader, a Game Boy Advance accessory, and a North America-exclusive Animal Crossing e-Card. This version was later re-released in the second series of NES e-Cards, and was even re-released through the Famicom Mini series in Japan. An improved port called [...] was released in Japan for the Family Computer Disk System, with added features and revisions to gameplay. It also featured cutscenes and even advertisements, being sponsored by the food company Nagatanien. Kaette Kita is very rare since it was only available as a Disk Writer promotion. A later NES port was released exclusively in Europe in 1993, called Mario Bros. (Classic Series); this version had a more refined control and stage intermissions closer to the original arcade version.|$|E
500|$|Since {{infrasonic}} bass is felt, sub-bass can be augmented using tactile transducers. Unlike {{a typical}} subwoofer driver, which produces audible vibrations, tactile transducers produce low-frequency vibrations {{that are designed}} to be felt by individuals who are touching the transducer or indirectly through <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> or a wooden floor. Tactile transducers have recently emerged as a device class, called variously [...] "bass shakers", [...] "butt shakers" [...] and [...] "throne shakers". They are attached to a seat, for instance a drummer's stool ("throne") or gamer's chair, car seat or home theater seating, and the vibrations of the driver are transmitted to the body then to the ear {{in a manner similar to}} bone conduction. They connect to an amplifier like a normal subwoofer. They can be attached to a large flat surface (for instance a floor or platform) to create a large low frequency conduction area, although the transmission of low frequencies through the feet is not as efficient as the seat.|$|E

500|$|In his autobiography, Robinson {{states that}} by 1965 he was broke, having {{spent all of}} the $4 million in {{earnings}} he made inside {{and out of the}} ring during his career. A month after his last fight, Robinson was honored with a Sugar Ray Robinson Night on December 10, 1965, in New York's Madison Square Garden. During the ceremony, he was honored with a massive trophy. However, there was not <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> in his small Manhattan apartment with legs strong enough to support it. Robinson was elected to the Ring Magazine boxing Hall of Fame in 1967, two years after he retired and the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990. In the late 1960s he acted in some television shows, like [...] An episode of Land of the Giants called [...] "Giants and All That Jazz" [...] had Sugar as a washed up boxer opening a nightclub. [...] He also appeared in a few films including the Frank Sinatra cop movie The Detective (1968), the cult classic Candy (1968), and the thriller The Todd Killings (1971) as a police officer. In 1969, he founded the Sugar Ray Robinson Youth Foundation for the inner-city Los Angeles area. The foundation does not sponsor a boxing program. He was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus that was treated with insulin. In Robinson's last years, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. He died in Los Angeles at the age of 67 and was interred in the Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood, California.|$|E
500|$|The Elegance of the Hedgehog {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. In {{the earliest known}} review, for the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Maurizio Bono writes that [...] "he formula that made {{more than half a}} million readers in France fall in love with [...] has, among other ingredients: intelligent humor, fine sentiments, an excellent literary and philosophical backdrop, taste that is sophisticated but substantial". French magazine Elle reviewer Natalie Aspesi pronounced it one of [...] "the most exhilarating and extraordinary novels in recent years". Aspesi, however, tagged the novel's title as [...] "most curious and least appealing". Praising the novel in his review for The Guardian, Ian Samson wrote that [...] "The Elegance of the Hedgehog aspires to be great and pretends to philosophy: it is, at least, charming." [...] In an earlier review in the same paper, Groskop opined that the novel is a [...] "profound but accessible book... which elegantly treads the line between literary and commercial fiction". She added that [...] "clever, informative and moving, it is essentially a crash course in philosophy interwoven with a platonic love story". A review in The Telegraph conjectured that [...] "f [...] <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture,</b> it would be an Ikea bestseller: popular, but not likely to be passed down the generations". A review in The Times Literary Supplement went further, calling the book [...] "pretentious and cynical, with barely any story. It reads more like a tract than a novel, but lacks even a tract’s certainty of purpose. The characters are problematic: most are puppets, and those that aren’t are stereotypes".|$|E

2500|$|The case {{also gives}} the {{harpsichord}} its external appearance and protects the instrument. [...] A large harpsichord is, in a sense, <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture,</b> {{as it stands}} alone on legs and may be styled {{in the manner of}} other furniture of its place and period. [...] Early Italian instruments, on the other hand, were so light in construction that they were treated rather like a violin: kept for storage in a protective outer case, and played after taking it out of its case and placing it on a table. [...] Such tables were often quite high – until the late 18th century people usually played standing up. [...] Eventually, harpsichords came to be built with just a single case, though an intermediate stage also existed: [...] the false inner–outer, which for purely aesthetic reasons was built to look as if the outer case contained an inner one, in the old style. [...] Even after harpsichords became self-encased objects, they often were supported by separate stands, and some modern harpsichords have separate legs for improved portability.|$|E

2500|$|Critical {{reaction}} was mixed. Some accused {{the music of}} being [...] "sickly and practically lifeless" [...] and of sounding [...] "like the noise of a squeaky door or <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> being moved about, or a child crying in the distance." [...] Camille Saint-Saëns, a relentless opponent of Debussy's music, claimed he had abandoned his customary summer holidays so he could stay in Paris and [...] "say nasty things about Pelléas." [...] But others — especially the younger generation of composers, students and aesthetes — were highly enthusiastic. Debussy's friend Paul Dukas lauded the opera, Romain Rolland described it as [...] "one of {{the three or four}} outstanding achievements in French musical history", and Vincent d'Indy wrote an extensive review which compared the work to Wagner and early-17th-century Italian opera. D'Indy found Pelléas moving, too: [...] "The composer has in fact simply felt and expressed the human feelings and human sufferings in human terms, despite the outward appearance the characters present of living in a dream." [...] The opera won a [...] "cult following" [...] among young aesthetes, and the writer Jean Lorrain satirised the [...] "Pelléastres" [...] who aped the costumes and hairstyles of Mary Garden {{and the rest of the}} cast.|$|E

This advice also encourages people not to run out of a shaking building, because a large majority of earthquake injuries are due to broken bones from people falling and tripping during shaking.
