40|$|Addition of 0. 5 % onion was {{effective}} in reducing lipid oxidation in irradiated cooked ground beef after 7 d storage. Addition of garlic or onion greatly increased the amounts of sulfur volatiles from cooked ground beef.

Although, addition of garlic and onion produced large amounts of sulfur compounds, the intensity of irradiation odor and irradiation flavor in irradiated cooked ground beef {{was similar to that}} of the nonirradiated control. Addition of garlic (0. 1 %) or onion (0. 5 %) to ground beef produced garlic/onion aroma and flavor after cooking, and the intensity was stronger with 0. 1 % garlic than 0. 5 % onion treatment.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the effects of <b>adding</b> natural antioxidant (<b>garlic,</b> fresh or powdered) or a synthetic antioxidant (butylated hydroxytoluene/ BHT) on the quality of duck sausage during 21 d of refrigerated storage. Proximate composition, pH, thiobarbituric acid (TBA), Aerobic plate counts (APC), and mold count were measured. Generally, all sample types showed decreased moisture content and pH and increased protein and fat contents over the course of the refrigerated storage period. While TBA values and APCs increased during the experimental period for all sample types, the increases were lower in the samples with <b>garlic</b> <b>added</b> due to the antioxidant effect of garlic. TBA values of duck sausage with fresh garlic or <b>garlic</b> powder <b>added</b> were higher than that of the control throughout the storage period. Fresh garlic and garlic powder were more effective in preventing microbial growth than without adding synthetic antioxidant but addition of BHT was slightly better. Overall, the addition of 50 g of fresh garlic per kg sausage was the best at reducing the TBA value among the six levels of garlic tested...|$|R
