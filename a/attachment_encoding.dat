40|$|Research {{in natural}} {{language}} processing (NLP) is aimed at making machines automatically understand natural language. Incorporating world knowledge semantics is becoming an increasingly crucial requirement for resolving deep, complex decisions in most NLP tasks today, e. g., question answering, syntactic parsing, coreference resolution, and relation extraction. Structured NLP corpora such as treebanks {{are too small to}} encode much of this knowledge, so instead, we turn to the vast Web, and access its information via a diverse collection of Web n-gram counts (of size 4 billion, and ~ 500 x larger than Wikipedia). Shallow cues from this large n-gram dataset, when harnessed in a structured learning setting, help reveal deep semantics. In this thesis, we address various important facets of the semantics problem - from indirect semantics for sentence-level syntactic ambiguities, and semantics as specific knowledge for discourse-level coreference ambiguities, to structured acquisition of semantic taxonomies from text, and fine-grained semantics such as intensity order. These facets represent structured NLP tasks which have a combinatorially large decision space. Hence, in general, we adopt a structured learning approach, incorporating surface Web-based semantic cues as intuitive features on the full space of decisions. The feature weights are then learned automatically based on a discriminative training approach. Empirically, for each facet, we see significant improvements over the corresponding state-of-the-art. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we show how Web-based features can be powerful cues to resolving complex syntactic ambiguities. We develop surface n-gram features over the full range of syntactic <b>attachments,</b> <b>encoding</b> both lexical affinities as well as paraphrase-based cues to syntactic structure. These features, when encoded into full-scale, discriminative dependency and constituent parsers, correct a range of error types. In the next part, we address semantic ambiguities in discourse-level coreference resolution, again using Web n-gram features that capture a range of world knowledge cues to hypernymy, semantic compatibility, and semantic context, as well as general lexical co-occurrence. When added to a state-of-the-art coreference baseline, these Web features provide significant improvements on multiple datasets and metrics. In the third part, we acquire the semantics itself via structured learning of hypernymy taxonomies. We adopt a probabilistic graphical model formulation which incorporates heterogeneous relational evidence about both hypernymy and siblinghood, captured by surface features based on patterns and statistics from Web n-grams and Wikipedia abstracts. Inference is based on loopy belief propagation and spanning tree algorithms. The system is discriminatively trained on WordNet sub-structures using adaptive subgradient stochastic optimization. On the task of reproducing subhierarchies of WordNet, this approach achieves substantial error reductions over previous work. Finally, we discuss a fine-grained semantic facet - intensity order, where the relative ranks of near-synonyms such as good, great, and excellent are predicted using Web statistics of phrases like good but not excellent. We employ linear programming to jointly infer the positions on a single scale, such that individual decisions benefit from global information. When ranking English near-synonymous adjectives, this global approach gets substantial improvements over previous work on both pairwise and rank correlation metrics...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This paper {{outlines}} {{a hypothesis}} linking {{the development of}} implicit memory in infants and chronic suicidal thoughts in adults. In order to do this, the developmental trajectory of memory is reviewed, {{as well as how}} <b>attachment</b> experiences are <b>encoded</b> in implicit memory. The cognitive/emotional capacity of infants is then compared to the subjective experience of the chronically suicidal patient. This is used to develop the hypothesis that chronic suicidal thoughts are located in implicit memory, encoded very early in life. This idea is then used to explain why common responses by mental health workers to the chronically suicidal patient may inadvertently reinforce suicidal thoughts. Finally, understanding these concepts helps us to understand how psychotherapy can change chronic suicidal ideation. Conclusion: A hypothesis is proposed to link infant memory systems with adult chronic suicidal thoughts, and is used to understand helpful responses for patients who suffer with chronic suicidal ideation...|$|R

40|$|Tylosin is {{produced}} by Streptomyces fradiae via a combination of polyketide metabolism and synthesis of three deoxyhexose sugars, of which mycaminose {{is the first to}} be added to the polyketide aglycone, tylactone (protylonolide). Previously, disruption of the gene (tylMII) <b>encoding</b> <b>attachment</b> of mycaminose to the aglycone unexpectedly abolished accumulation of the latter, raising the possibility of a link between polyketide metabolism and deoxyhexose biosynthesis in S. fradiae. However, at that time, it was not possible to eliminate an alternative explanation, namely, that downstream effects on the expression of other genes, not involved in mycaminose metabolism, might have contributed to this phenomenon. Here, it is shown that disruption of any of the four genes (tylMI–III and tylB) specifically involved in mycaminose biosynthesis elicits a similar response, confirming that production of mycaminosyl-tylactone directly influences polyketide metabolism in S. fradiae. Under similar conditions, when mycaminose biosynthesis was specifically blocked by gene disruption, accumulation of tylactone could be restored by exogenous addition of glycosylated tylosin precursors. Moreover, certain other macrolides, not of the tylosin pathway, were also found to elicit qualitatively similar effects. Comparison of the structures of stimulatory macrolides will facilitate studies of the stimulatory mechanism...|$|R

The assay targets the chromosomally <b>encoded</b> <b>attachment</b> and invasion gene, ail. Three primer-probe sets (TM 1, TM 2, and TM 3) amplifying different, yet overlapping, regions of ail were examined for their specificity and sensitivity. All three primer-probe sets were able to detect between 0. 25 and 0. 5 pg of purified Y. enterocolitica DNA. TM 1 identified all 26 Y. enterocolitica strains examined. TM 3 was able to detect all strains except one, whereas TM 2 was unable to detect 10 of the Y. enterocolitica strains tested. None of the primer-probe sets cross-reacted with any of the 21 non-Y. enterocolitica strains examined. When the TM 1 set was utilized, the fluorogenic PCR assay was able to detect ≤ 4 Y. enterocolitica CFU/ml in pure culture and 10 Y. enterocolitica CFU/ml independent of the presence of 108 CFU of contaminating bacteria per ml.

Some viruses are restricted to mucosal surfaces, whereas others disseminate to sites of secondary replication. Studies of strain-specific differences in reovirus mucosal infection and sys-temic dissemination have enhanced an understanding of viral determinants andmolecular mechanisms that regulate viral pathogenesis. After peroral inoculation, reovirus strain type 1 Lang replicates to high titers in the intestine and spreads systemi-cally, whereas strain type 3 Dearing (T 3 D) does not.

40|$|Temporal {{transcription}} of phage wadh was analysed during lytic reproduction. Based on Northern hybridizations the phage genome {{was divided}} into regions of early, middle and late transcription. Eight groups of overlapping transcripts, probably originating from common precursors, were distinguished. Early transcription of a 10 ? 9 kb region adjacent to the lytic/ lysogenic switch started within the first 10 min of infection and produced three groups of mRNAs mostly related to DNA replication. Four middle transcripts were observed 30 min after infection, corresponding to an 8 ? 5 kb genomic region, which started at the replication origin (ori) and encompassed a DNA packaging function and the cos site. Three groups of late transcripts were first observed 50 min after infection, corresponding to a 21 ? 1 kb region between the middle region and the <b>attachment</b> site (attP), <b>encoding</b> functions for capsid morphogenesis and host cell lysis. A fourth group of late-appearing mRNAs was divergently transcribed from the 3 ? 2 kb section between attP and the lytic/lysogenic switch, including the repressor and integrase genes. Except for one set of early mRNAs, all the transcripts persisted {{until the end of}} the reproduction cycle. Two confirmed and two predicted promoters were assigned to transcript 59 ends in the early region...|$|R
40|$|Reovirus induces {{apoptosis}} in {{cultured cells}} and in vivo. Genetic {{studies indicate that}} the efficiency with which reovirus strains induce apoptosis {{is determined by the}} viral S 1 gene, which <b>encodes</b> <b>attachment</b> protein ς 1. However, the biochemical properties of ς 1 that influence apoptosis induction are unknown. To determine whether the capacity of ς 1 to bind cell surface sialic acid determines the magnitude of the apoptotic response, we used isogenic reovirus mutants that differ in the capacity to engage sialic acid. We found that T 3 SA+, a virus capable of binding sialic acid, induces high levels of apoptosis in both HeLa cells and L cells. In contrast, non-sialic-acid-binding strain T 3 SA− induces little or no apoptosis in these cell types. Differences in the capacity of T 3 SA− and T 3 SA+ to induce apoptosis are not due to differences in viral protein synthesis or production of viral progeny. Removal of cell surface sialic acid with neuraminidase abolishes the capacity of T 3 SA+ to induce apoptosis. Similarly, incubation of T 3 SA+ with sialyllactose, a trisaccharide comprised of lactose and sialic acid, blocks apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that reovirus binding to cell surface sialic acid is a critical requirement for the efficient induction of apoptosis and suggest that virus receptor utilization {{plays an important role in}} regulating cell death...|$|R
40|$|Apoptosis plays a {{major role}} in the {{cytopathic}} effect induced by reovirus following infection of cultured cells and newborn mice. Strain-specific differences in the capacity of reovirus to induce apoptosis segregate with the S 1 and M 2 gene segments, which <b>encode</b> <b>attachment</b> protein σ 1 and membrane penetration protein μ 1, respectively. Virus strains that bind to both junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) and sialic acid are the most potent inducers of apoptosis. In addition to receptor binding, events in reovirus replication that occur during or after viral disassembly but prior to initiation of viral RNA synthesis also are required for reovirus-induced apoptosis. To determine whether reovirus infection initiated in the absence of JAM-A and sialic acid results in apoptosis, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells engineered to express Fc receptors were infected with reovirus using antibodies directed against viral outer-capsid proteins. Fc-mediated infection of CHO cells induced apoptosis in a σ 1 -independent manner. Apoptosis following this uptake mechanism requires acid-dependent proteolytic disassembly, since treatment of cells with the weak base ammonium chloride diminished the apoptotic response. Analysis of T 1 L × T 3 D reassortant viruses revealed that the μ 1 -encoding M 2 gene segment is the only viral determinant of the apoptosis-inducing capacity of reovirus when infection is initiated via Fc receptors. Additionally, a temperature-sensitive, membrane penetration-defective M 2 mutant, tsA 279. 64, is an inefficient inducer of apoptosis. These data suggest that signaling pathways activated by binding of σ 1 to JAM-A and sialic acid are dispensable for reovirus-mediated apoptosis and that the μ 1 protein plays an essential role in stimulating proapoptotic signaling...|$|R
40|$|Serotype-specific {{patterns}} of reovirus {{disease in the}} CNS of newborn mice segregate with the viral S 1 gene segment, which <b>encodes</b> <b>attachment</b> protein σ 1 and nonstructural protein σ 1 s. The importance of receptor recognition in target cell selection by reovirus implicates the σ 1 protein as the primary effector of disease outcome. However, the contribution of σ 1 s to reovirus disease is unknown. To define the function of σ 1 s in reovirus pathogenesis, we generated a σ 1 s-deficient virus by altering a single nucleotide to disrupt the σ 1 s translational start site. Viruses were recovered that contain nine gene segments from strain type 3 Dearing and either the wild-type or σ 1 s-null S 1 gene segment from strain type 1 Lang. Following peroral inoculation of newborn mice, both viruses replicated in the intestine, although the wild-type virus achieved higher yields than the σ 1 s-null virus. However, unlike the wild-type virus, the σ 1 s-deficient virus failed to disseminate to sites of secondary viral replication, including the brain, heart, and liver. Within the small intestine, both viruses were detected in Peyer's patches, but only the wild-type virus reached the mesenteric lymph node. Concordantly, wild-type virus, but not σ 1 s-deficient virus, was detected {{in the blood of}} infected animals. Wild-type and σ 1 s-null viruses produced equivalent titers following intracranial inoculation, indicating that σ 1 s is dispensable for viral growth in the murine CNS. These results suggest a key role for σ 1 s in virus spread from intestinal lymphatics to the bloodstream, thereby allowing the establishment of viremia and dissemination to sites of secondary replication within the infected host...|$|R
