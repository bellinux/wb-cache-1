40|$|The {{products}} on the interface of a molybdenum electrode and glass melt were investigated primarily at 1400 °C in three model glass melts without ingredients, with 1 % Sb 2 O 3 and with 1 % Sb 2 O 3 and 0. 5 % SO 3 (wt. %), both under and without load by alternating current. Corrosion of the molybdenum electrode in glass melt without AC load is higher by one order of magnitude if <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides</b> are present. The corrosion continues to increase if sulfate is present in addition to <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides.</b> Isolated <b>antimony</b> droplets largely occur on the electrode-glass melt interface, and numerous droplets are also dissipated in the surrounding glass if only <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides</b> {{are present in the}} glass melt. A comparatively continuous layer of antimony occurs on the interface if SO 3 is also present, antimony being always in contact with molybdenum sulfide. Almost no antimony droplets are dissipated in the glass melt. The total amount of precipitated antimony also increases. The presence of sulfide on the interface likely facilitates antimony precipitation. The reaction of molybdenum with <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides</b> is inhibited in sites covered by an antimony layer. The composition of sulfide layers formed at 1400 °C approximates that of Mo 2 S 3. At 1100 °C, the sulfide composition approximates that of MoS 4. Corrosion multiplies in the glass melt without additions through the effect of AC current, most molybdenum being separated in the form of metallic particles. Corrosion also increases in the glass melt containing <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides.</b> This is due to increased corrosion in the neighborhood of the separated antimony droplets. This mechanism also results in the loosening of molybdenum particles. The amount of precipitated antimony also increases through the effect of the AC current. AC exerts no appreciable effect on either corrosion, the character of the electrode-glass interface, or antimony precipitation in the glass melt containing SO 3...|$|R

Above 400 degreesC, mixed phase material was produced, with isolated crystallites of pure antimony becoming the dominant phase as the temperature was increased.

40|$|Atomic {{clusters}} {{are attractive}} candidates for building motifs for new nano-assembled materials with desirable properties. At this nano-regime of matter, the size, shape, {{and composition of}} clusters changes their electronic structure and hence their properties. Computational modeling must work {{hand in hand with}} experiment to provide robust descriptions of the geometries and energetics of atomic clusters and how they might behave in a nano-assembled material. To this end, we have investigated three distinct species as model systems: <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides</b> SbxOy (x = 1, 2; y = 0 - 3), metal ion-solvent complexes Mm(NH 3) n (M = Bi, Pb; m = 1 - 2, n = 0 - 4), and quantum dots Z 10 H 16 (Z = Si, Ge) and β-Sn 12 H 24. Their geometries and electronic structures have been determined using gradient-corrected density functional theory. The relative stabilities for <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides</b> have been examined by the respective comparison of highest-occupied and lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gaps and atomization energies. The superior electronic stability of Sb 2 O 3 is indicated by its closed shell structure, wide HOMO-LUMO gap calculated to be 3. 11 eV, and high atomization energy of 4. 21 eV. Spin-orbit corrections were necessary for accurate calculation of the metal-solvent energetics, closing the gap between experimental and theoretical values by 1. 05 eV for the electron affinity of the Pb atom. Quantum dot modeling of the well-established Si and Ge as well as the less-investigated Sn illuminated the accuracy of the CEP basis sets and the B 3 LYP functional over other DFT computational routes for clusters containing elements beyond the third row. Throughout, the results correlate well with experiment and higher order ab initio methods where data is available. These comparisons validate the accuracy of the computational routes used.

50|$|An oxide {{thin-film}} transistor (TFT) {{is a particular}} kind of field-effect transistor made by depositing thin films of a semiconductor active layer as well as the dielectric layer and metallic contacts over a supporting substrate. The principal difference between amorphous silicon TFT and Oxide TFT is that the material of the electron channel is oxide or amorphous silicon. A common substrate is glass, since the primary application of TFTs is in liquid crystal displays and organic light emitting displays (OLEDs). This differs from the conventional transistor where the semiconductor material typically is the substrate, such as a silicon wafer. TFT electrical performance is dramatically degraded if a zinc-tin-oxide TFT is covered with a dielectric layer and does not undergo both types of annealing. In addition to silicon dioxide, successful passivation of zinc-tin-oxide TFTs is accomplished using thermally evaporated calcium fluoride, germanium oxide, strontium fluoride, or <b>antimony</b> <b>oxide</b> as passivation.|$|E

The results show that all the Antandros glasses were produced by using coastal sand as Levantine I glasses and exhibit similar compositions with natron type glasses (Roman type glasses), except for lower natron levels. Lower natron levels indicate that Antandros mosaic glass may have been produced in 7 th century AD or natron may have been provided from a new flux source due to the shortage of Egyptian mineral soda or due to economic reasons glass manufacturers succeeded to produce same glass with low flux addition.

30|$|Thus, the {{preferred}} (200) orientation was observed for Sb-doped films at 2 to 7 at.%. The preferred (200) orientation was also reported by Elangovan et al.[6]. This behavior with Sb doping implies {{that in the}} present case, antimony incorporation in SnO 2 lattice has not affected the structural properties to a considerable extent. On the other hand, for higher dopant levels, the incorporation would take place at interstitial sites, and some precipitation like <b>antimony</b> <b>oxides</b> (Sb 2 O 3, Sb 2 O 4, and Sb 2 O 5) could be induced[9]. As a result, {{with the increase of}} doping concentration, the deposited films lose the crystallinity, and {{the preferred}} orientation growth of SnO 2 films may be suppressed by the precipitation. In the present case, antimony incorporation in SnO 2 lattice has not affected the structural properties to a considerable extent. It is also clear that in Figure 1, the crystallinity improves initially with antimony doping up to 7 at.% in the present case, but it decreases progressively beyond 7 at.% doping concentration, as observed by Shanthi et al.[10].|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{treating}} concentrates with increasingly {{higher levels of}} arsenic and antimony {{is compounded by the}} trertd to stricter environmental guidelines regarding the disposal of smelter wastes. Much of the arsenic and antimony from non-ferrous processes is recovered as oxide fume.
