Aero-X Golf, Inc is the {{manufacturer}} that created the Polara Ultimate Straight and Polara Ultimate Straight XS golf balls featuring “Self-Correcting Technology” that reduces hooks and slices by up to 75%. David L. Felker, PhD, Chairman of the Board, CEO, Head of Technology of Aero-X Golf, Inc. and former Callaway Golf Company founding member and Vice President of Research and Development, coinvented the Polara Ultimate Straight golf balls, along with Douglas C. Winfield PhD, formerly of Maxfli and Titleist. The new Polara Ultimate Straight golf balls represent a large performance improvement over the original Polara golf ball which was first sold in 1977. The new design, released August 2010, utilizes state-of-the-art aerodynamics and a principal <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia.</b> The ball has shallow truncated dimples around its equator and has deep spherical and small spherical dimples {{on each of the}} ball's poles.|$|E

In torque-free precession, the angular momentum is a constant, but the angular velocity vector changes orientation with time.

The appendage is modeled as a geometrically exact rod which allows for finite bending, shearing and twist in three dimensions. Application of the energy-momentum method to this example depends crucially on a special choice of variables in terms of which the second variation block diagonalizes into blocks associated with rigid body modes and internal vibration modes respectively. The analysis yields a nonlinear stability result which states that relative equilibria are nonlinearly stable provided that; (i) the angular velocity is bounded above by the square root of the minimum eigenvalue of an associated linear operator and, (ii) the whole assemblage is rotating about the minimum <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia...</b>|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{yawing moment}} of inertia has been {{obtained}} by measuring the acceleration in yaw resulting from {{the release of a}} wing-tip parachute. Lateral accelerometers mounted near the fore and aft extremities of the aircraft on a line parallel to the principal <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> were used to measure the yawing acceleration. The principal axis is known in this case from previous ground measurements, but it is shown that 1 degree error in axis inclination would only produce an error of about 3 per cent in the measured inertia.

40|$|Optical {{observations}} of rotating space debris near GEO contain important information on size, shape, composition, and rotational states, but these aspects {{are difficult to}} extract due to data limitations and {{the high number of}} degrees of freedom in the modeling process. For tri-axial rigid debris objects created by satellite fragmentations, the most likely initial rotation state has a large component of initial angular velocity directed along the intermediate <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia,</b> leading to large angular reorientations of the body on the timescale of the rotation period. This lends some support to the simplest possible interpretation of light curves [...] that they represent sets of random orientations of the objects of study. However, effects of internal friction and solar radiation are likely to cause significant modification of rotation states within a time as short as a few orbital periods. In order to examine the rotational dynamics of debris objects under the influences of these effects, a set of seven first-order coupled equations of motion were assembled in state form: three are Euler equations describing the rates of change of the components of angular velocity in the body frame, and four describe the rates of change of the components of the unit quaternion. Quaternions are a four-dimensional extension of complex numbers that form a seamless, singularity-free representation of body orientation on S 3. The Euler equations contain explicit terms describing torque from solar radiation in terms of spherical harmonics, and terms representing effects of a prescribed rate of internal friction. Numerical integrations of these equations of motion are being performed, and results will be presented. Initial tests show that internal friction without solar radiation torque leads to rotation about the maximum principal <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia,</b> as required, and solar radiation torque is expected to lead to spin-up of objects. Because the axis of maximum rotational inertia tends to be roughly coincident with the normal to the largest projected cross-sectional area, internal friction is expected to lead to reduced variation of light curve amplitudes at a given phase angle, but a large dependence of the same on phase angle. At a given phase angle, databases are generated which contain reflected intensities for comprehensive sets of equally-likely orientations, represented as unit quaternions. When projected onto three dimensions (S 2) and color-coded by intensity, the set is depicted as points within a solid, semi-transparent unit sphere, within which all possible reflected intensities for an object at a given phase angle may be inspected simultaneously. Rotational sequences are represented by trajectories through the sphere. Databases are generated for each of a set of phase angles separately, forming a comprehensive dataset of reflected intensities spanning all object orientations and solar phase angles. Symmetries in the problem suggest that preferred rotation states are likely, defined relative to the object-sun direction in inertial space and relative to the maximum principal <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> in the body coordinate system. Such rotation states may greatly simplify the problem of light curve interpretation by reducing the number of degrees of freedom in the problem...|$|E
