[...] The low, sharp temperature inversion can lead to areas of persistent stratocumulus or stratus cloud, known in colloquial terms as <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>gloom.</b> The type of weather brought about by an anticyclone depends on its origin. For example, extensions of the Azores high bubble pressure may bring about <b>anticyclonic</b> <b>gloom</b> during the winter, as they are warmed at the base and will trap moisture as they move over the warmer oceans. High pressures that build {{to the north and}} extend southwards will often bring clear weather. This is due to being cooled at the base (as opposed to warmed), which helps prevent clouds from forming.
