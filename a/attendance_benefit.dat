40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{problems}} {{of taking care}} about elderly people in domestic surroundings. The work gives an account of experience of people who look after an elderly person in domestic surroundings. The thesis consists of two parts. The first theoretical part is divided into five chapters. In Chapter One the concepts of old age and aging are explained. Next the needs of old age are discussed. Then changes brought about by aging are summarized. Chapter Two explains the importance and role of family in old people's lives. The concept of carer is specified, mainly who can become a carer and what conditions this person should meet. Next, principles of caring for elderly people at home and problems that might arise are discussed. In addition the care for the carer is discussed, what a caring person should do to make their situation easier. Chapter Three gives an overview of support equipment {{that can be used}} at home. Chapter Four deals with legal measures related to caring for an elderly relative at home and with the concept of attendance allowance - who is entitled to it, how the level of necessary support is assessed and how much the benefit is. Next equipment and mobility benefits are explained. Last chapter gives a summary of social services that carers can make use of. The other empirical part of this thesis focuses on practical experience of people who care for an elderly person at home. The main question was "What are the factors affecting the care for an elderly person at home?" This question consisted of four partial questions "What does caring for an elderly person include?" "What does a day of a caring person look like?" "What makes caring easier?" "What social services do the carer and the elderly person use?" I choose the method of qualitative research for collecting data. I asked questions and used the technique of semi structured interview. The research group represented four people caring for an elderly relative at home. Each carer had been looking after the elderly relative for at least six months, each elderly person was receiving second level <b>attendance</b> <b>benefit</b> and each carer was willing to cooperate. The information I obtained was processed by the cluster method and then evaluated on the basis of common elements and lastly divided according the four partial research questions. The research answered all the questions. The carers and elderly people were relatives. The carers provided all sort of activities basic health treatment, household chores, handling official issues. Next I focused on health care. It has turned out that all the elderly people except one have a general practitioner in the place where they live and see them according to their current state of health in the accompaniment of the carer. To see a specialist, they usually have to travel about 90 kilometres. The next research question referred to the daily routine of the carer. The research has shown that each day of a carer is the same and that all activities are tailored {{to the needs of the}} elderly person. The carers do not have any free time for themselves. As for support equipment for homecare. The next question was whether and if so what social services do the carers use. The research has shown that the carers do not use any social services even though they know this possibility exists. The carers knew about attendance allowance from social workers, general practitioners or colleagues. They use this allowance in different ways for buying medicine, support equipment. In two cases the carers put the allowance money aside. All the respondents know about the mobility allowance, only one of them knows about the allowance for special aids...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{prevalence}} and determinants of basic and/or <b>attendance</b> <b>benefits</b> among children {{involved with the}} child welfare system (CWS). Design: A register study of all children involved with CWS in Norway from 1997 - 2006. Participants: 96, 354 children from the CWS group and 149, 030 children who had never been in the CWS as a comparison group. Results: 11 % of children involved with CWS received basic and/or <b>attendance</b> <b>benefits</b> compared to 3 % in the comparison group. In multivariate logistic regression, the boys’ chances of ever receiving basic and/or <b>attendance</b> <b>benefits</b> were greater than the girls’ chances. The chances of receiving benefits increased nearly four to sixfold as a child becomes older. However, they decrease as the age at debut to CWS increases. It was also revealed that those children who stayed under child welfare for two or more years had an increased chance of ever receiving basic and/or <b>attendance</b> <b>benefits.</b> For children with reported behavioral disorders, the chances of basic and/or <b>attendance</b> <b>benefits</b> were nearly twofold. For children under home-based support and medication interventions, the chances of receiving basic and/or <b>attendance</b> <b>benefits</b> were greater than for children who were not under these interventions. Conclusion: Chronic health conditions that claim basic and/or <b>attendance</b> <b>benefits</b> were more prevalent among children involved with CWS than the general children’s population. This phenomenon may be explained by gender, age, age at debut to CWS, length of stay under CWS, types and reasons for intervention...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the effects of}} state laws banning access to in-state resident tuition (ISRT) rates and other educational benefits for unauthorized immigrant students (UIS) in five states: Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, and Ohio. It measures the overall effect of policies denying ISRT that were implemented between 2005 - 2012 in the United States. Three potential effects are evaluated. First, the study estimates the policy effects on the college enrollment of UIS. Because the policy does not deny {{access to higher education}} institutions, the possibility exists for this population to attend public or private colleges. However, facing higher costs (i. e., out-of-state tuition) can deter them from continuing their educational plans. Second, considering the potential dynamic effects of policies banning access to ISRT for UIS, the research evaluates the policy effects on school drop out rates among unauthorized immigrants. The lack of real opportunities to attend higher education might demotivate secondary UIS, thus prompting them to drop out of school. Finally, the research estimates the effects of banning ISRT access for UIS on the enrollment of citizens and legal residents in higher education. To answer the research questions a multivariate regression difference-in-differences identification strategy is advanced through the construction of a natural quasi-experiment using as the main data source the American Community Survey. The research finds significant negative policy effects on the college attendance rates of Hispanic foreign-born non-citizens who are highly likely to be unauthorized immigrants in policy states compared to their peers in non-policy states. The results also indicate that among the groups analyzed, policies have mainly affected recent high school graduates. With regard to dropping out of school, no-statistically significant evidence was found to support the hypothesis of dynamic effects of the policies on the enrollment of unauthorized immigrants in secondary education. This research finds no evidence of college <b>attendance</b> <b>benefits</b> for U. S. -born citizens associated with the ISRT policy, save for suggestive evidence for a subgroup of Black men. Suggestive evidence of moderate benefits among two subgroups of naturalized citizens is also found...|$|R
40|$|There are {{two main}} {{portions}} to this study. In the first portion (Chapters I-III) we identify policies, procedures, programs, and pedagogical practices in public school districts in Texas that increase levels of college preparation among black and Hispanic students {{across a range of}} educational settings (rural, suburban, and urban). We identify these practices by interviewing school administrators at twenty-two school districts throughout the state. The school districts were selected by using education production function models to identify the highest and lowest performing school districts on a variety of college preparation measures. The first portion of the study is largely descriptive and qualitative in orientation. In the second portion of the study we identify high college preparation levels among minority students as a positive externality. Because college <b>attendance</b> <b>benefits</b> students as individuals, regardless of the beneficial aspects of college attendance for society at large, students, parents, and others will request that school districts increase college preparation levels to some degree. However, given the nature of positive externalities, we explore the possibility that the reason why some school districts have higher college preparation levels among minority students than others is that they are led by an official policy-maker (the superintendent) who is committed to acting in the long-term interests of society (in other words, whose representational style is to act as a trustee). The second portion attempts to extend the causal chain back one link by exploring the possibility that superintendent representational style affects the types of policies, procedures, programs and pedagogical practices adopted and the district??s commitment to implementing them, which in turn affects college preparation levels among minority students. The relationship between superintendent representational style and minority student preparation for college is tested using two data sources: a survey of public school superintendents throughout Texas gathered by the Texas Educational Excellence Project and college preparation measures gathered by the Texas Education Agency for all public schools in Texas...|$|R

40|$|The study explores subgroups within host {{residents}} {{based on}} {{perceptions of the}} impacts of the 2012 Tour de Taiwan {{before and after the}} event. Theoretical perspectives of event impact studies considering Confucian traditions, social exchange theory and a sense of ‘feel-good’ or ‘communitas’ help to provide fresh insights. Data were collected from host residents in three competition stages, before and after the event. Twenty-two impact items divided into four factors generated subgroups of ‘neutral’ and ‘moderately positive’ (pre-event), and ‘neutral’ and ‘positive’ (post-event). The results show significant differences among the subgroups at the pre- and post-event stages in terms of gender, income, engagement in cycling exercises, levels of support and interest in the event, television watching, and event <b>attendance.</b> General <b>benefits,</b> negative impacts, the level of interest in the event and attendance were significant predictors of event support.

During our research we managed to establish cooperation with all parents of the pupils of the language course and also individualize their needs with regard to their cognitive abilities and home background. We have found that the parents are willing to cooperate if the teacher is able to create conditions for that not only at school but also whether he or she can choose appropriate strategies and forms of cooperation with regard to domestic conditions of the pupil.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{demonstrate}} an alternative procedure for reducing state expenditures in ongoing state programs without resulting in the major description commonly associated with uniform or across-the-board state budget cuts. Using, for purposes of illustration only, a problem involving the reduction in state expenditures for a school finance program, a linear programming model was derived [...] then applied. The purpose or objective of the model was to determine the required state resource allocation strategy which would minimize the state's financial commitment (however it may be defined by educators and legislators) without seriously affecting the financial support for educational expenditures at the school district level. In the state finance program studied, the total state expenditure could have been reduced by over one million dollars with no reduction in the state guaranteed minimum level of expenditure (referred to as the foundation level) per ADA (student in average daily <b>attendance).</b> Peripheral <b>benefits</b> such as a large amount of property tax relief, more state aid to districts with a poor tax base, and a decrease in the dollar spread in per pupil expenditures between districts were also achieved.

40|$|Objectives: Cardiac {{rehabilitation}} (CR) remains underused and inconsistently accessed, {{particularly for}} women and minorities. This study examined the factors associated with CR enrollment {{within the context of}} an automatic referral system through a retrospective chart review plus survey. Through the Behavioral Model of Health Services Utilization, it was postulated that enabling and perceived need factors, but not predisposing factors, would significantly predict patient enrollment. Subjects: A random sample of all atherosclerotic heart disease (AHD) patients treated at a tertiary care center (Trillium Health Centre, Ontario, Canada) from April 2001 to May 2002 (n = 501) were mailed a survey using a modified Dillman method (71 % response rate). Measures: Predisposing measures consisted of sociodemographics such as age, sex, ethnocultural background, work status, level of education, and income. Enabling factors consisted of barriers and facilitators to CR <b>attendance,</b> exercise <b>benefits</b> and barriers (EBBS), and social support (MOS). Perceived need factors consisted of illness perceptions (IPQ) and body mass index. Results: Of the 272 participants, 199 (73. 2 %) attended a CR assessment. Lower denial/minimization, fewer logistical barriers to CR (eg, distance, cost), and lower perceptions of AHD as cyclical or episodic reliably predicted CR enrollment among cardiac patients who were automatically referred. Conclusion: Because none of the predisposing factors were significant in the final model, this suggests that factors associated with CR enrollment within the context of an automatic referral model relate to enabling factors and perceived need. A prospective controlled evaluation of automatic referral is warranted. CIHR Institute of Gender and Healt...|$|R
40|$|Background: A better {{understanding}} of the factors that influence mammography screening attendance is needed to improve the effectiveness of these screening programs. The objective {{of the study was to}} examine whether psychosocial factors predicted attendance at a population-based invitational mammography screening program. Methods: Data on cohabitation, social network/support, sense of control, and stress were obtained from the Malmo Diet and Cancer Cohort Study and linked to the Malmo mammography register in Sweden. We analyzed 11, 409 women (age 44 to 72) who were free of breast cancer at study entry (1992 to 1996). Mammography attendance was followed from cohort entry to December 31, 2009. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to account for repeated measures within subjects. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) are reported. Results: Among 69, 746 screening opportunities there were 5, 552 (8 %) cases of non-attendance. Higher odds of non-attendance were found among women who lived alone (OR= 1. 47 (1. 33 - 1. 63)) or with children only (OR= 1. 52 (1. 29 - 1. 81)), had one childbirth (OR= 1. 12 (1. 01 - 1. 24)) or three or more childbirths (OR= 1. 34 (1. 21 - 1. 48)), had low social participation (OR= 1. 21 (1. 10 - 1. 31)), low sense of control (OR= 1. 12 (1. 02 - 1. 23)), and experienced greater stress (OR= 1. 24 (1. 13 - 1. 36)).

The reality is that many public school students are at-risk of school failure and eventually dropping out partially because of poor attendance behaviors. These poor attendance behaviors can usually be traced to challenged communities and families whose children face multiple at-risk factors. Urban inner-city schools with high percentages of minority students are among those with the highest risk factors and they experience the greatest problems with attendance and, eventually, truancy. The Richmond Public Schools (RPS) has worked diligently {{for many years to}} promote resiliency factors in the schools and school system as a whole to moderate the effects of these multiple risk factors. Strengths associated with the RPS attendance plan and procedures include a well-developed and periodically revised plan and procedures manual, adequate tracking and reporting practices defined for daily student attendance, dedicated staff supportive of appropriate attendance behaviors, and numerous support systems for student intervention in cases of inappropriate attendance behaviors...|$|R

This presentation will impact the forensic science community by underlining the importance of using morphometric analysis in age estimation while also taking into account the differences that exist between various ethnic groups Introduction: Determination of adult age by tooth analysis is an important issue in forensics and has significant implications in determining criminal liability. It also plays a critical role in issues regarding young illegal immigrants and refugee children. Moreover, the results of such analyses play a substantial role in areas related to school <b>attendance,</b> social <b>benefits,</b> adoption procedures, employment, and marriage as related to international protections guaranteed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The study was conducted on digital orthopantomographs (OPG) and was based on identification criteria using morphometric analysis with the goal of overcoming the limits associated with using morphological analysis alone. This investigation also served to verify the existence of differences in third molar development among Italian and Albanian populations. The goal of the study was to test the possibility of applying the results of a previous morphometric analysis conducted on an Italian sample population (Forensic Sci. 2008 Jul; 53 (4) : 904 - 9) to an Albanian sample population: Albanians are the second most populous ethnic group in Italy after Italians. Materials and Methods: OPGs were obtained by systematic digital analysis using specialized dental software. In the first phase of the study, the confidence intervals obtained from the Italian sample were applied to a sample of 140 Albanians whose OPG ages were between 16 and 19 years.

A questionnaire survey of older workers was conducted in order to elicit the salient attitudes to, experience of, and satisfaction with work of job changers and non-changers aged 50 years and over, employed within a nationwide retail organisation. Results were based on 228 questionnaires. Respondents ranged in age from 50 to 73 years, 54 % were female, 46 % male. Respondents demonstrated a significant increase in self-perception the perceived benefits of working far outweighed perceived difficulties. There were {{differences between men and women}} in the prompts to change employment and in salient attitudes to work. A questionnaire survey of women returners was conducted to explore items women considered when embarking on college courses, their experience of these same items while at college, and the relationship between the decision considerations and subjective well-being. The results of 336 questionnaires were analysed. Respondents ranged in age from 16 to 62 years. The expected benefits of attending college were given greater consideration than expected risks, confirming work by Janis and Mann (1977). Actual benefits and actual problems were overall the most useful predictors of college related well-being. There were differences between young and mature students, women with and without partners, and those with and without dependents in terms of items on the motivator for college <b>attendance,</b> expected <b>benefit</b> and risk and actual benefit and problem scales. The Warr Subjective Well Being (SWB) scale was shown to be a reliable measure of college related well-being.

Several studies associated church attendance with decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Research by Rita W. Law and David A. Sbarra demonstrated that [...] "church attendance {{was found to have}} a protective effect against the emergence of mood problems among older adults." [...] Graham et al. discovered that [...] "consistent pattern of lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures among frequent church attenders was found compared to that of infrequent attenders which was not due to the effects of age, obesity, cigarette smoking, or socioeconomic status." [...] Oman D et al. found that [...] "infrequent (never or less than weekly) attenders had significantly higher rates of circulatory, cancer, digestive, and respiratory mortality (p < 0.05), but not mortality due to external causes." [...] With respect to students, Glanville et al. found [...] "that religious attendance promotes higher intergenerational closure, friendship networks with higher educational resources and norms, and extracurricular participation." ...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that blue-green egg colours have evolved as a post-mating signal of female quality, selected by males allocating their parental effort {{in response to the}} strength of this signal. We tested two main assumptions of the sexually selected egg coloration hypothesis: (1) whether the intensity of eggshell blue-green chroma (BGC) reflects female quality; and (2) whether males make their decisions on the level of parental care that they provide according to the intensity of eggshell BGC. As a model species, we chose the facultatively polygynous great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus). In this species, females simultaneously paired with the same male, compete for his nest <b>attendance</b> and could <b>benefit</b> from signalling their quality through egg coloration. However, we found no association between the variation in eggshell BGC and the measures of female quality (physical condition, mean egg volume and age). Moreover, great reed warbler males did not adjust their investment (as measured in terms of nest defence against a brood parasite) in relation to the eggshell BGC. We conclude that blue-green egg coloration in this open-nesting passerine is unlikely to have a signalling function. Rather, the large colour variation among clutches of individual females may depend on yearly fluctuations in environmental conditions. © 2011 Springer-Verlag. Articl...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} {{childhood}} weight management programmes relies on family engagement. While <b>attendance</b> offers many <b>benefits</b> including the support to make positive lifestyle changes, {{the majority of}} families referred to treatment decline. Moreover, {{for those who do}} attend, benefits are often compromised by high programme attrition. This systematic review investigated factors influencing attendance at community-based lifestyle programmes among families of over-weight or obese children. A narrative synthesis approach was used to allow for the inclusion of quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method study designs. Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Results suggest that parents provided the impetus for programme initiation, and this was driven largely by a concern for their child 2 ̆ 7 s psychological health and wellbeing. More often than not, children went along without any real reason or interest in attending. Over the course of the programme, however, children 2 ̆ 7 s positive social experiences such as having fun and making friends fostered the desire to continue. The stigma surrounding excess weight and the denial of the issue amongst some parents presented barriers to enrolment and warrant further study. This study provides practical recommendations to guide future policy makers, programme delivery teams and researchers in developing strategies to boost recruitment and minimise attrition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Exercise {{programmes}} are {{beneficial for}} cancer patients however evidence {{is limited in}} patients with multiple myeloma (MM), a cancer that is characterised by osteolytic bone disease, giving rise {{to high levels of}} bone morbidity including fractures and bone pain. Methods We conducted a single arm phase 2 study of an exercise programme (EP) as rehabilitation for treated MM patients, to evaluate feasibility, effects on QOL and physiological parameters. Patients were given individualised programmes, comprising stretching, aerobic and resistance exercises, carried out under supervision for 3 months then at home for a further 3 months. Results Study uptake was high, 60 of 75 (80 %) patients approached consented to the study. Screen failures (11, due to fracture risk and disease relapse) and patient withdrawals (12) resulted in a final 37 patients enrolling on the programme. These 37 patients demonstrated high attendance rates in the supervised classes (87 %), and high levels of adherence in home exercising (73 %). Patients reported better QOL following the EP, with improvement in FACT-G and Fatigue scores over time from baseline (p Conclusions An EP in MM patients is feasible and safe, with high <b>attendance</b> and adherence. <b>Benefits</b> in QOL, fatigue and muscle strength await confirmation in randomized studies, prompting urgent evaluation of the benefits of EP in the rehabilitation of MM patients. </p...|$|R
