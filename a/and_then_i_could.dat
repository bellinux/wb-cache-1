2500|$|Before the {{publication}} of The Satanic Verses, the publisher received [...] "warnings from the publisher's editorial consultant" [...] that the book might be controversial. Later, Rushdie would reflect upon {{the time that the}} book was about to be published. Speaking to an interviewer, he said, [...] "I expected a few mullahs would be offended, call me names, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> defend myself in public... I honestly never expected anything like this".|$|E
6000|$|But {{by and by}} [...] You {{turned a}} yellow-green, Like a large glow-worm in the sky; [...] <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> descry [...] Your mood and mien.|$|E
60|$|Presently, to my intense relief, I saw old Billali hurrying towards us, <b>and</b> even <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} help {{smiling at}} the expression of consternation on his dignified countenance.|$|R
60|$|Now <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>could</b> gain a week's {{leave of}} absence, I {{returned}} to the village, and was received with tolerable politeness by my uncle, and with a warmer feeling by his daughter.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Resigned! What of that? I held my tongue! It was all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do! <b>I</b> {{never knew}} {{things could be}} worse till I saw it was killing him, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do was still to keep silence.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I could too," [...] said Rollo. [...] "I {{should like}} to climb up one of those trees which hangs over, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> look down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not so," [...] she answered, innocently, [...] "for I {{should have}} married {{him before he}} went, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have been certain that he would return here {{whenever}} I wished it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ross is my name. I {{have been}} {{watching}} by you!" [...] He looked surprised for an instant, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see that his habit of judging for himself came into play.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{has gone}} to her cousin's funeral, and won't be back till Monday. There {{seems to be a}} great {{fatality}} among her relations; for one dies, or comes to grief in some way, about once a month. But I don't blame poor Sally for wanting to get away from this place now <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> find it in my heart to murder an imaginary friend or two, if I had to stay here long." ...|$|R
60|$|There was no {{time for}} deliberation, and the sight of Chainbearer's escort, as they {{proceeded}} toward the storehouse, satisfied me that the girl was right. She held up the trap, and I descended into the hole that answered the purposes of a cellar. I heard Lowiny draw a chest over the trap, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> fancied <b>I</b> <b>could</b> distinguish the creaking of the rounds of the ladder, as she went up into the loft, which was the place where she usually slept.|$|R
60|$|On and on I went, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not escape}} my {{sinister}} pursuer. Suddenly I heard the shuffling noise at my right, and, looking, saw {{another pair of}} eyes, evidently approaching from an intersecting corridor. As I started to renew my slow retreat I heard the noise repeated behind me, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> turn <b>I</b> heard it again at my left.|$|R
6000|$|... "After all it's natural," [...] went on Willems, {{without paying}} any {{attention}} to Almayer--"it's natural that she should expect the advantages which [...] . <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> shut up that old wretch and then [...] ." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a {{momentary}} jerk of Mary's hand, {{as she was}} filling a tumbler, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see the restraint of self-command passing all over her. I had hit something, I knew; so I pursued my game.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Gillian {{must go to}} find it,' said Aunt Jane; 'and let me see, when have I a day? Saturday {{is never}} free, and Monday--I could ask Mrs. Hablot to take the cutting out, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> look up Lily's Brussels---' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{kept the}} half of your little nosegay till it {{withered}} entirely, <b>and</b> [...] even <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not bear to throw it away. I can't account for this, [...] nor can you either, I dare say."] ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then,</b> before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{make any}} answer such as I desired, such as I strove to make, my mother spoke again, and by her tone, which had grown faltering and tearful--as was her wont {{in the old}} days when she ruled my father--she riveted anew the fetters I was endeavouring with all the {{strength}} of my poor young soul to snap.|$|R
60|$|To my surprise, {{the general}} {{came out from}} his poor apology for a tent on hearing our voices, {{although}} we spoke cautiously low, <b>and</b> even <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> but ask myself why it was that an experienced soldier such as he was not giving more heed to his bodily welfare, for men {{on the eve of}} encountering a strong enemy surely need all the repose which can be had.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind that," [...] said Rollo. [...] "I {{should like}} that. I {{would put the}} top back, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see all around. I should have a grand ride. I'll go. I wish Jennie had not gone to bed; she could have gone with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me tell it all. Anton, and then, {{whatever}} they may say, {{whatever they}} may do, I shall not mind. I wish {{that they knew}} it, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> stand up against them. Then I could tell Ziska that which would make him hold his tongue for ever." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{waited at}} home until noon, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> wait no longer. Leaving {{a message of}} excuse for my mother (I had just sense of shame enough left to shrink from facing her), I hastened away to profit by my {{invitation}} {{on the very day}} when I received it.|$|E
6000|$|Nick {{looked at}} her askance. [...] "You say things every now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> for which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> really kill you. 'The article of the month,' for instance: <b>I</b> <b>could</b> kill you for that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure of that. But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> thought I ought,--just to,--know her {{a little}} better, you see. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> how <b>could</b> <b>I</b> presume to think she'd take me till she knew me a little better?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If the cramp in this leg {{had kept}} off five minutes longer," [...] he said, [...] "I would have reached that big hole, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have {{climbed over the}} top of the rocks, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have come down on the other side to the front door, and asked Maka to get me my clothes, so I would not have had to swim back at all." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{surprising}} how plainly I could hear Mary Phillips across the smooth, still water. The ships did not {{now seem to}} be moving at all; but soon they would be nearer, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> talk with Bertha. And soon after (it must be so) I would be with her.|$|E
60|$|The {{first time}} I went punting was in company {{with three other}} fellows; {{they were going to}} show me how to do it. We could not all start together, so I said I would go down first and get out the punt, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> potter about and {{practice}} a bit until they came.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a pity," [...] said Kate, [...] "that {{you could}} not bring the books here, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help you, for {{although}} I do not pretend to be deeply learned in scriptural knowledge, I daresay I know enough for your purpose; but why not get the books in London? Is there any necessity for buying them in Yarmouth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "These {{are only}} {{among the things}} that might be; but at the worst, I am certain to {{get some sort of}} post, at Alexandria, which would enable us to live without {{trenching}} upon the three months' pay that is offered me; <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see nothing better, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> return to Partridge's employment when they reopen here, and I have no doubt that they would improve my position.|$|R
60|$|MAGGIE. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> what <b>could</b> <b>I</b> do? For {{the desire}} of my life now, John, is to help you to get {{everything}} you want, except just that I {{want you to have}} me, too.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} that was not my character, Mr. Cathro; but I hope I have changed since <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> pull a boy {{out of the water}} without wanting to be extolled for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] said Tom, coloring; [...] "but {{my father}} is unwilling to risk it, and I don't like to press him. If I could get twenty or thirty pounds to begin with, I could pay five per cent for it, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{gradually}} make a little capital of my own, and do without a loan." ...|$|E
60|$|I had sat {{listening}} to these jolly folk {{for all this}} time, and I had not heard old Sindbad say a word, and yet I knew very well {{he was full of}} a story, for every now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see his lips move, and he would smile, and anon he would stroke his long white beard and smile again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Many of {{the friends}} of Congress in this county," [...] the man proceeded, [...] "wish the horse was led by some other officer. For my part, if I could only be covered by a troop now <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do many an {{important}} piece {{of service to the}} cause, to which this capture of the peddler would be a trifle." ...|$|E
60|$|He poised {{the knife}} {{for an instant}} in the air, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> interpose, he brought it down deftly through the head of my {{precious}} drum, and such a frightful, agonized squeal filled the room that even I shivered involuntarily, {{and for an instant}} I had a vivid vision of a pig struggling {{in the hands of a}} butcher. I laughed in spite of myself. But Nick regarded me soberly.|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> he left. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not {{understand}} this extraordinary procedure; so I presently gave up trying to, and dozed off to sleep. Pretty soon the watchman was back again, {{and this time}} he was gruff. I was annoyed. I said:-- ...|$|R
5000|$|In a {{newspaper}} interview, Henson later said: [...] “I {{was in the}} lead that had overshot the mark a couple of miles. We went back <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see that my footprints were the first at the spot.” [...] Henson proceeded to plant the American flag.|$|R
