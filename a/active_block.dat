40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes a way {{to improve}} cache performance via active management of a target cache space. As microprocessor speeds continue to grow faster than memory subsystem speeds, minimizing the average data access time grows in importance. As current data caches are often poorly and inefficiently managed, a good management technique can improve the average data access time. Cache management involves two main processes: block allocation decisions and block replacement decisions. <b>Active</b> <b>block</b> allocation can be performed most efficiently in multilateral caches (several distinct data stores with disjoint contents placed in parallel within L 1), where blocks exhibiting particular characteristics can {{be placed in the}} appropriate store.

30|$|In general, <b>active</b> <b>blocks,</b> faults, GPS {{movements}} and lithospheric strength in Mainland China all have close correlations with Bz. Boundaries of obvious magnetic anomalies often signify boundaries of <b>active</b> <b>blocks</b> or large faults (Fig.  3). Large GPS movements usually appear inside areas with obvious negative Bz (e.g. Tibet, Tianshan and Chuandian). Moreover, the GPS movements tend to decrease dramatically through negative Bz areas, {{which is most}} obvious in Tibet. Areas with obvious negative Bz often effect as absorbing the displacement, which result in crustal shortening and uplifting. By contrast, areas with obvious positive Bz (e.g. Tarim and Sichuan Basin) often effect as resisting, slowing and transmitting the crustal displacement, without obvious internal deformation. As for Bz and the lithospheric strength, strong lithosphere is commonly corresponding to obvious positive Bz (e.g. Tarim, Sichuan, Songliao and North China), and weak lithosphere is usually related to obvious negative Bz (e.g. Tibet and Chuandian, Fig.  4).|$|R

We propose <b>Active</b> <b>Block</b> Layer Extensions (ABLE), an operating system infrastructure that aids the development and manages the deployed instances of self-management extensions within the storage stack. ABLE develops a theory behind block layer extensions that helps address key questions about overall storage stack behavior, data consistency, and reliability.

Our initial experience with ABLE and few block layer extensions that we have been building, leads to believe that the ABLE infrastructure can substantially simplify the development and deployment of robust, self-managing, storage systems. 1...|$|E
40|$|Usage of Inductors as passive {{components}} in filter design poses {{a number of}} problems in terms of non-linearity, losses, large physical size, weight and possibility of their integration at very high frequencies only. Bulky nature of Inductors put a question mark on the foot print of filters designed using them. Microminiaturization of circuits resulted in desire for replacement of Inductors by active elements like Operational Amplifiers which led to the introduction of new class of filters called as active filters. Active filter design has evolved over a period of time.

The state-of-the-art medium-range ensemble forecasts performed well in simulating the frequencies of Euro-Atlantic (EA) and Pacific (PA) blockings, even after 216 -hr lead time, whereas they did not simulate well the frequencies of Greenland and Ural blockings, even {{in the middle of}} the forecast range. The ensemble forecasts are not always able to capture the blockings with high probability in the latter half of the forecast range. During this latter half, blocked flows were frequently predicted with low probability during the <b>active</b> <b>blocking</b> period, whereas they were seldom predicted with similar probability during the non-active blocking period. This result might suggest that the <b>active</b> <b>blocking</b> period is more chaotic than the non-active blocking period. In addition, it was more difficult to predict an onset of EA blocking than to predict an onset of PA blocking, and probabilistic blocking forecasting over the PA sector was more skillful than that over the EA sector.

Membranes that include material that instantly changes the solubility at the certain temperature have application in controlled drug delivery as well as the protein separation. Suitable material for the construction of that type of membrane should be the diblock-copolymer that consists of one <b>active</b> <b>block,</b> and hydrophobic matrix block. The active component should change its solubility at the temperature that is between the room temperature and human body temperature. The main challenges for the synthesis of the diblock-copolymer are high molar mass for the sufficient mechanical stability and low polydispersity index in order to obtain microphase separation. The mechanically stable components of the diblock copolymer were, polystyrene (PS), while as an active component, poly-(2 -(2 ethoxy) -ethoxy) methoxy methacrylate (PDMEEMA) was used. The synthesizes were done by the sequential anionic polymerization mechanism. The possibilities of prevention of unwanted side reactions on the carbonyle group of the methacrylate by the presence of the different cations in the reaction systems as well as the possible sterical hindering was tested.

40|$|The {{main problem}} of {{landfill}} management in Indonesia is {{the difficulty in}} getting a location for Final Processing Sites (FPS) due to limited land and high land prices. Besides, about 95 % of existing landfills are uncontrolled dumping sites, which could potentially lead to water, soil and air pollution. Based on data from the Ministry of Environment (2010), The Act of the Republic of Indonesia Number 18 Year 2008 Concerning Solid Waste Management, prohibits open dumping at final processing sites and in ratification, the Local Governments have to convert the open dump sites into controlled or sanitary landfill. The Research Institute for Human Settlements has been conducting multi-year researches related to the rehabilitation of dumpsites toward sustainable landfill. The research methods are literature reviews, experiments, laboratory analysis and field observations. A pilot model of dumpsite rehabilitation {{was carried out in}} 2010 at the Final Processing Site at Cikundul in Sukabumi City, consisting of (1) mining landfill (2) construction of landfill cells in a former mining area with a semi aerobic landfill and an anaerobic landfill and (3) landfill operations using decomposed material from landfill mining as a soil cover. The purpose of the study is to develop a sustainable approach for landfill management and rehabilitation through landfill mining and implementation of semi aerobic landfill. Findings in the construction of landfill mining indicate that (1) the construction of landfill mining is constrained by leachate that is trapped in a pile of waste, therefore, the leachate needs to be pumped to leachate treatment installations, (2) the volume of waste excavation is expanding due to the high plastic content of about 26 % in landfills (3) the potency of decomposed materials from landfill mining is 40 – 83 % for landfill operations or greening [...] The performance of landfill systems shows that leachate quality of semi aerobic landfill tends to be lower than that of anaerobic landfill. Gas composition at semi aerobic landfill in FPS Sukabumi shows about 6 – 10 % CH 4 and about 15 – 16 % O 2; for an aerobic landfill, the gas composition is about 47 – 57 % CH 4 and about 2 – 3 % O 2. In conclusion the concept mining landfill could be developed especially for big cities where it is difficult to find a new site for landfill or to get soil cover for landfill operation. In a sustainable approach, the excavated area can be turned into a new area for landfill cell so that the capacity of existing Final Processing Site can be expanded using the block landfill concept. The landfill should be divided into three blocks: compost block, composting block and <b>active</b> <b>block.</b> Usage of the three blocks are rotated with the intention of using solid waste on the compost block as soil material for the <b>active</b> <b>block</b> through landfill mining...|$|E
40|$|Field and {{earthquake}} {{data are}} presented which show that small faults can be important during block rotation. `Small' here means those faults which {{are at least}} {{an order of magnitude}} smaller than the largest faults at a particular scale of observation. The NW–SE-trending dextral faults of SW England have millimetres to kilometres of displacement. The largest of these faults, such as the Sticklepath–Lustleigh fault, do not appear to cause more than a few degrees of rotation from the general E–W strike of beds. Tens of degrees of rotation are often visible, however, on faults with millimetres of displacement. Similarly, the apparent rotation of beds in the Badajoz–Cordoba Shear Zone, Spain, increases as the resolution of the faults is increased. The power-law scaling relationship of earthquake magnitudes in the San Andreas fault zone illustrates that small faults can also be important in regions of <b>active</b> <b>block</b> rotation. `Small' faults can allow deformation within rotating blocks and can allow high displacement gradients to occur on the block-bounding faults. This would reduce the need for void creation, which is a requirement of rigid block rotation models. A tentative model is presented which incorporates the concept that fault behaviour is fractal, emphasising the contribution of small faults. It is suggested that future studies of block rotation should rigorously test the contribution of `small' faults, and that particular care is needed when comparing palaeomagnetic data with regional-scale structures...|$|E
