5|$|As {{commander}} <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Force,</b> Atlantic Fleet in 1940 and 1941 he supervised amphibious {{training and}} conducted Fleet Landing Exercises. In May 1942, Barbey {{was appointed to}} organize a new Amphibious Warfare Section within the Navy Department, which was charged with responsibility for the coordination of amphibious training and the development and production of {{the new generation of}} landing craft. In January 1943 he assumed command of <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Force,</b> Southwest Pacific Force, which became the VII <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Force.</b> He planned and carried out 56 amphibious assaults in the Southwest Pacific Area between September 1943 and July 1945. After the war, he commanded the Seventh Fleet and Fourth Fleet.|$|E
5|$|In 1941 Chase, now a {{lieutenant}} colonel, was posted to VIII Corps, then commanded by Major General Walter Krueger. As such, {{he participated in}} the Louisiana Maneuvers. In December 1941, he was posted to the <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Force,</b> Atlantic Fleet, then {{under the command of}} Major General Holland Smith. Based at Marine Corps Base Quantico, the <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Force</b> practiced Amphibious warfare tactics on Chesapeake Bay.|$|E
5|$|For MacArthur's long-awaited {{return to}} the Philippines in October 1944, the Seventh Fleet was massively {{reinforced}} by Nimitz's Pacific Fleet. Kinkaid commanded the assault personally, with Barbey's VII <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Force</b> as Task Force 78, joined by Vice Admiral Theodore S. Wilkinson's III <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Force</b> from the Pacific Fleet as Task Force 79. Kinkaid was also given Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's Task Force 77.2, a bombardment force built around six old battleships that had survived the attack on Pearl Harbor, and Rear Admiral Thomas L. Sprague's Task Force 77.4, a force of escort carriers. However, Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's Task Force 38, the covering force of the fast carriers and battleships, remained part of Admiral Halsey's Third Fleet, which was not under MacArthur or Kinkaid's command.|$|E

5|$|On 4 January 1943, Kinkaid became Commander of the North Pacific Force (COMNORPACFOR) {{following}} {{the failure of}} his predecessor, Rear Admiral Robert A. Theobald, to work harmoniously with the U.S. Army. Command relationships in the North Pacific were complicated. Naval forces came under Fletcher's Northwestern Sea Frontier. The troops in Alaska, including Brigadier General William O. Butler's Eleventh Air Force, were commanded by Major General Simon B. Buckner, Jr., who was answerable {{to the head of}} the Western Defense Command, Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt. Kinkaid's command was responsible for coordinating these forces and retaking the Aleutian Islands captured by the Japanese. He found the Army eager to cooperate, but encountered more difficulty with Rear Admiral Francis W. Rockwell, the commander of the <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Force,</b> Pacific Fleet, and later the IX <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Force.</b> Rockwell was an Academy classmate of Kinkaid's, who was senior to him in rank, and convinced that he would both plan and command the amphibious phase of the operation rather than Kinkaid.|$|E
5|$|Callaghan {{is perhaps}} best known for ordering, despite {{disagreement}} from some of his crew, that an honorable funeral be held for an enemy pilot who died during a suicide attack on the Missouri in 1945. Following World War II, he directed the US Navy's transportation service and filled senior command roles in eastern Asia, including leadership of the US Pacific Fleet's <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Force</b> during the Korean War. He retired from the US Navy at the rank of vice admiral in 1957 and worked in civilian maritime transport before retiring to Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Governor Moore {{received}} formal {{notification concerning}} the hostilities, and he organized and led a force against Spanish Florida. 500 English colonial soldiers and militia, along with 300 Indians, captured and burned {{the town of}} St. Augustine in the 1702 Siege of St. Augustine. The English were unable to take the main fortress and withdrew when a Spanish fleet arrived from Havana. In 1706, Carolina successfully repulsed an attack on Charles Town by a combined Spanish and French <b>amphibious</b> <b>force</b> sent from Havana.|$|E

5|$|In New Guinea, {{a country}} without roads, {{large-scale}} transportation {{of men and}} materiel {{would have to be}} accomplished by aircraft or ships. A multi-pronged approach was employed to solve this problem. Disassembled landing craft were shipped to Australia, where they were assembled in Cairns. The range of these small landing craft was to be greatly extended by the landing ships of the VII <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Force,</b> which began arriving in late 1942, and formed part of the newly formed Seventh Fleet. Since the Seventh Fleet had no aircraft carriers, the range of naval operations was limited by that of the fighter aircraft of the Fifth Air Force.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September, General Mark W. Clark, the Commander-In-Chief of United Nations Forces in Korea, came aboard Iowa. Clark {{observed}} Iowa {{in action}} as her guns shelled the Wonsan {{area for a}} third time, accounting {{for the destruction of}} a major enemy ammunition dump. On 25 September, Iowa fired her guns at an enemy railroad and 30-car train. The following month, Iowa was part of the force involved in Operation Decoy, a feint to draw enemy troops into Kojo and bring them within striking distance of the battleships' big guns. During the operation, Iowa provided anti-aircraft support to , an <b>amphibious</b> <b>force</b> command ship.|$|E
5|$|The Landing at Lae was an amphibious landing to {{the east}} of Lae and then the {{subsequent}} advance on the town during the Salamauaâ€“Lae campaign of World War II. Part of Operation Postern, which was undertaken to capture the Japanese base at Lae, the landing was undertaken between 4 and 6 September 1943 by Australian troops from the 9th Division, supported by US naval forces from the VII <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Force.</b> The first major amphibious operation undertaken by the Australian Army since the failed Gallipoli Campaign, the Australians invested a significant amount of effort into planning the operation.|$|E

5|$|The assault {{troops with}} their {{supplies}} and equipment {{had to be}} loaded on board the ships on 31 December 1943, just {{five days after the}} assault on Cape Gloucester. Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey's VII <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Force</b> allotted 6 Landing Ships, Tank (LSTs), 10 High speed transports (APDs) and 17 Landing Craft Infantry (LCIs). A last minute hitch developed on 30 December when it was discovered that only nine APDs would be available. New embarkation tables were drawn up, shifting personnel not required in the assault waves to LCIs, and the landing schedule was revised {{in the light of the}} reduced number of landing craft.|$|E
5|$|The seventh wave, {{made up of}} USS LST-67, LST-452, and LST-454, {{arrived at}} Scarlet Beach at midnight. As with the {{previous}} wave, each carried an Australian labour force which unloaded the LSTs {{under the direction of}} the Shore Battalion. The LSTs retracted at 03:00 in order to be well clear before dawn. During the first day, Australian casualties were 20 killed, 65 wounded, and nine missing, all of whom were eventually found to be either dead or wounded. The VII <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Force</b> reported that three men had been wounded.|$|E
5|$|Defeated at Lae, the Japanese {{pulled back}} to Finschhafen, which the Americans and Australians chose {{as the site}} of their next offensive. On 21 September an assault force under Barbey left Buna, escorted by US destroyers {{including}} Mahan, and stopped at Lae to pick up an Australian infantry brigade. Additional US destroyers were attached to the force, preceding the convoy to the rendezvous point. On 22 September, before daylight, the <b>amphibious</b> <b>force</b> stormed the beach at Finschhafen; by noon, all troops were ashore. As the destroyers began to withdraw from the area, ten Japanese torpedo planes winged across the water, targeting Mahan and five other US destroyers. The ships returned fire, shooting down eight of the ten planes; the remaining two escaped. This scrimmage ended without any hits by enemy planes. By 2 October, Finschhafen was {{in the hands of the}} Allies.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, Callaghan {{held the}} rank of rear admiral, and in that year he gave a {{presentation}} to the Naval War College on his experience in the Naval Transportation Service before the war. On October 1, 1949, he was appointed the first commander of the Military Sea Transportation Service, which would later become the Military Sealift Command. He was promoted from rear admiral to vice admiral around this time. From 1953 to 1954, during the Korean War, he commanded the <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Force</b> of the US Pacific Fleet. From 1954 to 1956, he served as Commander, US Naval Forces Far East. He then replaced retiring Vice Admiral Francis Low as Commander of the Western Sea Frontier. He retired from the US Navy at {{the rank of}} vice admiral in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Grant's career {{suffered}} temporarily in {{the aftermath}} of Shiloh. Halleck combined and reorganized his armies, relegating Grant to the powerless position of second-in-command. Meanwhile, Beauregard remained in command of the Army of Mississippi and led it back to Corinth. In late April and May, the Union armies, under Halleck's personal command, advanced slowly toward Corinth and captured it, while an <b>amphibious</b> <b>force</b> on the Mississippi River destroyed the Confederates' River Defense Fleet and captured Memphis, Tennessee. Halleck was promoted to be general in chief of all the Union armies. With Halleck's departure to the East, Grant was restored to command and eventually pushed down the Mississippi River to besiege Vicksburg, Mississippi. After the surrender of Vicksburg and the fall of Port Hudson in the summer of 1863, the Mississippi River was under Union control and the Confederacy was cut in two.|$|E
5|$|Other forces under Kinkaid's command {{included}} the cruisers of Task Force 74 under Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley, Task Force 75 under Russell S. Berkey, and Task Force 76, the VII <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Force,</b> under Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey. The main {{role of the}} Seventh Fleet was supporting MacArthur's drive along the northern coast of New Guinea {{with a series of}} 38 amphibious operations, usually directed by Barbey. Kinkaid accompanied MacArthur for the landing in the Admiralty Islands, where the two men came ashore a few hours after the assault troops. With 215 vessels involved, Operations Reckless and Persecution in April 1944 together constituted the largest operation in New Guinea waters. It was followed in quick succession by four more operations, at Wakde, Biak, Noemfor and Sansapor.|$|E

5|$|Therefore, {{the first}} Persian {{invasion}} of Greece effectively {{began in the}} following year, 492 BC, when Mardonius was dispatched (via Ionia) to complete the pacification of the land approaches to Greece and push on to Athens and Eretria if possible. Thrace was re-subjugated, having broken loose from Persian rule during the revolts and Macedon compelled to become a vassal of Persia. However, progress was halted by a naval disaster. A second expedition was launched in 490 BC under Datis and Artaphernes, son of the satrap Artaphernes. This <b>amphibious</b> <b>force</b> sailed across the Aegean, subjugating the Cyclades, before arriving off Euboea. Eretria was besieged, captured and destroyed, and the force then moved onto Attica. Landing at the Bay of Marathon, they were met by an Athenian army and defeated in the famous Battle of Marathon, ending the first Persian attempt to subdue Greece.|$|E
5|$|He briefly {{commanded}} the regimental depot, {{before returning to}} the peninsula in 1811 as General Thomas Picton's aide-de-camp, and later assistant adjutant-general (AAG) to Picton's 3rd Division, he received a majority by brevet on 28 April 1812, and a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy on 26 August 1813. He held the position of AAG {{until the end of the}} Peninsular War in 1814, and received the Gold Cross with two clasps for his services. When an <b>amphibious</b> <b>force</b> was sent to North America in 1814 during the War of 1812, Stovin was appointed its deputy adjutant-general; he was wounded at the Battle of New Orleans. He prosecuted the case of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Mullins when the force returned to the United Kingdomâ€”Mullins, commanding the 44th Foot, had been charged with neglecting orders during the battle. As a result, although he had been assigned to Picton's staff, he missed the opportunity to serve with him in the Waterloo Campaign.|$|E
5|$|On 16 September, the day Lae fell, MacArthur {{ordered that}} Finschhafen be {{captured}} {{as soon as}} possible. The following day he held a conference at Port Moresby. He and Blamey selected the second contingency, a landing by a brigade of the 9th Division. Brigadier Victor Windeyer's 20th Infantry Brigade was chosen as it was still relatively fresh, and had experience with amphibious operations from the landing at Lae. The 6th Division's movement to New Guinea was postponed. Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey, {{the commander of the}} VII <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Force,</b> had originally counted on four weeks break between the fall of Lae and the Finschhafen operation. On 9 September, he had told Herring that it would require a minimum of ten days. Under pressure from MacArthur, Barbey cut that to three days. This was too soon for Herring to get the troops together, and 21 September was selected as the target date. Herring briefed Windeyer on the operation on 18 September. Windeyer felt that the schedule was still too tight, and it was postponed one more day to 22 September.|$|E
