5|$|Executive {{producer}} and head writer Steven Moffat wrote the episode as an introduction for Amy {{into the role}} of the Doctor's companion. The episode showcases her first adventure away from her home world and her first time in space. The climax of the episode, where the Doctor decides the best thing he can do is kill the Star Whale as painlessly as possible but Amy comes up with an <b>alternative</b> <b>solution</b> that is more humane, was designed to stand out in the Doctor's memory as a failure of a huge scale. It also reinforced the Doctor's need for a companion and showed how important Amy would be to him.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} of Apollonius' problem to three dimensions, namely, {{the problem of}} finding a fifth sphere that is tangent to four given spheres, can be solved by analogous methods. For example, the given and solution spheres can be resized so that one given sphere is shrunk to point while maintaining tangency. Inversion in this point reduces Apollonius' problem to finding a plane that is tangent to three given spheres. There are in general eight such planes, which become the solutions to the original problem by reversing the inversion and the resizing. This problem was first considered by Pierre de Fermat, and many <b>alternative</b> <b>solution</b> methods have been developed over the centuries.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Rossall had made plans to accommodate Westminster School however these plans were scrapped when the government requisitioned the campus for several departments of the Office of Works, the Board of Education and the Ministry of Pensions. As a result, the school moved to Naworth Castle. The government departments put up prefabricated buildings and found other premises close by as soon as possible, and left in 1940. The school returned and took in a school from the south-east, as the Westminster School had found an <b>alternative</b> <b>solution.</b> The eventual choice was that of Alleyn's who had to be evacuated from London {{as a result of the}} risk of bombing. Another side effect of the war was that there was only one centenary dinner celebrating the 100th year of Rossall. It was conducted by Old Rossallians imprisoned in Changi Prison, a notorious POW camp in Singapore during the Japanese occupation.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{theory of}} ethnic tension {{resolution}} is non-territorial autonomy or NTA. NTA {{has emerged in}} recent years as an <b>alternative</b> <b>solution</b> to ethnic tensions and grievances in places that are likely to breed conflict. For this reason, NTA has been promoted as a more practical and state building solution than consociationalism. NTA, alternatively known as non-cultural autonomy (NCA), is based on the difference of jus solis and jus sanguinis, the principles of territory versus that of personhood. It gives rights to ethnic groups to self-rule and govern matters potentially concerning but limited to: education, language, culture, internal affairs, religion, and the internally established institutions needed to promote and reproduce these facets. In contrast to federalism, the ethnic groups are not assigned a titular sub-state, but rather the ethnic groups are dispersed throughout the state unit. Their group rights and autonomy are not constrained to a particular territory within the state. This is done in order not to weaken the center state such {{as in the case of}} ethnofederalism.|$|E
40|$|Self-repairing {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} to alleviate the runtime requirements satisfaction problem by switching to appropriate <b>alternative</b> <b>solutions</b> according to the feedback monitored. However, little has been done formally on analyzing the relations between specific environmental failures and corresponding repairing decisions, making it a challenge to derive a set of <b>alternative</b> <b>solutions</b> to withstand possible environmental failures at runtime. To address these challenges, we propose a requirements-driven self-repairing approach against environmental failures, which combines both development-time and runtime techniques. At the development phase, in a stepwise manner, we formally analyze the issue of self-repairing against environmental failures {{with the support of}} the model checking technique, and then design a sufficient and necessary set of <b>alternative</b> <b>solutions</b> to withstand possible environmental failures. The runtime part is a runtime self-repairing mechanism that monitors the operating environment for unsatisfiable situations, and makes self-repairing decisions among <b>alternative</b> <b>solutions</b> in response to the detected environmental failures...|$|R

25|$|Although {{covered in}} {{industry}} technical standards, {{there is still}} some disagreement on the best way to handle the use of pin 1 for grounding (earthing). The main controversy is whether the shell of the connector should be connected to pin 1 or the shield, or left floating. AES standards mentioned above recommend that shells of cable-mounted connectors should never be connected to pin 1 or the shield, because inadvertent contact of the shell with another grounded surface while in use can create unwanted current paths for fault current, potentially causing hum and other noise. On the other hand, equipment containing active circuitry should always have pin 1 connected to the conductive enclosure of the equipment {{as close as possible to}} the point where the signal enters the enclosure. The argument centers on the radio frequency shielding provided by the shell of the connector, which may be reduced if it is left floating. An <b>alternative</b> <b>solution</b> is to connect the shell to pin 1 and the shield through a small value capacitor, providing RF shielding but allowing very little audio-frequency current to flow. This capability can be built into a fixed jack or a cable terminated with XLR connectors.|$|E
500|$|In May 1991, the Connecticut Historic Bridge Inventory plan {{outlined}} {{a plan for}} the preservation of the Samson Occom Bridge. It is unlikely that traffic would require replacement or modification of the bridge in the foreseeable future. According to a 2011 Connecticut Department of Transportation report, the bridge carries 1,100 vehicles per day. The biggest threat to the bridge is moisture control and the repair of eroded surfaces. Stone arch bridges rarely require structural rehabilitation, but an <b>alternative</b> <b>solution</b> to structural rehabilitation would be to use concrete slab imbedded above the arch, only requiring raising the roadway. The report stated that the [...] "rustic quality" [...] of the bridge is not compatible with roadways larger than two lanes, but that additional width could be facilitated without compromising its historical significance.|$|E
500|$|Edward {{proposed}} an <b>alternative</b> <b>solution</b> of a morganatic marriage, {{in which he}} would remain king but Simpson would not become queen. She would enjoy some lesser title instead, and any children they might have would not inherit the throne. This too was rejected by the British Cabinet as well as other Dominion governments, whose views were sought pursuant to the Statute of Westminster 1931, which provided in part that [...] "any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles shall hereafter require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the United Kingdom." [...] The Prime Ministers of Australia (Joseph Lyons), Canada (Mackenzie King) and South Africa (J. B. M. Hertzog) made clear their opposition to the king marrying a divorcée; their Irish counterpart (Éamon de Valera) expressed indifference and detachment, while the Prime Minister of New Zealand (Michael Joseph Savage), having never heard of Simpson before, vacillated in disbelief. Faced with this opposition, Edward at first responded that there were [...] "not many people in Australia" [...] and their opinion did not matter.|$|E

500|$|During 1931, NSS {{was busy}} closing shipyards {{elsewhere}} in the country, while an order from the Admiralty for two destroyers kept Palmer's working until mid-1932. The second of these ships, , was the last ship launched from the yard, on 19 July 1932. [...] By this time, Palmer's was insolvent, but retained a faint hope of further naval contracts. These failed to materialise, and in June 1933 the firm's creditors appointed a receiver. By December 1933 rumours of NSS interest in the yard were appearing in the press, and in the House of Commons Walter Runciman, the President of the Board of Trade, told members: [...] "There {{is nothing to be}} gained by giving Jarrow the impression that Palmer's can be revived". He continued: [...] "Would it not be very much better to make a clean sweep of that as a shipyard, and throw open to the world for sale what is one of the finest and most convenient sites anywhere in Europe?" [...] Despite efforts by management and workers to find an <b>alternative</b> <b>solution,</b> in the early summer of 1934 NSS acquired the yard, closed it, and began to dismantle its plant.

500|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that Descartes explained the problem cogently, few later philosophers have been happy with his solution, and his ideas about the pineal gland have especially been ridiculed. [...] However, no <b>alternative</b> <b>solution</b> has gained general acceptance. [...] Proposed solutions can be divided broadly into two categories: [...] dualist solutions that maintain Descartes' rigid distinction between the realm of consciousness and the realm of matter but give different answers for how the two realms relate to each other; and monist solutions that maintain that there is really only one realm of being, of which consciousness and matter are both aspects. [...] Each of these categories itself contains numerous variants. [...] The two main types of dualism are substance dualism (which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed {{by the laws of}} physics) and property dualism (which holds that the laws of physics are universally valid but cannot be used to explain the mind). [...] The three main types of monism are physicalism (which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way), idealism (which holds that only thought or experience truly exists, and matter is merely an illusion), and neutral monism (which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them). [...] There are also, however, a large number of idiosyncratic theories that cannot cleanly be assigned to any of these schools of thought.|$|E
