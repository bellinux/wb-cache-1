"The general discontent I {{felt with}} woman's portion as wife, housekeeper, physician, and spiritual guide, the chaotic {{conditions}} into which everything fell without her constant supervision, and the wearied, anxious {{look of the}} majority of women, impressed me with a strong feeling that some active measures should be taken to remedy the wrongs of society in general, and of women in particular. My experience at the World Anti-slavery Convention, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> read of the legal status of women, and the oppression I saw everywhere, together swept across my soul, intensified now by many personal experiences.

500|$|Despite {{his initial}} reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving {{practical}} advice {{to help the}} composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, {{and to get the}} orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, [...] "I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now." [...] However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was [...] "now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring".|$|E

It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to do was let myself go and {{it was going to}} feel amazing. I wasn't {{trying to get away from}} anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from the}} romantic theme in her storyline Ruby {{has been shown}} as an {{aspiring}} singer. Breeds is classically trained in real life and said she doesn't mind singing on camera. Discussing this she stated: [...] "When you're playing a character you can hide behind them. I know it's still my voice, [...] I was more confident singing from Ruby's point of view. Even {{though there was a}} storyline where she was terrified about singing in a school play, I wasn't nervous at <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to try really hard to make myself feel nervous." [...] She revealed she had to play down her voice and make it [...] "a bit cleaner" [...] and a [...] "bit more inexperienced". This was due to the fact {{it was meant to be}} that she had never sung before – [...] "I have to pull her back a bit." [...] She added the storyline was realistic because there are no set guidelines for discovering vocal talent.|$|E

Tim Byron, writer for The Vine, [...] "'Grenade' is about the feeling of [...] ". The critic added, [...] "Mars knows she is bad for him, that's she's preventing him from thinking straight, that he can't actually have her the way he wants, but he still nonetheless has crazy desires for that rush of romantic cocaine that he gets from her." [...] As Mars commented in an interview to Blues & Soul: [...] "'Grenade' represents the OTHER side of love– where you're in love with a woman and you {{know for a fact that}} she doesn't love you the way you love HER." ...|$|E

[...] Because of the remoteness of the work camp, she was at a reduced risk from the local population who Frank feared would eat her. Frank credited Judy with saving his life during his time spent there, [...] "She saved my life in so many ways. The greatest way of all was giving me a reason to live. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to do was look at her and into those weary, bloodshot eyes and I would ask myself: What would happen to her if I died? I had to keep going. Even if it meant waiting for a miracle." [...] A radarman named Tom Scott later wrote that Frank and Judy shared an unusual bond, with Frank able to send the dog into the jungle with a click and recall her with a whistle. On one occasion, Frank found Judy attempting to bury an elephant's leg bone.|$|E

[...] His time of 20.46seconds to cover [...] was remarkable considering that three days of rain {{before the start of the}} race had turned the track into a muddy quagmire.

500|$|At {{least five}} {{species have been}} given {{scientific}} names honoring Colbert. In 2008 a species of California trapdoor spider was named Aptostichus stephencolberti. The spider was named for Colbert after he reported on his television series that Jason Bond, a {{professor of biology at}} East Carolina University, had named a different species of spider Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi after the Canadian rock star Neil Young, and began to appeal for a species of animal to be named after him. On a later edition of The Colbert Report, Colbert revealed that Bond would name a spider after him, with Colbert claiming, [...] "And <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to do was shamelessly beg on national television." [...] Other species named for Colbert include a species of Venezuelan diving beetle named Agaporomorphus colberti and a Chilean stonefly named Diamphipnoa colberti, both formally described in 2008. On his 45th birthday, Colbert was sent a framed print of his eponymous beetle by the biologists who named it. In 2014, a species of parasitic wasp from Ecuador, Aleiodes colberti, was named for Colbert, along with newly described species named for celebrities Jon Stewart, Jimmy Fallon, Ellen DeGeneres, and Shakira, and in 2016 a rove beetle, Sonoma colberti, was named after Colbert's on-screen persona.|$|E
500|$|Beatrice {{was born}} at Buckingham Palace. She was the fifth {{daughter}} and youngest of the nine children of the reigning British monarch, Queen Victoria, and her husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (later The Prince Consort). The birth caused controversy {{when it was announced}} that Queen Victoria would seek relief from the pains of delivery through the use of chloroform administered by Dr John Snow. Chloroform was considered dangerous to mother and child and was frowned upon by the Church of England and the medical authorities. Queen Victoria was undeterred and used [...] "that blessed chloroform" [...] for her last pregnancy. A fortnight later, Queen Victoria reported in her journal, [...] "I was amply rewarded and forgot <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gone through when I heard dearest Albert say 'It's a fine child, and a girl!'" [...] Albert and Queen Victoria chose the names Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore: Mary after Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester, the last surviving child of King George III of the United Kingdom; Victoria after the Queen; and Feodore after Feodora, Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, the Queen's older half-sister. She was baptised in the private chapel at Buckingham Palace on 16 June 1857. Her godparents were the Duchess of Kent (maternal grandmother); the Princess Royal (eldest sister); and the Prince Frederick of Prussia (her future brother-in-law).|$|E

500|$|Shakira was {{mindful of}} the many critics who would judge her second album, because of the [...] "phenomenon" [...] label applied to her. She knew that some would say that [...] "she had changed too much" [...] and others would reproach her if she {{remained}} the same. [...] "All I could do was to be myself. I understood that <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to do was write the music I knew how to write and to write from the heart when I was compelled to. In that way, everything developed naturally, more so than I could have imagined", she said. In addition, Shakira insisted on perfection, working on the material {{to the point of}} exhaustion. [...] "I made two or three demos of each song. I became a human being so demanding of myself that until the song made my hair stand on end, I wouldn't stop". For the recording of Dónde Están los Ladrones? they were used old amplifiers to achieve a better sound, a German microphone with more than 40 years of existence and made several innovations in the instrumental mixes. Dónde Están los Ladrones? took nine months to produce in total, since more people worked on the album compared with her previous record. Shakira commented, [...] "To me it's a normal time, the gestation period for a baby. But many people wag their finger and tell me that the next one cannot take so long..." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2013, Cielo {{confirmed}} {{his place in}} the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, in Barcelona, in the 50-metre freestyle, with the second best time {{in the world of the}} year: 21.57 seconds. He also qualified for the 50-metre butterfly. Due to his operation in both knees, Cielo did not compete in the 100-metre freestyle and the Brazilian relays. In the competition, Cielo became two-time World Champion of the 50-metre butterfly. The semifinals were the strongest stage of the race, with five swimmers earning times below 23 seconds. Cielo went to the final in second place with a time of 22.86 seconds, behind his compatriot Nicholas Santos. In the final, the athletes' performance was not the same, but Cielo showed more consistency and won the gold with a time of 23.01 seconds. In the 50-metre freestyle, Cielo reached the final with the third fastest time, 21.60 seconds, tied with Nathan Adrian. Florent Manaudou and Anthony Ervin qualified for the final as favorites, with strong times of 21.37 and 21.42 seconds respectively, in the second semifinal. But, in a final with a high technical level in which three Olympic champions (Manaudou, Cielo and Ervin) were competing, Cielo earned the best time of his life without a high-tech suit (and an unofficial world fastest time swum in textile), 21.32 seconds, becoming the first three-time World Champion of the event. Manaudou and Ervin did not even reach the podium. It was Cielo's sixth gold medal in individual events at the World Championships. With this result, Cielo overcame Alexander Popov and became the sprinter with more individual golds in World Championship history. Only four male swimmers have won more gold individual medals in World Championships than Cielo: Aaron Peirsol (7), Grant Hackett (7), Ryan Lochte (9) and Michael Phelps (15). Regarding his gold medal in the 50-metre freestyle, Cielo assured his fans that it was the most important gold of his career, declaring at the World Championships: [...] "It was certainly different from all others. Each medal has a different feeling. This was the most special of my life. From London, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to overcome... it was very exciting". Cielo's results were considered a [...] "redemption", because of low expectations entering the 2013 World Championships due to the troubled period following the London Olympics, when he underwent surgery on both knees, left his club and changed his coach.|$|E
