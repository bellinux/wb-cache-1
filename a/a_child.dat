40|$|Background Due {{to limited}} {{information}} on sugar drink counseling, characteristics {{of parents who}} reported ever receiving counseling from <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> doctor to limit <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> sugar drink intake were examined. Methods This cross-sectional analysis was conducted on a convenient sample of 1570 US parents (aged 18 years) using the 2009 HealthStyles Survey. The outcome measure was parents with children aged 18 years who reported being told by <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> doctor to limit <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> sugar drink intake. Data were weighted to provide national estimates. Multivariable logistic regression {{was used to examine}} factors associated with ever receiving sugar-drink counseling from <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> doctor.

50|$|Although limited, {{research}} suggests that young children may have differing definitions of lies than older children and adults.

Experts from all included disciplines reported that assessing <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> concept of pain is important and useful both clinically and in a research setting (> 80 % reported very or extremely useful for each item). Experts considered that the content of 13 items from currently published adult-targeted resources was useful, but the wording was too complex for children aged 8 – 12 years. Experts considered that all seven of the proposed domains of <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> concept of pain was important to assess.
