Methods 　We put mice into high <b>altitude</b> <b>hypoxia</b> cabin to establish high <b>altitude</b> <b>hypoxia</b> model mice. Sixty Kunming mice were randomly divided into control group, model group, Astragalus-Lily particles (ALP) low, medium and high dose groups [1. 75, 3. 5, 7 g/(kg•d) ] respectively. After {{three days of}} routine feeding, the ALP mice received drug by intragastric administration, once a day for continuous 17 days，control group and model group were given double distilled water in same volume. From the 15 th day, all the mice but control group were exposed to simulated high <b>altitude</b> <b>hypoxia</b> condition for 3 days in a high <b>altitude</b> <b>hypoxia</b> cabin after they were gavaged {{for half an hour}} daily. By the 18 th day, the fresh mouse feces were collected and smeared to observe the changes of microflora. The pathological changes of intestinal tissues were observed by HE staining and the expression of HIF- 1 αprotein in intestines was detected by immunohistochemistry. Results 　The enterococci and gram negative bacteria showed a higher proportion (65. 2 %± 2. 4 % and 56. 7 %± 3. 3 %, respectively) in the model group compared with the control group (24. 7 %± 1. 2 %, 23. 2 %± 1. 5 %, respectively, P< 0. 05).

40|$|Background Altitude {{acclimatization}} is {{a physiological}} process that restores oxygen delivery to the tissues and promotes oxygen use under high <b>altitude</b> <b>hypoxia.</b> High altitude sickness occurs in individuals without acclimatization. Unraveling the molecular underpinnings of altitude acclimatization could help understand the beneficial body responses to high <b>altitude</b> <b>hypoxia</b> {{as well as}} the altered biological events in un-acclimatized individuals. This study assessed physiological adjustments and circulating microRNA (cmiRNA) profiles in individuals exposed to high altitude, aiming to explore altitude acclimatization in humans. MethodsNinety volunteers were enrolled in this study. Among them, 22 individuals provided samples for microRNA arrays; 68 additional individuals constituted the validation set. Un-acclimatized individuals were identified by the Lake Louise Scoring System. Thirty-three phenotypes were recorded pre- and post-exposure to high altitude, including stress hormones, lipid profiles, hematological indices, myocardial enzyme spectrum, and liver and kidney function related enzymes. CmiRNA expression profiles were assessed using miRCURYTM LNA Array (v. 18. 0) screening, with data validated by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Then, associations of plasma microRNA expression with physiological adjustments were evaluated. The biological relevance of the main differentially expressed cmiRNAs was explored by bioinformatics prediction. ResultsNineteen of the 33 phenotypes were significantly altered during early altitude acclimatization, including hematological indices, lipid profiles, and stress hormones; meanwhile, 86 cmiRNAs (79 up-regulated and 7 down-regulated) showed differential expression with statistical significance. Among them, 32 and 25 microRNAs were strongly correlated with low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and total cholesterol elevations, respectively. In addition, 22 microRNAs were closely correlated with cortisol increase. In un-acclimatized individuals, 55 cmiRNAs were up-regulated and 36 down-regulated, compared with acclimatized individuals. The HIF signaling pathway was suppressed in un-acclimatized individuals. ConclusionPhysiological adjustments, including the hematological system, stress hormones, and lipid molecules contributed to early altitude acclimatization, and showed strong correlations with cmiRNA reprogramming. Moreover, acclimatized and un-acclimatized individuals showed different cmiRNA profile. Suppression of the HIF- 1 signaling pathway by microRNA regulation may {{play a key role in}} the pathogenesis of un-acclimatization with high <b>altitude</b> <b>hypoxia...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to its role in elevating red blood cell number, erythropoietin (Epo) exerts protective functions against acute and delayed degenerative diseases of the brain. Moreover, we have recently demonstrated that endogenously synthesized Epo and soluble Epo receptor (a negative regulator of Epo binding to the Epo receptor) in {{the central nervous system}} {{play a crucial role in}} facilitating the ventilatory response and acclimatization to hypoxia. Here we hypothesized that cerebral Epo in the brainstem is implicated in the process that allows cardiorespiratory acclimatization to high <b>altitude</b> <b>hypoxia</b> during the postnatal period. Thus, we evaluated the postnatal ontogeny of cerebral Epo concentration of Sprague-Dawley rats living and reproducing at high altitude for longer than 19 years (3600 m in La Paz, Bolivia). Our results show that postnatal Epo concentration in high-altitude rats is higher in the brainstem than in the forebrain. Moreover, although Epo concentration in the forebrain of high-altitude rats is similar to sea-level controls, Epo level in the brainstem is surprisingly 2 -fold higher in high-altitude rats than in sea-level controls. These findings strongly suggest that brainstem Epo plays an important role in tolerance to high <b>altitude</b> <b>hypoxia</b> after birth. From a clinical perspective, a better understanding of the role of Epo in the postnatal development of cardiorespiratory responses in neonates exposed to acute or chronic hypoxia might be useful...|$|E

Fetuses of pregnant ewes that were held at 3820 -m altitude from[*]∼ 30 to 140 days (LTH) gestation and sea-level control pregnant ewes were delivered near term.

In the sea level residents there was a significant increase in the pre-ejection period (PEP), abbreviation of the left ventricular ejection time (LVET), both corrected for heart rate, and prolongation of the PEP/LVET ratio at high altitude. The maximum changes were seen on days 2 and 3; these parameters tended to approach sea level control values by the tenth day. The systolic time interval values of high altitude residents were similar to the control values of the sea level residents obtained at sea level but significantly different from the changes in the sea level values seen in the first 4 days at high altitude. It thus appears that while the high altitude residents do not show any left ventricular dysfunction as determined by systolic time intervals, healthy sea level residents when exposed to high <b>altitude</b> <b>hypoxia</b> show a significant depression of the left ventricular function for at least the first 4 days.

40|$|Abstract. Chronic {{intermittent}} high <b>altitude</b> (IHA) <b>hypoxia</b> {{results in}} long-term adaptation protecting the heart against acute ischemia/reperfusion injury; however, molecular mechanisms {{of this phenomenon}} are not completely elucidated so far. The present study was aimed at investigation of a modulating effect of IHA hypoxia on the expression and/or activation of selected regulatory proteins, with particular emphasis on differential responses in the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV). Adult male Wistar rats were exposed to IHA hypoxia of 7000 m simulated in a hypobaric chamber (8 h/day, 25 exposures), and protein contents and activities in myocardial fractions were determined by Western blot analysis. In markedly hypertrophic RV of hypoxic rats, gelatinolytic activity of MMP- 2 and protein levels of carbonic anhydrase IX (a marker of hypoxia) were significantly enhanced. Study of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) revealed no differences in the contents of total p 38 -MAPK in both ventricles between the IHA and normoxic control rats, whereas activation of p 38 -MAPK was decreased in the RV and moderately increased in the LV of IHA rats as compared to controls.

2500|$|Hyperventilation depletes {{the blood}} of carbon dioxide (hypocapnia), which causes {{respiratory}} alkylosis (increased pH), and causes a leftward shift in the oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve.

[...] Hypoxia produces a respiratory drive but {{not as strong as}} the hypercapnic respiratory drive. This has been studied in <b>altitude</b> medicine, where <b>hypoxia</b> occurs without hypercapnia due to the low ambient pressure. The balance between the hypercapnic and hypoxic respiratory drives has genetic variability and can be modified by hypoxic training.

40|$|Acute {{exposure}} to hypoxia causes chemoreflex {{activation of the}} sympathetic nervous system. During acclimatization to high <b>altitude</b> <b>hypoxia,</b> arterial oxygen content recovers, but it is unknown to what degree sympathetic activation is maintained or normalized during prolonged {{exposure to}} hypoxia. We therefore measured sympathetic nerve activity directly by peroneal microneurography in eight healthy volunteers (24 ± 2 years of age) after 4 weeks {{at an altitude of}} 5260 m (Chacaltaya, Bolivian Andes) and at sea level (Copenhagen). The subjects acclimatized well to altitude, but in every subject sympathetic nerve activity was highly elevated at altitude vs. sea level (48 ± 5 vs. 16 ± 3 bursts min− 1, respectively, P < 0. 05), coinciding with increased mean arterial blood pressure (87 ± 3 vs. 77 ± 2 mmHg, respectively, P < 0. 05). To examine the underlying mechanisms, we administered oxygen (to eliminate chemoreflex activation) and saline (to reduce cardiopulmonary baroreflex deactivation). These interventions had minor effects on sympathetic activity (48 ± 5 vs. 38 ± 4 bursts min− 1, control vs. oxygen + saline, respectively, P < 0. 05). Moreover, sympathetic activity was still markedly elevated (37 ± 5 bursts min− 1) when subjects were re-studied under normobaric, normoxic and hypervolaemic conditions 3 days after return to sea level. In conclusion, acclimatization to high <b>altitude</b> <b>hypoxia</b> is accompanied by a striking and long-lasting sympathetic overactivity. Surprisingly, chemoreflex activation by hypoxia and baroreflex deactivation by dehydration together could account for {{only a small part of}} this response, leaving the major underlying mechanisms unexplained...|$|E

We have observed that after a period of 3 to 8 years of CIH exposure workers acclimatize well, and evidence from our studies and those of others indicates that CIH induces acute and chronic multisystem adjustments which are effective in offsetting the reduced availability of oxygen at high altitudes. The aims of this review are to summarize findings of the physiological responses to CIH exposure, highlighting outstanding issues in the field...|$|R
40|$|The obesity {{epidemic}} {{calls for}} novel strategies {{to prevent and}} treat obesity and its comorbidities. Several {{studies have indicated that}} the amount of oxygen to which tissues are exposed may substantially impact cardiometabolic health. Interestingly, living at high <b>altitude</b> (hypobaric <b>hypoxia)</b> seems to be associated with improved glucose homeostasis and a decreased prevalence of Type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, normobaric hypoxia exposure has been shown to exert beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in rodents and humans. This may, at least in part, be explained by altered adipose tissue and skeletal muscle oxygen tension. In contrast, patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, which is characterised by episodes of severe intermittent hypoxia due to periodic collapse of the upper airway during sleep, show impairments in glucose homeostasis and are at increased cardiovascular risk. These discrepancies may be explained by the severity, duration, and pattern (number of cycles) of hypoxic episodes, but underlying mechanisms have not yet been studied in detail. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of available studies on the link between oxygen tension, inflammation, and glucose homeostasis. Detailed studies to elucidate the effects of moderate hypoxia exposure on wholebody and tissue-specific insulin sensitivity in humans are clearly warranted...|$|R
