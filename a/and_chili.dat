5|$|The {{portion of}} NY386 between Scottsville <b>and</b> <b>Chili</b> was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} Route16, an unsigned legislative route, in 1908. This section of Route16 became part of Route15 in 1921. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, this segment of Route15 was incorporated into NY251, a new route established {{as part of the}} renumbering. NY386 was assigned by the following year to the portion of its modern routing north of NY31. It was extended south to Scottsville over former NY251 on July 1, 1977. In 2007, ownership and maintenance of most of NY386 between NY33A and NY104 was transferred from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to Monroe County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} NY386 between Scottsville and NY33A in Chili was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} Route16, an unsigned legislative route extending from Cuba to Rochester, in 1908. On March1, 1921, Route16 was truncated to end at Route6 (modern NY5) in Le Roy {{as part of a}} partial renumbering of New York's legislative route system. The portion of former Route16 north of Caledonia became part of Route15. The section of Route15 between Scottsville <b>and</b> <b>Chili</b> became part of NY251, a new route stretching from NY33 in Gates to then-NY15 in Victor, in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY386, meanwhile, was assigned by the following year to the portion of Elmgrove Road between NY31 in Gates and U.S. Route104 (now NY104) in Greece.|$|E

5|$|When NY47 {{was first}} {{commissioned}} in the Rochester area , it was routed along previously unnumbered roadways, with its northwest terminus {{located at the}} intersection of NY31 (Lyell Avenue) and Howard Road in Gates. NY47 took Howard Road south, passing through Gates Center and intersecting NY33 before crossing the then-New York Central Railroad main line (now the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision) at-grade. The route remained on Howard Road until the intersection of Howard Road <b>and</b> <b>Chili</b> Avenue (NY33A), which also included Brooks Avenue at this juncture of time. NY47 turned east onto Brooks Avenue and proceeded toward the Greater Rochester International Airport, joining the current routing of NY204 at Beahan Road (now Old Beahan Road).|$|E
5|$|A {{short time}} later, Luke escapes again by using string to shake a bush and {{distract}} the guards, visiting a nearby {{house where he}} uses an axe to remove his shackles. To keep the guard dogs from following his scent, he spreads curry powder <b>and</b> <b>chili</b> powder across the ground to send them into sneezing fits and overload their sensitive sense of smell. While free, Luke mails Dragline a magazine that includes a photograph of him with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. Luke is warned by the Captain that if he ever attempts to escape again, he will be killed on the spot. Luke is now annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and reveals {{it to be a}} fake. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but after a long stay in the box, when Luke is forced to eat a huge serving of rice, they come to help him finish it.|$|E
5|$|Mangalorean cuisine {{is largely}} {{influenced}} by South Indian cuisine, with several cuisines being {{unique to the}} diverse communities of the region. Coconut and curry leaves are common ingredients to most Mangalorean curry, as are ginger, garlic <b>and</b> <b>chili.</b> Well-known Mangalorean dishes include Kori Rotti, Neer dosa, Pundi, Patrode, Mangalore Buns, Mangalore bajji, Macaroon etc. Mangalorean Cuisine is also known for Fish and chicken dishes like Bangude Pulimunchi (spicy sour silver-grey mackerels), Boothai Gasi (Sardine Semi-Gravy), Anjal fry, Mangalorean Chicken Sukka, Kori rotti, Chicken Ghee Roast etc. Since Mangalore is a coastal city, fish forms the staple diet of most people. The Konkani Hindu community's specialties include Daali thoy, Bibbe-upkari (cashew based), Val val, Avnas ambe sasam, Kadgi chakko, Paagila podi, and Chane gashi. Mangalorean Catholics' Sanna-Dukra Maas (Sanna—idli fluffed with toddy or yeast; Dukra Maas—Pork), Pork Bafat, Sorpotel and the Mutton Biryani of the Beary Muslims are well-known dishes. Pickles such as Happala, Sandige and Puli munchi are unique to Mangalore. Shendi (toddy), a country liquor prepared from coconut flower sap, is popular. Vegetarian cuisine in Mangalore, also known as Udupi cuisine, is known throughout the state and region.|$|E

5|$|This loss led Tiku to {{reinforce}} his men. The Torajan troops were armed with rifles, spears, boulders, swords, <b>and</b> <b>chili</b> pepper extract, sprayed into enemy {{eyes with a}} device called a tirik lada, or blowgun, to blind them. Tiku himself was armed with a Portuguese rifle, spear, and labo. He wore protective armour, a sepu (crotch guard), and a songkok with protrusions {{in the shape of}} buffalo horns, and carried a decorated shield. With his soldiers, Tiku dug pits filled with bamboo stakes along Dutch supply routes; those who wandered over the pits would fall in and be impaled. However, these were not enough to stop the advancing Dutch. On 17 October 1906, two more fortresses, Bamba Puang and Kotu, fell, after several unsuccessful Dutch attacks since June. As the campaign against Tiku, which had already lasted longer than most other campaigns in the occupation, was thought to undermine Dutch authority in Sulawesi, Governor-General J. B. van Heutsz dispatched Governor of Sulawesi Swart to personally lead the attack.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th century, West European mariners—beginning with Portugal—started making still longer voyages of exploration, using {{improvements}} on translated Islamic star {{charts and}} {{a variation on}} African fishing boats called the caravel. In 1473, Lopes Gonçalves crossed the equator and disproved the Aristotelian notion that a ring of fire would bar exploration of the southern hemisphere. Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1487; in 1498, Vasco da Gama reached Malindi, where a local pilot showed him how to follow the monsoon to India. In 1492, relying on incorrect estimates of the circumference of the Earth, the Genovese Christopher Columbus sailed from Cadiz to the Canaries and thence into the open Atlantic in a Spanish attempt to reach the Orient. Instead, he made landfall on {{an island in the}} Caribbean Sea. The resulting Columbian Exchange introduced potatoes, corn, <b>and</b> <b>chili</b> peppers to the Old World while smallpox epidemics devastated the indigenous peoples of the Americas. This disruption and depopulation permitted rapid Spanish conquests and led to the widespread adoption of African slavery to man lucrative tobacco, sugar, indigo, and cotton plantations. In 1519, Juan Sebastián Elcano completed Magellan's Spanish expedition to sail around the world. These and other voyages permitted European maps to attain a previously impossible degree of accuracy. In 1538, Gerardus Mercator devised a map projection conveniently making constant bearings (rhumb lines) straight. In the Arctic, in 1594, the Dutch captain Willem Barentsz reached Svalbard and the Barents Sea while, in the south, Anthony de la Roché crossed the Antarctic Convergence in 1675 and three separate expeditions—one British, one American, and one Russian—all claimed to have discovered Antarctica in 1820. Not all voyages of discovery originated in Western Europe. Although accurate charting of the coasts of Russia only began in the 18th century and the archipelago of Severnaya Zemlya was not discovered until 1910, Novgorodians had been sailing the White Sea since at least the 13th century. Despite a long-standing preference for autarky, China briefly opened up under the Song and Mongol Yuan dynasties. In the early 15th century, Zheng He's fleet of treasure ships repeatedly sailed from Ming China with 37,000 men aboard 317 ships, reaching as far as the African coast. Chinese exploration, however, was soon curtailed again and finally outlawed. The peoples of East Asia were introduced to the true shape of the other continents from the maps of Matteo Ricci.|$|E

Additionally, their total phenolic contents were analyzed by Folin-Ciocalteau micro method. The result showed that red holy basil <b>and</b> red bird <b>chili</b> seemed to be better sources of antioxidant compounds, followed by green bird <b>chili</b> <b>and</b> red <b>chili</b> spur pepper, white holy basil, green chili spur pepper, garlic and pumpkin, respectively.
