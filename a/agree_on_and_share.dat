40|$|Co-creation of {{integrated}} service solutions in business networks Operating in business networks and increasing service- and knowledge-intensiveness of solutions offerings are prevalent phenomena {{in the business}} world. Prior literature on integrated solutions predominantly concentrates on studies conducted in manufacturing companies and the capital goods industry. However, integration of services and the related capabilities at business network level have attracted sparse attention. Drawing on the in-depth empirical evidence and selected theoretical perspectives of value creation, service management, knowledge management and key account management, this thesis extends and complements prior research on integrated solutions. It identifies organizational and knowledge integration capabilities as the central capabilities in the co-creation {{of integrated}} service solutions in business networks. Activities such as <b>agreeing</b> <b>on</b> network positions <b>and</b> <b>sharing</b> knowledge between network actors are then pivotal to ensuring successful value co-creation and a seamless customer experience. Consequently, this thesis enhances the shift of mindset in solution business from goods-oriented thinking towards strong customer focus and a relational and collaborative nature of value co-creation...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{comparative}} international accounting history approach advocated by Carnegie and Napier (2002), this study compares US and Italian earnings management (EM) literature {{published in the}} second half of the twentieth century and identifies the main similarities and differences in the research topics and methodologies. The historical comparison finds that although Italian and US contributions to EM literature grew in notably different contexts and research settings, they both recognized the issue of EM, <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> its origins <b>and</b> <b>shared</b> some research topics. However, the two bodies of literature differed in respect of the research topics addressed and research methodologies adopted to analyse the EM issue. The discussion of these results provides also initial evidence of areas of potential contribution to the international debate on EM through cross-fertilization. The analysis demonstrates the fundamental role of comparative international accounting history in uncovering the potential contributions of national literatures to the development of accounting research at a genuinely international level. It also contributes to EM literature by bringing to international attention fifty years of Italian EM research that was previously unknown beyond Italian borders...|$|R
5|$|The {{affiliation}} of the Assemblies of God {{with the}} National Association of Evangelicals in 1942 signaled the AG's alignment with evangelicalism and {{its opposition to}} mainline Protestantism and the ecumenical movement. The AG and its evangelical partners <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> most issues <b>and</b> <b>shared</b> similar world views though the AG's Pentecostal distinctives—Spirit baptism and the operation of spiritual gifts—were not embraced by most evangelical Christians. The AG's response then to the charismatic movement {{that began in the}} 1960s was a cautious one, affirming the move of the Holy Spirit yet urging that all revival must be judged by scripture. For the first time, beliefs and practices which had largely remained confined to the classical Pentecostal denominations began to impact mainline Protestant and Roman Catholic churches on a large scale. The fact that this occurred in these churches (which were historically seen by Pentecostals as suspect), the multifaceted nature of the movement owing to the many different traditions its participants came from, and the perception by Pentecostals that the movement was based too much <b>on</b> experience <b>and</b> not <b>on</b> biblical teaching led some in the Assemblies of God to see it in relation to the ecumenical movement.|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{intensification}} {{is required}} to feed the growing and increasingly demanding human population. Intensification is associated with increasing use of resources, applied as efficiently as possible, i. e. with a concurrent increase in both resource use and resource use efficiency. Resource use efficiency has agronomic, environmental, economic, social, trans-generational, and global dimensions. Current industrial agriculture privileges economic resource use efficiency over the other dimensions, claiming that that pathway is necessary to feed the world. Current agronomy {{and the concept of}} sustainable intensification are contested. Sustainable intensification needs to include clarity about principles and practices for priority setting, an all-inclusive and explicit cost-benefit analysis, and subsequent weighing of trade-offs, based on scientifically acceptable, shared norms, thus making agriculture “green” again. Here, we review different forms of intensification, different principles and concepts underlying them, as well as the norms and values that are needed to guide the search for effective forms of sustainable and ecological intensification. We also address innovations in research and education required to create the necessary knowledge base. We argue that sustainable intensification should be considered as a process of enquiry and analysis for navigating and sorting out the issues and concerns in agronomy. Sustainable intensification is about societal negotiation, institutional innovation, justice, and adaptive management. We also make a plea for at least two alternative framings of sustainable intensification: one referring to the need for “de-intensification” in high-input systems to become more sustainable and one referring to the need to increase inputs and thereby yields where there are currently large yield (and often also efficiency) gaps. Society needs an agriculture that demonstrates resilience under future change, an agronomy that can cope with the diversity of trade-offs across different stakeholders, and a sustainability that is perceived as a dynamic process based <b>on</b> <b>agreed</b> values <b>and</b> <b>shared</b> knowledge, insight, <b>and</b> wisdom...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} and analyze the images of China in Swedish travelers’ published accounts – traditional travelogues as well as diaries, diplomatic reports, letters, and geographical handbooks – between 1749 and 1912. The main problem {{of the study is}} the question of continuity and change in these images, which are seen as the result of an encounter between preconceived notions and personal experience. What is the outcome of this constantly ongoing confrontation, as prevailing ideas and expectations in travelers’ minds are challenged by firsthand impressions of a complex Chinese reality? In earlier research, it has often been argued that the essential characteristic of Western images of other cultures has been their ethnocentrism and tendency toward derogatory generalizations about “the other,” including elaborately racist ideas. The point of departure here is a certain degree of skepticism about some of those findings. In my view, there has been a propensity to oversimplify the perceptions of the world held by Westerners in the Early Modern era, resulting in a possibly misleading emphasis on certain image elements at the expense of more ambiguous ideas and attitudes. Examining the sources confirms that even in the relatively small group of authors and texts studied here, the images of China were hardly homogenous except in a very general sense. The Swedish travelers <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> many issues <b>and</b> <b>shared</b> many perceptions, but it was never as simple as their accounts being wholly dominated by certain assumptions and sets of values common to all Westerners. Instead, their images of the “Middle Kingdom” were characterized by ambivalence and contradictions as well as generalizations and stereotypes. Ethnocentrism is invariably present in the writings of the Swedes, and there are occasional instances of fully developed racism as well. Yet, there are also many examples of the opposite: moderation, understanding, and appreciation. Therefore, I argue that we must stress the complexity of the travelers’ response, the tension between continuity and change, the encounter between the “discourse” and the individual...|$|R
30|$|Similar to deliberative {{approaches}} in Technology Assessment (TA), {{which are based}} on deliberative democracy procedural theory, Rawlsian concepts have also found their way to more applied contexts. Especially in the context of applied ethics, the tension between diverging moral frameworks is an urgent problem (e.g., how to sustain the conditions of the good life in a globalizing world (Dower 2004; Hardin 1999), or how to decide on issues related to abortion (Little 1999) or living organ donation (Hilhorst 2005)). Rawlsian approaches seem promising for answering these kinds of questions, since they offer a methodological alternative to the extreme positions of ethical generalism <b>and</b> (specified) principlism <b>on</b> the one hand <b>and</b> particularism <b>on</b> the other (Daniels 1996; St. John 2007; Van den Hoven 1997). 6 Rawlsian justification avoids the drawbacks of both extremes, because it aims at coherence between the abstract theoretic principles and the more particular considered judgments without giving priority to any of them. As such Rawlsian approaches seem to offer a promising decision making procedure within applied ethics. 7 Especially the concept of WRE seems an attractive method for real-life justification. Even without reference to political concepts as overlapping consensus, the notion of WRE can help explain why people consider certain things fair or unfair. Moreover, since the Rawlsian approach takes the different layers of morality explicitly into account, the approach seems to provide a powerful tool for encouraging reflection. The criticism that the Rawlsian procedural approach to justice requires that people share the tradition of liberalism does not seem valid. It is sufficient that people acknowledge that reasonable pluralism is the permanent condition and that the concept of reasonableness replaces that of moral truth. This {{is not the same as}} sharing the comprehensive view of liberalism. In a professional setting where people are motivated to work toward a fair distribution of responsibilities, this demand of “reasonableness” is probably a realistic one. McCarthy (1994) argues that it is a strength of Rawls’ theory that he allows different levels of abstraction. The more difficult it becomes to <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> general interests <b>and</b> <b>shared</b> values, the higher the level of abstraction of the overlapping consensus. However, it could also work the other way around; in case of responsibility distributions, people can disagree on the abstract levels of responsibility conceptions <b>and</b> principles, but <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> particular responsibility ascriptions.|$|R
