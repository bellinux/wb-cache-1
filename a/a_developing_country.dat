5|$|Evaluating Mountfort's works today, one has {{to avoid}} judging them against a {{background}} of similar designs in Europe. In the 1860s, New Zealand was <b>a</b> <b>developing</b> <b>country,</b> where materials and resources freely available in Europe were conspicuous by their absence. When available they were often of inferior quality, as Mountfort discovered with the unseasoned wood in his first disastrous project. His first buildings in his new homeland were often too tall, or steeply pitched, failing to take account of the non-European climate and landscape. However, he soon adapted, and developed his skill in working with crude and unrefined materials.|$|E

40|$|This paper empirically {{estimates}} the trade effects of technical {{barriers to trade}} (TBT) based on all TBT notifications from 105 World Trade Organization (WTO) countries during 1995 - 2008. The paper adopts a modified two-stage gravity model to control for both sample selection bias and firm heterogeneity bias. It was found that a country's TBT notifications decrease other countries' probability of exporting, but increase their export volumes. The result {{can be explained by}} the TBT's differential effects on the fixed and variable cost of export, and consumer confidence. It was further found that (i) <b>a</b> <b>developing</b> <b>country's</b> TBT have significant effects on other developing countries' exports, but no significant effects on the developed countries' exports, (ii) <b>a</b> <b>developed</b> <b>country's</b> TBT have significant effects on the exports from both types of countries, and (iii) exports from <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> are affected by <b>a</b> <b>developed</b> <b>country's</b> TBT more seriously than <b>a</b> <b>developing</b> <b>country's</b> TBT. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

A web movement has begun in the 2000s to provide fair trade items at fair prices to the consumers. One popular one is Fair Trade a Day where a different fair trade item is featured each day.|$|E

One of its main strategies is multidisciplinary research, involving the efforts of medical anthropologists, psychologists, epidemiologists, behavioral pharmacologists, and physicians.|$|E

25|$|More recently, {{democracy}} is criticised for not offering enough political stability. As governments are frequently elected {{on and off}} there tends to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally. Even if a political party maintains power, vociferous, headline grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the popular media are often enough to force sudden, unexpected political change. Frequent policy changes with regard to business and immigration are likely to deter investment and so hinder economic growth. For this reason, many people have put forward the idea that {{democracy is}} undesirable for <b>a</b> <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> in which economic growth and the reduction of poverty are top priorities.|$|E
25|$|The best {{treatment}} for cutaneous leishmaniasis is not known. Treatments {{that work for}} one species of leishmania may not work for another; {{it is recommended that}} advice of a tropical medicine or geographical medicine specialist be sought. Ideally, every effort should be made to establish the species of leishmania by molecular techniques (PCR) prior to starting treatment. In the setting of <b>a</b> <b>developing</b> <b>country,</b> there is often only one species present in a particular locality, so it is usually unnecessary to speciate every infection. Unfortunately, leishmaniasis is an orphan disease in developed nations, and almost all the current treatment options are toxic with significant side effects. The most sound {{treatment for}} cutaneous leishmaniasis thus far is prevention.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of Zimbabwe has grown during the 20th century {{in accordance with}} the model of <b>a</b> <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> with high birth rates and falling death rates, resulting in relatively high population growth rate (around 3% or above in the 1960s and early 1970s). After a spurt in the period 1980-1983 following independence, a decline in birth rates set in. Since 1991, however, there has been a jump in death rates from a low of 10 per 1000 in 1985 to a high of 25 per 1000 in 2002/2003. It has since subsided to just under 22 per 1000 (estimate for 2007) a little below the birth rate of around 27 per 1000.|$|E
