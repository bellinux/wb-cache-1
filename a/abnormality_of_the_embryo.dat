40|$|Certain short-chain {{carboxylic}} acids (SCCA) {{appear to}} share a common teratogenic potential, although the structural requirements for activity remain obscure. By using a whole rat embryo culture model system, several biochemical processes have been examined, either as potential initial sites of teratogenic action or as early steps in the pathway to malformation. Valproate, methoxyacetate, and butyrate were the prototype SCCA examined. Measurement of [14 C]glucose utilization and lactate production confirmed that energy production by <b>the</b> early organogenesis <b>embryo</b> is predominantly from glycolysis. While the positive control agent, iodoacetate, caused a significant inhibition of lactate production, none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SCCA affected this process or glucose utilization at teratogenic concentrations. Valproate did not influence embryonic acetyl CoA levels, {{in marked contrast to}} <b>the</b> reported response <b>of</b> adult liver, <b>the</b> other major target of valproate toxicity. Pinocytosis by the visceral yolk sac (VYS) was measured by <b>the</b> uptake <b>of</b> [125 I]polyvinylpyrrolidone. This process ultimately supplies <b>the</b> <b>embryo</b> with amino-acids and is essential for normal development. SCCA induce morphological <b>abnormalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VYS in <b>embryo</b> culture. Pinocytosis was slightly reduced by valporate, but not the other SCCA. However, comparison with <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> an antiserum, for which inhibition <b>of</b> pinocytosis is <b>the</b> initial teratogenic insult, suggests {{that this is not the}} mechanism for valproate. Incorporation of [3 H]thymidine into embryo or yolk sac was not affected after 3 hr of SCCA exposure, but there was a marked effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> positive control, hydroxyurea. This suggests that DNA synthesis is not directly influenced by SCCA. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

Toxicity was measured as frequencies of: (1) meiotic and mitotic abnormalities in 3 -hour embryos; (2) total development to the 48 -hour straight-hinge larval stage; (3) mortality and abnormality at the 48 -hour larval stage; (4) mean size of larvae at 48 hours; and (5) cytogenetic and cytological abnormalities in 48 -hour larvae. Dose-dependent responses were observed. ^ Most cytogenetic aberrations were <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> <b>abnormalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spindle apparatus, such as anaphase bridges and laggard chromosomes, multipolar spindles, polyploidy, aneuploidy and chromosomally mosaic embryos with different numbers of chromosomes in different embryo sectors. Micronuclei and clumped, pycnotic and deteriorating nuclei were observed in moribund larvae. Overall, naphthalene and aroclor at 100 mg/l had few embryos that survived to the stage {{where they could be}} examined and scored for cytogenetic and cytological abnormality even by 3 -hours post-fertilization. <b>Abnormality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few <b>embryos</b> available for examination was somewhat higher for aroclor but was significantly higher for naphthalene than for control embryos and those exposed to 0. 1 mg/l. ^ At <b>the</b> highest concentration <b>of</b> 100 mg/l, mortality was 100 % by the larval stage for naphthalene and aroclor. Though total development and survival <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> to <b>the</b> larval stage at the 10 mg/l dose were high, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larvae were dead or abnormal in the aroclor-exposed cultures. This mean incidence was significantly higher than for all other groups. Larvae developing in these cultures with 10 mg/l were also significantly smaller and cytological condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larvae was significantly worse. Higher temperature appeared to increase <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> deleterious effects, particularly for naphthalene and aroclor. Results with salinity were more variable. ^ Naphthalene and aroclor were more toxic than benzene. Furthermore, benzene was antagonistic in interactions with naphthalene and with aroclor. Naphthalene was acutely toxic. However, benzene was also toxic, but demonstrated more sublethal than direct effects. The PCB, aroclor, appeared to be both acutely and sublethally toxic at the doses tested. High temperature was synergistic with naphthalene and with aroclor, probably by increasing solubility and uptake. Benzene and naphthalene together in high temperature-high salinity water were more toxic than in low temperature-low salinity water. ^ Overall, results showed that petroleum aromatic hydrocarbons and PCBs can have toxic effects on the development and survival of early life stages of oysters, as well as sublethal effects on growth and cytological condition, depending on dose and interactions with other compounds and with environmental variables.
