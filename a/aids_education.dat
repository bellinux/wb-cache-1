25|$|One of Harvey's major {{tasks as}} Health Minister was {{to deal with}} the government's {{response}} to the growing AIDS crisis. The issue had been essentially ignored under Bjelke-Petersen, but under the more moderate Ahern, Harvey was tasked with taking steps to begin to address the disease. To this extent, she oversaw the legalisation of condom vending machines and needle exchanges, and instituted a program of <b>AIDS</b> <b>education</b> in schools. These steps were seen by some as inadequate, and her role was undermined by her poor relationship with the homosexual community. These issues came to a head in March 1988 when Harvey put out a departmental memo insisting that she be given unrestricted access to the medical records of AIDS patients, sparking a bitter battle over patient confidentiality, and repeated Opposition calls for her to be removed from the portfolio.|$|E
25|$|A major {{obstacle}} to effective global surveillance and control of infectious diseases {{will continue to be}} the quality of national health statistical reporting by many developing countries and lack of followthrough to properly direct aid and to follow recommended health care practices. Those areas of the world most susceptible to infectious disease problems are least able to develop and maintain the sophisticated and costly communications equipment needed for effective disease surveillance and reporting. In addition to the barriers dictated by low levels of development, revealing a disease outbreakmay harm national prestige, commerce, and tourism. For example, nearly every country initially denied or minimized the extent of the HIV/AIDS virus within its borders, and even today, some countries known to have significant rates of HIV infection refuse to cooperate with WHO. Only a few, such as Uganda, Senegal, and Thailand, have launched major preventative efforts, while many WHO members do not even endorse <b>AIDS</b> <b>education</b> in schools. Similarly, some countries deny the existence of cholera within their borders.|$|E
