500|$|As Edward was {{unmarried}} {{and had no}} children, Albert was {{the heir}} presumptive to the throne. Less than a year later, on 11 December 1936, Edward abdicated in order to marry his mistress, Wallis Simpson, who was divorced from her first husband and divorcing her second. Edward had been advised by British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin {{that he could not}} remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands. Edward chose abdication in preference to abandoning his marriage plans. Thus Albert became king, a position he was reluctant to accept. The day before the abdication, he went to London to see his mother, Queen Mary. He wrote in his diary, [...] "When I told her what had happened, I broke down <b>and</b> <b>sobbed</b> like a child." ...|$|E
2500|$|The judges {{had passed}} and Fontan had no second bike. He reached a village and walked {{from house to}} house, {{knocking}} on doors before dawn to ask for one. When a villager obliged, Fontan set off through the Pyrenees with his broken bicycle on his back. Eventually it became too much and he gave up at 6am. He sat by a village fountain at Saint-Gaudens <b>and</b> <b>sobbed.</b> It was the first Tour to be covered by radio and he was found there by Jean Antoine and Alex Virot of L'Intransigeant, who were broadcasting for Radio Cité. The recording of Fontan's sobbing was broadcast {{a little less than}} two hours after it had happened and led Louis Delblat of Les Echos des Sports to write: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 225, when Xiahou Shang became {{critically}} ill, {{he had to}} be {{sent back}} to the Wei imperial capital, Luoyang, from his post in Jing Province. During this time, Cao Pi personally visited him, held his hand <b>and</b> <b>sobbed</b> with grief. Xiahou Shang died shortly after. Cao Pi honoured him with the posthumous title [...] "Marquis Dao" [...] (悼侯) and wrote an official eulogy for him: [...] "(Xiahou) Shang had been a close companion to me since my childhood. He was loyal, sincere and faithful. Although we did not have the same parents, we were as close as brothers. He was like my stomach and heart, and like claws and teeth to me. He was intelligent, perceptive and exceptionally brilliant. It is a pity that his life ended so early. Alas, such is life! I hereby grant him the posthumous appointment of Senior General Who Attacks the South and award him the seal of the Marquis of Changling." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Normal Heart is a play set between 1981 and 1984. It {{addresses}} a writer named Ned Weeks as he nurses his lover, who is dying of an unnamed disease. His doctors are puzzled and frustrated by having no resources to research it. Meanwhile, the unnamed organization Weeks {{is involved in}} is angered by the bad publicity Weeks' activism is generating, and eventually throws him out. Kramer later explained, [...] "I tried to make Ned Weeks as obnoxious as I could... I was trying, somehow and again, to atone for my own behavior." [...] The experience was overwhelmingly emotional for Kramer, as at one time during rehearsals he watched actor Brad Davis hold his dying lover played by D.W. Moffett on stage; Kramer {{went into the bathroom}} <b>and</b> <b>sobbed,</b> only moments later to find Davis holding him. The play is considered a literary landmark. It contended with the AIDS crisis when few would speak of the disease afflicting gay men, including gays themselves; it remains the longest-running play ever staged at the Public Theater, running for a year starting in 1985. It has been produced over 600 times in the U.S., Europe (where it was televised in Poland), Israel, and South Africa. Actors following Davis who portrayed Kramer's alter ego Ned Weeks included Joel Grey, Richard Dreyfuss (in Los Angeles), Martin Sheen (at the Royal Court in London), Tom Hulce and then John Shea in the West End, Raul Esparza in a highly acclaimed 2004 revival at the Public Theater, and most recently Joe Mantello on Broadway at the Golden Theater. Upon seeing the production of The Normal Heart, Naomi Wolf commented, [...] "No one else on the left at that time... ever used the moral framework that is {{so much a part of}} Kramer's voice, and that the right has coopted so skillfully. [...] Conscience, responsibility, calling; truth and lies, clarity of purpose or abandonment of one's moral calling; loyalty and betrayal..." ...|$|E

40|$|Sulfate-reducing {{bacteria}} (SRB) <b>and</b> sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (<b>SOB)</b> {{have been}} studied extensively in marine sediments because of their vital roles in both sulfur and carbon cycles, but the available information regarding the highly diverse SRB <b>and</b> <b>SOB</b> communities is not comprehensive. High-throughput sequencing of functional gene amplicons provides tremendous insight into the structure and functional potential of complex microbial communities. Here, we explored the community structure, diversity, and abundance of SRB <b>and</b> <b>SOB</b> simultaneously through 16 S rRNA, dsrB and soxB gene high-throughput sequencing and quantitative PCR analyses of core samples from the East China Sea. Overall, high-throughput sequencing of the dsrB and soxB genes achieved almost complete coverage (> 99 %) and revealed the high diversity, richness, and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) numbers of the SRB <b>and</b> <b>SOB</b> communities, which suggest {{the existence of an}} active sulfur cycle in the study area. Further analysis demonstrated that rare species make vital contributions to the high richness, diversity, and OTU numbers obtained. Depth-based distributions of the dsrB, soxB, and 16 S rRNA gene abundances indicated that the SRB abundance might be more sensitive to the sedimentary dynamic environment than those of total bacteria <b>and</b> <b>SOB.</b> In addition, the results of unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) clustering analysis and redundancy analysis revealed that environmental parameters, such as depth and dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations, and the sedimentary dynamic environment, which differed between the two sampling stations, can significantly influence the community structures of total bacteria, SRB, <b>and</b> <b>SOB.</b> This study provided further comprehensive information regarding the characteristics of SRB <b>and</b> <b>SOB</b> communities...|$|R
