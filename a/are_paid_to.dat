5|$|Testing the {{validity}} of astrology can be difficult, {{because there is no}} consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict. Most professional astrologers <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> predict the future or describe a person's personality and life, but most horoscopes only make vague untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone.|$|E
5|$|That praises {{are without}} reason lavished on the dead, {{and that the}} honours due only to {{excellence}} <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> antiquity, is a complaint likely to be always continued by those, who, being able to add nothing to truth, hope for eminence from the heresies of paradox; or those, who, being forced by disappointment upon consolatory expedients, are willing to hope from posterity what the present age refuses, and flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy, will be at last bestowed by time. Antiquity, like every other quality that attracts the notice of mankind, has undoubtedly votaries that reverence it, not from reason, but from prejudice. Some seem to admire indiscriminately whatever has been long preserved, without considering that time has sometimes co-operated with chance; all perhaps {{are more willing to}} honour past than present excellence; and the mind contemplates genius through the shades of age, as the eye surveys the sun through artificial opacity. The great contention of criticism is to find the faults of the moderns, and the beauties of the ancients. While an authour is yet living we estimate his powers by his worst performance, and when he is dead we rate them by his best.|$|E
5|$|The CSR {{subsidies}} <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> {{insurance companies}} to reduce copayments and deductibles for a smaller group of ACA enrollees, those earning less than 250% of the federal poverty line (FPL). The second and larger type of subsidy, the premium tax credits designed to reduce the post-subsidy cost of monthly premiums, apply to all enrollees earning less than 400% of the FPL. For scale, during 2017, approximately $7 billion in CSR subsidies will be paid, versus $34 billion for the premium tax credits. A court decision meant that CSR subsidies were treated as discretionary spending, meaning Congress must decide to appropriate funds for them each year. This effectively gave the President the power to end them, as Democrats with a minority in Congress could not appropriate the funds, let alone override his veto of an appropriations bill.|$|E

25|$|Direct {{subsidies}} <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> farmers. This {{was originally}} intended to encourage farmers to choose to grow those crops attracting subsidies and maintain home-grown supplies. Subsidies were generally paid on the area of land growing a particular crop, {{rather than on the}} total amount of crop produced. Reforms implemented from 2005 are phasing out specific subsidies in favour of flat-rate payments based only on the area of land in cultivation, and for adopting environmentally beneficial farming methods. The change is intended to give farmers more freedom to choose for themselves those crops most in demand and reduce the economic incentive to overproduce.|$|E
25|$|As Lyon Court is a {{government}} department, fees paid for granting coats of arms <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> the Treasury. The misuse of arms is a criminal offence in Scotland, and treated as tax evasion. Prosecutions are brought before Lyon Court, Lord Lyon being the sole judge. Appeals from the Lyon Court {{can be made to}} the Court of Session in Edinburgh. There is no appeal if the Lord Lyon refuses to grant a coat of arms, as this is not a judicial function, but an exercise of his ministerial function, although an appeal by way of judicial review may succeed if it can be shown that the Lord Lyon acted unreasonably.|$|E

25|$|In Ireland, Starbucks' {{subsidiary}} Ritea only paid €35,000 in tax between 2005 and 2011 and the subsidiary recorded {{losses in}} every year other than 2011. Ritea {{is owned by}} Netherlands-based Starbucks Coffee Emea. Their French and German subsidiaries make large losses because they are heavily in debt to the Dutch subsidiary, which charges them higher interest rates than the group pays to borrow. Reuters calculated that without paying interest on the loans and royalty fees, the French and German subsidiaries would have paid €3.4 million in tax. The Dutch subsidiary that royalties <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> made a €507,000 profit in 2011 from revenues of €73 million, while the company that roasts coffee made a profit of €2 million in 2011 and paid tax of €870,000.|$|E

Some forces are also conferred the authority to issue traffic summonses (that <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> the Federal Government, not the issuing organization) for offences committed on their area of jurisdiction. While Malaysian auxiliary police officers are empowered to carry firearms, for this purpose they are subject to the same application and approval procedures as any other private company instead of being treated as part of the Royal Malaysian Police.|$|E
25|$|All real {{property}} and personal property {{is subject to}} tax unless specifically exempted by law.

Personal property tax applies to personal property used when conducting business or to other personal property not exempt by law. All property taxes <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> the county treasurer's office where the property is located. Washington does not impose a tax on intangible assets such as bank accounts, stocks or bonds. Neither does the state assess any tax on retirement income earned and received from another state. Washington does not collect inheritance taxes; however, the estate tax is decoupled from the federal estate tax laws, and therefore the state imposes its own estate tax.|$|E

25|$|Some people, {{mostly in}} villages, have {{the belief that}} {{witchcraft}} and black magic are effective. On one hand, people may seek advice from witch doctors for health, financial or marital problems. On the other hand, people, especially women, are accused of witchcraft and attacked, occasionally killed. It {{has been reported that}} mostly widows or divorcees are targeted to rob them of their property. Reportedly, revered village witch-doctors <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> brand specific persons as witches, {{so that they can be}} killed without repercussions. The existing laws have been considered ineffective in curbing the murders. In June 2013, National Commission for Women (NCW) reported that according to National Crime Records Bureau statistics, 768 women had been murdered for allegedly practising witchcraft since 2008, and announced plans for newer laws.|$|E
25|$|Exploding Snap is a wizarding {{card game}} in which the cards spontaneously explode during games. The game is popular with Hogwarts students. In Chamber of Secrets, Harry and Ron are held back from {{investigating}} why spiders were fleeing Hogwarts because Fred and George delayed them with this game. Ron later singed his eyebrows while building a card house with Exploding Snap cards. In Order of the Phoenix, Lee Jordan is punished by Dolores Umbridge for saying that she cannot tell them off for playing this game, {{as one of her}} Educational Decrees states that teachers can only talk to students about the subjects they <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> teach.

25|$|The primary {{beneficiaries}} of the property tax are county boards of education. Property taxes <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> the sheriff {{of each of the}} state's 55 counties. Each county and municipality can impose its own rates of property taxation within the limits set by the West Virginia Constitution. The West Virginia legislature sets the rate of tax of county boards of education. This rate is used by all county boards of education statewide. However, the total tax rate for county boards of education may differ from county to county because of excess levies. The Department of Tax and Revenue supervises and otherwise assists counties and municipalities in their work of assessment and tax rate determination. The total tax rate is a combination of the tax levies from four state taxing authorities: state, county, schools and municipal. This total tax rate varies {{for each of the four}} classes of property, which consists of personal, real and intangible properties. Property is assessed according to its use, location and value as of July 1. All property is reappraised every three years; annual adjustments are made to assessments for property with a change of value. West Virginia does not impose an inheritance tax. Because of the phase-out of the federal estate tax credit, West Virginia's estate tax is not imposed on estates of persons who died on or after January 1, 2005.|$|E
