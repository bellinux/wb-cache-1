40|$|BALB/c mice {{receiving}} <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{before the}} injection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) generated an enhanced anti-HBs response. Mice given <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> in a soluble form induced predominantly IgM anti-HBs, whereas alum-precipitated antiidiotype produced primarily IgG anti-HBs. Injection of <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> alone induced anti-HBs that inhibited a common interspecies anti-HBs idiotype-antiidiotype reaction and recognized the group-specific determinant of HBsAg. These data support {{the view that}} <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> may modulate the immune response to an infectious viral agent...|$|E
40|$|<b>Antiidiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{were raised}} against anti-catecholamine ligand antibodies. The antiidiotype {{response}} {{was shown to}} be cyclical and to correspond {{to the production of}} antibodies that could bind to catecholamine beta-adrenergic receptors and stimulate adenylate cyclase. Disappearance of these antibodies from the serum could be correlated with the appearance of a catecholamine ligand-binding activity corresponding to the synthesis of autologous anti-antiidiotype antibodies directed against the induced antiidiotypic molecules. Comparison of the injected versus the induced anti-ligand antibodies reveals striking differences in affinities but similarities in the ability to bind to the <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> and to the ligand- containing affinity gel. The results support the existence of a functional network of idiotype antiidiotype interactions involving external as well as internal antigens, antibodies, and possibly other types of molecules involved in recognition phenomena, such as hormone receptors...|$|E
40|$|Antiidiotype {{reagents}} that recognize idiotypic determinants {{associated with}} the combining site of monoclonal antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV 2) were used to manipulate the immune response to HSV 2 in BALB/c mice. The injection of <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> into mice before challenge with a 50 % lethal dose of HSV 2 resulted in a shorter survival time than that of mice receiving either preimmune rabbit immunoglobulin G or antiidiotype reagents against hepatitis B surface antigen before HSV 2 challenge. These findings indicate that the immune response to HSV 2 in mice can be modulated through idiotype- antiidiotype networks, thereby increasing the pathogenicity of HSV 2 infections...|$|E
40|$|Antibody {{responses}} to soluble polysaccharides, such as streptococcus A carbohydrate, levan, galactan, and dextran are often of very limited heterogeneity, {{and the capacity}} to produce a given form of these anti-polysaccharide antibodies is frequently determined by genes that map to the Igh-V region of the Igh gene complex (1 - 5). The actual repertoire of antibodies that potentially can be produced in response to immunization with such polysaccharide antigens is, however, very much greater, as revealed by the appearance of new clonotypes in mice previously suppressed by <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> or in mice that have been immunized with polysaccharide-protein complexes or with polysaccharide-containing microorganisms. Relatively {{little is known about the}} genetic or cellular events that determine which of the potential antibodies that an animal is capable of synthesizing in response to a given antigen is actually produced. In this communication, we report a study of the genetic regulation of the isoelectric focusing (IEF) 1 pattern of the IgG antibody produced in response to immunization with a soluble polysaccharide, bacterial levan (BL). BL is a fl-(2 ~ 6) polyfructosa...|$|R
40|$|The network {{hypothesis}} (1) postulates that B and T cells interact via complementary idiotypic structures (2). This assumption {{creates a}} satisfying symmetry in {{the immune system}} by which both compartments would use similar receptor structures encoded by a single pool of variable genes. Experimental support for the sharing of idiotypes between B and T cells has been substantial (3 - 6). Most of this evidence comes from the demonstration that an <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> functionally interacts with T cells or can bind to T cells or T cell factors. These findings, however, do not prove that T cell receptors or factors use the same genes as B cells. On the contrary, the recent failure to detect active gene rearrangements in specific T cell clones (7, 8) indicates that T cells use other than Ig genes (9). One approach to studying T cell receptors is to analyze their specificity and compare it with the specificity of B cells for the same determinant. With respect to the T-B interaction in the immune network, a comparative analysis of how B and T cells recognize idiotypes would {{address the question of}} T cell recepto...|$|R
40|$|The initial B cell {{repertoire}} {{contains a}} considerable proportion of autoreactive specificities. The first major B cell tolerance checkpoint {{is at the}} stage of the immature B cell, where receptor editing is the primary mode of eliminating self-reactivity. The cells that emigrate from the bone marrow have a second tolerance checkpoint in the transitional compartment in the spleen. Although it is known that the second checkpoint is defective in lupus, {{it is not clear whether}} there is any breakdown in central B cell tolerance in the bone marrow. We demonstrate that receptor editing is less efficient in the lupus-prone strain MRL/lpr. In an in vitro system, when receptor-editing signals are given to bone marrow immature B cells by <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> or after in vivo exposure to membrane-bound self-antigen, MRL/lpr 3 - 83 transgenic immature B cells undergo less endogenous rearrangement and up-regulate recombination activating gene messenger RNA to a lesser extent than B 10 transgenic cells. CD 19, along with immunoglobulin M, is down-regulated in the bone marrow upon receptor editing, but the extent of down-regulation is fivefold less in MRL/lpr mice. Less efficient receptor editing could allow some autoreactive cells to escape from the bone marrow in lupus-prone mice, thus predisposing to autoimmunity...|$|R
40|$|Sindbis {{virus has}} a very wide host range, infecting many species of {{mosquitoes}} and other hematophagous insects and infecting many species of higher vertebrates. We have used two approaches to study host cell receptors used by Sindbis virus to enter cells. <b>Antiidiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> to neutralizing antibodies directed against glycoprotein E 2 of the virus identified a 63 -kDa protein as a putative receptor in chicken cells. In a second approach, monoclonal antibodies identified a 67 kDa protein, {{believed to be a}} high affinity laminin receptor, as a putative receptor in mammalian cells and in mosquito cells. We conclude that the virus attains its very wide host range by two mechanisms. In one mechanism, the virus is able to use more than one protein as a receptor. In a second mechanism, the virus utilizes proteins as receptors that are highly conserved across the animal kingdom...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} basis of immunoglobulin idiotypes (1) has been pursued in several well-defined antibody systems (2 - 7). The accumulated results {{have suggested that}} the hypervariable regions (complementarity-determining regions, CDR) 1 of the light and heavy polypeptide chains usually contribute to the formation of idiotypic determinants. In the extensively analyzed murine antidextran model, one private idiotype and one public idiotype (cross-reactive idiotypes, CRI) were assigned, respectively to the third and the second hypervariable regions of the heavy chain (6). In most other cases, idiotypic determinants have not been associated definitively with a specific amino acid sequence (2). The latter result is not surprising, considering that <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> elicited by immunization with intact immunoglobulin often recognize determinants dependent upon a particular quaternary interaction of the light and heavy chains (2). Using carefully absorbed rabbit antisera, Kunkel and colleagues (8) first described the unusual existence of two major CRI (Wa and Po) among huma...|$|E
40|$|Antibodies {{specific}} for the idiotypes of B 10 anti-(T,G) -A-L antibodies (anti-Id) induced in vivo (T,G) -A-L-primed lymphocytes to secrete anti- (T,G) -A-L antibodies {{in vitro}} {{in the absence}} of antigen. Responses to anti-Id were quantitatively and qualitatively similar to responses to antigen. Responses were specific in that: (a) only lymphocytes primed in vivo with (T,G) -A-L (but not other antigens or unprimed cells) were inducible; (b) only anti-Id (but not a variety of control antibodies) induced responses; and (c) only anti-(T,G) -A-L antibodies were secreted. Antigen-primed T lymphocytes mixed with unprimed B plus accessory cells also responded to anti-Id and the phenotype of the responding T cells was Lyt- 1 +, Lyt- 2 -. Supernatants obtained from antigen-primed T cells incubated for 3 d with anti-Id (but not when incubated with controls) provided help to unprimed B plus accessory cells in the presence of anti-Id, thus providing direct evidence for induction of T lymphocyte helper function by anti-Id. In contrast to responses to (T,G) -A-L, responses to anti-Id {{did not appear to be}} regulated by H- 2 -linked Ir genes. The system described is a powerful tool for delineation of the mechanisms whereby <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> affect lymphocyte function...|$|E
40|$|A new {{cross-reactive}} idiotope family (CRIAD 8) {{is described}} that contains subpopulations of antibodies binding to different epitopes. One subpopulation occurs naturally in normal sera from strain A mice, is found mainly on IgG 2 and IgG 3 subclasses, does not bind p- azobenzenearsonate (ABA) +, does not express CRI 5 Ci, {{and can be}} selectively stimulated by low doses of <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibody</b> (AD 8). The second subpopulation is not found in normal serum, binds ABA, is found on all IgG subclasses, expresses CRI 5 Ci, and is selectively stimulated by ABA-conjugated proteins. Since CRIAD 8 was found on both subpopulations of antibody, and since each subpopulation could be selectively expanded, {{it was possible to}} study the effect that expansion of the ABA- CRIAD 8 + set had on subsequent responses elicited by ABA-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) in the ABA+ CRIAD 8 + set. In these experiments, prior immunization with AD 8 restricted the subsequent response of the ABA+ CRIAD 8 + set to ABA-KLH. Furthermore, only those doses of AD 8 that stimulated the ABA-CRIAD 8 + set reduced the responsiveness of the ABA+ CRIAD 8 + set to ABA-KLH, suggesting that the two phenomena are causally related. These findings argue that CRIAD 8 correlates well with a regulatory idiotope and that immune responses by lymphocyte clones that have different antigen-binding specificities can affect one another {{as a result of their}} sharing such an idiotope. These results strongly favor a network organization of the immune system...|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleic acid}} {{sequence}} of the heavy chain variable region (VH) expressed by 38 C 13, a B cell tumor of C 3 H origin, was determined {{by a combination of}} direct (messenger RNA) mRNA sequencing by primer extension and complementary DNA (cDNA) isolation and sequencing in M 13. The VH amino acid sequence was deduced, and hypervariable regions were identified. From an analysis of predicted secondary structure, regions of predicted antigenicity were chosen, and a series of synthetic peptides corresponding to CDR 2 and CDR 3 (complementarity-determining region) were produced. These peptides were coupled to protein carriers and used to immunize syngeneic C 3 H mice. All peptides gave rise to a vigorous antibody response. However, only the CDR 3 peptides induced antibodies that crossreacted with the isolated H chain protein. Only one CDR 3 peptide induced antibody-producing clones, isolated as hybridomas, that reacted with the intact IgM protein. However, the appearance of these clones was a low-frequency event. All antibodies reacting with the H chain or the intact IgM protein were idiotypically specific for 38 C 13. These monoclonal <b>antiidiotype</b> (anti-Id) <b>antibodies,</b> raised against CDR 3 peptides, gave strong reactions in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoblots, but they were of low affinity compared to syngeneic anti-Id raised against the intact IgM protein. Moreover, while the intact IgM was capable of inducing tumor immunity, the CDR peptides were not able to do so...|$|R
40|$|Key words Conventional {{treatment}} of {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) has apparently reached a plateau of effectiveness {{in improving the}} survival of the patients. For that reason the search for new therapeutic strategies in this type of tumor is justified. 1 E 10 is an <b>antiidiotype</b> murine monoclonal <b>antibody</b> (Ab 2 MAb) specific to P 3 Ab 1 MAb, which reacts with NeuGc-containing gangliosides, sulfatides and with antigens expressed in some tumors, including those from the lung. We report the treatment with aluminum hydroxideprecipitated 1 E 10 MAb of 34 stage IIIb and 37 stage IV NSCLC patients. These patients were treated with the anti-idiotype vaccine, after received standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy, in a compassionate-use basis study. Patients received five bi-weekly injections of 1 mg of 1 E 10 /Alum, other 10 doses at 28 -day intervals and later the patients who maintained a good performance status continued to be immunized at this same time interval. No evidence of unexpected or serious adverse effects was reported. The median survival time of the 56 patients who entered the study with partial response o...|$|R
40|$|Feeding {{monoclonal}} IgG 2 a or IgG 1 anti-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) {{antibodies to}} 12 - 16 -day-old neonatal rats caused a profound {{suppression of the}} humoral anti-HRP response in these rats as adults. The hyporesponsiveness to HRP was specific and long-lasting (up to 5 months). It was shown to be dose dependent, requiring relatively large doses of IgG (100 - 600 micrograms) for maximum effect. Secondary IgG (IgG 1, IgG 2 a and IgG 2 b) responses were most depressed. The effect could be reproduced by i. p. injection of antibody. Hyporesponsiveness was not attributable to circulating <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> directed against the monoclonal IgG, nor to the continued presence of the monoclonal anti-HRP since rats receiving antibody at or some weeks after the time of weaning and gut 'closure' responded well to subsequent HRP challenge. The effect was thus dependent on IgG administered over the identical period during which the neonatal circulation is rich in maternal IgG supplied via the milk. A direct function for maternal IgG in moulding the immune repertoire of the offspring, {{as well as providing}} passive protection, is suggested by these results...|$|E
40|$|The {{administration}} of antiidiotypic antibodies {{to an adult}} mouse influences {{the expression of the}} complementary idiotype in a subsequent immune response in a dose-dependent fashion. Nanogram doses enhance, and microgam doses suppress, the appearance of the idiotype-bearing antibodies (for review see 1). In addition, there is evidence indicating that the heavy chain class of the <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> may influence their regulatory function (2 - 5). This evidence, however, is based on experiments involving the use of antibodies that were xenogeneic and/or differed from each other both in specificity and isotype. For a systematic investigation of the class dependency of the regulatory properties ofantiidiotope antibodies, we have isolated spontaneous isotype switch variants from the hybridomas Ac 146 (6) and A 39 - 40 (7) that secrete monoclonal antibodies specific for idiotopes in the variable (V) 1 region of the germlineencoded antibody B 1 - 8 (8 - 10). B 1 - 8 is an antibody derived from the primary immune response of C 57 BL/ 6 mice against the hapten (4 -hydroxy- 3 -nitrophenyl) acetyl (NP), and all idiotopes so far defined on B 1 - 8 monoclonal antiidiotope...|$|E
40|$|The humoral immune {{response}} of BALB/c mice to al [...] -) 3 dextran (DEX) 1 has been well characterized with respect to isotype and idiotype expression. The serum antibody induced in BALB/c mice by DEX consists almost entirely of the IgM and IgGs heavy chain and lambda light chain isotypes (1, 2). The majority of serum antibody that binds DEX possesses a cross-reactive idiotype (IdX) present on both the J 558 and M 104 E myeloma proteins and individual idiotypes (IdI) present on either J 558 or M 104 E (3 - 5). The serum antibody from DEXimmune BALB/c mice had been previously shown to be homogeneous when examined with heterologous <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> and by isoelectric focusing (4, 6). However, more recent amino acid sequence analysis of anti-DEX hybridoma antibodies has shown that {{while the majority of}} these antibodies are closely related, there is a considerable amount of heterogeneity mainly involving differences in only a few VH region amino acid residues (7 - 9). Several mechanisms have been proposed for the generation of this limited amount of sequence diversity including imprecise joining of V-D-J gene segments, use of a larg...|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{development}} of Hybridoma Technology in 1975 by Kohler and Milstein, our vision for antibodies as tools for research for prevention, detection and treatment of diseases, vaccine production, antigenic characterization of pathogens and {{in the study of}} genetic regulation of immune responses and disease susceptibility has been revolutionized. The monoclonal antibodies being directed against single epitopes are homogeneous, highly specific and can be produced in unlimited quantities. In animal disease diagnosis, they are very useful for identification and antigenic characterization of pathogens. Monoclonal antibodies have tremendous applications in the field of diagnostics, therapeutics and targeted drug delivery systems, not only for infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and protozoa but also for cancer, metabolic and hormonal disorders. They are also used in the diagnosis of lymphoid and myeloid malignancies, tissue typing, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, radio immunoassay, serotyping of microorganisms, immunological intervention with passive <b>antibody,</b> <b>antiidiotype</b> inhibition, or magic bullet therapy with cytotoxic agents coupled with anti mouse specific antibody. Recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid technology through genetic engineering has successfully led to the possibility of reconstruction of monoclonal antibodies viz. chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies and complementarily determining region grafted antibodies and their enormous therapeutic use...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Immunotherapeutic {{strategies}} are emerging as novel therapeutic approaches in multiple myeloma, with several mAbs being {{in advanced stages}} of clinical development. Of these, CD 38 targeting antibodies appear very promising. In trials with anti-CD 38 mAb daratumumab, all patients demonstrated panreactivity in red blood cell (RBC) panel testing, complicating the selection of compatible RBCs for transfusion. This review {{provides an overview of}} the interferences and solutions to safely transfuse these patients. RECENT FINDINGS: CD 38 is weakly expressed on human erythrocytes. Since the first reports on the interference, different solutions have been reported, including the neutralization of anti-CD 38 mAbs in plasma by sCD 38 or <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibodies,</b> CD 38 depletion of RBCs using dithiothreitol or cord blood test cells, and transfusion of extensively typed RBCs. SUMMARY: All methods have (dis) advantages, and it depends on the facilities of the immunohematology laboratory what strategy to choose. As the selection of suitable RBC units can be seriously delayed, hospitals should have protocols to communicate this interference with patients, laboratories, and physicians in a timely manner. As CD 38 antibodies may also have a role in the treatment of diseases beyond hematological malignancies, chances are high that health professionals will encounter this issue in the nearby future...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the characterization of}} an experimental immunotherapeutic approach for schistosomiasis utilizing antiidiotypic antibodies. Antiidiotype (31 - 3 B 6) was generated in rabbits using a protective murine monoclonal antibody 31 - 3 B 6 which recognizes a 68, 000 -D molecular mass glycoprotein present in extracts of Schistosomiasis mansoni adult worm homogenetics. Immunization of mice with antiidiotype (31 - 3 B 6) before S. mansoni cercariae infection resulted in protection levels ranging from 16 to 41 % depending on the route of administration of antiidiotypic antibody {{and the use of}} adjuvant. Levels of protection as high as 25 % could be obtained with a single injection of antiidiotype (31 - 3 B 6) without the use of adjuvant. Animals noted to be resistant to infection with S. mansoni cercariae were also noted to exhibit a humoral immune response that bound components of S. mansoni adult worm homogenetics. This induced antiantigen immune response was shown to bind to the surface of S. mansoni schistosoma by indirect immunofluorescence. Further characterization of the induced antiantigen response showed that a portion (3 - 32 %) of the induced humoral immune response portrayed the binding specificities of the murine monoclonal antibody 31 - 3 B 6. The data indicate that <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> generated utilizing defined monoclonal antibodies can act as surrogate antigens in the protection of infection in schistosomiasis...|$|E
40|$|The {{perturbation}} of membrane immunoglobulin (mIg) ' on B lymphocytes {{can have}} diverse effects on B cell physiology. Immature B cells and certain activated B cell populations are particularly susceptible to inhibition (tolerance) after mIg crosslinking (1 - 4), while mature, resting B cells are characteristically stimulated to DNA synthesis (4 - 6). Because both stimulatory and inhibitory signal transduction appear to involve similar early biochemical reactions (1, 6), {{it is of}} some interest that the ligand dose requirements for achieving these distinct functional phenomena have generally been found to differ {{by one or more}} orders of magnitude (3, 7 - 10). This suggests that the ligand binding requisites for triggering B cell tolerance may be significantly different from those for directly triggering B cell clonal expansion. In this report, we have attempted to rigorously evaluate the binding requisites for eliciting the activation, or alternatively, inactivation ofB lymphocyte DNA synthesis through mIg. With the use of a large panel of anti-human IgM mAbs, we examine how the site specificity, the affinity, and the valency of epitopes bound on mIgM affect the capacity for ligand-induced regulation ofDNA synthesis in the appropriately sensitive human B lymphocytes. The data demonstrate that the IgM binding requisites for inducing inhibition ofB cell DNA synthesis significantly differ from those for stimulation. These studies may be revelant to the control of human B cell clonal expansion by <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> and rheumatoid factors. Materials and Method...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} IdX-specific rabbit and {{allogeneic}} <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> (Ab 2) {{was investigated in}} vivo in Igh-Cb mouse strains {{with respect to the}} induction of a cross-reactive idiotype (IdX) -positive anti-alpha (1 - 3) Dextran (Dex) response. These C. B 20 and C 57 Bl/ 6 mice have an allotype-linked incapacity to respond with IdX-positive anti- alpha (1 - 3) Dex antibodies upon conventional immunization with Dex B 1355. 7 d after the rabbit Ab 2 injections, IdX-positive Ig (Ab 3) and IdX-positive anti-alpha (1 - 3) Dex antibodies (Ab 1 ') were detected in the sera of each tested mouse. The affinity-purified Ab 1 ' were idiotypically indistinguishable from reference BALB/c IdX-positive myeloma proteins and BALB/c anti-alpha (1 - 3) Dex antibodies (Ab 1) in a competitive inhibition radioimmunoassay, while Ab 3 Ig appeared idiotypically deficient and did not bind to Dex. The response to the alpha (1 - 6) linkage of Dex was not affected in these mice. A large fraction of the Ab 1 ' and Ab 3 responses of both mouse strains were of the IgG 1 class. The Ab 1 ' antibodies differed from BALB/c Ab 1 by lower relative binding to five of eight tested Dex, and by expressing the Igh 4 b allotype determinants on the IgG 1 antibodies. This study identifies the products of a VHDex gene that appears to be under regulatory control in the Ighb mice.

40|$|In {{this study}} BALB/c B cell {{precursors}} {{responsive to the}} T-independent (TI) type 2 (TI- 2) antigen, dextran B 1355 S (DEX), and the T-dependent (TD) derivative, dextran-Limulus hemocyanin (DEX-Hy) were examined for isotype and idiotope expression using the splenic focus assay. The predominant isotype detected in the TI assay was IgM, while IgA was the predominant isotype expressed in the TD assay. There was also a fourfold {{increase in the number}} of foci secreting more than one isotype in the TD assay vs. the TI assay without an overall change in anti-DEX precursor frequency, suggesting that carrier-primed T cells enhance the expression of non-IgM isotypes possibly by increasing the frequency of isotype switching by individual B cell precursors. A panel of distinct monoclonal <b>antiidiotype</b> <b>antibodies</b> (MAIDs) was then used to examine idiotope expression by antibodies secreted in splenic foci responding to DEX and DEX-Hy. This analysis revealed considerable diversity in the idiotope profiles expressed by all isotypes tested. There appeared to be no differences in idiotope diversity among the various isotypes. A similar diversity of idiotope profiles was obtained from both TI and TD splenic foci, indicating that a comparable degree of diversity was associated with the antibodies generated by TI and TD precursors. Idiotype analysis of IgM-IgA-secreting foci with a panel of monoclonal antiidiotope antibodies revealed slight idiotypic differences between the two isotypes secreted in the same focus in about half the cases. These results suggest that somatic variation occurs during the antigen- driven maturation of B cell precursors, within the 15 -d time frame of the splenic focus assay, and may be associated with isotype switching...|$|E
