40|$|The links of the multi-closed-loop {{deployable}} mechanism {{are generally}} adjusted when being assembled, {{for the purpose}} of making the whole mechanism satisfy the requirements in fully deployed, folded, or the other key configurations. In order to calculate the appropriate <b>adjustment</b> <b>amount,</b> the complex <b>adjustment</b> <b>amount</b> of the whole mechanism is first defined by root mean square. And then, the adjustment model for planar mechanism involving different constraints is constructed according to the different situations. Through linearization of this model, it can be applied to calculate the adjustment sensitivity of this type of mechanisms. Second, with the factor of the practical adjustment in engineering, the three computation modes of adjustment (bidirectional adjustment, invariant adjustment, and unidirectional adjustment) have been developed. Furthermore, the multi-configuration adjustment approach has been proposed to make the assembled mechanism satisfy the requirements in different configurations. At last, all the above approaches in this article have been implemented in the scissor-like element mechanism and two-loop deployable mechanism.

30|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{considering}} the structure and the feature distribution of images, traditional content-oblivious methods have clear drawbacks, e.g., if the aspect ratio is changed greatly, an image will bring obvious distortion by Scaling, and Cropping is likely to throw away much important information distributing over the entire image via cutting pixels from the image periphery only. A sophisticated resizing algorithm {{should be able to}} maintain the salient and interesting regions intact as much as possible. Recently, content-aware methods such as Seam Carving, non-homogeneous warping, and patch transform were proposed, by considering important content, unimportant region, image construction, or texture, to protect both the global visual effect and local structures of the image. Although these methods could be adopted to resize image fairily, there are still some problems needing to be further solved, such as image damage for the large <b>adjustment</b> <b>amount,</b> inefficient iterative or traverse computation, image distance measure and retargeting effect evaluation, etc.|$|E

Secondly, the wind speed estimator is designed, and the control strategy of pitch system is improved to cooperate with the indirect stator flux orientation control technology for rotor-side inverter control. Then by the coordination control of its rotating speed and pitch angle, an operation trajectory controller is established to ensure the islanded operation of DFIG along the optimal transfer trajectory.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{adjustment}} in mean-variance portfolio weights {{to incorporate the}} uncertainty caused by the fact that, in general, one has to use estimated expected returns when determining optimal portfolios.

Applying the adjustment to international portfolios, {{we find that the}} adjustments are nontrivial for G 5 country portfolios and that they are even more important when emerging markets are included. The exclusion of short sales is found to have a further important impact on the adjusted portfolio weights.

40|$|Using {{confidential}} data from US manufacturing firms' tax returns and Inland Revenue Service (IRS) audit adjustments, Mills (1998) tests, and finds support for, her hypothesis that IRS audit adjustments increase as the book-tax differences increase.

Confidential data provide the key variable of interest, Inland Revenue's proposed audit adjustment, which is not available from public sources. These data provide the exact audit <b>adjustment</b> <b>amounts,</b> eliminating measurement errors inherent in proxy variables, and enable a temporal alignment of the book-tax differences with the Inland Revenue audit adjustments, thereby enhancing the internal validity {{of the relation between}} book-tax differences and Inland Revenue audit adjustments. Because the results of our study using New Zealand data, another time period, a more diverse set of firms, and a different institutional environment are consistent with those of Mills, we argue for the generalizability of Mills' hypothesis that proposed audit adjustments are positively related to the excess of book income over taxable income.

40|$|Several years ago, the {{retrospective}} rating plan premium formula was modified {{with the intention}} of eliminating “overlap ” between its insurance charge and excess loss premium components. Under the modified formula, the excess loss premium is reduced via subtraction of an Excess Loss <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Amount</b> (ELAA). Now, the ELAA approach is likely to be supplanted by an alternative methodology, called ICRLL (Insurance Charge Reflecting Loss Limitation), under which the insurance charge is calculated net of overlap and no adjustment is made to the excess loss premium. ICRLL uses the standard system of equations, modified to correctly reflect the loss limit, along with a column shifting procedure to arrive at a better set of insurance charge values to use for solving the equations. The paper starts with an introductory discussion of overlap and a brief review of the literature. After that, the ELAA methodology is described and its vulnerability to inconsistency is explained and demonstrated. The final section of the paper is devoted to an exposition of the ICRLL procedure. As a topic for future research, the author also presents an alternative “variance matching” approach to the selection of insurance charge values. BIOGRAPHY...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: There are {{two phases}} to the polar {{alignment}} problem. First one must quantify the alignment error for each axis. Once alignment error is known the mount must {{be adjusted to}} correct for this error. Often the <b>adjustment</b> <b>amount</b> must be estimated based on {{the magnitude of the}} error. This is primarily {{due to the fact that}} most mount manufacturers do not provide or calibrate the altitude and azimuth axes with high precision scales. This article will show a simple method utilizing a calculated star offset position to make the mount adjustment. The star offset position is calculated based on the known celestial coordinates of a reference star and the alignment error such that pointing the telescope at this coordinate and adjusting the mount to recenter the reference star will bring the mount into close alignment. This method is called “star offset positioning ” and should greatly reduce the amount of time to perform the alignment procedure. Overview In Measuring Polar Axis Alignment Error [1] we discussed various methods to measure the polar alignment error. If the mount were designed with encoders on the altitude and azimuth adjustment axes, or if these were calibrated with an accurate visual scale, the adjustment to th...|$|E

Applying traditional control theory and method is difficult to achieve perfect control effect. We studied the application of the fuzzy control in tubular furnace temperature control. Then according to the dynamic response process of the second order system, fuzzy control rule table is established. The input and output relationship of fuzzy control rule table is introduced applying of synthesis reasoning rules, so as to calculate the fuzzy output vector corresponding to the deviation and the deviation change rate, and then fuzzy judged by using the center of gravity method, finally the <b>adjustment</b> <b>amount</b> of time interval for push rod is obtained.

40|$|Kernel-based estimators such {{as local}} {{polynomial}} estimators in regression discontinuity designs are often evaluated at multiple bandwidths {{as a form}} of sensitivity analysis. However, if in the reported results, a researcher selects the bandwidth based on this analysis, the associated confidence intervals may not have correct coverage, even if the estimator is unbiased. This paper proposes a simple adjustment that gives correct coverage in such situations: replace the normal quantile with a critical value that depends only on the kernel and ratio of the maximum and minimum bandwidths the researcher has entertained. We tabulate these critical values and quantify the loss in coverage for conventional confidence intervals. For a range of relevant cases, a conventional 95 % confidence interval has coverage between 70 % and 90 %, and our <b>adjustment</b> <b>amounts</b> to replacing the conventional critical value 1. 96 with a number between 2. 2 and 2. 8.

40|$|Abstract. Water is {{a limited}} and {{unbalanced}} distributed resource in China, with the per capita amount of water resource there is only about one-fourth of the world's average. However, water is an essential resource for people’s lives and economic development. Over {{the past two decades}} China has seen the fruit of its rapid economic growth, nevertheless, a severe water shortage is behind this prosperous scenario and is becoming worse. Efficient water supply is certainly essential for the sustainable development of human beings. This paper analyzes water efficiency by incorporating water as an input as well as using conventional inputs such as labor employment and capital stock. An index of a water adjustment target ratio (WATR) is established from the production frontier constructed by data envelopment analysis (DEA) including water as an input. The water efficiency of regions is obtained from a total-factor framework with both residential and productive water use. A U-shape relation is discovered between the total-factor water efficiency and per capita real income among areas in China. The central area has the worst water efficiency ranking and the total <b>adjustment</b> <b>amount</b> of water use there is around three-fourth of China’s total.

One of Langley's greatest concerns is with the reconciliation between NEMS and the General Ledger. Langley's accounting system tracks cost data to the penny level. NEMS deals in whole dollar amounts. Therefore, Langley has no way of reconciling the two. The only approach that is acceptable to Langley, unless requirements for reconciliation are changed, is for the NEMS files and the reports {{involved in the process}} be at the penny level. All other NEMS reports can remain whole dollars. Also to reconcile, Langley needs data to show the difference between the previous cost and the new cost for the month. On an input record, the <b>adjustment</b> <b>amount</b> is added to the cost and recorded as total amount. The adjusted cost is not captured. In order to establish a control between the prior months and the current month, a new field needs to be added to capture the adjusted cost (debits And credits).

Production at Langley is run on the second and/or third shift. If a run(s) terminates and/or abends in a particular module, Langley must wait until the next day to resolve NEMS problems after consultation with Headquarters personnel.
