25|$|Why {{does the}} Court not apply this clear law to these clear facts, and conclude, as I do, that the funding scheme {{here is a}} clear {{constitutional}} violation? The answer must be, in part, that the Court fails to confront the evidence {{set out in the}} preceding section. Throughout its opinion, the Court refers uniformly to Wide Awakes Christian viewpoint or its religious perspective, and in distinguishing funding of Wide Awake from the funding of a church, the Court maintains that Wide Awake is not a religious institution, at least in the usual sense. The Court does not quote the magazine's adoption of Saint Paul's exhortation to awaken to the nearness of salvation, or any of its articles enjoining readers to accept Jesus Christ, or the religious verses, or the religious textual analyses, or the suggested prayers. And so, it is easy for the Court to lose sight of what the University students and the Court of Appeals found so obvious, and to blanch the patently <b>and</b> <b>frankly</b> evangelistic character of the magazine by unrevealing allusions to religious points of view.|$|E

500|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{gave the}} song {{four out of}} five stars, commenting that {{although}} she sings through the verses in her [...] "usual speak-sing fashion", the chorus is [...] "joyously irresistible".

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album holds an average score of 55, based on six reviews. Rich Wilson called it [...] "fresh <b>and</b> <b>frankly</b> stunning"; however, {{he warned that}} the album was not immediately gratifying and that it required several listens to fully appreciate. Critics were generally complimentary of Mike Mangini's performance, with Drumhead elaborating, [...] " [...] demonstrates the physical prowess and agility of a racehorse, stretching {{to play at the}} top of his talents and reining himself in to allow his bandmates to do the same." ...|$|E

He dubbed this comeback [...] "Dad's Renaissance". It {{began with a}} hit 1963 revival of Private Lives in London and then New York. Invited to direct Hay Fever with Edith Evans at the National Theatre, he wrote in 1964, [...] "I am thrilled and flattered <b>and</b> <b>frankly</b> a little flabbergasted that the National Theatre should have had the curious perceptiveness to choose a very early play of mine and {{to give it a}} cast that could play the Albanian telephone directory." ...|$|E
500|$|On 24 June 2017 reggae group Toots and the Maytals were slotted for 17:30, with BBC Four {{scheduled}} to show highlights from their set.

[...] The group credited with coining the term [...] "reggae" [...] in song was subsequently rescheduled by the Glastonbury Festival organizers giving Toots and the Maytals the midnight slot, with all other acts being shifted by one hour.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{producers}} kept the film factual, they debated {{how much to}} include. Details on the bureaucracy were removed. Kondracki said, [...] "It was too much information <b>and,</b> <b>frankly,</b> people were bored." [...] Another concern was how much violence against the sex-trafficking victims should be depicted in the film. Kondracki chose to bluntly portray the inhumane treatment of the young women, which she described as accurate representations of what happened. This included a graphic scene, in which Raya is raped with a lead pipe after her escape and recapture. Weisz thought the reality had been toned down, [...] "In real life there were girls doing this as young as 8 years old."

A representative of the singer claimed that Carey had alerted production staff that her in-ear monitors were not working, but that they refused to address the situation, and alleged that they were [...] " [...] her up to fail." [...] Dick Clark Productions denied any wrongdoing, stating that they [...] "had no involvement" [...] in the incident, and that the allegations by Carey's management that they had intentionally sabotaged her performance were [...] "defamatory, outrageous <b>and</b> <b>frankly</b> absurd." ...|$|E

The Teas Nursery business was either {{going to move to}} a new location or be liquidated. In December the Rubenstein family bought the Teas property; the family planned to donate it to the City of Bellaire for community purposes. The Teas property has two historic buildings. Scott Rubenstein, who handled negotiations for the Rubenstein family, described the Teas lot as [...] "the last largely undeveloped tract in the city <b>and,</b> <b>frankly,</b> in the inner loop of the city of Houston where you can do something that can be used by people from all around the city."

500|$|Keith DeCandido for Tor.com {{said that}} second season {{was the one}} on which {{the rest of the}} series was based, with {{characters}} taking long-term roles such as Geordi La Forge as Chief Engineer and Worf at the Tactical station. DeCandido said that the addition of Goldberg as Guinan was [...] "delightful", but that Diana Muldaur as Dr. Pulaski [...] "didn't entirely work as a character". In his view, the episodes during season two were varied in quality. He gave [...] "Q Who" [...] ten out of ten, while he gave [...] "Shades of Grey" [...] a zero. It {{was the first time he}} awarded the top score to an episode; none of the first season had qualified.

The episode has met with mostly positive reviews. In his review of The Simpsons tenth season, James Plath of Dvdtown.com noted [...] "Wild Barts Can't Be Broken" [...] as [...] "pretty decent". Peter Brown of If regards [...] "Lard of the Dance", [...] "", [...] "Wild Barts Can't Be Broken", and [...] "" [...] as [...] "some of the best episodes of the season". The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that the episode was [...] "a curious unmemorable episode with a good chunk in the middle. Neither the opening with The Isotopes nor the finale with the rather dire song help this one at all, <b>and</b> <b>frankly,</b> if it wasn't for the superb parody of Village of the Damned, and the kids' revenge by revealing their family's secrets, it'd sink without trace."

Fast paced and slick, Atwell is still incredibly charming....There is {{a long way to go}} before we see if they can build on the momentum from the previous season, but so far it looks like a fun adventure." [...] Conversely, Kaitlin Thomas at TV.com called the promo [...] "weird", asking, [...] "Why is ABC marketing Agent Carter like it's one of the network's casually daft melodramas instead of a well-written drama...From a tonal and thematic standpoint, the series depicted in that trailer feels like the polar opposite of what it actually is....cutting together a bunch of scenes of Peggy punching people or holding a gun does not make her a badass when its framed in this way, <b>and</b> <b>frankly,</b> it's no wonder people aren't tuning in if that's the type of show they think this is." [...] In March 2016, Maureen Ryan, writing for Variety, described the season's promotion as [...] "lackluster", and blamed it, as well as other factors that included [...] "the botched rollout of Season 2", on the season's ultimately poor viewership.|$|E
500|$|Her family {{donated the}} couple's papers to the University of Toronto archives. The {{correspondence}} covers {{the period from}} 1925 to 1941, the period when the couple were unable to live together. Until 2001, the collection was a closed archive and could only be accessed with family permission. The archive contains nearly one thousand letters and is [...] "one of the largest known collections detailing the experiences of women's same-sex sexuality in early twentieth century North America". The two women did not refer to themselves as lesbian, though they {{were familiar with the}} term. Given the cultural norm of their time which depicted same-sex couples as diseased, they referred to themselves as [...] "devoted women", making the distinction that they were not depraved, but had chosen their partnership. They used their letters to create and define their relationship <b>and</b> <b>frankly</b> discuss not only other same-sex partnerships, but to evaluate what they believed about their attraction. Both dismissed Freud and pseudo-scientific theories which argued for a natural order that governed human actions, instead believing that their attraction was biological and innate, and not influenced by promiscuous living or self-loathing. The collection of letters is an important archive for the historical study of how sexual identity is developed and acknowledged within the contemporary context of an epoch and is a unique collection in that most such archives have not survived.|$|E
