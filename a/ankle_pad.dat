5000|$|The Mega 10-90 came in two versions: The {{retail store}} [...] "street" [...] version and the {{specialty}} store [...] "Pro" [...] version, distinguished {{by the red}} stripe {{down the side of}} the skate boot. The Pro versions were priced at $350-$400 in the early 1990s, and came with a pro level rear quarter package and a thicker tongue. The Pro version was available with either the one-piece ICM holder (lower price option) and carbon steel blade combo or the TUUK holder that provided the option of using V2 stainless blades (highest price option) or standard stainless steel blades. The V2 blades, which were only available for two years in the early 1990s, were about half the thickness of a standard blade and very similar to that used by Olympic speed skaters. At the front or toe end (1-1.5 inches) of the blade, the steel was regular thickness, which the company claimed provided a [...] "kick" [...] when changing direction or starting from a dead stop. Due to high cost (and high selling price) to produce these blades and the poor acceptance at the pro level, they were eventually discontinued.The Micron Mega 10-90 Pro version also had an inner boot with soft lambskin leather and memory-gel <b>ankle</b> <b>padding.</b> The 10-90s were available in a wide range of widths as they catered to the high-end player who wanted an exact fit. They were particularly designed for taller, heavier skaters.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} group III mechanoreceptors to cardiovascular responses in both pre-menopausal woman and post-menopausal woman during passive <b>ankle</b> dorsiflexion (<b>PAD).</b> Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers (10 post-menopausal women and 10 pre-menopausal women) were recruited for this study. Stroke volume (SV), heart rate (HR), cardi-ac output (CO), and total vascular conductances (TVC) were measured continuously throughout the experiment. To stimulate the group III mechanoreceptors, PAD was performed for one minute. Results: The results showed that mean arterial pressure (MAP) mediated by the mechanoreflex activation was significantly increased in both groups. However, this pressor response was significantly higher in post-menopausal women. This reflex significantly increased both SV and CO in pre-menopausal women, while {{there were no differences}} in post-menopausal women. There was no difference in HR in either group. The mechanoreflex significantly decreased TVC in post-menopausal woman, while {{there was no difference in}} pre-menopausal woman. Conclusion: The results indicate that the excessive pressor response mediated by the mechanoreflex occurs due to overactivity of group III mechanorecptors and the mechanism is produced mainly via peripheral vasoconstriction in post...|$|R
40|$|Atherosclerosis is {{a chronic}} slow-developing {{condition}} affecting medium-size and large blood vessels. It {{is the principal}} underlying pathology of coronary heart disease and stroke. In some countries, coronary artery disease (CAD) {{is the cause of}} nearly half (48 %) of the deaths and, loss of productivity life. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is defined as atherosclerosis in peripheral arteries instead of coronary arteries. CAD and PAD have same risk factors and underlying pathophysiological processes. Therefore, patient with CAD should be considered for <b>PAD.</b> <b>Ankle</b> brachial index (ABI), duplex sonography, and some other non-invasive techniques are recommended for PAD diagnosis in patients with the history of CAD.

60|$|To {{return to}} my narrative. A student in a white cap met us and {{introduced}} us to six or eight friends of his who also wore white caps, and while we stood conversing, two strange-looking figures were led in from another room. They were students panoplied for the duel. They were bareheaded; their eyes were protected by iron goggles which projected an inch or more, the leather straps of which bound their ears flat against their heads were wound around and around with thick wrappings which a sword could not cut through; from chin to <b>ankle</b> they were <b>padded</b> thoroughly against injury; their arms were bandaged and rebandaged, layer upon layer, until they looked like solid black logs. These weird apparitions had been handsome youths, clad in fashionable attire, fifteen minutes before, but now they did not resemble any beings one ever sees unless in nightmares. They strode along, with their arms projecting straight out from their bodies; they did not hold them out themselves, but fellow-students walked beside them and gave the needed support.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVEdTranscutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO 2) {{measures}} tissue perfusion and is im-portant in {{the management}} of peripheral artery disease (<b>PAD).</b> <b>Ankle</b> brachial index (ABI) is used for the diagnosis of PAD and represents a predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), even if in diabetes its diagnostic and predictive value seems to be reduced.

40|$|Background—Our aim was {{to assess}} the {{mortality}} and vascular morbidity risk of elderly individuals with asymptomatic versus symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) in the primary care setting. Methods and Results—This prospective cohort study included 6880 representative unselected patients 65 years of age with monitored follow-up over 5 years. According to physician diagnosis, 5392 patients had no PAD, 836 had asymptomatic <b>PAD</b> (<b>ankle</b> brachial index 0. 9 without symptoms), and 593 had symptomatic PAD (lower-extremity peripheral revascularization, amputation as a result of PAD, or intermittent claudication symptoms regardless of ankle brachial index). The risk of symptomatic compared with asymptomatic PAD patients was significantly increased for the composite of all-cause death or severe vascular event (myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, stroke, carotid revascularization, or lower-extremity peripheral vascular events; hazard ratio, 1. 48; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 21 to 1. 80) but not for all-cause death alone (hazard ratio, 1. 13; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 89 to 1. 43), all-cause death/myocardial infarction/stroke (excluding lower-extremity peripheral vascular events and any revascularizations; hazard ratio, 1. 18; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 92 to 1. 52), cardiovascular events alone (hazard ratio, 1. 20; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 89 to 1. 60), or cerebrovascular events alone (hazard ratio, 1. 33; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 80 to 2. 20). Lower ankle brachial index categories were associated with increased risk. PAD was a strong factor for the prediction of the composite end point in an adjusted model.

Possible indices of LBP in rowing are squat jump (SJ), vertical jump (VJ), and passive <b>ankle</b> dorsiflexion (<b>PAD).</b> This study examines the relationship of selected indices of LBPfor male and female rowers with the athlete’s respective coaches’ rating (CR) of rowing performance. Six male and female collegiate rowers(age= 20 ± 2 yrs, height= 73. 9 ± 2. 3 in, weight= 182 ± 23 lbs; and age= 20 ± 1 yrs, height= 67 ± 3 in, weight= 152 ± 25 lbs, respectively) volunteered for the study. Proceedingthe assessment session, a standardized warm up on a cycle-ergometer and low volume/intensity battery of jumps were performed. Order of assessment: SJ, VJ, and right (RDF) and left (LDF) PAD. SJ: hands on hips, achieved/held a parallel squat for 4 second before jumping. VJ: no hold, but permitted to use a countermovement and arm swing. Athletes performed as many jumps as necessary until two successive jumps were no longer higher than the best recorded score. A 30 sec rest was observed between all jump assessments/attempts. All jump assessments were conducted on a contact mat (Just Jump, Probotics, Huntsville, AL). PAD was conducted after jump assessments utilizing a tape measure placed on the floor perpendicular to a wall. With shoes removed, athletes placed the knee of the selected leg against the wall while sliding the heel away from the wall. The distance from the posterior side of the heel to the wall was measured and recorded for both legs, and normalized to the athletes’ height. The difference between PAD scores for {{the right and left}} leg was calculated to assessasymmetry. CR of the athletes’ rowing ability was provided by the athlete’s coach in response to a standardized question whichquantified rowing performance using a 10 pt scale (10 =superior, 1 =inferior). SJ, VJ and PAD scores were correlated with the CR using a Spearman’s rank correlation (ρ). Moderate strength correlations existed between CR and the SJ for both Males (ρ = 0. 62) and Females (ρ= 0. 46), VJ for Males (ρ = 0. 46) and the difference between LDF and RDF PAD for Males (ρ = - 0. 32). SJ is {{an important}} predictor for rowing performance due to the specificity of the SJ to the long eccentric-concentric transition of a rowing stroke. Rowing performance among male rowers might benefit from plyometric training designed increase VJ performance. Improved rowing performance with PAD asymmetryamong male rowers might indicate superior performance developed from rowingon {{the same side of the}} boat for an extended period of time...|$|R
40|$|The {{goals of}} {{management}} {{for children with}} a limb deficiency are limb preservation and length equalization. A guiding principle is to maintain or create a biologic knee, as the energy consumption with a mechanical knee is so much greater than normal. A variety of strategies are employed, {{some of which may}} include amputation. If an amputation is part of the management strategy for a patient with a biologic knee, the etiology greatly influences the specific type of amputation performed. An amputation that preserves the heel <b>pad</b> (<b>ankle</b> disarticulation or Boyd amputation) is the preferred choice and is generally an elective procedure. In contrast, transtibial amputation is usually a salvage procedure performed if it is not possible or not practical to preserve the heel pad as a result of trauma, infection, or nonunion. Jeans et al. investigated how these two amputee populations compare with respect to function and walking. The quantitative (three-dimensional motion analysis) and functional (Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument [PODCI]) assessment tools used in their study are consistent with what most clinicians have observed for years: patients with a below-the-knee amputation walk virtually normally, regardless of the amputation type or residual tibial length. Although some statistically significant differences between the groups were noted, they were clinically unimportant or easily explained by the inherent bias resulting from segregation of the population by diagnosis (i. e., the heel pad preservation group was dominated by patients with a diagnosis of fibular hemimelia with its associated external femoral rotation). In fact, one reason that these differences were statistically significant is that the number of subjects was quite large, which is both a strength an...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is an independent risk factor for falls among older persons. Men and women 55 years old and older participated. Subjects with PAD (n = 86) were identified from a noninva-sive vascular laboratory and a general medicine practice. Randomly selected controls without PAD (n = 82) were identified from the same medicine practice. Subjects were categorized into <b>PAD</b> (<b>ankle</b> brachial index, < 0. 90) or controls (ankle brachial index, 0. 90 to 1. 50). Subjects underwent a comprehensive baseline evaluation for fall risk. Prospective fall data were obtained using monthly mail-in postcards and structured telephone interviews over a mean follow-up of 9. 6 ± 2. 9 months. Two independent investigators blinded to PAD status reviewed each fall incident for its eligibility. A total of 37 subjects (22 %) had at least 1 eligible fall. In an unadjusted Cox regression model, the relative risk of falling was lower among PAD subjects than among controls (relative risk, 0. 54; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 28 to 1. 06). After adjust-ment for age, gender, history of frequent falls in the last year, number of comorbidities, and balance and gait abnormalities, PAD was significantly associated with a lower risk of falling (relative risk, 0. 43; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 21 to 0. 87) as compared with controls. PAD is associated with a lower risk of falling as compared with persons without PAD among older men and women. Future study is needed to determine whether reduced levels of physical activity among patients with PAD account for the lower rate of falling observed here...|$|R

MILLER Human Performance Lab, Department of Exercise of Sport Science, Oklahoma City University, Oklahoma City, OK Category: Undergraduate ABSTRACT Hip {{and ankle}} {{mobility}} are important variables in ball velocity and pitching performance. Possible indices in hip mobility are passivehip internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER). A contributor of ankle mobility is passive <b>ankle</b> dorsi-flexion (<b>PAD).</b> This study examines {{the relationship of}} selected indices in hip and ankle mobility for collegiate baseball pitchers with the athlete’s respective coaches’ rating of pitching performance (CR) and maximum pitched ball velocity (BV). Ten collegiate baseball pitchers (age= 20 ± 2 yrs, height= 72. 5 ± 3. 6 in, weight= 199. 1 ± 35 lbs.) volunteered for this study. Proceeding the assessment session, each athlete performed a series of static stretches. During the assessment session height, weight, IR, ER, and PAD were recorded for each athlete. The day before the assessment session, BV was determined from the average velocity of the fasted three pitches from a bullpen session of 25 fastball readings (BV= 87. 7 ± 4. 6 mph.) utilizing a Stalker Pro radar gun. IR and ER were determined by the participant lying face down on assessment table with the knee flexed to 90 degrees. IR was determined by measuring the degrees of movement with a goniometer when the femur was passively moved into internal rotation and ER when the femur was passively moved into external rotation. PAD was conducted using a tape measure placed on the floor perpendicular to the wall. With shoes removed, athletes placed the knee of the selected leg against the wall while sliding the heel away from the wall. The distance from the posterior side of the heel to the wall was measured and recorded for both legs and normalized to the athletes’ height. CR of the athletes’ pitching performance {{was provided by the}} athlete’s coach in response to a standardized question which quantified pitching performance using a 10 pt scale (10 =superior, 1 =inferior). IR, ER, and PAD scores were correlated with CR using Spearman’s (ρ) rank and with BV using Pearson’s rank (r). Moderate strength correlations existed between CR and non-dominant PAD (ρ= 0. 36) and dominant IR (ρ= 0. 33). Moderate strength correlations also existed between BV and non-dominant PAD (r= 0. 46), dominant IR (r= 0. 50) and non-dominant IR (r= 0. 47). Non-dominant PAD potentially correlates to BV because the increased range of motion in the ankle may create more torque, leading to a greater force coupling {{at the end of the}} pitching delivery. Dominant IR may increase the load on the drive leg which leads to more torque and drive stride for an increase in BV. Non-dominant IR potentially creates more torque and rotational momentum when the front side leg is planted at the completion of a pitch. It appears that the same indices for CR are not as applicable and pitching performance is dependent on various other factors...|$|R
40|$|Information on {{differences}} in platelet function between patients with {{peripheral arterial disease}} (PAD) and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is limited. We sought to examine the {{differences in}} the platelets response to shear stress in patients with PAD compared to those with CAD. Men with symptomatic <b>PAD</b> (<b>ankle</b> brachial index [ABI] 3 ̆c 0. 9; n = 29) were compared with similarly aged men with CAD (post coronary artery bypass grafting; n = 40) but without PAD. All participants were on aspirin, and none were on clopidogrel. We measured changes in shear-induced platelet aggregation (SIPA) and shear-induced P-selectin expression (SIPE) under fluid shear rates of 5000 and 10, 000 s(- 1) which are typically found in arterioles and stenosed arteries, respectively. Aggregation was also induced by a combined stimulation of collagen, fluid shear stress, and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or epinephrine using a platelet function analyzer (PFA- 100) as well as optical aggregometry (arachidonic acid, collagen and epinephrine). Analyses of covariance adjusted for age, aspirin dose, and statin use were used to estimate differences between the groups. Values of SIPA at fluid shear rates of 5000 and 10, 000 s(- 1) were significantly higher in the PAD group, while there were no differences between the PAD and CAD groups in SIPE at both fluid shear rates. However, baseline shear-induced P-selectin expression was higher in patients with PAD than CAD (mean fluorescence intensity [MFI] = 2. 93 +/- 1. 37 vs. 1. 94 +/- 0. 67; p = 0. 01), while the percentage increases in SIPA and SIPE at fluid shear rates of 5000 and 10, 000 s(- 1) were significantly higher in patients with CAD when compared to PAD (p 3 ̆c 0. 001 for all comparisons). Although there were several similarities in platelet function between men with PAD and men with CAD, significant differences in platelet responses to shear stress were observed in men with PAD when compared to those with CAD. Although the mechanism for these observed differences are not clear, we hypothesize that in vivo platelet activation in PAD patients may contribute to the differences and will need to be further investigated...|$|R
