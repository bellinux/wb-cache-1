40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that the effect of age <b>at</b> first <b>birth</b> on mental health for women is curvilinear, with first <b>births</b> <b>at</b> both young (age 20 and younger) and older ages (after age 30) being positively associated with psychological distress. Scholars have theorized that accumulated disadvantages and physical health problems associated with age <b>at</b> first <b>birth</b> explain this pattern, although empirical support for these explanations has varied. Using data from the US National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, this study provides evidence of an alternative explanation for this curvilinear relationship through its focus on: 1) the relationship between deviations from expected age <b>at</b> first <b>birth</b> and women's actual age <b>at</b> first <b>birth,</b> and 2) the effect deviations from expected age <b>at</b> first <b>birth</b> have on mental health. Results indicate that deviating from their expected age <b>at</b> first <b>birth</b> results in higher levels of depressive symptoms for women in midlife who transition into parenthood both earlier and later than expected. These deviations from expected birth timing account for the upward trend in depressive symptoms at older ages of first birth, but explain only a small amount of the higher levels of depressive symptoms at younger ages.

40|$|Abstract Background Objective: To {{compare the}} risk of {{placenta}} previa <b>at</b> second <b>birth</b> among women who had a cesarean section (CS) <b>at</b> first <b>birth</b> with women who delivered vaginally. Methods Retrospective cohort study of 399, 674 women who {{gave birth to a}} singleton first and second baby between April 2000 and February 2009 in England. Multiple logistic regression was used to adjust the estimates for maternal age, ethnicity, deprivation, placenta previa <b>at</b> first <b>birth,</b> inter-birth interval and pregnancy complications. In addition, we conducted a meta-analysis of the reported results in peer-reviewed articles since 1980. Results The rate of placenta previa <b>at</b> second <b>birth</b> for women with vaginal first births was 4. 4 per 1000 births, compared to 8. 7 per 1000 births for women with CS <b>at</b> first <b>birth.</b> After adjustment, CS <b>at</b> first <b>birth</b> remained associated with an increased risk of placenta previa (odds ratio = 1. 60; 95 % CI 1. 44 to 1. 76). In the meta-analysis of 37 previously published studies from 21 countries, the overall pooled random effects odds ratio was 2. 20 (95 % CI 1. 96 - 2. 46). Our results from the current study is consistent with those of the meta-analysis as the pooled odds ratio for the six population-based cohort studies that analyzed second births only was 1. 51 (95 % CI 1. 39 - 1. 65). Conclusions There is an increased risk of placenta previa in the subsequent pregnancy after CS delivery <b>at</b> first <b>birth,</b> but the risk is lower than previously estimated. Given the placenta previa rate in England and the adjusted effect of previous CS, 359 deliveries by CS <b>at</b> first <b>birth</b> would result in one additional case of placenta previa in the next pregnancy. </p...|$|R
