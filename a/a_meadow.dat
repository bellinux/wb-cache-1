5|$|For {{almost two}} decades after its discovery, Psilocybe tampanensis was known only from the type locality, {{southeast}} of Brandon, Florida. In 1996, Guzmán reported finding it in <b>a</b> <b>meadow</b> with sandy soil in a deciduous forest in Pearl River County, Mississippi, a habitat {{similar to that of}} the type location. Due to its scarcity, however, its habitat preferences are not known with certainty. Like all Psilocybe species, it is saprobic.|$|E
5|$|East of {{the house}} there is parkland known as The Park, whilst to the west there is an area known as 'Back Lawn'. To the south-west, near the Home Farm, there is <b>a</b> <b>meadow</b> and to the {{south-east}} there is parkland known as Church Park. The Park is enclosed by woodland, sloped along the valley towards Dawlish, and is used for grazing. Church Park includes exotic trees from the 19th century, {{as well as an}} ornamental pond and waterfall from the same period. In the 20th century, some of the nearby woodland was felled to make glades.|$|E

5|$|Production {{was plagued}} with problems. Bad weather during the {{shooting}} {{was a constant}} source of trouble, and Hitchcock and the crew had an uneasy relationship with the locals. Hitchcock ordered the clearance of snow from <b>a</b> <b>meadow</b> and ordered the local volunteer fire brigade to blast it away, causing the roof of a nearby building to collapse. The mayor demanded compensation of one shilling, but Hitchcock gave the woman who owned the house two shillings to cover the repair work and the inconvenience. Hitchcock offended the locals by refusing to stay at the village inn, and when he was taken ill with altitude sickness, he blamed the sickness on his reaction to the guttural sound of their accents.|$|E
5|$|The thirteenth–fourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann records that, on 30 May 1249, Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson was slain in <b>a</b> <b>meadow</b> {{near the}} Church of the Holy Trinity at Rushen, and later buried at the Church of St Mary at Rushen. The chronicle names one of Rǫgnvaldr's killers as a certain knight named Ívarr, and {{identifies}} {{the others as}} the latter's followers. Immediately following Rǫgnvaldr's death, Haraldr Guðrøðarson makes his first appearance in the chronicle, as it records that he then seized the kingship.|$|E
5|$|The voivodes {{presided over}} the noblemen's general assemblies, which were {{annually}} held at <b>a</b> <b>meadow</b> near Torda (Turda). The Transylvanian noblemen were exempted from taxation in 1324. They were also granted the right to administer justice to the peasants living in their estates in 1342. The prelates acquired the same right in their domains {{in the second half}} of the 14th century. From the early 15th century, the voivodes rarely visited Transylvania, leaving the administration of the counties to their deputies, the vice-voivodes.|$|E

5|$|On 17 March 1924 Bormann {{was sentenced}} {{to a year in}} Elisabethstrasse Prison as an {{accomplice}} to his friend Rudolf Höss in the murder of Walther Kadow. The perpetrators believed Kadow had tipped off the French occupation authorities in the Ruhr District that fellow Freikorps member Albert Leo Schlageter was carrying out sabotage operations against French industries. Schlageter was arrested and was executed on 23 May 1923. On the night of 31 May, Höss, Bormann and several others took Kadow into <b>a</b> <b>meadow</b> out of town, where he was beaten and his throat cut. After one of the perpetrators confessed, police dug up the body and laid charges in July. Bormann was released from prison in February 1925. He joined the Frontbann, a short-lived Nazi Party paramilitary organisation created to replace the Sturmabteilung (SA; storm detachment or assault division), which had been banned {{in the aftermath of the}} failed Munich Putsch. Bormann returned to his job at Mecklenburg and remained there until May 1926, when he moved in with his mother in Oberweimar.|$|E
5|$|The {{animals were}} kept in pens on Sullivan Hill, {{situated}} across the East Drive from the zoo's present location, near the sheep paddock and northeast of the Dairy Farmhouse. Of the original zoological facilities in the park, the Deer Paddock, located near the present Carousel, was converted into <b>a</b> <b>meadow</b> and the deer were moved to the new Menagerie, The Wild Fowl Pond remained, located {{on the east side}} of the park in a low area now forming the northern part of the zoo. The Menagerie continued to accrue animals in the first decades of the 20th century. These were generally donated by prominent individuals and institutions and formed a varied collection of specimens both native to North America and other regions of the world.|$|E
5|$|Europa's tale, {{well known}} in later {{classical}} literature and beyond, appears in a largely familiar form in the Catalogue. She caught Zeus's eye while she and some friends were gathering flowers in <b>a</b> <b>meadow.</b> The god transformed into a bull with breath smelling of saffron, {{in the guise of}} which he abducted Europa, carrying her upon his back to Crete. There she bore Minos, Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon to Zeus, and he gave her a necklace made by Hephaestus that would figure in Theban saga as the Necklace of Harmonia. Sarpedon ruled Lycia, and was apparently granted a lifespan equal to three generations of men by Zeus. His death at Troy and the rain of blood it inspired Zeus to send is briefly described. Minos ruled Crete, succeeding his stepfather Asterion. Poseidon sent up from the sea a bull which had sex with Minos' wife Pasiphae, siring the Minotaur. To Minos she also bore Deucalion, Catreus, Androgeos and Eurygyes, though it is equally possible that these last two names referred to a single son. At least one daughter, Ariadne, was surely present, for the myth of Androgeos–Eurygyes' death in Athens and the subsequent sacrifice of Athenian youths to the Minotaur will presuppose Theseus' expedition to Crete and Ariadne's complicity in slaying the beast.|$|E

In its natural habitat it is rather polyphagous, feeding mainly on bacteria, plants and fungi, and reproduces during the summer.|$|E
25|$|Davis and Potter {{split up}} in 2001, {{just before a}} trip to Patagonia. Davis had been hoping to summit Fitz Roy and ended up finding a partner after she flew down alone and summitted.

25|$|Some {{areas of}} land in Boho are managed under the Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) scheme, with more (ecologically) {{significant}} areas being designated as Areas of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI) or as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC). Farmers receive ESA payments for low-intensity farming, i.e. cutting <b>a</b> <b>meadow</b> after the grass and wild herbs have seeded (ESA scheme). Livestock (cows) were traditionally fed hay in the winter months as far up as the early 1980s, but modern methods of silage has overtaken this practice due to its higher nutritional value.|$|E

25|$|The Bromleys had {{property}} at Sheriffhales, a parish then divided between Shropshire and Staffordshire, and Sir Edward {{had left a}} small sum for the poor of the parish. Lady Margaret settled at Sheriffhales after his death and it became her base {{for the support of}} Puritan ministers. Her presence locally is first noted in the parish register in 1630, when her servant Robert Cowper died. She seems to have taken steps to manage and invest her wealth. In 1636, for example, she leased <b>a</b> <b>meadow</b> at Worfield from a consortium of businessmen: William Whitmore, George Whitmore and John Weld of Willey.|$|E
25|$|In 1812, Napoleon's army made {{an attempt}} {{to blow up the}} convent, but the nuns managed to save the cloister from destruction. In Tolstoy's War and Peace, Pierre was to be {{executed}} under the convent walls. In another novel of his, Anna Karenina, Konstantin Lyovin (a main character) meets his future wife Kitty ice-skating near the monastery walls. Indeed, the Maiden's Field (as <b>a</b> <b>meadow</b> in front of the convent came to be known) was the most popular skating-rink in 19th-century Moscow. Tolstoy himself enjoyed skating here when he lived nearby, in the district of Khamovniki.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the older}} houses in Kew are built round the Green and along {{the eastern side of}} the Kew Road looking towards Kew Gardens. The Green itself is a big {{triangular}} space. It is mentioned in a Parliamentary Survey of Richmond taken in 1649, and is there described as 'a piece of common or uninclosed ground called Kew Green, lying within the Township of Kew, conteyning about 20 acres.' An 18th-century view, taken from <b>a</b> <b>meadow</b> to the east, shows Kew Bridge on the right, a small irregular lake with an island to the left. A road led to the western point of the Green, where the palace was visible, a windmill behind it; and trees, the trunks engirdled by seats, grew opposite the square-built church which stood isolated on the Green. Some land at the end of the Green was enclosed by George IV, and <b>a</b> <b>meadow</b> east of the bridge was made common land, as part of a design, never carried out, of building a new palace at Kew in place of the Dutch House. In the early 19th century Sir Richard Phillips described the Green as 'a triangular area of about 30 acres bounded by dwelling-houses,' and another description of a slightly later date speaks of the 'well-built houses and noble trees' surrounding it.|$|E
