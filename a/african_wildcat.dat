5|$|The felids are {{a rapidly}} {{evolving}} family of mammals that {{share a common}} ancestor only 10–15million years ago and include lions, tigers, cougars and many others. Within this family, domestic cats (Felis catus) {{are part of the}} genus Felis, which is a group of small cats containing about seven species (depending upon classification scheme). Members of the genus are found worldwide and include the jungle cat (Felis chaus) of southeast Asia, European wildcat (F. silvestris silvestris), <b>African</b> <b>wildcat</b> (F. s. lybica), the Chinese mountain cat (F. bieti), and the Arabian sand cat (F. margarita), among others.|$|E
5|$|While the <b>African</b> <b>wildcat</b> is {{the ancestral}} {{subspecies}} from which domestic cats are descended, and wildcats and domestic cats can completely interbreed (being subspecies {{of the same}} species), several intermediate stages occur between domestic pet and pedigree cats {{on one hand and}} entirely wild animals on the other. The semiferal cat, a mostly outdoor cat, is not owned by any one individual, but is generally friendly to people and may be fed by several households. Feral cats are associated with human habitation areas and may be fed by people or forage for food, but are typically wary of human interaction.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, historians {{tended to}} think ancient Egypt {{was the site}} of cat domestication, owing to the clear depictions of house cats in Egyptian {{paintings}} about 3,600 years old. However, in 2004, a Neolithic grave excavated in Shillourokambos, Cyprus, contained the skeletons, laid close to one another, of both a human and a cat. The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, pushing back the earliest known feline–human association significantly. The cat specimen is large and closely resembles the <b>African</b> <b>wildcat,</b> rather than present-day domestic cats. This discovery, combined with genetic studies, suggests cats were probably domesticated in the Middle East, in the Fertile Crescent {{around the time of the}} development of agriculture, and then were brought to Cyprus and Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Its predators {{include all}} larger {{carnivores}} such as leopards, caracals, <b>African</b> <b>wildcats,</b> snakes, and birds of prey.|$|R
50|$|Alley Cat Rescue is {{currently}} the only organization known to have a program specifically aimed at conserving <b>African</b> <b>wildcats</b> and reducing what some refer to as genetic pollution by domestic cats.|$|R
50|$|<b>African</b> <b>wildcats</b> {{are active}} mainly by night {{and search for}} prey. Their hearing is so fine that they can locate prey precisely. They {{approach}} prey by patiently crawling forward and using vegetation to hide. They rarely drink water. They hunt primarily mice, rats, birds, reptiles, and insects.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{thousands}} of years of domestication, there is very little difference between the housecat and its wild ancestor, as its breeding has been more subject to natural selection imposed by its environment, rather than artificial selection by humans. The wildcat subspecies that gave rise to the housecat is most likely the <b>African</b> <b>wildcat,</b> based on genetics, morphology, and behaviour. The <b>African</b> <b>wildcat</b> lacks the sharply defined dorsal stripe present in the European wildcat, a trait which corresponds with the coat patterns found in striped tabbies. Also, like the <b>African</b> <b>wildcat,</b> the housecat's tail is usually thin, rather than thick and bushy like the European wildcat's. In contrast to European wildcats, which are notoriously difficult to tame, hand-reared African wildcats behave almost exactly like domestic tabbies, but are more intolerant of other cats, and almost invariably drive away their siblings, mates, and grown kittens. Further evidence of an African origin for the housecat is present in the African wildcat's growth; like housecat kittens, <b>African</b> <b>wildcat</b> kittens undergo rapid physical development during {{the first two weeks of}} life. In contrast, European wildcat kittens develop much more slowly. The bacula of European domestic cats bear closer resemblance to those of local, rather than African wildcats, thus indicating that crossbreeding between housecats and wildcats of European origin has been extensive.|$|E
25|$|The Southern <b>African</b> <b>wildcat</b> (F. s. cafra) is {{distributed}} in all east and southern African countries. The {{border between the}} two subspecies is estimated {{to occur in the}} area of Tanzania and Mozambique.|$|E
25|$|The wildcat shows a {{high degree}} of {{geographic}} variation. Whereas the Asiatic wildcat is spotted, the <b>African</b> <b>wildcat</b> is faintly striped, has short sandy-gray fur, banded legs, red-backed ears and a tapering tail. The European wildcat is striped, has long fur and a bushy tail with a rounded tip, and is larger than a domestic cat.|$|E
50|$|The African circuit {{continues}} {{to the left}} and the first enclosure is occupied by servals (Leptailurus serval). On both sides of the way we first see the sand cats (Felis margarita), then the <b>African</b> <b>wildcats</b> (Felis silvestris gordoni) and the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor), and finally the caracals (Caracal caracal).|$|R
50|$|Domestication {{occurred}} in the Middle East possibly at more than one location in Egypt and Turkey. <b>African</b> <b>wildcats</b> were traded throughout the region resulting in genetic mixing. Egyptian art depicts the changing role of the cat from field hunter in 1950 BCE to human companion by 1500 BCE. These tamed Egyptian cats {{are thought to be}} the ancestors of domestic cats.|$|R
50|$|Nature and man {{combined}} to obliterate some species in Diawling. Some {{of the larger}} mammals perished due to prolonged drought and excessive hunting. The last remaining lion in Diawling was shot in 1970, and the last sighting of the red-fronted gazelle was in 1991. Today, the only mammals in the park are African golden wolves, warthogs, <b>African</b> <b>wildcats,</b> Cape hares and patas monkeys. Other species like the manatee, crocodile, and hippopotamus disappeared {{with the construction of}} the dam.|$|R
25|$|The <b>African</b> <b>wildcat</b> (F. s. lybica) occurs across {{northern}} Africa, {{around the}} Arabian Peninsula's periphery to the Caspian Sea, encompassing {{a wide range}} of habitats, with the exception of closed tropical forests. It occurs throughout the savannahs of West Africa, from Mauritania on the Atlantic seaboard eastwards to the Horn of Africa (Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Djibouti) and Sudan. In north Africa, it occurs discontinuously from Morocco through Algeria, Tunisia, Libya into Egypt. Small numbers occur in true deserts such as the Sahara, particularly in hilly and mountainous areas, such as the Hoggar.|$|E
25|$|Table Mountain is {{also home}} to porcupines, mongooses, snakes, lizards, tortoises, and a rare endemic species of {{amphibian}} that is only found on Table Mountain, the Table Mountain ghost frog. The last lion in the area was shot circa 1802. Leopards persisted on the mountains until perhaps the 1920s but are now extinct locally. Two smaller, secretive, nocturnal carnivores, the rooikat (caracal) and the vaalboskat (also called the vaalkat or Southern <b>African</b> <b>wildcat)</b> were once common in the mountains and the mountain slopes. The rooikat continues to be seen on rare occasions by mountaineers but the status of the vaalboskat is uncertain. The mountain cliffs are home to several raptors species, apart from the Verreaux's eagle. They include the jackal buzzard, booted eagle (in summer), African harrier-hawk, peregrine falcon and the rock kestrel. In 2014 three pairs of African fish eagles were believed to be breeding on the Peninsula, but they nest in trees generally as far away from human habitation as is possible on the Peninsula. Their number in 2017 is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Kittens {{are born}} blind and helpless, and {{are covered in}} a fuzzy coat. At birth, the kittens weigh 65-163grams, though kittens under 90grams usually do not survive. They are born with pink paw pads, which blacken {{at the age of}} three months, and blue eyes, which turn amber after five months. Their eyes open after 9–12 days, and their incisors erupt after 14–30 days. The kittens' milk teeth are {{replaced}} by their permanent dentition at the age of 160–240 days. The kittens start hunting with their mother at the age of 60 days, and will start moving independently after 140–150 days. Lactation lasts 3–4 months, though the kittens will eat meat as early as 1.5 months of age. Sexual maturity is attained at the age of 300 days. Similarly to the housecat, the physical development of <b>African</b> <b>wildcat</b> kittens over {{the first two weeks of}} their lives is much faster than that of European wildcats. The kittens are largely fully grown by 10 months, though skeletal growth continues for over 18–19 months. The family dissolves after roughly five months, and the kittens disperse to establish their own territories. The species' maximum life span is 21 years, though it usually only lives up to 13–14 years.|$|E
50|$|Southern <b>African</b> <b>wildcats</b> {{are largely}} nocturnal, finding cover {{in which to}} rest during the day. Their habits are solitary, except for mating and raising their young, and they are highly territorial. They are {{adaptable}} predators, preferring to hunt small rodents, but able to change their diet according to seasonal and longer-term prey abundances and availability; they have been observed to take other small mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects and other invertebrates. The largest recorded prey include hares, springhares and birds up {{to the size of}} guineafowl.|$|R
25|$|In 2001, a cow named Bessie {{gave birth}} to a cloned Asian gaur, an {{endangered}} species, but the calf died after two days. In 2003, a banteng was successfully cloned, followed by three <b>African</b> <b>wildcats</b> from a thawed frozen embryo. These successes provided hope that similar techniques (using surrogate mothers of another species) might be used to clone extinct species. Anticipating this possibility, tissue samples from the last bucardo (Pyrenean ibex) were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after it died in 2000. Researchers are also considering cloning endangered species such as the giant panda and cheetah.|$|R
40|$|Apparent total tract {{macronutrient}} digestibility {{was evaluated}} in 4 <b>African</b> <b>wildcats</b> (Felis silvestris tristrami) fed beef or pork-based raw meat diets. Diets were formulated to meet nutrient requirements of cats (NRC, 2006). Cats were fed isocaloric amounts of either control (standard beef raw diet) or pork-based raw diets containing 0, 3, or 5 % added raw pancreas, in four 14 -day periods. Protein digestibility was higher for pork diets compared with beef and inclusion up to 5 % fresh pancreas {{did not increase}} macronutrient digestibility in healthy animals. Raw pork can be fed to exotic felids as {{a viable alternative to}} standard beef-based zoological formulations...|$|R
25|$|The {{large mammals}} {{present in the}} {{ecoregion}} are the addax (Addax nasomaculatus), Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia), dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), and rhim gazelle (Gazella leptoceros). However, rodents are the most represented order of mammals in the Tibesti, and include the Agag gerbil (Gerbillus agag), Balochistan gerbil (Gerbillus nanus), Cairo spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus), lesser Egyptian jerboa (Jaculus jaculus), Libyan jird (Meriones libycus), Mzab gundi (Massoutiera Mzabi) and the North African gerbil (Gerbillus campestris). Also present are cats such as the <b>African</b> <b>wildcat</b> (Felis silvestris lybica) and, more rarely, the caracal (Caracal caracal) and the Sudan cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), {{as well as several}} canine species including the Egyptian wolf (Canis anthus lupaster), fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) and Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii). The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) may also occupy the range. There may be as many as 50 endangered painted hunting dogs (Lycaon pictus) in the Tibesti, although some regard these relict populations as extirpated, partially due to the Darfur refugee turmoil and other Sudan generated conflicts. Bats are heavily represented in the Tibesti, including the desert long-eared bat (Otonycteris hemprichii), greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum), Hamilton's tomb bat (Taphozous hamiltoni), Mauritian tomb bat (Taphozous mauritianus) and the trident bat (Asellia tridens). The Cape hare (Lepus capensis), desert hedgehog (Paraechinus aethiopicus), olive baboon (Papio anubis), rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) and the Saharan striped polecat (Ictonyx libyca) also populate the area.|$|E
500|$|Feral cats {{can live}} in forests, grasslands, tundra, coastal areas, {{agricultural}} land, scrublands, urban areas, and wetlands. Their habitats even include small oceanic islands with no human inhabitants. [...] Further, the close relatives of domestic cats, the <b>African</b> <b>wildcat</b> (Felis silvestris lybica) and the Arabian sand cat (Felis margarita) both inhabit desert environments, and domestic cats still show similar adaptations and behaviors. The cat's ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat has led to its designation {{as one of the}} world's worst invasive species.|$|E
500|$|The coat, sandy, reddish {{brown or}} grey, is uniformly {{coloured}} and lacks spots; melanistic and albino individuals {{have been reported}} from the Indian subcontinent. White cats observed in the coastline tracts of the southern Western Ghats lacked the red eyes typical of true albinos. A 2014 suggested that their colouration {{could be attributed to}} inbreeding. Kittens are striped and spotted, and adults may retain some of the markings. Dark-tipped hairs cover the body, giving the cat a speckled appearance. The belly is generally lighter {{than the rest of the}} body and the throat is pale. The fur is denser on the back compared to the underparts. Two moults can be observed in a year; the coat is rougher and lighter in summer than in winter. The insides of the forelegs show four to five rings; faint markings may be seen on the outside. The black-tipped tail, [...] long, is marked by two to three dark rings on the last third of the length. The pawprints measure about the cat can cover [...] in one step. There is a distinct spinal crest. Because of its long legs, short tail and tuft on the ears, the jungle cat resembles a small lynx. The caracal and the <b>African</b> <b>wildcat</b> have a plain coat as the jungle cat's. The jungle cat is larger and slenderer in comparison to domestic cats.|$|E
50|$|Animals {{commonly}} sighted include springbok (often in abundance), gemsbok (often common), South African giraffe, wildebeest, hartebeest, kudu, black-backed jackal, steenbok, duiker, and {{the accompanying}} predators Transvaal lion, African leopard, South <b>African</b> cheetah, <b>wildcat,</b> and the endangered brown hyena.|$|R
50|$|Many {{authorities}} {{restrict the}} subspecies F. s. silvestris to {{the populations of}} the European mainland. As per the old classification that considered several different subspecies, the small population of Scottish wildcats is F. s. grampia, the Caucasian wildcat (also including wildcats in Turkey) is F. s. caucasica, the possibly extinct Crete wildcat is F. s. cretensis, the Balearic wildcat is F. s. jordansi, and the possibly extinct Corsican wildcat is F. s. reyi. But in 2007, a genetic study suggested that the European wildcat populations, including those in Sicily, Anatolia, and the Caucasus Mountains belong to this subspecies as well; on the other hand, populations in Corsica, Sardinia, Crete, and Cyprus {{turned out to be}} introduced <b>African</b> <b>wildcats.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the larger}} mammal species have been extirpated from Mauritania. Among the antelopes the Scimitar-horned oryx, addax, korrigum and dama gazelle are extinct, the bohor reedbuck, Buffon's kob, Dorcas gazelle and red-fronted gazelle are extinct and the {{bushbuck}} and slender-horned gazelle are of indeterminate status. In the area of Diawling National Park the last lion was shot in 1970 {{and there have been}} no sightings of manatees or hippopotamus in recent years. The Mediterranean monk seal has one of its last strongholds in the world in the coves along the Cap Blanc Peninsula near Nouadhibou. Common extant mammals include fennec fox, golden jackals, warthogs, <b>African</b> <b>wildcats,</b> Cape hares and patas monkeys.|$|R
5000|$|Based on a {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{study of}} 979 domestic and wildcats from Europe, Asia, and Africa, the <b>African</b> <b>wildcat</b> {{is thought to}} have split off from the European wildcat about 173,000 years ago, and from the Asiatic wildcat and the Southern <b>African</b> <b>wildcat</b> F. s. cafra about 131,000 years ago. About 10,000 years ago, some individual African wildcats were tamed in the Middle East and are the ancestors of the domestic cat.

40|$|Feline tooth {{resorption}} {{has been}} widely reported in domestic cats and sporadically described in other felidae. The goal {{of the present study}} was to determine the prevalence of tooth resorption and to report other dental problems in a population of wild felidae. Observations of dental disorders and anomalies were made in skulls from 73 wild felidae (cheetahs, leopards, caracals, <b>African</b> <b>wildcats,</b> and lions) originating from Namibia. In addition, radiographs were taken in 43 cases to determine signs of bone and root pathology. Radiographs showed varying stages of tooth resorption in 16. 0 % of the specimens. Other dental anomalies found included fused teeth, supernumerary roots, or missing teeth. The prevalence of dental resorption in wild felidae was lower than reported in the domestic cat...|$|R
50|$|Lesser {{flamingos}} are prey to {{a variety}} of species, including marabou storks, baboons, <b>African</b> fish eagles, <b>wildcats,</b> and <b>African</b> golden wolves.|$|R
50|$|Rodents and shrews {{may enter}} the diet of {{juvenile}} crocodiles, i.e. 1 to 1.5 m, and become commonplace in sub-adult and small adult crocodiles. Species recorded include the Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis), African marsh rat (Dasymys incomtus), common rufous-nosed rat (Oenomys hypoxanthus) and the savanna swamp shrew (Crocidura longipes). In many areas, the cane rats are a particular favorite mammalian food for crocodiles, particularly the relatively large greater cane rat (Thryonomys swinderianus). In Uganda and Zambia, the latter species {{are the leading}} overall mammalian prey type for crocodiles and one Kenyan crocodile of 2.7 m in length had 40 greater cane rats in its stomach. Cape porcupines (Hystrix africaeaustralis) {{are known to have}} been preyed on several times in Kruger National Park, their quills apparently being an insufficient defense against the tough jaws and digestive system of crocodiles. Small carnivores are readily taken opportunistically including both African clawless (Aonyx capensis) and spotted-necked otters (Hydrictis maculicollis), as well as water mongoose (Atilax paludinosus), <b>African</b> <b>wildcats</b> (Felis silvestris lybica) and servals (Leptailurus serval).|$|R

50|$|Fauna in {{the reserve}} {{includes}} waterbuck, kudu, bush buck, mountain reedbuck, blue wildebeest, zebra, giraffe and warthog. Less common sightings include leopard, Southern <b>African</b> <b>wildcat,</b> aardvark and hedgehog.|$|E
5000|$|Although exact {{dates and}} methods of {{persistence}} hunting are difficult to study, several recent accounts of persistence hunting have been recorded. Tribes in the Kalahari Desert in Botswana {{have been known to}} employ endurance running to scavenge and hunt prey. In the open country, the !Xo and /Gwi tribes run down slow-moving animals such as aardvark and porcupines, while during the hotter part of the day, they target animals such as eland, kudu, gemsbok, hartebeest, duiker, steenbok, cheetah, caracal, and <b>African</b> <b>wildcats.</b> In addition to these existing African tribes, {{it has been suggested that}} the Tarahumara people in Mexico and the Paiute people and Navajo in the American Southwest, used persistence hunting to capture prey including deer and pronghorn. The Aborigines in Australia are known to have hunted kangaroo in similar ways. [...] Due to the increased availability of weapons, nutrition, tracking devices, and motor vehicles, one may argue that persistence hunting is no longer an effective method of hunting animals for food. However, there are examples of the practice occurring in modern times: the !Xo and /Gwi in the central Kalahari, still practice persistence hunting and have developed advanced methods of doing so. Similarly, the Russian Lykov family that lived in isolation for 40 years also used persistence hunting due to a lack of weapons.|$|R
500|$|Springbok {{often go}} into bouts of {{repeated}} high leaps {{of up to}} [...] into the air – a practice known as pronking (derived from the Afrikaans pronk, [...] "to show off") or stotting. In pronking, the springbok performs multiple leaps into the air in a stiff-legged posture, with the back bowed and the white flap lifted. When the male shows off his strength to attract a mate, or to ward off predators, he starts off in a stiff-legged trot, leaping into the air with an arched back every few paces and lifting the flap along his back. Lifting the flap causes the long white hairs under the tail to stand up in a conspicuous fan shape, which in turn emits a strong scent of sweat. Although the exact cause of this behaviour is unknown, springbok exhibit this activity when they are nervous or otherwise excited. The most accepted theory for pronking {{is that it is}} a method to raise alarm against a potential predator or confuse it, or to get a better view of a concealed predator; it may also be used for display. Springbok are very fast antelopes, clocked at [...] They generally tend to be ignored by carnivores unless they are breeding. Caracals, cheetahs, leopards, spotted hyaenas, and wild dogs are major predators of the springbok. Southern <b>African</b> <b>wildcats,</b> black-backed jackals, black eagles, martial eagles, and tawny eagles target juveniles. Springbok are generally quiet animals, though they may make occasional low-pitched bellows as a greeting and high-pitched snorts when alarmed.|$|R
40|$|The {{domestic}} or house cat Felis catus (Carnivora: Felidae) {{is usually}} {{believed to be}} derived from the <b>African</b> or Arabian <b>wildcat</b> Felis sylvestris lybica (Randi and Ragni 1991, Bradshaw 1992). Circumstantial evidence suggests that domestication began about 8000 BP in the eastern Mediterranean (Zeuner 1958, le Brunet al. 1987) and continued until 4000 BP in the Middle East and perhaps also in the valley of the Indus (Baldwin 1975, Ahmad et al. 1980). Paintings and sculptures of cats from the Eighteenth Dynasty confirm that cats were fully domesticated and living in close association with humans in Egypt by 3600 BP (Clutton-Brock 1981, Serpell 1988). Domestic cats spread slowly from Egypt, but occupied much of Europe prior to the spread of the Roman Empire (Waldren et al. 1984, Kitchener 1991). In the last 2000 years domestic cats have been transported actively on sailing vessels to most parts of the world (Lumpkin 1993), either for food, their ability to control ship-borne rodents or as pets (Dickman 1995) ...|$|R
