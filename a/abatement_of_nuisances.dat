For 1992, the results of the inventory calculations are in good agreement, with total fuel used by aviation calculated to be 129. 3 Tg (DLR), 131. 2 Tg (ANCAT), and 139. 4 Tg (NASA). Total emissions of NOx (as N 02) in 1992 were calculated to range from 1. 7 Tg (NASA) to 1. 8 Tg (ANCAT and DLR). Forecasts of air travel demand and technology developed by NASA and ANCAT for 2015 have been used to create three-dimensional (3 -D) data sets of fuel burn and NOx emissions for purposes of modeling the near-term effects of aircraft. The NASA 2015 forecast results in a global fuel burn of 309 Tg, with a NOx emission of 4. 1 Tg (as N 02); the global emission index, EI(NOx) (g NOx/kg fuel), is 13. 4. In contrast, the ANCAT 2015 forecast results in lower values-a global fuel burn of 287 Tg, an emission of 3. 5 Tg of NOx and a global emission index of 12. 3.

40|$|When economists {{speak of}} an {{underlying}} legal structure that imposes an 2 ̆ 2 absolute permission 2 ̆ 2 requirement on access to, and use of, knowledge goods protected by {{intellectual property rights}} (IPRs), they typically have in mind the domestic patent and copyright laws. Under these and related intellectual property regimes, one cannot normally make use of a protected invention or creative work of authorship for specified purposes and for limited periods of time without prior authorization of the rights holder, typically {{in the form of}} a license. When economists speak of liability rules, in contrast, they envision an underlying legal structure that permits third parties to undertake certain actions without prior permission, provided that they compensate injured parties for all or part of the costs they inflict. While typical examples are found in tort laws regulating the <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuisances,</b> liability rules also abound in the realm of intellectual property law, where, however, their function has largely been overlooked or mischaracterized by legal and economic scholars. In this context, liability rules conjure up a regime built on a 2 ̆ 2 take and pay 2 ̆ 2 principle. Under such a regime, second comers can access and use the protected subject matter for specified purposes without permission, but they must compensate the first comer for these uses in one manner or another. This chapter discusses new forms of liability rules that might profitably be used to stimulate local innovation in developing countries. Our thesis is that a properly designed liability rule to protect small-scale innovation in developing countries would overcome investors 2 ̆ 7 fears of market failure with fewer social costs than would accrue either under a regime of unbridled copying or under a regime of hybrid exclusive property rights, such as those embodied in laws that protect utility models, industrial designs, plant varieties, or miscellaneous other subject matters in developed countries.

40|$|Local {{government}} in South Carolina consists of general purpose governments {{as well as}} special purpose governments. The 46 counties and 269 municipalities comprise the general purpose governments. These local governments are political subdivisions of the State as they find {{the basis of their}} authority and governance structure in the State Constitution and in the Code of Law of South Carolina. The most notable piece of legislation defining their structure and authority is the Home Rule Act of 1975. (A brief history of how this act came to fruition is included in the section of this report entitled “Counties in South Carolina. ”) Both counties and cities in South Carolina have been granted the authority to exercise broad “police powers. ” Municipalities have had this authority for some time and counties were given a clear grant of general police powers in 1989 with passage of Act 139 of 1989. (Sec. 4 - 9 - 25) These powers allow them to legislate for the purpose of regulating public health, safety, welfare, morals and <b>abatements</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuisances,</b> so long as such regulations do not contradict constitutional and statutory rights of citizens and general state law.

Barrett Prettyman, the D.C. Circuit judge who wrote the opinion, found no problem with the government using eminent domain to clear blighted structures because it could be seen as the <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> a public <b>nuisance.</b> However, Judge Prettyman saw the land on which the blighted structures were located as a different matter and as having nothing inherently to do with blight.

40|$|At {{the heart}} of the body of {{environmental}} controls available to local councils lies the concept <b>of</b> statutory <b>nuisance</b> under Part III of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 ('the Act'). Local councils have a duty to investigate their areas from time to time seeking for the existence <b>of</b> statutory <b>nuisances.</b> In reality, the use of their powers is usually triggered by a complaint and, indeed, the Act specifically empowers them to follow up such complaints where it is reasonably practicable that they should do so. As is well known, the prime weapon is the abatement notice which must be served where the officers have formed the view that a statutory nuisance exists. An appeal to the magistrates' court lies within 21 days of the service of this notice. The effect of an appeal is normally to suspend the notice until the appeal has been heard. In the event that no appeal is made and yet the notice is not complied with, the local authority have a discretion to prosecute. It can be seen that these procedures mix administrative law with civil and criminal outcomes. The service of a notice is an administrative act and an appeal against it would be civil in nature, whereas a prosecution for failure to comply with a notice would be criminal in nature. But, both sets of proceedings take place in the magistrates' court with the potential for confusion in terms of the rules of evidence and the procedures that each entail. What should be a relatively straightforward procedure has become one where the complexities of the law and the variations from one case to another mean that drafting a watertight abatement notice has become an unrealised ambition by many an officer. It might not be an exaggeration to suggest that most abatement notices have become appealable on such grounds as these. If the interpretation of the requirements of section 80 (1) means that officers could simply serve notices which required an <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nuisance</b> without specifying the manner <b>of</b> the <b>abatement,</b> then the problem might be resolved. A number of Divisional Court cases have considered this issue but without any satisfactory resolution. Some of these have now gone to the Court of Appeal and the latest of these has attempted to cut through this Gordian knot by taking this route to the interpretation of the statute...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the chemistry and biology of the River Godavari in relation t o pollution by the effluents of the paper mills at Rajamundry is reported. A description is given of the pollution situation, and an account is given of the biota under natural and polluted conditions res-pectively. Suggestions have been made for the <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> this pollution <b>nuisance.</b> I n all industrialised countries of America and Europe, it is not lawful to deposit in or allow to pass into water resources of the State any extraneous matter or any residuary solid or $liquid from any refinery, tannery, distillery, chem~cal works, paper. mills {{and other types of}} factories, which will be deleterious to fish or plant life. In India, which is fast progressing industrially, many manufacturing undertakings are started near dams, hydro-electric reservoirs and rivers where power and water are available. Factory refuse is allowed to accumulate close to such industrial concerns and to pollute the nearby water resources. As industries and popu-lation continue to grow, pollution of water resources by factory wastes becomes an ever-present problem requiring continuous and vigorous attention in view of the need for the conservation of all existing food supplies and the preservation of fish life and other material resources {{for the benefit of the}} pre-sent and future generations. In India, Hora (1942) was perhaps the first to draw attention to this seriops problem from the fisheries aspect; and Hora and Nair (1 944) made a scientific study of the effluents of the Quinine Fac-tory at Mungapoo in Darjeeling, Bengal, from this point of view.

The presence <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> parameters causes biases in key estimates used in the tests. So inferences made on the presence <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> parameters may lead to less accurate conclusions. Even the presence <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> parameters can destroy the test. Thus in eliminating the influence <b>of</b> <b>nuisance</b> parameters from the test can improve the tests' performance.
