25|$|An {{instantaneous}} evaluation about {{intentions of}} an approaching person or subject based upon visual clues might have very strong connection with initial stages of biological evolution. The reason why it happens so quickly inside our brains {{has to do with}} both risks and benefits subjected with any person or subject that is being encountered at very first time. The latency time of an entire evaluation process suggests a crucial adaption done by pre-historic creatures based upon their earlier experiences of encounters with strangers. Lesser time the process of identification takes, better <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> of survival.|$|E

2500|$|The BJP politicians, as well {{as those}} of other parties, argue that {{demographics}} play an essential role in Indian elections. The BJP believe that the higher the number of Muslims within a constituency, the higher <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> of centrist parties [...] to acquiesce to minority groups' requests, which lowers the chances of Muslims [...] "building bridges" [...] with their Hindu neighbours. [...] As such, according to this argument [...] "Muslim appeasement" [...] is the root cause of communal violence. Susanne and Lloyd Rudolph argue that the economic disparity is a reason for the aggression shown towards Muslims by Hindus. As India's economy expanded due to globalization and investment from overseas companies, the expectations of the Hindu population were not matched by the opportunities. Hindu nationalists then encouraged the perception of Muslims as the source of the Hindus' troubles.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{thoughts}} and attempts I made to practice [...] were suggested by a question which {{occurred to me}} in 1946 as I was convalescing from an illness and playing solitaires. The question was what <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> that a Canfield solitaire laid out with 52 cards will come out successfully? After {{spending a lot of}} time trying to estimate them by pure combinatorial calculations, I wondered whether a more practical method than [...] "abstract thinking" [...] might not be to lay it out say one hundred times and simply observe and count the number of successful plays. This was already possible to envisage with the beginning of the new era of fast computers, and I immediately thought of problems of neutron diffusion and other questions of mathematical physics, and more generally how to change processes described by certain differential equations into an equivalent form interpretable as a succession of random operations. Later , I described the idea to John von Neumann, and we began to plan actual calculations.|$|E

60|$|Countless and inestimable <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> of war. Those {{who read}} the story, and still more those who share the dangers, of a {{campaign}} feel that every incident is surrounded {{with a host of}} possibilities, any one of which, had it become real, would have changed the whole course of events. The influence of Fortune is powerfully and continually exerted. In the flickering light of conflict the outlines of solid fact throw on every side the vague shadows of possibility. We {{live in a world of}} 'ifs.' 'What happened,' is singular; 'what might have happened,' legion. But to try to gauge the influence of this uncertain force were utterly futile, and it is perhaps wise, and indisputably convenient, to assume that the favourable and adverse chances equate, and then eliminate them both from the calculation.|$|E
60|$|All such {{forecasting}} is {{the very}} wildest of shooting. There <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> of war to put one out, and of a war that changes far faster than the military intelligence. I have made various forecasts. At the outset I thought that military Germany would fight at about the 1899 level, would be lavish with cavalry and great attacks, {{that it would be}} reluctant to entrench, and that the French and British had learnt the lesson of the Boer war better than the Germans. I trusted to the melodramatic instinct of the Kaiser. I trusted to the quickened intelligence of the British military caste. The first rush seemed to bear me out, and I opened my paper day by day expecting to read of the British and French entrenched and the Germans beating themselves to death against wire and trenches. In those days I wrote of the French being over the Rhine before 1915. But it was the Germans who entrenched first.|$|E
60|$|They {{spend their}} honeymoon in Rome, and on page 211 of Vol. I. we find poor Dorothea “alone in her apartments, sobbing bitterly, {{with such an}} {{abandonment}} to this relief of an oppressed heart as a woman habitually controlled by pride will sometimes allow herself when she feels securely alone.” What was she crying about? “She thought her feeling of desolation was the fault of her own spiritual poverty.” A characteristic George Eliot probe. Why does not Dorothea give {{the real reason for}} her desolateness? Because she does not know what the real reason is—conscience makes blunderers of us all. “How was it that in the weeks since their marriage Dorothea had not distinctly observed, but felt, with a stifling depression, that the large vistas and wide fresh air which she had dreamed of finding in her husband’s mind were replaced by anterooms and winding passages which seemed to lead no whither? I suppose it was because in courtship everything is regarded as provisional and preliminary, and the smallest sample of virtue or accomplishment is taken to guarantee delightful stores which the broad leisure of marriage will reveal. But, the door-sill of marriage once crossed, expectation is concentrated on the present. Having once embarked on your marital voyage, you may become aware that you make no way, and that the sea is not within sight—that in fact you are exploring an inclosed basin.” So the ungauged reservoir turns out to be an inclosed basin, but Dorothea was prevented by her social lot, and perverse goodness, and puritanical “reversion,” from foreseeing that. She might have been saved from her gloomy marital voyage “if she could have fed her affection with those childlike caresses which are the bent of every sweet woman who has begun by showering kisses on the hard pate of her bald doll, creating a happy soul within that woodenness from the wealth of her own love.” Then, perhaps, Ladislaw would have been her first husband instead of her second, as he certainly was her first and only love. Such <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> and mischances in the lottery of matrimony.|$|E
