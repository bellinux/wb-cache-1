Recently we reported {{the discovery of}} four independent families with deep intronic mutations in the main inherited optic neuropathies gene OPA 1. These deep intronic mutations cause mis-splicing of the OPA 1 pre-messenger-RNA transcripts by creating cryptic <b>acceptor</b> <b>splice</b> <b>sites.</b> As a rescue strategy we sought to prevent mis-splicing of the mutant pre-messenger-RNA by applying 2 ′O-methyl-antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) with a full-length phosphorothioate backbone that target the cryptic <b>acceptor</b> <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> and the predicted novel branch point created by the deep intronic mutations, respectively. Transfection of patient-derived primary fibroblasts with these AONs induced correct splicing of the mutant pre-messenger-RNA in a time and concentration dependent mode of action, as detected by pyrosequencing of informative heterozygous variants. The treatment showed strong rescue effects (≃ 55 %) using the cryptic <b>acceptor</b> <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> targeting AON and moderate rescue (≃ 16 %) using the branch point targeting AON. The highest efficacy of Splice correction could be observed 4 days after treatment however, significant effects were still seen 14 days post-transfection. Western blot analysis revealed increased amounts of OPA 1 protein with maximum amounts at ≃ 3 days post-treatment. In summary, we provide the first mutation-specific in vitro rescue strategy for OPA 1 deficiency using synthetic AONs...|$|R
40|$|Background Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is an X-linked recessive muscle wasting disorder characterised {{by the absence}} of the protein dystrophin. Antisense oligonucleotides have been used to re-direct dystrophin pre-mRNA processing by blocking sequences crucial to pre-mRNA splicing, thereby inducing skipping of specific exons. We wished to determine which splicing motifs are most amenable as targets for antisense oligonucleotide induction of efficient and specific skipping of selected exons. Methods Antisense oligonucleotides were directed at regions of dystrophin exon 19 involved in pre-mRNA splicing, including the donor and <b>acceptor</b> <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> and the exon splicing enhancer (ESE). Cultured myotubes were transfected with antisense oligonucleotides at various concentrations and studies undertaken to determine both specificity and efficiency of induced exon 19 skipping. Results Antisense oligonucleotides as small as 12 nucleotides targeting the ESE induced consistent and specific skipping of only exon 19 in both human and normal and mdx mouse myotubes. Antisense oligonucleotides directed at the donor and <b>acceptor</b> <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> also induced specific exon 19 skipping while mismatched antisense oligonucleotides could only induce skipping when delivered at higher concentrations. No other dystrophin exons were removed from the mature mRNA as a consequence of these antisense oligonucleotides treatments. Conclusions Antisense oligonucleotides directed at the ESE tended to be marginally more efficient than those which targeted the donor or <b>acceptor</b> <b>splice</b> <b>sites,</b> based on their ability to induce specific skipping at lower concentrations. The specificity of exon removal {{does not appear to be}} a function of target selection, but may reflect the combination of the splicing motifs and position of that exon in the pre-mRNA...|$|R

50|$|Neural {{networks}} are computational models that excel at machine learning and pattern recognition. Neural networks must be trained with example data before {{being able to}} generalise for experimental data, and tested against benchmark data. Neural {{networks are}} {{able to come up}} with approximate solutions to problems that are hard to solve algorithmically, provided there is sufficient training data. When applied to gene prediction, neural networks can be used alongside other ab initio methods to predict or identify biological features such as splice sites. One approach involves using a sliding window, which traverses the sequence data in an overlapping manner. The output at each position is a score based on whether the network thinks the window contains a donor splice site or an <b>acceptor</b> <b>splice</b> <b>site.</b> Larger windows offer more accuracy but also require more computational power. A neural network is an example of a signal sensor as its goal is to identify a functional site in the genome.|$|E

Remarkably, circular RNA transcripts synthesized by the joining of the donor and acceptor splice sites of the same exon were detected in human epidermis for exons 4 and 5.

We have set out to explore in more depth some of these unique splicing patterns which include: i.) tandem <b>acceptor</b> <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> termed ’NAGNAGs’, which cause an exon length variation of three nucleotides, ii.) the splicing of internal cassette exons, whose inclusion and exclusion are strongly associated with their transcriptional start sites, iii.) and groups of internal cassette exons that are always observed to be either included or excluded together within a transcript. We did not ﬁnd much evidence of functional potential {{for the majority of}} variant <b>acceptor</b> <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> carrying the NAGNAG motif and thus conclude that their abundance is due mostly to the stochastic behaviour of the spliceosome. We inferred that a large fraction (15 - 30 %) of internal cassette exons in transcription units with multiple start sites are included and skipped in a transcription-start-site-dependent manner. We did not ﬁnd that this relationship is conserved in orthologous human and mouse exons. Our ﬁrst analysis has revealed several interesting trends in mutually dependent exons when compared to mutually exclusive and constitutive exons: these exons have a stronger pressure to maintain the reading frame as a group of exons rather than individually, and they generally have shorter intron lengths. Ours are the ﬁrst analyses of transcription-start-site-dependent and mutually-dependent splicing.

Methods: Both a mutated minigene with c. 607 – 1 G>A, and a wild-type minigene were constructed using the pTARGET TM mammalian expression vector. They were transiently transfected into HeLa cells and human lens epithelial cells, respectively. After 48 h incubation, RNA extraction and RT–PCR analysis were performed and PCR products were separated and confirmed by sequencing. Structural models of the wild-type and the mutant aquaporin 0 (AQP 0) were generated and analyzed using SWISS-MODEL. Results: The G>A transition activated a cryptic <b>acceptor</b> <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> (c. 965 – 966) in the 3 ′ untranslated region (3 ′ UTR), resulting {{in the absence of}} the coding region and most of the 3 ′UTR in exon 4 of the mature mRNA.

The most common mutation in Korean is replace-ment of histidine by arginine at codon 723 followed by exchange of guanine for adenine at the consensus <b>acceptor</b> <b>splice</b> <b>site</b> of intron 7, adenine to guanine change at position + 3 transition donor splice site of intron 9, methionine to valine at position 147, and frameshift mutation by insertion T at N-terminal 2.

40|$|CONTEXT: Missense loss-of-function {{mutations}} in TAC 3 and TACR 3, the genes encoding neurokinin B and its receptor NK 3 R, respectively, were recently discovered in kindreds with nonsyndromic normosmic congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH), thus identifying a fundamental role of this pathway {{in the human}} gonadotrope axis. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of the study was}} to investigate the consequences on gonadotrope axis of TAC 3 deletion and TACR 3 truncation in adult patients with normosmic complete CHH. RESULTS: We identified three unrelated patients with the same homozygous substitution in the TAC 3 intron 3 <b>acceptor</b> <b>splicing</b> <b>site</b> (c. 209 - 1 G>C) and three siblings who bore a homozygous mutation in the TACR 3 intron 2 <b>acceptor</b> <b>splicing</b> <b>site</b> (c. 738 - 1 G>A). We demonstrated that these two mutations, respectively, deleted neurokinin B and truncated its receptor NK 3 R. We found in three patients with TAC 3 mutation originating from Congo and Haiti a founding event in a more distant ancestor by means of haplotype analysis. We calculated that time to this common ancestor was approximately 21 generations. In several patients we observed a dissociation between the very low LH and normal or nearly normal FSH levels, this gonadotropin responding excessively to the GnRH challenge test. This particular hormonal profile, suggests the possibility of a specific neuroendocrine impairment in patients with alteration of neurokinin B signaling. Finally, in these patients, pulsatile GnRH administration normalized circulating sex steroids, LH release, and restored fertility in one subject. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate the hypothalamic origin of the gonadotropin deficiency in these genetic forms of normosmic CHH. Neurokinin B and NK 3 R therefore both play a crucial role in hypothalamic GnRH release in humans. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Feature {{selection}} {{techniques are}} often used to reduce data dimensionality, increase classification performance, and gain insight into the processes that generated the data. In this paper, we describe an iterative procedure of feature selection and feature construction steps, improving the classification of <b>acceptor</b> <b>splice</b> <b>sites,</b> an important subtask of gene prediction. We show that acceptor prediction can benefit from feature selection, and describe how feature selection techniques {{can be used to}} gain new insights in the classification of acceptor sites. This is illustrated by the identification of a new, biologically motivated feature: the AG-scanning feature. The results described in this paper contribute both to the domain of gene prediction, and to research in feature selection techniques, describing a new wrapper based feature weighting method that aids in knowledge discovery when dealing with complex datasets...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} common splice {{variations}} are small exon length variations caused by the use of alternative donor or <b>acceptor</b> <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> that are in very close proximity on the pre-mRNA. Among these, three-nucleotide variations at so-called NAGNAG tandem acceptor sites have recently attracted considerable attention, and {{it has been suggested that}} these variations are regulated and serve to fine-tune protein forms by the addition or removal of a single amino acid. In this paper we first show that in-frame exon length variations are generally overrepresented and that this overrepresentation can be quantitatively explained by the effect of nonsense-mediated decay. Our analysis allows us to estimate that about 50 % of frame-shifted coding transcripts are targeted by nonsense-mediated decay. Second, we show that a simple physical model that assumes that the splicing machinery stochastically binds to nearby <b>splice</b> <b>sites</b> in proportion to the affinities of the sites correctly predicts the relative abundances of different small length variations at both boundaries. Finally, using the same simple physical model, we show that for NAGNAG sites, the difference i...|$|R
