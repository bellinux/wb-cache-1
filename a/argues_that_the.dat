5|$|Hiltebeitel <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Kuttantavar cult might {{represent}} the original Tamil tradition regarding Aravan, {{however it is}} no longer the only tradition that venerates Aravan. The Draupadi cult has developed traditions and rituals of its own.|$|E
50|$|PNU <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{contract}} {{was at an}} end. <b>The</b> Ansleys <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> contract only ended due to PNU not pursing the consent in a proper manner.|$|R
50|$|While Pro-democracy groups <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police used {{excessive}} force, Pro-Beijing advocates disputed this claim. Some {{who supported}} Beijing <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> protestors violated {{the rule of}} law.|$|R

25|$|In their brief, the Bar of Human Rights Committee and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{shackling}} of Deck was a {{human rights}} violation. It was also <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shackles violated due process and common law and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shackles diminished courtroom dignity. Additionally, it was <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shackles contributed to self-incrimination, and prevented Deck from confronting witnesses against him.|$|R
5|$|Francis Parkman, an American {{historian}} {{who was one}} of the first to write about natives within the colonial historical narrative, <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Iroquois wars “were products of an ‘insensate fury’ and ‘mad ambition’". He said that the Iroquois waged wars due to the extinction of the beaver, their growing dependence on European goods, and resentment at the extermination of native culture. Parkman <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Iroquois had become so dependent on European goods that they needed these items in order to survive. In his research, Parkman had no evidence to support his claims. He assumed that the natives’ culture was inferior to the British-American, and overlooked potential reasons for the Iroquois attacks. Parkman’s interpretation neglected to explain why the Iroquois had waged war against other native groups as well. Parkman’s view would later on be dismissed due to its ethnocentric interpretation of the events.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the focal}} point of the {{painting}} is widely debated. Leo Steinberg <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> orthogonals in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. The man in the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, the crook of his arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E

50|$|Both parties <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sequels were {{transformative}} at {{the trial}} and first appellate level. Whereas Hugo's estate <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> transformative nature diluted the protected essential personality of <b>the</b> work, Plon <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> transformative nature was made it less likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> work borrowed the essential, protected personality. While this issue was not addressed by the Cour de Cassation, it is an argument which may bear fruit in subsequent droit moral litigation.|$|R
5|$|In her 2006 book on Opus Dei, Maggy Whitehouse, a non-Catholic journalist, <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{relative}} {{autonomy of}} each director and center {{has resulted in}} mistakes at the local level. She recommends greater consistency and transparency for Opus Dei, which she sees as having learned the lesson of greater openness when it faced {{the issues raised by}} The Da Vinci Code and other critics.|$|E
5|$|James was presumably an Italian, {{like the}} other members of the Gregorian mission. The dates of his birth and of his arrival in Britain are unknown. He went with Paulinus to Northumbria {{accompanying}} Æthelburh, sister of King Eadbald of Kent, who went to Northumbria to marry King Edwin. Traditionally this event is dated to 625, but the historian D. P. Kirby <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mission to Northumbria probably happened before 619.|$|E
5|$|Jesus for President {{is divided}} into four chapters, the first two of which {{summarize}} the Bible from a New Monastic perspective. The summary of the Old Testament <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Israelites had a unique political philosophy, but that they {{failed to live up}} to its implications. The New Testament summary considers Jesus' politics and the qualities of the Christian Church. The third chapter suggests implications of this narrative for citizens of the United States, who the authors describe as members of an empire similar to that of the Romans. This chapter <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Book of Revelation has more to do with living faithfully in an evil empire than with eschatology. The chapter also asserts that Constantinianism had generally negative consequences for the Church. The fourth chapter tells of Christians living in countercultural ways that model divine redemption towards others. Other stories involve heterodox economics, defending the homeless, Amish forgiveness, dumpster diving, missional robotics, Martin Luther King Jr., anti-war protests, and The Simple Way.|$|E
50|$|Nationwide News <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Act infringed {{the implied}} freedom of {{political}} communications, while <b>the</b> Commonwealth <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Act was valid under section 51(xxxv) (conciliation and arbitration power), {{as well as}} section 51(xxxix) (express incidental power).|$|R
50|$|The {{mayor of}} Whitefish, Montana, John Muhlfeld, <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bill would protect the town's water supply indefinitely {{and said the}} city fully {{supported}} the bill. Supporters also <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bill {{would be good for}} tourism.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lack of uniform {{protection}} against SLAPPs has encouraged forum shopping; proponents of federal legislation have <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> uncertainty about one's {{level of protection}} has likely magnified the chilling effect of SLAPPs.|$|R
5|$|Norte Chico {{sites are}} notable for {{exceptional}} collective density, {{as well as}} individual size. Haas <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> density of sites in such a small area is globally unique for a nascent civilization. During the third millennium BC, Norte Chico may have been the most densely populated area of the world (excepting, possibly, northern China). The Supe, Pativilca, Fortaleza, and Huaura River valleys each have several related sites.|$|E
5|$|S. C. Hawkes <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eight {{items in}} the hoard were found in {{different}} graves, basing this on x-ray and fluorescent analysis of the coins. However, the historian Philip Grierson thought {{that the possibility of}} two graves from different time periods both containing coins of the same period was so small as to make the likelihood of the hoard coming from two graves slim.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{intervention}} in Russia in 1918–19. He was indignant with Soviet accounts {{of a vast}} capitalist conspiracy against the world's first worker's state, some of which do not even mention the First World War; he was equally indignant with the decision to intervene as costly and harmful. He <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> interventions, by arousing Russian nationalism, may have ensured {{the survival of the}} Bolshevik state.|$|E
40|$|Conflict is so {{vital and}} complex {{an issue that}} it invites disagreement. Nehemia Friedland <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{cooperative}} and competitive approach focuses {{too much on the}} cognitive at the expense of motivation, whereas Jorn Rognes <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> framework needed to be supplemented by cognitive approaches. Evert van de Vliert critiqued the theory as not considering perceptional elements, whereas Ronald Fisher <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> approach was highly psychological and did not adequately consider structural, objective interests...|$|R
50|$|In October 2011, a Wellington-based Taranaki tribal {{collective}} <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Wharewaka did {{not constitute}} a marae, and therefore they <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Port Nicholson Block Settlement Trust should move a Trust review meeting to an actual marae in the Hutt Valley.|$|R
50|$|This {{school of}} thought is {{followed}} both by groups which <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> conflict model {{is the reality of}} criminal justice, but the consensus model is the ideal; and groups which <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> conflict model is both the reality and the ideal.|$|R
5|$|The East Midwood Jewish Center building's {{architect}} is uncertain. The {{design is}} officially credited to the Building Committee and Irving Warshaw, the construction superintendent. The architect's {{name is not}} recorded in synagogue records, nor on the building's dedicatory plaque. The Center's National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nomination form, however, <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> architect was Louis Abramson, based on visual evidence and one piece of written evidence.|$|E
5|$|The song {{falls into}} the idiom of {{previous}} minstrel music, relying on rhythm and text declamation as its primary motivation. Its melody is simple and the harmony little developed. Nevertheless, contemporary critics found the song more pleasant than previous minstrel fare. Musicologist Dale Cockrell <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> song represents a transition between early minstrel music and the more European-style songs of minstrelsy's later years.|$|E
5|$|A carving {{at the top}} of the stele portrays Hammurabi {{receiving}} the laws from Shamash, the Babylonian god of justice, and the preface states that Hammurabi was chosen by Shamash to bring the laws to them. Parallels between this narrative and the giving of laws by God in Jewish tradition to Moses and similarities between the two legal codes suggest a common ancestor in the Semitic background of the two. Fragments of previous law codes have been found. However David P. Wright <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Covenant Code of the Biblical Book of Exodus is 'directly, primarily, and throughout' based upon the Laws of Hammurabi.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the issue}} of peace {{negotiations}} with <b>the</b> Taliban Naeem <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{certain parts of the}} Taliban want peace and could be compromised with. Sultanzoy <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Taliban was a tool of foreign intelligence agencies, and that in order to marginalize the Taliban the Afghan people needed to unite behind a unifying goal. Hilal <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Taliban was a diverse group, with certain members being driven by poverty, whilst others were [...] "agents of intelligence agencies." [...] Hilal <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> former parts could and should be negotiated with. Arsala <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> if <b>the</b> Taliban embraced politics, instead of violence, that they could be given a [...] "chair in the cabinet." ...|$|R
40|$|In the thesis, Fodor’s {{arguments}} against computationalism are defeated. His arguments appeal to syntactic constraints and intractability. We <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> arguments based on syntactic constraints are not satisfactory. We then <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> argument via intractability is not satisfactory either. We also discuss various {{approaches to the}} problem of abduction in a computationalist setting. We <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> social solution <b>that</b> human everyday cognitive activity is not isotropic and Quinean is correct. Secondly, we <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> local solution is too preliminary a proposal. We give our objections concerning the calculation of the effect to effort ratio and <b>the</b> claim <b>that</b> memory organization leads one to relevant information. Thirdly, we <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> natural language approach is circular. Fourthly, we arguedthat the web search approach provides a partial account of finding relevant information but leaves out the key problem of evaluating the search results. Fifthly, we <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> global workspace approach relegates {{the most important part of}} the solution to consciousness. In the end, we give a framework sketching mechanisms <b>that</b> could solve <b>the</b> problem of abduction. published_or_final_versionPhilosophyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
