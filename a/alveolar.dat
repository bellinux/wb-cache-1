5|$|Alveoli {{consist of}} {{two types of}} <b>alveolar</b> cell and an <b>alveolar</b> macrophage. The two types of cell are known as type I and type II <b>alveolar</b> cells (also known as pneumocytes). Types I and II make up the walls and <b>alveolar</b> septa. Type I cells provide 95% of the surface area of each alveoli and are flat ("squamous"), and Type II cells {{generally}} cluster {{in the corners of}} the alveoli and have a cuboidal shape. Despite this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.|$|E
5|$|It {{is only as}} {{a result}} of {{accurately}} maintaining the composition of the 3 litres <b>alveolar</b> air that, with each breath, some carbon dioxide is discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up from the outside air. If more carbon dioxide than usual has been lost by a short period of hyperventilation, breathing will be slowed down or halted until the <b>alveolar</b> partial pressure of carbon dioxide has returned to 5.3kPa (40mmHg). The opposite occurs after breath-holding.|$|E
5|$|The <b>alveolar</b> macrophages have an {{important}} immunological role. They remove substances which deposit in the alveoli including loose red blood cells that have been forced out from blood vesels.|$|E
5|$|The lung is {{the main}} site of SFTPA1 synthesis, but SFTPA1 mRNA {{expression}} has also been detected in the trachea, prostate, pancreas, thymus, colon, eye, salivary gland and other tissues. Using specific monoclonal antibodies for Surfactant protein A, the protein can be detected in lung <b>alveolar</b> type II pneumocytes, club cells, and <b>alveolar</b> macrophages, but no extrapulmonary SP-A immunoreactivity was observed.|$|E
5|$|The lung is {{the main}} site of SFTPA2 synthesis, but SFTPA2 mRNA {{expression}} has also been detected in the trachea, prostate, pancreas, thymus, colon, eye, salivary gland and other tissues. While {{the majority of these}} tissues express both SFTPA2 and SFTPA1 transcripts, only SFTPA2 expression was found in the trachea and prostate. Using specific monoclonal antibodies for Surfactant protein A, the protein can be detected in lung <b>alveolar</b> type II pneumocytes, Clara cells, and <b>alveolar</b> macrophages, but no extrapulmonary SP-A immunoreactivity was observed.|$|E
5|$|Type I are {{squamous}} {{epithelial cells}} {{that make up}} the <b>alveolar</b> wall structure. They have extremely thin walls that enable an easy gas exchange. These type I cells also make up the <b>alveolar</b> septa which separate each alveolus. The septa consist of an epithelial lining and associated basement membranes. Type I cells are not able to divide, and consequently rely on differentiation from Type II cells.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the lower}} {{respiratory}} tract including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. This is a ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucus, and club cells with actions similar to macrophages. Incomplete rings of cartilage in the trachea and smaller plates of cartilage in the bronchi, keep these airways open. Bronchioles are too narrow to support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this is largely absent in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium. The respiratory tract ends in lobules. Each lobule consists of a respiratory bronchiole, which branches into <b>alveolar</b> ducts and <b>alveolar</b> sacs, which in turn divide into alveoli.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} a single letter for the coronal places of {{articulation}} for all consonants but fricatives, when dealing with a particular language, the letters may be treated as specifically dental, <b>alveolar,</b> or post-alveolar, as appropriate for that language, without diacritics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alveolar</b> osteitis is a {{complication}} of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom teeth) {{in which the}} blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth used to be empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. The pain is moderate to severe, and dull, aching, and throbbing in character. The pain is localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts two to {{four days after the}} extraction, and may last 10–40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for five to seven days. There is some evidence that chlorhexidine mouthwash used prior to extractions prevents <b>alveolar</b> osteitis.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of the maxillary sinus can be {{referred}} to the upper back teeth. The posterior, middle and anterior superior <b>alveolar</b> nerves are all closely associated with the lining of the sinus. The bone between the floor of the maxillary sinus and the roots of the upper back teeth is very thin, and frequently the apices of these teeth disrupt the contour of the sinus floor. Consequently, acute or chronic maxillary sinusitis can be perceived as maxillary toothache, and neoplasms of the sinus (such as adenoid cystic carcinoma) can cause similarly perceived toothache if malignant invasion of the superior <b>alveolar</b> nerves occurs. Classically, sinusitis pain increases upon Valsalva maneuvers or tilting the head forward.|$|E
5|$|Idiopathic {{interstitial}} pneumonia or noninfectious pneumonia is a {{class of}} diffuse lung diseases. They include diffuse <b>alveolar</b> damage, organizing pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease, and usual interstitial pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|In the {{inertial}} effect, {{the lighter}} <b>alveolar</b> tissue is sheared from the heavier hilar structures, an effect similar to {{diffuse axonal injury}} in head injury. It results {{from the fact that}} different tissues have different densities, and therefore different rates of acceleration or deceleration.|$|E
5|$|Other, more {{invasive}} procedures, {{also exist}} for larger bone defects including mobilization of the inferior <b>alveolar</b> nerve to allow placement of a fixture, onlay bone grafting using the iliac crest or another large source of bone and microvascular bone graft where {{the blood supply}} to the bone is transplanted with the source bone and reconnected to the local blood supply. The final decision about which bone grafting technique that is best {{is based on an}} assessment of the degree of vertical and horizontal bone loss that exists, each of which is classified into mild (2–3mm loss), moderate (4–6mm loss) or severe (greater than 6mm loss). Orthodontic extrusion or orthodontic implant site development can be used in selected cases for vertical/horizontal <b>alveolar</b> augmentation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>alveolar</b> bone is {{the bone}} of the jaw which forms the {{alveolus}} around teeth. Like any other bone {{in the human}} body, <b>alveolar</b> bone is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth. As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics, an area of bone under compressive force from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has {{a high number of}} osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.|$|E
5|$|The major {{function}} of the lungs is gas exchange between the lungs and the blood. The <b>alveolar</b> and pulmonary capillary gases equilibrate across the blood–air barrier, a very thin diffusion membrane which is only, on average, about 2μm thick, consisting of {{the walls of the}} pulmonary alveoli, consisting of the <b>alveolar</b> epithelial cells, their basement membranes and the endothelial cells of the pulmonary capillaries. This membrane is folded into about 300 million small air sacs called alveoli (each between 75 and 300µm in diameter) branching off from the bronchioles in the lungs, thus providing an extremely large surface area (estimates varying between 70 and 145m2) for gas exchange to occur.|$|E
5|$|At birth {{the lungs}} are very undeveloped with only around one sixth of the alveoli {{of the adult}} lung present. The alveoli {{continue}} to form into early adulthood, {{and their ability to}} form when necessary is seen in the regeneration of the lung. <b>Alveolar</b> septa have a double capillary network instead of the single network of the developed lung. Only after the maturation of the capillary network can the lung enter a normal phase of growth. Following the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli being enlarged.|$|E
5|$|Bats possess highly adapted lung {{systems to}} cope with the {{pressures}} of powered-flight. Flight is an energetically taxing aerobic activity and requires large amounts of oxygen to be sustained. In bats, the relative <b>alveolar</b> surface area and pulmonary capillary blood volume are significantly larger than most other small quadrupedal mammals. Due to the restraints of the mammalian lungs, bats cannot maintain high-altitude flight.|$|E
5|$|Occlusal trauma {{results from}} {{excessive}} biting forces exerted on teeth, which overloads the periodontal ligament, causing periodontal pain and a reversible increase in tooth mobility. Occlusal trauma may occur with bruxism, the parafunctional (abnormal) clenching and grinding of teeth during sleep or while awake. Over time, {{there may be}} attrition (tooth wear), which may also cause dentin hypersensitivity, and possibly formation of a periodontal abscess, as the occlusal trauma causes adaptive changes in the <b>alveolar</b> bone.|$|E
5|$|Oral trauma, {{including}} {{recession of}} gingival tissue and dental fracture and wear. Recession of gingival tissue affects 19% to 68% of subjects with lip and/or intra-oral ornaments. In some cases, the <b>alveolar</b> tooth-bearing bone is also involved, jeopardizing {{the stability and}} durability of the teeth in place and requiring a periodontal regeneration surgery. Dental fracture and wear affects 14% to 41% of subjects with lip and/or intra-oral ornaments.|$|E
5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament becomes inflamed {{and there}} may be pain when biting or tapping on the tooth. On an X-ray, bone resporption appears as a radiolucent area around the end of the root, although this does not manifest immediately. Acute apical periodontitis is characterized by well-localized, spontaneous, persistent, moderate to severe pain. The <b>alveolar</b> process may be tender to palpation over the roots. The tooth may be raised in the socket and feel more prominent than the adjacent teeth.|$|E
5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament is {{a specialized}} connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the <b>alveolar</b> bone. This tissue covers {{the root of}} the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15–0.38mm, but this size decreases over time. The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and resorption of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption. The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and epithelial cell rests of Malassez. Consisting of mostly Type I and III collagen, the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location. The groups of fibers are named <b>alveolar</b> crest, horizontal, oblique, periapical, and interradicular fibers. The nerve supply generally enters from the bone apical to the tooth and forms a network around the tooth toward the crest of the gingiva. When pressure is exerted on a tooth, such as during chewing or biting, the tooth moves slightly in its socket and puts tension on the periodontal ligaments. The nerve fibers can then send the information to the central nervous system for interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} may {{be altered}} by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth {{is said to}} be impacted. The most common cause of tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth. Other causes may be tumors, cysts, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. Tooth ankylosis occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the <b>alveolar</b> bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.|$|E
5|$|With {{a minimum}} <b>alveolar</b> {{concentration}} (MAC) of 0.16%, methoxyflurane {{is an extremely}} potent anesthetic agent. It is a powerful analgesic agent at well below full anesthetic concentrations. Because of its low volatility and very high boiling point (104.8°C at 1atmosphere), methoxyflurane has a low vapor pressure at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. It is therefore quite difficult to vaporize methoxyflurane using conventional anesthetic vaporizers.|$|E
5|$|Xenon has {{a minimum}} <b>alveolar</b> {{concentration}} (MAC) of 72% at age 40, making it 44% more potent than N2O as an anesthetic. Thus, {{it can be}} used with oxygen in concentrations that have a lower risk of hypoxia. Unlike nitrous oxide (N2O), xenon is not a greenhouse gas and is viewed as environmentally friendly. Though recycled in modern systems, xenon vented to the atmosphere is only returning to its original source, without environmental impact.|$|E
5|$|When a more {{exacting}} plan {{is needed}} beyond clinical judgment, the dentist {{will make an}} acrylic guide (called a stent) prior to surgery which guides optimal positioning of the implant. Increasingly, dentists opt to get a CT scan of the jaws and any existing dentures, then plan the surgery on CAD/CAM software. The stent can then be made using stereolithography following computerized planning of a case from the CT scan. The use of CT scanning in complex cases also helps the surgeon identify and avoid vital structures such as the inferior <b>alveolar</b> nerve and the sinus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Alveolar</b> osteitis is {{inflammation}} of the <b>alveolar</b> bone (i.e., the <b>alveolar</b> process of the maxilla or mandible). Classically, this occurs as a postoperative complication of tooth extraction.|$|E
25|$|See voiced <b>alveolar</b> tapped fricative, voiceless <b>alveolar</b> tapped fricative.|$|E
25|$|Araki has {{an unusually}} high number of phonemic {{differentiation}} on the <b>alveolar</b> point of articulation. Particularly notable is {{the existence of a}} contrast between the <b>alveolar</b> trill and the <b>alveolar</b> flap one.|$|E
25|$|Its {{place of}} {{articulation}} is dental, <b>alveolar</b> or post-alveolar, {{which means it}} is articulated behind upper front teeth, at the <b>alveolar</b> ridge or behind the <b>alveolar</b> ridge. It is most often apical, which means that it is pronounced {{with the tip of}} the tongue.|$|E
25|$|Its {{place of}} {{articulation}} is laminal <b>alveolar,</b> {{which means it}} is articulated with the blade of the tongue at the <b>alveolar</b> ridge.|$|E
25|$|<b>Alveolar,</b> {{which means}} it is {{articulated}} with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the <b>alveolar</b> ridge, termed respectively apical and laminal.|$|E
25|$|Some {{languages}} contrast laminal denti-alveolar and apical <b>alveolar</b> nasals. For example, in the Malayalam pronunciation of Nārāyanan, {{the first}} n is dental, {{the second is}} retroflex, and the third <b>alveolar.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>alveolar</b> nasal {{is a type}} of consonantal sound used in {{numerous}} spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents dental, <b>alveolar,</b> and postalveolar nasals is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is n.|$|E
25|$|English {{does not}} have an <b>alveolar</b> click (or any click consonant, for that matter) as a phoneme, but a plain <b>alveolar</b> click does occur in mimesis, as a sound {{children}} use to imitate a horse trotting.|$|E
25|$|Unlike active {{articulation}}, passive articulation is {{a continuum}} without many clear-cut boundaries. The places linguolabial and interdental, interdental and dental, dental and <b>alveolar,</b> <b>alveolar</b> and palatal, palatal and velar, velar and uvular merge into one another, and a consonant may be pronounced {{somewhere between the}} named places.|$|E
25|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} {{could be a}} {{determinant}} risk factor {{in the frequency of}} <b>Alveolar</b> Osteitis. Studies have shown that because of hormonal changes, women in the middle of menstrual cycle and the ones taking oral contraceptives (birth control pills) have a higher tendency of having <b>Alveolar</b> Osteitis after their tooth extraction surgery. It is recommended that elective surgeries be performed during the menstrual period in both oral contraceptives users and non users to eliminate the effect of cycle-related hormonal changes on the development of <b>Alveolar</b> Osteitis.|$|E
