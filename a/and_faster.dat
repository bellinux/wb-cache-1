40|$|In this thesis, new {{techniques}} to generate slow <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> light are proposed and investigated. The {{use of the}} slow <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> light for microwave photonics applications is also investigated. This thesis consists of four parts. In the first part, the generation of slow <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> light based on fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) is studied. Two techniques are proposed. In the first technique, slow <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> light is generated based on a linearly chirped fiber Bragg grating (LCFBG); {{and in the second}} technique, slow <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> light is generated based on a tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG). Theoretical analysis is performed which is verified by experiments. In the second part, the applications of FBG-based slow <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> light in microwave photonics are studied. These applications include all-optical tunable microwave frequency multiplication, tunable microwave chirped pulse generation, tunable phase shifting, tunable fractional order differentiation, and tunable microwave photonic filtering. In the third part, the generation of slow <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> light based on microring resonators (MRRs) is studied. Novel methods to obtain continuously tunable slow to fast light are proposed and experimentally demonstrated by using a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) MRR with MMI (multi-mode interference) couplers, and a high-contrast Ge-doped silica-on-silicon (SOS) MRR. In the fourth part, the applications of the MRR-based slow <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> light in microwave photonics are studied. These applications include all-optical tunable fractional order differentiation, and tunable fractional order Hilbert transformation...|$|R

A final, much larger vessel, , was laid down in 1892; her design was based on contemporary protected cruisers like Kaiserin Augusta.

5|$|For {{decades after}} the {{discovery}} of GRBs, astronomers searched for a counterpart at other wavelengths: i.e., any astronomical object in positional coincidence with a recently observed burst. Astronomers considered many distinct classes of objects, including white dwarfs, pulsars, supernovae, globular clusters, quasars, Seyfert galaxies, and BL Lac objects. All such searches were unsuccessful, {{and in a few}} cases particularly well-localized bursts (those whose positions were determined with what was then a high degree of accuracy) could be clearly shown to have no bright objects of any nature consistent with the position derived from the detecting satellites. This suggested an origin of either very faint stars or extremely distant galaxies. Even the most accurate positions contained numerous faint stars and galaxies, and it was widely agreed that final resolution of the origins of cosmic gamma-ray bursts would require both new satellites <b>and</b> <b>faster</b> communication.|$|E

NSB abolished its branding of only having red trains, and introduced a blue and silver livery on the Class 73 trains. The new service had fewer stops <b>and</b> <b>faster</b> travel times.

5|$|Nike Zeus was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} straightforward development of the earlier Hercules system giving it the ability to hit ICBM warheads at about the same range and altitude as the maximum performance of the Hercules. In theory, hitting a warhead is no more difficult than an aircraft; the interceptor does not have to travel any further or faster, the computers that guide it simply have to select an intercept point farther in front of the target to compensate for the target's much higher speed. In practice, the difficulty is detecting the target early enough that the intercept point is still within range of the missile. This demands much larger and more powerful radar systems, <b>and</b> <b>faster</b> computers.|$|E

On 25April1992, the aircraft sustained serious damage during a landing attempt as a result of pilot-induced oscillations. It was repaired but never flew again, and instead served as a static test vehicle thereafter. In 1991, it was anticipated that 650 production F-22s would be procured.|$|E

Methods: A case control study conducted at the National Diabetes Center, College of Medicine at Al-Mustansiryia University from 1 August 2008 to 30 January 2010. An enzyme spectrophotometric method was used to determine fasting glucose, while HPLC Technique determined leptin and insulin hormones in serum of patients with diabetes mellitus (n= 61) and normal healthy subjects as controls (n= 63).
