40|$|Jet vacuum {{ejectors}} {{currently used}} have a defect of large air consumption {{due to the}} need of continuous and constant air supply. To solve this problem, a novel technical structure of the jet vacuum ejector with flow self-regulation by an <b>adjustable</b> <b>cone</b> has been investigated. In this paper, the structure, key technologies and experiment of this new jet vacuum ejector are introduced. In the new ejector, {{by means of the}} <b>adjustable</b> <b>cone,</b> the effective cross section at the jet nozzle throat could be adjusted so as to realize the reduction of air supply and achieve energy saving. For this, a key technology for the new structure called chamber-separating pneumatic-magnetic driving is studied, in which a vacuum detecting-differential pressure actuating and non-contacting pneumatic-magnetic driving with a coaxial magnetic ring-axial structure are implemented. Experimental results for the flow self-regulated vacuum ejector have shown that the vacuum response time and maximum vacuum of new ejector are almost equivalent to the constant-area vacuum ejectors with the relative parameters, but the air consumption could save about 14. 8 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of the formation of}} zero-order Bessel light beams using a uniaxial crystal with cylindrical electrodes is investigated. It is shown that, if a given polarization distribution is provided in the incident beam, a Bessel light beam with the cone angle controlled by an external electric field is formed. It is proposed to use this result for the matching of the axicon parameters and creation of conical lenses with an <b>adjustable</b> <b>cone</b> angle...|$|E
40|$|As a {{localized}} {{cooling device}} the vortex tube {{is being used}} is several applications due to its simplicity, robustness and maintenance free service. Its design still depends on experiment based empirical relations and thumb rules. Capturing complete flow and energy separation features of vortex tube through experimentation is difficult due to the complexity associated to flow Numerical investigation of the vortex tube presented here intends to bring out unexplored features. The work is done on a 3 D model of vortex tube with 6 nozzles and an <b>adjustable</b> <b>cone</b> valve. The parameters varied in the investigation are supply air pressure from 2 to 6 bars, the orifice diameter from 5 to 10 mm, L/D ratio from 4 to 20. The mechanism of flow and energy separation is completely explained based on present work. The impact of important performance parameters such as supply pressure, cold orifice diameter, tube diameter and its length suggest improvement in the present thumb rule for better vortex tube performance. Present work investigates the effect of working environment also where tube is assumed work under constant wall temperature and constant wall heat flux condition. It concludes that cooling performance of the tube is independent of thermal condition imposed on its wall...|$|E

50|$|At the time, {{the company}} benefited from {{cutting-edge}} technical help from NHK Science & Technical Research Laboratories -- {{a relationship that}} would continue for many years. In 1947 Mitsubishi produced an <b>adjustable</b> resonance <b>cone,</b> and combined it with the OP magnet to produce the 16 cm P-62 F-type dynamic speaker (the antecedent of the P-610).|$|R
5000|$|The Thompson {{bottom bracket}} uses <b>adjustable</b> spindle <b>cones</b> and cups {{pressed into the}} bottom bracket shell like the Ashtabula bottom bracket. Unlike the Ashtabula crank, the non-drive side crank is removable, {{allowing}} for a smaller bottom bracket shell. Frames with either Italian or English bottom bracket shell diameters (independent of threading) may be fitted with Thompson bottom brackets. [...] Thompson bottom brackets are rare. The design {{is similar to a}} typical hub bearing and theoretically supports the load better, but is hard to seal effectively against dirt and water.|$|R
40|$|The waving-wand {{system of}} {{broadcast}} chemical application implemented in swath widths to 40 ft (> 12 m) {{is capable of}} simulating broadcast deposition patterns for herbicides similar to those delivered by helicopter. Drop sizes vary from center to edge of swaths, which can range from > 1, 000 to 5, 000 microns (μ). Any backpack sprayer is suitable for such treatments {{if it has a}} brass adjustable-cone nozzle and is operated by a trained operator. Effective 3 -yr vegetation control was achieved on two forest ecosystem management research areas with a total of 42 plots, ranging from 1. 2 – 1. 8 ac (0. 5 – 0. 73 ha) in size, on variously steep terrain. Experimental applications of glyphosate (1. 5 lb a. e. /ac, 1. 7 kg/ha) plus imazapyr (2. 0 or 2. 8 oz a. i. /ac, 0. 14 or 0. 2 kg/ha) plus sulfometuron (2. 3 oz a. i. /ac, 0. 16 kg/ha) in water at 3 gal/ac total volume (28 L/ha) or glyphosate plus imazapyr in a total spray volume of 5 gal/ac (47 L/ha) provided excellent control of numerous deciduous shrubs and two species of ferns following July applications. Equipment consisted of a 6 -gal (23 L) backpack sprayer with a single <b>adjustable</b> <b>cone</b> nozzle. Operational considerations focus on consistency of walking speed, swing, and nozzle setting. Rates of 1. 0 - 2. 5 ac (0. 4 to 1. 0 ha) /operator hour are achievable, depending on obstacles. The method appears suitable and practicable for highly translocated, low-toxicity products applied to target vegetation < 10 ft (< 3 m) tall and to understories where individual targets may be up to 16 ft (5 m) tall. Low volume is a major logistical benefit. This system is suited for most broadcast site preparation and release areas unsuitable for aerial application, and understory target areas beneath overstories dense enough to intercept significant herbicide if aerially applied...|$|E
