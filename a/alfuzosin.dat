40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare {{doxazosin}} and <b>alfuzosin</b> {{in patients}} with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of bladder outlet obstruction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 210 men with LUTS were randomized to receive doxazosin 1 - 8 mg once daily or <b>alfuzosin</b> 5 - 10 mg divided {{in two or three}} daily doses in a 14 -week, multicentre, double-blind, baseline-controlled, dose-titration study. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and maximum urinary flow rate were used to assess the efficacy of the treatment. RESULTS: At study completion, the mean dose of doxazosin was 6. 1 mg/day and <b>alfuzosin</b> 8. 8 mg/day. The least squares mean (se) change from baseline in total IPSS was - 9. 23 (0. 6) for doxazosin and - 7. 45 (0. 6) (both P < 0. 001) for <b>alfuzosin.</b> The respective mean change from baseline in irritative symptoms was - 3. 5 (0. 2) and - 2. 8 (0. 3) (both P < 0. 001). The differences between the treatment groups were statistically significant in favour of doxazosin (total IPSS, P = 0. 036; irritative symptoms, P = 0. 049). The improvement between groups was also significantly different for postvoid residual urine volume, at - 29. 19 (8. 6) and + 9. 59 (8. 9) mL for doxazosin and <b>alfuzosin,</b> respectively (P = 0. 002).

Men with bothersome LUTS/BPH often present with various other age-related conditions, including sexual dysfunction, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome, which can complicate management decisions. Therefore, healthcare providers should be familiar with first-line treatment options for LUTS/BPH and their differing safety profiles, {{particularly with respect to}} cardiovascular and sexual function side effects. This article presents a review of first-line medical therapy options for managing aging men with LUTS/BPH and patient considerations when evaluating and selecting these therapies, with a focus on the clinical efficacy and cardiovascular and sexual function safety profiles of the uroselective α 1 -adrenergic receptor antagonist <b>alfuzosin</b> 10 mg once daily. <b>Alfuzosin</b> improves LUTS, peak urinary flow rates, and disease-specific quality of life, reduces the long-term risk of overall BPH progression, and is well tolerated in aging men, with minimal vasodilatory and sexual function side effects, even in those with comorbidities. <b>Alfuzosin</b> is well tolerated when used in combination with antihypertensive medications and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. The long-term clinical efficacy and good cardiovascular and sexual function safety profile of <b>alfuzosin</b> can contribute to an improved quality of life for aging men with LUTS/BPH.

40|$|Purpose: The main {{objective}} of the investigation {{was to develop a}} transdermal therapeutic system for <b>alfuzosin</b> hydrochloride and to study the effects of polymeric system and loading dose on the in vitro skin permeation pattern. Materials and methods: Principles of experimental design have been exploited to develop the dosage form. Ratio of ethyl cellulose (EC) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and loading dose were selected as independent variables and their influence on the cumulative amount of <b>alfuzosin</b> hydrochloride permeated per cm 2 of human cadaver skin at 24 h (Q 24), permeation flux (J) and steady state permeability coefficient (P SS) were studied using experimental design. Various physicochemical parameters of the transdermal films were also evaluated. Activation energy for in vitro transdermal permeation has been estimated. Results: Ratio of EC and PVP was found to be the main influential factor for all the dependent variables studied. Drug loading dose was also found to influence the dependent variables but to a lesser extent. Physicochemical parameters of the prepared films were evaluated and found satisfactory. Activation energy for <b>alfuzosin</b> permeation has also been estimated and reported. Conclusion: The therapeutic system was found to be dermatologically non-irritant and hence, a therapeutically effective amount of <b>alfuzosin</b> hydrochloride can be delivered via a transdermal route...|$|E
40|$|A double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} {{study in}} 20 patients with 'prostatitis syndromes' and confirmed urodynamic abnormalities using the alpha 1 -receptor-blocking compound <b>alfuzosin</b> is reported. Flow rate recordings {{are probably the}} most reliable and useful objective variables in this type of investigation. There is a significant beneficial effect in the group using an active compound concerning maximal flow (p = 0. 01), flow time (p = 0. 03) and time to maximal flow (p = 0. 01). However, compared with the group using a placebo, only the change in the maximal flow rate appeared to be significantly different. Subjective effects were more pronounced in the <b>alfuzosin</b> group, but the spurious nature of the subjective observations is stressed. Based on objective parameters, <b>alfuzosin</b> seems to be effective compared to placebo in the treatment of these patients with micturition complaints of an irritative nature and urodynamic abnormalities, while only minor side effects were notice...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose Postoperative urinary {{retention}} (POUR) {{is one of}} the most common complications after surgical procedures under spinal anaesthesia. Recent studies have shown the beneficial effects of alpha-adrenergic blockers in preventing POUR. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate and compare the prophylactic effects of tamsulosin and <b>alfuzosin</b> on POUR after urologic surgical procedures under spinal anaesthesia. Materials and Methods A total of 180 males who underwent elective urologic surgery were included in this study. The patients were randomly allocated into three Groups. The Group I received placebo. Patients in Group II were given 0. 4 mg of tamsulosin orally 14 and 2 hours before surgery. Patients in Group III were given 10 mg of <b>alfuzosin</b> ER orally 10 and 2 hours before surgery. All patients were closely followed for 24 hours postoperatively and their episodes of {{urinary retention}}s were recorded. Results There were 60 patients in each Group. Their mean age was 35. 95 ± 15. 16 years. Fifteen patients in Group I (25 %), 3 patients in Group II (5 %) and 4 patients in Group III (6. 7 %) required catheterization because of urinary retention. In tamsulosin group and <b>alfuzosin</b> group, there were a significantly lower proportion of patients with POUR compared with the placebo Group (p= 0. 002 and p= 0. 006). The beneficial effects of tamsulosin and <b>alfuzosin</b> on POUR were similar between both Groups (p= 0. 697). Conclusion This study suggests that the use of prophylactic tamsulosin or <b>alfuzosin</b> can reduce the incidence of urinary retention and the need for catheterization after urologic surgical procedures under spinal anaesthesia...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{symptomatic}} outcome following transurethral prostatectomy (TURF), alpha-blockade and placebo treatment in uncomplicated {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}} (BPH), 260 patients were evaluated with the recently formulated Danish Prostatic Symptom Score (DAN-PSS- 1) system: 205 were randomized to either the selective alpha-blocker <b>alfuzosin</b> or placebo and 55 underwent TURF. Following TURF, the DAN-PSS- 1 score was reduced by 80 % after 6 - 10 weeks (visit 2) and by 100 % after 12 - 16 weeks (visit 3). In the <b>alfuzosin</b> group the corresponding reductions were 40 % and 65 % (p < 0. 02 vs. placebo). In the placebo group the reduction was 25 % at visit 2, with no further fall demonstrated thereafter. During <b>alfuzosin</b> treatment the bother score (impact of symptoms on quality of life) fell more than the symptom score. During placebo treatment there was no reduction in symptom score. We conclude that the DAN-PSS- 1 questionnaire sensitively identifies clinically important responses to treatment of BPH...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT − Manufacturing a multi-layered tablet such as Xatral XL ® is {{more complex}} and {{expensive}} than monolayered tablets, but mono-layered tablets may have less favorable release properties depending on the pharmacodynamics and phar-macokinetics of the active ingredient. We therefore sought to develop a monolayer tablet with a similar dissolution profile to the commercial <b>alfuzosin</b> sustained-release triple layered tablet (Xatral XL®). We prepared four different mono-layered <b>alfuzosin</b> tablets with different concentrations of hydroxypropyl methycellulose and PVP K- 90. Fomulation III with alfu-zosion / mg-stearate / HPMC / PVP K- 90 (10 / 5 / 110 / 95 mg/tab) has a similar dissolution rate to Xatral XL®, with a similarity factor score of 81. 4. However, the swelling and erosion rates of the two formulations were different, and NIR analysis showed differences in the mechanisms of drug release. Thus, although formulation III and Xatral XL ® show similar dis-solution rates, the mechanisms of drug release are different. Key words − <b>Alfuzosin</b> HCl, Xatral XL®, HPMC, PVP, Mono-layered tablet <b>Alfuzosin</b> HCl is approved {{for the treatment of}} benign pro-static hyperplasia and given as 2. 5 mg three times a day or as a sustained-release form as 5 mg two times a day. However, the need for repeated administration reduces patient compli-ance (Jardin et al., 1999; Buzelin et al., 1993; Jardin et al. ...|$|E
