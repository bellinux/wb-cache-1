5|$|As of September 2017, {{reconstruction}} of the damaged lower section of the spillway was about one-third complete, {{with the goal of}} making the spillway operational by November 1. In 2018, the upper section of the spillway which was undamaged by the flood but also has been identified as structurally defective, will be demolished and rebuilt. In addition, crews <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>to</b> extend a cutoff wall under the emergency spillway to prevent erosion should that structure be used again in the future.|$|E
5|$|City leaders <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>to</b> {{bring new}} life into this area, by renovating and {{building}} new homes and attracting businesses. The completion of Interstate 664 restored the area to access and through traffic which had been largely rerouted with {{the completion of the}} Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel in 1958 and discontinuance of the Newport News-Norfolk ferry service at that time. The larger capacity Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel and the rebuilt James River Bridge each restored some accessibility and through traffic to the downtown area.|$|E

5|$|Today, mirror {{symmetry}} is a {{major research}} topic in pure mathematics, and mathematicians <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>to</b> develop a mathematical {{understanding of the relationship}} based on physicists' intuition. Mirror symmetry is also a fundamental tool for doing calculations in string theory, and it has been used to understand aspects of quantum field theory, the formalism that physicists use to describe elementary particles. Major approaches to mirror symmetry include the homological mirror symmetry program of Maxim Kontsevich and the SYZ conjecture of Andrew Strominger, Shing-Tung Yau, and Eric Zaslow.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{initiatives}} <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>to</b> reduce costs of electric power from offshore wind. One {{example is the}} Carbon Trust Offshore Wind Accelerator, a joint industry project, involving nine offshore wind developers, which aims {{to reduce the cost}} of offshore wind by 10% by 2015. It has been suggested that innovation at scale could deliver 25% cost reduction in offshore wind by 2020. Henrik Stiesdal, former Chief Technical Officer at Siemens Wind Power, has stated that by 2025 energy from offshore wind {{will be one of the}} cheapest, scalable solutions in the UK, compared to other renewables and fossil fuel energy sources, if the true cost to society is factored into the cost of energy equation. He calculates the cost at that time to be 43 EUR/MWh for onshore, and 72 EUR/MWh for offshore wind.|$|E

5|$|As Mr. Burns {{fights for}} {{life at the}} hospital, the Springfield police <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>to</b> find his assailant. Smithers wakes {{up the next morning}} and vaguely remembers {{shooting}} someone the night before in a drunken rage. Guilt-ridden, Smithers heads for a local church, and is promptly arrested when the confessional {{turns out to be a}} police sting. While passing the media on his way to the police station, Smithers makes a witty remark Sideshow Mel recognizes from an episode of Pardon My Zinger that aired at the same time as the shooting. Mel realizes Smithers must have watched it as well, giving him an alibi. As Smithers' memory clears, it turns out he had actually shot Jasper in his wooden leg. Meanwhile, the townsmen pull down the sun-blocker, which crushes Shelbyville to their delight.|$|E
5|$|Crop {{diversity}} loss threatens global food security, as the world's {{human population}} {{depends on a}} diminishing number of varieties of a diminishing number of crop species. Crops are increasingly grown in monoculture, meaning that if, as in the historic Irish Potato Famine, a single disease overcomes a variety's resistance, it may destroy an entire harvest, or {{as in the case}} of the 'Gros Michel' banana, may cause the commercial extinction of an entire variety. With the help of seed banks, international organizations <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>to</b> preserve crop diversity.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{are valued}} as food by humans and also have many {{cultural}} roles in literature, symbolism and religion. Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than {{one third of}} species {{are considered to be}} threatened with extinction and over one hundred and twenty are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has spread around the world. Conservation biologists <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>to</b> understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them.|$|E

5|$|In physics, mirror {{symmetry}} {{is justified}} on physical grounds. However, mathematicians generally require rigorous proofs {{that do not}} require an appeal to physical intuition. From a mathematical point of view, the version of mirror symmetry described above is still only a conjecture, but there is another version of mirror symmetry in the context of topological string theory, a simplified version of string theory introduced by Edward Witten, which has been rigorously proven by mathematicians. In the context of topological string theory, mirror symmetry states that two theories called the A-model and B-model are equivalent in the sense that there is a duality relating them. Today mirror symmetry is an active area of research in mathematics, and mathematicians <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>to</b> develop a more complete mathematical understanding of mirror symmetry based on physicists' intuition.|$|E
5|$|Sabah's public {{infrastructure}} {{are still}} lagged behind mostly {{due to its}} geographical challenges as the second largest state in Malaysia. The Sabah Ministry of Infrastructure Development (formerly known as Ministry of Communication and Works) is responsible for all public infrastructure planning and development in the state. To narrow the development gap, the federal government <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>to</b> build more infrastructures and improve the already available one. In 2013, Sabah state government allocates RM1.583billion for infrastructure and public facilities development, of which the state were allocated another RM4.07billion {{by the federal government}} in 2015 Malaysian Budget. Since the Eight Malaysia Plan (8MP) until 2014, a total of RM11.115billion has been allocated for various infrastructure projects in the state. Under the Tenth Malaysia Plan (10MP), infrastructure in the rural areas was given attention with the increase of rural water, electricity supply and road coverage.|$|E
5|$|The Tualatin Riverkeepers, {{a nonprofit}} {{watershed}} council based in Tigard; Clean Water Services, a public utility that protects water {{resources in the}} Tualatin River watershed, and the Tualatin Hills Park & Recreation District (THPRD) have formed the Tualatin Basin Invasive Species Working Group to identify and eradicate invasive plants that displace native plants, cause erosion, and diminish water quality. The five plants considered most threatening are Japanese knotweed, meadow knapweed, giant hogweed, garlic mustard and purple loosestrife. The Oregon Department of Agriculture {{and the city of}} Tigard <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>to</b> eradicate giant hogweed from lower Fanno Creek.|$|E

5|$|Part of the {{battlefield}} is now preserved in Princeton Battlefield State Park, which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961. Another section of {{the battlefield}} adjacent to the state park is embroiled in a development controversy. The Institute for Advanced Study, which owns the property, is planning a housing project on land where George Washington charged with his men during the battle. Historians, the Department of the Interior and archaeological evidence confirm the land's significance. Several national and local preservation organizations <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>to</b> prevent construction on the property, and the Princeton Battlefield Society had legal action pending as of summer 2016. On December 12, 2016, the Civil War Trust announced they will purchase almost 15 acres of land from the Institute for Advanced Study. Seven of the planned single family dwellings will be replaced with townhouses. In total, 16 housing units will be constructed. The compromise is subject to approval by the Princeton Planning Board and Delaware and Raritan Canal Commission.|$|E
5|$|Somerset is an {{important}} supplier of defence equipment and technology. A Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Bridgwater was built {{at the start of}} the Second World War, between the villages of Puriton and Woolavington, to manufacture explosives. The site was decommissioned and closed in July 2008. Templecombe has Thales Underwater Systems, and Taunton presently has the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office and Avimo, which became part of Thales Optics. It has been announced twice, in 2006 and 2007, that manufacturing is to end at Thales Optics' Taunton site, but the trade unions and Taunton Deane District Council <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>to</b> reverse or mitigate these decisions. Other high-technology companies include the optics company Gooch and Housego, at Ilminster. There are Ministry of Defence offices in Bath, and Norton Fitzwarren is the home of 40 Commando Royal Marines. The Royal Naval Air Station in Yeovilton, is one of Britain's two active Fleet Air Arm bases and is home to the Royal Navy's Lynx helicopters and the Royal Marines Commando Westland Sea Kings. Around 1,675 service and 2,000 civilian personnel are stationed at Yeovilton and key activities include training of aircrew and engineers and the Royal Navy's Fighter Controllers and surface-based aircraft controllers.|$|E
5|$|The Dayton region {{gave birth}} to {{aviation}} and {{is known for its}} high concentration of aerospace and aviation technology. In 2009, Governor Ted Strickland designated Dayton as Ohio's aerospace innovation hub, the state's first such technology hub. Two major United States research and development organizations have leveraged Dayton's historical leadership in aviation and maintain their headquarters in the area: The National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). NASIC is the U.S. military's primary producer of intelligence on foreign air and space forces, weapons, and systems, while the AFRL provides leading-edge warfighting capabilities. Both have their headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is one of the Air Force's largest air base wings. The installation generated a total economic impact in the Dayton area of $4.67billion in fiscal year 2011, a decline from $5.1billion in fiscal year 2009. In addition, state officials <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>to</b> make the Dayton region a hub and a leader for UAV research and manufacturing.|$|E
