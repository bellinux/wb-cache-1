Introducing a transgene coding for antisense RNA is a technique used to block expression of a gene of interest. Radioactively-labelled antisense RNA can be used to show the level of transcription of genes in various cell types.

40|$|Antisense-based {{molecules}} targeting HIV- 1 RNA {{have the}} potential to be used as part of gene or drug therapy to treat HIV- 1 infection. In this study, HIV- 1 RNA was screened to identify more conserved and accessible target sites for ribozymes based on the hepatitis delta virus motif. Using a quantitative screen for effects on HIV- 1 production, we identified a ribozyme targeting a highly conserved site in the Gag coding sequence with improved inhibitory potential compared to our previously described candidates targeting the overlapping Tat/Rev coding sequence. We also demonstrate that this target site is highly accessible to short hairpin directed RNA interference, suggesting that it may be available for the binding of antisense RNAs with different modes of action. We provide evidence that this target site is structurally conserved in diverse viral strains and that it is sufficiently different from the human transcriptome to limit off-target effects from <b>antisense</b> <b>therapies.</b> We also show that the modified hepatitis delta virus ribozyme is more sensitive to a mismatch in its target site compared to the short hairpin RNA. Overall, our results validate the potential of a new target site in HIV- 1 RNA to be used for the development of <b>antisense</b> <b>therapies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Epidermal {{growth factor}} {{receptor}} (EGFR) {{is a member}} of the ErbB family of receptors. Its stimulation by endogenous ligands, EGF or transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α) results in activation of intracellular tyrosine kinase, therefore, cell cycle progression. High levels of EGFR expression are correlated with poor prognosis and resistance to radiation therapy in a variety of cancers, mostly in squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Blocking the EGFR by a monoclonal antibody results in inhibition of the stimulation of the receptor, therefore, in inhibition of cell proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and reduced angiogenesis, invasiveness and metastases. The EGFR is a prime target for new anticancer therapy in SCCHN, and other agents in development include small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors and <b>antisense</b> <b>therapies.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Xeno{{nucleic acid}}s are {{synthetic}} nucleic acid analogues that are potential candidates for <b>antisense</b> or antigene <b>therapy</b> owing to their higher thermal and enzymatic stability {{compared to that}} of naturally occurring ones at physiological conditions. We investigate the binding and unzipping of xylonucleic acid (XNA) containing xylose (a stereoisomer of ribose) sugar in its backbone assisted by a single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) using extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations confirm XNA to undergo faster unzipping compared to a double stranded RNA with the same nucleobase sequence which is presumably due to the near orthogonal base pairing arrangement of the constituent nucleobases of XNA at physiologically relevant conditions (in terms of temperature and salt concentration). The interaction between XNA and SWCNT mimics that of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) and RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) during a typical RNA induced gene silencing process where the duplex chain unwinding of the siRNA is of primordial importance. Our study may find relevance in designing a more efficient and safer delivery platform for xenonucleic acids by grafting these RNA analogues to SWCNT into an infected target cell.

50|$|Synthetic peptide {{nucleic acid}} {{oligomers}} {{have been used in}} recent years in molecular biology procedures, diagnostic assays, and <b>antisense</b> <b>therapies.</b> Due to their higher binding strength {{it is not necessary to}} design long PNA oligomers for use in these roles, which usually require oligonucleotide probes of 20-25 bases. The main concern of the length of the PNA-oligomers is to guarantee the specificity. PNA oligomers also show greater specificity in binding to complementary DNAs, with a PNA/DNA base mismatch being more destabilizing than a similar mismatch in a DNA/DNA duplex. This binding strength and specificity also applies to PNA/RNA duplexes. PNAs are not easily recognized by either nucleases or proteases, making them resistant to degradation by enzymes. PNAs are also stable over a wide pH range. Though an unmodified PNA cannot readily cross cell membranes to enter the cytosol, covalently coupling a cell penetrating peptide to a PNA can improve cytosolic delivery.|$|R

40|$|Hutchinson-Gilford {{progeria}} syndrome (HGPS) {{is caused}} by a point mutation in the LMNA gene that activates a cryptic donor splice site and yields a truncated form of prelamin A called progerin. Small amounts of progerin are also produced during normal aging. Studies with mouse models of HGPS have allowed the recent development of the first therapeutic approaches for this disease. However, none of these earlier works have addressed the aberrant and pathogenic LMNA splicing observed in HGPS patients {{because of the lack of}} an appropriate mouse model. Here, we report a genetically modified mouse strain that carries the HGPS mutation.

5000|$|Oligonucleotides are {{characterized}} by the sequence of nucleotide residues {{that make up the}} entire molecule. The length of the oligonucleotide is usually denoted by [...] "-mer" [...] (from Greek meros, [...] "part").

Oligonucleotides readily bind, in a sequence-specific manner, to their respective complementary oligonucleotides, DNA, or RNA to form duplexes or, less often, hybrids of a higher order. This basic property serves as a foundation for the use of oligonucleotides as probes for detecting DNA or RNA.

40|$|Oligonucleotides {{containing}} 5 -(N-aminohexyl) carbamoyl-modified uracils have promising {{features for}} applications as antigene and <b>antisense</b> <b>therapies.</b> Relative to unmodified DNA, oligonucleotides containing 5 -(N-aminohexyl) carbamoyl- 2 ′-deoxyuridine (NU) or 5 -(N-aminohexyl) carbamoyl- 2 ′-O-methyluridine (NUm), respectively exhibit increased binding affinity for DNA and RNA, and enhanced nuclease resistance. To understand the structural implications of NU and NUm substitutions, we have determined the X-ray crystal structures of DNA:DNA duplexes containing either NU or NUm and of DNA:RNA hybrid duplexes containing NUm. The aminohexyl chains are fixed {{in the major}} groove through hydrogen bonds between the carbamoyl amino groups and the uracil O 4 atoms. The terminal ammonium cations on these chains could interact with the phosphate oxygen anions of the residues in the target strands. These interactions partly account for the increased target binding affinity and nuclease resistance. In contrast to NU, NUm decreases DNA binding affinity. This {{could be explained by}} the drastic changes in sugar puckering and in the minor groove widths and hydration structures seen in the NUm containing DNA:DNA duplex structure. The conformation of NUm, however, is compatible with the preferred conformation in DNA:RNA hybrid duplexes. Furthermore, the ability of NUm to render the duplexes with altered minor grooves may increase nuclease resistance and elicit RNase H activity...|$|R

Aberrant expression of the c-myc gene product has been observed {{in a range of}} tumours and has also been implicated in cisplatin (cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum) -mediated chemoresistance. A solid transplantable tumour model in syngeneic DA rats was subjected to treatment with cisplatin to determine the impact of such therapy on endogenous c-myc gene expression. Serially transplanted tumours were intravenously treated with a single cisplatin dose (1 mg/kg) and c-myc expression analysed 2 and 7 days after treatment. The surviving tumour cells display a significant 2 -fold elevation in c-myc expression at 48 h and 7 days after treatment. Primary cell cultures have been derived from untreated in vivo tumours of the same model and subjected to treatment with a c-myc phosphorothioate antisense oligomer. Administration of 5 microM c-myc antisense oligomer directed at the initiation codon and first four codons of c-myc mRNA results in total inhibition of c-myc expression and coincident suspension of cell growth for a period of 4 days in culture. <b>Antisense</b> <b>therapies</b> directed at the c-myc gene may well prove an effective tool for treating tumours in conjunction with cisplatin as these findings show that tumour cells surviving cisplatin chemotherapy display elevated c-myc expression...|$|R
50|$|If {{increased}} telomerase {{activity is}} associated with malignancy, then possible cancer treatments could involve inhibiting its catalytic component, hTERT, to reduce the enzyme’s activity and cause cell death. Since normal somatic cells do not express TERT, telomerase inhibition in cancer cells can cause senescence and apoptosis without affecting normal human cells. It {{has been found that}} dominant-negative mutants of hTERT could reduce telomerase activity within the cell. This led to apoptosis and cell death in cells with short telomere lengths, a promising result for cancer treatment. Although cells with long telomeres did not experience apoptosis, they developed mortal characteristics and underwent telomere shortening. Telomerase activity has also been found to be inhibited by phytochemicals such as isoprenoids, genistein, curcumin, etc. These chemicals play a role in inhibiting the mTOR pathway via down-regulation of phosphorylation. The mTOR pathway is very important in regulating protein synthesis and it interacts with telomerase to increase its expression. Several other chemicals have been found to inhibit telomerase activity and are currently being tested as potential clinical treatment options such as nucleoside analogues, retinoic acid derivatives, quinolone antibiotics, and catechin derivatives. There are also other molecular genetic-based methods of inhibiting telomerase, such as <b>antisense</b> <b>therapy</b> and RNA interference.|$|E

40|$|The {{improvement}} of non-viral-based gene delivery systems is of prime {{importance for the}} future of gene and <b>antisense</b> <b>therapies.</b> We have previously described a peptide-based gene delivery system, MPG, derived from the fusion peptide domain of HIV- 1 gp 41 protein and the nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) of SV 40 large T antigen. MPG forms stable non-covalent complexes with nucleic acids and improves their delivery. In the present work, we have investigated the mechanism through which MPG promotes gene delivery. We demonstrate that cell entry is independent of the endosomal pathway and that the NLS of MPG is involved in both electrostatic interactions with DNA and nuclear targeting. MPG/DNA particles interact with the nuclear import machinery, however, a mutation which affects the NLS of MPG disrupts these interactions and prevents nuclear delivery of DNA. Nevertheless, we show that this mutation yields a variant of MPG which is a powerful tool for delivery of siRNA into mammalian cells, enabling rapid release of the siRNA into the cytoplasm and promoting robust down-regulation of target mRNA. Taken together, these results support the potential of MPG-like peptides for therapeutic applications and suggest that specific variations in the sequence may yield carriers with distinct targeting features...|$|R

Primary cell cultures derived from 17 melanomas, the cell line A 375, and normal melanocytes from healthy donors were treated with antisense oligonucleotides targeting either the bcl-xL mRNA or the bcl- 2 and the bcl-xL mRNAs simultaneously. Bcl- 2 and bcl-xL expression in cells was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Cell viability was assessed in 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide and apoptosis assays. Bcl- 2 expression was low in melanoma cells of stages I, II, and III, hardly detectable in A 375 cells, but high in normal melanocytes. Bcl-xL expression was high in all cell types tested. As shown in A 375 cells and the stage III melanoma cells 0513, both the bcl-xL monospecific oligonucleotide 4259 and the bcl- 2 /bcl-xL bispecific oligonucleotide 4625 effectively reduced tumor cell viability by induction of apoptosis with IC 50 values ranging from 200 to 350 nM.

At present, transgenic expression of 12 human SOD 1 mutations driven by the endogenous promoter is disease-causative and uniformly lethal in mice and rats, despite tremendous biochemical and biophysical variation between the mutants tested. This contrasts with the subclinical motor neuron disease phenotypes of wild-type SOD 1 transgenic and knockout mice. Molecular mechanisms such as glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, axonal transport blockade, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation and apoptosis triggered by mutant SOD 1 catalysed oxidative reactions and/or protein misfolding are proposed to drive ALS pathogenesis. Around 100 genetic cross-breeding experiments with transgenic mutant SOD 1 mice have been performed to verify these mechanisms in vivo.
