5|$|Besides common {{avionics}} {{and computer}} systems, the 757 shares its <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit,</b> electric power systems, flight deck, and hydraulic parts with the 767. Through operational commonality, 757 pilots can obtain a common type rating {{to fly the}} 767 and share the same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft. This reduces costs for airlines that operate both twinjets.|$|E
5|$|Although the XCG-17 {{failed to}} lead to any {{production}} of a C-47 derived glider type, a single C-47 was converted {{in the field to}} glider configuration by the Fifth Air Service Area Command, located at Nichols Field on Luzon in the Philippines, during January 1946. Carried out in much the same manner as the XCG-17, the conversion included octagonally shaped fairings over the engine mountings, with an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> from a B-24 Liberator bomber being installed.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to shared avionics and computer technology, the 767 {{uses the same}} <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit,</b> electric power systems, and hydraulic parts as the 757. A raised cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows result in similar pilot viewing angles. Related design and functionality allows 767 pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate the 757 and share the same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Developed {{version of}} the B.1. Larger, thinner wing than the B.1 (Phase 2C wing) and fitted with Olympus 201-202 engines of 17,000 lbf (76 kN) each, or Olympus 301 engines of 20,000 lbf (89 kN) each. Uprated {{electrics}} with Auxiliary Airborne Power Plant (AAPP) (<b>Auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit)</b> and Ram Air Turbine (RAT). ECM similar to B.1A. Terrain-Following Radar (TFR) in nose thimble radome fitted to most aircraft in mid-60s. New Radar warning receiver aerials on tail fin giving it a square top from the mid-1970s.|$|E

5|$|The Victor B.2 {{featured}} a distinct {{change in the}} aircraft's engine arrangements; incorporated into the right wing root was a Blackburn Artouste airborne <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> (AAPU), effectively a small fifth engine. The AAPU was capable of providing high-pressure air for starting the main engines, and also providing electrical power {{on the ground or}} alternatively in the air as an emergency back-up in the event of main engine failures. The AAPU also acted to reduce the need for external specialist support equipment. Turbine-driven alternators, otherwise known as ram air turbines (RATs), had been introduced on the B.2 to provide emergency power in the event of electrical or hydraulic power being lost. Retractable scoops in the rear fuselage would open to feed ram air into the RATs, which would provide sufficient electrical power to operate the flight controls. In the event of engine flameout RATs would assist the crew in maintaining control of the aircraft until the main engines could be relit.|$|E
5|$|The {{airframe}} {{incorporates the}} use of composite materials, which comprise nine percent of its original structural weight (all models outside the 777-8 and 777-9). Elements made from composite material include the cabin floor and rudder. The main fuselage cross-section is circular and tapers rearward into a blade-shaped tail cone with a port-facing <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit.</b> The aircraft also features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner. The six-wheel bogies are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear. This helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircraft's braking and hydraulic systems. Each tire of a 777-300ER six-wheel main landing gear can carry a load of , which is heavier than other wide-bodies such as the 747-400. The aircraft has triple redundant hydraulic systems with only one system required for landing. A ram air turbine –a small retractable propeller which can provide emergency power– is also fitted in the wing root fairing.|$|E
5|$|The {{freighter}} {{features a}} large, upward-opening main deck cargo door on its forward port-side fuselage. Adjacent to this large cargo door is an exit door {{used by the}} pilots. All other emergency exits are omitted, and cabin windows and passenger amenities are not available. The main deck cargo hold has a smooth fiberglass lining, and a fixed rigid barrier with a sliding access door serves as a restraint wall next to the flight deck. Both lower holds can be equipped with a telescoping baggage system to load custom-fitted cargo modules. When equipped for extended-range transatlantic operations, UPS's 757-200PFs feature an upgraded <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit,</b> additional cargo bay fire suppression equipment, enhanced avionics, and an optional supplemental fuel tank in the aft lower hold. Total production for the 757-200PF totaled 80 aircraft.|$|E

5|$|During flight, the {{aircraft}} maintains a datalink with a satellite communication network for data and telephone calls. The datalink connects {{the aircraft}} and a ground station via satellite, which translates (changes) the signal's frequency and amplifies the signal; the ground station {{is connected to}} telecommunication networks which allows messages {{to be sent to}} and received from other locations, such as the airline's operations centre. Normal communications from Flight370 were last made at 1:07MYT and the datalink between the aircraft and satellite telecommunication network was lost at some point between 1:07 and 2:03, when the aircraft did not acknowledge a message sent from the ground station. Three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar coverage—at 2:25—the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) transmitted a log-on message, which investigators believe occurred as the SDU started after a power interruption. Between the 2:25 message and 8:19, the SDU acknowledged two ground-to-aircraft telephone calls, which were not answered, and responded to automated, hourly requests from the ground station that were made to determine whether the SDU was still active. None of the communications from 2:25–8:19 contain explicit information about the aircraft's location. The aircraft's final transmission at 8:19 was a log-on message; the aircraft did not respond to a message from the ground station at 9:15. Investigators believe the 8:19 log-on message was made when the SDU was restarting after the aircraft ran out of fuel and the aircraft's <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> was started.|$|E

25|$|The BAe 146 was {{the second}} {{aircraft}}, after the Concorde, to use carbon brakes. The aircraft features a low amount of composite material, used {{in parts of the}} secondary structure only. Initial production aircraft featured a conventional cockpit and manual flight controls. At launch, the onboard <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> (APU) consumed only half the fuel and weighed only a third as much as other contemporary models.|$|E
25|$|New engines {{offered on}} the 747-400 {{included}} the Pratt & Whitney PW4056, the General Electric CF6-80C2B1F, and the Rolls-Royce RB211-524G/H. The engines offered lower fuel consumption and greater thrust, {{along with a}} full-authority digital engine control (FADEC) which adjusted engine performance for improved efficiency compared with the Classic 747s. A new <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> (APU) manufactured by Pratt & Whitney Canada was also selected to provide on-ground power for the 747-400, with a 40 percent reduction in fuel consumption compared to previous APU designs.|$|E
25|$|Before the flight, {{the crew}} {{found that one}} of the two main power {{generators}} was defective since 6 September, and the mechanic who inspected the aircraft was unable to repair it. In the Norwegian jurisdiction an aircraft is only allowed to take off if it has two operable sources of power. Also the aircraft's Minimum Equipment List required two operating generators. The first officer decided that he would run the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> (APU) throughout the flight so that the flight would have two sources of power and therefore be allowed to leave.|$|E
50|$|The {{television}} {{equipment and}} transmitters were {{powered by a}} gas-turbine electrical power plant in the aft end of the DC-6 fuselage; equipment similar in design to <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> <b>units</b> later jet transport aircraft use for engine starting.|$|R
50|$|Smaller {{turbo-generators}} {{with gas}} turbines {{are often used}} as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> <b>units.</b> For base loads diesel generators are usually preferred, since they offer better fuel efficiency, but, on the other hand, diesel generators have a lower power density and hence, require more space.|$|R
