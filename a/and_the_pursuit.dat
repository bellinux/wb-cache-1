5|$|A federal {{government}} is only sensible, for Russell, when it has limited but well-defined powers.

On his view, the function of a world government should only be to ensure the avoidance of war <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> of peace (Russell 1938:230-31). On the world stage, democracy would be impossible, because of the negligible power any particular individual could have in comparison with the entire human race.|$|E

She claimed her eighth World Cup win at the mass start in Oberhof in January 2008, and later that month won the relay race in Ruhpolding with the German team. Shortly before her 21st birthday, Neuner decided to again compete at the Junior/Youth World Championships, held in Ruhpolding in January 2008—the last time she was {{eligible}} to enter.

5|$|Ford Australia's {{performance}} vehicle partner Ford Performance Vehicles {{produced a}} range of models based on the Falcon BA and marketed under the FPV name. The 2003 BA range included the GT, GT-P, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pursuit.</b> The GT was the entry-level vehicle that started with a suggested retail price of A$59,810. The GT-P was the upmarket version of the GT, with a price tag of A$69,850. The Pursuit was a ute (utility) version of the GT, featuring the same seats, basic dash/interior package and wheels. FPV specific body-kits were applied to all cars, using the lights from the XR-range. The kit had a strong resemblance to the BA Falcon V8 Supercar, highlighting the connection to FPR.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Neuner hinted the {{upcoming}} season might be her last. She began the winter in Östersund with the best season start of her career, beating Tora Berger by 0.2 seconds in the sprint to claim her 25th World Cup win. She also came third in the individual <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pursuit,</b> and took the yellow bib of the Overall World Cup leader. On 6 December 2011, Neuner announced her retirement from biathlon {{by the end of the}} season on her homepage. She explained her early departure from the sport (at age 25) with a lack of motivation and her desire for a normal life. Neuner nonetheless continued her good form in Hochfilzen, where she claimed her 26th World Cup win in the sprint.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1863, the XII Corps was {{transferred}} to the West to reinforce the Union forces besieged at Chattanooga. At the Battle of Wauhatchie, during a surprise night attack by the Confederate forces, Greene was wounded in the face, with his jaw crushed and some teeth carried away. Subsequent surgery was not able to correct his condition and he suffered from the effects of his wound {{for the rest of his}} life. After six weeks of medical leave, he was assigned to light court-martial duty until January 1865, when he was sent to join Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's army in North Carolina. Initially Greene voluntarily served on the staff of Maj. Gen. Jacob D. Cox participating in the battle at Kinston, where he had his horse shot out from under him. At the very end of the war Greene was in command of the 3rd Brigade in Absalom Baird's 3rd Division, XIV Corps, and participated in the capture of Raleigh <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's army until its surrender.|$|E

By {{the end of}} 21 July, the corps arrived to assist the 12th Tank Corps and the 91st Separate Tank Brigade in the crossing of the Optushka River, delayed by intense German air attacks and tank counterattacks. On the next morning, all three units began crossing the river. The 195th Tank Brigade's commander, Vasily Lomakin, was killed in action while leading his unit on 22July. Both Chigin and Lomakin were posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. On 23 July, the German defenses on the Optushka were broken, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> began. By {{the end of the}} day, the corps had reached the line of Semendyaevsky, Karpovsky, Aleksandrovka, Safonovo, and Neplyuevo.|$|E
5|$|With the {{establishment}} of a dynastic union with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1386, it became customary to use two bannersPolish and Lithuanianas equally important insignia of royal authority. In the mid-16th century, before the creation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (real union) in 1569, a single banner for the entire entity also came into use. The Commonwealth banner was initially plain white emblazoned with the arms of the Commonwealth which combined the heraldic charges of Poland (White Eagle) and Lithuania (Pursuer). During the 17th century, the banner was often divided into three or four horizontal stripes of white and red, ending with swallowtails. Elective kings' dynastic arms were often placed in an inescutcheon. Variants with the White Eagle and the Pursuer placed side by side without an escutcheon directly in the field or with the Eagle on the obverse <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pursuit</b> on the reverse side of the banner were also used.|$|E
