5|$|The Ingenuity Gap is a non-fiction book by Canadian {{academic}} Thomas Homer-Dixon. It {{was written}} {{over the course}} of eight years from 1992 to 2000 when it was published by Knopf. The book argues that the nature of problems faced by our society are becoming more complex <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> ability to implement solutions is not keeping pace. Homer-Dixon focuses upon complexities, unexpected non-linear results, and emergent properties. He takes an inter-disciplinary approach connecting political science with sociology, economics, history, and ecology.|$|E

Circlework uses circle gatherings to create a field of open-heartedness and love powerful enough to heal individuals and communities. Circlework {{is based on the}} assumption that the root causes of violence and war lie within us, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> own consciousness is where change must begin.|$|E

He acknowledges that sometimes the senses can deceive, but only with respect to objects that are very small or far away, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> sensory knowledge on the whole is quite sturdy. The Meditator acknowledges that insane people might be more deceived, but that he is clearly not one of them and needn't worry himself about that.|$|E

25|$|Turkle's main {{argument}} {{in the first part}} of the book is that our interactions with robots that simulate emotion pose serious threats to our ability to relate to one another properly. Turkle discusses robots that have been designed to interact with humans on an emotional level; she fears that they may then replace other humans and animals in these emotional roles. Turkle is concerned that we often attribute certain qualities to robots that the robots do not in fact possess, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> emotional interactions with other humans become eroded as a direct result. Turkle's concern is that our appreciation for human interaction may become eroded.|$|E

500|$|Craig Stanford, Professor of Biological Sciences and Anthropology at the University of Southern California, {{gave the}} book a {{generally}} positive review in American Scientist, but offered critique {{by suggesting that}} [...] "f there is a flaw in this tightly written, insightful book, it is that Wade provides perhaps {{too many of the}} stock examples of human evolution. In my view, he spends too much time and space attempting to convince the reader that we did indeed evolve from apes (duh!) <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> own social behavior and cognition have roots in the deep human past." [...] Peter Dizikes of The New York Times also gave a mostly positive review, calling it a [...] "timely and informative survey." [...] However, he criticised Wade's claim that [...] "the development of lactose tolerance shows broadly that 'genes respond to cultural changes'", and posited the alternative view that it is [...] "a case of genes responding to an environmental change produced by society – the abundance of milk-producing cattle – and not to any abstract cultural practice." [...] Dizikes also took issue with Wade's use of the word [...] "race", saying that the [...] "judgment that these regional genetic tendencies constitute 'races' has no deep scientific rationale, either. Such labels are generalizations situated atop a complicated intermingling of populations." ...|$|E
500|$|Manners {{noted that}} [...] "Closure" [...] {{was one of}} the first episodes in which the {{production}} staff was able to [...] "shoot in Los Angeles with the sun out". According to Manners, the show was struggling with the fact that [...] "we weren't in Vancouver anymore <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> show had suddenly become very bright and cheery". To amend this, Bill Roe, director of photography, used tree branches and c-stands to block out the sunlight. [...] The first scene with the walk-ins rising up from their grave, shot at Griffith Park above the playground, was [...] "tricky," [...] according to director Kim Manners. Manners felt uncomfortable telling the children to rise out of [...] "graves", feeling it could psychologically hurt them, so instead the crew called the holes in the ground [...] "forts." [...] The scenes taking place at April Air Force Base was shot in San Bernardino, California at a closed airfield, the former Norton Air Force Base. On the airbase was a large abandoned house complex of over 400 buildings constructed and used by the United States military. [...] According to Manners, the entire area was [...] "eerie", and many of the houses still had furniture in them. Originally, the producers wanted to name the fictitious air force March Air Force Base. However, the presence of an actual air force base with the same name necessitated a change to April Air Force Base. One of the shots in the April Air Force Base was filmed at a sound stage in Los Angeles. The scene at the restaurant was shot in a location on Sepulveda Boulevard, at a hotel that had been standing there for 30 to 40 years.|$|E

2500|$|Epiphenomenon / zombie reply: Several {{philosophers}} {{argue that}} consciousness, as Searle describes it, does not exist.

2500|$|The {{developmental}} psychologist Erik Erikson {{wrote of}} an epigenetic principle {{in his book}} , encompassing {{the notion that we}} develop through an unfolding of our personality in predetermined stages, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> environment and surrounding culture influence how we progress through these stages. This biological unfolding in relation to our socio-cultural settings is done in stages of psychosocial development, where [...] "progress through each stage is in part determined by our success, or lack of success, in all the previous stages." ...|$|E

Reddy showed, for a single, very significant case, that the locus of metaphor is thought, not language, that metaphor is a major and indispensable part of our ordinary, conventional way of conceptualizing the world, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> everyday behavior reflects our metaphorical understanding of experience. Though other theorists had noticed some of these characteristics of metaphor, Reddy was the first to demonstrate them by rigorous linguistic analysis, stating generalizations over voluminous examples." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{not until}} February 1955 did another {{official}} reason for the M.52's cancellation emerge; a white paper issued that month stated that [...] "the decision was also taken in 1946 that, {{in light of the}} limited knowledge then available, the risk of attempting supersonic flight in manned aircraft was unacceptable high <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> research into the problems involved should be conducted in the first place by means of air launched models". This same paper acknowledged that the termination decision had seriously delayed the advancement of aeronautical progress by Britain. It has since been widely recognised that the cancellation of the M.52 was a major setback in British progress in the field of supersonic design.|$|E

2500|$|Some see Schopenhauer's {{account of}} the Will as closely {{resembling}} classic examples of Monism. [...] Schopenhauer also developed some ideas {{that can be found}} in the theory of evolution, before Darwin began to publish his work, for example the idea that all life strives to preserve itself and to engender new life, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> mental faculties are merely tools to that end. However, he saw species as fixed. His respect for the rights of animals – including a vehement opposition to vivisection – has led many modern animal rights activists to find in him a precursor of their positions. He thought of animals and humans as both being objectifications of the same underlying Will.|$|E
2500|$|On July 17, President Bill Clinton {{spoke with}} Kennedy's sister, Caroline, and later called his uncle, Ted. Clinton also spoke with Andrew Cuomo, {{who at the}} time was married to Kennedy's cousin, Kerry. [...] "He wanted to let them know he was {{thinking}} about them, that we'll do everything we can, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> prayers are with them", Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart said. Clinton ordered warships of the U.S. Navy to assist in the search for Kennedy's plane. Critics argued that the search was an abuse of taxpayer dollars, as no ordinary citizen would receive similar treatment. Clinton said that afternoon that the Kennedys had [...] "suffered much, and given more", and also called for them to feel [...] "the strength of God, the love of their friends and the prayers of their fellow citizens".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{fundamentalist}} {{critics have}} joined liberals in referring to Barth as [...] "neo-orthodox" [...] because, while his theology retains {{most or all}} of the tenets of their understanding of Christianity, he is seen as rejecting the belief which is a linchpin of their theological system: biblical inerrancy. Such critics believe the written text must be considered to be historically accurate and verifiable and see Barth's view as a separation of theological truth from historical truth. Barth could respond by saying that the claim that the foundation of theology is biblical inerrancy is to use a foundation other than Jesus Christ, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> understanding of Scripture's accuracy and worth can only properly emerge from consideration of what it means for it to be a true witness to the incarnate Word, Jesus.|$|E
