40|$|Historically, the Savannah River Site, {{like many}} Department of Energy sites, has used some {{multiple}} {{of the expected}} Derived Air Concentration (DAC) of a radionuclide as a suspension guide for Radiological Work Permits (RWP) or validation of selected respiratory protection equipment. The term DAC expresses the concentration of a radionuclide in air, typically in mCi/cc. Even though the term DAC is derived from an intake of radioactivity (<b>Annual</b> <b>Limit</b> <b>on</b> <b>Intake)</b> {{that would result in}} defined estimated dose to a worker, knowing only the DAC value does not allow a worker's potential dose to be determined. Recently, the Savannah Rive Site has converted to the use of DAC-hours for RWP suspension guides and respiratory equipment validation. The term DAC-hr takes into account not only the concentration of the radionuclide in air (DAC) but also the time the individual was exposed allowing an estimate of a worker's dose to be determined. The conversion to DAC-hrs resulted in four benefits to the radiation protection program without increasing the risk to workers; (1) consistency with the constant air monitor (CAM) alarm setpoint protocol; (2) consistency with Internal Dosimetry terminology; (3) an a priori determination of the potential risk to a worker; and (4) reduced complexity/error in field calculations. This paper outlines the justification for the conversion to DAC-hrs, the protocols used for field and count room calculations, and the implementation process utilized at the Savannah River Sit...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued a series of Federal {{guidance}} documents for the purpose of providing the Federal and State agencies with technical information to assist their implementation of radiation protection programs. Currently recommended dose conversion factors, <b>annual</b> <b>limits</b> <b>on</b> <b>intake,</b> and derived air concentrations for intake of radionuclides are tabulated in Federal Guidance Report No. 11 (FGR 11), published in 1988. The tabulations in FGR 11 were based on dosimetric quantities and biokinetic and dosimetric models of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) developed for application to occupational exposures. Since the publication of FGR 11 the ICRP has revised some of its dosimetric quantities and its models for workers and has also developed age-specific models and dose conversion factors for intake of radionuclides by members of the public.

40|$|The University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) Transmutation Research Program {{has been}} tasked to support U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) efforts {{to assess the}} health risks {{associated}} with the operation of each of their accelerator-driven nuclear facilities for both NEPA and PSAR development. Quantifying the radiological risks to workers {{will have to be}} addressed during the design and siting of each of these facilities. U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Federal Guidance Report No. 11 “Limiting Values of Intake and Air Concentration and Dose Conversion Factors for Inhalation, Submersion, and Ingestion”, developed two derived guides, <b>Annual</b> <b>Limit</b> <b>on</b> <b>Intake</b> (ALI) and the Derived Air Concentration (DAC), to be used to control radiation exposure in the workplace. The ALI is the annual intake of a radionuclide which would result in a committed effective dose equivalent of 0. 05 Sv/yr for stochastic effects, or a committed dose equivalent to an individual organ or tissue of 0. 5 Sv/yr for deterministic effects, to Reference Man (ICRP 1975). A DAC is that concentration of a radionuclide in air which, if breathed by Reference Man for a work-year, would result in an intake corresponding to its ALI (EPA 1988). Therefore, ALIs and DACs can be used for assessing radiation doses due to accidental ingestion and inhalation of radionuclides and are used for limiting radionuclide intake through breathing of, or submersion in, contaminated air. It is the intent of the current research to implement the methodology developed {{in the first year of}} the research and generate internal and external dose coefficients for radionuclides produced in spallation neutron sources. Results from this study will expand the ALI and DAC data of Federal Guidance Report No. 11 in order to include radionuclides produced by current technology, such as that used in the AAA and SNS programs...|$|E
40|$|The ICRP has {{published}} two biokinetic models providing {{a basis for}} radiation dose assessment due toradionuclides incorporated inside the gastrointestinal tract. These models are a sufficient tool to assess the committed dose equivalent for occupational exposures to workers assuming normal anatomy. The colostomy is becoming a more prevalent procedure. A colostomy permanently or temporarily bypasses a portion of colon to allow rest and healing. There are four different colostomies; ascending, transverse, descending and sigmoid and an ileostomy. As a patient’s strength returns, they can return to normal daily activities, including returning to work. Therefore, as an ostomy patient returns to the workforce handling radioactive material, the potential for exposure to the radioactive material for these workers increases. The aim of this project is to determined whether or not an additional risk exists for these workers and if additional limitations {{should be placed on}} ostomy patients handling uranium. In order to determine if an additional risk exists two pathways are considered, ingestion and injection. Injection is a unique pathway for this work and is defined as radioactive material entering through the stoma. As part of the injection scenario {{as well as in the}} event contamination occurs, the dose per hou to the stoma was also determined. Using modified ICRP 30 gastrointestinal models and ICRP 100 HATM models to reflect the anatomy changes for each procedure, the committed dose equivalent (CDE) and committed effective dose equivalent (CEDE) was determined for each procedure. In addition, using the more limiting value between the CDE and CEDE annual limit, the <b>annual</b> <b>limit</b> <b>on</b> <b>intake</b> (ALI) was determined. Based on a decrease in CDE values within the alimentary tract for each procedure and the determination the ALIs were either equivalent or orders of magnitude greater than the current ICRP ALI values no additional risk exists. Finally, based on the dose per hour resulting from stoma contamination, the chemical hazards were determined to be of greater concern than the radiological. Therefore, no additional guidance is needed for ostomy patients working with uranium...|$|E

40|$|Inter{{national}} {{and national}} regulations and guidelines pertinent to human exposure to plutonium {{and to other}} radioactive substances are summarized in Table 8 - 1. Recommendations for radiation protection {{for people in the}} general population as a result of exposure to radiation in the environment are found in the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Publication 60 (ICRP 1991). National guidelines for occupational radiation protection are found in the "Federal Radiation Protection Guidance for Occupational Exposure " (EPA 1987). The guidance presents general principles for the radiation protection of workers and specifies the numerical primary guides for limiting occupational exposure. These recommendations are consistent with the ICRP (ICRP 1991). The basic philosophy of radiation protection is the concept of ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable). ALARA requires that social and economic factors to be taken into consideration, and that further reductions in dose are not indicated where the costs of reducing exposure become disproportionate to the benefit achieved. As a rule, all exposure should be kept as low as reasonably achievable and the regulations and guidelines are meant to give an upper limit to exposure.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays examining the effects of high-skilled immigration on various economic outcomes within the receiving country. In the first essay, I study how skilled immigrants affect wages and employment in US industries during 1995 - 2007, using novel microdata on approved H- 1 B visas. These data show that most H- 1 B employers specialize {{in the production of}} high-skilled services used as inputs by other businesses. In light of this, I consider the downstream effects of skilled immigrants on industry labor market outcomes: how wages and employment in an industry respond to immigration shocks to its suppliers. The identification strategy relies on large policy changes to the <b>annual</b> <b>limit</b> <b>on</b> H- 1 B admissions. I find that higher admissions lead to higher mean wages in exposed downstream industries. Also rising with downstream exposure are the wages of high-skilled, STEM, and low-skilled workers, and the employment of high-skilled and STEM workers. These findings indicate that higher admissions increase average wages by increasing worker compensation but also by changing the composition of employment in exposed industries. While immigration status is not observable in my data, my estimates suggest that higher admissions benefit US native workers because exposed downstream sectors hire few immigrants. ^ In the second essay, I use the administrative data mentioned above to examine how skilled immigrants affect the employment prospects of young skilled natives in US states during 2000 - 2009. My identification strategy uses a decline in the supply of visas to a state caused by (1) changes in national immigration policy, and (2) tougher competition in the market for visas as demand by the largest H- 1 B employer increased dramatically. I show robust evidence that increased hiring of skilled foreign workers lowers employment of young college-educated natives. Consistent with previous work, I find no effect on total college-educated employment. ^ In the last chapter, I consider how rising skilled immigration during 1995 - 2007 affected service offshoring in US industries. Using the H- 1 B microdata, I document a large increase in the employment of skilled immigrants in tradeable service sectors during 1995 - 2007. Because skilled immigration may be endogenous to offshoring, I develop instruments that use variation in H- 1 B inflows that depend <b>on</b> (1) the <b>annual</b> <b>limit</b> <b>on</b> H- 1 B admissions set by government policy and (2) US macroeconomic conditions. These national shocks have differential effects across industries because some industries are always more exposed to skilled immigration than others. I find that higher skilled immigrant flows lead to higher offshoring in highly exposed industries. ...|$|R
