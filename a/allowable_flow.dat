40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{problems}} in the Northern U.

To identify these possible problem areas, a toolbar using GIS 9. 1 is being developed. This toolbar will execute two tasks.

The water distribution system undertaken for study represents a community where the water consumption is projected to grow 30 % in 15 years. Increasing consumption requires that the water system be improved to move water from sources into the growing areas. The criteria for enhancing the system capacity include satisfying the pressure requirement, the maximum <b>allowable</b> <b>flow</b> velocity and sufficient tank storage.

40|$|A {{number of}} methods exist {{that can be}} used to create {{simulation}} models for measuring the performance of computer networks. The most commonly used method is packet level simulation, which models the detailed behavior of every packet in the network, and results in a highly accurate picture of overall network behavior. A less frequently used, but sometimes more computationally efficient, method is the fluid model approach. In this method, aggregations of flows are modeled as fluid flowing through pipes, and queues are modeled as fixed capacity buckets. The buckets are connected via pipes, where the maximum <b>allowable</b> <b>flow</b> rate of fluid in the pipes represents the bandwidth of the communication links being modeled. Fluid models generally result in a less accurate picture of the network’s behavior since they rely on aggregation of flows and ignore actions specific to individual flows. We introduce a new hybrid simulation environment that leverages the strong points of each of these two modeling methods. Our hybrid method uses fluid models to represent aggregations of flows for which less detail is required, and packet models to represent individual flows for which more detail is needed. The result is a computationally efficient simulation model that results in a high level of accuracy and detail in some of the flows, while abstracting away details of other flows. We show a computational speedup of more than twenty in some cases, with little reduction in accuracy of the simulation results. ...|$|E

30|$|Figure  12 {{shows the}} raw data {{collected}} from 30 % watercut test. The plot {{can be divided into}} four zones. The first zone (Zone I) is pre-hydrate formation and mainly involves cooldown and pressure maintenance. The second zone (Zone II) is the hydrate formation and gas addition zone which starts from hydrate formation onset (HFO) and ends when gas is cutoff. The third zone (Zone III) is the stabilization zone during which no gas is added but hydrate formation continues until pressure stabilizes or decreases by less than 25 psi in an hour. The last zone (Zone IV) is speed ramping zone during which rheological data is collected. Data on this plot starts 0.25  h before hydrate formation onset. Data recorded includes pressure (psia), shaft speed (rpm), gas flow rates (ml/min), vessel temperature (°F) and shaft torque (N cm). Data collected from Zone I may be used to correlate the carrier fluid viscosity to parameters such as watercut, gas oil ratio (GOR), temperature and oil API. This work is ongoing at The University of Tulsa. HFO marks the start Zone II. HFO was observed at 42  °F and was accompanied by pressure decrease, temperature increase due to exothermic nature of hydrate formation, and torque increase capturing changes in viscosity. HFO leads to gas consumption from the flow mixtures which results in “dead” oil–water mixture momentarily triggering spikes in torque. This is a transient mass transfer phenomenon and should not be interpreted as viscosity change. The gas flow meter was set to provide gas to the system at a rate up to 1000 ml/min to maintain pressure at 1100 psi. So during cooling gas was added at a low flow rates to compensate for volume shrinkage due to temperature decrease. However, at HFO gas flow rate jumped to the maximum <b>allowable</b> <b>flow</b> rate of 1000 ml/min. This meant that if the gas consumption due hydrate formation was higher that gas flow rate then system pressure would decrease. And when hydrate formation slowed down, system pressure would be maintained at 1100 psi. Data collected in Zone II is useful when modeling the transient behavior or system response during hydrate formation. During zone III, the vessel temperature approached the jacket temperature, vessel pressure decreased to a new value close to 850 psi, and torque stabilized. During this zone, hydrate formation continues. Generally, torque increases due to formation of more hydrates and gas consumption both of which lead to increase in slurry viscosity. Shaft speed ramps are performed in Zone IV. It should be noted that torque responded proportionally to shaft speed changes confirming that the slurry generated in this test were mostly dispersed. Also, the torque observed at 600  rpm at the end of Zone IV was close to the value observed {{at the start of the}} zone suggesting little to no yield stress.|$|E

This paper studies the influence of information flow topology on the internal stability and scalability of homogeneous vehicular platoons moving in a rigid formation.

Directed graphs are adopted to describe different types of <b>allowable</b> information <b>flow</b> interconnecting vehicles, including both radar-based sensors and vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) communications. Under linear feedback controllers, a unified internal stability theorem is proved by using the algebraic graph theory and Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion.

Using matrix eigenvalue analysis, the scalability is investigated for platoons under two typical information flow topologies, i. e., 1) the stability margin of platoon decays to zero as 0 (1 /N 2) for bidirectional topology; and 2) the stability margin is always bounded and independent of the platoon size for bidirectional-leader topology.

In Japan, SHASE-S 218 (Heating, Air-Conditioning, and Sanitary Standard) stipulates the evaluation standard for drainage capability.

One is that pressure in the pipe should fall within ± 400 Pa, and the other is that the seal loss should be less than 25 mm. Nevertheless, recent studies revealed that the connecting of traps attenuates pneumatic pressure in pipes and causes a tendency of the power spectrum distribution to change. This phenomenon may be attributable to the fact that seal water vibration is a response phenomenon to pneumatic pressure vibration, and that they affect each other.

Reuse of runoff water decreases {{the amount of water}} that needs to be pumped or delivered and can be used to improve water application efficiency. It also reduces the possibility of pollution of natural streams from irrigated land. Other benefits are reduced surface drainage costs, improved weed control and the saving of irrigation labor. Reuse systems are readily adapted to automation and can be used advantageously in modern Labor-saving, automated and semi-automated irrigation systems. The economic value of runoff water will usually be the deciding factor in installing a recirculating irrigation system. However, in some areas run-off may be prohibited by law and recirculation is then mandatory. Where water is relatively expensive, such as water pumped from wells or where the supply is limited, reuse of runoff water may result in a more economical irrigation operation. Reuse of irrigation runoff water may be more economical than the use of additional labor to accomplish efficient irrigation by surface methods. Where runoff water is recycled, most of the diverted or pumped irrigation water will infiltrate the soil.

Designers rely on standards to derate <b>allowable</b> current <b>flow</b> to prevent exceedance of wire temperature limits due to resistive heat dissipation within the wires or wire bundles. These standards often add considerable margin and are based on empirical data. Commercial providers are taking an aggressive approach to wire sizing which challenges the conventional wisdom of the established standards. Thermal modelling of wire bundles may offer significant mass reduction in a system if the technique can be generalized to produce reliable temperature predictions for arbitrary bundle configurations. Thermal analysis {{has been applied to}} the problem of wire bundles wherein any or all of the wires within the bundle may carry current. Wire bundles present analytical challenges because the heat transfer path from conductors internal to the bundle is tortuous, relying on internal radiation and thermal interface conductance to move the heat from within the bundle to the external jacket where it can be carried away by convective and radiative heat transfer. The problem is further complicated by the dependence of wire electrical resistivity on temperature. Reduced heat transfer out of the bundle leads to higher conductor temperatures and, hence, increased resistive heat dissipation. Development of a generalized wire bundle thermal model is presented and compared with test data. The steady state heat balance for a single wire is derived and extended to the bundle configuration. The generalized model includes the effects of temperature varying resistance, internal radiation and thermal interface conductance, external radiation and temperature varying convective relief from the free surface.

The results of the study provide conclusive evidence of the superiority of the first-in-first-out priority rule for the mean tardiness criterion. However, for the number of tardy jobs criterion, clear superiority of a particular priority rule is not established.

The published article is copyrighted by Springer {{and can be found}} at: [URL] Walla Walla Basin, in Eastern Oregon and Washington, USA, faces challenges in sustaining an agricultural water supply while maintaining sufficient flow in the Walla Walla River for endangered fish populations. Minimum summer river flow of 0. 71 m³/s is required, forcing irrigators to substitute groundwater from a declining aquifer for lost surface water diversion. Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) was initiated in 2004 attempting to restore groundwater levels and improve agricultural viability. The Integrated Water Flow Model (IWFM) was used to compute surface and shallow groundwater conditions in the basin under water management scenarios with varying water use, MAR, and <b>allowable</b> minimum river <b>flow.</b> A mean increase of 1. 5 m of groundwater elevation, or 1. 5 % of total aquifer storage, was predicted over the model area when comparing maximum MAR and no MAR scenarios where minimum river flow was increased from current level. When comparing these scenarios a 53 % greater summer flow in springs was predicted with the use of MAR. Results indicate MAR can supplement irrigation supply while stabilizing groundwater levels and increasing summer streamflow. Potential increase in long-term groundwater storage is limited by the high transmissivity of the aquifer material. Increased MAR caused increased groundwater discharge through springs and stream beds, benefiting aquatic habitat rather than building long-term aquifer storage.

40|$|Renal {{failure or}} kidney failure {{is a medical}} {{condition}} when the kidneys fail to filter toxins and waste products from the blood. Most of the time, problems encountered in kidney malfunction include abnormal fluid levels in the body, increased acid levels and abnormal levels of Urea, Glucose, Endothelin, β 2 -Microglobulin, Complement Factor D. In medicine, dialysis is a method {{that is used to}} remove waste products from blood when the kidneys {{are in a state of}} renal failure. Parameters characterizing the structure of dialyzers are very important because they decide overall clearance of toxin molecules and at the same time should allow retaining useful molecules in the blood. It is however not clear how the changes of dialyzer parameters will affect the clearance. This can be found out by doing simulation of a dialysis process. In this thesis, a numerical model was developed to simulate the process that goes on inside a dialyzer to determine which parameters are important for getting better clearance of toxin molecules and how the changes of those parameters can improve the performance of dialysis. In order to do that, a model of dialyzer membrane with details of the porosity is necessary. The dialyzer membrane that was considered in this research was Polyflux 210 H. Here the cross sectional images of Polyflux 210 H dialyzer membrane were taken by FESEM (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope) to obtain the porosity values of different layers. Using these porosity values, a multilayered membrane model was developed in Finite Element Software- COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 3. Then a blood flow containing - Urea, Glucose, Endothelin, β 2 -Microglobulin, Complement Factor D and Albumin was introduced. For a certain blood flow rate the toxins diffuse through the membrane and on the other side of the membrane a dialysate flow was introduced to remove the toxins. Two different definitions of effective diffusivity were considered for the phenomenon of the diffusion of the molecules in the membrane. Between the two, the better definition was found out by comparing the results with experimental data of the manufacturer of Polyflux 210 H. Then for the chosen definition, further analysis was done and the results were compared with another set of experimental data to validate the model. Then different parameters - magnitude and direction of both blood and dialysate flow, length and diameter of the fiber, pore sizes were changed to simulate how these changes affect toxin clearance and the removal of useful molecules. The results suggest some very interesting points to achieve better dialysis performance. First of all, the clearance rate of both Urea and Glucose increase rapidly with the increasing blood flow rate. When a maximum <b>allowable</b> blood <b>flow</b> rate is attained, increasing the dialysate flow rate can ensure better clearance rate for Urea and Glucose. In both the cases of increasing radius or length of the dialyzer fiber, the clearance rate of Glucose increases more rapidly than the clearance rate of Urea. For Endothelin and β 2 -Microglobulin the clearance rate increases twice compared to the initial condition. Meanwhile, the clearance rate of Albumin does not change that much. Also increasing the pore diameter up to 20 nm (but not more than that) can ensure higher clearance rate of Urea and Glucose, moderate clearance rate of middle molecules and minimum loss of Albumin...|$|R
