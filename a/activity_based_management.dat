40|$|This {{essay is}} a {{literature}} study of Business modelling, it includes three methods; <b>Activity</b> <b>based</b> <b>management,</b> Theory of constraints and Business process management. Business modelling {{is the use}} of models and methods to understand and change organisations. The intentions to use business modelling as a tool are to close the gap between the people in the organisation and facilitate the communication, which often is a source that creates problems. One of the tools in Business modelling is Meta-modelling or method modelling that helps to analyse the possible connections between different methods. <b>Activity</b> <b>based</b> <b>management</b> focuses on directing activities to the goal instead of the more conventional way to direct the resources. In this essay is <b>Activity</b> <b>based</b> <b>management</b> discussed on a strategic development level. The other two are on process development level. Theory of constraints contains three separate but interrelated areas to increase the capacity; logistics, performance measurement and logical thinking. The increase of capacity will be reached by better planning with focus on the bottlenecks so that they will be as busy as possible; the company has to reduce the idle time at the bottlenecks that are caused by operations earlier in the workflow.

40|$|The paper uses object based {{models to}} capture and make visible the system level {{coordination}} structure of complex projects. These models facilitate {{the development of a}} shared view necessary for effective project management. In the paper, development and use of the models are illustrated using examples drawn from the design of custom silicon. We examine three custom silicon design projects to identify the significant coordination problems encountered as well as the difficulties of using <b>activity</b> <b>based</b> project <b>management</b> tools. Then we develop object based models of coordination structure as a tool to overcome these difficulties. We use these models to capture a project manager's view of the four stages of the custom silicon design cycle: design definition, chip design, prototype manufacture, and system integration. We conclude by discussing the relationship between the coordination structure approach and other project management tools, and the managerial advantages of the proposed approach in the management of projects. Because of their simplicity and stability, coordination structure models form a useful front-end for conventional <b>activity</b> <b>based</b> project <b>management.</b> The approach has particular value for the management of projects in which the task structure is complex, uncertain and unstable, as is typically the case in new product development.

40|$|The main {{content of}} the chapter is the {{application}} of <b>Activity</b> <b>Based</b> Costing techniques to banking sector. After the introduction, in the second paragraph {{the importance of a}} correct cost measurement in banks is illustrated. From one hand, the worsening of competitive pressures requires an improvement in bank efficiency; from the other hand, the use of cost information are many: profitability measurement, product mix decisions, resource allocation decisions, investment evaluation, strategic and tactical pricing, managerial accounting, planning and control, process improvement, managerial evaluation, etc. Notwithstanding the importance of cost information, the most widespread techniques of cost accounting in banks are weak. The main problem regards the indirect operating costs. A numerical example, referring to a simplified bank branch, shows the negative effects of the most common techniques: single-parameter cost allocation. The effects are mistaken profitability measurement, cross subsidisation between products, customers and branches, and consequent wrong decisions and corrective actions. In the third paragraph, the innovative <b>activity</b> <b>based</b> costing technique is explained. Its application at the same case-study, shows how the knowledge about indirect cost absorption is improved, the effective profitability of different branches is assessed, and the right actions can be adopted. The fourth paragraph illustrates the passage from (<b>activity</b> <b>based)</b> cost accounting to (<b>activity</b> <b>based)</b> cost <b>management.</b> New (<b>activity</b> <b>based)</b> information about costs are added and this allows the management of costs, the improvement of costs performance and the control of cost functions (service units).
