The total cost of the clearance framework for <b>a</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>member,</b> called CCVA for central clearing valuation adjustment, is decomposed into a CVA corresponding to the cost of its losses on the default fund in case of defaults of other member, an MVA corresponding to the cost of funding its margins and a KVA corresponding to the cost of the regulatory capital and also of the capital at risk that the member implicitly provides to the CCP through its default fund contribution. In the end the structure of the XVA equations for bilateral and cleared portfolios is similar, but the input data to these equations are not the same, reflecting different financial network structures. The resulting XVA numbers differ, but, interestingly enough, they become comparable after scaling by a suitable netting ratio...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{trigonometric}} parallax and distance {{for a young}} planetary mass object. A likely TW Hya cluster member, 2 MASS 1207 Ab is an M 8 brown dwarf with a mid to late L type planetary mass companion (Chauvin et al. 2004, Mohanty et al. 2007). Recent observations of spectral variability have uncovered clear signs of disk accretion and outflow, constraining {{the age of the}} system to < 10 Myr. Because of its late spectral type and the clearly youthful nature of the system, 2 MASS 1207 b is definitely a planetary mass object. We have measured the first accurate distance (hence luminosity) for a self-luminous planetary mass object. Our parallax measurements are accurate to < 2 mas (1 σ) for 2 MASS 1207 Ab. With 11 total epochs of data taken in 2006 and 2007, we determine a distance of 63 ± 7. 5 pc (15. 8 + 2. 1 − 1. 6 mas) to 2 MASS 1207 Ab and a luminosity of 8 - 23 × 10 − 6 L ⊙ for 2 MASS 1207 b.

40|$|We present 65 optical {{spectra of}} the Type Ia {{supernova}} SN 2012 fr, of which 33 were obtained before maximum light. At early times SN 2012 fr shows <b>clear</b> evidence of <b>a</b> high-velocity feature (HVF) in the Si II 6355 line {{which can be}} cleanly decoupled from the lower velocity "photospheric" component. This Si II 6355 HVF fades by phase - 5; subsequently, the photospheric component exhibits a very narrow velocity width and remains at a nearly constant velocity of v~ 12, 000 km/s until at least 5 weeks after maximum brightness. The Ca II infrared (IR) triplet exhibits similar evidence for both a photospheric component at v~ 12, 000 km/s with narrow line width and long velocity plateau, {{as well as a}} high-velocity component beginning at v~ 31, 000 km/s two weeks before maximum. SN 2012 fr resides on the border between the "shallow silicon" and "core-normal" subclasses in the Branch et al. (2009) classification scheme, and on the border between normal and "high-velocity" SNe Ia in the Wang et al. (2009 a) system. Though it is <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>member</b> of the "low velocity gradient" (LVG; Benetii et al., 2005) group of SNe Ia and exhibits a very slow light-curve decline, it shows key dissimilarities with the overluminous SN 1991 T or SN 1999 aa subclasses of SNe Ia. SN 2012 fr represents a well-observed SN Ia at the luminous end of the normal SN Ia distribution, and a key transitional event between nominal spectroscopic subclasses of SNe Ia.

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>member</b> of a Central Counterparty (CCP) {{is exposed}} to losses on their default fund and initial margin contributions. Such losses can be {{incurred}} whenever the CCP has insufficient funds to unwind the portfolio of a defaulting clearing member. This does not necessarily require the default of the CCP itself. In this note we aim to quantify the risk a financial institution has when facing a CCP. We show that a clearing member’s CCP risk is given by a sum of exposures {{to each of the}} other clearing members. This arises because of the implicit default insurance that each member has provided in the form of mutualised, loss sharing collateral. We calculate the exposures by explicitly modeling the capital structure of a CCP as well as the loss distributions of the individual member portfolios. An important consideration in designing the model is the limited transparency with respect to the portfolio composition and collateral levels of individual clearing members. To overcome this we leverage the fact that, for a typical CCP, margin levels are risk-based. In particular, we parameterise the portfolio loss tail as a Pareto distribution and we calibrate this to the CCP defined probability of losses exceeding the posted initial margin levels. A key aspect of the model is that we explicitly take into account wrong-way risk, i. e. the fact that member defaults are more likely to occur in stressed market conditions, as well as potential contagion between a member’s default and the losses on his portfolio. Opinions expressed in this paper are those of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the view of JP Morgan. We would like to thank Andrew Abrahams for originating the project on CCP risk and for shaping many of the key ideas. We also thank Regis Guichard, Joe Holderness, Mitchell Smith, Marnie Rosenberg and Rajalakshmi Ramanath for valuable discussions. a...|$|E

The rules initialy exempt firms with less than $ 8 billion in swap activity after a 12 -month period. These rules bring commodity options under the same regulations that apply to swaps. The customer clearing documentation portion of the rule prohibits customer agreements that: disclose {{the identity of the}} customer’s counterparty, limit the number of counterparties with whom a customer may enter into a trade, restrict the size of a customer’s position with any individual counterparty, impair the customer’s access to the best available execution terms, or prevent compliance with clearing time frames. The timing rules require a clearing FCM, or a DCO acting on its behalf, to accept or reject a trade submitted for clearing as quickly as would be technologically practicable if fully automated systems were used. The clearing member risk management rule imposes risk management obligations for each FCM, SD, and MSP that is <b>a</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>member</b> of a DCO. The rules include requirements to record all forms of communication related to swaps trading, measures to prevent conflicts of interest between swap dealers and affiliated FCMs, requirements for designated chief compliance officers and the duties of swap dealers and major swap participants. The CFTC estimates 125 firms will be captured by the swap deal definition. The final rules include an interim final rule exempting trade options from certain swaps regulations.

40|$|Clearing {{is keeping}} track of {{transactions}} until they are settled. Standardized derivatives such as options and futures can be cleared through a clearinghouse if you are <b>a</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>member.</b> The clearinghouse step in as an intermediary between trades and manages all occurring counterparty risk. To {{be able to keep}} track of all transactions and also monitor members risk exposure a clearinghouse use advanced clearing software. Counterparty risk is mainly handled by collecting collateral from each clearing member, the initial collateral that a clearinghouse require from a member trading with derivatives, is called initial margin. Initial margin is calculated by a risk algorithm incorporated in the clearing software. Cinnober Financial Technology delivers clearing solutions to clearinghouses world wide, software providers to the _nancial industry have high demands on software quality. Ensuring high software quality can be done by performing various types of software testing. The goal of this thesis is to implement an extendable random testing framework that can test risk algorithm implementations that are part of a clearing system under development by Cinnober. By using the implemented framework, we aim to verify if the risk algorithm SPAN calculates fair initial margin amount. We also intend to increase the quality assurance of the risk domain that is responsible for all risk calculations. In this thesis we implement a random testing framework suitable for testing risk algorithms. Furthermore, we implement a framework extension for SPAN that is used to test the SPAN algorithm's initial margin calculations. The implementation consist of two main parts, the _rst being a random generation entity that feeds the clearing system with randomized input data. The second part is a veri_cation entity called test oracle, it is responsible for verifying the SPAN algorithm's calculation results. The random testing framework for risk algorithms was successfully implemented. By running the SPAN extension of the framework, we managed to _nd four issues related to the accuracy of the SPAN algorithm. This discovery led {{to the conclusion that the}} current SPAN algorithm implementation does not calculate fair initial margin. It also led to an immediate increase of quality assurance because the issues will be corrected. As a result of the frameworks extensible characteristics, long term quality also increases...|$|E

This paper examines this question for computer-mediated idea generation. In two separate studies, intact groups generated more ideas (with higher quality) than those working as individuals or in several smaller sub-groups.

40|$|AbstractThe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has {{a policy}} {{framework}} for how <b>clearing</b> <b>member</b> banks should treat their exposures to central counterparties (CCPs). Default funds {{play a crucial}} role as a risk mitigant in this framework. Furthermore, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (together abbreviated as CPSS-IOSCO) produced a set of 26 principles for financial market infrastructures. For a CCP to be deemed a qualified CCP, it has to abide by these principles. <b>Clearing</b> <b>member</b> banks with trade exposures to a qualified CCP will get preferential capital treatment under the BCBS framework. None of the principles or the policy framework requires, or forces a CCP to have a default fund. However, regulators prefer CCPs to have default funds in place to enhance their credit risk management practices, as required by principles 4 and 6 of the CPSS-IOSCO, before they will be qualified. We consider the merits of the BCBS's requirements for <b>a</b> <b>clearing</b> house, in <b>a</b> developing country such as South Africa, to become <b>a</b> qualified <b>clearing</b> house and conclude that a CCP with prudent risk management processes and controls, should not be disqualified if a default fund is not established...|$|R

Consequently, the urban environment is becoming an increasingly important refuge for bumblebee species.
