2500|$|On 19 February 2015, it was {{revealed}} West had already filmed his final scenes and left the show. Former Fawlty Towers star, Andrew Sachs, was announced to be joining the show on 10 March 2015 as Cyril Bishop, roommate of Stan when he is admitted to hospital. Sachs' first scenes were announced to air on 18 March 2015. Cyril died in the following episode, saddening Stan. Bradshaw-White teased Stan's exit week {{in an interview with}} Inside Soap, saying that Tina would take over Stan's care when Mick and Shirley become too embroiled in arguing to notice the pain he is going through. Discussing Stan's death, Bradshaw-White said, [...] "Stan has another one of his episodes and Tina just falls apart. So {{the rest of the family}} end up sending her home - they think she's not going to be able to cope with him dying. Tina goes back to The Vic thinking that she'll come in and see her dad again in the morning, but then he tragically dies that night." [...] Stan's final scenes aired on 10 April 2015 when after an emotional heart-to-heart with Shirley, he peacefully died in a hospice. Rather than the regular [...] "Doof Doofs" [...] that feature at the end of each episode, Fly Me to the Moon, as sung by Tony Bennett, was played over the credits in tribute to Stan. Following his on-screen exit, West spoke out in support of Prostate Cancer UK and signed up for the Men United campaign, [...] "Stan was probably the archetypal bad patient. He was very slow in thinking about his condition and recognising what it might be. He was slow to seek diagnosis, slow to act on the diagnosis and reluctant to see doctors. He was terrible really, something we should <b>all</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> and not do the same. What Men United seeks to do, and it's terribly important, is to hold out a hand to people to say, 'Come on, you will see people here with whom you can swap experiences, swap ideas, swap thoughts, swap feelings'. You don't have to stand there and wait for people to come, because they won't. You just need a little push and you will like it when you get there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Back at Mr. Gold's shop he swaps Hook's {{hand for}} the actual hook, but says that their deal is not done. Hook {{says that it is}} done because he saw Mr. Gold use the real dagger to open the box, which means he is still lying to Belle. Mr. Gold {{produces}} a video tape with a recording from the house they just left, threatening to reveal it to Emma. Hook states he only did it to rid himself of the cursed hand to be a better man, and that Emma will understand that. Mr. Gold then reveals that the hand is not cursed, but it allowed Hook to be [...] "the man he really is." [...] Mr. Gold states the hand allows him to be his true pirate self and embrace his darkness. Hook threatens that he'll have no problem [...] "crushing Belle's heart" [...] with the truth of Gold's deception and Mr. Gold states if that happens, he will [...] "lose" [...] Emma. For his threats, Gold states that Hook now serves him {{for as long as he}} lives, anticipating the [...] "fun" [...] they will have together. Emma visits the jail to talk to Will Scarlet and shows him the book he was found next to. He tries to say it has no meaning to him. Emma looks at his eye and asks what happened. Will sees Hook arrive and claims that he does not remember what happened to his eye. When Emma asks him about his hook being back, Hook states that Mr. Gold's magic wasn't what he had hoped it would be. David, going through documents with Elsa, tells Emma that the Snow Queen's alias, Sarah Fisher, is nowhere in any Storybrooke records stating that she did not arrive at the town via the curse. Hook, Emma, David and Elsa <b>all</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> each other wondering how the Snow Queen arrived at Storybrooke and Emma asks what she wants with her. Henry tells Regina that they need to talk to his other grandpa, Mr. Gold, about finding out who wrote the book to find the author. Regina says that Mr. Gold will not want to help her, so he goes to the shop and tells Mr. Gold that he wants to work at the shop. Henry states that because his father is dead Mr. Gold is the closest link to him, [...] Mr. Gold agrees to let Henry be his apprentice, but tells him not to touch anything. Then, Mr. Gold hands him the broom he and Hook used to find the Apprentice. After Mr. Gold leaves, Henry begins to sweep the floor.|$|E
60|$|<b>All</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him in wonder, save Nibs, who {{fortunately}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Wendy.|$|R
60|$|They <b>all</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Geoffrey. He {{shrugged his}} broad shoulders.|$|R
60|$|<b>All</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> James. He {{was leaning}} forward {{with his hand}} behind his ear.|$|R
60|$|They <b>all</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{one another}} {{as if there were}} some {{sinister}} significance in what she has said.|$|E
6000|$|He {{looks at}} FAITH. They <b>all</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> FAITH. But {{her face is}} so [...] strange, so tremulous, that they all turn their eyes away.|$|E
6000|$|MRS. DEARTH (the {{only one}} who is undaunted). A second chance! (She is looking at her husband. They <b>all</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{him as if he}} had been a leader once.) ...|$|E
60|$|They <b>all</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her. It {{had always}} been known that Winifred had pluck.|$|R
60|$|They <b>all</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> one another. Dan ran out {{and brought}} in his roses.|$|R
60|$|They <b>all</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> one another. Their relief {{had grown}} too poignant for words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because you <b>all</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me like that," [...] {{cried the}} young man, angrily. [...] "Do you think I don't know you're {{always talking about}} my damned debts and expectations?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Quite softly CLARE {{begins to}} laugh. <b>All</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her first with [...] surprise, then with offence, then almost with horror. GEORGE is [...] {{about to go}} up to her, but HUNTINGDON heads him off.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know," [...] she cried. [...] "I am afraid. I {{dare not}} stay there. They <b>all</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{one another and}} leave off talking when I {{come into the room}} unexpectedly. They all seem as though some trouble were hanging over them. I am afraid to be there, Mr. Andrew." ...|$|E
60|$|They <b>all</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Whamond, and he dug {{his teeth}} into his lips in shame.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} they <b>all</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{one another in}} silence. Then Haddo turned to his servants.|$|R
60|$|It was unanswerable, inexplicable. They <b>all</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{one another}} almost helplessly. Pamela {{held out her}} hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not {{say that}} at <b>all.</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> the {{men who have been}} leading statesmen since our present mode of {{government}} was formed,--from the days in which it was forming itself, say from Walpole down, and you will find that all who have been of real use had early training as public servants." ...|$|E
6000|$|FERRAND. [Rising.] Ah! Ma'moiselle! Luck! There is {{the little}} God who dominates us <b>all.</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> this old! [He points to TIMSON.] He is finished. In his day that old would be doing good business. He could afford himself--[He maker a sign of drinking.]--Then come the motor cars. All goes--he has nothing left, only 'is 'abits of a 'cocher'! Luck! ...|$|E
6000|$|My cousin meditated, {{no doubt}} {{with his hands}} deep in his trousers' pockets. [...] "It is illusion," [...] he said. [...] "It {{is a sort of}} glamour. After <b>all,</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it squarely. What is she? What can she give you? She {{promises}} you vague somethings.... She is a snare, she is deception. She is the beautiful mask of death." ...|$|E
60|$|We <b>all</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> each other, {{trying to}} glean {{something}} each from the other. We {{were afraid to}} think.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the ladies}} <b>all</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him, and {{thought they had}} never seen {{anything}} so terrible as that squint.|$|R
60|$|There was a silence, <b>all</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{the lord}} deputy, whose eyes were {{kindling}} {{in a very}} ugly way.|$|R
6000|$|... "A certain axe!" [...] I cried. [...] "Aye, {{a certain}} axe! Well, {{look at that}} which is held by the Black One, the captain who is named Slaughterer, the ancient axe whose title is Chieftainess, because if so she wills, she takes the lives of <b>all.</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> it well, Rezu, Giant and Wizard, and say whether {{it is not that}} which your forefather lost, that which is destined to bring you to your doom?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After <b>all,</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me! I was {{out there}} a year, and here I am with only half a game leg; times were a lot worse, then, too. I often wish I were back there. Anything's better than London and the War Office." [...] But just {{then he saw the}} padre coming, and took her hand. [...] "Good night, Miss Pierson. Don't worry. That does no good, and there isn't half the risk you think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I've exercised," [...] {{came the}} quick reply. [...] "There wasn't {{any need for}} any of them to get it if they'd only got out and done something. What did they do? Growled and kicked and grouched at the cold, the long nights, the hardships, the aches and pains and {{everything}} else. They loafed in their beds until they swelled up and couldn't leave them, that's <b>all.</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> me. I've worked. Come into my cabin." ...|$|E
60|$|Why are you <b>all</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> me like that? You {{look as if}} {{you were}} going to try me for something.|$|R
60|$|<b>At</b> this {{announcement}} <b>all</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{each other with}} added alarm showing in their faces. A pest ship! The idea filled them with horror.|$|R
60|$|They <b>all</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> one another. The Inspector was {{the only}} one who {{preserved}} an air of cheerfulness, and he was glancing towards Laura.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] he {{continued}} amiably, [...] "there {{is no need}} for us to quarrel, I hope. We <b>all</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> things differently in this world, and, fortunately, the matter which I want to discuss with you lies right outside the operations of the B. & I. When {{can you give me a}} few moments of your time, Mr. Wingate? Will you call around at our offices, Number 13 Throgmorton Street, next Tuesday morning at, say? eleven-thirty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... (The {{conversation}} drops. Gloria and Dolly {{look at one}} another; then at Valentine and Philip. Valentine and Philip, unequal to the occasion, {{look away}} from them at one another, and are instantly so disconcerted by catching one another's eye, that they look back again and catch the eyes of Gloria and Dolly. Thus, catching one another all round, they <b>all</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> nothing and are quite at a loss. Crampton looks about him, {{waiting for them to}} begin. The silence becomes unbearable.) ...|$|E
60|$|You {{might think}} that these qualities would displease the reviewer's editor. Not at <b>all,</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> any column of short notices, and you will {{occasionally}} find that the critic has anticipated my advice. There is no topic in which the men who write about it are so little interested as contemporary literature. Perhaps this is no matter to marvel at. By the way, a capital plan is not to write your review till the book has been out for two years. This is the favourite dodge of the ---, that distinguished journal.|$|E
60|$|The {{lights were}} brought in as she {{finished}} her little speech, and they <b>all</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> one another. Lady Thurwell broke into a little laugh.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{knock at}} the door. We <b>all</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> one another. A {{magnificent}} person with powdered hair, breeches and silk stockings presented himself.|$|R
60|$|They <b>all</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{him as he}} uttered {{this piece}} of impudence. He seemed to be sunning himself in the {{presence}} of so many damsels.|$|R
