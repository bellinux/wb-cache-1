Influenced by his father at a young age, Chan developed a love for table tennis and joined the Hong Kong Table Tennis team after receiving rigorous training at the Jubilee Sports Academy when he was thirteen. He was the youngest player to represent Hong Kong in overseas competitions at the time. After five years of committing to the sport, Chan left the team upon finishing his high school education exams. After graduation, Chan was accepted into a technical institution and, attracted by the 3,000 HKD monthly income, also joined TVB's Artiste Training Class. Being only seventeen at the time, Chan was required to have his parents' <b>signed</b> <b>approval</b> before <b>signing</b> a management contract with TVB.

50|$|Like all Interstate {{highways}} in Indiana, the I-465 beltway {{was constructed}} in segments which when all were complete, made up the route we know today (with {{the exception of the}} 4.72 mi renamed as I-865 in 2002). There were 16 segments along the original semi-circumferential selected alignment between I-65 in Boone County at exit 129 and that same highway six miles to the south at exit 123 in Marion County. Indiana highway officials recognized the value of having the route be a full circumferential, so using non-Interstate federal funding and employing a temporary designation of SR 100 they planned a separate 17th segment northward between I-65 at its exit 123 and the north leg of I-465 in Boone County. By the time that added section was completed in 1970, Indiana had obtained federal <b>approval</b> to <b>sign</b> it as I-465 as well, resulting {{in the creation of the}} dogleg part of I-465 outside of the loop (now I-865 as noted above).|$|R
