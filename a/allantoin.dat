500|$|Uric acid {{is by far}} {{the highest}} {{concentration}} antioxidant in human blood. [...] Uric acid (UA) is an antioxidant oxypurine produced from xanthine by the enzyme xanthine oxidase, and is an intermediate product of purine metabolism. In almost all land animals, urate oxidase further catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to <b>allantoin,</b> but in humans and most higher primates, the urate oxidase gene is nonfunctional, so that UA is not further broken down. The evolutionary reasons for this loss of urate conversion to <b>allantoin</b> remain the topic of active speculation. The antioxidant effects of uric acid have led researchers to suggest this mutation was beneficial to early primates and humans. Studies of high altitude acclimatization support the hypothesis that urate acts as an antioxidant by mitigating the oxidative stress caused by high-altitude hypoxia.|$|E
2500|$|Philosopher Gary Steiner {{argues that}} it is not {{possible}} to be entirely vegan, because animal use and products are [...] "deeply and imperceptibly woven into the fabric of human society". Animal products in common use include albumen, <b>allantoin,</b> beeswax, blood, bone char, bone china, carmine, casein, castoreum, cochineal, elastin, emu oil, gelatin, honey, isinglass, keratin, lactic acid, lanolin, lard, rennet, retinol, shellac, squalene, tallow/sodium tallowate, whey and yellow grease. Some of these are chemical compounds that can be derived from animal products, plants, or petrochemicals. <b>Allantoin,</b> lactic acid, retinol and squalene, for example, can be vegan.

2500|$|The term [...] "urea" [...] is {{also used}} for a class of {{chemical}} compounds that share the same functional group, a carbonyl group attached to two organic amine residues: RR'N—CO—NRR'. Examples include carbamide peroxide, <b>allantoin,</b> and hydantoin. Ureas {{are closely related to}} biurets and related in structure to amides, carbamates, carbodiimides, and thiocarbamides.|$|E
2500|$|Urate (C5H4N4O3) stones, usually {{ammonium}} urate (NH4·C5H4N4O3) or sodium urate monohydrate (Na·C5H4N4O3×H2O), form in an acidic to neutral urine. [...] They {{are usually}} small, yellow-brown, smooth stones. [...] Urate stones form {{due to an}} increased excretion of uric acid in the urine. [...] Dalmatians (especially males) {{and to a lesser}} extent Bulldogs are genetically predisposed to the formation of urate stones because of an altered metabolism of purines. [...] Dalmatians have a decreased rate of urate hepatic transport, leading to only about 30 to 40 percent conversion of urate to <b>allantoin,</b> compared with greater than 90 percent conversion in other breeds. [...] Dogs with portosystemic shunts or endstage liver disease also have increased uric acid excretion in the urine due to reduced conversion of uric acid to <b>allantoin</b> and ammonia to urea. [...] Urate stones make up about six percent of all stones in the cat.|$|E
2500|$|The {{compound}} {{was discovered}} by Justus von Liebig and Friedrich Wöhler. It {{is one of the}} oldest named organic compounds. [...] It was originally prepared in 1818 by Brugnatelli (1761-1818) and was named in 1838 by Wöhler and Liebig. [...] The name [...] "Alloxan" [...] emerged from an amalgamation of the words [...] "allantoin" [...] and [...] "Oxalsäure" [...] (oxalic acid). The alloxan model of diabetes was first described in rabbits by Dunn, Sheehan and McLetchie in 1943. [...] The name is derived from <b>allantoin,</b> a product of uric acid excreted by the fetus into the allantois, and oxaluric acid derived from oxalic acid and urea, found in urine.|$|E

50|$|Pegloticase is a {{recombinant}} porcine-like uricase. Similarly to rasburicase, it metabolises {{uric acid}} to <b>allantoin.</b> This {{reduces the risk}} of precipitates, since <b>allantoin</b> is five to ten times more soluble than uric acid.|$|E
50|$|The Dalmatian dog has {{a genetic}} defect in uric acid uptake by {{the liver and}} kidneys, {{resulting}} in decreased conversion to <b>allantoin,</b> so this breed excretes uric acid, and not <b>allantoin,</b> in the urine.|$|E
50|$|In Streptomyces coelicolor, allantoinase (EC 3.5.2.5) and allantoicase (EC 3.5.3.4) are {{essential}} for <b>allantoin</b> metabolism.

50|$|In bacteria, purines {{and their}} {{derivatives}} (such as <b>allantoin)</b> {{are used as}} secondary sources of nitrogen under nutrient-limiting conditions.

50|$|<b>Allantoin</b> is a {{chemical}} compound with formula C4H6N4O3. It is also called 5-ureidohydantoin or glyoxyldiureide.

50|$|Bacillus fastidious has {{the ability}} to use uricase to degrade uric acid to <b>allantoin,</b> and then use allantoinase to degrade <b>allantoin</b> to allantoate. It also {{has the ability}} to further break down allantoate to ammonia and ureidoglycolate via the enzyme allantoate amidohydrolase. The liberation of ammonia causes its local {{environment}} to rise to a pH between 8 and 9. However, attempts to grow Bacillus fastidious at those higher pH's without urea present were unsuccessful. It is able to metabolize ureidoglycolate further into urea and glyoxylate using the enzyme ureidoglycolase. Bacillus fastidious is also able to use urease to degrade urea.|$|E

50|$|Named {{after the}} allantois (an amniote {{embryonic}} excretory organ {{in which it}} concentrates during development in most mammals except humans and other higher apes), it {{is a product of}} oxidation of uric acid by purine catabolism. After birth, it is the predominant means by which nitrogenous waste is excreted in the urine of these animals. In humans and other higher apes, the metabolic pathway for conversion of uric acid to <b>allantoin</b> is not present, so the former is excreted. Recombinant rasburicase is sometimes used as a drug to catalyze this metabolic conversion in patients. In fish, <b>allantoin</b> is broken down further (into ammonia) before excretion.|$|E
