2500|$|Hart, from Colorado, was a {{more serious}} threat to Mondale, and after winning several early {{primaries}} it looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> take the nomination away from Mondale. Hart finished a surprising second in the Iowa caucuses, with 16.5% of the vote. This established him as the main rival to Mondale, effectively eliminating John Glenn, Ernest Hollings and Alan Cranston as alternatives. Hart criticized Mondale as an [...] "old-fashioned" [...] New Deal Democrat who symbolized [...] "failed policies" [...] of the past. [...] Hart positioned himself (just as Bill Clinton would eight years later) as a younger, fresher, and more moderate Democrat who could appeal to younger voters. [...] He emerged as a formidable candidate, winning the key New Hampshire, Ohio, and California primaries {{as well as several}} others, especially in the West. [...] However, Hart could not overcome Mondale's financial and organizational advantages, especially among labor union leaders in the Midwest and industrial Northeast.|$|E
6000|$|Again no one felt {{called upon}} to answer, and Almira glanced archly at the young editor <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have added: [...] "and improved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He doesn't {{look as if}} {{he belonged}} to this crowd," [...] was Dick's comment. [...] "He looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be a {{thorough}} gentleman." ...|$|E
60|$|The mariner of the {{brigantine}} {{drew back}} with dignity; and then, instantly recovering his ease, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> fearful <b>he</b> <b>might</b> forget himself, <b>he</b> said with warmth.|$|R
6000|$|He lighted another match, hurriedly this time, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> fearing <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{not have}} the courage to apply it, and when it was fully on fire muttered to himself: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} certain he said so, though I don't {{know whether the}} promise meant much. But <b>he</b> {{certainly}} spoke <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{be able to help}} me, and, though it did not seem likely that I could have such bad luck twice, I think he meant at the time what he said, and I should think he was the sort of man who would keep his word." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{probably}} thought this a neat, off-hand {{way of making}} the invitation, for {{he looked at his}} woman-kind <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> expect their admiration.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder who}} the old gentleman can be? He looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have money. That diamond ring he wears must be worth several hundred dollars." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her; first {{as if he}} were trying to remember, then <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have been trying to forget. [...] "Nothing, I think--at that place." ...|$|E
60|$|She spoke, he said, almost reproachfully, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{she thought}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> go away on his wings, after all.|$|R
60|$|Stillwell {{paused in}} the rapid {{delivery}} of his narrative; he still retained Madeline's hand, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> by that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> comfort her.|$|R
60|$|Ella, {{after making}} Toby promise {{that he would}} see her again that night, went with Mr. and Mrs. Treat, while old Ben, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> afraid <b>he</b> <b>might</b> receive more thanks, walked quickly away towards the dressing-rooms, {{and there was nothing}} else for Toby and Abner to do but go home.|$|R
60|$|The boys {{watched the}} fish and seals taken ashore, and then caught sight {{of a man in}} the crowd who looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be American or English.|$|E
60|$|She {{lifted her}} face to him, all shining and open. It was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> enter {{straight}} into the source of her radiance. His face became a little distracted.|$|E
60|$|Barker {{was still}} standing, {{and on the}} fret, but after a moment's hesitation, he sat down <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> spring up again the next minute. They ordered drinks in silence.|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} Clementina <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> thought she <b>might</b> dispute this, but she consented at her sweetest, [...] "Oh, yes, indeed," [...] {{and he went}} on: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, thank you! Aren't {{they just}} elegant? I never see such beauties," [...] stammered the poor boy, {{grasping}} his treasures <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> feared they <b>might</b> vanish away.|$|R
60|$|When he {{went forward}} the {{men did not}} pay the {{slightest}} attention to his movements, but continued their conversation <b>as</b> <b>if</b> whatever <b>he</b> <b>might</b> do was no concern of theirs. It was not until he halted {{directly in front of}} the party that the red-nosed man so much as raised his eyes.|$|R
60|$|One {{of these}} searchers for useless {{treasure}} straightened {{up as we}} approached, and I {{saw that he was}} an old man, who looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have been a gentleman's servant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, well! This beats {{anything}} I {{ever saw}} or heard of!" [...] exclaimed Aunt Em, and {{she glanced at}} the Wizard almost fearfully, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be dangerous because of his great powers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Trova?" [...] said Ciccio, with a curl of the lip. He looked, as {{he dropped}} his long, {{beautiful}} lashes, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> weep for all that, if he were not bound to be misbehaving just now.|$|E
60|$|We found Corky {{near the}} door, {{looking at the}} picture, with one hand up in a {{defensive}} sort of way, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> thought it <b>might</b> swing on him.|$|R
60|$|The {{prisoner}} {{was being}} led in by a burly policeman, who kept a firm {{hold on the}} boy's collar <b>as</b> <b>if</b> fearful <b>he</b> <b>might</b> make some desperate attempt at escape, {{and there was not}} a person in the court-room, with the probable exception of Sam Barney, who failed to feel a certain sympathy for the frightened lad.|$|R
60|$|He {{gave her}} the paper, which he had kept behind him, {{clutched}} fast in his hand <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> feared it <b>might</b> somehow escape him at last, and staggered away to a chair.|$|R
60|$|He {{returned}} from that auction {{with a new}} set of feelings in play. He had certainly made a surprising mistake in thinking Johns his successful rival. It really seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> hope for Sally after all.|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't," [...] Nasmyth owned. [...] "Still, {{though the}} man has made one very bad break, I hardly {{expected}} him to exceed every limit. At present it looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> do so; he'll probably be forced to." ...|$|E
60|$|Lander now {{leaned back}} and looked over his {{shoulder}} at his wife <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> hopefully suppose she had {{come to the end of}} her questions, but she gave no sign of encouraging him to start on their way again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldn't whip him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{never did}} anything," [...] said Toby, as he hugged his pet tightly, almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> feared Joe <b>might</b> attempt, {{as one of}} the {{partners}} in the enterprise, to whip the unwilling performer.|$|R
60|$|He gave Mr Dombey his hand, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{feared it}} <b>might</b> {{electrify}} him. Mr Dombey tool: it <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{it were a}} fish, or seaweed, or some such clammy substance, and immediately returned it to him with exalted politeness.|$|R
60|$|Toto did {{not like}} this {{addition}} to the party at first. He smelled around the stuffed man <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> suspected there <b>might</b> be a nest of rats in the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the Scarecrow.|$|R
60|$|I {{began to}} understand. As I say, Uncle Willoughby had been {{somewhat}} on the tabasco side {{as a young}} man, and it began to look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have turned out something pretty fruity if he had started recollecting his long life.|$|E
6000|$|... "I sized him up as {{not being}} able to endure a long trip after a buffalo," [...] said the guide, in {{speaking}} afterward of the meeting. [...] "He was well mounted, but he looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> play out before the sun went down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{wanted to}} finish this thing right here," [...] she said impatiently. She {{was silent for a}} moment, with her arched black brows knitted. Then she said abruptly, [...] "Who's that smart little chap that let me in? He looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be trusted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Toby, slowly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> feared <b>he</b> <b>might</b> provoke one {{of those}} terrible {{laughing}} spells again, [...] "I saw him tonight, an' <b>he</b> looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew what I was doin'; so I up an' told him, an' I didn't know but he'd told you, though he didn't look {{to me like a}} feller that would be mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked in}} vague pain all round {{the top of}} the room and drew his breath, two or three times over, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> with difficulty. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> have been {{standing}} {{at the bottom of the}} sea and raising his eyes to some faint green twilight. [...] "Well--I said things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly," [...] {{replied the}} {{disguised}} Monarch, [...] "the sovereign and the palace are not ill matched;--these tattered hangings and my ragged jerkin suit each other admirably.--This Woodstock!--this the bower where the royal Norman revelled with the fair Rosamond Clifford!--Why, it {{is a place}} of assignation for owls." [...] Then, suddenly recollecting himself, with his natural courtesy, <b>he</b> added, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> fearing <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have hurt Albert's feelings--"But the more obscure and retired, it is the fitter for our purpose, Lee; and if it does seem to be a roost for owls, as there is no denying, why we know it has nevertheless brought up eagles." ...|$|R
