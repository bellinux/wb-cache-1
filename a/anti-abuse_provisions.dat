40|$|Although it {{exhibits}} {{a series of}} interesting properties including {{putting an end to}} transfer pricing and other losses and profit distribution strategies, the allocation of cross border profits in line with international consolidation and apportionment raises some issues. One of them is the temptation for companies to locate their taxable profits outside the consolidating area, a behavior likely to ruin all the best of the system. Therefore consolidation and apportionment should be supplemented with a serious series of <b>anti-abuse</b> measures, especially <b>provisions</b> against controlled foreign companies. Those imply a revision of the taxation of foreign companies, actually a move from exemption to crediting for participating countries, and a revision of tax treaties accordingly. However, such a change, despite its economic justification, would raise several legal issues, such as its compatibility with the OECD Model and with EC Law (in the European context). The possibility of restricting this change to the sole abusive situations should be examined. Keywords: European Union, Multinational Firms, Taxation JEL: F 23, H 25, K 3...|$|R
40|$|In 1992, Chairman Rostenkowski {{introduced}} legislation that imposed US {{capital gains tax}} on foreign sellers of large blocks of shares (10 percent or more) in US corporations.

40|$|In recent years, the {{challenge}} posed by tax fraud and tax evasion has increased considerably {{and has become}} a major concern within the European Union. As a consequence, in the European initiatives a special emphasis has been laid on the actions aimed at reinforcing the <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>provisions</b> in bilateral tax treaties, national legislation and EU corporate legislation. Any artificial arrangement carried out for tax avoidance purposes would be ignored and companies would be taxed instead on the basis of actual economic substance. The aim of the article is presenting the European initiative aimed at implementing the automatic mode of the exchange of information on cross-border tax rulings and advance pricing arrangements. The paper investigates if the implemented measure can help Member States to detect certain abusive tax practices taken by companies, and to take the effective actions in response. It also tries to answer the question whether the initiative can result in more transparency and – as a consequence – in much better governance, both at the states’ and the corporations’ level...|$|E
40|$|In the {{proposal}} for a Council Directive on a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) there have been introduced a specific <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>provisions,</b> CFC rules. These rules are aimed at tax evasions and tax avoidance. The basic principle is {{the protection of the}} tax base against erosion through practices of artificial income shifting. Generally, CFC rules prevent tax avoidance in a state of a shareholder by denying the deferred taxation of profits generated by its controlled company, which is a resident in a tax preference jurisdiction. Even thought the CCCTB directive would be aided easier and low-costs cross-border business as well as it would be restricted the harmful tax competition there are questions whether it is advisable to introduce these rules into such system of the CCCTB, whether these rules are compatible with the CCCTB and whether it is regulated properly.

40|$|The {{past few}} years have seen a surge of new {{political}} initiatives {{with the aim of}} combating tax evasion and tax avoidance. As a part of these initiatives on the level of the European Union, the Council enacted in January 2015 a new general anti-abuse provision to the Parent-Subsidiary Directive. The Parent-Subsidiary Directive regulates tax benefits to cross-border distributions in the EU with the purpose of eliminating obstacles to formation of corporate groups across the Member State borders. The Directive contained previously a provision that authorized the Member States to apply their national <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>provisions</b> within the scope of the Directive although the application of these provisions was voluntary, and the content and scope of the national provisions was not regulated by the Directive. In the words of the Commission, the purpose of the change was to prevent misuse of the Directive and to create consistency, and these aims were to be achieved by introduction of a common anti-abuse rule in all the Member States. The new general anti-abuse rule in the Parent-Subsidiary Directive represents an approach without precedents in the field of European direct tax law since it creates a detailed anti-abuse provision with the objective of harmonizing the national anti-abuse rules applicable to the benefits of the Directive. Most of all, the Member States are, from now on, obliged to combat abuse within the scope of the Directive since the new provision has to be implemented and applied nationally. The provision raises, however, several questions regarding its application and its effects as a part of European tax legislation. The wording of the provision, which contains several conditions with the aim of defining abuse {{in the context of the}} Directive, reflects the varying formulations the ECJ has used in its case law on anti-abuse measures. It may appear prima facie that the provision marks a departure from the consistent case law and creates a new concept of abuse in the field of European tax law. The purpose of the research is to discuss the possible interpretations and the impact of the new provision. The different conditions of the provision are evaluated in the light of the ECJ case law in order to clarify their scope and meaning. The effects of the provision are discussed with respect to the immediate effects of its application, the effects on the Member States and their national anti-abuse rules, and the possible conflicts with the primary law of the EU. The ECJ direct tax case law contains a line of case law where the Court has examined abuse of tax law and the possibility to enact measures in order to combat abusive transactions. The concept of abuse within the field of European direct tax law has been developed especially in relation to such Member State anti-abuse measures which have had restrictive effects on the fundamental freedoms. In this case law, the ECJ has required that these <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>provisions</b> must combat only "wholly artificial arrangements", and the Court has developed specific tests which the national rules must respect when establishing the abusive nature of a transaction. This case law is discussed extensively in order to establish the possible interpretations for the new provision. Regarding the interpretation of the new anti-abuse provision, most questions arise in relation to the relevance of tax purposes and the genuine-nature of the arrangement. Given the variance in the ECJ case law, several ways to interpret the provision are compared in order to establish the most reasonable interpretation. In addition, the discussion reveals different points of uncertainty with regard to the way how the benefits of the Directive are meant to be denied and how the implementation of the provision affects national anti-abuse clauses and the freedom of movement. The research establishes that the new anti-abuse provision can be interpreted in accordance with the established ECJ case law although the wide latitudes of the provision mean that it can be subjected to various interpretations. The most important effects of the provision reside in its compulsory application and the impact on national legislation. The provision can, effectively, prevent the national legislators from adopting different solutions in its scope of application. The actual consequences for the companies that fall within the ambit of the provision contain several questions that cannot be given an unequivocal answer based on the wording of the provision alone. Most of all, the provision is set to cause uncertainty before its scope has been definitely scrutinized by the ECJ...|$|E
40|$|This paper takes a {{new look}} at the {{cross-border}} dividend-stripping transactions that gave rise to the Fifth Circuit’s opinion in Compaq v. Commissioner and the Eighth Circuit’s opinion in IES Industries v. Commissioner. In both cases, the circuit courts held for the taxpayers and rejected the Commissioner’s claim that the transactions lacked economic substance because the taxpayers were sure to lose money on the transactions before taxes. These cases generated extensive commentary that was split into two diametrically opposed camps. One group argued that the decisions were correct because the transactions were economically profitable business transactions. The other group argued that the transactions were blatant, abusive tax shelters; and that the courts should have struck them down. Because the commentators in the second group conceded that the transactions generated a pre-tax profit, these commentators also offered a range of proposals to modify or replace the pre-tax profit test. Although the tax benefit of crossborder dividend-stripping was sharply reduced by subsequent Congressional enactments, that action hid rather than resolved the issue whether the tax shelter jurisprudence is fundamentally flawed because there is a class of abusive transactions that produce a guaranteed profit before tax, but do not run afoul of the <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>provisions</b> in the tax law. This paper argues that the Compaq and IES Industries transactions do not reveal any fundamental failings with either anti-abuse jurisprudence generally or the pre-tax profit test in particular. This paper demonstrates that the circuit courts reached the wrong conclusions in those cases because the parties, the courts, and the commentators all ignored implicit taxes. That is not surprising because the implicit taxes in these cases were difficult to see. These taxes were negative implicit taxes, which drove down the cum dividend price of the stripped stock, and therefore made the transactions appear profitable before taxes. However, once implicit taxes are taken into account, the transactions in those cases are properly understood to be unprofitable before taxes. Finally, nearly ten years ago, Charlotte Crane observed that tax doctrine has all but ignored implicit taxes and she challenged commentators, lawyers and judges to think carefully about how implicit taxes can be incorporated into tax doctrine. My proposal to calculate pre-tax profit for the purpose of anti-abuse jurisprudence before both implicit and explicit taxes is, I believe, the first proposal to explicitly recognize implicit taxes in tax doctrine...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} taxes paid by {{multinational}} enterprises (MNEs) in host and home countries {{continues to make}} headline news. Corporate tax regimes, particularly those in many OECD countries, have never been more complex and the competition {{to attract and retain}} foreign direct investment (FDI) has perhaps never been so great. All of these political, legal, economic and competitive realities face countries {{at a time when they}} need additional budget revenues. At the June 2012 G- 20 Summit in Los Cabos, leaders identified base erosion and profit shifting as key fiscal issue to be addressed. Many are expecting this to translate into a new approach to applying existing international tax standards, an increased pressure to eliminate "corporate tax breaks", enact tougher <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>provisions,</b> and less tolerance of aggressive tax planning. There has been an increased critical focus on transfer pricing, corporate restructuring and double tax treaties. Some have suggested that double tax treaties are eroding the domestic tax bases of developing countries, while others conclude that double tax treaties promote development and FDI and thereby expand the tax base. Dividing up a "revenue pie" has never been easy and the implementation of international tax rules to transparently and predictably allocate revenue to avoid double taxation and double non taxation has never been more adversarial between taxpayers and tax authorities and between tax jurisdictions. It was for these reasons that the Global Tax Policy Center of the Institute for Austrian and International Tax Law (Vienna University of Economics and Business) and the International Tax and Investment Center (ITIC) decided to undertake this study. The objective of our study was to look at the development impact of double taxation treaties and, more broadly, how tax policy can help generate economic growth and prosperity. Legally domestic tax laws are normally subordinate to international double taxation treaties, but in reality a double tax treaty only serves a country as well as its domestic tax regime. We've concluded that the problems affecting developing countries lie not with double tax treaties but rather in weak domestic tax legislation. Our study reviews empirical data from 20 developing countries, including LDCs, middle-to-high income developing countries, resource-rich countries, and BRIICS[1] countries. We hope that the empirical analysis and the conclusions that can be drawn from it can help guide policymakers to refocus their policy objectives to boost capital formation, expanding exports, and protect their domestic tax bases. We believe that a country with strong domestic tax legislation can advance their pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals by affectively utilizing double tax treaties and the related international tax rules to more transparently share and grow their tax base.

40|$|This report uses {{data on the}} {{operations}} of U. S. multinational companies (MNCs) to examine the extent to which, if any, MNCs are moving profits out of high-tax countries (or out of the U. S.) and into low-tax countries with little corresponding change in business operations, a practice known as “profit shifting. ” To do this, the profits reported by American firms in two groups of countries are compared with measures of real economic activity in those locations. The first group consists of the five countries commonly identified as being “tax preferred” or “tax haven” countries, and includes Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. The second group, which provides a baseline for comparison, consists of five more traditional economies. This group includes Australia, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. Consistent {{with the findings of}} existing research, the analysis presented here appear to show that significant shares of profits are being reported in tax preferred countries and that these shares are disproportionate to the location of the firm’s business activity as indicated by where they hire workers and make investments. For example, American companies reported earning 43 % of overseas profits in Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Switzerland in 2008, while hiring 4 % of their foreign workforce and making 7 % of their foreign investments in those economies. In comparison, the traditional economies of Australia, Canada, Germany, Mexico and the United Kingdom accounted for 14 % of American MNCs overseas’ profits, but 40 % of foreign hired labor and 34 % of foreign investment. This report also shows that the discrepancy between where profits are reported and where hiring and investment occurs, as examples of business activity, has increased over time. Additional evidence that profit shifting has increased over time is found from a comparison of business profits with economic output (gross domestic product) in the two country groups. MNC profits as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) in the traditional economies averaged from 1 % to 2 % between 1999 and 2008, while their profits in the tax preferred countries profits averaged 33 % of GDP in 2008, up from 27 % in 1999. Individual countries within the tax preferred group displayed more dramatic increases in the ratio of profits to GDP. For example, profits reported in Bermuda have increased from 260 % of that country’s GDP in 1999 to over 1000 % in 2008. In Luxembourg, American business profits went from 19 % of that country’s GDP in 1999 to 208 % of GDP in 2008. This report may be of interest to Members of Congress for at least four reasons. First, profit shifting has been the specific target of recent Congressional action, including a September 2012 hearing held by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, as well as several bills introduced in the 112 th Congress. Second, <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>provisions</b> have been included in general tax reform proposals in the 112 th Congress. Third, most general tax reform proposals would lower the top corporate rate which would diminish the incentive to shift profits. And fourth, to the extent that profit shifting is reduced, federal tax revenues would increase which could assist in addressing the country’s debt and deficit problems...|$|E
40|$|Addressing {{tax evasion}} and {{avoidance}} {{through use of}} tax havens {{has been the subject}} of a number of proposals in Congress and by the President. Actions by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the G- 20 industrialized nations also have addressed this issue. In the 111 th Congress, the HIRE Act (P. L. 111 - 147) included several anti-evasion provisions, and P. L. 111 - 226 included foreign tax credit provisions directed at perceived abuses by U. S. multinationals. Numerous legislative proposals to address both individual tax evasion and corporate tax avoidance have been advanced. Multinational firms can artificially shift profits from high-tax to low-tax jurisdictions using a variety of techniques, such as shifting debt to high-tax jurisdictions. Because tax on the income of foreign subsidiaries (except for certain passive income) is deferred until income is repatriated (paid to the U. S. parent as a dividend), this income can avoid current U. S. taxes, perhaps indefinitely. The taxation of passive income (called Subpart F income) has been reduced, perhaps significantly, through the use of hybrid entities that are treated differently in different jurisdictions. The use of hybrid entities was greatly expanded by a new regulation (termed check-the-box) introduced in the late 1990 s that had unintended consequences for foreign firms. In addition, earnings from income that is taxed often can be shielded by foreign tax credits on other income. On average, very little tax is paid on the foreign source income of U. S. firms. Ample evidence of a significant amount of profit shifting exists, but the revenue cost estimates vary substantially. Evidence also indicates a significant increase in corporate profit shifting over the past several years. Recent estimates suggest losses that may approach, or even exceed, $ 100 billion per year. Individuals can evade taxes on passive income, such as interest, dividends, and capital gains, by not reporting income earned abroad. In addition, because interest paid to foreign recipients is not taxed, individuals can evade taxes on U. S. source income by setting up shell corporations and trusts in foreign haven countries to channel funds into foreign jurisdictions. There is no general third-party reporting of income as is the case for ordinary passive income earned domestically; the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) relies on qualified intermediaries (QIs). In the past, these institutions certified nationality without revealing the beneficial owners. Estimates of the cost of individual evasion have ranged from $ 40 billion to $ 70 billion. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA; included in the HIRE Act, P. L. 111 - 147) introduced required information reporting by foreign financial intermediaries and withholding of tax if information is not provided. These provisions became effective only recently, and their consequences are not yet known. Most provisions to address profit shifting by multinational firms would involve changing the tax law: repealing or limiting deferral, limiting the ability of the foreign tax credit to offset income, addressing check-the-box, or even formula apportionment. President Obama’s proposals include a proposal to disallow overall deductions and foreign tax credits for deferred income, along with a number of other restrictions. Changes in the law or <b>anti-abuse</b> <b>provisions</b> have also been introduced in broader tax reform proposals. Provisions to address individual evasion include increased information reporting and provisions to increase enforcement, such as shifting the burden of proof to the taxpayer, increased penalties, and increased resources. Individual tax evasion is the main target of the HIRE Act, the proposed Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, and some other proposals...|$|E
