That {{the panel}} retains its {{original}} frame makes it especially interesting to art historians, apart from its aesthetic qualities. The canvas has suffered little paint loss, board cracking, or other damage, and has been cleaned several times since it came into the possession of the Groeningemuseum.|$|E
5|$|Steering may be {{supplied}} by a rider or, under certain circumstances, by the bike itself. This self-stability {{is generated by}} a combination of several effects that depend on the geometry, mass distribution, and forward speed of the bike.

A story {{considered}} for the fourth series, it would have seen Sarah Jane being captured by an alien, who uses her DNA to impersonate her, <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> her for stealing an important piece of alien merchandise. Sarah would have used her gadgets to fight her clone. This story however, was very similar to Sarah Jane in Prison, so it was scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} PC version of Elite Force gained critical acclaim, the 2001 PlayStation 2 port received a more negative reception. Majesco's port {{of the game}} garnered mediocre reviews, holding scores of 54 percent and 52 percent on Game Rankings and Metacritic respectively. While the level design, story and atmosphere were praised, critics were negative towards what was seen to be a poorly performed port, with complaints focused on difficult controls, graphical problems <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> rate issues. In addition, the artificial intelligence was deemed to be significantly worse than the earlier PC incarnation of the game. Several reviews suggested that Majesco had simply not put effort into the port, resulting in a level of quality behind that which was expected of PlayStation 2 games at the time.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Garfield as Sebastião Rodrigues (based on Giuseppe Chiara, {{who later}} in the film {{goes by the name}} Okada San'emon). In interviews, Garfield has spoken of his {{extensive}} year-long preparation for the role with James Martin, a practicing Jesuit priest working in New York. Garfield detailed that the preparation with Martin included extensive research and immersion in the Jesuit lifestyle <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> of mind which was felt to be essential to the accuracy of the film by the producers. Garfield, who is of slight to medium frame, reported losing 40 pounds to play the role following the rules of abstention which were outlined to him by Martin.|$|E

The pair also reveal that they, not Cotton, murdered her mother, Maureen, as she {{was having an affair}} with Billy's father, which drove his mother away. Gale, who survived the crash, intervenes, and Sidney takes {{advantage}} of this to turn the tables on her attackers, killing Stu. Randy is revealed to be wounded but alive. Billy attacks Sidney but she shoots him through the head, killing him. As the sun rises and police arrive, a badly injured Dewey is taken away by ambulance and Gale makes an impromptu news report about the night's events.|$|E
5|$|Blacklist {{graphics}} {{and lack of}} difficulty were criticized. McCaffrey found the visuals unimpressive and most character models to be ugly; he also noted technical problems, such as screen-tearing <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> rate issues. Bloodworth criticized the game's invisible wall and unresponsive controls in certain segments, although he thought those minor issues did not drag down its overall experience. McCaffrey noted that even when {{the game is played}} in perfectionist mode, it is less challenging than its predecessors. He thought Blacklist gave players too many rewards, making its universal-economy system a useless feature. Bloodworth was puzzled by the game's unlock system, which he said hindered its credibility.|$|E
5|$|Experimentation {{with real}} bikes {{has so far}} {{confirmed}} the weave mode predicted by the eigenvalues. It was found that tire slip <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> flex are not important for the lateral dynamics of the bicycle in the speed range up to 6 m/s. The idealized bike model {{used to calculate the}} eigenvalues shown here does not incorporate any of the torques that real tires can generate, and so tire interaction with the pavement cannot prevent the capsize mode from becoming unstable at high speeds, as Wilson and Cossalter suggest happens in the real world.|$|E

5|$|However, {{while he}} cares {{for the welfare}} of the people and of his family, Vayne is willing to use any means {{necessary}} to maintain order and retain power. He ensures the complete subjugation of Nabradia and Dalmasca and exterminates their royal families in order to acquire their deifacted nethicite. He confronts Dalmasca's resistance movement with absolute ruthlessness, accepting no surrender. He even {{goes so far as to}} murder his own ailing father <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> the Imperial senators, to put an end to their scheming against himself and Larsa, and to level cities in nethicite testing experiments. Vayne's ultimate goal is to free humanity from the control of the Occurians, a race of god-like beings that have for centuries secretly meddled with the course of human history.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Amtrak found {{itself with a}} supply of surplus Metroliner cars with {{problematic}} propulsion systems, but with sound body <b>and</b> <b>frame,</b> stored at their Wilmington and Bear shop complexes in Delaware. The coaches were, except for the propulsion systems, a near-identical match to Amfleet coaches. Twenty-nine of the 31 coaches were renumbered and used as cab control cars for corridor services. This allowed trains to operate in push-pull service, rather than needing to be turned around on a wye at terminals or to have a locomotive on each end.|$|E

40|$|This article {{critically}} reviews current <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> <b>framing</b> {{research in}} media and communication studies. It is first argued that most authors fail {{to distinguish between}} ‘frame’ and ‘framing’ and therewith produce a conceptual confusion and imprecision that is not conducive to the field. Second, {{it is argued that}} current <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> <b>framing</b> research ignore sociological research about news production and news audiences that reached its zenith in the 1980 s and is still conceptually and methodologically relevant to much current <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> <b>framing</b> research. As a result, a notion of power is absent from most current <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> <b>framing</b> research. By discussing — on the basis of key literature — what a news ‘frame’ is, how it comes about and how it is of consequence successively, these claims are substantiated and research directions for improving the field are indicated...|$|R

5|$|When Norfolk {{was first}} settled, homes {{were made of}} wood <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> construction, similar to most medieval English-style homes. These homes had wide {{chimneys}} and thatch roofs. Some decades after the town was first laid out in 1682, the Georgian architectural style, which was popular in the South at the time, was used. Brick was considered more substantial construction; patterns were made by brick laid and Flemish bond. This style evolved to include projecting center pavilions, Palladian windows, balustraded roof decks, and two-story porticoes. By 1740, homes, warehouses, stores, workshops, and taverns began to dot Norfolk's streets.|$|E

When he finds the plane, Baxter kills Carl, and engages in a gunfight with Hank. Hank manages to kill Baxter with the gun he had stolen. Hank starts to concoct another story to tell the authorities.

5|$|Mac {{shows her}} work to Beaver, which {{involves}} his new business project. Veronica, under a disguise, meets with the prom baby's temporary foster mom. Veronica learns that the baby's foster mother committed suicide {{and her father}} was in jail, hinting that the baby is Trina Echolls. Veronica talks to Trina and tells her the news of her parentage. Trina actually wants her story {{to go to the}} tabloids. However, a deaf lunch lady storms in and says that she's actually Trina's mother. The lunch lady says that Lianne was a friend who covered up her pregnancy to protect her. Trina's father is Principal Moorehead, and Trina confronts him about leaving her at the prom in front of many faculty. Veronica finds the dead rat that Keith picked up at the bus.

5|$|Phoenix Wright, a newly-hired defense {{attorney}} at the Fey and Co. law firm, agrees to represent {{his best friend}} Larry Butz, who {{has been charged with}} the murder of his girlfriend, Cindy Stone. With the help of his boss and mentor, Mia Fey, he proves that Frank Sahwit, the prosecution's star witness, is the real murderer. Shortly thereafter, Mia is killed in her office, and her younger sister Maya is arrested after the police find her name on a note left by Mia. Phoenix takes her case, facing off against Miles Edgeworth, an equally-talented prosecutor. Phoenix manages to identify Redd White, a professional blackmailer, as the real killer, only to find himself charged with the killing instead. Representing himself, he exposes White in court and gets justice for Mia. His reputation established, Phoenix takes on another case, this time defending Will Powers, the lead actor in a children's TV show, against accusations that he killed his co-star, Jack Hammer. In a bizarre twist, it is revealed that Dee Vasquez, the show's producer, committed the murder in self-defense after Hammer tried to kill her <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> Powers for her death.|$|E
5|$|Sercey's {{flagship}} {{during these}} operations was the 40-gun frigate Forte. Forte, commanded by the elderly Captain Hubert Le Loup de Beaulieu, {{had been built}} in 1794 based on the hull <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> of a ship of the line: the frigate weighed 1,400 tons bm, the largest purpose-built frigate at sea. The main battery of Forte consisted of 28 24-pounder long guns, only the second frigate ever built (after Pomone) which could manage such a heavy armament. This was augmented by fourteen 8-pounder long guns on the upper deck and eight 36-pounder carronades on the quarterdeck, totaling 52 heavy cannon complemented by eight 1-pounder swivel guns. Uniquely, {{the sides of the}} ship were lined with cork matting to prevent splinters while the more common precaution had been taken of stringing netting over the deck to protect the crew from falling debris. The ship was however weakened by an ill-disciplined crew, and Sercey had expressed doubts about the ability of the aged Beaulieu.|$|E
