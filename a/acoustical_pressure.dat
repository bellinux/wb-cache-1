40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects on the brain of multiple sessions of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption using focused ultrasound (FUS) in combination with micro-bubbles over a range of acoustic exposure levels. Six weekly sessions of FUS, using <b>acoustical</b> <b>pressures</b> between 0. 66 and 0. 80 MPa, were performed under magnetic resonance guidance. The success and degree of BBB disruption was estimated by signal enhancement of post-contrast T 1 -weighted imaging of the treated area. Histopathological analysis was performed after the last treatment. The consequences of repeated BBB disruption varied from no indications of vascular damage to signs of micro-hemorrhages, macrophage infiltration, micro-scar formations and cystic cavities. The signal enhancement on the contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted imaging had limited value for predicting small-vessel damage. T 2 -weighted imaging corresponded well with the effects on histopathology and could be used to study treatment effects over time. This study demonstrates that repeated BBB disruption by FUS can be performed with no or limited damage to the brain tissue...|$|R

40|$|The main {{topic of}} this work is the {{acoustical}} characterisation and the comparison calibration of a new low cost prototype of a pressure-velocity probe based on MEMS and CMOS technologies. The development during {{the last years of}} micro sensors using the double hot-wire anemometric transduction principle, has permitted to directly measure the velocity of the air particle, thus giving a fundamental contribution to the intensimetric measurements. This in turn required a more deep study of the calibration techniques as at least two <b>acoustical</b> signals (<b>pressure</b> and axial velocity) have to be processed simultaneously in order to obtain precise and affordable measurements of energetic properties of sound. In particular this work is devoted to the analysis and experimental validation of the "comparison calibration" methodology when applied to pressure-velocity probes still in their early stage of prototypes. After an introduction on the Acoustical Energetics, in which the main quantities are described and simulated for a monochromatic field, the next chapters are dedicated to the probe realised within the SIHT (Sogliano Industrial High Technology) project, which is based on the collaboration between the Institute of Acoustics and Sensors Corbino-CNR, of the CNR-IEIIT and of the Deltatech industry in Sogliano al Rubicone (FC, Italy). We describe the different prototypes that have been realised and their relative characterization, that have been useful to design new and improved prototypes. The particular geometry of the prototypes has also required a new procedure of comparison calibration, in which the probe under test is calibrated using a reference one, in a generic field. The possible applications of the new probe are various, and go from audiometric field to condition monitoring, and are investigated in the last chapter...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To {{explore the}} {{cardiovascular}} effects of nightlong repetitive arousals (RA). Methods. Twenty healthy subjects participated in two consecutive sleep studies. The {{first one was}} free of intervention and the second study involved repetitive arousals induced by <b>acoustical</b> stimuli. Blood <b>pressure,</b> heart rate variability (HRV), arterial stiffness index (ASI), and serum markers including nitric oxide (NO), endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were studied. Results. RA led to overnight elevation in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) but not in systolic blood pressure (SBP). Regarding HRV, overnight increase in low frequency power (LF) and low frequency to high frequency ratio (LHR) and decrease in high frequency power (HF) were evident. The relative overnight differences in HF and LHR correlated {{with the amount of}} rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. RA did not cause detectable change in either ASI or serum markers of interest. Conclusions. Nightlong RA alters the sympathovagal modulation significantly and this effect seems {{to be associated with the}} amount of REM sleep. Exposure to RA also causes an elevation in postsleep DBP. Disturbance to autonomic nervous system (ANS) may precede endothelial dysfunction and increased arterial stiffness as cardiovascular consequences of RA...|$|R
40|$|In single bubble {{following}} it's rapid collapse each {{cycle of}} oscillation of an ultrasonic field. Since widely varying length and time scales affect the bubble dynamics and optical emission processes, {{it is difficult}} to anticipate the importance of the effects of gravity present for observations on earth. Our bubble is driven in an acoustically resonating cavity at it's first harmonic mode. The <b>acoustical</b> radiation <b>pressure</b> (Bjerknes force) will then keep it suspended in the center near the pressure antinode. When driven in a region where the diffusive processes balance the bubble it acts in a nonlinear but regular way, emitting a short (approx. 200 ps) burst of light each acoustic cycle. Balancing the Bjerknes force with buoyancy, as in, we can see that the bubble should be displaced from the velocity node approximately 20 m at normal gravity. Therefore, water flows past the bubble at the time of collapse. Gravitation also changes the ambient pressure at the bubble's location, as Delta. P = rho. g. h this gives a change of approximately - 0. 5 % in our experiment when going from 1. 8 g to 0 g. Studies of ambient pressure changes were also done in order to assess these effects. Inside a pressure sealed chamber a spherical glass cell is filled with distilled water which has been degassed to 120 mmHg. A bubble is then trapped in the center and driven by a piezoelectric transducer at 32. 2 kHz attached {{to the side of the}} cell. An optical system is then set up to take strobbed video images along and light emission data simultaneously. Temperature, pressure, drive voltage, and listener voltage are also monitored. PMT output in Volts The radii of the bubbles for both experiment s are fit using the Rayleigh-Plesset equation and the acoustic drive amplitude and the ambient bubble radius are found. There is little change in the acoustic drive amplitude as we expect, since we are not varying the drive voltage. However. the ambient bubble radius goes up considerably. These changes (increased light output, increased maximum bubble radius, and increased ambient bubble radius) are also observed when the ambient pressure is varied in the laboratory by an amount similar to that due to gravitation. The changes in the ambient bubble radius and light output with a change in ambient pressure are predicted by the "dissociation hypothesis" and have been observed by other groups in the laboratory. It seems clear that buoyancy's effect on light output and bubble radius, are at best on the same order as the effects of ambient pressure...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: Welds had been made with the parameters adjusted to get the highest stability. In these conditions, were simulated instabilities that had been generated by the grease presence in the weld trajectory. In both experimental groups was acquired the <b>acoustical</b> <b>pressure</b> signal produced by electric arc to made analysis based in time domain and frequency domain. Findings: After this comparative study we conclude that the acoustical evaluation of the stability on the GMAW process presents more clarity for the analysis based in the time domain that the frequency domain. Research limitations/implications: In the gotten results, the time domain analysis method could represent adequately the stability and the instability of the process. The stability characterizes for the continuity and minim variation of the statistical parameters, but in the presence of instabilities, these parameters present chaotic changes. In the frequency domain method the variations are imperceptible for steady and unstable regions, but it presents little definite variations in the amplitude of determined bands of frequencies. Originality/value: The stability evaluation in welding is crucial because it is responsible in the weld quality. The non contact methods as the acoustical method have a potentiality extraordinary to monitoring and detect instabilities in welding.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{mounting}} a loudspeaker {{on one end}} of a sound-absorbing tube has existed since at least 1936. Surprisingly, a detailed mathematical analysis of the configuration has not been performed, nor has a design method been established. This configuration, known as a transmission line loudspeaker, has received little consideration in the reviewed literature. Instead, it has become frequently featured in magazines for audio hobbyists, where it is experimentally designed with rules seemingly derived from hearsay and described with terms of high praise. In this dissertation, an electro-acoustical model of a fiberglass-filled transmission line is presented. This model represents the transmission line as two separate lines [...] a mechanical line that models the mechanical motion of the fiberglass and an acoustical line that models the motion of the air. The lines are linked by the flow resistance of the fiberglass. From the model, solutions for the acoustic <b>pressure,</b> <b>acoustical</b> volume velocity of the air, mechanical velocity of the fiberglass fibers, and mechanical force on the fiberglass in the line are obtained. The fiberglass is characterized and empirical formulas that describe its characteristics are found. It is shown that the modeled input impedance to the transmission line is a good fit to measured data. The performance of the system is assessed by comparing it with the performances of typical loudspeaker mountings, i. e., the infinite baffle, the closed box, and the vented box. Finally, an example is shown of how the equations derived from the model can be used to evaluate the design of a transmission line loudspeaker system. Ph. D.
