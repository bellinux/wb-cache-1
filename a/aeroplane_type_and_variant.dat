HPV <b>type</b> <b>and</b> <b>variant</b> analyses were performed using PCR-based Luminex and dot-blot hybridization assays. Eighty-three percent of tumors were infected with at least one HPV type. European variants of HPV 16 / 18 were the most prevalent in tumors from all three regions, with all HPV 18 infections and 64 % of HPV 16 infections being of European lineage. A higher frequency of HPV 16 was present in Northern Tunisia (80 %) than in Central (68 %) or Southern Tunisia (50 %) (P ???=??? 0. 02). HPV 18 / 45 was significantly more common in adenocarcinomas (50 %) than in squamous cell carcinomas (11 %) (P ???=??? 0. 004). Frequent infection with European HPV variants most likely reflects the history of European migration to Tunisia. In addition to the importance of understanding the variants of HPV in Tunisia, behavioral and cultural attitudes towards screening and age-specific infection rates should be investigated to aid the development of future vaccination and HPV screening programs and policies.

40|$|Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the {{etiological}} {{agents of}} cervical {{cancer and other}} human malignancies. HPVs are classified into high- and low-risk genotypes according to their association with cancer. Host cell transformation by high-risk HPVs relies {{in part on the}} ability of the viral E 6 protein to induce the degradation of p 53. We report the development of a cellular assay that accurately quantifies the p 53 degradation activity of E 6 in vivo, based on the fusion of p 53 to Renilla luciferase (RLuc-p 53). This assay was used to measure the p 53 degradation activities of E 6 proteins from 29 prevalent HPV <b>types</b> <b>and</b> <b>variants</b> of HPV <b>type</b> 16 (HPV 16) and HPV 33 by determining the amount of E 6 expression vector required to reduce by half the levels of RLuc-p 53 (50 % effective concentration [EC 50]). These studies revealed an unexpected variability in the p 53 degradation activities of different E 6 proteins, even among active types whose EC 50 s span more than 2 log units. Differences in activity were greater between <b>types</b> than between <b>variants</b> <b>and</b> did not correlate with differences in the intracellular localization of E 6, with most being predominantly nuclear. Protein and mRNA expression of the 29 E 6 proteins was also examined. For 16 high-risk types, spliced transcripts that encode shorter E 6 *I proteins of variable sizes and abundances were detected. Mutation of the splice donor site in five different E 6 proteins increased their p 53 degradation activity, suggesting that mRNA splicing can limit the activity of some high-risk E 6 types. The quantification of p 53 degradation in vivo represents a novel tool to systematically compare the oncogenic potentials of E 6 proteins from different HPV <b>types</b> <b>and</b> <b>variants...</b>|$|R
