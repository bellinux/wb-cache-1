25|$|In 1936, {{deprived}} of morphine for some days, he borrowed a shotgun on {{the pretext of}} killing a snake and {{shot himself in the}} chest. The wound was not fatal, and Marais therefore put the gun barrel in his mouth <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> He did so on the farm Pelindaba, belonging to his friend Gustav Preller. For those who are familiar with the dark moods of certain of Marais' poems, there is a black irony here; in Zulu, Pelindaba means 'the end of the business' â€“ although the more common interpretation is 'Place of great gatherings'.|$|E
25|$|By all accounts, Smith was a well-respected and even-tempered man. However Bogan's taunts {{began to}} wear on Smith, who {{eventually}} climbed down from his wagon and headed toward Bogan. As Smith walked toward Bogan, the latter stuck his hand into his coat. Smith told {{him that if he}} pulled his gun, he'd knock him to the ground. Bogan did pull his pistol, at which point Smith did knock him down with one punch. The two then wrestled briefly before Smith was able to take the young man's gun from him. As he did this, Kemp ran over producing his own handgun, and hit Smith {{in the back of the}} head. Smith then turned and pointed his pistol at Kemp, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> However, the pistol misfired, according to witnesses, and Kemp fled at top speed. Smith turned Bogan's pistol over to the town marshal.|$|E

Initial reports {{stated that the}} airmen was killed by an accidental discharge of a gun being cleaned by another airman; however in February 2007, {{it was reported that}} Airman 1st Class Kyle J. Dalton, of the 15th Security Forces Squadron, Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, had been charged on 30 November 2007 with one count of murder and failure to obey a lawful order in relation to the shooting. Dalton also faced a charge of assault for a separate incident that occurred on 30 June 2006 involving Ware and another airman. Dalton, who was deployed in the Middle East at the time the charges were brought, had an Article 32 hearing and was Court-martialed on 23 April 2007 at Langley Air Force Base. As part of a plea bargain deal, Dalton pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and violating a lawful general regulation by drawing or aiming a firearm when deadly force was unnecessary. Dalton was sentenced to 10 years in prison, given a dishonorable discharge, reduced in rank from Senior Airman to Airman Basic and ordered to forfeit all pay and allowances. Dalton admitted to the court that he tracked Ware with his pistol in the barracks <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> thinking the weapon was unloaded. He also admitted that he had previously aimed a loaded M-4 carbine at another airman.|$|E

The Coroner's Office ruled it a suicide, and the Martin County Sheriff's Office deemed it a [...] "pretty {{clear-cut}} case". However, many Florida locals had their doubts. [...] "If it were [...] a suicide, why did he do a head shot instead of a chest shot?" [...] asked Bessie DuBois. The theory was that he stuck the shotgun in the ground, leaned over <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger,</b> even though it would have taken considerable effort and flexibility on Nelson's part.|$|E

McDonald also said that Oswald struck him, but that he struck back and Oswald was disarmed. As he was led from the theater, Oswald shouted he was a victim of police brutality.|$|E

One of the attackers pointed a gun at the victim <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> several times but no shot went off; nonetheless, Demiral suffered a heart-attack and died at the scene of the crime. Two months later, on May 28, 1993, four neo-Nazi German men set fire to the house of a Turkish family in Solingen. Three girls and two women died and 14 other members of the extended family were severely injured in the attack. The Solingen arson attack led to protests in several cities and many ethnic Germans participated in large demonstrations to condemn the attack. The attack and demonstrations were highly publicised by the German and Turkish media. However, the German Chancellor Helmut Kohl did not attend the memorial services - for which he was criticised by the public and the media.|$|E
