5|$|Jaffe {{noted that}} the low-tech method of {{suspending}} actors by wires helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few wires {{had to be removed}} digitally in post-production; sets were constructed so that the harsh lighting obscured wires, and entire sets were constructed on their sides so that by pulling actors {{up and down on the}} rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These sets were on gimbals so that the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down <b>a</b> <b>corridor</b> by phaser blasts was simulated by positioning the camera at the bottom of <b>a</b> <b>corridor</b> set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, so that the camera looked up towards the ceiling. In this position, the wires were hidden by the actors as they ascended the corridor.|$|E

50|$|The Great Eastern Ranges Initiative is {{a program}} {{bringing}} together people and organisations to establish <b>a</b> conservation <b>corridor</b> along the New South Wales section of the Great Eastern Ranges. <b>A</b> conservation <b>corridor</b> is <b>a</b> strategically located area of land that links key habitats for plants and animals. While <b>a</b> wilderness <b>corridor</b> is <b>an</b> area in a relatively untouched natural environment, <b>a</b> conservation <b>corridor</b> may encompass <b>a</b> range of land uses — including agriculture, industry and human settlement — in addition to areas protected as national parks or reserves.|$|R

5|$|The tender {{included}} <b>a</b> <b>corridor</b> {{connection and}} tunnel {{through the water}} tank giving access to the locomotive cab from the train so that the driver and fireman could be changed without stopping the train. The following year the locomotive appeared in the film The Flying Scotsman.|$|E
5|$|Around midday the Germans {{opened up}} an {{artillery}} and mortar barrage that caused casualties among the ridge's defenders and lasted {{for the entire}} afternoon. At about the same time, Kampfgruppe Weidinger seized an important road junction northeast of Coudehard. Several units of the 10th SS, 12th SS, and 116th Panzer Divisions managed to clear <b>a</b> <b>corridor</b> past Point 262N, and by mid afternoon about 10,000 German troops had passed out of the pocket.|$|E
5|$|At a {{hotel in}} Richmond, Virginia, Chester Ray Banton (Tony Shalhoub) walks along <b>a</b> <b>corridor</b> up to reach a door, which he then frantically knocks on while {{shouting}} the name ″Morris″. Banton's shouts {{attract the attention of}} Patrick Newirth, a guest in the room across the hall. When Newirth looks through his room door's peephole, Banton steps back, causing his body shadow slips beneath the door. Newirth suddenly evaporates, leaving a strange burn mark on the floor. Banton realizes what has happened and flees the scene.|$|E
50|$|The tomb is {{unfinished}} and consists only {{of an open}} entryway, <b>a</b> first <b>corridor</b> and {{the beginning}} of <b>a</b> second <b>corridor.</b> <b>A</b> pit quarried just inside the second corridor might have functioned as a place of interment. The first corridor has decoration and texts indicating the occupant was a prince.|$|R

50|$|The short North Carolina Highway 69 (NC 69) takes <b>Corridor</b> <b>A</b> {{north to}} U.S. Route 64 (US 64) near Hayesville. <b>Corridor</b> <b>A</b> turns east on US 64, and after some two-lane sections, it becomes <b>a</b> four-lane highway. <b>Corridor</b> <b>A</b> {{switches}} to US 23 near Franklin, and meets {{the east end}} of Corridor K near Sylva. From Sylva to its end at I-40 near Clyde, <b>Corridor</b> <b>A</b> uses the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway, which carries US 23 most of the way and US 74 for its entire length.|$|R
5|$|At about noon, {{several hundred}} special constables were led onto the field. They formed two {{lines in the}} crowd a few yards apart, {{in an attempt to}} form <b>a</b> <b>corridor</b> through the crowd between the house where the magistrates were {{watching}} and the hustings, two waggons lashed together. Believing that this might be intended as the route by which the magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest the speakers, some members of the crowd pushed the waggons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings to form a human barrier.|$|E
5|$|On the June 30 {{episode of}} Raw, Swagger turned {{face for the}} first time in WWE, after he and Colter would confront Rusev and Lana about them disrespecting America. This would lead to a number of matches between the two, with Swagger being {{defeated}} by Rusev at both Battleground and SummerSlam. On the December 1 episode of Raw, Swagger would find Colter beaten up in <b>a</b> <b>corridor,</b> with Rusev later admitting to the attack. At , Swagger would challenge Rusev for the United States Championship, in a losing effort and ending their feud.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Manstein {{was promised}} four panzer divisions. Due to German {{reluctance}} to weaken certain sectors by redeploying German units, {{the task of}} opening <b>a</b> <b>corridor</b> to the German 6th Army fell to the 4th Panzer Army. The German force was pitted against several Soviet armies tasked with {{the destruction of the}} encircled German forces and their offensive around the lower Chir River.|$|E
50|$|One common {{example of}} bird species' ranges are land mass areas {{bordering}} water bodies, such as oceans, rivers, or lakes; {{they are called}} a coastal strip. A second example, some species of bird depend on water, usually a river, swamp, etc., or water related forest and live in <b>a</b> river <b>corridor.</b> <b>A</b> separate example of <b>a</b> river <b>corridor</b> would be <b>a</b> river <b>corridor</b> that includes the entire drainage, having {{the edge of the}} range delimited by mountains, or higher elevations; the river itself would be a smaller percentage of this entire wildlife corridor, but the corridor is created because of the river.|$|R
5000|$|In architecture, {{the term}} [...] "double-loaded" [...] {{describes}} corridors that connects to rooms on both sides. Conversely, <b>a</b> single-loaded <b>corridor</b> only has rooms {{on one side}} (and possible windows on the other). <b>A</b> blind <b>corridor</b> doesn't lead anywhere.|$|R

5|$|Significant {{severe weather}} was ongoing {{at the start}} of April 27 and {{continued}} for the entire day virtually unbroken. For the second day in a row, the SPC issued a high risk of severe weather for the Southern United States, and late that morning the SPC increased the probability for tornadoes to 45 percent along <b>a</b> <b>corridor</b> from Meridian, Mississippi, to Huntsville, Alabama, an extremely rare issuance exceeding the high risk standards. Conditions for tornadoes became increasingly favorable for an extreme tornado outbreak.|$|E
5|$|The {{kingdom of}} the East Angles was bordered {{to the north and}} east by the North Sea, to the south by mainly impenetrable forests and by the Fens marshes on its western border. The main land route from East Anglia would at that time have been <b>a</b> <b>corridor,</b> along which ran the prehistoric Icknield Way. The Devil's Dyke (near modern Newmarket) may have at one time formed part of the kingdom's western boundary, but its {{construction}} cannot be dated accurately enough to establish it as of Anglo-Saxon origin.|$|E
5|$|The west wing's {{design is}} known only from archival records, {{since it was}} almost totally {{destroyed}} between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. The {{first part of the}} wing consisted of stables, a spiral staircase leading to the exterior façade, <b>a</b> <b>corridor</b> linking the courtyard to the street and a large pantry. During the seventeenth century, the second part held an indoor jeu de paume court and a chapel; its first floor had three large bedrooms.|$|E
50|$|The BRT Standard {{creates a}} {{concrete}} “minimum standard”, identifying several critical design elements {{that must be}} present for <b>a</b> <b>corridors</b> to qualify as BRT. For each element, a best practice is identified, along with benchmarks for partial achievement of the feature.|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, CDIA {{completed}} the Urban Transport Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) that devised a 20-year urban transport plan, with a 10-year [...] "action plan." [...] The CDIA studied two <b>corridors,</b> <b>an</b> east-west <b>corridor,</b> and <b>a</b> north-south <b>corridor.</b> CDIA {{recommended that the}} east-west corridor be constructed first, along Peshawar's east-west axis along the Grand Trunk Road, {{with most of the}} city's development concentrated within a few kilometers of the road.|$|R
50|$|While {{the highway}} is short, it is <b>a</b> very {{important}} <b>corridor,</b> serving as <b>a</b> fast route from Tucson and Phoenix (via I-10) to the Mexican border. The highway is {{a portion of}} the United States section of the CANAMEX <b>Corridor,</b> <b>a</b> trade <b>corridor</b> that stretches north from Mexico across the United States to the Canadian province of Alberta.|$|R
5|$|While {{the core}} was under construction, <b>a</b> <b>corridor</b> was left open {{leading into the}} shaft where the grave chamber was built {{separately}} and later covered by leftover stone blocks and debris. This construction strategy is clearly visible in later unfinished pyramids, in particular the Pyramid of Neferefre. This technique also reflects the older style from the 3rd Dynasty seemingly coming back into fashion after being temporarily abandoned by the builders of the five great pyramids at Dahshur and Giza during the 4th Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Alcatraz cellhouse had <b>a</b> <b>{{corridor}}</b> {{naming system}} named after major American streets and landmarks. Michigan Avenue was {{the corridor to}} the side of A-Block, and Broadway was the central corridor in which the inmates would assemble as they massed through Times Square (an area with a clock on the wall), before entering the dining hall for their meals. Broadway separated Block-B and Block-C and prisoners kept along it had the least privacy in the prison. The corridor between Block-C and the library was called Park Avenue. The corridor in D-Block was named Sunset Strip. Gun galleries lay {{at the end of each}} block, including the West and East Gun Galleries.|$|E
5|$|By 4:00 AM on October 16, Reshef's brigade, {{which had}} begun the {{operation}} with 97 tanks, had lost 56 in just twelve hours of fighting, leaving only 41 remaining. Although seizing the crossing site had been accomplished easily, stiff resistance had prevented Reshef from achieving his remaining objectives, namely opening the routes to the canal and securing <b>a</b> <b>corridor.</b> Reshef's force would further drop to just 27 tanks by noon. As a whole, Sharon's division suffered some 300 killed and 1,000 wounded that night. To help Reshef secure the corridor, Sharon supplied him with two tank battalions by 6:00 PM, propping his numbers up to 81 tanks.|$|E
50|$|The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) is {{planning}} a Trans-Asian Railway that will link Europe and the Pacific, with <b>a</b> Northern <b>Corridor</b> from Europe to the Korean Peninsula, <b>a</b> Southern <b>Corridor</b> from Europe to Southeast Asia, and <b>a</b> North-South <b>corridor</b> from Northern Europe to the Persian Gulf. All these would encounter breaks of gauge as they cross Asia. Current plans have mechanized facilities at the breaks of gauge to move containers from train to train rather than widespread gauge conversion.|$|R
50|$|Winnipeg RT is a bus {{rapid transit}} system in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, {{currently}} consisting of the Southwest Transitway. Future expansions consisting of <b>an</b> Eastern <b>Corridor</b> connecting downtown to Transcona and <b>a</b> West-North <b>Corridor</b> connecting St. James with Downtown and West Kildonan are in the planning stages.|$|R
50|$|Building bike trails on rail {{corridors}} {{has occurred}} in limited examples, however developing rail right of ways for a bike trail can restrict <b>a</b> train <b>corridor</b> to <b>a</b> single track. Also reclaiming <b>a</b> railway <b>corridor</b> to use trains again, that have become bike paths, limits the use of double tracks. The bike path is usually where the second track would be. An example of <b>a</b> bike, single-track <b>corridor</b> is the E&N Railway in Victoria, Canada.|$|R
5|$|Due to its nature, {{the episode}} {{featured}} many dangerous stunts utilizing fire. In {{the scene where}} Mulder and L'Ively confront each other {{at either end of}} <b>a</b> <b>corridor</b> in the Marsden family home, and L'Ively sets fire to the entire hallway, Mark Sheppard, who played L'Ively, ducked out of the shot in order to protect himself from the intense heat. The only injury involved in the production was when David Duchovny burned his hand, leaving a small permanent scar. The character of Phoebe Green was considered as a recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance.|$|E
5|$|Eastern Shore Memorial Hospital is a {{hospital}} located in Sheet Harbour. Construction began in 1947, and was opened on May 24, 1949. It is {{owned and operated}} by the Capital District Health Authority, which amalgamated into the Nova Scotia Health Authority in 2015. It has sixteen beds for patients. There is a cenotaph and gardens in front of the site where Duncan MacMillan Nursing Home (DMNH) once stood. The hospital offers quite a few services. It is connected to Harbourview Lodge, a nursing home, by <b>a</b> <b>corridor.</b> Harbourview Lodge was built in 2011 to replace DMNH, which was nearing the end of its life span.|$|E
5|$|Even though Champollion {{was appalled}} by the rampant looting of ancient {{artefacts}} and destruction of monuments, the expedition {{also contributed to the}} destruction. Most notably, while studying the Valley of the Kings, he damaged KV17, the tomb of Seti I, by removing a wall panel of 2.26 x 1.05m in <b>a</b> <b>corridor.</b> English explorers attempted to dissuade the destruction of the tomb, but Champollion persisted, stating that he had the permission of the Muhammad Ali Pasha. Champollion also carved his name into a pillar at Karnak. In a letter to the Pasha recommended that tourism, excavation and trafficking of artefacts be strictly controlled. Champollion's suggestions may have led to Muhammad Ali's 1835 ordinance prohibiting all exports of antiquities and ordering the construction of a museum in which to house the ancient artifacts.|$|E
