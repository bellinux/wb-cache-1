40|$|The {{distribution}} of chromogranin A and secretogranin I (chromogranin B) in normal and neoplastic human endocrine tissues was analyzed with two human monoclonal antibodies against chromogranin A, <b>anti-bovine</b> <b>antiserum</b> against chromogranin A, and an anti-rat antiserum against secretogranin I. Western blotting analyses showed both chromogranin A and secretogranin I in normal adrenals, pheochromocytomas, a pituitary adenoma, and in normal pituitary glands, {{but not in}} a bladder carcinoma. Rat adrenal medullary and anterior pituitary tissues reacted with the polyclonal chromogranin A and secretogranin I antisera, but not with the two monoclonal chromogranin A antibodies. All antibodies reacted with most of the neuroendocrine cells and tumors examined. Pituitary prolactinomas contained immunoreactive secretogranin I, but not chromogranin A. Analysis of the {{distribution of}} chromogranin A and secretogranin I in pancreatic islet cells showed that chromogranin A was found predominantly in the glucagon-producing A cells, whereas secretogranin I was present in less than 5 % of islet cells. These results indicate that chromogranin A and secretogranin I are both useful in the characterization of some neuroendocrine cells and neoplasms...|$|E
40|$|A {{radioimmunoassay}} for {{rhesus monkey}} and human im-munoreactive parathyrin {{was developed in}} which a se-lected <b>anti-bovine</b> parathyrin <b>antiserum,</b> radioiodinated purified bovine parathyrin tracer, and human parathyroid tissue-culture media standards were used. The resulting data indicate that (a) the method is sensitive, specific, accurate and reproducible; (b) it is valid for both the rhesus monkey and the human; (C) the serum immunoreactive parathyrin concentration of the monkey {{is essentially the same}} as that in man; (d) monkey immunoreactive para-thyrin responds to changes in serum calcium concen-tration similarly to that in man; and (e) the rhesus monkey is therefore a suitable species in which to study parathyroid physiology, from which conclusions {{can be applied to the}} human...|$|R
40|$|Western {{blotting}} of bovine β-LG {{is a valid}} {{method to}} detect adulteration by pasteurized bovine milk, by UHT bovine milk, or by heat-denatured bovine whey proteins in cheeses made of milk from other species. Use of PAGE of whey or isoelectric focusing of β-LG isolated from the casein fraction was followed by immunodetection with <b>anti-bovine</b> β-LG <b>antiserum.</b> The selectivity of the antisera to react with native and denatured β-LG was studied. Detection limits of native and denatured β-LG standard solutions were 10 and 50 pg/μl, respectively. Immunoblotting of the native-PAGE plates of whey proteins from cheese allows detection of bovine heat-denatured whey proteins or pasteurized bovine milk added to cheese even at 1 % can be detected by either Western blotting methods.

40|$|ABSTRACT A 1. 2 -kilobase (kb) cDNA clone (NF 68) {{encoding}} {{the mouse}} 68, 000 -mol-wt neurofilament protein is described. The clone was isolated from a mouse brain cDNA library by low-stringency cross-hybridization with a cDNA probe encoding mouse glial fibrillary acidic protein (Lewis et al., 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 81 : 2743 - 2746). The identity of NF 68 {{was established by}} hybrid selection using mouse brain polyA ÷ mRNA, and cell-free translation of the selected mRNA species. The cell-free translation product co-migrated with authentic 68, 000 -mol-wt neurofilament protein on an SDS/polyacrylamide gel, and was immunoprecipitable with a monospecific rabbit <b>anti-bovine</b> neurofilament <b>antiserum.</b> In addition, DNA sequence analysis of NF 68 showed 90 % homology at the amino acid level compared with the sequence of the porcine 68, 000 -mol-wt neurofilament protein. At high stringency, NF 68 detects a single genomic sequence encoding the mouse 68, 000 -mol-wt neurofilament protein. Two mRNA species of 2. 5 kb and 4. 0 kb are transcribed from the single gene in mouse brain. The level of expression of these mRNAs remains almost constant in postnatal mouse brains of all ages and, indeed, in the adult. At reduced stringency, NF 68 detects a number of mRNAs that are expressed in mouse brain, one of which encodes the 150, 000 -mol-wt neurofilamen...|$|R

40|$|Patients with IgA {{nephropathy}} show an {{emergence of}} IgA dominant {{circulating immune complexes}} (CIC) as well as increased levels of serum IgA and/or IgA bearing peripheral blood lymphocytes. In order to elucidate immunological aberrations responsible for the increased IgA synthesis in such patients, quantitative and qualitative analysis was performed on T alpha cells which have been recently identified as possessing IgA specific helper activity on human B cells. Three different methods were employed to quantitate T alpha cells. These methods included a rosette formation of T cells with either bovine red cells coated with the IgA fraction of <b>anti-bovine</b> red cell <b>antiserum</b> or those coated with TNP and anti-TNP IgA antibody, and an analysis of T cells combined with fluorescein conjugated human IgA myeloma protein. T alpha cells were sorted by a fluorescence activated cell sorter and co-cultured with a B cell rich fraction to evaluate {{whether there is a}} qualitative difference in IgA specific helper activity between patients and healthy adults. T alpha cells were significantly increased in patients with IgA nephropathy while there were no significant changes in patients with chronic proliferative glomerulonephritis without mesangial deposition of IgA. There was no qualitative difference in IgA specific helper activity of T alpha cells between patients and healthy adults. It is suggested that increased levels of T alpha cells in patients with IgA nephropathy may be responsible for increased synthesis of IgA in such patients...|$|R
40|$|The chick kidney {{mitochondrial}} iron [...] sulphur protein (ferredoxin), {{a component}} of the NADPH [...] cytochrome P- 450 reductase functional in the 1 alpha-hydroxylation of 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol, was purified to homogeneity by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, gel filtration on Sephadex G- 100 and preparative electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel. A novel NADPH [...] cytochrome c reductase assay utilizing crude renal NADPH [...] ferredoxin reductase was used for the detection of the ferredoxin. A mol. wt. of 53 000 was determined by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and by Sephadex G- 100 gel filtration of the 125 I-labelled ferredoxin. The ferredoxin has a sedimentation constant (S 20, w) of 2. 66 S, an A 411 /A 280 of 0. 4, and a molar absorptivity of 7300 cm- 1. M- 1. The electron-paramagnetic-resonance spectrum after reduction with Methyl Viologen and dithionite was characteristic of ferredoxins with signals at g = 1. 956 and 2. 025. Two iron and two labile sulphur atoms per molecule of ferredoxin were released by acid. Ouchterlony immunodiffusion tests by using goat <b>anti-(bovine</b> adrenal ferredoxin) <b>antiserum</b> showed precipitin reactions with the bovine adrenal ferredoxin and the chick renal ferredoxin as antigens, suggesting that the renal ferredoxin shares antigenic determinants(s) with the natural adrenal antigen. Amino acid analysis showed that {{of the total number of}} residues per molecule of ferredoxin, glutamic acid and aspartic acid are the most abundant residues, comprising 17 and 15 % respectively...|$|R
