I say that you, Ruth Tredgett, {{have been a}} most discreditable person, and {{you ought to be}} heartily <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> Ruth Tredgett; and as a clergymen of the Church of England I feel bound to tell you that—that your life has been—has been what God knows it couldn't well have helped being under the circumstances.|$|E

500|$|On 20 October 2010, {{following}} a live BBC News at Six report outside Parliament covering the 2010 Spending Review, Robinson silently took the anti-war, anti-cuts placard {{that had been}} waved directly behind him throughout, broke it in two and stamped on it. Afterwards, another protester, who had climbed {{the steps of the}} gantry where the BBC were broadcasting to film the protest on a mobile phone, said: [...] "You should be <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> mate. Shame on you!" [...] Robinson replied [...] "I'm not remotely ashamed of myself. Why should I be ashamed of myself?" [...] He wrote in his blog afterwards: [...] "I lost my temper and I regret that. However, as I explained afterwards to the protesters who disrupted my broadcast, there are many opportunities to debate whether the troops should be out of Afghanistan without the need to stick a sign on a long pole and wave it in front of a camera". Some days later, Robinson read out a jokily ambiguous [...] "letter of apology" [...] on the comedy game show Have I Got News for You, broadcast on 4 November 2010.|$|E

6000|$|The old butler, however, was not {{thinking}} of her; he had thoughts of a simpler order in his mind. He was reflecting that he had once valeted the nephew of the late Lord Justice Hawthorn, {{and in the midst}} of this low-class business the reminiscence brought him refreshment. Over and over to himself he conned these words: [...] "I interpylated in between them, and I says, 'You ought to be <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> yourself; call <b>yourself</b> an Englishman, I says, attackin' of old men and women with cold steel, I says!'" [...] And suddenly he saw that Hughs was in the dock.|$|R
6000|$|... "Won't {{you let me}} {{offer you}} some refreshment, Mr. Hall?" [...] said Christie, rising, with a slight color. [...] "I'm really <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> my {{forgetfulness}} again, but I'm afraid it's partly YOUR fault for entertaining me to the exclusion <b>of</b> <b>yourself.</b> No, thank you, let me fetch it for you." ...|$|R
500|$|The SCLC's {{goals were}} {{to fill the}} jails with protesters to force the city {{government}} to negotiate as demonstrations continued. However, not enough people were arrested to affect {{the functioning of the}} city and the wisdom of the plans were being questioned in the black community. The editor of The Birmingham World, the city's black newspaper, called the direct actions by the demonstrators [...] "wasteful and worthless", and urged black citizens to use the courts to change the city's racist policies. Most white residents of Birmingham expressed shock at the demonstrations. White religious leaders denounced King and the other organizers, saying that [...] "a cause should be pressed in the courts and the negotiations among local leaders, and not in the streets". Some white Birmingham residents were supportive as the boycott continued. When one black woman entered Loveman's department store to buy her children Easter shoes, a white saleswoman said to her, [...] "Negro, ain't you <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> your people out there on the street getting put in jail and you in here spending money and I'm not going to sell you any, you'll have to go some other place." [...] King promised a protest every day until [...] "peaceful equality had been assured" [...] and expressed doubt that the new mayor would ever voluntarily desegregate the city.|$|E
