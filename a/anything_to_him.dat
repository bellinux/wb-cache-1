25|$|Carl {{attempts}} {{to take over}} Phil's businesses while he is in hospital, and after Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) challenges him, she mysteriously disappears. Carl {{attempts to}} reconcile with Kirsty but she rejects him. However, she later approaches him and they have sex, but he sees her stealing £1000 from him the next morning. On the day of Max's trial, Ian fails to turn up, and Max is released without charge, to Carl's fury. Max and Phil then kidnap Carl and Phil offers Max the chance to kill him. Max declines and leaves, so Phil prepares to kill him instead until Carl implies that he caused harm to Shirley and knows where she is. He leads Phil to a block of run-down flats where Shirley is staying with her sister, Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White). It is revealed that Carl threatened Shirley {{to stay away from}} Walford or he would harm Phil's family. Carl leaves, but Phil confronts him later. Carl declares that he has contacts inside prison who can harm his son if Phil does <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Carl then tells Max that he had sex with Kirsty while he was in prison, leading to Max ending his relationship with Kirsty.|$|E
25|$|Chen Biao {{requested}} {{to serve in}} the military just like his father before him, and was placed in command of 500 troops. He was eager to win the hearts of his soldiers so he treated them well and they were willing to die for him. Once, there was an incident of grand theft and the suspect was Shi Ming (施明), a soldier from the Wunan (無難) camp. Shi Ming had been arrested and interrogated, but he remained fierce, refused to reveal the truth, and even expressed his willingness to die. The Minister of Justice (廷尉) was unable to do <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Sun Quan heard that Chen Biao understood a soldier's mentality well so he ordered Chen to take up Shi Ming's case. Chen Biao had Shi Ming released from his shackles and allowed him to take a bath and have a change of clothes, and treated him to a feast. Shi Ming was so touched by Chen Biao's generous treatment that he confessed to the crime and named his accomplices. Sun Quan was very surprised and impressed with Chen Biao, so he granted a special pardon to Shi Ming to protect Chen's reputation – because Chen would be labelled as a hypocrite if Shi were to be executed after confessing under Chen's kind treatment. Shi Ming's accomplices, on the other hand, were not so lucky as they were all executed. Shi Ming mended his ways and gradually rose through the ranks to become a general in Eastern Wu.|$|E
25|$|Phil and Sharon reunite {{after her}} {{relationship}} with Jack ends. However, it ends when Sharon's painkiller addiction puts Lexi in danger. Lola regains full custody of Lexi, leaving Phil feeling lonely. When Shirley's benefits are cut and she is forced {{to move out of}} the B, Phil secretly pays her rent. Shirley finds out and believes he is doing it so she will stay quiet about his involvement in Heather's death. Shirley demands money from Phil, which he does not have, forcing him to accept a deal from newcomer Carl White (Daniel Coonan). Carl wants to depose Phil as the top man in Albert Square, so as they drive off to a deal Carl says he has arranged, Carl deliberately crashes the car after releasing Phil's seatbelt, causing Phil to be thrown through the windscreen. He is airlifted to hospital and requires an operation. While he is recovering, he puts his cousin Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) in charge of his businesses. Carl tries to intimidate her and use the garage for illegal purposes. Shirley confronts Carl about his actions, and she mysteriously disappears after this, though her friends believe she has gone to Greece as she had planned. Once recovered, Phil learns that Carl is framing Max Branning (Jake Wood) for causing the car crash, and is using Ian as a false witness. Phil kidnaps Ian on the day of Max's trial so he cannot testify, and then kidnaps Carl once Max is acquitted. Phil prepares to kill Carl, but Carl implies that he caused harm to Shirley. He takes Phil to a block of run-down flats where Shirley is staying with her sister Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White). It is revealed that Carl threatened Shirley to stay away from Walford or he would harm Phil's family. Carl leaves, and Phil pleads with Shirley to return to Walford. They return together, then Phil confronts Carl. Carl declares that he has contacts inside prison who can harm Ben if Phil does <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

[...] Toward {{the end of the}} film, Luke speaks to God, evoking the conversation between God and Jesus at the Garden of Gethsemane, depicted in the Gospel of Luke. Following Luke's talk, the film depicts Dragline as a Judas, who delivers Luke to the authorities, trying to convince him to surrender. In the final scene, Dragline eulogizes Luke. He explains that despite Luke's death, his actions succeeded in defeating the system. The closing shot shows inmates working on crossroads with the repaired photo of Luke and the two women superimposed.|$|E
500|$|Christian Scientists {{call this}} [...] "the fall in Lynn," [...] {{and see it}} as the birth of their religion. Decades later Eddy wrote that, on the third day after the fall, she had been helped by reading a certain Bible passage. In several editions of Science and Health she {{identified}} it as Mark 3, but later said that it had been Matthew 9:2–8, a passage about Jesus healing the paralytic at Capernaum: [...] "As I read, the healing Truth dawned upon my sense; and the result was that I rose, dressed myself, and ever after was in better health than I had before enjoyed." [...] The physician who treated her at the time, Alvin M. Cushing, swore in an affidavit in 1907 that the injury had not been a serious one, and that Eddy had responded to morphine and a homeopathic remedy; she had not said <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> about a miraculous healing.|$|E

[...] In his junior year in 2000, he was a second-team All-American and first-team All-Conference USA, as he set school records by hitting three home runs in one game and 19 for the season; still, he went undrafted. [...] "He was kind of a square-shaped body, a guy [...] in a uniform didn't look all that athletic", Cleary said. [...] "He wasn't a tall, prospect-y looking guy. He looked chubby in a uniform. ...

2500|$|Cobb {{was having}} a {{tremendous}} year in 1911, which included a 40-game hitting streak. Still, [...] "Shoeless" [...] Joe Jackson led him by [...]009 points in the batting race late in the season. Near {{the end of the}} season, Cobb's Tigers had a long series against Jackson's Cleveland Naps. Fellow Southerners Cobb and Jackson were personally friendly {{both on and off the}} field. Cobb used that friendship to his advantage. Cobb ignored Jackson when Jackson tried to say <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> When Jackson persisted, Cobb snapped angrily back at him, making him wonder what he could have done to enrage Cobb. Cobb felt that it was these mind games that caused Jackson to [...] "fall off" [...] to a final average of [...]408, twelve points lower than Cobb's [...]420, a twentieth-century record which stood until George Sisler tied it and Rogers Hornsby surpassed it with [...]424, the record since then except for Hugh Duffy's [...]438 in the nineteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was under}} intense family {{pressure}} {{to end the}} relationship. Her children were embarrassed by her closeness with Tchaikovsky. There was society gossip about the composer and [...] "La Meck." [...] Increasingly, {{at least in the}} eyes of hostile relatives, the situation seemed scandalous. Worse, to them, he continued to take Meck's money freely even after he had received a generous pension from Tsar Alexander III. As the children's own financial situations worsened, they grew more resolved to end the arrangement between their mother and Tchaikovsky. By mid- to late 1890, over a two-month period, she had been visited by all but one of her elder children and may even have been given a final ultimatum. The final letter and payment from Meck to Tchaikovsky were delivered by a trusted servant of hers, Ivan Vasilyev, for whom he held warm feelings. She had never sent <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> this way before and had always sent letters and checks by post.|$|E

2500|$|During the secession crisis {{following}} Lincoln's election, Federal {{troops were}} {{under the command of}} Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Albert Sidney Johnston, in Benicia, headquarters of the Department of the Pacific. General Johnston strongly believed in the Southern right to secede but regretted that it was occurring. A group of Southern sympathizers in the state made plans to secede with Oregon to form a [...] "Pacific Republic". The success of their plans rested on the cooperation of General Johnston. Johnston met with some of these Southern men, but before they could propose <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> he told them that he had heard rumors of an attempt to seize the San Francisco forts and arsenal at Benicia, that he had prepared for that and would defend the facilities under his command with all his resources and to the last drop of his blood. He told them to tell this to their Southern friends. Deprived of his aid the plans for California and Oregon to secede from the United States never came to fruition.|$|E
2500|$|As of 716, Yao Yuanzhi—who {{had changed}} his name to Yao Chong by that point—and Lu Huaishen were serving as chancellors. [...] Lu died in late 716, and before he did, {{submitted}} a petition arguing that Song and several other officials, Li Jie (李傑), Li Chaoyin (李朝隱), and Lu Chongyuan had been demoted only of minor offenses and, as they were talented, should be repromoted. [...] Meanwhile, Yao was drawing displeasure from Emperor Xuanzong due to accusations that his sons and associate Zhao Hui (趙誨) were corrupt. [...] Yao, in fear, offered to resign and recommended Song to succeed him. [...] Emperor Xuanzong, who was then preparing to go to Luoyang, thus recalled Song to serve as the minister of justice (刑部尚書, Xingbu Shangshu) and be in charge of Chang'an. [...] He sent one of his close eunuch associates, Yang Sixu (楊思勗), to Guang Prefecture to escort Song back to the capital. [...] Yang had many past achievements—including putting down a coup during Emperor Zhongzong's reign led by Emperor Zhongzong's crown prince Li Chongjun—and was honored by the emperor, but on the trip back to Chang'an, Song, who did not like to ingratiate the emperor's associates, did not say <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> [...] When Yang informed Emperor Xuanzong of this, Emperor Xuanzong was even more impressed with Song. [...] Around the new year 717, he removed Yao and fellow chancellor Yuan Qianyao from their chancellor posts and replaced them with Song and Su Ting—naming Song Huangmen Jian (黃門監, the head of the examination bureau, which by that point had been renamed Huangmen Sheng (黃門省)) and acting minister of civil service affairs. [...] Emperor Xuanzong also created Song the Duke of Guangping. [...] Song and Su worked well together, with Song taking the leading role and Su the assisting role. [...] With Yao having distinguished himself as one who modified the regulations to fit the situation and Song known for following the laws strictly and fairly, it was said that while their styles were different, they were both considered great chancellors of Emperor Xuanzong's reign. [...] Song was also known for often making suggestions to correct Emperor Xuanzong's and governmental officials' behavior, thus causing Emperor Xuanzong to respect him more.
