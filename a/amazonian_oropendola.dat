50|$|Icterids are {{variable}} in size, and often display considerable sexual dimorphism, with brighter coloration and greater size in males being typical. While such dimorphism is widely known in passerines, the sexual dimorphism by size is uniquely extreme in icterids. For example, the male great-tailed grackle is 60% {{heavier than the}} female. The smallest icterid species is the orchard oriole, in which the female averages 15 cm in length (6 in) and 18 g in weight, while the largest is the <b>Amazonian</b> <b>oropendola,</b> the male of which measures 52 cm and weighs about 550 g. This variation is greater {{than in any other}} passerine family (unless the kinglet calyptura belongs with the cotingas, which would then have greater variation). One unusual morphological adaptation shared by the icterids is gaping, where the skull is configured to allow them open their bills strongly rather than passively, allowing them to force open gaps to obtain otherwise hidden food.|$|E
40|$|Redescriptions of Bizarrifrons magus (Nitzsch [in Giebel], 1866), {{the type}} species of Bizarrifrons, and B. picturatus Carriker & Diaz-Ungria, 1961 are given based on {{material}} from their type hosts. The nymphal instars {{of these two}} species are described and illustrated for the first time. Also, three new species are named and described: B. latifrons, from the russet-backed oropendola, Psarocolius angustifrons alfredi (Des Murs, 1856); B. wecksteini, from the <b>Amazonian</b> <b>oropendola,</b> Psarocolius b. bifasciatus (Spix, 1824); and B. quasisymmetricus, from the solitary cacique, Cacicus solitarius (Vieillot, 1816) (Passeriformes: Icteridae). Two species-groups are proposed, and a checklist and a key for the species of Bizarrifrons are also included. Sequences of {{a portion of the}} mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and the nuclear elongation factor 1 alpha (EF- 1 alpha) genes for two species are given {{for the first time in}} this genus.
