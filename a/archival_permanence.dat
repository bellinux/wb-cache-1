Typically, after exposure, the unhardened portion was rinsed away with warm water, leaving a thin relief that either contained a pigment included during manufacture or was subsequently stained with a dye. Some processes depended on the hardening only, {{in combination with the}} differential absorption of certain dyes by the hardened or unhardened areas. Because some of these processes allowed the use of highly stable dyes and pigments, such as carbon black, prints with an extremely high degree of <b>archival</b> <b>permanence</b> and resistance to fading from prolonged exposure to light could be produced.|$|E
25|$|Many photographers {{continue}} to produce some monochrome images, sometimes {{because of the}} established <b>archival</b> <b>permanence</b> of well-processed silver-halide-based materials. Some full-color digital images are processed {{using a variety of}} techniques to create black-and-white results, and some manufacturers produce digital cameras that exclusively shoot monochrome. Monochrome printing or electronic display can be used to salvage certain photographs taken in color which are unsatisfactory in their original form; sometimes when presented as black-and-white or single-color-toned images they are found to be more effective. Although color photography has long predominated, monochrome images are still produced, mostly for artistic reasons. Almost all digital cameras have an option to shoot in monochrome, and almost all image editing software can combine or selectively discard RGB color channels to produce a monochrome image from one shot in color.|$|E

40|$|As {{managers}} of special collections engage with evolving formats and technologies, {{it is imperative}} that these professionals remain well versed in papyrus, paper, and principles that inform <b>archival</b> work. The <b>permanence</b> of this content defines our past, informs our present, and shapes our future. However, a constricting interpretation of archival principles heavily focused on the “integrity ” of recordkeeping drives collection managers further from the resources needed to do their jobs in this new age of archiving.

50|$|The {{composition}} of the emulsion used in Ilfochrome prints is responsible for color purity, image clarity, and <b>archival</b> <b>permanence.</b> Azo dyes, which provide stable vivid colors, are embedded in the Ilfochrome emulsion and bleached out in processing. Since the dyes are in the emulsion {{rather than in the}} chemistry, the image is also much sharper and clearer because the dyes create an anti-light-scattering layer which keeps the image from being diffused when viewed. As the azo dyes are far more stable than chromogenic dyes, prints made by this process are of archival quality and galleries and art collectors report they do not fade in normal light.|$|E
50|$|If {{set up and}} {{executed}} correctly, the colours in the new positive print can resemble very closely the colours in the original print but only as they survive today. Therefore, whatever fading, decomposition and/or other changes, which may have occurred to the colours down through the years, will also be copied along with them. Unfortunately, beyond the possibility to make very slight improvements to the saturation this method offers {{little in the way}} of any colour restoration. There are, meanwhile, other notable disadvantages, not least the use of modern colour film stock. Colour film is both expensive and has questionable <b>archival</b> <b>permanence,</b> as modern colour dyes are known to fade in time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{resulting}} finished print, whether {{composed of}} several layers and in full color or having {{only a single}} monochrome layer, exhibits a very slight bas-relief effect and a variation of texture on its surface, both distinctive characteristics of a carbon print. The process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Each color carbon print requires three, or four, round trips in the darkroom to create the finished print. An individual, using existing pigmented sheets and separations, can prepare, print and process enough material, 60 sheets including the support, to produce about twelve 20" [...] x 24" [...] four-color prints in a 40-hour work week. However, this investment {{of time and effort}} can create prints of outstanding visual quality and proven <b>archival</b> <b>permanence.</b>|$|E
5000|$|René Pauli (1935-1999) was a Swiss-American artist {{known for}} his {{original}} photographs and tri-color carbon print making process. His tri-color carbon prints of original nature photographs were sold in several U.S. photography galleries, featured by an Eastman Kodak exhibition and by the Sierra Club and {{are included in the}} collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the Polk Museum of Art. [...] René revived and perfected the carbon printing process independently in a small apartment in San Francisco by engineering all hand built machines, even creating his own paper mats. His tri-color carbon prints were noted for their unmatched color, quality and detail, bas-relief effect, and <b>archival</b> <b>permanence,</b> estimated to last virtually unchanged for many hundreds of years.|$|E

50|$|From 1842 de Villeneuve took up photography, {{not long}} after its invention, as an adjunct and aid to his graphic work, {{producing}} some daguerreotypes but predominantly softly toned salted paper prints from paper negatives that enabled the retouching he employed for artistic effect. Following the method of Humbert de Molard, he fixed his prints with ammonia which avoided the bleaching of highlights caused in salt prints by hypo, and thus incidentally ensured the <b>archival</b> <b>permanence</b> of his prints, which survive today. He had many of his prints made by photolithographer Rose-Joseph Lemercier (1803-1887). In 1850 de Villeneuve opened a photographic studio at 18 Rue Bleue, Paris, where his subjects were 'academic studies', small prints of nudes as models for artists. He printed a series of these studies as ‘Etudes d’apres nature’, and many were published in La Lumiere, journal of the Society Francaise de la Photographie. There was also a ready market for his photographs of well-known actors in full costume posing against theatrical scenery.|$|E
