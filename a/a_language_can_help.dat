This study compared 12 adults adopted from Korea to the US as young children (all but one prior to age one year) to 13 participants who had no prior exposure to Korean to examine whether relearning can aid in accessing early childhood language memory. All 25 participants were recruited and tested during {{the second week of}} first-semester college Korean language classes. They completed a language background questionnaire and interview, a childhood slang task and a Korean phoneme identification task. Results revealed an advantage for adoptee participants in identifying some Korean phonemes, suggesting that some components of early childhood language memory can remain intact despite many years of disuse, and that relearning <b>a</b> <b>language</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> in accessing such a memory.

40|$|Most Finnish {{university}} students, {{just like}} the other new global elites (Kramsch, 2013), use English without problems. Some students, however, struggle with English {{to the extent that}} their studies suffer. One could say that they have a deeply “wounded” English self (Karlsson, 2013). My context of research and practice is the Autonomous Learning Modules (ALMS) at Helsinki University Language Centre. In my work as <b>a</b> <b>language</b> counsellor and practitioner-researcher, pedagogical concerns are always primary, and {{there is a need to}} appreciate diversity yet notice every student’s unique experiences.

30|$|Third, another {{question}} can be asked: does {{the modernization of}} minority groups suggest {{a greater degree of}} Han-icization? If this is the case, does the common prosperity of all of the ethnic groups point towards greater convergence, but also undermine the diversity within the unified multi-ethnic structure? This is of course an existing possibility, but what I thinkis: the wealthier a society becomes, the greater chance that members of that society develop a common personality. On the other hand, the more poverty a society has, the less its members have choices about how to live. If this law can similarly be used in the realm of ethnicities, the greater modernization and more developed the economy, the greater the opportunity for all of the ethnicities to share their respective advantageous ethnic characteristics. During the process of industrialization, there will be inevitably more commonalities between the ways of life of different ethnic groups. For example, in order to exchange information, you need a shared language; however, this certainly does not obstruct each ethnic group from using their own spoken and written <b>languages</b> to develop <b>a</b> characteristic literature. <b>A</b> common <b>language</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> different ethnic groups learn from and influence one another, as well as promote their own literary development. Other examples include the adaptations that different ethnic groups have made to their ecological conditions. Tibetans can live and work at very high altitudes. They can utilize this feature as a driving force in the development of their region, as well as help to improve the economic viability of peoples in other regions through cross-group interchange. I am reminded of these circumstances, and I believe that as long as we address this problem as soon as possible, we have a way to meet this challenge. During the process of modernization, through the spirit of unity and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups, we can achieve the purpose of common prosperity, and continue to develop a higher level of unified multi-ethnic integration. To use a metaphor, at this level, the Chinese nation will be like a large, beautiful garden made up of one hundred different kinds of flowers. I find this prospect encouraging and this is where I end this essay.|$|R

The effect of two instructional support instruments, a video-based model and a script, on the development of collaborative writing processes is described. Using a mixed-methods approach, collaboration intensity and efficiency are measured quantitatively, and collaboration effectiveness is observed qualitatively. The data originate from an in-class intervention study: 42 university college students grouped in triads wrote three syntheses in subsequent sessions, collaborating in Google Docs, and being supported in two of the sessions. The analysis results confirm the benefit of the support instruments used and broaden the understanding of collaborative writing processes: qualitative insight shows that joint information processing is intensified through scaffolding, and leads to a better content selection and to good peer-induced revisions of the jointly produced text on different levels. Regarding collaboration efficiency, work flow was improved through scaffolding, albeit to a less noticeable degree for the high-proficiency group...|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, we {{are going}} to {{consider}} how language and practice interact in the process of supporting the learning of students with diverse abilities. You will learn that it is necessary for teachers to understand that while labels carry an administrative function in schools, when used carelessly they operate to stigmatise and exclude those whom we are working to include. This chapter will introduce the concept of equity and explain how the dilemma of difference emerges when we try to determine who should receive support and how. The chapter will also explain how <b>an</b> appreciation of <b>language</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> to inform and transform our pedagogy. An example of inclusion in action is provided to illustrate how inclusive <b>language</b> in practice <b>can</b> promote deep cultural changes that benefit both students and teachers. The process of determining appropriate and effective education of students with additional support requirements is troubled by what some refer to as the ‘dilemma of difference’. This dilemma derives mainly from the nature of language and our need to use certain words, terms and categories in order to share common understandings. Without these, educators cannot hope to arrive on the same page, yet such words can take on a life of their own; influencing thoughts, perspectives and attitudes in ways that far outstrip original intentions. The drive for clarity, however, through definition and diagnostic classification can ultimately obscure because of the cultural meanings that become invested within these terms through their use over time and in different professional contexts. In effect, trying to define “difference” in order to provide the right support to particular students is a process that entrenches normative boundaries that in turn create, accentuate and stigmatise whatever we have decided constitutes difference. <b>Language</b> is thus <b>a</b> powerful and dangerous weapon but, like other weapons, <b>language</b> <b>can</b> both hurt and defend. Understanding the power of language enables educators to use it both wisely and safely to the maximum benefit of their students. This chapter will discuss how teachers can recognise and support their students in ways that avoid stigma and the closure of stereotyping...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims to {{find the}} best design for use on a package label, by incorporating both languages and characteristics, to maximize perception of the product’s value by consumers from different countries. 　In this study, we examine the effect of language on packaging design. We explore how the presentation of different <b>languages</b> on <b>a</b> label <b>can</b> affect the consumers’ perception of the product’s value in various countries and how likely they would feel toward the product. The results of this study will determine which language affords the highest perception of value and the most neutral impression. These two elements, when combined, can yield the most effective label design for a given country. By modifying the language used on the package, designers can reduce the cost of packaging design; moreover, such modification is likely to be more effective than changing design aspects such as the material, shape, color, and imagery. In addition to reducing cost, modifying the language significantly impacts consumers’ impressions of a product, which in turn influences their decision to purchase. 　Knowing which languages should or should not appear on a marketing label in different countries allows packaging designers to influence a consumer’s decision to purchase significantly and inexpensively. Moreover, this enables packaging designers to choose the appropriate language or combination of languages to sell in target regions. For manufacturers, using the most effective languages on labels will help attract consumers by achieving a higher perceived value than that of other products in the same category. 　In this study, 315 potential consumers were sampled: 105 participants each from Taiwan, Japan, and Thailand. Subjects were presented with seven different packaging labels over a fixed amount of time. Label designs were presented in five different languages, and one sample remained unlabeled. The five languages were English, Thai, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and Korean; these languages are the most commonly used languages on packaging labels in all three target countries. After viewing the labels, the subjects were asked to estimate a suitable price for each sample product. They were also asked to rate their impression of the product on a scale from 1 to 5, based on the use of language on the label. An analysis of the data showed that the consumers’ trends {{in each of the three}} countries were different, in terms of both their product value perception and impression of a product based on the language presented on the labels. 　The results of this study are as follows: (<b>a)</b> Using different <b>languages</b> on packaging labels significantly impacts consumer perception of product value. Because consumers of different nationalities associate different value to language on packaging labels, <b>language</b> selection <b>can</b> significantly affect the product’s perceived value. (b) English is the most influential language in label design. English is seen as appealing and affords a higher product value perception. (c) Incorporating English into a packaging label, even as <b>a</b> secondary <b>language,</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> increase the product’s quality perception. The results of this study provides useful information for product manufacturers and packaging designers to create the best concept in packaging design for attracting more consumers at the point of sale. 　This thesis is organized as follows: Chapter 1 details the study background, in addition to our research objectives, motivation, research idea, and technical terms. Chapter 2 provides an overview of existing literature on the impact of packaging design on product value perception and briefly discusses related research. Chapter 3 briefly describes the research method, including the selection process for participants from the three different countries, label designs used in the research samples, sample display and questionnaire preparation, and data collection. Chapter 4 presents the results of data analysis and the basic information derived from the analysis of variables through descriptive statistics. The first section of Chapter 4 describes the result of value perception based on different languages on packaging labels using ANOVA. The second section describes the result of the perception of packaging design characteristics based on different <b>languages</b> using <b>a</b> stepwise multiple regression analysis. Finally, Chapter 5 presents our research conclusions and presents possibilities for future research. 工学甲第 258...|$|R

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>language</b> {{guide that}} ensures that {{information}} sourced from the operational level is precise, consistent and unambiguous. Summary The civil-military-police community is {{as diverse as}} it is broad. It contains {{a wide range of}} actors who employ varying methodologies, use a variety of techniques, utilise unique equipment and often pursue different objectives in service of different masters. Diversity is a strength of the civil-military-police domain, although a common understanding is required between community members to realise that strength. The range of different terminology employed across the civil-military-police community can make it difficult to form a common understanding. Strategic level decision making should be driven by shared information and understandings. <b>A</b> Civil-Military-Police <b>Language</b> Guide <b>can</b> <b>help</b> ensure that information sourced from the operational level is precise, consistent and unambiguous. The demand for these qualities increases during crises. This Civil-Military-Police Language Guide is not intended to force participants to conform to any single set of terms; different sectors within the civil-military-police community may use different terminology. However, recognising and respecting the differences between actors is vital. The terminology employed by each actor can hold vastly different meanings, with implications for planning, preparedness and investment in activities such as training. The terms included in the Language Guide are applicable to, or commonly used in the civil-military-police field; and meet one of the following tests: 1. Are subject to contested or inconsistent interpretation; or 2. Are used by a limited number of actors in the civil-military-police field, and thus unfamiliar to some. Many terms listed in the Language Guide include multiple definitions – beginning with that of the most likely ‘lead agency’ for that term. For instance, ‘humanitarian assistance’ first lists the definition according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The Guide then provides definitions from other sources; such as academic, military or government. Just as important as the definitions of terms is the ‘commentary’ alongside each term. This commentary provides context and demonstrates where there is potential for misunderstanding and any impacts on planning. The commentary will provide guidance on: • How the reader should discern between a choice of potential terms for use; and • How the reader can distinguish an author’s intended meaning. This guidance is equally applicable to the ‘spoken word’. This first edition of the Language Guide has been developed in collaboration with departments, agencies and the non-government sector, in Australia and overseas. It is intended for use across the civil-military-police community, and particularly for those who are new to the sector. The Language Guide will be most valuable when used in conjunction with the joint ACFID-ACMC publication Same Space – Different Mandates, or the revised version Same Space – Different Mandates International, which provides greater detail on the differences between actors in a conflict and disaster management setting. <b>Language</b> is <b>an</b> ever-evolving concept and this edition of the Language Guide should be viewed as a starting point.
