5|$|Hans Rønning's {{assignment}} to officiate {{the game was}} viewed by other on-ice officials as <b>a</b> <b>nod</b> to organizers from Lillehammer, Norway, who had just {{won the right to}} host the 1994 Winter Olympics and were observing the game. At age 38, Rønning expected the 1987 tournament to be among his last international assignments. Rønning never officiated another international game, though he did referee two more seasons in Norway before retiring.|$|E

5|$|Researchers at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History gave {{a species}} of praying mantis the name Ilomantis ginsburgae after Ginsburg. The name was given because the neck plate of the Ilomantis ginsburgae bears a {{resemblance}} to a jabot, which Ginsburg is known for wearing. Moreover, the new species was identified based upon the female insect's genitalia instead of based upon the male of the species. The researchers noted that the name was <b>a</b> <b>nod</b> to Ginsburg's fight for gender equality.|$|E

5|$|The Chrysler Building is {{considered}} a leading example of Art Deco architecture. The exterior of the building has about fifty total ornaments protruding from the building's corners at five different floors in a way similar to the gargoyles of Gothic cathedrals.

5|$|The {{freeway and}} {{expressway}} sections of M-53 are officially {{known as the}} Christopher Columbus Freeway as <b>a</b> <b>nod</b> to Macomb County's large Italian American population. This designation {{was approved by the}} Michigan Legislature in 1978. The remainder has been named Van Dyke Avenue or Van Dyke Road. That name honors James A. Van Dyke, a prominent attorney in Detroit in the 19th century. Van Dyke was the prosecutor for Wayne County, as well as both city attorney and mayor of Detroit. The street through Detroit was named in his honor, and as the highway was extended northward, the name was carried with it.|$|E
5|$|Tropic Thunder was {{released}} in the United States on DVD and Blu-ray on November 18, 2008, three months after its release and {{a week after the}} end of its theatrical run in the U.S. and Canada.

Special features include an unrated director's cut of the film, audio commentaries (including one featuring Stiller, Downey, and Black, with Downey providing his commentary as Lincoln Osiris, <b>a</b> <b>nod</b> to a joke in the film that Lazarus never breaks character until he completes the DVD commentary), several featurettes, deleted scenes, an alternate ending, and the Rain of Madness mockumentary.|$|E

60|$|In the {{meantime}} {{the girl had}} gone straight home, light as a bird, tremulous with joy, to the little cottage where she lived alone with a maiden aunt; and to that lady, a grim, sixty years old Scotchwoman, with <b>a</b> <b>nodding</b> head, communicated news of her encounter and invitation.|$|R
5|$|A remastered and {{extended}} {{cut of the}} film, named the Signature Edition, was shown in one-off screenings across the United States and Canada on September 30, 2015, and October 4, 2015. The edition is approximately two minutes longer than the original cut, and features a brief scene with Annie and Dean and the sequence of the Giant's dream. Both scenes were storyboarded by Bird during the production on the original film but never finished due to time and budget constraints. Before they were fully completed for this new version, they were available as deleted storyboards on the 2004 DVD bonus features. They were animated in 2015 by Duncan Studio, which employed several animators that worked on the original film. The film's Signature Edition was released on DVD and for digital download on February 16, 2016. An official Blu-ray release was available on September 6, 2016. Along with the additional scene, it also showcases abandoned ideas that were not initially used due to copyright reasons, specifically <b>a</b> <b>nod</b> to Disney via a Tomorrowland commercial, which was also a reference to his then-recently released film of the same name, and a joke regarding the film being shot with CinemaScope cameras.|$|E
5|$|Command & Conquer {{features}} two sub-plots {{based on}} the two playable factions of the game. Commanding the Global Defense Initiative's troops, the player becomes instrumental in eliminating Nod's European forces. Under the command of General Mark Jamison Sheppard, the player completes missions that range from securing a beach, to rescuing civilians and scientists, to defending GDI bases from Nod assaults. Combat occurs in countries of Central and Eastern Europe. A major plot element is an international scandal caused by <b>a</b> <b>Nod</b> media manipulation, which convinces {{the world that the}} GDI deliberately attacked and massacred the Polish city of Białystok. This leads to a cut in GDI funding, forcing the player to play several missions with limited forces. Finally, the player besieges the Temple of Nod in Sarajevo, Bosnia, which Kane uses as his main base of operations.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Cooper {{received}} two nominations {{for his role}} as Rocket in the superhero film Guardians of the Galaxy. Later that year, he starred in and co-produced the biographical war film American Sniper. Cooper was nominated for an Academy Award and MTV Movie Award for Best Actor, and an Academy Award for Best Picture. With these nominations, Cooper became only the tenth actor in history to receive an Academy Award nomination in three consecutive years. Although Cooper's roles in the 2015 films Aloha and Joy earned him two additional nominations, his performance as the severely deformed Joseph Merrick in the Broadway revival The Elephant Man garnered more recognition. His performance in The Elephant Man landed him four nominations, including <b>a</b> <b>nod</b> for a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.|$|E

5|$|Love Kraft is {{the seventh}} studio album by Welsh indie rock band Super Furry Animals, {{released}} on 22 August 2005 through Epic Records in the United Kingdom. The album {{was recorded in}} Spain with producer Mario Caldato Jr and {{was something of a}} departure for the band, with all members contributing songs and lead vocals alongside Gruff Rhys who had been main songwriter for the Super Furries until this point. In selecting tracks for Love Kraft a conscious effort was made by the band not to choose songs on their individual merit but rather to pick those which went well together in order to create as cohesive an album as possible. The album's name was taken from a sex shop, Love Craft, near the Cardiff offices of the Super Furries' management team and is also <b>a</b> <b>nod</b> to American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft.|$|E
5|$|A {{turning point}} of the game came on the first {{possession}} of the second half. The Giants received the second half kickoff, and led a short drive that stalled at their own 47-yard line. On fourth and 1, the Giants lined up in a punt formation before shifting to a traditional set. Second string quarterback Jeff Rutledge then looked over to Parcells for a signal {{as to whether he}} should try to draw the defense offside or run a play. After <b>a</b> <b>nod</b> of approval from Parcells, he ran a quarterback sneak for a first down. The Giants scored on the drive, and built a 39–13 lead before a late touchdown by the Broncos made the final score 39–20. Simms threw touchdown passes to Mark Bavaro and Phil McConkey to give him three on the game, and Joe Morris and Ottis Anderson each rushed for one touchdown. The Giants' defense limited the Broncos to only two net yards and 10 offensive plays in the third quarter. The 30 second half points set a Super Bowl-record for points in a half, and Simms was named MVP after completing 22 of 25 (88%) of his passes—a Super Bowl record which still stands.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. One advertisement claimed, likely in error, that this film {{was based on the}} play The Man of the Hour. Written by George Broadhurst, the play focused on political corruption in the form of graft, but the play itself was apparently inspired by politicians of New York. The plot of the film includes <b>a</b> <b>nod</b> to the Women's suffrage movement, {{but it would be a}} decade before the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited any United States citizen from being denied the right to vote on the basis of sex. The character, Congressman Casey, would later be seen again in Orator, Knight and Cow Charmer. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. There are no known credits for the cast, but Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane are two possible actors that were prominent players in 1910. Credits may have included Anna Rosemond, one of two leading ladies of the Thanhouser company in this era. Frank H. Crane was a leading male actor of the company and also involved since the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company. Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions. A surviving film still leaves open the possibility of identifying two characters.|$|E
