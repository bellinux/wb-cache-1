After the confrontation, Billy relinquishes his gun, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> other man {{physically}} morphs and reveals himself to be the Alien Bounty Hunter. At that point, Mulder and Scully pull up and walk into the house, unable to locate Billy or his father.|$|E
5|$|Between October and January, and peaking in November, {{the species}} {{normally}} lays two smooth, white eggs, though sometimes it lays three or four.

5|$|Since the {{remainders}} decrease {{with every}} step but can never be negative, a remainder r'N must eventually equal zero, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> algorithm stops. The final nonzero remainder r'N−1 is the greatest common divisor of a and b. The number N cannot be infinite because {{there are only a}} finite number of nonnegative integers between the initial remainder r0 and zero.|$|E
5|$|The Glamorgan sausage is a Welsh {{vegetarian}} sausage. It {{contains no}} meat or skin, instead {{it is made}} with cheese, generally Caerphilly, but sometimes cheddar, along with leek or spring onion. This mixture is then coated in breadcrumbs and rolled into a sausage shape before cooking. Glamorgan sausages date back to at least the early 19th century, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> sausages would have contained pork fat.|$|E
5|$|A {{comic strip}} {{featuring}} {{the characters of}} Lady Penelope and Parker debuted in the early issues of APF Publishing's children's title TV Century 21 in 1965. A full-length Thunderbirds strip appeared a year later, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> Lady Penelope adventures were given their own comic. Thunderbirds, Lady Penelope and Captain Scarlet and Thunderbirds annuals {{were published in the}} late 1960s; during the same period, eight original novels were written.

40|$|Summary. In this {{document}} we address some complications regarding the weighted edge-searching problem. This variant of edge-searching extends the original problem by considering situations where multiple searchers {{may be required}} to clear a single edge or guard a single vertex. We show that previous work on this topic overlooked a fundamental problem that arises from the addition of weights. As a consequence, a previously developed algorithm that was thought to compute optimal solutions on trees is in fact not optimal. We describe <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>points</b> <b>the</b> proofs are incorrect, provide a counterexample, and point out how to address the problem. ...|$|R

5|$|Across {{the county}} {{line in the}} town of Caton, NY225 {{continues}} west through the gully for another , slowly rising in elevation as it heads past a small number of isolated homes. The creek reaches its source near NY225's junction with the southern terminus of CR34 (Whiskey Creek Road), <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> route ascends out of the valley and heads southwest across lightly developed, relatively level terrain to the small hamlet of Caton. In the center of the community, NY225 intersects CR32 (Caton–Seeley Creek Road) and CR120 (Tannery Creek Road). NY225 turns northwest at this intersection, becoming Caton Road as it follows Caton Creek out of the hamlet.|$|E
5|$|After {{nearly two}} weeks of inactivity, an area of {{disturbed}} weather developed in the Bay of Campeche and quickly became better organized. It was designated Tropical Depression Two {{on the evening of}} June 28, and, two hours later, data from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicated that it had strengthened into a tropical storm, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> system was named Bret. This {{was the first time that}} two tropical storms had formed in June since the 1986 season, and only the thirteenth time since 1851.|$|E
5|$|Around noon, General Henry Abbot {{arrived at}} President Street with a {{battalion}} of 99 to 114 engineers. As the group advanced toward the armory of the 6th Regiment where {{they were to be}} quartered, they were met by a crowd of 500. Jeers from the crowd turned to missiles until one soldier, Private Corcoran, was struck in the head and wounded. Abbot gave orders that his men were to halt and fix bayonets, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> crowd scattered.|$|E

5|$|Capelyn {{sold the}} manor to William Conway in 1600, who {{sold it to}} Edmund Clerke in 1612; Clerke's son {{inherited}} the manor in 1634 but only survived for a further two years, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> manor passed to Edmund Clerke's 8½-year-old grandson, another Edmund. This Edmund Clerke was the Sheriff of Hampshire and clerk to the Signet in 1671. Clerke the younger married the daughter of Giles Frampton, who {{took control of the}} manor after Clerke's death and sold it to Edmund Dummer, a former Surveyor of the Navy, in 1705.|$|E
5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-1960s, the Supremes {{achieved}} mainstream {{success with}} Ross as lead singer and Holland-Dozier-Holland as its songwriting and production team. In 1967, Motown president Berry Gordy renamed the group Diana Ross & the Supremes, and replaced Ballard with Cindy Birdsong. Ross left {{to pursue a}} solo career in 1970 {{and was replaced by}} Jean Terrell, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> group's name reverted to The Supremes. After 1972, the lineup changed more frequently; Lynda Laurence, Scherrie Payne, and Susaye Greene all became members of the group during the mid-1970s. The Supremes disbanded in 1977 after 18 years.|$|E

50|$|The piano part has {{sometimes}} been called skeletal, and though technically demanding, it has been considered to lack Tchaikovsky's characteristic boldness when compared with his other piano concertos. David Brown suggests this lack of boldness {{was due to the}} solo part being incorporated without any attempt to rewrite the musical material originally intended for the Symphony in E-flat. Others have argued that the pianistic texture is often congenial to the keyboard and that the adaption on the whole is well done. They suggest {{that it is difficult to}} imagine <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>points</b> <b>the</b> piano part takes over material previously intended as part of the orchestral fabric and <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the soloist merely embroiders upon it.|$|R
30|$|Calmfors (1994) also {{discusses}} <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>point</b> in <b>the</b> unemployment spell {{workers should}} be targeted, since a later targeting reduces deadweight and locking-in effects, {{while at the}} same time this implies stronger skill attrition and more discouragement on part of the workers due to longer unemployment duration.|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Doria was {{an unusual}} and erratic {{hurricane}} that existed during September 1967. The fourth named storm and hurricane of the 1967 Atlantic hurricane season, Doria developed on September 8 off {{the east coast of}} Florida. It meandered until attaining tropical storm status, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> storm accelerated towards the northeast. On September 10, Doria intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. After moving out to sea, the storm turned westward towards the United States. A compact cyclone, Doria weakened to a tropical storm shortly before moving ashore in the Mid-Atlantic States. The storm ultimately dissipated on September 21.|$|E

5|$|In {{the life}} cycle of Plasmodium, a female Anopheles {{mosquito}} (the definitive host) transmits a motile infective form (called the sporozoite) to a vertebrate host such as a human (the secondary host), thus acting as a transmission vector. A sporozoite travels through the blood vessels to liver cells (hepatocytes), where it reproduces asexually (tissue schizogony), producing thousands of merozoites. These infect new red blood cells and initiate a series of asexual multiplication cycles (blood schizogony) that produce 8 to 24 new infective merozoites, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> cells burst and the infective cycle begins anew.|$|E
5|$|Kate is {{revealed}} to be the marshal's prisoner, wearing the handcuffs that Walt found in the jungle. As the turbulence hits, the marshal is knocked unconscious by a falling suitcase. Kate struggles to put on her oxygen mask due to the handcuffs, so she uncuffs herself using the marshal's keys and puts the marshal's oxygen mask on him before attaching her own, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> {{tail end of the}} plane suddenly breaks off and flies away.|$|E
5|$|NY376 follows Raymond Avenue {{for about}} a mile (1.6km) to the hamlet of Arlington. Here, it meets US44 and NY55, both of which follow a one-way couplet along Haight Street (eastbound) and Maple Street (westbound) through the city of Poughkeepsie. In between the two streets, NY376 intersects Main Street (CR114). The route ends upon {{intersecting}} westbound US44 and NY55, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> routing of NY376 becomes an unnumbered town road named Van Wagner Road.|$|E

The Avro 504 was piloted by Raynham with Avro co-founder Humphrey Verdon Roe (brother of A. V. Roe) as passenger. The Blackburn Type I was piloted by Harold Blackburn (no relation of aircraft designer Robert Blackburn) with the machine's owner, Dr. M. G. Christie, as passenger. The 100-mile course began and ended at Moortown, near Leeds, with control stations at York, Doncaster, Sheffield and Barnsley, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>points</b> <b>the</b> competitors were required to land for 20 minutes.
