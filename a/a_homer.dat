25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on May 24 {{for a series}} against the St. Louis Cardinals amid media speculation that Manager Don Mattingly {{was in danger of}} losing his job. The team didn't help his cause as they managed only 3 hits against Lance Lynn and lost 7-0. Adrian Gonzalez had <b>a</b> <b>homer,</b> double and three RBI in a 5-3 victory over the Cardinals the following day. Gonzalez homered and drove in 3 more the next day, but Kershaw had a rough outing allowing four runs, his most all season, in a 5-3 loss. Continuing his hot streak, Gonzalez was 4 for 4 on May 27 against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim as the Dodgers came back from a 6-1 deficit to win 8-7.

25|$|In {{the first}} of a four-game road series against the Marlins on September 22, the Braves put up six runs, {{including}} two homers from Kemp totaling three runs, in a 6-3 victory over the Marlins. In the second game of the series, the Braves rallied back from a two-run deficit to score three unanswered runs and beat the Marlins 3-2. In the third inning, Kemp was ejected, and so was manager Snitker, for arguing with the home plate umpire over a 3-1 pitch call. Despite Freeman's adding to his 28-game hit streak with two hits and <b>a</b> <b>homer,</b> the Braves couldn't overcome Blair surrendering six hits, five runs and three walks in 3 1/3 innings pitched, and fell 6-4 {{for only the second time}} at Marlins Park in 2016 in the third game of the series. The final game of the series was cancelled following the news that Marlins pitcher José Fernández died in a boating accident earlier that morning. The game was never made up as the season was nearly ending and both teams were out of playoff contention.|$|E
25|$|Back at Dodger Stadium, rookie Joey Gallo hit {{a two-run}} homer and the Rangers jumped on Kershaw early {{and went on to}} win 5–3. Pinch runner Kike Hernández scored on a balk by Keone Kela {{in the bottom of the}} ninth as the Dodgers snapped their three-game losing streak with a 1–0 win over the Rangers. Justin Turner had three hits in three at-bats with <b>a</b> <b>homer</b> against the Giants on June 19, but a grand slam by Buster Posey set the Giants up for a 9–5 win. In the next game, the Dodgers got {{back-to-back}} first-inning home runs from Joc Pederson and Justin Turner, but it wasn't enough as the Giants won 6–2. The Dodgers finally broke open the offense on June 21, as Yasmani Grandal hit two homers, Gonzalez and Turner also homered, and the team won 10–2. It was the third straight game Turner homered, the longest streak of his career, and Grandal became the first Dodgers catcher with two home runs and a bunt single in one game since Roy Campanella on August 30, 1955.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers {{traveled}} to Chase Field {{to play the}} Diamondbacks on April 11.

The Giants also won the next game, 2–1, despite an effective start by Paul Maholm, who allowed only one run in six innings. Ryu pitched seven scoreless innings in the series finale as the Dodgers won 2–1, {{he became the first}} Dodger pitcher since Orel Hershiser in 1988 to pitch four consecutive scoreless road starts.|$|E
25|$|Back home, the Dodgers {{lost to the}} Cardinals 7–1 as Michael Wacha {{shut down}} their offense. Two runs {{in the eighth inning}} led to a 2–1 loss the next night. Kershaw allowed only one hit in eight innings while {{striking}} out 11 on June 6 as the Dodgers came up with a 2–0 win to end their brief skid. Zack Greinke pitched 6 innings and only allowed one run while striking out eight in the series finale, however the bullpen again coughed up the lead in the eighth inning and the Dodgers lost 4–2. This was the first home series loss by the Dodgers since August 2014, the longest such span in the Majors during that time. Andre Ethier and Jimmy Rollins each hit three-run home runs to back strong pitching by Mike Bolsinger as the Dodgers routed the Diamondbacks 9–3 in the next game. Howie Kendrick homered and drove in all three runs in the Dodgers 3–1 win over the Diamondbacks on June 9. The Dodgers wrapped up the homestand with a 7–6 win over the Diamondbacks. Yasiel Puig was 4-for-4 with <b>a</b> <b>homer</b> and a walk as the Dodgers won on a walk-off RBI single by Kendrick.|$|E
25|$|In the 2003 American League Division Series, the Red Sox rallied from a 0–2 series deficit {{against the}} Oakland Athletics {{to win the}} best-of-five series. In extra innings of game three at Fenway pinch hitter Trot Nixion belted <b>a</b> <b>homer</b> into the center field bleachers to give the Sox victory. Derek Lowe, who had become a starter after several years as a relief pitcher, {{returned}} to his former role to save Game 5, a 4–3 victory, by striking out the A's Terrence Long with the tying run on third base. The team then faced the New York Yankees in the 2003 American League Championship Series. In the deciding seventh game Boston took a 4–0 lead on home runs by Nixon and Kevin Millar. But two Giambi homers made it 4–2. Boston led 5–2 thanks to a shot by David Ortiz in the eighth inning, but Pedro Martínez, who was still pitching into the 8th inning, allowed three runs to tie the game, including a two-run bloop double by Jorge Posada. The Red Sox could not score off Mariano Rivera {{over the last three}} innings and eventually lost the game 6–5 when Yankee third baseman Aaron Boone hit a solo home run off Red Sox pitcher Tim Wakefield.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} game of a three-game series in the nation's capital, a fielder's choice RBI by Peterson and a two-run rally in the ninth wasn't enough to {{overcome}} a five-run deficit – a two-run homer by Trea Turner and a three-run homer by Chris Heisey, both in the third inning – and the Braves's six-game win streak was snapped with a 6-4 loss to the Nationals. After Perez gave up a 4-1 lead in the third inning of the second game of the series, which included a Rendon grand slam and <b>a</b> <b>homer</b> from Ryan Zimmerman, the Braves rallied back with RBI's from Dansby Swanson and Joel De La Cruz to tie the game at 6-6. However, the Nationals responded with a three-run eighth inning, which included Michael Taylor scoring on a Flowers throwing error, and a Swanson single RBI in the ninth wasn't enough to prevent a 9-7 loss. In the final game of the series, Chris Withrow blew a two-run lead in the seventh inning and the game eventually went into extra innings. A Peterson RBI single in the 10th put the Braves up a run in the 10th, but Rendon responded with an RBI single to tie the game again. A walk-off single by Wilson Ramos in the 11th secured a 5-4 victory for the Nationals.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on April 18 for another {{series with the}} Diamondbacks. They lost {{the first game of}} the series 4–2 in 12 innings.

Puig tripled and Hanley Ramírez hit <b>a</b> <b>homer</b> and double to pace the offense in the 5–2 win over the Phillies.

Kemp and Gonzalez both homered in the Dodgers 6–3 the next day. Ryu was pounded in the final game of the homestand and the Dodgers lost to the Rockies 6–1.|$|E
25|$|The season {{started with}} a Billy Rohr one-hitter at Yankee Stadium. In Detroit, Yastrzemski hit a game tying {{home run in the}} ninth, then Dalton Jones won it with <b>a</b> <b>homer</b> in the {{following}} inning. 1967 also saw the renewal of a rivalry with the Yankees. In a series at the Bronx, Boston third baseman Joe Foy hit a grand slam in the opener then the following night hit another homer. The Yankee pitching took revenge and started throwing the ball at Red Sox hitters. At Fenway one night against the Angels, rookie Reggie Smith hit 3 home runs in one night (which included hit {{from both sides of the}} plate). Newly acquired 2nd baseman Jerry Adair won it in extra innings with a home run into the Green Monster net in LF. The Red Sox won the final games against the Minnesota Twins at Fenway Park. In the first game 1B George Scott broke the tie with a home run to center field. Then Carl Yastrzemski won the AL home run contest by hitting his 44th into the bullpen.

Twins pinch hitter Rich Collins popped to Rico Petrocelli to give the Red Sox their first pennant since 1946.|$|E
