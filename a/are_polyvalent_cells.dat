40|$|Background: Ideally, bacteriophages of {{pathogenic}} bacterial hosts should <b>be</b> <b>polyvalent</b> to <b>be</b> able {{to replicate}} in an alternative nonpathogenic bacterium. Thus, accidental infection {{by the original}} host can be avoided when bacteriophage lysates are used in biocontrol protocols. Results: From 15 wastewater samples, collected at different sites in the V Region in Chile, we selected three bacteriophages (FC, FP, and FQ) capable of productively infecting Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis. By transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation, the bacteriophages were found {{to belong to the}} order Caudoviridae. Molecular analyses indicated that FC, FP, and FQ contained double-stranded DNA genomes, of sizes similar to bacteriophage P 22, and distinct recognition sites for the restriction endonucleases HaeIII and HindIII. Assays of host range revealed that the bacteriophages <b>were</b> <b>polyvalent</b> and thus capable of infecting different strains of Escherichia coli and other serovars of Salmonella. Conclusion: We have isolated new bacteriophages of the serovar Choleraesuis with various potential applications in relation to this pathogenic bacterium...|$|R

Clearance of viable Pseudomonas from lung tissue was significantly better in vaccinees than controls at both 3 h (P less than 0. 02) and 6 h (P less than 0. 05) after infection.

The genome has a modular arrangement, as reported for those of most Siphoviridae phages, but appears to encode only structural proteins and carry a single lysis gene. All genes are transcribed in the same direction. RRH 1 has the smallest genome yet of any described functional Siphoviridae phage.
