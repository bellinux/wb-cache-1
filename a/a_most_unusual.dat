5|$|Another large {{building}} lies crosswise at {{the south}} end of the east range. Its lower level consists of a vaulted hall equipped with a grand thirteenth century hooded fireplace and its own garderobe. It is not clear what this chamber was used for, but it may have been the monastic infirmary—if so, it was <b>a</b> <b>most</b> <b>unusual,</b> perhaps unique, arrangement. Normally in a medieval Cistercian monastery an infirmary with its own kitchens, chapel and ancillary buildings would have been located east of the main buildings around a second, smaller cloister, but at Netley these seem to be absent. So far, excavations have not revealed whether Netley had a separate infirmary complex.|$|E
5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon this man has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing it like a gentleman. In many ways <b>a</b> <b>most</b> <b>unusual</b> trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one rises—he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench {{to come down and}} perch on the step of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners' seats... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes some human understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E
25|$|The {{contractor}} of {{the building}} is Bong Sin, with the consulting engineer as Steen Sehested and Coltman as the architect. The structure bears {{more than a passing}} resemblance to Frank Lloyd Wright's Imperial Hotel, Tokyo, in its details and overall layout. If this was explicit on the part of Coltman, it would be <b>a</b> <b>most</b> <b>unusual</b> apparition of Prairie Style in South East Asia, and an indication of the architect's ability to work within many stylistic parameters, a flexibility he exhibited throughout his long and distinguished career. Coltman is known for his role in establishing one of the largest firms in the area, and for his part in bringing modernism to the Federated States of Malaya, later Malaysia.|$|E

He met her magnificently.|$|R
25|$|The {{discovery}} of the W and Z bosons themselves {{had to wait for}} the construction of a particle accelerator powerful enough to produce them. The first such machine that became available was the Super Proton Synchrotron, where unambiguous signals of W bosons were seen in January 1983 during a series of experiments made possible by Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer. The actual experiments were called UA1 (led by Rubbia) and UA2 (led by Pierre Darriulat), and were the collaborative effort of many people. Van der Meer was the driving force on the accelerator end (stochastic cooling). UA1 and UA2 found the Z boson a few months later, in May 1983. Rubbia and van der Meer were promptly awarded the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physics, <b>a</b> <b>most</b> <b>unusual</b> step for the conservative Nobel Foundation.|$|E
25|$|He was <b>a</b> <b>most</b> <b>unusual</b> wicket-keeper - {{along with}} Clyde Walcott {{probably}} the tallest to regularly play this position - and his clumsy build suggested a {{complete lack of}} style behind the stumps. His debut behind the stumps came {{in one of the}} most remarkable county matches of all time. When Northamptonshire played Surrey at Northampton in 1920 the match produced 1,475 runs (a championship record which stood for nearly seventy years), including a century in around 35 minutes by Percy Fender. Bellamy's first victim was Jack Hobbs, and he conceded only 11 byes as Surrey totalled 619-5 declared and 120-2. Initially he was not regarded as a serious batsman, but as early as 1922 Bellamy scored his career best batting total of 168 against an admittedly weak Worcestershire bowling attack. Three years later, after Northamptonshire lost eight wickets for 216 he put on 93 with Phillip Wright for the ninth wicket and with fellow Wollaston boy Vernon Murdin 148 runs for the last wicket against Glamorgan, which is still a county record. Bellamy reached his peak in 1928, when he scored 1,116 runs with two centuries, but injury and age gradually began to catch up with him in the 1930s. He missed the last eighteen games of 1931 and never reached the same records he had in the previous decade during his last four seasons with the side.|$|E
500|$|A {{central theme}} of The Portage {{is the nature of}} language. Rosenbaum says that Steiner's [...] "fascination and... {{distrust}} of speech, the love and hate for the power and terror of language, has been {{at the very heart of}} [...] remarkable career as literary prodigy and prodigal." [...] Steiner told Rosenbaum that [...] "in the German language, Hitler drew on a kind of rhetorical power which, in a way that is perhaps a little bit peculiar to German, allies highly abstract concepts with political, physical violence in <b>a</b> <b>most</b> <b>unusual</b> way". Hitler's genius lay [...] "not so much in the written word, but the embodied voice", which Steiner described as [...] "mesmeric". Rosenbaum notes that Steiner describes Hitler as [...] "a kind of medium for the evil genius of the German language itself" [...] and that his language is [...] "like 'antimatter' to ordinary language".|$|E

2500|$|As an {{amphibian}} the Kittiwake {{needed to}} have a retractable undercarriage, <b>a</b> <b>most</b> <b>unusual</b> feature at this time. [...] The two main wheels were retracted with a hand crank into boxes within the hull, placed {{between the first and}} second step. [...] These boxes had cam-operated doors to preserve the hull surface. [...] Inevitably, this arrangement led to a very narrow track undercarriage. [...] At the rear of the hull/central float was a combined water rudder/ tailskid. [...] Stabilising floats with planing bottoms were fixed to the lower wing below the outermost interplane struts.|$|E
2500|$|It will {{be noted}} that Mound A is almost the exact center of the site, <b>a</b> <b>most</b> <b>unusual</b> {{location}} for the dominant mound in ceremonial centers of the Coles Creek and Mississippi periods. In the case of centers the plaza is normally the central feature with the principal [...] "temple mound" [...] located on one side, usually but not always the west, its principal ramp giving access from the plaza {{on the east side}} of the mound. In the case of Holly Bluff there seems to have been two plazas to the east and west of the Mound A respectively.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{young man}} Bruckner sang in men's choirs and wrote music for them. Bruckner's secular choral music was mostly written for choral societies. The texts are always in German. Some of these works were written {{specifically}} for private occasions such as weddings, funerals, birthdays or name-days, many of these being dedicated to friends and acquaintances of the composer. This music is rarely performed. Biographer Derek Watson characterizes the pieces for men's choir as being [...] "of little concern to the non-German listener". Of about 30 such pieces, <b>a</b> <b>most</b> <b>unusual</b> and evocative composition is the song Abendzauber (1878) for men's choir, man soloist, yodelers and four horns.|$|E

He showed <b>a</b> liberality <b>most</b> <b>unusual</b> at the time to Protestant dissenters, whom he wished to reunite with the established church. He held several conferences on the subject with the clergy of his diocese; and in the hope of influencing candid minds by means of the opinions of unbiased foreigners, he obtained letters treating of the question (since printed at the end of Stillingfleet's Unreasonableness of Separation) from Le Moyne, professor of divinity at Leiden, and the famous French Protestant divine, Jean Claude.|$|R

He was in a profuse perspiration; which must have been owing to the warmth of his feelings, notwithstanding we had supposed him a man of no heart. But his benevolent haste upon this occasion was subsequently accounted for: it merely arose from professional curiosity to behold <b>a</b> case <b>most</b> <b>unusual</b> in his Polynesian practice.

2500|$|Sarah {{grew up to}} be an {{attractive}} woman. She caused some surprise by marrying John Austin (1790–1859) on 24 August 1819. During the first years of their married life they lived a wide social life in Queen's Square, Westminster. John Stuart Mill testified the esteem which he felt for her by the title of Mutter, by which he always addressed her. Jeremy Bentham was also in their circle. She travelled widely, for instance to Dresden and Weimar. According to a modern scholar, Austin [...] "tended to be austere, reclusive, and insecure, while she was very determined, ambitious, energetic, gregarious, and warm. Indeed her affections were so starved that in the early 1830s she had <b>a</b> <b>most</b> <b>unusual</b> 'affair' with , a German prince whose work she translated.

2500|$|If a {{death is}} to be faked, however, a {{substitute}} body has to be found, and it was David A.

Also of possible relevance is that the same William Danby would have been responsible for authorizing exactly what was to happen to Penry's corpse. Those who reject the theory claim that there would have been far too many obvious signs that the corpse had been hanged for it to have been used in this way, although Marlovians say that Danby, being solely in charge, would have been able quite easily to ensure that such evidence remained hidden from the jury.|$|E

60|$|It was then, that my comrade observed, {{that the}} {{brigantine}} had no boats, <b>a</b> circumstance <b>most</b> <b>unusual</b> in {{any sort of}} a vessel at sea. But marking this, I was exceedingly gratified. It seemed to indicate, as I had opined, that from some cause or other, {{she must have been}} abandoned of her crew. And in a good measure this dispelled my fears of foul play, and the apprehension of contagion. Encouraged by these reflections, I now resolved to descend, and explore the cabin, though sorely against Jarl's counsel. To be sure, as he earnestly said, this step might have been deferred till daylight; but it seemed too wearisome to wait. So bethinking me of our tinder-box and candles, I sent him into the boat for them. Presently, two candles were lit; one of which the Skyeman tied up and down the barbed end of his harpoon; so that upon going below, the keen steel might not be far off, should the light be blown out by a dastard.|$|R

His subsequent attacks on Eden in the press culminated in a scathing biography, The Rise and Fall of Sir Anthony Eden (1959).|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1951, a young cyclist named Jeffrey O'Brien {{would become}} {{arguably the most}} {{dominant}} champion ever. He joined Gill as a four-time champion from 1951 to 1955. His chance at making that total five was interrupted by <b>a</b> <b>most</b> <b>unusual</b> race in 1953. The story goes that Cycling Association officials felt O'Brien was too dominant and might affect the sport's development. They planned a stratagem involving four junior riders (under eighteen) who would receive a half-hour headstart on the seniors. O'Brien and the peloton caught all but one, the eventual winner, Clinton Castillo. The incident has become a treasured part of Belizean cycling lore. O'Brien would retire in 1955 and never race again. But a new dynasty was to emerge, featuring a team of cycling brothers, the Miguels. Edward, Arthur, John and Rudy would share 11 of the next 13 Classics between them, though not without some controversy. In 1958, John Miguel's finish with contender Duncan Vernon was ruled a dead heat, {{the only one in}} Classic history. In 1961, brother Edward thought he had the race won and raised his hands in the air accordingly, only to be disqualified in favour of Vernon and Arthur Miguel. John won the most titles of the quartet with four, followed by Edward's three, and Arthur and Rudy with two each. Other winners during the period were Clinton Castillo in 1967 and Kenneth Sutherland. In 1971, an international participant won for the first time, Mexico's Pablo Calderon, but he won on the Northern Highway, where Cross Countries have occasionally been held. In 1972, Cayo's Anthony Hutchinson, nicknamed [...] "The Tank", demolished Calderon and the Miguels for his first title on the Western Highway, then repeated in 1973 ahead of Kenrick Halliday, then an unknown.
