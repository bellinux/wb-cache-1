500|$|While Joy {{declared}} Dracula [...] "quite satisfactory {{from the}} standpoint of the Code" [...] before it was released, and the film had little trouble reaching theaters, Frankenstein was a different story. New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts removed the scene where the monster unintentionally drowns <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>and</b> lines that referenced Dr. Frankenstein's God complex. Kansas, in particular, objected to the film. The state's censor board requested the cutting of 32 scenes, which if removed, would have halved the length of the film.|$|E

Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated {{to pursue a career}} in entertainment, and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio. At age seven, Jackson performed at the Las Vegas Strip at the MGM Casino and began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976. The year after, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times. She later starred in A New Kind of Family before joining the cast of Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey for two years. Jackson also played the recurring role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series. When Jackson was sixteen, she was arranged a contract with A Records and released her self-titled debut album in 1982. She stated, [...] "On my first album the songs were sort of teenage like. I wanted to make a change for my second album. The first album indroduces you. The second one sets your image. I couldn't stay like that. People would still look at me as <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>and</b> I'd never grow". [...] "Don't Stand Another Chance" [...] was written by Jackson, her brother Marlon Jackson and musician John Barnes. Marlon Jackson also produced the single and provided backing vocals along with his brothers Michael, Tito, and Jackie. Although it was slated for a mid-July release, [...] "Don't Stand Another Chance" [...] was released on August 13, 1984.|$|E

In the three-part [...] "Snow White and the Green Flame" [...] (Biancaneve e verde fiamma), the Queen flies on a broom {{to the great}} gathering of witches, who declare that her inability to deal with just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>and</b> few dwarfs has disgraced them all and she should be punished for this according {{to the laws of}} Hell. The Queen begs the High Witch for mercy and is given a magic wand with the power of transformation, but if she would not succeed this time she will be turned into a magic broom for a more [...] "honorable" [...] witch to fly. The Queen uses the wand to gain trust of Snow White and turn her a figurine, than takes the princess' form to ambush the dwarfs and do the same with them, and waits for the Prince's arrival to kill him. Only Dopey escapes and eventually manages to outwit the Queen, using her want to restore his friends and transform her into a figurine, which later turns into a broom when her sentence is carried over.

2500|$|In 1979, Lee {{accepted}} {{the role of}} Karen Fairgate on Knots Landing, a spin-off of the immensely popular Dallas. Though slow to start, the series eventually became a ratings hit {{and became one of}} the longest-running American primetime dramas ever, lasting for a total of 14 seasons from 1979 - 1993. Due to her long-running tenure, Lee's alter ego is often credited as being the center of the program. Television personality Joan Rivers commented that Lee was, in theory, the [...] "First Lady of Knots Landing" [...] during her guest appearance on The Late Show, which Rivers hosted at the time. The characters of the serial often represented what was happening in society at the time. Lee acknowledged that, saying: [...] "Karen wanted to be a Pollyanna and wasn't ashamed of that. Remember in our society, maybe people don't remember, but remember when we could go over to other people's houses and come in through an open back door? I remember when I was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>and</b> my mother and father would have people over and they'd walk into an unlocked door in our house." [...] Lee was the only performer to appear in all of the show's 344 episodes.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, Adrianne León was {{announced}} {{to become a}} recast {{for the role of}} Colleen. Leon wanted to portray Colleen as more grown up and a little different from Fonseca's take on the role, saying she would be [...] "coming back with a whole new determination to get what she wants" [...] and that [...] "she didn't have any expectations set in stone, but it's always hard to see your first love with someone else". When Colleen returned, she acted as an obstacle in J.T.'s romance with Mackenzie Browning (then Rachel Kimsey). When Kimsey was let go and Mackenzie exited, J.T. and Colleen reunited, and another obstacle designed to break them up {{came in the form of}} a new character, Adrian Korbel (Eyal Podell). León theorized that while Colleen felt an attraction to Korbel, her heart belonged to J.T., saying: [...] "She absolutely loves him and adores him, but she's going through that change where she was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>and</b> now she's not. She's growing up and evolving. The bad boy was interesting to her when she was a teenager, but now she's more interested in the intellectual." [...] Leon portrayed the character as confused while she conflicted between her love for J.T. and her attraction to Korbel. Colleen later cheated on J.T. with him, and they separated for the final time.|$|E
2500|$|Though Elsie's mysterious {{disappearance}} {{and death}} were once {{the subject of}} intense police investigation and journalistic focus, her story faded into obscurity until the death of Henry Darger in 1973. Michael Bonesteel, an art historian examining Darger's work, found repeated reference in Darger's Story of the Vivian Girls novel to Annie Aronburg, leader of a child slave rebellion, and to an inspirational picture of her that had been lost. Miss Aronburg had met a shocking yet heroic death {{at the hands of}} her captors. (The murder is described in detail, and is nothing like Elsie's death.) According to his diary, Darger really had lost a picture of <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>and</b> was desperate to get it back or replace it. He did not give the name but said it had appeared in the [...] "Chicago Daily Noise (sic), May, June, or July, 1911." [...] Bonesteel's search in the newspaper archives revealed Elsie Paroubek and her story. A portrait of Annie Aronburg by Darger shows a somewhat older blonde-haired girl. Her hair ribbon and the distinctive collar of her dress are similar to Elsie's in the photograph. In the novel, Darger describes children who are kidnapped and mistreated by adults, while the heroic little Vivians, Annie Aronburg and others form [...] "rescue squads" [...] to save them.|$|E
