Materials and Methods: Twenty-one similar acrylic resin blocks were prepared and divided into three study groups: Group A (snap attachment) - 10 specimens, Group B (locator attachment) - 1 specimen, and Group C (syncone attachment) - 10 specimens. A single rectangular heat cure acrylic resin block with two implant analogs 22 mm apart was used with all specimens. Each specimen was subjected to 5500 cycles of insertion and removal in the presence of artificial saliva, representing 5 years of usage. Retention was measured three times for each specimen using universal testing machine. Data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance at 95 % level of confidence. Results: Locator <b>attachment</b> <b>group</b> (Group B) showed the greatest retention level throughout the study, followed by snap <b>attachment</b> (<b>Group</b> A), and syncone <b>attachment</b> (<b>Group</b> C) showed the lowest retention level. Conclusion: Regardless of the initial retention level of overdenture attachment, gradual loss of retention values is inevitable.

40|$|Detailed {{understanding}} of electron transfer reactions {{is important in}} many aspects of chemistry, biology and solar energy conversion. The main aim of this thesis is to provide further insight into electron transfer through highly conjugated bridge structures. Towards this end, three series of donor-acceptor dyads have been studied, all using an oligo(1, 4 -phenylene-ethynylene) moiety as the bridge. A common theme in these series is that they explore the effects of having either an ethynylene or phenylene as the <b>attachment</b> <b>group</b> between the bridge and the donor or acceptor. Photophysical characterization of these dyads {{was carried out by}} means of time resolved laser spectroscopy. The results show that having an ethynylene as <b>attachment</b> <b>group</b> results in higher rates for bridge mediated electron and energy transfer compared to similar systems, where a phenylene was used. It was also found that most of the investigated systems show a fast back electron transfer. A notable exception is a zinc(II) phthalocyanine- gold(III) porphyrin dyad, where very fast photoinduced electron transfer (kPET = 1. 0 × 1012 s- 1) was followed by relatively slow back electron transfer (kBET = 1. 0 × 109 s- 1). A complementary DFT investigation indicated that the charge shifted state involves a reduction of the gold ion, rather than the porphyrin ring. This results in lower electronic coupling between the reduced gold porphyrin and the bridge and thus slower back electron transfer. A series of zinc porphyrin platinum acetylide dyads was used to explore the effects on electronic coupling of different attachments points on the porphyrin ring. For the investigated system it was found that linking at the meso-position results in an eight-fold increase in electron transfer rate compared to the β-position. In addition, a series of mixed valence compounds was used to investigate electronic coupling mediated by cross-hyperconjugated or cross-π-conjugated bridges. The results indicate coupling elements of 100 - 400 cm- 1, with the cross-π-conjugated bridge having the largest coupling. A complementary TD-DFT study indicates that both through bond and through space coupling can be active in these systems. The relative contribution of these two mechanisms to the electronic coupling is highly conformer dependent...|$|E

It was hypothesized that working models of self and other that comprise the attachment system are related to perceptions of social support interactions.

Preoccupied respondents reported a stronger desire than dismissing avoidant respondents for social support of all types {{with the exception of}} companionship.

Secure subjects found all types of support more helpful than the insecure <b>attachment</b> <b>groups.</b> Fearful avoidant and preoccupied subjects were less likely than other subjects to choose to interact with a person providing esteem-bolstering support.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{there has been}} an {{increase}} of experimental research on automatic unconscious processes concerning the evaluation of the self and others. Previous research investigated implicit aspects of romantic attachment using self-report measures as explicit instruments for assessing attachment style. There is a lack of experimental procedures feasible for neurobiological settings. We developed a reaction time experiment (RT) using a narrative attachment measure with an implicit nature and were interested to capture automatic processes, when the individuals’ attachment system is activated. We aimed to combine attachment methodology with knowledge from implicit measures by using a decision reaction time paradigm. This should serve as a means to capture implicit aspects of attachment. This experiment evaluated participants’ response to prototypic attachment sentences in association with their own attachment classification, measured with the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP). First the AAP was administered as the standardized interview procedure to 30 healthy participants, which were classified into a secure or insecure group. In the following experimental session, both experimenter and participants were blind with respect to classifications. 128 prototypically secure or insecure sentences related to the 8 pictures of the AAP were presented to the participants. Their response and reaction times were recorded. Based on the response (accept, reject) a continuous security scale was defined. Both the AAP classification and security scale were related to the reaction times. Differentiated study hypotheses were confirmed for insecure sentences, which were accepted faster by participants from the insecure <b>attachment</b> <b>group</b> (or with lower security scale), and rejected faster by participants form secure <b>attachment</b> <b>group</b> (or with higher security scale). The elaborating unconscious processes were more activated by insecure sentences with potential attachment conflicts. The introduced paradigm is able to contribute to an experimental approach in attachment research. The Reaction Time analysis with the narrative procedure might be of interest for a broader variety of questions in experimental and neurophysiological settings to capture unconscious processes in association to internal working models of attachment. An electrophysiological model based on preliminary research is proposed for assessing the preconscious neuronal network related to secure or insecure attachment representations...|$|E

As pre-dicted, ‘‘involved’ ’ students had practically and statistically significantly higher group attachment than ‘‘noninvolved’ ’ students.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the influence of weak parental and peer attachment on academic achievement among late adolescent college students. In previous research, weak attachment to parents and/or peers had {{been found to have}} an adverse influence on the academic success of college students. This study also examined the potential moderating influence of several cognitive and non-cognitive psychosocial variables that might act as protective factors for weakly attached students and, therefore, enhance their academic co etece. Data regarding attachment, cognitive variables, and non-cognitive variables were collected using several self-report measures. The multi-ethnic sample of students in this study (n = 357) attended an urban university. Students were classified into one of nine parental-peer <b>attachment</b> <b>groups</b> (e. g., Low-Low, Medium-Medium, High-High). <b>Attachment</b> <b>groups</b> were compared in terms of cognitive and non-cognitive variables. Contrary to the hypothesis, no statistically significant academic achievement differences were revealed for the group of college students who perceived themselves to be weakly attached to both parents and peers. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) identified the High- High group to be significantly different in terms of academic outcome variables from the other eight groups while the Low-Low group had significantly lower levels of noncognitive variables than several of the other <b>attachment</b> <b>groups.</b> Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that cognitive variables accounted for significant amounts of variance in academic outcomes and that several non-cognitive variables were significant predictors of scholastic competence. Correlational analyses revealed that parental and peer attachment were positively correlated with several cognitive and non-cognitive variables but neither was significantly correlated w self-reported college GPA. In general, the findings do not provide support for a in effect of weak attachment to parents and peers upon academic adversity among college students. Results suggest that both cognitive variables and non-cognitive variables may moderate academic risk due to weak attachment to parents and peers. Descriptive within group analyses of the Low-Low group revealed a heterogeneous group of students with regards to academic outcomes and scores on non cognitive measures. Gender and ethnic differences were found for attachment status but not for cognitive or non-cognitive variables.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis is to apply {{attachment}} theory {{as a predictor of}} individual-level experiences in organizational work groups. Individuals with different <b>group</b> <b>attachment</b> styles (e. g., secure, preoccupied, dismissive avoidant, and fearful avoidant) were studied with respect to activation of the <b>group</b> <b>attachment</b> system, as well as their task and relationship conflict attributions in groups that were (or were perceived to be) homogeneous and heterogeneous. The participants of Study 1 were 129 students at the John Molson School of Business. The participants of Study 2 were 87 employees at an international Hi-Technology firm. Results indicate that the perceived and/or actual presence of diversity is correlated with the activation of the <b>group</b> <b>attachment</b> system in work groups. Activation of the attachment system is known to inhibit the exploration of, and learning about, other group members’ thoughts and emotions (Rom & Mikulincer, 2003). Findings also indicate that <b>group</b> <b>attachment</b> anxiety and avoidance are positively correlated to reported attributions of relationship and task conflict, and that people with different attachment styles report attributing different amounts of task and relationship conflict. Finally, when comparing individuals’ reported experiences in groups that are perceived to be homogeneous to those that are (or are perceived to be) heterogeneous, differences in task and relationship conflict attributions seem to depend on <b>group</b> <b>attachment</b> styles. An important practical implication of this research is that activation of the <b>attachment</b> system by <b>group</b> diversity may be a significant liability in jobs where exploration and learning are required for group performance and outcomes. Further, it could be that inhibiting the activation of the <b>group</b> <b>attachment</b> system may reduce the negative effects of diversity and conflict attributions in groups.

Growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis relies on a pathway in which the lipoate <b>attachment</b> <b>group</b> is synthesized from an endogenously produced octanoic acid moiety. In patients with multiple-drug-resistant M. tuberculosis, expression of one gene from this pathway, lipB, encoding for octanoyl-[acyl carrier protein]-protein acyltransferase is considerably up-regulated, thus making it a potential target in the search for novel antiinfectives against tuberculosis. Here we present the crystal structure of the M. tuberculosis LipB protein at atomic resolution, showing an unexpected thioether-linked active-site complex with decanoic acid. We provide evidence that the transferase functions as a cysteine/lysine dyad acyltransferase, in which two invariant residues (Lys- 142 and Cys- 176) are likely to function as acid/base catalysts. Analysis by MS reveals that the LipB catalytic reaction proceeds by means of an internal thioesteracyl intermediate.

Secure infants used strategies of positive social engagement more than insecure avoidant infants, while resistant infants displayed greater negative social engagement and less object orientation {{than the other two}} groups. Avoidant infants adopted positive and negative hetero-regulatory strategies less than the other groups, also differing from resistant infants in their greater use of object regulatory strategies. There were no significant differences as regards self-comforting regulation. Thus, the findings showed how the most significant differences to emerge between the groups concerned hetero-regulatory strategies, developed by the infant in interaction with attachment figures, and regulatory strategies oriented towards objects. Further analysis showed how the use by part of each <b>attachment</b> <b>group</b> of the emotion regulation strategies varies, differentiating the episodes of the SSP according to their level of stress.

A comparison of ball, bar and Locator (Zest Anchors, Inc, homepage, Escondido, CA, USA) attachments, in completely edentulous patients with two, three or four implants, was conducted. Material and methods: A total of 36 edentulous patients (20 female, 16 male) {{with a mean age}} of 66. 3 years, were enrolled in the study. The patients were treated with 95 implants, for the prosthetic restoration of the maxilla or the mandible. The mean follow-up time was 41. 17 months. Prosthetic complications including, fractured overdentures, replacements of O-ring attachment and retention clips, implant failures, hygiene problems, mucosal enlargements, attachment fractures, retention loss and dislodgement of the attachments were recorded and evaluated. The recall visits at 3, 6, 12 months and, annually thereafter. Results: Fourteen complications in the ball <b>attachment</b> <b>group</b> and 7 complications in the bar group were observed.

40|$|Background: Research {{suggests}} {{that individuals with}} different attachment patterns process social information differently, {{especially in terms of}} facial emotion recognition. However, few studies have explored social information processes in adolescents. This study examined the behavioral and ERP correlates of emotional processing in adolescents with different attachment orientations (insecure <b>attachment</b> <b>group</b> and secure attachment group; IAG and SAG, respectively). This study also explored the association of these correlates to individual neuropsychological profiles. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used {{a modified version of the}} dual valence task (DVT), in which participants classify stimuli (faces and words) according to emotional valence (positive or negative). Results showed that the IAG performed significantly worse than SAG on tests of executive function (EF attention, processing speed, visuospatial abilities and cognitive flexibility). In the behavioral DVT, the IAG presented lower performance and accuracy. The IAG also exhibited slower RTs for stimuli with negative valence. Compared to the SAG, the IAG showed a negative bias for faces; a larger P 1 and attenuated N 170 component over the right hemisphere was observed. A negative bias was also observed in the IAG for word stimuli, which was demonstrated by comparing the N 170 amplitude of the IAG with the valence of the SAG. Finally, the amplitude of the N 170 elicited by the facial stimuli correlated with EF in both groups (and negative valence with EF in the IAG). Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that individuals with different attachment patterns process key emotional information and corresponding EF differently. This is evidenced by an early modulation of ERP components' amplitudes, which are correlated with behavioral and neuropsychological effects. In brief, attachments patterns appear to impact multiple domains, such as emotional processing and EFs. © 2013 Escobar et al. Fil:Sigman, M. Universidad de Buenos Aires.

Simultaneous elution of a multi-metal solution demonstrated that peptides possessing only two Cys residues and four Asp residues were sufficient to yield selective binding of Cd 2 + over Ni 2 + and Co 2 + similar to the selectivity of a six-Cys residue chain but with 60 % more Cd 2 + capacity. Interestingly, peptides supported on Tentagel resin appeared to reach equilibrium with metal-containing influent flow rates of at most 2 ml/min (or a linear velocity of 11 cm/s) and is attributed to better mass transport with the resin than with the CPG. Conditional stability constants calculated for the six-Asp residue chain and each metal showed the majority of sites having a log K {{in the range of}} 4. 6 - 4. 8. The peptides studied were also able to efficiently preconcentrate solutions containing as little as 0. 05 mu g/ml Cd 2 + or Ni 2 + in an artificial seawater matrix. Uniquely, the seven residue peptides showed surprisingly high metal capacities and metal-to-residue binding ratios (reaching similar to 1 : 2),and are an order of magnitude better than results previously obtained for longer chain polyamino acids (50 - 70 residues) attached to CPG via silane chemistry.

Several instruments and procedures that focused on (11 maternal and infant characteristics, (2) mother-infant interaction, and (3) life stress, were used to collect data from 212 Ugh risk pairs of mothers and infants. The collection of data began during the prenatal period and continued through the infant's first year of life. Attachment was assessed when the babies were 12 months of age. Using the Strange Situation Procedure researchers classified infants as anxious/avodiant (Group A), securely attached (Group 13), or anxious/resistant (Group C). Overall group differences among the three <b>attachment</b> <b>groups</b> were tested by a one-way ANOVA and the Student-Yewman-Keuls was used for post hoc comparisons. Result...|$|R
