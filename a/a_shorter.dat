5|$|There are two modern breeds of cocker spaniel, the English Cocker Spaniel and the American Cocker Spaniel. They were bred as gun dogs; to {{use their}} sense of smell to cover low areas near the handler in order to flush birds into the air to be shot, and {{to use their}} eyes and nose to locate the bird once downed, and then to {{retrieve}} the bird with a soft mouth. The major differences between the English and American varieties is that the American is smaller with <b>a</b> <b>shorter</b> back, a domed head and <b>a</b> <b>shorter</b> muzzle, while the English variety is taller with a narrower head and chest.|$|E

5|$|A less {{invasive}} {{approach is}} thoracoscopy, {{usually in the}} form of a procedure called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The results from VATS-based pleural abrasion are slightly worse than those achieved using thoracotomy in the short term, but produce smaller scars in the skin. Compared to open thoracotomy, VATS offers <b>a</b> <b>shorter</b> in-hospital stays, less need for postoperative pain control, and a reduced risk of lung problems after surgery. VATS may also be used to achieve chemical pleurodesis; this involves insufflation of talc, which activates an inflammatory reaction that causes the lung to adhere to the chest wall.|$|E
5|$|A single {{mandible}} from Porto Spanjo (one of {{the sites}} where fossils of A.donovani have been found), without preserved molars, differs from all Agathaeromys dentaries and is thought to represent an unknown different sigmodontine rodent.
