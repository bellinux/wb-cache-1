By Susan Hennigan hile the Clean Air Act Amendments propose fugitive emission leak rates from 10, 000 parts per million (ppm) to 500 ppm,l some facilities consider a component that emits as low as 100 ppm volatile organic compounds (VOCs) a problem. The emphasis now is on compliance in a cost-effective and reliable manner to ensure a cleaner environment and greater efficiency at the plant. Method 21 is the process specified by EPA for monitoring fugitive emissions at valves, pumps, compressors and other components. The method is designed as a screening procedure {{and in some cases}} provides a wide range of instrument specifications. The intent of these specifications is to standardize the test procedure while not limiting’the method to only one type of detection method or analyzer. Variable results have been obtained by different instruments that fall at either end, but within the stated design criteria. For example, the distance between the component and the <b>analyzer</b> <b>probe</b> tip, the strength of the analyzer internal sampling pump and ambient wind velocity will affect the level of leaker status. Again, the intent is not to limit the choice of analyzer employed, but to offer to the user the “Best Available Technology ” for a particular product/plant monitoring program...|$|E
40|$|Microwave {{materials}} {{have been widely}} used in a variety of applications ranging from communication devices to military satellite services, and the study of materials properties at microwave frequencies and the development of functional microwave {{materials have}} always been among the most active areas in solid-state physics, materials science, and electrical and electronic engineering. In recent years, the increasing requirements for the development of high speed, high frequency circuits and systems require complete understanding of the properties of materials function at microwave frequencies. Ferroelectric materials usually have high dielectric constants, and their dielectric properties are temperature and electric field dependent. The change in permittivity as a function of electric field is the key {{to a wide range of}} applications. Ferroelectric materials can be used in fabrication capacitors for electronic industry because of their high dielectric constants, and this is important in the trend toward miniaturization and high functionality of electronic products. The simple tunable passive component based on ferroelectric films is a varactor which can be made as a planar structure, and electrically tunable microwave integrated circuits using ferroelectric thin films can be developed. Therefore, it is very important to characterize the dielectric constant and tunability of ferroelectric thin films. This thesis shows experimental results for growth, crystalline properties and microwave characterization of Na 0. 5 K 0. 5 NbO 3 (NKN), AgTa 0. 5 Nb 0. 5 O 3 (ATN), Ba 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 TiO 3 (BST) as well as AgTaO 3 (ATO), AgNbO 3 (ANO) thin films. The films were grown by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) and rf-magnetron sputtering of a stoichiometric, high density, ceramic NKN, ATN, BST target onto single crystal LaAlO 3 (LAO), Al 2 O 3 (sapphire), and Nd:YAlO 3, and amorphous glass substrates. By x-ray diffractometry, NKN, ATN, BST films on LAO substrates were found to grow epitaxially, whereas films on r-cut sapphire substrates were found to be preferentially (00 l) oriented. Coplanar waveguide interdigital capacitor (CPWIDC) structures were fabricated by standard photolithography processing and metal lift-off technique. Microwave properties of the NKN/Sapphire and ATN/Sapphire with CPW structures were characterized using on-wafer microwave measurement technique. Measurement setup is composed of network <b>analyzer,</b> <b>probe</b> station, and microwave G-S-G probes. External electric field through the connection between network analyzer and power supply was applied to measure voltage tunability. Measured S-parameter were used for the calculation of capacitance, loss tanδ, tunability and K-factor. The NKN films interdigital capacitors with 2 μm finger gap on Nd:YAlO 3 showed superior performance compared to ATN in the microwave range from 1 to 40 GHz. Within this range, the voltage tunability (40 V, 200 kV/cm) was about 29 %, loss tangent ∼ 0. 13, K-factor = tunability/tanδ from 152 % @ 10 GHz to 46 % @ 40 GHz. The microwave performance of ATN film CPWIDC with 2 μm finger gap on sapphire substrate in the microwave range from 1 to 40 GHz showed that frequency dispersion is about 4. 3 %, voltage tunability was 4. 7 % @ 20 GHz and 200 kV/cm, loss tangent ∼ 0. 068 @ 20 GHz, K-factor = tunability/tanδ is ranged from 124 % @ 10 GHz to 35 % @ 40 GHz. The BST films CPWIDC with 2 μmfinger gap on Al 2 O 3 substrate showed frequency dispersion of capacitance in the microwave range from 1 to 40 GHz about 17 %, voltage tunability = 1 - C(40 V) /C(0) ∼ 22. 2 %, loss tangent ∼ 0. 137 @ 20 GHz, and K-factor = tunability/tanδ from 281 % @ 10 GHz to 95 % @ 40 GHz.

Extending {{out from}} two opposite sides are solar panel wings containing silicon solar cells which provide {{power to the}} spacecraft directly or via NiMH (nickel metal hydride) batteries. On the top surface is a dish antenna, and a propulsion unit protrudes from the bottom. A 5 m deployable mast and a 1 m boom extend from the sides, along with two pairs of thin wire antennas which measure 50 m tip to tip. Other instruments are also arranged {{along the sides of}} the spacecraft. Spacecraft communications are via X-band at 8410.93 MHz and S-band at 2293.89 MHz. The 14 instruments carried on Nozomi are an imaging camera, neutral mass spectrometer, dust counter, thermal plasma analyzer, magnetometer, electron and ion spectrum analyzers, ion mass spectrograph, high energy particles experiment, VUV imaging spectrometer, sounder and plasma wave detector, LF wave <b>analyzer,</b> electron temperature <b>probe,</b> and a UV scanner. The total mass budgeted for the science instruments was 33 kg. Radio science experiments were also possible using the existing radio equipment and an ultrastable oscillator. The total mass of Nozomi at launch including 282 kg of propellant was 540 kg.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the characteristics of}} inorganic elements in ashes from biomass gasification power generation (BGPG) plant. The ash samples of the gasifier ash, separator ash and wet scrubber ash were collected in a 1 MW circulating fluidized bed (CFB) wood gasification power generation plant. Particle size distribution of ashes was determined by gravimetric measurement and super <b>probe</b> <b>analyzer.</b> The concentrations of trace elements and major ash-forming elements, such as As, Al, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, K, Mg, Na, Ni, Ph, Ti in different ashes {{as a function of}} particle size were determined by Inductive Coupled Plasma Spectrometer. The concentrations and distribution coefficient and enrichment factors of the inorganic elements in ashes were studied. X-ray fluorescence spectrometer and X-ray powder diffraction were used to provide information on the characteristics of the ashes. The results showed that most of the trace elements had an enrichment tendency in the finer size particles. A considerable amount of the ashes was residual carbon. Most of the volatile e. g. halogen elements and alkali elements existed mainly in wet scrubber ash and enriched in fly ash. Most of the Si, Ni, Pb, Zn, Cr, Cd were found in separator ash, indicating an enrichment of heavy metal elements in separator ash. K, S, Mn, Cu mainly existed in gasifier ash. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.
