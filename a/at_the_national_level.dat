5|$|In {{addition}} to the armed conflict, there are other explanations for this situation: Municipalities tend to use their financial resources from the Sistema General de Participaciones or General Participation System (Law 715 of 2001) mainly in urban areas.

40|$|Abstract This study {{focuses on}} the spatial data {{implementation}} in the developing countries, with specific interest in an African case. It advocates {{for the implementation of}} spatial data <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lower tiers of governments in the developing countries, the case of Africa. A subjective study of texts on regional spatial data implementation and web survey of geoportals of some twenty African countries form the basis for analysis and discussion. Studies on regional spatial data implementation showed that, most of them have standards and policy monitoring regional bodies while Africa has none. It was observed that out of the twenty countries surveyed, only five of them have functional geoportals through which spatial data can be easily and readily viewed and accessed, the rest are in one form of partnership/donor agreements. It was also observed that spatial data implementation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>levels</b> have not achieved much in terms of data production, exchange and sharing. This study believes that, {{as a result of these}} failures <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>levels,</b> <b>the</b> advocacy for the implementation of spatial data <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lower tiers of governments would effectively enhance the production of spatial data applying the bottom-up approach as against the traditional top down-approach...|$|R
