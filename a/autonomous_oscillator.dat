The non-linear correction is found to be proportional to the square of the perturbation.

Here we propose a new self-sustaining scheme that relies on the nonlinearity originating from the resonator itself to limit the oscillation amplitude, while the feedback remains linear. We introduce a model to describe the working principle of the self-sustained oscillations and validate it with experiments performed on a nonlinear microelectromechanical (MEMS) based oscillator.

We find {{that the existence of}} synaptic connections between any two cortical columns does not guarantee that the columns interact: They interact only when there is a certain nearly resonant relation between their frequencies, which implies that the interactions are frequency modulated (FM). When the resonant relation holds, the cortical columns interact through phase modulations. Thus, communications between weakly connected cortical oscillators employ an FM radio principle: the frequency of oscillation encodes the channel of communication, while the information is transmitted via phase modulations.

A special Ansatz of a displaced phase-amplitude equation {{with respect to}} a background is used as has been proposed by van Groesen et. al. (2006). Requiring the displaced phase to be temporally independent, has as consequence that the dynamics at each position is described by the motion of a nonlinear <b>autonomous</b> <b>oscillator</b> in a potential energy that depends on the phase and on the spatial phase change. The relation among the breather solutions is confirmed by explicit expressions, and illustrated with the amplitude amplification factor.
