40|$|Unsaturated {{fatty acid}} auxotrophs of Eschericha coli have been {{divided into two}} {{distinct}} cistrons by extract complementation and genetic complementation based on <b>abortive</b> <b>transduction.</b> Lesions in one cistron result {{in the loss of}} the β-hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydrase which produces the first biosynthetic intermediate in unsaturated fatty acid formation. Evidence is presented which indicates that lesions in the second cistron result in the lack of a second enzyme specifically involved in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids...|$|E
40|$|Six auxotrophic {{markers of}} a halotolerant collagenolytic strain of Achromobacter were transduced by four a phages. <b>Abortive</b> <b>transduction</b> was also demonstrated. The {{generalized}} transduction system is unusual as the transductants were unstable, characteristic of transduction by lysogeny. The Achromobacter strain is a cryptic lysogen for a and purified transductants were either sensitive or resistant to a. Purified clones from four resistant transductants and one sensitive transductant liberated phage spontaneously. The host ranges of these spontaneous phages differed {{from that of}} the a phage used for the transduction experiment. Some initially resistant transductants became semi-sensitive to a (efficiency of plating [e. o. p. ] 10 - 1 to I O- ~) after repeated cloning...|$|E
40|$|The {{order of}} mutational sites in 10 {{independently}} isolated leucine auxotrophys of Escherichia coli K- 12 {{was determined by}} three-point reciprocal transductions. The sites of mutation mapped in linear sequence in a cluster; all leucine auxotrophic mutations were cotransducible with mutations in the arabinose operon. The mutations were assigned to four complementation groups by <b>abortive</b> <b>transduction</b> tests, designated D, C, B, and A, reading in a clockwise direction from the arabinose operon. Enzyme analyses showed that strains with a mutation in gene A lacked α-isopropylmalate synthetase activity (EC 4. 1. 3), and those with a mutation in gene B lacked β-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase activity (EC 1. 1. 1). It is concluded that the gross structure of the leucine operon in E. coli is closely similar to, if not identical with, the gross structure of the leucine operon in Salmonella typhimurium...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Determination {{has been}} made by the {{technique}} of abortive trans-duction of the functional relationships of over 200 Salmonella typhimurium histidine mutant alleles. The results are compared with those obtained by genetic recombina-tion (Hartman, Loper & german, 1960) and enzyme studies (Ames, Garry & Her-zenberg, 1960). The results indicate that <b>abortive</b> <b>transduction</b> tests can be used to position rapidly sites of mutation on a chromosome map within the region of a single gene. The tests for genetic complementation reveal that some genes behave as single functional units, while other genes are composed of two, and some of four, functional subunits (complementation units). The existence of mutants with overlapping, intra-genic non-complementing patterns may allow crude mapping, solely by complementa-tion, of some mutational sites within certain single genes. In gene D, the ordering of mutational sites by this technique so far conforms with that obtained by the more classic methods of map construction based on inferences derived from recom-bination analyses. Data are presented bearing on the individuality of the gene and the effect of mutation thereon. It is concluded that some genetic damages, localize...|$|E
40|$|Previous workers divided threonine-requiring (Thr−) {{strains of}} Salmonella into three phenotypes with {{mutations}} in four complementation groups. The mutations were deemed to define four {{genes in the}} order thrD-C-A-B at minute zero on the Salmonella linkage map. In the present study 12 of these mutants were reexamined together with eight new Thr− strains. The three phenotypes were: homoserine-requiring (Hom−); Thr−, feeders of Hom− strains; Thr−, nonfeeders. Exact correlation between these phenotypic groups and three complementation groups was confirmed by <b>abortive</b> <b>transduction.</b> No evidence was found for intergenic complementation between mutations in Hom− strains. It is proposed that thr mutations define three genes rather than four and that these be renamed thrA (Hom−), thrB (Thr− feeders), and thrC (Thr− nonfeeders) to correspond with the sequence of reactions in threonine biosynthesis. Double mutant trpRthr strains were used in reciprocal three-point transduction tests to establish the order of thr mutation sites. Although revisions {{were made in the}} classification or location of several mutations, there was an overall correlation of complementation group, phenotype, and map position. The present data provide a basis for further correlation of threonine genes and biosynthetic enzymes, and analysis of cross regulation in aspartate amino acid biosynthesis in Salmonella...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of a lytic {{infection}} the Salmonella phage P 22 occasionally encapsulates bacterial DNA instead of phage DNA. Thus, phage lysates include two classes of viral particles. Phage particles carrying bacterial DNA are referred to as transducing particles and deliver this DNA to a host as efficiently as particles carrying phage DNA. Once injected, the transduced DNA can either recombine with the recipient chromosome to form a ``complete'' transductant, or it can establish itself as an expressible, nonreplicating genetic element and form an ``abortive'' transductant. In this work, we describe a P 22 -phage mutant with reduced ability to form abortive transductants. The mutation responsible for this phenotype, called tdx- 1, was found as one of two mutations contributing to the high-transducing phenotype of the P 22 -mutant HT 12 / 4. In addition, the tdx- 1 mutation is lethal when combined with an erf-am mutation. The tdx- 1 mutation has been mapped to a region of the P 22 genome that encodes several injected proteins and may involve more than one mutant locus. The phenotypes of the tdx- 1 mutation suggest that the Tdx protein(s) normally assist in the circularization of the P 22 genome and also contribute to the formation of DNA circles thought to be required for <b>abortive</b> <b>transduction...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{genetic control}} of {{histidine}} biosynthesis in Staphylococcus aureus was examined by {{an analysis of}} 66 histidine-dependent mutants by using stable and <b>abortive</b> <b>transduction.</b> These mutants, which previously had been differentiated into classes according to their biochemical charac-teristics, all occupied sites within a single linkage group, {{referred to as the}} histidine region. This region has been separated into six gene loci on the basis of complementation studies and the biochemical characteristics of the mutants. The order of genes within the histidine region, E, A, B, C, D, G, was determined from the results of reciprocal transductions to wild type and donor type. The order of mutant sites was also linearly related to the ability of these mutants to form histidine-independent trans-ductants when infected with phage prepared on the parent strain. This observation, and the inequalities in reciprocal transduction frequencies obtained in inter-mutant transductions, support the hypothesis that all donor fragments which participate in transductions involving the histidine region are identical, and that the histidine region is located extremely close to one terminus of the donor fragment. Intergenic complementation occurred among mutants of all gene loci; in addition, three comple-mentation units within the A gene and two complementation units within the G gene were detected...|$|E
40|$|The close linkage of the glnA gene with polA was {{exploited}} {{to construct}} a fine structure map of polA by means of generalized transduction with phage P 1. Nine different polA- alleles were mapped by recombinational crosses. The results indicate a gene order consistent with previous observations (Kelley and Grindley 1976 a; Murray and Kelley 1979). Three mutations, polA 5, polA 6 and polA 12 map within the "carboxy-terminal" or "large-fragment" portion of the gene in unambiguous order. Four alleles, known to affect the "aminoterminal" portion of the gene, polA 107, polA 214, polA 480 ex and polA 4113, appear to be closely linked with certain ambiguities in their exact order. All four of these mutations are known to alter the 5 '→ 3 ' exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I and three of them result in the conditional lethal polA- phenotype. The polA 1 nonsense mutation maps between these two groups in a position consistent with its known effect, production of an amber fragment that includes the 5 '→ 3 ' exonuclease. The final allele, resA 1, is another nonsense mutation that maps at the extreme "amino-terminus" of the cistron. ——A number of control experiments were conducted {{to determine the effects}} of polA- mutations on the P 1 -mediated recombinational event. These experiments indicated that <b>abortive</b> <b>transduction</b> occurs quite frequently, but the formation of abortive transductants and segregation of unselected transduced markers among daughter progeny is like that observed by other investigators. There was no evidence that any individual polA- allele behaved in an exceptional fashion during recombination...|$|E
