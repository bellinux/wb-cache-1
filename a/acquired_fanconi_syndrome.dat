40|$|<b>Acquired</b> <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{characterized}} by inappropriate urinary loss of amino acids, bicarbonate, electrolytes, and water. It has recently been described in dogs fed chicken jerky treats from China, a new differential diagnosis to the classical inciting infectious diseases (e. g. leptospirosis, pyelonephritis) and toxins. A dog fed exclusively chicken jerky treats purchased in Switzerland was presented to our clinic with severe polyuria, polydipsia and profound electrolyte and acid base disturbances. Other inciting causes of Fanconi syndrome were ruled out. The requirement of a very intensive supportive treatment in this dog stands in contrast to treatment of chronic forms of Fanconi syndrome {{as described in the}} Basenji. This intensive therapy and the associated monitoring can be a real challenge and a limiting factor for the prognosis of <b>acquired</b> <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Veterinarians {{should be aware of the}} risk of excessive feeding of chicken jerky treats...|$|E

40|$|The {{detailed}} study of a battery plate maker, {{who had worked with}} cadmium for 36 years, showed that proteinuria, typical of renal tubular dysfunction, had been observed for 25 years and during the last 12 years of his life the patient had suffered increasing disability from gross bone disease. Several bone biopsies and detailed metabolic studies showed typical severe osteomalacia, which responded well initially to calcium and vitamin D treatment. Examination of the liver both in life and after death showed a gross excess of cadmium. This was also found in the kidneys after death. Previously unreported changes were present in the bones, especially the lumbar vertebrae which were probably more the result of gross bone deformity than cadmium deposition. The mechanism of development of the severe <b>acquired</b> <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome</b> was thought to be a combination of dietary calcium and vitamin D deficiency and impaired calcium absorption from abnormal vitamin D synthesis, related to the cadmium deposition in the renal tubules, which also caused the defect in renal tubular reabsorption...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (VireadÂ®) is {{the only}} {{nucleotide}} reverse transcriptase inhibitor currently approved {{for the treatment of}} HIV. It is frequently prescribed not only for its efficacy but also for its decreased side effect profile compared with other nucleotide analogs. In addition, it is now increasingly recognized as a cause of <b>acquired</b> <b>Fanconi's</b> <b>syndrome</b> in individuals with HIV. Case presentation. We describe a 48 -year-old woman infected with HIV, with chronic renal insufficiency, who developed <b>Fanconi's</b> <b>syndrome</b> after inclusion of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in her antiretroviral therapy. A whole body bone scintigraphy was performed, revealing an abnormal distribution of radiotracer uptake, with characteristic changes compatible with osteomalacia. All symptoms disappeared after tenofovir discontinuation and mineral supplementation. No other explanation for the sudden and complete resolution of the bone disease was found. Conclusion. The case highlights the role of whole body bone scintigraphy in the diagnosis of tenofovir-related osteomalacia. Â© 2009 licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Tenofovir (Viread®) is a {{nucleotide}} {{reverse transcriptase}} inhibitor {{introduced into the}} United States in 2001. It is frequently prescribed {{not only for its}} efficacy but also for its decreased side effect profile compared with other nucleoside analogs. It is now increasingly recognized as a cause of <b>acquired</b> <b>Fanconi's</b> <b>syndrome</b> (FS) in human immunodeficient individuals. We describe a case of a patient with AIDS, who, after starting tenofovir therapy, developed myalgias, renal failure, and profound electrolyte abnormalities compatible with the classic features of FS. On discontinuation of tenofovir and replacement of electrolytes, the individual improved clinically with normalization of his renal failure and electrolyte abnormalities. With the success of tenofovir in the anti-HIV drug market, practitioners should remain alert to the possibility of the development of FS. Frequent urine, renal, and electrolyte parameters should be measured at regular intervals following initiation of tenofovir therapy...|$|R

40|$|The {{heavy chain}} {{diseases}} (HCDs) are rare B-cell malignancies {{characterized by the}} production of a monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain without an associated light chain. There are three types of HCD, defined by the class of immunoglobulin heavy chain produced: IgA (α-HCD), IgG (γ-HCD), and IgM (μ-HCD). Alpha-HCD is the most common and usually occurs as intestinal malabsorption in a young adult from a country of the Mediterranean area. Gamma- and μ-HCDs are more rare and associated to a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that produces an abnormal Ig heavy chain. These patients may occasionally be diagnosed with a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Fanconi syndrome, on the other hand, can be primary (inherited) or secondary (acquired). The only exception to this rule is the idiopathic form. Adult <b>acquired</b> <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome</b> can be a rare complication of a monoclonal gammopathy. At diagnosis, most patients have a MGUS or smoldering multiple myeloma, with renal failure and evidence of osteomalacia. During follow-up, patients can develop end-stage renal disease. Chemotherapy provides little benefit on renal function...|$|E
40|$|<b>Acquired</b> <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome</b> (FS) is a {{complication}} of monoclonal gammopathies featuring a generalized dysfunction of the proximal tubule of the kidney, {{due to the}} storage within proximal tubular cells of a monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain. We engineered transgenic mice in which the endogenous mouse Jkappa cluster {{was replaced by a}} human VkappaJkappa rearranged gene cloned from a patient with smoldering myeloma-associated FS. The V region belonged to the VkappaI subgroup and was related to the O 2 -O 12 germ-line gene, a V segment previously found associated with FS and light-chain crystallization in several patients with myeloma. Association of the human VkappaI domain with a mouse kappa constant domain in transgenic animals yielded a nephrotoxicity pattern similar to that observed in patients, strongly suggesting that the whole pathogenic effect of FS light chains can be ascribed to a peculiar structure of the V domain. Morphologic alterations of the kidney tubular cells, which contained rhomboid-shape crystals, were observed in mice, together with alterations of the proximal tubule reabsorption function. Moreover, the number of renal crystalline inclusions was dramatically reduced after conditional deletion of the human VkappaI transgene, showing that proximal tubular lesions are reversible upon suppression of the nephrotoxic light chain secretion...|$|E
40|$|Heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), {{chromium}} (Cr) and platinum (Pt) are a {{major environmental}} and occupational hazard. Unfortunately, these non-essential elements are toxic at very low doses and non-biodegradable with a very long biological half-life. Thus, exposure to heavy metals is potentially harmful. Because {{of its ability to}} reabsorb and accumulate divalent metals, the kidney is the first target organ of heavy metal toxicity. The extent of renal damage by heavy metals depends on the nature, the dose, route and duration of exposure. Both acute and chronic intoxication have been demonstrated to cause nephropathies, with various levels of severity ranging from tubular dysfunctions like <b>acquired</b> <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome</b> to severe renal failure leading occasionally to death. Very varied pathways are involved in uptake of heavy metals by the epithelium, depending on the form (free or bound) of the metal and the segment of the nephron where reabsorption occurs (proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule and terminal segments). In this review, we address the putative uptake pathways involved along the nephron, the mechanisms of intracellular sequestration and detoxification and the nephropathies caused by heavy metals. We also tackle the question of the possible therapeutic means of decreasing the toxic effect of heavy metals by increasing their urinary excretion without affecting the renal uptake of essential trace elements. We have chosen to focus mainly on Cd, Hg and Pb and on in vivo studies...|$|E

40|$|Cystinosis is an {{inborn error}} of {{lysosomal}} cystine transporter, resulting in cystine accumulation in lysosomes of all cells.

40|$|Plasma {{and urine}} free and acyl {{carnitine}} were measured in 19 children with nephropathic cystinosis and renal <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Each patient exhibited a deficiency of plasma free carnitine (mean 11. 7 +/- 4. 0 [SD] nmol/ml) compared with normal control values (42. 0 +/- 9. 0 nmol/ml) (P less than 0. 001). Mean plasma acyl carnitine in the cystinotic subjects was normal. Four subjects with <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome</b> but not cystinosis displayed the same abnormal pattern of plasma carnitine levels; controls with acidosis or a lysosomal storage disorder (Fabry disease), but not <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome,</b> had entirely normal plasma carnitine levels. Two postrenal transplant subjects with cystinosis but without <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome</b> also had normal plasma carnitine levels. Absolute amounts of urinary free carnitine were elevated in cystinotic individuals with <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome.</b> In all 21 subjects with several different etiologies for the <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome,</b> the mean fractional excretion of free carnitine (33 %) {{as well as}} acyl carnitine (26 %) greatly exceeded normal values (3 and 5 %, respectively). Total free carnitine excretion in <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients correlated with total amino acid excretion (r = 0. 76). Two cystinotic patients fasted for 24 h and one idiopathic <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome</b> patient fasted for 5 h showed normal increases in plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, which suggested that hepatic fatty acid oxidation was intact despite very low plasma free carnitine levels. Muscle biopsies from two cystinotic subjects with <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome</b> and plasma carnitine deficiency had 8. 5 and 13. 1 nmol free carnitine per milligram of noncollagen protein, respectively (normal controls, 22. 3 and 17. 1); total carnitines were 11. 8 and 13. 3 nmol/mg noncollagen protein (controls 33. 5, 20. 0). One biopsy revealed a mild increase in lipid droplets. The other showed mild myopathic features with variation in muscle fiber size, small vacuoles, {{and an increase in}} lipid droplets.

50|$|<b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome,</b> an {{inheritable}} {{disorder in}} which the renal (kidney) tubes fail to reabsorb electrolytes and nutrients, is unusually common in Basenjis. Symptoms include excessive drinking, excessive urination, and glucose in the urine, which {{may lead to a}} misdiagnosis of diabetes. <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome</b> usually presents between 4 and 8 years of age, but sometimes as early as 3 years or as late as 10 years. <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome</b> is treatable and organ damage is reduced if treatment begins early. Basenji owners are advised to test their dog's urine for glucose once a month beginning at the age of 3 years. Glucose testing strips designed for human diabetics are inexpensive and available at most pharmacies.

40|$|Urine {{glyceraldehyde}} excretion is elevated in the renal <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome.</b> We analyzed urinary constituents using GC/MS in 16 {{children with}} the renal <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome</b> and 13 normal individuals. Urine glyceraldehyde levels were strikingly elevated in the renal <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome</b> group (mean 5. 1 ± 4. 8 mg/mg creatinine) compared to levels in the normal group (mean 0. 04 ± 0. 04 mg/mg creatinine, P < 0. 001). Urine lactate levels were also elevated in the renal <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome</b> group (mean 2. 3 ± 2. 6 mg/mg creatinine) compared to normals (mean 0. 01 ± 0. 01 mg/mg creatinine, P < 0. 003). Only small elevations of glyceraldehyde and lactate were found in urine from children with other renal disorders. Serum levels of glyceraldehyde and lactate were no greater in individuals with the <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome</b> than in the normals. The fractional reabsorption of both glyceraldehyde and lactate was virtually complete in the normals, but was markedly impaired in the <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients where, in some cases, glyceraldehyde excretion greatly exceeded the excretion of creatinine. We conclude that marked glyceraldehyde excretion is a previously unrecognized feature of the renal <b>Fanconi</b> <b>syndrome</b> which may result from disordered proximal tubular glycolytic metabolism.
