5|$|An alert {{was issued}} for the Mexican states of Sonora and Sinaloa and Baja California Sur; army and navy units were on standby {{in case of}} an emergency. Roughly 50,000 people {{evacuated}} to storm shelters and thousands of others sought refuge in public buildings, such <b>as</b> <b>schools</b> and churches. Across La Paz, officials evacuated 3,000 families from hurricane-prone areas. In the towns of Altata and Guamúchil alone, army officials evacuated 5,000 coastal residents.|$|E
5|$|Ecclesiastical {{heraldry}} {{refers to}} the use of heraldry within the Christian Church for dioceses and Christian clergy. Initially used to mark documents, ecclesiastical heraldry evolved as a system for identifying people and dioceses. It is most formalized within the Catholic Church, where most bishops, including the Pope, have a personal coat of arms. Clergy in Anglican, Lutheran, Eastern Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches follow similar customs, as do institutions such <b>as</b> <b>schools</b> and dioceses.|$|E

5|$|Before Tropical Storm Danielle {{moved through}} the Lesser Antilles, a small-craft {{advisory}} was issued, and later, gale warnings were posted for Barbados as well as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. On Saint Vincent, {{the threat of the}} storm forced the closure of the main commercial airport, as well <b>as</b> <b>schools,</b> businesses, and stores. Further west, Danielle briefly posed a threat to Jamaica, prompting officials in that country to issue a tropical storm watch. Two months earlier, the precursor to Tropical Storm Andrew killed 49people on the island; to avoid a recurrence, the Jamaican government worked to evacuate fishermen from two small islands as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|Damage {{was also}} heavy on Bimini island, where heavy {{rainfall}} and powerful storm surge damaged homes, trees, and utility poles. On the island, the hurricane severely damaged {{a hotel and}} eight waterfront homes. On Abaco, eight homes and a governmental clinic were destroyed. The storm surge destroyed a government dock and caused flooding and beach erosion near the coast. New Providence and the Berry Islands also reported minor wind damage from Wilma, primarily to downed trees and power lines. Throughout the Bahamas, Wilma damaged public infrastructure such <b>as</b> <b>schools,</b> roads, health clinics, and electrical systems.|$|E
5|$|Hamersley's first school, Glendale Primary School in Glendale Avenue, {{opened in}} 1971 {{in the western}} portion of the suburb. The school and {{neighbouring}} kindergarten quickly became overcrowded as their catchment area initially extended to Hepburn Avenue, taking in Warwick and Greenwood to its north. <b>As</b> <b>schools</b> were built in those suburbs in 1974–1976, congestion eased considerably. The school and kindergarten were also used as a hall and meeting place by residents and groups until the recreation centre opened in April 1975. In 2016, the school provided for 248 primary students between Year 1 and Year 6, and 28 pre-primary students.|$|E

5|$|Like their garage rock predecessors, {{these local}} scenes were {{facilitated}} by enthusiastic impresarios who operated nightclubs or organized concerts in venues such <b>as</b> <b>schools,</b> garages, or warehouses, advertised via inexpensively printed flyers and fanzines. In some cases, punk's {{do it yourself}} ethic reflected an aversion to commercial success, {{as well as a}} desire to maintain creative and financial autonomy. As Joe Harvard, a participant in the Boston scene, describes, it was often a simple necessity—the absence of a local recording industry and well-distributed music magazines left little recourse but DIY.|$|E
5|$|Seattle’s University of Washington {{was greatly}} {{affected}} during the Depression era. <b>As</b> <b>schools</b> across Washington lost funding and attendance, the UW actually prospered {{during the time}} period. While Seattle public schools were influenced by Washington’s superintendent Worth McClure, they still struggled to pay teachers and maintain attendance. The UW, despite academic challenges that plagued the college due to differing views on teaching and learning, focused on growth in student enrollment rather than improving the existing school.|$|E
5|$|The {{refugees}} needed buildings such <b>as</b> <b>schools,</b> hospitals, warehouses, {{places of}} worship were built for them. As part of the second phase, temporary villages were built and by mid-1955, most of the one million refugees were living in rows of temporary housing settlements, mostly near highways leading out of Saigon, in provinces adjacent to the capital. The largest concentration of housing in this second stage was located {{to the north of}} the capital. Only a minority could be sent to the fertile Mekong Delta, as the area was already overcrowded. It was also restive due to the presence of militant religious sects, so the most of the military evacuees were sent there.|$|E

5|$|Early in the Act's {{enforcement}} history, the Supreme Court {{addressed the}} constitutionality of several provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. In Katzenbach v. Morgan (1966), the Court upheld {{the constitutionality of}} Section 4(e). This section prohibits jurisdictions from administering literacy tests to citizens who attain a sixth-grade education in an American school in which the predominant language was Spanish, such <b>as</b> <b>schools</b> in Puerto Rico. Although the Court had earlier held in Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections (1959) that literacy tests did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, in Morgan the Court held that Congress could enforce Fourteenth Amendment rights—such {{as the right to}} vote—by prohibiting conduct it deemed to interfere with such rights, even if that conduct may not be independently unconstitutional. After Congress created a nationwide ban on all literacy tests and similar devices in 1970 by enacting Section 201, the Court upheld the ban as constitutional in Oregon v. Mitchell (1970).|$|E
5|$|Set in {{the grounds}} of Cobdown Park, the Cobdown Sports and Social Club evolved from the former social club for Reeds International, the paper-maker. A new clubhouse was built in 1985 for Reed International Sports and Social Club and in 1989 the club became the Cobdown Sports & Social Club when it {{was taken over by}} the club members. Although it {{remained}} a members club, with many of the same activities, the club was opened up to the general public and new activities were added. Sports form an important part of these activities, and the club is an important local centre {{with a wide range of}} facilities to cater for groups and organisations, such <b>as</b> <b>schools</b> and businesses. Membership is also open to sports teams that wish to use the club. Facilities include a bar, with snooker and pool tables, a darts board, and a big screen for major sporting events. There is a dedicated function room that is used for social and business events and can accommodate a maximum of 100 people seated.|$|E
5|$|There are {{sections}} of the Temple known as Orders, each of which focus on a particular theme, for instance ancient Egypt, Norse culture, Tantric Hinduism, or vampirism. Others focus on a particular skill, for instance the Order of Uart focuses on the visual arts and the Order of Taliesin on music. Orders can be understood <b>as</b> <b>schools</b> of different aspects of magic providing different paths of initiation. Orders are led by grand masters, who will usually be {{the founder of the}} order. In longer-lived orders the founder may have a successive grand master. Orders are founded by members of the fourth degree. When members reaches the second degree of initiation, they are expected to join an order of their own choosing. In normal circumstances, a Setian is only permitted to join one order, however special dispensation can be obtained for a practitioner to join two.|$|E

5|$|Water-power {{was first}} {{introduced}} to England by John Lombe at his silk mill in Derby in 1719, but it was Richard Arkwright who applied water-power {{to the process of}} producing cotton in the 1770s. His patent of a water frame allowed cotton to be spun continuously, meaning it could be produced by unskilled workers. Cromford Mill was the site of Arkwright's first mill, with nearby Cromford village significantly expanded for his then-new workforce; this system of production and workers' housing was copied throughout the valley. To ensure the presence of a labour force, it was necessary to construct housing for the mill workers. Thus, new settlements were established by mill owners around the mills– sometimes developing a pre-existing community– with their own amenities such <b>as</b> <b>schools,</b> chapels, and markets. Most of the housing still exists and is still in use. Along with the transport infrastructure form part of the site. A transport infrastructure was built to open new markets for the mills' produce.|$|E
