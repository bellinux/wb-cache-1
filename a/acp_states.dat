50|$|Five Latin American {{countries}} (Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Venezuela) had forwarded {{a complaint}} against the EU's banana import regime in 1993, stating that it violated fundamental GATT principals. The panel established in the GATT framework confirmed this view, but its report was not adopted, as the required unanimity was prevented by the EU and countries belonging {{to the group of}} <b>ACP</b> <b>states,</b> who were receiving preferential treatment under the EU's importation regime. In the following year negotiations were held, after which four of the five complaining parties concluded the BFA with the EU, which granted them specific shares of the bound tariff quota they were subject to when exporting bananas to the EU.|$|E

50|$|Between {{independence}} in 1966 and the 1990s, Barbados has used a pro business and investment policy {{to expand its}} influence in the world. Through the usage of its network of international bilateral relations, {{the country has been}} able to maintain an independent foreign policy. Barbados' recent policy has been to focus and strengthen ties with nations that country feels will enhance its diplomacy or foreign trade. Barbados has sought to engage in multilateral diplomacy through the United Nations, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), the group of ACP countries, the Organization of American States, and several other agencies which it is engaged. In 2008 Barbados and the other members of CARICOM signed an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union and its European Commission. The deal covers CARICOM's membership in the Caribbean Forum (CARIFORUM). CARIFORUM in turn {{is a part of the}} Group of African, Caribbean, and Pacific (<b>ACP)</b> <b>States.</b> The agreement outlines Barbados' future development and trade ties with the European Union, and serves as a blueprint for future relations between both trading blocs under the Cotonou Agreement and the Lomé Convention.|$|E
40|$|Economic engagements {{between the}} European Union (EU) and some {{developing}} countries within the African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) region have been characterised by exploitative traits {{to the advantage}} of the former. This study argues that internal and external factors have severely hindered the conclusion of EPAs between ESA states and the EU. Internal issues of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPAs) such as contentious issues, lack of funding and new emerging issues {{in the form of the}} Turkey clause have created an unfavorable negotiating atmosphere. External forces manifested in the form of the global financial crisis and the economic rise of non EU member states (China, Brazil and India) have shifted the priority options of both the EU and <b>ACP</b> <b>states.</b> To <b>ACP</b> <b>states,</b> EPAs appear to tighten the neo-colonial wave of the developed EU and also cause regional disintegration among the ACP region. With the use of documentary search and in-depth interviews with key informants, this study established that EPAs have cemented dependency of <b>ACP</b> <b>states</b> on the EU and have not resulted in sustainable economic development. It recommends the need for <b>ACP</b> <b>states</b> to be given enough policy space in the negotiations while new issues need to be shelved until the already contentious issues have been resolved. <b>ACP</b> <b>states</b> should also address internal political issues before committing to multiple economic fronts such as the EPAs...|$|E

This twenty-year partnership agreement with seventy-seven <b>ACP</b> <b>states</b> replaced the Lome Convention, which had provided the structure for trade and cooperation between the <b>ACP</b> <b>states</b> and the EU since 1975. The Cotonou Agreement focuses on poverty reduction as its principal objective, which will be achieved through political dialogue, development aid, and closer economic and trade cooperation. This Note discusses {{the structure of the}} Cotonou Agreement and analyzes the various effects the Agreement will have on the ACP countries, particularly, the countries of the Caribbean. It concludes that, despite its objectives, the Agreement will likely contribute to a decline in the economies of the ACP nations...|$|E
