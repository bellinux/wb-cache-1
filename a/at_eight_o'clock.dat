5|$|The final {{was played}} at the Estadio Centenario on 30 July. Feelings ran high around the La Plata Basin as the Argentine {{supporters}} crossed the river with the war cry Victoria o muerte ("victory or death"), dispelling any uncertainty {{as to whether the}} tournament had captured the imagination of the public. The ten boats earmarked to carry Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo proved inadequate, and any number of assorted craft attempted the crossing. An estimated 10–15,000 Argentinians made the trip, but the port at Montevideo was so overwhelmed that many did not even make landfall before kick-off, let alone reach the stadium. At the stadium, supporters were searched for weapons. The gates were opened <b>at</b> <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock,</b> six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full, the official attendance 93,000. A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as the teams failed to agree on who should provide the match ball, forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second. Uruguay made one change from their semi-final line-up. Castro replaced Anselmo, who missed out due to illness. Monti played for Argentina despite receiving death threats {{on the eve of the}} match. The referee was Belgian John Langenus, who only agreed to officiate a few hours before the game, having sought assurances for his safety. One of his requests was for a boat to be ready at the harbour within one hour of the final whistle, in case he needed to make a quick escape.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 27 August the bomb vessels started bombarding Fort Washington. This caused the {{garrison}} to flee. However, suspecting trickery, Captain Gordon ordered the vessels to continue to fire, only ceasing when the powder magazine exploded <b>at</b> <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock.</b>|$|E

Tesla would telephone his dinner order to the headwaiter, who also could {{be the only one}} to serve him. [...] "The meal was required to be ready <b>at</b> <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock...</b> He dined alone, except on the rare occasions when he would give a dinner to a group to meet his social obligations. Tesla would then resume his work, often until 3:00a.m." ...|$|E

500|$|John Hurt plays Harold [...] "Ox" [...] Oxley, Mutt's {{surrogate}} {{father and}} Indiana's old friend. Frank Darabont had suggested Hurt while writing the screenplay. The character {{is inspired by}} Ben Gunn of Treasure Island. Hurt read the script before agreeing to his role, unlike other cast members who came on [...] "because Steven— you know, 'God'— was doing it. And I said, 'Well, I {{need to have a}} little bit of previous knowledge even if God is doing it.' So they sent a courier over with the script from Los Angeles, gave it to me at three o'clock in the afternoon in London, collected it again <b>at</b> <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the evening, and he returned the next day to Los Angeles." ...|$|E
500|$|Churchill {{described}} his life at Chartwell {{in the later}} 1930s in {{the first volume of}} his history of the Second World War, The Gathering Storm. [...] "I had much to amuse me. I built... two cottages,... and walls and made... a large swimming pool which... could be heated to supplement our fickle sunshine. Thus I... dwelt at peace within my habitation". Bill Deakin, one of Churchill's research assistants, recalled his working routine. [...] "He would start the day <b>at</b> <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock</b> in bed, reading. Then he started with his mail. His lunchtime conversation was quite magnificent,...absolutely free for all. After lunch, if he had guests he would take them round the garden. At seven he would bathe and change for dinner. At midnight, when the guests left, then he would start work... to three or four in the morning. The secret was his phenomenal power to concentrate." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{producing}} Why Don't You?, Davies {{branched out}} within the children's department at BBC Manchester: he attended directors' courses; wrote for older audiences with {{his contributions to}} DEF II and On the Waterfront; and accompanied Keith Chegwin to Norway {{to assist in the}} production of a children's documentary about politics. The head of the children's department, Ed Pugh, offered him the chance to produce Breakfast Serials, a new series scheduled for an 8:00am slot. Breakfast Serials incorporated elements of non-sequitur comedy and popular culture references aimed at older pupils, such as a parody of Land of the Giants. He decided to leave the children's department and the BBC during the production of Breakfast Serials: a friend called him after the first episode was transmitted and observed that he had [...] "broadcast a joke about the juvenilia of Emily Brontë <b>at</b> <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning"; the conversation caused him to reflect that he was writing for the wrong audience. Davies produced three more children's series while he pursued an adult drama career: Dark Season, Century Falls, and Children's Ward.|$|E

500|$|From {{this point}} on, combat {{centered}} on the village of Unterhausen, [...] west-south-west of Neuburg center. A few French platoons drove the Austrians from the forest located between the village and the Danube with a bayonet charge by the grenadiers of the 109th. As French reserves arrived, the Austrians counterattacked and retook the woods, the heights at Oberhausen, and the village. [...] According to Lecourbe's account, the Austrians, [...] "embolden by this first success, soon covered all the surrounding heights, on which they planted about twenty-five or thirty pieces of cannon." [...] <b>At</b> <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock</b> at night, after twelve hours of battle, companies of the 14th and 46th Regiments (French) moved along a small road {{on the right of}} the village, and another group proceeded on the left, enveloping the village. [...] The subsequent simultaneous French attack at both flanks and the center convinced the Austrians that, despite the defensive barrages laid by their artillery in Oberhausen, the French had been massively reinforced. The attack on the village, executed without firing a shot, involved fierce hand-to-hand fighting in which the commander of the 46th Regiment and the First Grenadier of France, Latour D'Auvergne, were both killed.|$|E
500|$|On October 29 <b>at</b> <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, a {{shot was}} {{heard from the}} Dutch flagship. It was the signal to advance and smash the Swedish line. The Dutch fleet was divided into three {{squadron}}s. Vice Admiral Witte de With on the 54-gun ship Brederod and his 11-ship squadron led the charge, followed by Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam on the 72-gun Eendracht with 13 ships in the squadron. The last squadron, led by Pieter Floriszoon had 11 ships. In total, the Dutch fleet consisted of 45 ships with 1,838 cannons and 4,000 sailors. Following the warships, many transports with large quantities of food and supplies as well as 28 regiments of experienced soldiers followed, in total 2 300 men. [...] Standing against them was a Swedish navy force consisting of 43 ships, with 1,605 cannons and 4,055 sailors. The Swedes also had great hopes that the coastal artillery of Kronborg would inflict great damage. Charles personally fired the first hostile shot from Kronborg, but it fell short; the Dutch had wisely chosen to sail closer to the Swedish side, where there were fewer land-based guns to contend with. The Swedish force had more guns, but the Dutch {{had the advantage of}} the wind. In the narrow straits of Øresund, nearly a hundred warships now battled.|$|E
2500|$|<b>At</b> <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock</b> on {{the morning}} of 4 December, some [...] off Cap de Caux, Leda sighted a {{privateer}} lugger making for the French coast, as well as a brig that appeared to be her prize. The brig ran for Havre de Grace but the lugger sailed in another direction as Leda pursued her. After six hours Leda succeeded in capturing the lugger, {{which turned out to be}} the brand new vessel Adolphe, under the command of Nicholas Famenter. Adolphe was armed with ten 18-pound carronades, four 4-pounder guns, two 2-pounder guns and two swivel guns. She was eight days out of Boulogne. She had only 25 men on board as she had already put another 45 men of her crew on prizes.|$|E
60|$|Even the cosy library {{could not}} hold them very late, for none had been fully {{restored}} by the sleep obtained during the day. Bed seemed more alluring than a grate fire and when the Hahns went home the party broke up, to meet again <b>at</b> an <b>eight</b> <b>o’clock</b> breakfast.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no,' replied John, {{colouring}} rather; 'a chair. The idea of {{a stranger}} coming into my rooms <b>at</b> half-past <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, and taking a pudding!

60|$|The {{undertaker}} {{had provided}} a cart {{and a couple}} of oxen and two men to lift the coffin in and out.

2500|$|... "(O'Hare) {{was a great}} swimmer and spear fisherman, and {{he insisted}} that the {{squadron}} swim with him. Swimming with Butch O'Hare meant that <b>at</b> <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, you swam out into the ocean off Maui; he would still be out there {{at three in the}} afternoon! If he got hungry, Butch would roll over and dive, {{and the next thing you}} knew, he would come up with a fish of some sort. Then he'd just roll over and lie on his back like an otter and eat the thing raw! He really impressed us with that! One day, he came back to the surface with an octopus draped over his arm. He said, 'Now, you have to learn how to kill these things, boys: you bite 'em right behind the eye.' And with that, he chomped down! The octopus has some sort of spinal cord there, and biting it there does kill it! Then we had to go back to the beach where Butch would put these things in a frying pan with a little oil and some salt and stir them around. He enjoyed them, but they tasted like old rubber tires to me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|After the {{disastrous}} {{failure of the}} mid-June convoys, it was wondered if Malta could hold out on the meagre supplies rescued from [...] "Harpoon" [...] and [...] "Vigorous" [...] until another convoy could be organised. Escorting merchant ships in the brilliance of a Mediterranean moonlit period was courting inevitable disaster. This situation limited operations {{in the immediate future}} to the moonless period in July or August between the 10th and 16th of those months. July passed as the Ohio could not be fitted-out in time. Once the due planning had been carried out it was decided to begin the operation in August. Ohio steamed down to Dunglass on the Clyde and loaded 11,500 tons of kerosene and diesel fuel oils. She was the only ship carrying these supplies which were so vital to Malta's survival. Before she sailed special strengthening was given to the tanker to protect her against the shock of bombs exploding near her. In the previous convoy, the tanker Kentucky had been sunk with only a few hours' repair work needed on a steam pipe, which had been broken by the force of such explosions. The Ministry was determined that this should not happen again, and so Ohios engines were mounted on rubber bearings, to reduce shock, and all steam pipes were supported with steel springs and baulks of timber. While the merchant ships were gathering in the Clyde Estuary, the naval forces had already reached Scapa Flow. Admiral Syfret joined [...] there on 27 July and held a convoy conference on 2 August; the same day, all leave had been stopped. <b>At</b> <b>eight</b> <b>o'clock</b> that evening, two hours before dusk, the convoy sailed. The fourteen ships, led by [...] formed up, it was dark {{by the time they reached}} the open sea.|$|E
