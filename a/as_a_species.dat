5|$|Cetiosauriscus longus: In 1990, John Stanton McIntosh {{recombined}} Cetiosaurus longus <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>species</b> of Cetiosauriscus. This classification is {{not accepted}} and Cetiosauriscus longus is a junior objective synonym of Cetiosaurus longus because it cannot be proven to possess any characteristic autapomorphies of Cetiosauriscus. In 1993, Charig found the species to be a nomen dubium.|$|E
5|$|I. major, {{a species}} named by Justin Delair in 1966, based on {{vertebrae}} from the Isle of Wight and Sussex originally described by Owen in 1842 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>species</b> of Streptospondylus, S. major, is a nomen dubium.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, the Glover's pika {{is rated}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>species</b> ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This {{is because it}} is a {{widespread}} species, and it occurs in remote areas of China which are unlikely to be affected by human activities. The current state of its population trend is unclear, as no natural historic or ecological investigation has been done on this species. However, being locally poisoned and trapped is a major threat to the Glover's pika populations. It is also regionally red listed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>species</b> of least concern in China.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} may be hunted by birds of prey, infested by parasites such as fleas, or {{act as an}} {{involuntary}} host to the common cuckoo, but overall its population is large and stable, and it is therefore evaluated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>species</b> of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|The first fossils named Edmontosaurus were {{discovered}} in southern Alberta (named after Edmonton, the capital city), in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (formerly called the lower Edmonton Formation). The type species, E. regalis, was named by Lawrence Lambe in 1917, although several other species that are now classified in Edmontosaurus were named earlier. The best known of these is E. annectens, named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1892; originally <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>species</b> of Claosaurus, known for many years <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>species</b> of Trachodon, and later as Anatosaurus annectens. Anatosaurus and Anatotitan are now generally regarded as synonyms of Edmontosaurus.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of {{subspecies}} have been named, of which 12 were recognised in the Handbook of the Birds of the World. These subspecies are divided into two groups, the Palaearctic P. d. domesticus group, and the Oriental P. d. indicus group. Several Middle Eastern subspecies, including P. d. biblicus, are sometimes considered a third, intermediate group. The subspecies P. d. indicus was described <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>species,</b> and {{was considered to be}} distinct by many ornithologists during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{studies of}} morphology, the bluebuck has {{historically}} been classified as either a distinct species or as a subspecies of the roan antelope. After its extinction, some 19th-century naturalists began to doubt its validity <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>species,</b> with some believing the museum specimens to be small or immature roan antelopes, and both species were lumped together under the name A.leucophaeus by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1821. The Austrian zoologist Franz Friedrich Kohl pointed out the distinct features of the bluebuck in 1866, followed by Sclater and Thomas, who rejected the synonymy in 1899.|$|E
5|$|Breeding over a huge area, the Siberian accentor has a {{large and}} {{apparently}} stable population. It is therefore evaluated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>species</b> of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although, as a northern breeding species, it may be affected by climate change in the long term. October and November 2016 saw an unprecedented influx of this species into western Europe, reaching {{as far as the}} United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Common ravens have coexisted {{with humans}} for {{thousands}} of years and in some areas have been so numerous that people have regarded them as pests. Part of their success <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>species</b> is due to their omnivorous diet; they are extremely versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on carrion, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, and food waste.|$|E
5|$|Drosera anglica {{was first}} {{described}} by William Hudson in 1778. It has frequently been {{confused with the}} other circumpolar long-leaf Drosera, D. intermedia. This confusion was fueled by the resurfacing of an older name, D. longifolia (described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753), which was regarded as being too ambiguous in description and had been applied to specimens of both D. anglica and D. intermedia. Herbarium specimens were also a mix of the two species. These points led Martin Cheek to propose D. longifolia for rejection <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>species</b> name in 1998. The proposal was accepted and the taxon listed as rejected in 1999.|$|E
50|$|The Cape Verde shearwater was {{originally}} described in 1883 by Émile Oustalet <b>as</b> <b>a</b> full <b>species.</b> It was later lumped <b>as</b> <b>a</b> subspecies of Cory's shearwater but {{has since been}} separated again, by Cornelis Hazevoet in 1995, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> distinct <b>species.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{species was}} {{formerly}} treated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> subspecies of the great-winged petrel (Pterodroma macroptera) {{but has been}} recognized <b>as</b> <b>a</b> separate <b>species</b> since 2014.

5|$|Edmontosaurus {{has had a}} {{long and}} {{complicated}} history in paleontology, having spent decades with various species classified in other genera. Its taxonomic history intertwines at various points with the genera Agathaumas, Anatosaurus, Anatotitan, Claosaurus, Hadrosaurus, Thespesius, and Trachodon, and references predating the 1980s typically use Anatosaurus, Claosaurus, Thespesius, or Trachodon for edmontosaur fossils (excluding those assigned to E. regalis), depending on author and date. Although Edmontosaurus was only named in 1917, its oldest well-supported species (E. annectens) was named in 1892 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>species</b> of Claosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of the {{breeding}} {{population of the}} Eurasian rock pipit vary, but may {{be as high as}} 408,000 pairs, of which around 300,000 pairs are in Norway. Despite slight declines in the British population and some range expansion in Finland, the population is considered overall to be large and stable, and for this reason it is evaluated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>species</b> of least concern by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|Glover's pika (Ochotona gloveri) is {{a species}} of mammal in the family Ochotonidae. It was first {{described}} in 1922, by Michael Rogers Oldfield Thomas. The summer dorsal pelage is grayish rufous, grayish brown, or tea brown in colour. The winter pelage {{is similar to the}} summer pelage, but is lighter in tone. Endemic to China, it is found in high altitudes of northeastern Tibet, southwestern Qinghai, western Sichuan, and northwestern Yunnan. It is a generalist herbivore, and is known to construct haypiles. It is rated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>species</b> ofleast concernby theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature.
