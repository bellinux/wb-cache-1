5000|$|The {{feathers}} of the cuckoos are generally soft, and often become waterlogged in heavy rain. Cuckoos often sun themselves after rain, and the anis hold their wings {{open in the}} manner of a vulture or cormorant while drying. There is considerable variation in the plumage exhibited by the family. Some species, particularly the brood parasites have cryptic plumage, whereas others have bright and elaborate plumage. This is particularly true of the Chrysococcyx or glossy cuckoos, which have iridescent plumage. Some cuckoos have a resemblance to hawks in the genus Accipiter with barring on the underside; this apparently alarms potential hosts, allowing the female to access a host nest. The young of some brood parasites are coloured so as to resemble the young of the host. For example, the <b>Asian</b> <b>koels</b> breeding in India have black offspring to resemble their crow hosts, whereas in the Australian koels the chicks are brown like the honeyeater hosts. Sexual dimorphism in plumage is uncommon in the cuckoos, being most common in the parasitic Old World species.|$|R
25|$|The {{breeding}} season is mainly March–April in northern India and earlier in south India. In Sri Lanka {{it is from}} May to July. The nest is a platform of twigs placed in a large tree and very rarely on buildings. The centre of the nest is neatly lined with hair, coir or other fine fibre. The usual clutch is three to five pale blue-green eggs speckled with brown. The eggs hatch after about 17–19 days and the young fledge in about a month. The nests are sometimes parasitized by the <b>Asian</b> <b>koel</b> although not as frequently as the house crow.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>koel</b> was {{originally}} described by Linnaeus as Cuculus scolopaceus {{based on a}} specimen he received from the Malabar region. The species has variations within its wide range with several island populations {{and a number of}} taxonomic variations have been suggested.

50|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>koel</b> (Eudynamys scolopaceus) is {{a member}} of the cuckoo order of birds, the Cuculiformes. It is found in the Indian Subcontinent, China, and Southeast Asia. It forms a {{superspecies}} with the closely related black-billed and Pacific koels which are sometimes treated as subspecies. The <b>Asian</b> <b>koel</b> is a brood parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of crows and other hosts, who raise its young. They are unusual among the cuckoos in being largely frugivorous as adults. The name koel is echoic in origin with several language variants. The bird is a widely used symbol in Indian poetry.|$|E
50|$|Fruit is born in {{clusters}} of 10-20, initially green but turning purple or black when ripe. These are loved by birds {{such as the}} <b>Asian</b> <b>koel</b> Eudynamys scolopaceus and bats including flying foxes.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>koel</b> is a brood parasite, {{and lays}} its single egg in the nests {{of a variety}} of birds, {{including}} the jungle crow, and house crow. In Sri Lanka before 1880 it was only known to parasitize the jungle crow, later shifting to the house crow. A study in India found 5% of Corvus splendens and 0.5% of Corvus macrorhynchos nests parasitized.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>koel</b> is a bird {{of light}} {{woodland}} and cultivation. It is a mainly resident breeder in tropical southern Asia from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to south China and the Greater Sundas.

They first arrived in Singapore in the 1980s and became very common birds.|$|E
50|$|The normal clutch size is 4-6 eggs. The {{average size}} of the egg is 30.8 x 21.99 mm. The {{incubation}} period is 17 to 18 days and fledging period is 22 to 24 days. The <b>Asian</b> <b>koel</b> is sometimes brood parasitic on this species. Nesting material used by mynas include twigs, roots, tow and rubbish.

50|$|Lories and Lorikeets live in Indonesia, New Guinea, Australia and the Pacific. The red lory in {{particular}} is endemic to the Moluccas and surrounding islands in Indonesia. Its natural habitats are tropical moist lowland forests and tropical mangrove forests.It also was introduced to Maldives and released by hotel owners to enrich poor local terrestrial avifauna (which includes only few common Indian land birds such as common myna, <b>Asian</b> <b>koel</b> and House crow) and began to establish there.|$|E
50|$|The normal clutch {{consists}} {{of four or five}} eggs, and rarely six or seven. The egg is a broad oval, rather pointed at the smaller end.

50|$|The {{breeding}} season is in {{summer in the}} temperate ranges. The nest is a deep and loose cup made up of thorny twigs, rags and hair. This is placed in a thorny bush, trees such as Flacourtia and wild date palms (Phoenix). The usual clutch is about 3 to 6 eggs which are incubated by both sexes. The eggs hatch after about 13 to 16 days. Young chicks are often fed with pieces of small birds captured by the parents. A second brood may be raised in the same nest. They are sometimes parasitized by cuckoos such as the common cuckoo (Dehra Dun), common hawk-cuckoo, Jacobin cuckoo and the <b>Asian</b> <b>koel</b> in Bangladesh.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>koel</b> is omnivorous, {{consuming}} {{a variety}} of insects, caterpillars, eggs and small vertebrates. Adults feed mainly on fruit. They will sometimes defend fruiting trees that they forage in and chase away other frugivores. They have been noted to be especially important in the dispersal of the sandalwood tree (Santalum album) in India. Large seeded fruits are sometimes quickly regurgitated near the parent tree while small seeded fruits are ingested {{and are likely to}} be deposited at greater distances from the parent tree. They have a large gape and are capable of swallowing large fruits including the hard fruit of palms such as Arenga and Livistona. They have been known to occasionally take eggs of small birds.|$|E
50|$|Three {{types of}} migratory birds are regular {{visitors}} to Punjab’s provincial metropolis. These are winter visitors, summer visitors and transit migrants. The winter visitors come in September and stay until May. They come from northern latitudes and higher altitudes and include yellow-browed warbler, common starling, white wagtail, yellow wagtail and white-browed wagtail {{in search of}} food. The wagtails eat small insects, spiders, mollusks and soft seeds from moist soil. They roost in tall Typha and reed growth {{on the banks of}} ponds and lakes. Summer visitors arrive from southern parts of the country; these include <b>Asian</b> <b>koel,</b> purple sunbird, golden oriole and cuckoos. They also come here in search of food and for breeding. They stay in urban Lahore from March until September.|$|E
50|$|Sanoor, {{being in}} the Sahyadri hill range, is a home for several {{hundreds}} of birds, many reptiles and mammal species. As there are only small scale food related industries, the area is unpolluted. The commonest among the birds are common crows, pipits and partridges. Other birds such as Kingfisher, Pipt, <b>Asian</b> <b>Koel,</b> Parakeet, Black kite, Falcon, Brahmini kite, Treepie, Black woodpecker, whistling thrush, Rock pigeon, Eagle etc. are seen almost wherever and whenever you pass by. One can see Rufous babblers foraging in noisy groups. As there is totally {{a lack of interest}} in preserving tree, one can see even the Peacocks in the village. Earlier, peacocks were only heard from distance but not seen. During summer, the migratory birds visit the village and causes too much of noise, especially in the evening.|$|E
