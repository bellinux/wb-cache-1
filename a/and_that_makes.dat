For ploughs with two or more furrows more than two horses are needed and, usually, one or more horses have to walk on the loose ploughed sod– <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> hard going for them, and the horse treads the newly ploughed land down. It is usual to rest such horses every half-hour for about ten minutes.|$|E

GameSpot, which awarded Ocarina of Time a 10/10, gave Majora's Mask an 8.3/10, writing that some might [...] "find the focus on minigames and side quests tedious and slightly out of place."

For Camp, [...] "Mixing Beyoncé is a pleasure because she's a real singer and makes it easy. There is hardly an overdub on this project — it's 95 percent live Beyoncé." [...] He further talked about the collaboration with Beyoncé with Mix magazine, saying: [...] "In my 22 years of mixing, I've never come across anyone who could deliver like she does: vocally and her ability to do a show.

500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} critical. John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode 5 out of 10 and wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode {{is an odd}} {{divergence}} from the normal series format, prompted by the production schedule for the feature film. [...] Acceptable as a stand-alone episode, it simply doesn’t fit within the overall scope of the series, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> it hard to judge objectively." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. She noted that the episode, much like the earlier season five entry [...] "Unusual Suspects" [...] was [...] "filler", but that, unlike the earlier episode, [...] "Travelers" [...] was [...] "not particularly entertaining." [...] Vitaris criticized the character of Arthur Dales and wrote that he was [...] "not an intriguing character". However, she did praise the visuals, describing them as [...] "outstanding".|$|E

500|$|A {{controversy}} arose {{over the}} writing credits on [...] "Irreplaceable". Ne-Yo told MTV: [...] "Apparently Beyoncé {{was at a}} show somewhere and right before the song came on she said, 'I wrote this for all my ladies' and then the song came on...The song is a co-write. I wrote the lyrics, I wrote all the lyrics. Beyoncé helped me with the melodies and the harmonies and the vocal arrangement <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> it a co-write. Meaning my contribution and her contribution made that song what it is." [...] In 2011, Ne-Yo said that he wrote the song for himself, but {{thought that it would}} be better suited for Beyoncé, and later regretted giving the song to her. Some of Beyoncé's fans read Ne-Yo's remark as disrespectful towards her. However, he clarified his comment later through Twitter, writing, [...] "I said I originally wrote the song for me....Once I realized how the song comes across if sung by a guy, that's when I decided to give it away." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite briefly {{considering}} [...] "Easy Target" [...] to {{be released}} as the album's third single, [...] "Down" [...] was released instead. The video for [...] "Down", which features real-life ex-gang members, made its television premiere in June 2004. The single was a mixed success, peaking at number 10 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart {{during the week of}} July 31, 2004, but quickly falling off afterward. [...] "Always" [...] was announced as the fourth and final single from Blink-182 in August 2004. [...] "It's gonna change people's lives and might actually change the world forever", DeLonge jokingly predicted. After deciding on the video concept, the clip was recorded and released in November 2004 and continued success all the way into January 2005. A fifth single from the album ("All of This") was discussed; however, plans were dropped following the band's declaration of an 'indefinite hiatus' in February 2005. In response to the idea of [...] "All of This" [...] becoming a possible single, DeLonge joked [...] "We would love it because it's a bad-ass song, and The Cure's Robert Smith sings on it, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> us cooler than everybody else." ...|$|E

Despite her success, Streep has always been modest about her own acting and achievements in cinema. She has stated that she has no particular method when it comes to acting, learning from the days of her early studies that she cannot articulate her practice. She said in 1987, [...] "I have a smattering of things I've learned from different teachers, but nothing I can put into a valise and open it up and say, 'Now which one would you like?' Nothing I can count on <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> it more dangerous. But then the danger makes it more exciting." [...] She has stated that her ideal director is one who gives her complete artistic control, and allowing her a degree of improvisation and to learn from her own mistakes.|$|E

500|$|On 14 May, with Estádio da Luz nearly sold-out, Benfica {{received}} Sporting for a title-deciding Lisbon Derby. The high-pressure {{match was}} unlocked in the 83rd minute when Luisão jumped higher than Ricardo and {{headed in the}} winning goal. Trapattoni tried to calm excess confidence by saying Benfica still had not won the league title. Two days after the game, in an interview to Italian sports daily Gazzetta dello Sport, Trapattoni announced his intention to leave Benfica {{at the end of}} the season and return to Italy. On 22 May, Benfica visited the Estádio do Bessa to face Boavista, needing just one point to win the title. Benfica scored the opening goal with a penalty from Simão. Boavista equalized minutes later but the score remained drawn, ensuring the title for Benfica, their first in ten years and 31st overall. Trapattoni said, [...] "Winning is always hard. This title was amazing and one of the most important of my career. It was won in a new culture for me <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> it even better." [...] In the last game of the season, the 2005 Taça de Portugal Final, Benfica's Simão opened the scoring but allowed Vitória de Setúbal to score twice, losing Benfica their ninth tournament final. The loss also prevented a double for Benfica; it would have been their first since 1987. Two days after the defeat, Trapattoni confirmed he was leaving Benfica for personal reasons, ending his one-year tenure in Portugal.|$|E
500|$|On 18 February 1972 {{the state}} formed the Bangladesh Women's Rehabilitation Board, which was tasked with helping {{the victims of}} rape and {{to help with the}} {{adoption}} programme. Several international agencies took part in the adoption programme, such as Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity. The majority of the war babies were adopted in the Netherlands and Canada as the state wished to remove the reminders of Pakistan from the newly formed nation. However, not all women wanted their child taken, and some were forcibly removed and sent for adoption, a practice which was encouraged by Rahman, who said, [...] "I do not want those polluted blood in this country". While many women were glad for the abortion programme, as {{they did not have to}} bear a child conceived of rape, others had to go full term, filled with hatred towards the child they carried. Others, who had their children adopted out so as to return to [...] "mainstream life", would not look at their newborn as it was taken from them. In the 1990s many of these children returned to Bangladesh to search for their birth mothers. In 2008, D'Costa attempted to find those who had been adopted, however very few responded, one who did said [...] "I hated being a kid, and I am angry at Bangladesh for not taking care of me when I needed it most. I don’t have any roots <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> me cry. So that is why I am trying to learn more about where I was born." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} season, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Tyrion {{is just about}} the only {{character}} developing any complexity. Maybe even a glimmer of a conscience." [...] Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker noted, [...] "If the show has a hero, it's Tyrion (Dinklage), who is capable of cruelty but also possesses insight and empathy, concealed beneath a carapace of Wildean wit." [...] The Hollywood Reporter called Tyrion [...] "the one to watch, as he's the smartest Lannister and knows that having a brat for a king – who mistreats all those around him – could cause major backlash." [...] Willa Paskin of Salon called the character's increased prominence in Season 2 [...] "a trade up in entertainment value, and a trade-off in morality." [...] She added, [...] "Tyrion is more cynical, more manipulative and much better suited to surviving. He's not so keen to be made into meat, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> him the kind of man characters in the show and audience members alike should be investing in." [...] Praising Dinklage, Dan Kois of The New York Times wrote, [...] "He plays Tyrion as the only modern man in a muddy, violent, primal world. He loves good food, good conversation and a good book. Unlike the warmongering lords and knights of Westeros, but like most HBO subscribers, he would prefer to stay out of battle." [...] Kois adds that, [...] "Dinklage's bravado masks Tyrion's deep well of melancholy." [...] Of the Season 2 storyline, Dinklage noted that Tyrion enjoys not only his foray into battle, but also his new and unprecedented power at court. He said, [...] "This is a character that's been shit upon his whole life. I mean, he comes from great wealth, but he's treated very poorly, so now there's a newfound respect where if somebody calls him a name, he can have them killed. He never had that before. Tyrion definitely enjoys that part and he's trying desperately to hold onto it. He's enjoying it while it lasts 'cause he's not sure it's gonna last very long." [...] As Varys the Spymaster tells Tyrion, power is [...] "a trick, a shadow on the wall ... and a very small man can cast a very large shadow." ...|$|E
