40|$|Recent theorizing and {{research}} {{has attempted to}} explicate the functions of moods and emotions within small groups. In this paper, we examine these areas and suggest that <b>affect</b> <b>in</b> groups, as well as specific mechanisms to regulate and maintain certain affective states in groups, have had important roles in promoting group survival over evolutionary history. Specifically, we suggest that <b>affect</b> <b>in</b> groups serves a coordination function, which can take one of two forms. First, <b>affect</b> <b>in</b> groups quickly provides information about the environment and group structure to other group members, thus coordinating group activity via a communication function. Second, shared <b>affect</b> <b>in</b> groups coordinates group activity through fostering group bonds and group loyalty. These two functions of <b>affect</b> <b>in</b> groups are closely related and mutually reinforcing. Current research and {{directions for future research}} within an evolutionary perspective are also discussed...|$|R

Misprocessing of APP results in the accumulation of soluble Aβ that, according to Rowan's hypothesis, impairs hippocampal LTP and {{may lead to the}} cognitive decline seen early in AD.|$|E

40|$|Although {{research}} has demonstrated a strong linkage between meaning of life and positive emotion, {{few studies have examined}} this association in the context of acculturation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the predictive effects of meaning of life and acculturative stressor on positive <b>affect</b> <b>in</b> a sample of Chinese international students in Australia and Hong Kong, and to compare these effects between the two groups. Four hundred mainland Chinese postgraduate students at six universities in Hong Kong and 227 Chinese international students at the University of Melbourne in Australia completed a questionnaire that included measures of acculturative stressor, meaning of life, positive affect, and demographic information. The analyses revealed that (1) meaning of life had a strong positive contribution to predict positive <b>affect</b> <b>in</b> acculturation, and acculturative stress had a negative impact on positive affect within both samples; (2) social interaction had a significant negative predictive effect on positive <b>affect</b> <b>in</b> both samples, and academic work served as a significant negative predictor of positive <b>affect</b> <b>in</b> the Hong Kong sample; and (3) meaning of life was found to mediate the relationship between acculturative stress and positive <b>affect</b> <b>in</b> both samples.

In order to achieve this, {{a series of studies}} was conducted that supported the development and test of a comprehensive, chained mediation model of academic performance. The proposed chained mediation model comprised of adaptive-positive and maladaptive-negative submodels. The adaptive-positive submodel hypothesised firstly that trait intrinsic motivation and adaptive metacognition would facilitate the use of creative cognition in studying (first-level mediator). Secondly, the model hypothesised that the use of creative cognition in studying would lead to the experience of positive <b>affect</b> <b>in</b> studying, and {{to the development of a}}daptive approaches to studying (second-level mediators). Finally, the submodel hypothesised that positive <b>affect</b> <b>in</b> studying and adaptive approaches to studying would facilitate academic performance. The maladaptive-negative submodel hypothesised firstly that trait extrinsic motivation and maladaptive metacognition would lead to evaluation anxiety (first-level mediator). Secondly, the model hypothesised that evaluation anxiety would lead to the experience of negative <b>affect</b> <b>in</b> studying, and to the development of a maladaptive approach to studying (second-level mediators). Finally, the submodel hypothesised that negative <b>affect</b> <b>in</b> studying and the maladaptive approach to studying would undermine academic performance.
