5|$|Late that day, {{mountain}} pioneers destroyed some isolated Yugoslav bunkers in {{the area}} penetrated by Kampfgruppe Palten, and German aircraft again attacked the 7th Army's air reconnaissance assets {{on the ground at}} Cerklje, destroying most of them at the second attempt. This was followed by Italian <b>air</b> <b>attacks</b> on 7th Army troop concentrations. The VVKJ was unable to interdict the Axis <b>air</b> <b>attacks</b> because their fighters were based too far away. After having been grounded {{for most of the day}} by poor weather, in the afternoon, Yugoslav bombers flew missions against airfields and railway stations across the Reich frontier. By the close of 6 April, the 7th Army was still largely mobilising and concentrating, and fifth column actions meant that nearly all the fighting was conducted by border troops. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was deployed along the southern bank of the Drava around Ptuj and Maribor, and a reinforced infantry regiment was approaching Dravograd from the west. German and Italian <b>air</b> <b>attacks</b> interfered with the deployment of troops and command was hampered by reliance on civilian telegraph and telephone services. LI Infantry Corps had occupied Gornja Radgona, Murska Sobota and Radenci, and had crossed the Drava near Sveti Duh. XLIX Mountain Corps captured border crossings on the approaches to Dravograd, but were held up by border troops in mountain passes located further west.|$|E
5|$|Malta Story (1953), {{starring}} Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Steel and Muriel Pavlow, is a {{black and}} white war film telling the story of the defence of Malta in 1942 when Spitfires were the island's main defence from <b>air</b> <b>attacks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Much of Japan's {{industrial}} capacity was also destroyed by Allied bombing. Over 600 major industrial facilities were destroyed or badly damaged, {{contributing to a}} large decline in production. Absenteeism caused by the <b>air</b> <b>attacks</b> further reduced output. It {{is not possible to}} determine the exact damage bombing caused to Japan's economy, however, as the Allied naval blockade also contributed to general breakdown which occurred from late 1944. Statistics compiled by the USSBS show a correlation between the number of B-29 sorties directed at different industries and the amount by which their production declined, but <b>air</b> <b>attacks</b> were not the only reason for these differences. In addition to the heavy bomber attacks, the operations by Allied aircraft carriers tightened the blockade by disrupting Japanese coastal shipping; the naval aircraft were unable to carry enough bombs to seriously damage Japanese industrial plants, however. Compounding the effects of the <b>air</b> <b>attacks,</b> Japan's rice crop of 1945 failed. The resulting shortage of rice caused widespread malnutrition, and mass starvation would have occurred had the war continued. In financial terms, the Allied air campaign and attacks on merchant ships destroyed between one third and a quarter of Japan's wealth.|$|E

5|$|While it {{was planned}} to refuel the fleet's destroyers on 10 January, this was {{frustrated}} by bad weather. Instead, the destroyers were refueled during 11 January as the fleet proceeded south-west. Once the destroyers were refueled, the Third Fleet was reorganized for combat. Two heavy cruisers and five destroyers were transferred from Task Group 38.1 to Task Group 38.2. The later task group, {{under the command}} of Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan, was intended to launch <b>air</b> <b>attacks</b> against Cam Ranh Bay from its three large carriers and single light carrier on the morning of 12 January. The Task Group's two battleships, accompanied by destroyers and cruisers, would then bombard the area and finish off ships which were damaged in the <b>air</b> <b>attacks.</b> The fleet remained undetected by Japanese forces on 10 and 11 January.|$|E
5|$|As the Second Assault Unit {{approached}} Guadalcanal through Indispensable Strait, it {{was attacked}} by five CAF SBD-3 Dauntless dive bombers. Bomb hits caused heavy damage to Yura, and the unit reversed course to try to escape. More CAF <b>air</b> <b>attacks</b> on Yura throughout the day caused further damage, and the cruiser was abandoned and scuttled at 21:00 that night.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the KPA 1st Division crossed the river on barges between Hamch'ang and Sangju, in the ROK 6th Division's sector from 6 to 8 August. This attack was {{discovered}} quickly by American reconnaissance planes and the KPA 1st Division was immediately engaged by the ROK forces. The two divisions locked in battle around Kunwi until 17 August, with the KPA division facing stubborn resistance, heavy <b>air</b> <b>attacks,</b> and heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|During the Channel Dash the Luftwaffe {{succeeded in}} {{defeating}} <b>air</b> <b>attacks</b> on the German ships during the operation, thus {{allowing them to}} reach German waters. In the air battles that took place over the Channel the British suffered heavy losses for a non-existent return. German losses were modest, and the operation achieved its objective.|$|E
5|$|Further <b>air</b> <b>attacks</b> were {{conducted}} on 15 June. During the afternoon, two groups of Avengers attacked a floating dry dock and several oil tanks. That night six Avengers armed with bombs supported by two flare-dropping Avengers conducted the final British attack on Truk, but {{it is believed that}} most of their bombs landed in the sea. This was the BPF's first large-scale night operation.|$|E

50|$|In 1969, Israel {{became aware}} that Egypt was using an {{advanced}} Soviet radar. Originally, an <b>air</b> <b>attack</b> was planned to destroy it. The <b>air</b> <b>attack</b> was cancelled, however, and the mission assigned to helicopter-carried Sayeret Matkal special operations troops, who believed they could capture the radar, and return at least significant pieces.|$|R
5|$|German close {{air support}} also began to take its toll, forcing units such as the Soviet 38th Army onto the defensive. It ranged over the front, {{operating}} dangerously close to the changing frontline. Air interdiction and direct ground support damaged Soviet supply lines and rear areas, also inflicting large losses on their armoured formations. General Franz Halder remarked the <b>air</b> <b>attacks</b> {{went a long way}} to breaking the Soviet offensive. The Soviet air force could do very little to stop these <b>air</b> <b>attacks.</b> Not only did the Luftwaffe attack the enemy, it also carried out vital supply missions. Bombers dropped supplies to encircled German units, which could continue to hold out until a counter-offensive relieved them. Over the course of the 16-day battle the German 6th Air Corps {{played a major role in}} the German victory, conducting 15,648 sorties (978 per day), dropping 7,700 tons of bombs on the Soviet forces and lifting 1,545 tons of material to the front.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{wanted to}} {{maintain}} the threat of invasion by continuing <b>air</b> <b>attacks</b> on military targets in the British capital. Hans Jeschonnek still pushed for attacks on civilian morale. He argued that military and civilian industries were located too far apart to achieve a collapse of morale by attacking the former. Instead, he pressed for attacks against residential areas. Hitler refused. He ordered that only military targets in London were to be attacked.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the destroyers Arashio (bombed; 35) and Asashio (strafed by aircraft; 21) {{were both}} damaged during the <b>air</b> <b>attacks</b> which sank Mikuma and caused further damage to Mogami.

5|$|The battle {{consisted}} of American air raids against Japanese military installations on Formosa (Taiwan) {{during the day}} and Japanese <b>air</b> <b>attacks</b> at night against American ships. Japanese losses exceeded 300 planes destroyed in the air, while American losses amounted to fewer than 100 aircraft destroyed and two cruisers damaged. This outcome effectively deprived the Japanese Navy's Combined Fleet of air cover for future operations, which proved decisive during the Battle of Leyte Gulf later in October.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarine}} {{pens and}} other Atlantic Wall fortifications {{had been built}} in 1940 and 1941, when the Germans had air superiority and could deter Allied <b>air</b> <b>attacks.</b> By 1942 this advantage had been lost to the United States Army Air Forces, which had begun deploying to England in May 1942, and a greatly expanded Royal Air Force. The German Army preferred an alternative approach which would use trailer-style mobile launch platforms called Meillerwagen accompanied by testing and fuelling equipment mounted on railway cars or trucks. Although this configuration was far less efficient and would have a much lower rate of fire, it would have the great advantage of presenting a much smaller target for the Allied air forces. The Army was not convinced that fixed bunkers could resist repeated <b>air</b> <b>attacks</b> and was particularly concerned about {{the vulnerability of the}} launch sites' road and rail links, which were essential for resupplying them with missiles and fuel.|$|E
