At a party, while Nana mingles with several men, Nunung sits out every dance and {{eventually}} leaves with Herman. <b>Asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> has returned home, Nunung tells her grandmother that she felt too old among the younger party-goers and asks why she was told to go. Nenny, again eavesdropping, shouts out that their grandmother is hoping to find her a husband. Though Nunung is initially angered, she understands her grandmother's good intentions.|$|E
5|$|Matsueda {{is noted}} for her jazzy style, which she often {{incorporated}} into the soundtracks she worked on; she also touched on genres like jazz fusion, lounge, and ambient. For the scores that she collaborated on with Eguchi, she was {{responsible for most of}} the jazzy tracks, while Eguchi provided the majority of the electronic music. Matsueda has said that the best qualities of a composer are their curiosity and sensitivity, and that watching many things, listening, touching, and feeling are important factors in composition.

Meanwhile, Lucan's children were taken by their aunt, Lady Sarah Gibbs, to her home in Guilsborough, Northamptonshire, where they would remain for several weeks. On the day Veronica Lucan was discharged from hospital, a High Court hearing confirmed that the children could return to live with her.

25|$|The Bureau’s {{creation}} became controversial on Capitol Hill. In December 1920, a U.S. House appropriations subcommittee questioned Van Winkle and District Commissioner Charles W. Kutz. Subcommittee members Rep. George Tinkham (a Republican from Massachusetts) (and Rep. Thomas U. Sisson, a Democrat from Mississippi) objected that Congress had {{not specifically}} appropriated {{funds for a}} bureau of policewomen. Colonel Kutz responded that Congress had specifically appropriated funds for police officers, and “there {{is nothing in the}} law that requires that policemen shall be of the male sex.” During the hearing, Tinkham, an opponent of women’s suffrage, asked Van Winkle dozens of questions. When <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> was doing this work, she replied, “because I have nothing else to do; it is my job in life.” Ultimately, the Subcommittee did not withhold the Bureau’s appropriation.|$|E

500|$|Minnie began {{painting}} in late 1999 or 2000, {{when she was}} almost 80.

By the 2000s, she was reported as living at Alparra, the largest of Utopia's communities, or at Urultja (also Irrultja, again in the Sandover region). Sprightly and outgoing, even in her eighties she could outrun younger women chasing goannas for bushfood, and she continued to create art works until two days before her death on 18 March 2006. She was outlived by all her sisters except Maggie Pwerle, mother of artists Gloria and Kathleen Petyarre (or Pitjara).|$|E

While she was en route, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated, and the day before she arrived, Britain declared war on Germany. The United States was still neutral, however, so Hogg continued her tour of Europe, not leaving until several months later.|$|E
500|$|Despite being a {{critical}} and commercial failure, Tank Girl {{is often said}} to have a cult following. Petty's version of Tank Girl remains a popular character at cosplay events. The music video for Avril Lavigne's 2013 song [...] "Rock n Roll" [...] was heavily influenced by Tank Girl. During her interview included on the Blu-ray release of the film in 2013, Petty was <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> thinks the film still resonates with fans, and replied: [...] "There's no formula as to why Tank Girl was so fabulous and why people love it so much... It was unique, it was new, it was fresh, it was way ahead of its time, and I'm happy that I {{got to do it}} and that I'll always have her." [...] Luke Buckmaster from the BBC included the film in his 2015 list of the [...] "ten weirdest superhero films", asserting that: [...] "at its best, director Rachel Talalay captures an ostentatious steampunk vibe that proves weirdly addictive." ...|$|E
500|$|Hepburn stayed active {{throughout}} the 1970s, focusing on roles described by Andrew Britton as [...] "either a devouring mother or a batty old lady living [...] ". First she traveled to Spain to film {{a version of}} Euripides' The Trojan Women (1971) alongside Vanessa Redgrave. When <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> had taken the role, she responded {{that she wanted to}} broaden her range and try everything while she still had time. The movie was poorly received, but the Kansas City Film Critics Circle named Hepburn's performance the best from an actress that year. In 1971 she signed on to star in an adaptation of Graham Greene's Travels with My Aunt, but was unhappy with early versions of the script and took to rewriting it herself. The studio disliked her changes, so Hepburn abandoned the project and was replaced with Maggie Smith. Her next film, an adaptation of Edward Albee's A Delicate Balance (1973) directed by Tony Richardson, had a small release and received generally unfavorable reviews.|$|E

500|$|Quintanilla, Jr. held {{a meeting}} on March 9, 1995, with Selena and Suzette Quintanilla at Q-Productions to confront Saldívar. Quintanilla, Jr. {{presented}} Saldívar with evidence concerning the missing funds. He said Saldívar simply stared at him without answering any of his questions. Quintanilla, Jr. told Saldívar he would involve police {{if she did not}} produce evidence that disproved his accusations. When Quintanilla, Jr. asked her why fans were not receiving the promised gift packages, Saldívar said those fans were trying to get the items for free. Quintanilla, Jr. discovered Saldívar had opened the fan club's bank account under her sister's name, [...] "Maria Elida". When <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> had done this, she replied that the bank would not allow her to open an account in her name; she did not know the reason for this refusal. Saldívar abruptly left the meeting. Quintanilla, Jr. then banned Saldívar from contacting Selena. However, Selena did not want to end their friendship; she felt Saldívar was essential to the success of her clothing line in Mexico. Selena also wanted to keep Saldívar close because she had bank records, statements, and financial records necessary for tax purposes.|$|E
500|$|Simpson {{started working}} on the album in mid-July 2000. While {{compiling}} songs for Sweet Kisses, she had expressed inconvenience when a track's lyrics were too suggestive or delivered a message she {{did not agree with}} and thus asked for its modification. However, for Irresistible, she decided to let Tommy Mottola, the CEO of Columbia, take control of the whole project. He enlisted many established composers and producers for the album, hand-picked each song for the track list, and rejected those he felt were not so good. Although she had previously announced that she would write a few songs for her second album, Simpson does not share songwriting credits on any of the tracks. On being <b>asked</b> <b>why,</b> <b>she</b> said that she was very shy when it came to songwriting and felt that it requires a lot of [...] "bravery" [...] to write songs. She also expressed that she could not find the right words for the songs and hence did not write for the record. According to Simpson, the album did not have a definite concept or theme; Mottola selected songs which they felt were good enough for Simpson and compiled them into an album.|$|E
500|$|Kapoor {{followed}} her success in Bodyguard and Ra.One with {{a role in}} Shakun Batra's directorial debut Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu (2012) opposite Imran Khan. Set in Las Vegas, the romantic comedy follows {{the story of two}} strangers who get married one night after getting drunk. She played Riana Braganza, a carefree young woman, and was particularly drawn to the qualities of her character: [...] "Riana knows what she is doing.

[...] She next appeared in Agent Vinod, an espionage thriller directed by Sriram Raghavan.
