50|$|The second {{generation}} of the FIA technique, called sequential injection analysis (SIA), was conceived in 1990 by Ruzicka and Marshal, and has been further developed and miniaturized {{over the course of}} the following decade. It uses flow programming instead of the continuous flow regime (as used by CFA and FIA), that allows the flow rate and flow direction to be tailored to the need of individual steps of <b>analytical</b> <b>protocol.</b> Reactants are mixed by flow reversals and a measurement is carried out while the reaction mixture is arrested within the detector by stepping the flow. Microminiaturized chromatography is carried out on microcolumns that are automatically renewed by microfluidic manipulations. The discrete pumping and metering of microliter sample and reagent volumes used in SI only generates waste per each sample injection. The enormous volume of FI and SI literature documents the versatility of FI and SI and their usefulness for routine assays (in soil, water, environmental, biochemical and biotechnological assays) has demonstrated their potential to be used as a versatile research tool.|$|E

40|$|An <b>analytical</b> <b>protocol</b> {{was set up}} and {{successfully}} applied to study the food safety of recycled HDPE and PP crates. A worst-case scenario was applied that focused not only on overall migration and specific migration of accepted starting materials but also on migratable degradation products of polymers and additives that may be formed during mechanical recycling. The <b>analytical</b> <b>protocol</b> {{was set up to}} cover a wide variety of possible migrants. Identification and semi-quantification were possible for almost all migrants that increased significantly with increasing mechanical recycling steps for both the HDPE and PP crates. It was concluded that the <b>analytical</b> <b>protocol</b> was suitable to study the influence of (multiple) recycling on the food safety of plastic materials. The protocol can be applied to other plastic food contact materials and provides valuable information on the food safety of the recycling process and the resulting recycled food contact materials in addition to challenge testing. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is developed and implemented {{to characterize the}} pickup of various liquid chemical contaminants by polyethylene-coated magnetic particles. The model and its associated experimental and <b>analytical</b> <b>protocols</b> were applied {{to a wide range}} of liquid chemicals in order to gain insights into the physical basis for the pickup phenomenon. The characteristics of the pickup isotherms range between “ideal” and “nonideal” behaviors that are reflected in the {{mathematical model}} by a single parameter, � 0, where � 0 = 1 corresponds to ideal behavior and � 0 � 1 corresponds to a departure from idealized behavior that is directly quantified by the magnitude of � 0. The parameter � 0 is also related to the efficiency of pickup, and since most isotherms observed in the study deviate from ideality, the high efficiency of pickup observed in these systems has been attributed in part to this deviation. The proposed model and its associated experimental and <b>analytical</b> <b>protocols</b> demonstrate great potential for the systematic evaluation of the uptake of chemical contaminants using magnetic particle technology...|$|R

40|$|Several interlaboratory {{exercises}} were organised {{within the}} framework of European FP 6 project NORMAN. Among others, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were investigated in different aqueous samples in two sequential ring studies. The aim of both studies was to evaluate the state-of-art in Europe and to determine possible sources of variation, while also attempting to diminish them. In the present paper we discuss the results of the 2 nd Interlaboratory study, while the results of 1 st round were presented before. The main scope of the 1 st exercise organised within NORMAN project was to assess the laboratory proficiency regardless of the analytical method applied, to evaluate the stability of the target compounds during sample storage, and to define possible sources of variation during sample shipment, storage and analysis. In the 2 nd round we primarily aimed to diminish these sources of variation by applying two predetermined <b>analytical</b> <b>protocols</b> based on liquid chromatography¿mass spectrometry or gas chromatography¿mass spectrometry. The two <b>analytical</b> <b>protocols</b> were compared in terms of their ability to determine individual analytes in matrices of different complexity, i. e. tap water, river water and wastewater. Furthermore, the 2 nd exercise addressed also the filtration and compared the influence of different filter material categories on the analysis of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Results presented herein evaluate laboratory performance using z-score, bias, proximity and Youden plots. Overall, the laboratory performances were found to be satisfactory for determining NSAIDs in aqueous samples. The two <b>analytical</b> <b>protocols,</b> LC¿MS and GC¿MS, are assessed according to their sensitivity and measurement uncertainty, where the GC¿MS proved superior for the analysis of Ibuprofen, Ketoprofen and Naproxen in matrices with higher complexity. Finally, neither the filtration itself, nor the filter materials were shown to significantly affect the determination of NSAIDs. JRC. H. 1 -Water Resource...|$|R

40|$|This study aims at {{providing}} recommendations {{concerning the}} validation of <b>analytical</b> <b>protocols</b> by using routine samples. It {{is intended to}} provide a case-study on how to validate the analytical methods in different environmental matrices. In order to analyze the selected compounds (pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls) in two different environmental matrices, the current work has performed and validated two analytical procedures by GC-MS. A description is given of the validation of the two protocols by the analysis of more than 30 samples of water and sediments collected along nine months. The present work also scopes the uncertainty associated with both <b>analytical</b> <b>protocols.</b> In detail, uncertainty of water sample was performed through a conventional approach. However, for the sediments matrices, the estimation of proportional/constant bias is also included due to its inhomogeneity. Results for the sediment matrix are reliable, showing a range 25 – 35 % of analytical variability associated with intermediate conditions. The analytical methodology for the water matrix determines the selected compounds with acceptable recoveries and the combined uncertainty ranges between 20 and 30 %. Analyzing routine samples is rarely applied to assess trueness of novel analytical methods and up to now this methodology was not focused on organochlorine compounds in environmental matrices...|$|R

In this report, {{we explore}} the general science {{available}} for a risk-based approach to fire and fuels management and suggest analyses that may be applied at multiple scales to inform decisionmaking and tradeoff analysis.
