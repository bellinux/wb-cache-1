25|$|In {{the same}} article, he expounded upon {{the absurdity of}} a {{monetary}} {{system in which the}} taxpayer of the United States, in need of a loan, can be compelled to pay in return perhaps double the principal, or even greater sums, due to interest.

BEAR, he penetrated unknown and dangerous seas where important discoveries were made; in addition to which he made four noteworthy flights, resulting in the discovery of new mountain ranges, islands, more than a hundred thousand square miles of area, a peninsula and 700 miles of hitherto unknown stretches of the Antarctic coast. The operations of the Antarctic Service have been <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> the Government of the United States.
