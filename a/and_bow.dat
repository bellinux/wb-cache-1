5|$|The London, Tilbury and Southend Railway from Fenchurch Street was {{extended}} from Barking to Upminster in 1885. The underground Whitechapel <b>and</b> <b>Bow</b> Railway opened in 1902 and allowed through {{services of the}} District Railway to operate to Upminster. The District converted to electric trains in 1905 and services were cut back to East Ham. Delayed by World War I, electrified tracks were extended by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway to Upminster and through services resumed in 1932.|$|E
5|$|According to the Old Book of Tang, Tong Yabghu's reign {{was once}} {{considered}} as {{the golden age}} of Western Göktürk Khaganate:Tong Yehu Kaghan is a man of bravery and astuteness. He is good at art of war. Thus he controlled Tiele tribes to the north, confronted Persia to the west, connected with Kasmira (nowadays Kashmir) to the south. All countries are subjected to him. He controlled ten thousands of men with arrow <b>and</b> <b>bow,</b> establishing his power over the western region. He occupied the land of Wusun and moved his tent to Qianquan north of Tashkent. All of the princes of western region assumed the Turk office of Jielifa. Tong Yehu Kaghan also sent a Tutun to monitor them for imposition. The power of Western Turks had never reached such a state before".|$|E
60|$|Just then a {{young woman}} passed on the sidewalk; and I saw Mack kind of half snicker and blush, and then he raised up his hat <b>and</b> smiled <b>and</b> <b>bowed,</b> <b>and</b> she smiled <b>and</b> <b>bowed,</b> <b>and</b> went on by.|$|R

5|$|By the 1860s {{railways}} in East Anglia were {{in financial}} trouble, and most lines were leased to the ECR. Although the companies wished to amalgamate {{they could not}} obtain government agreement until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed. In common with most railways, signalling was fairly basic and trains were separated by time interval. As traffic levels increased {{there was a need}} to improve signalling and in 1869 the GER introduced absolute block working between Fenchurch Street, Gasworks Junction <b>and</b> <b>Bow</b> Junction, opening signal boxes at all locations.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, {{settlements}} {{had been}} established predominantly {{along the lines of}} the existing roads, and the principal villages were Stepney, Whitechapel <b>and</b> <b>Bow.</b> Settlements along the river began at this time to service the needs of shipping on the Thames, but the City of London retained its right to actually land the goods. The riverside became more active in Tudor times, as the Royal Navy was expanded and international trading developed and downstream, a major fishing port developed at Barking to provide fish to the City. These and other factors meant that industries relating to construction, repair, and victualling of naval and merchant ships flourished in the area.|$|E
5|$|In Serbia, Zaharije {{was persuaded}} by the Byzantines to revolt against Simeon. Zaharije was {{supported}} by many Bulgarians exhausted from Simeon's endless campaigns against Byzantium. The Bulgarian emperor sent his troops under Sigrica and Marmais, but they were routed and the two commanders beheaded, which forced Simeon to conclude an armistice with Byzantium in order {{to concentrate on the}} suppression of the uprising. Simeon sent an army led by Časlav Klonimirović in 924 to depose Zaharije. He was successful, as Zaharije fled to Croatia. After this victory, the Serbian nobility was invited to come to Bulgaria <b>and</b> <b>bow</b> to the new Prince. However, he did not appear at the supposed meeting and all of them were beheaded. Bulgaria annexed Serbia directly.|$|E
60|$|Peter {{could be}} {{exceeding}} polite also, having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies, and he rose <b>and</b> <b>bowed</b> to her beautifully. She was much pleased, <b>and</b> <b>bowed</b> beautifully {{to him from}} the bed.|$|R

5|$|MacMillan {{died from}} a heart attack {{backstage}} at the Royal Opera House during a performance of Mayerling. Jeremy Isaacs, the general director of the Royal Opera House, announced the death from the stage after the performance and asked the audience to rise <b>and</b> <b>bow</b> their heads and leave the theatre in silence. On the same night the junior company was presenting MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet in Birmingham. MacMillan had nearly finished work on the dances for a new production of Carousel by the National Theatre, which opened at the Lyttelton Theatre six weeks later, with his family and many of his friends in the audience.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 1768, Endeavour {{sailed to}} Galleon's Reach {{to take on}} armaments to protect her against {{potentially}} hostile Pacific island natives. Ten 4-pounder cannons were brought aboard, six of which were mounted on the upper deck and the remainder stowed in the hold. Twelve swivel guns were also supplied, and fixed to posts along the quarterdeck, sides <b>and</b> <b>bow.</b> The ship departed for Plymouth on 30 July, for provisioning and to board her crew of 85, including 12Royal Marines. Cook also ordered that twelve tons of pig iron be brought on board as sailing ballast.|$|E
5|$|The London, Tilbury and Southend Railway from Fenchurch Street and Barking was {{constructed}} through the Upminster Bridge area in 1885, with stations at Hornchurch and Upminster. The Whitechapel <b>and</b> <b>Bow</b> Railway opened in 1902 and allowed through {{services of the}} District Railway to operate to Upminster. The Metropolitan District converted to electric trains in 1905 and services were cut back to East Ham. Delayed by World War I, electrified tracks were extended by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway to Upminster and through services resumed in 1932. The District Railway was incorporated into London Transport in 1933, and {{became known as the}} District line.|$|E

Violin shops are often operated by luthiers (violinmakers) who make violin family instruments <b>and</b> <b>bows</b> for sale. Luthiers also do {{maintenance and repairs}} on violin family instruments <b>and</b> <b>bows.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Poveiro is a {{specific}} genre of boat characterized by a wide flat-bottom and a deep helm. There were diverse boats with different sizes, uses and shapes. The most notable of which, the Lancha Poveira, {{was believed to be}} derived from the Drakkar Viking, but without a long stern <b>and</b> <b>bow</b> and with a lateen sail. Each boat carried carvings, namely a sigla poveira mark for boat identification and magical-religious protection at sea. According to a tradition that persists to this day, the youngest son is the heir of the family, as in old Brittany and Denmark, because it was expected that he would take care of his parents when they became old. Women govern the family, because men were usually away from home fishing.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} to have been {{protected}} with Krupp and Wotan, Hart ("Wotan", Hard) armor plating. The class decks were 20mm thick, with 35mm thick sloped deck. The conning tower had a roof that was 50mm thick and sides 100mm thick. The inner layer of the armor belt was 50mm thick in critical areas amidships, and tapered down to zero protection at the stern <b>and</b> <b>bow.</b> The outer layer was 30mm amidships; it too tapered down to nothing {{at both ends of}} the ships. The gun turrets had the same armor protection as the preceding light cruiser : the sides were 35mm thick, the faces were 80mm thick, the roofs ranged in thickness from 2035mm. The armor protecting the turret barbettes was 60mm thick.|$|E
5|$|In 1897 the {{nominally}} independent Whitechapel & Bow Railway received {{permission for}} a link from the District Railway at Whitechapel to the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT) at an above-ground junction at Bow, {{to the west}} of Bromley station. The LT and District jointly took over the company the following year and the line opened on 2 June 1902 with new stations at Stepney Green, Mile End <b>and</b> <b>Bow</b> Road. Some District services were extended from Whitechapel to East Ham and one train each morning and evening ran through to Upminster. In July 1902 four trains an hour ran from Bow Road (2 to 3 from East Ham) to Ealing or Wimbledon and two trains an hour from New Cross served Hammersmith or Richmond. The outer circle continued to run from Mansion House, the GWR's middle circle having started at Earl's Court from 1900.|$|E

5|$|In China, {{silk-worm}} farming {{was originally}} restricted to women, and many women {{were employed in}} the silk-making industry. Even though some saw {{the development of a}} luxury product as useless, silk provoked such a craze among high society that the rules in the Li Ji were used to limit its use {{to the members of the}} imperial family. For approximately a millennium, the right to wear silk was reserved for the emperor and the highest dignitaries. Silk was, at the time, a sign of great wealth, because of its shimmering appearance. This appearance was due to silk's prism-like shape/structure, which refracted light from every angle. After some time, silk gradually extended to other classes of Chinese society. Silk began to be used for decorative means and also in less luxurious ways: musical instruments, fishing, <b>and</b> <b>bow</b> making. Peasants did not have the right to wear silk until the Qing dynasty (1644–1911).|$|E
5|$|The first {{shots were}} fired at 12:30 by Persanne close to the island of Pelagosa (Palagruža), but the main action did not begin for another hour, when Alceste and Pomone {{exchanged}} shots from their stern <b>and</b> <b>bow</b> guns. By 13:40, Alceste was firing her broadside into Pomone and simultaneously pressing on all sail {{in an effort to}} reach Pauline, but this ambition was thwarted when a shot from Pomone brought down Alcestes main topmast, slowing her suddenly and allowing Pauline to pull a little ahead. At 14:00, Active had arrived in action and was also firing into Pomone, forcing Montfort to bring Pauline round to protect her outgunned colleague. By 14:20 the conflicts between Active and Pomone and Alceste and Pauline had separated into different duels, Pomone particularly suffering severely but Active also taking heavy damage, a 32-pounder carronade shot severing Captain Gordon's leg {{at the height of the}} engagement.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} {{engagement of}} the battle was contested initially {{within sight of the}} other combatants, Persanne firing the first shots at the pursuing Unite at 12:30. The smaller size of these vessels made them faster and more manoeuvrable than their larger counterparts, and as a result it was not until 16:00 that Unite caught the smaller ship. During the pursuit, the ships had exchanged long-range shots from their stern <b>and</b> <b>bow</b> guns which caused six casualties aboard Unite but none on Persanne. From external appearances, Persanne seemed to be a frigate of similar size to the fifth rate Unite, but in fact the French ship was only lightly armed, carrying 26 small guns to her opponent's 36. As a result, {{when it became clear that}} his ship could not outrun Unite, Captain Satie surrendered after firing a token broadside rather than be destroyed by the more powerful ship.|$|E

5|$|The term Regency {{architecture}} refers {{primarily to}} {{buildings of the}} early 19th century, when GeorgeIV was still Prince Regent, and also to later buildings of the Victorian period which were designed in the same style. It follows closely on from the neo-classical Georgian style of architecture, adding an elegance and lightness of touch. Many buildings in the Regency style have a white painted stucco facade and an entryway to the main front door—usually coloured black—framed by two columns. Regency houses were typically built as terraces or crescents, often in a setting of trees and shrubs. Elegant wrought iron balconies <b>and</b> <b>bow</b> windows were also fashionable. An instigator of this style was John Nash, whose most notable work in Bristol is Blaise Hamlet, a complex of small cottages surrounding a green. It was built around 1811, for the retired employees of Quaker banker and philanthropist John Scandrett Harford, who owned Blaise Castle House. The cottages are now owned by the National Trust.|$|E
5|$|Ralph Houk {{was chosen}} to replace Stengel. During the 1961 season, both Mantle and Maris chased Ruth's single-season home run record of 60, and the pair {{attracted}} much press attention as the year progressed. Ultimately, an infection forced Mantle to leave the lineup <b>and</b> <b>bow</b> {{out of the race}} in mid-September with 54 home runs. Maris continued, though, and on October 1, {{the final day of the}} season, he homered against Red Sox pitcher Tracy Stallard into the right field stands of Yankee Stadium, breaking the record with 61. Commissioner Ford Frick decreed that two separate records be kept, as the Yankees played a 154-game schedule in 1927 (beginning in 1961, AL teams played 162 games to accommodate the league's expansion to 10 teams). MLB did away with the dual records 30 years later, giving Maris sole possession of the single-season home run record before it was broken in 1998 by Mark McGwire. The Yankees won the pennant with 109 regular season wins, at the time the club's second-highest single-season total, and defeated the Cincinnati Reds in five games to win the franchise's 19th World Series. The team hit 240 home runs to break the MLB single-season record. Maris won another AL MVP Award, while Whitey Ford captured the Cy Young Award, having posted a 25–4 record. The team gained a reputation as one of the strongest the Yankees had fielded, along with the 1927 and 1939 Yankees. New York returned to the World Series in 1962, facing the San Francisco Giants. After exchanging victories in the first six games of the Series, the Yankees won the decisive seventh game 1–0 to clinch the title.|$|E
