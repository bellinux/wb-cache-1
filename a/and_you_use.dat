60|$|Piece {{of history}} illustrative {{of the violent}} style {{of some of the}} people down along here, During the early weeks of high water, A's fence rails washed down on B's ground, and B's rails washed up in the eddy and landed on A's ground. A said, 'Let the thing remain so; I will use your rails, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>use</b> mine.' But B objected--wouldn't have it so. One day, A came down on B's ground to get his rails. B said, 'I'll kill you!' and {{proceeded}} for him with his revolver. A said, 'I'm not armed.' So B, who wished to do only what was right, threw down his revolver; then pulled a knife, and cut A's throat all around, but gave his principal attention to the front, and so failed to sever the jugular. Struggling around, A managed to get his hands on the discarded revolver, and shot B dead with it--and recovered from his own injuries.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are three}} {{words in the}} English {{language}} that end with [...] "gry". Two of these are [...] "angry" [...] and [...] "hungry".

50|$|Another {{limitation}} {{raised by}} TrueCrypt developers {{is that a}} TPM cannot be relied upon for security, because if the attacker has physical or administrative access to a computer <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>use</b> it afterwards, the computer could have been modified by the attacker: e.g., a malicious component—such as a hardware keystroke logger—could {{have been used to}} capture the password or other sensitive information. Since the TPM does not prevent an attacker from maliciously modifying a computer, VeraCrypt (a successor to TrueCrypt) will not support TPM.|$|E

Each rank explains itself, {{but there}} has been previous issues to what general and micro tracks are. The General rank is the rank that has all the tracks that don't fit with the other ranks. Micro tracks are tracks that most people use for local multiplayer plays.

5000|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 37. Harvick {{passed his}} teammate exiting turn 2 to retake {{the lead on}} lap 38. The fourth caution of the race flew on lap 54 after Joey Logano suffered a right-front tire blowout and slammed the wall in turn 3. He said afterwards that he [...] "got loose off of four and knocked the right-rear quarter off it and then got real loose. When you get loose you have to slow down more <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>use</b> a lot of brake to slow down. Usually, the next thing to go is the right-front tire and that happened. Unfortunately, I {{put us in a}} bad spot here. It's not where we want to be and we'll figure out next week." [...] Brad Keselowski opted not to pit and assumed the lead.|$|E
5000|$|One enterprising {{reference}} librarian {{found an}} eight-page pamphlet (no copyright date, {{but from the}} appearance probably printed in the 1940s) entitled Things to Think About. The booklet was filled with riddles, including the following:There are three words in the English language that end with -gry. Two of these are angry and hungry. The third word is a very common word, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>use</b> it often. If you have read what I have told you, {{you will see that}} I have given you the third word. What is the third word? Think very carefully.Three! The question {{has nothing to do with}} angry, hungry, or any of the many other obscure words that end in -gry, it is a simple question asking you what the third word in the sentence is. As you take tests, remember this.|$|E
5000|$|In August 2008, 9,000 {{copies of}} a {{resource}} guidebook for the series' first season were printed and distributed in schools in several Pacific countries. It was also released online on Wan Smolbag’s website. It suggests class activities such as group discussions focused on a particular episode (e.g. “Why {{do you think the}} three boys steal? Is breaking into houses a growing problem in your country? If so, {{why do you think it}} is happening more often?”) role playing story-writing reading scene scripts from the episodes, and discussing them. For example, students may be asked to read, understand and explain the script of a scene in which a nurse explains to a character the ways in which HIV AIDS is transmitted. (“You’ve heard of HIV and AIDS, haven’t you? It spreads through blood and sex… If there’s infected blood on a needle <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>use</b> it on someone else, they can get the sickness. … If you do a tattoo or get your ears pierced, make sure you use a new needle …!”) ...|$|E

5000|$|Finally, Shirin Vossoughi and Paula K. Hooper of Northwestern University, and Meg Escude of Exploratorium, {{offer an}} {{in-depth}} look at {{the ways in which}} Maker Education reinforces educational inequality. They begin by offering Haitian writer, Edwidge Danticat’s commentary on making: “If you can’t afford clothes, but you can make them--make them. You have to work with what you have, especially if you don’t ‘have a lot of money. You use creativity, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>use</b> imagination.” Vossoughi, Hooper, and Escude make the case that true making is often born from difficult environmental circumstances, and that what local communities once did as part of their daily lives (offering an exchange of skills and knowledge, for example, to help others in need in the community) is now being offered to low-income neighborhoods as an intervention program, promising greater educational equality. They argue that the “American Maker” highlighted by Dale Dougherty in his 2011 Ted Talk, is symptomatic of the problems associated with American exceptionalism, in that it is “grounded in gendered, white, middle-class cultural practices.” Not only do Vossoughi, Hooper, and Escude critique maker education as it is currently practiced, they also offer proposed solutions for “equity-oriented design” of maker experiences which include, “critical analyses or educational injustice, historicized approaches to making as cross-cultural activity, explicit attention to pedagogy, and inquiry into the sociopolitical values and purposes of making.” ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the same}} interview, Godley {{was asked whether}} he and Creme used the Brian Eno/Peter Schmidt 'Oblique Strategies' chance cards:No, we used dope. (Laughter.) Dope Strategies. There's only one card <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>use</b> it as a roach. The way we {{recorded}} the Brazilia track on Freeze Frame harked back to first year art college techniques. There was this great teacher who, in order to free up your mind, would say, 'OK, I want you to blindfold yourself, and you to tie your right arm behind your back, you stand on one leg... Now paint!' In other words, he would create obstacles for you to overcome as you did what you usually did. Painting whilst blindfolded frees you because you don't {{know what you are}} doing. What we did with Brazilia was, after we made a simple rhythm track, each of us - including Phil Manzanera - would come in independently and record something we wanted to hear. I would go in one evening to tape my vocal bits and pieces, then Lol, and then Phil, with none of us hearing what the others had done. Then we played it all back to see what happened: 'AAAARGHH! WHAAAAT?' ... The take that's on the album is it. Obviously with things that almost worked we had to slide 'em left or right a bit or clean out of sight. It's an interesting process, the element of chance.|$|E
5000|$|Green Party leader Elizabeth May {{dubbed the}} title {{propaganda}}, noting that [...] "other {{than the fact}} it’s for propaganda purposes, there’s no reason to call it about Internet predators", suggesting that the Conservatives were {{trying to use the}} rhetorical ploy of appealing to the sake of children to garner support. The Province suggested a more accurate name might be the [...] "Spying on Every Single Canadian any Time We Feel Like it Act". Politicians or police will talk themselves into the wisdom of using the same technology to find tax cheats, divorced parents falling behind on child support or even human-rights violators ...What if you’re a member of a faith that believes homosexuality is a sin and you send out emails arguing against gay marriage or gay adoption <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>use</b> language that is a little too strong? Or maybe you’re having your basement renovated and you boast to a friend that you’re avoiding the HST by paying cash — should that send off an alarm at the Canada Revenue Agency? Lorne Gunter, who was initially in favour of bill but reversed his stance Opposition had focused on the provisions that would allow law enforcement agencies and government-appointed inspectors to access identifying information from ISPs on demand, without a warrant. Documents leaked online showed the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police asking members to find examples of cases that would have profited from lawful access, but no cases had been found, leading critics to charge that police were already able to prosecute predators successfully in Canada with existing legislation.|$|E
