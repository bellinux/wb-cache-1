5|$|Live {{performances}} {{before an}} audience constitute a major form of entertainment, especially before the invention of <b>audio</b> <b>and</b> <b>video</b> recording.

Opera is a similarly demanding performance style that remains popular. It also encompass all three forms, demanding a high level of musical and dramatic skill, collaboration and like the masque, production expertise as well.|$|E

The company was founded by an audiophile and engineer, Noel Lee, in 1979 by experimenting with different ways to build audio cables. It grew by doing demonstrations to convince the industry that audio cables made a difference in audio quality and by establishing relationships with retailers that were attracted to the cable's profit margins.|$|E

5|$|These {{and other}} {{differences}} reflect the differing design {{goals of the}} two buses: USB was designed for simplicity and low cost, while FireWire was designed for high performance, particularly in time-sensitive applications such as <b>audio</b> <b>and</b> <b>video.</b> Although similar in theoretical maximum transfer rate, FireWire400 is faster than USB2.0 high-bandwidth in real-use, especially in high-bandwidth use such as external hard drives. The newer FireWire800 standard is {{twice as fast as}} FireWire400 and faster than USB2.0 high-bandwidth both theoretically and practically. However, FireWire's speed advantages rely on low-level techniques such as direct memory access (DMA), which in turn have created opportunities for security exploits such as the DMA attack.|$|E
5|$|Advertising on the Internet was liberalized by the Government in {{time for}} the 2011 general elections. Two forms of {{political}} advertising on the Internet are permitted during parliamentary elections. First, during the election period – that is, the period between the day the writ of election is issued and the start of polling day – political parties, candidates or election agents may use the Internet to further candidates' campaigns, including using websites, chat rooms or discussion forums, video and photograph sharing or hosting websites, e-mail, micro-blog posts (such as Twitter), SMS and MMS messages, digital <b>audio</b> <b>and</b> <b>video</b> files, electronic media applications, and blogs and social networking services (such as Facebook). Election advertising sent by e-mail, micro-blog post, SMS or MMS must contain a functioning e-mail address or mobile phone number to enable recipients to indicate that they do not wish to receive further messages from the sender.|$|E
5|$|Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) allows data packets to be {{used for}} {{synchronous}} voice communications. The data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real-time, synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types of data traffic which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered in advance (i.e. <b>audio</b> <b>and</b> <b>video)</b> without detriment. That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking {{place at the same time}} and the network is enabled for prioritization i.e. a private corporate style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.|$|E
