5|$|David was {{conceptualized}} {{as a character}} to provide a non-human perspective for the theme of meeting one's creators in Prometheus, with him representing the next generation {{in a line of}} creators who finds himself disillusioned by his predecessors. Fassbender, who was director Ridley Scott's first choice for the role, helped fashion the character to share traits with T. E. Lawrence, who was a source of inspiration <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>control</b> freak caught between two cultures- the cultures being humanity and synthetics, in David's case. As the series progresses, David's behaviors and motivations evolve from a mysterious agent with ambiguous motivations to a character directly opposing the well-being of humanity.|$|E
5|$|Salk's vaccine {{was then}} {{used in a}} test called the Francis Field Trial, led by Thomas Francis, the largest medical {{experiment}} in history at that time.

By {{the conclusion of the}} study, roughly 440,000 received one or more injections of the vaccine, about 210,000 children received a placebo, consisting of harmless culture media, and 1.2 million children received no vaccination and served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>control</b> group, who would then be observed to see if any contracted polio.|$|E
5|$|Tombaugh's {{task was}} to {{systematically}} capture sections {{of the night sky}} in pairs of images. Each image in a pair was taken two weeks apart. He then placed both images of each section in a machine called a blink comparator, which by exchanging images quickly created a time lapse illusion of the movement of any planetary body. To reduce the chances that a faster-moving (and thus closer) object be mistaken for the new planet, Tombaugh imaged each region near its opposition point, 180 degrees from the Sun, where the apparent retrograde motion for objects beyond Earth's orbit is at its strongest. He also took a third image <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>control</b> to eliminate any false results caused by defects in an individual plate. Tombaugh decided to image the entire zodiac, rather than focus on those regions suggested by Lowell.|$|E

40|$|Korea is the first, {{and perhaps}} only, country to {{classify}} pro-pofol <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> substance.

25|$|Because the GAPDH gene {{is often}} stably and constitutively {{expressed}} {{at high levels}} in most tissues and cells, it is considered a housekeeping gene. For this reason, GAPDH is commonly used by biological researchers as a loading control for western blot and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>control</b> for qPCR. However, researchers have reported different regulation of GAPDH under specific conditions. For example, the transcription factor MZF-1 {{has been shown to}} regulate the GAPDH gene. Therefore, the use of GAPDH as loading control has to be considered carefully.|$|E
25|$|Bergen Airport, Sandviken {{proved too}} small for DNL's routes with the {{introduction}} of the Short Sandringham, most due to ship traffic in the area. The airport at Hjellestad opened on 23 August 1948. It consisted of a small cabin used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>control</b> tower, a small terminal building. Smaller aircraft could dock at a floating wharf, while the larger Sandringhams anchored at a buoy. The airport was closed in 1951, after DNL closed its Oslo routes and traffic moved back to Sandviken.|$|E
25|$|Others have {{suggested}} that fractional pricing was first adopted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>control</b> on employee theft.

For cash transactions with an odd price, the cashier must make change for the customer. This generally means opening the cash register which creates a record of the sale in the register and reduces the risk of the cashier stealing from the store owner.|$|E
