40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} ionic {{mechanisms}} of electrophysiologic changes in cell excitability and action potential duration during the acute phase of myocardial ischemia. Methods: Using an ionic-based theoretical {{model of the}} cardiac ventricular cell, the dynamic LRd w x. model, we have simulated the three major component conditions of acute ischemia elevated K, acidosis and anoxia at the level ofo individual ionic currents and ionic concentrations. The conditions were applied individually and in combination to identify ionic mechanisms responsible for reduced excitability at rest potentials, delayed recovery of excitability, and shortened action potential w x. duration. Results: Increased extracellular potassium K had the major effect on cell excitability by depolarizing resting membraneo. w xpotential V, causing reduction in sodium channel availability. Acidosis caused a K-independent reduction in maximum upstrokerest o. velocity, dV rd t. A transition from sodium-current dominated to calcium-current dominated upstroke occurred, and calcium currentm max. alone was able to sustain the upstroke, but only after sodium channels were almost completely 97 % inactivated. Acidic conditions prevented the transition to calcium dominated upstroke by <b>acidic</b> <b>reduction</b> of both sodium and calcium currents. Anoxia, simulated by w xlowering ATP and activating the ATP-dependent potassium current, I, was the only process that could decrease action potentiali KATP. duration by more than 50 % and reproduce AP shape changes that are observed experimentally.

40|$|A {{long-term}} {{model of}} stream acidification, MAGIC, {{has been applied}} to an acidic moorland catchment, the Gwy, in mid-Wales. This application has been used {{to examine the effects of}} variability of weathering on soil, groundwater and stream water chemistry from 1844 to the present day and onwards to 2080 with a predicted <b>acidic</b> oxide <b>reduction</b> of 60 % in the future. The results show that weathering initially affects soil, groundwater and stream water chemistry profoundly. Despite this, the results indicate that a simple two-layer (one soil and one groundwater end-member) model can still provide a good prediction of long-term stream water quality even when each soil and groundwater area is heterogeneous in composition. The work provides support for the use of the lumped MAGIC model. However, for the predictions to be applicable it is shown that it is critical that the relative contribution of waters and soil exchange materials from the hydrochemically distinct regions within the catchment are adequately represented within the model. This probably means that further field work is required to examine source area contributions. Pages: 187 - 20...|$|R

30|$|The poor oxygen {{reduction}} kinetics on Pt electrodes has {{stimulated the}} study of oxygen reduction on other bimetallic catalysts [9, 10, 11, 12]. One {{of the most active}} catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of oxygen is Au (100) in alkaline solution, which exhibits an even higher activity than polycrystalline Pt. It is remarkable however that gold single-crystal electrodes show exceptional structural selectivity toward water or hydrogen peroxide.

The radical chain mechanism of xanthate reduction with NHC-boranes has been established by the evaluation of rate constants of hydrogen abstraction, the isolation of boron-derived by-products, and EPR spectroscopic studies. NHC-BH 3 complexes have been found to react with many electrophilic compounds. They reduce alkyl halides and sulfonates by an ionic mechanism. The boron products of their reactions with halogenation agents, Brønsted and Lewis acids were isolated and characterized. NHC-boryl iodide and triflate complexes undergo nucleophilic substitutions at the boron atom. In this way, a variety of substituted boranes with unusual and unprecedented structural motifs were prepared, including boryl azides, nitrosooxyborane, and nitroborane. The reaction with phenoxides in tetrahydrofuran (THF) afforded unexpected products of THF ring opening. A compound with a novel dihydroxyborenium cation was obtained from certain disubstituted NHC-boranes under <b>acidic</b> conditions. <b>Reduction</b> of NHC-boryl iodide complex with lithium di-tert-butylbiphenylide (LDDB) gave a reactive NHC-boryl anion. This was trapped with several electrophiles to obtain boron-substituted complexes, including acyl boranes.

Extracts of embrionary axes and cotyledons enriched in phenolics increased (center dot) NO formation at acidic pH at values that were 7. 1 and 4. 5 times higher, respectively, {{when compared to the}} reduction of the nonenriched extracts. Among the various phenolics accumulated in the soybean extracts, five stimulated nitrite reduction in the following decreasing order of potency: epicatechin gallate, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, galic acid and p-coumaric acid. Extracts of embrionary axes presented higher contents of epicatechin gallate and caffeic acid, compared to that of cotyledons, indicating a positive correlation between activity of the extracts and content of phenolics with regard to nitrite reducing activity. Soybean extracts enriched in phenolics interacted synergistically with acidified nitrite to prevent E. coli O 157 :H 7 growth.

Recently theoretical calculations and real time electron transfer measurements indicated the involvement of residues {{in the vicinity of}} the ring A propionate of heme a 3, including Asp 399 and the CuB ligands His 325, 326. In this study we probed the interaction of Asp 399 with the binuclear center and characterize the protonation state of its side chain. Redox induced FTIR difference spectra of mutations at the site in direct comparison to wild type, indicate that below pH 5 Asp 399 displays signals typical for the deprotonation of the <b>acidic</b> residue with <b>reduction</b> of the enzyme. Interestingly at a pH higher than 5, no contributions from Asp 399 are evident. In order to probe the interaction of the site with the binuclear center we followed the rebinding of CO by infrared spectroscopy for mutations on residue Asp 399 to Glu, Asn and Leu. Previously different CO conformers have been identified for bacterial cytochrome c oxidases, and its pH dependent behaviour discussed to be relevant for catalysis.

Quantitative confocal microscopy showed {{that there is a}} transient loss of fluorescence at early times after the initiation of endocytosis of rVSV-ML-Green (rVSV-MLG) virions, which did not occur when cells were treated with bafilomycin A 1. The reduction in fluorescence occurred 5 to 10 min postentry, followed by a steady increase in fluorescence intensity from 15 to 60 min postentry. A similar loss of fluorescence was observed in vitro when virions were exposed to <b>acidic</b> pH. The <b>reduction</b> in fluorescence required G protein since “bald ” G-MLG particles did not show a similar loss of fluorescence at low pH. Based on the pH-dependent fluorescence properties of Lumio Green, we hypothesize that the loss of fluorescence of rVSV-MLG virions during virus entry is due to a G ectodomain-dependent acidification of the virion interior. Biochemical analysis indicated that low pH also resulted in an enhancement of M protein dissociation from partially permeabilized, but otherwise intact, wild-type virions. From these data we propose that low-pH conformational changes in G protein promote acidification of the virus interior, which facilitates the release of M from ribonucleoprotein particles during uncoating.

40|$|Isolated haemosiderin {{contained}} {{iron and}} nitrogen in a weight ratio of 6. 75, with phosphorus and no detectable haem. Considerably more iron {{was released from}} haemosiderin under acidic conditions than under neutral conditions {{in the presence of}} ascorbate, nitrilotriacetate or dithionite. Unlike the situation with ascorbate, chelators such as citrate, ADP or succinate induced the release of only some iron, with almost no pH-dependence. Dehydroascorbate (the oxidized form of ascorbate with no reducing capacity) behaved like citrate, ADP, succinate or desferal, rather than like ascorbate itself, in releasing iron. GSH had less effect on the release of iron than these chelators, but {{in the presence of a}} small amount of chelator the release of iron increased, especially under <b>acidic</b> conditions. Thus <b>reduction,</b> chelation and pH were all found to be important factors involved in the release of iron from haemosiderin. Investigation by e. p. r. of hydroxyl-radical production by the released iron showed high radical productivity at an acidic pH. However, at a physiological pH, almost no radical formation was detected, except in the presence of nitrilotriacetate. These findings suggested that, under physiological conditions, haemosiderin was not an effective iron donor and was almost not involved in radical production.

All T. cristatus embryos failed to hatch at pH 4. 5, whereas over 80 % of T. helveticus and T. vulgaris embryos hatched successfully at the same pH. At pH 7. 5, T. cristatus survival {{was the same as}} the other two species, after the 50 % mortality due to the homomorphism of chromosome 1 was taken into account.

We recently demonstrated the neoplastic potential of gastroduodenal fluids (GDF) on hypopharyngeal mucosa, via NF-κB, using in vitro and in vivo models. Here we will explore the in vivo effect of GDF on laryngeal mucosa (LM) to induce early preneoplastic lesions related to NF-κB activation, along with deregulation of specific microRNA (miRNA) markers previously linked to laryngeal cancer. We used histological, immunohistochemical, automated quantitative analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction to examine LM from 35 C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice previously treated with topical GDF against corresponding controls (4 experimental and 3 control groups; 5 mice/group). Our analysis showed that GDF produced early preneoplastic lesions in treated LM related to NF-κB activation. LM treated by acid and bile combination demonstrated significantly higher expression of the analyzed cell proliferation markers (Ki 67, CK 14, ∆Np 63), oncogenic p-STAT 3, and changes of cell adhesion molecules (E-cadherin, ϐ-catenin) versus untreated LM or LM exposed to acid alone (P <. 0005). Furthermore, acidic bile but not neutral bile appeared to accelerate the expression of “oncomirs” miR- 21, miR- 155, and miR- 192 (acidic bile versus neutral bile, P <. 0001), while reducing tumor suppressor miR- 375 (acidic bile versus neutral bile, P =. 0137), previously linked to NF-κB and laryngeal cancer. Finally, <b>acidic</b> bile induced <b>reduction</b> of miR- 34 a, miR- 375, and miR- 451 a, exhibiting an inverse correlation with NF-κB activation.

Similar <b>reductions</b> were observed for the untreated GW feedstock. Soil was amended with biochar or feedstock giving application rates of 1 and 5 %. Following an initial incubation, nitrogen (N) was added at 165  kg/ha as urea. Microcosms were again incubated before being brought to 100 % water-filled porosity and held at this water content for a further 47 days. The flooding phase accounted for the majority (< 80 %) of total N 2 O emissions. The control soil released 3165  mg N 2 O-N/m 2, or 15. 1 % of the available N as N 2 O. Amendment with 1 and 5 % GW feedstock significantly reduced emissions to 1470 and 636  mg N 2 O-N/m 2, respectively. This was equivalent to 8. 6 and 3. 8 % of applied N. The GW biochar produced at 350 °C was least effective in reducing emissions, resulting in 1625 and 1705  mg N 2 O-N/m 2 for 1 and 5 % amendments. Amendment with BS biochar at 5 % had the greatest impact, reducing emissions to 518  mg N 2 O-N/m 2, or 2. 2 % of the applied N over the incubation period. Metabolic activity as measured by CO 2 production could not explain the differences in N 2 O emissions between controls and amendments, nor could NH 4 + or NO 3 – concentrations in biochar-amended soils. A decrease in NH 4 + and NO 3 – following GW feedstock application {{is likely to have}} been responsible for reducing N 2 O emissions from this amendment. Reduction in N 2 O emissions from the biochar-amended soils was attributed to increased adsorption of NO 3 –. Small reductions are possible due to improved aeration and porosity leading to lower levels of denitrification and N 2 O emissions. Alternatively, increased pH was observed, which can drive denitrification through to dinitrogen during soil flooding. </p...|$|R
40|$|Even at {{sublethal}} concentrations, various anthropogenic pollutants may {{disrupt the}} transfer of chemosensory information, often inducing maladaptive behavioral responses. Recent studies of freshwater prey fishes have shown impaired abilities to respond to damage-released chemical alarm cues from conspecifics under weakly acidic conditions (pH; 6. 0). Several factors acting individually or collectively may account for such chemosensory impairment. By itself, acidification may chemically disrupt the alarm cues and affect fish olfactory functions. Alternatively, differences in local environmental conditions may affect biochemical composition, quantity of chemical alarm cues produced by epidermal tissue, or both, leading to variations in alarm response. Our goal was to assess whether the ability to produce and detect onspecific chemical alarm cues is similar in individuals reared under neutral versus acidic conditions. We conducted two experiments in which we measured the behavioral response of wild juvenile Atlantic salmon Salmo salar exposed to chemical alarm cues. In particular, we looked for differences {{in the ability of}} individual fish to (1) produce alarm cues capable of eliciting consistent antipredator behavior in conspecifics and (2) detect alarm cues upon the fish’s introduction into a stream with a pH differing from that of the stream of origin; the latter experiment involved reciprocal transplant of fish between neutral (pH range; 7. 0 – 7. 3) and acidic (pH range; 5. 9 – 6. 3) sites. Our results demonstrate that the ability to produce and respond to chemical alarm cues is maintained in Atlantic salmon reared under acidic conditions and did not differ from that of fish reared under neutral conditions. Overall, these data suggest that no permanent olfactory damage occurred under reduced pH and, likewise, no significant difference in functional alarm cue production existed between Atlantic salmon reared under neutral and <b>acidic</b> conditions. Short-term <b>reduction</b> in olfactory sensitivity and degradation of the chemical alarm cues under acidic conditions are the likely mechanisms affecting detection of these important chemicals by prey fish...|$|R

The acidic strength of the catalysts was measured using a n-butylamine potentiometric titration method. The bulk BaTiO 3 catalyst exhibits a tetragonal phase with the P 4 mm space group. A structural transition from tetrahedral to cubic phase was observed for Fe, Co and Ni doped BaTiO 3 catalysts with an increase in doped metal concentration from 1 to 5 mol%. The particle sizes of the catalysts were calculated from TEM images and are in the range of 30 - 80 nm. All the catalysts were tested for the catalytic reduction of nitrobenzene to azoxybenzene. The BaTiO 3 catalyst was found to be highly active and less selective compared to the doped catalysts which are active and highly selective towards azoxybenzene. The increase in selectivity towards azoxybenzene is due to an increase in <b>acidic</b> strength and <b>reduction</b> ability of the doped metal. It was also observed that the nature of the metal dopant and their content at the B-site has an impact on the catalytic reduction of nitrobenzene.

Therefore, this work assessed the proteins, polyphenols, metals, and haze forming tendency when heating white wine samples before and after a fin- ing treatment with four activated sodium bentonites in a typical wine pH range (3. 00 to 3. 60). Soluble wine proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and gel images were compared using the Quantity One software package (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA). The wine haze forming tendency, metals, and polyphenols were measured using heat tests and International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) methods. Low molecular mass proteins were efficiently removed {{by all of the}} bentonites, regardless of the pH. High and medium molecular mass proteins {{were less likely to be}} removed and the efficiency, which depended on the pH, was variable. Reductions of vacuolar invertase (GIN 1) and VVTL 1 fractions of the thaumatin-like proteins were induced by bentonites with pH values less than 10. These bentonites were affected to a lesser extent by the negative effect of <b>acidic</b> pH. The <b>reduction</b> in haze forming tendency of the unfined Erbaluce wine was particularly notice- able in bentonite fined samples heated at 50 to 60 °C, 60 to 80 °C, and 70 to 80 °C at pH 3. 17, pH 3. 30, and pH 3. 60, respectively. The poor removal of glycoproteins (YGP 1 and Hmp 1) at higher pH values contributed to an increased thermal stability. The exchange of cationic species, notably sodium and potassium, between the bentonites and the wine was related more to the wine pH than to the clay type. Finally, the extent of polyphenol removal correlated with the amount of protein removed. When protein removal did not occur, the reduction of polyphenols was driven by the specific surface area and the surface charge density of the bentonite...|$|R
40|$|The voltage {{dependent}} Mg 2 + {{block of}} GluN 2 A-containing NMDARs {{is essential for}} activity-induced neuroplasticity. The GRIN 2 A gene, encoding the NMDAR subunits GluN 2 A, {{was found to be}} disrupted or mutated in individuals with mental retardation and/or epilepsy. In my thesis work I performed behavioral test, genotyping, western-blot analysis and many different histological technics to analyze protein expression and anatomical structures of neurons and glia of mice carrying a gene targeted point mutation, Grin 2 A(N 596 S), in the gene encoding NMDAR subunit GluN 2 A. This mutation causes the loss of the Mg 2 + block and a decrease in Ca 2 + permeability and it is homologous to a human de novo point mutation Grin 2 A(N 615 K), found in a young patient with severe mental retardation and epileptic seizures (Endele S. et al., 2010). As in humans, mice homozygous for the mutation (Grin 2 aS/S) have profound cognitive impairments and, analyzing their performance in a battery of behavioral test such as the Burrowing test, the Crawley’s sociability test, the Cliff avoidance reaction (CAR) test and the passive avoidance (PA) test, emerged that Grin 2 aS/S mice express also features related to ADHD, which are hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity. On the other hand, in heterozygous Grin 2 aS/N mice the mutation had a lower penetrance, resulting in an intermediate behavior and ambiguous ADHD-like phenotype compared to the other two groups of mice, Grin 2 aS/S and Grin 2 aN/N courts phenotype. Grin 2 aS/S mice exhibited a 100 % penetrance of generalized convulsive seizure induced by an external stimulus (11 kHz tone), namely Audiogenic Seizure (AGS). The AGS ended always with respiratory arrest and the death, resembling the same human process called SUDEP (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy). The epileptic phenotype could be genetically rescued in a different genetic background of FVB mice or pharmacologically by low doses of memantine. Western blot analysis reveled no differences in NMDAR subunits protein expression and other kinds of scaffolding proteins enriched in the PSD in forebrain membrane fraction of P 28 Grin 2 aS/S, Grin 2 aS/N and Grin 2 aN/N mice. Moreover, c-fos and arc expression were verified by immunofluorescence after tone induction, confirming published data about AGS-related brain circuit. I also examined the presence of gliosis and neurodegeneration, 24 hours and 8 days after seizure induction, discovering a GFAP (glial fibrillary <b>acidic</b> protein) <b>reduction</b> in some brain areas and gliosis-plaque in the cortex of Grin 2 aS/S mice; furthermore, Silver and NeuN stainings highlighted signs of neurodegeneration in the same brain areas related to AGS. Finally, using the Golgi impregnation technique I compared the normal brain development and neuronal structure in mutated and wild-type mice. In summary, the results of my research revealed an ADHD-like phenotype in Grin 2 aS/S mice, coupled with a strong epileptic phenotype, which caused the death of the animal and some molecular adaptive responses in the brain circuit related to the seizure, but that it could be prevented by memantine, a drug commonly used in therapy...|$|R
40|$|This review {{assesses the}} {{adaptability}} {{and effectiveness of}} the basic practices to mitigate the N 2 O emissions from the arable land in the climate, soil and agricultural conditions of Poland. We have analyzed the decrease in the nitrogen-based fertilization, selection of the fertilizer nitrogen forms, use of biological inhibitors of nitrogen transformation in the soil, control of the <b>acidic</b> soil reaction, <b>reduction</b> in the natural fertilizers use and afforestation of the low productive soils. The challenge evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation practices lies in the inadequacy of the national data on N 2 O soil emissions in particular agrotechnical conditions. In Poland, circumstances that favor intensive N 2 O emissions from the arable soils occur uncommonly, as shows {{the analysis of the}} literature reporting on the country climate, soil and agricultural conditions alongside the N 2 O emissions from soils under various cultivation conditions. Consequently, the effectiveness of mitigation practices that relies on an extensification of plant production may be insufficient. It can be assumed that, at the doses of nitrogen fitting the nutritional needs of crops, the soil N 2 O emissions are low and do not meaningfully differ from the emissions from untreated soils (literature data point to limited N 2 O emission from arable soils treated with N doses of ≤ 150 - 200 kg N·ha- 1). The effectiveness of the nitrogen fertilization reduction as an N 2 O emissions mitigation practice is restricted to intensive farming. A universal registry of the mineral and natural fertilization use could help identify the agricultural holdings with a potential for high N 2 O emission and foster a targeted application of mitigation practices. It is suggested that normalization and maintenance of the optimum (i. e. close to neutral) soil pH should become a more common practice of N 2 O emissions mitigation in Poland in view of the extent of arable soils acidification and the literature data that indicate elevated N 2 O emissions from acid soils. Application of urease and nitrification inhibitors alongside nitrogen fertilization can be considered an effective practice of N 2 O emissions mitigation. Owing to economic reasons the use of nitrogen fertilizers with such additives is currently limited to non-agricultural segments of plant production. Afforestation of the low productive soils offers an attractive opportunity for mitigation of N 2 O emissions. Whereas N 2 O emissions from forest soils are considerably lower compared with those from the arable ones, the literature indicates that no N 2 O emissions mitigation is attained through a conversion of arable land to agroforestry. Considering the current forest area of Poland (24. 9 % of the total area) and the plans to increase the afforestation rate (to 33 % in 2050) the measurable effects of this mitigation practice will only be seen in a long-term perspective...|$|R
40|$|Electrification of {{vehicles}} could enable the transportation sector {{to be more}} efficient with reduced emissions. Polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) vehicles powered by sustainably generated hydrogen fuel would be a viable replacement for internal combustion engines. PEFC powered vehicles are highly efficient and offer zero tailpipe emissions. State-of-the-art PEFCs rely on platinum (Pt) and platinum alloy catalyst nanoparticles supported on high surface area carbon black bound by ionomer. The high Pt loadings currently needed for the low-temperature <b>acidic</b> oxygen <b>reduction</b> reaction (ORR) incur significant costs due to the Pt raw material. Degradation of conventional carbon supported Pt electrodes remains a challenge for the commercialization of PEFCs. In the cathode, the ORR is sluggish and results in a large overpotential loss and hence reducing the Pt utilization. The strategy to make PEFC commercially viable is by reducing the cost through either {{reducing the amount of}} Pt in the electrode or replacing the Pt catalyst with alternative low-cost catalysts. Ionomer binder in conventional electrodes needed for proton conduction introduces undesirable high oxygen transport resistance that further reduces the Pt efficacy. However, novel ionomer-free electrodes, which have an advantage of no ionomer film resistance, relies on water for proton conduction and thus hindering the performance and stability at dry conditions. Alternative electrode designs can potentially alleviate some of the problems in these high power density devices. This work presents an alternative composite Nafion nanofiber catalyst support electrode, in which the oriented nanofibers provide robust internal proton transport to a conformal Pt catalyst coating without impeding oxygen transport. The high-surface-area electrodes are prepared by solution casting Nafion onto a sacrificial template, and thin Pt films are deposited on the nanofibers using either physical vapor deposition or chemical vapor deposition. The electrochemical characterization of the nanofiber electrodes demonstrates the high current density and specific activity of this nanofiber approach relative to prior electrodes fabricated by depositing Pt directly onto other Nafion surfaces. Even with the improved electrode architecture, the Pt raw material cost is still an obstacle. Hence, Pt group metal-free (PGM-free) PEFC cathodes are of significant interest for low-temperature ORR since they have the potential to reduce PEFC costs dramatically. The activity and durability of PGM-free catalyst have significantly improved in vii the last 10 years. However, several challenges remain before they can become commercially viable. The PGM-free catalysts have lower volumetric activity and hence the PGM-free cathodes are thicker than Pt-based electrodes. Thus, they suffer from significantly greater gas and proton transport resistances that reduce the observed performance and robustness of operation. To better understand the efficacy of the catalyst and improve electrode performance, a detailed understanding of the correlation between electrode fabrication, morphology, and performance is crucial. This dissertation reports the characterization of PEFC cathodes featuring a PGM-free catalyst using nano-scale resolution X-ray computed tomography (nano-CT) and morphological analysis. In this work, the pore/solid structure and the Nafion distribution was resolved in three dimensions (3 D) using nano-CT for three PGM-free electrodes of varying Nafion loading. The particular PGM-free cathode being studied feature two distinct length scales of interest and was resolved using multi-resolution imaging in nano-CT. The associated transport properties were evaluated from pore/particle-scale simulations within the nano-CT imaged structure. These characterizations are then used to elucidate the microstructural origins of the dramatic changes in fuel cell performance with varying Nafion loading. The results show that this is primarily a result of distinct changes in Nafions spatial distribution. The significant impact of electrode morphology on performance highlights the importance of PGM-free electrode development in concert with efforts to improve catalyst activity and durability. To understand the potential distribution in the thick electrodes we utilize a novel experimental technique to measure the electrolyte potential directly at discrete points across the thickness of the catalyst layer and evaluate the ORR along the thickness of the catalyst layer. Using that technique, the electrolyte potential drop, the through-thickness reaction distribution, and the proton conductivity is measured and correlated with the corresponding Nafion morphology and cell performance. At this stage of PGM-free catalyst development, it is also necessary to optimize these thick electrodes along with the catalyst. To address the significant transport losses in thick PGM-free cathodes (ca. 3 ̆e 60 m), we developed a two-dimensional (2 D) hierarchical electrode model that resolves the unique structure of the PGM-free electrode. The 2 D computational model is employed to correlate the morphology and the electrochemical performance of the PGM-free electrodes. The model is a complete cell, continuum model that includes an agglomerate model representation of the cathode. A unique feature of the approach is the integration of the model with morphology and transport parameter statistics extracted from nano-CT imaging of the electrodes. The model was validated with experimental results of the PGM-free electrode with three levels of Nafion loading. We discuss the sensitivity of the PGM-free catalyst layer on the operating conditions and the morphological parameters to identify improved architectures for PGM-free cathodes. We employ the model to evaluate the targets for the volumetric activity of the catalyst. A notable finding is the impact of the liquid water accumulation in the electrode and the significant performance improvement possible if electrode flooding is mitigated...|$|R
