25|$|Kat and Alfie {{holiday in}} Spain, and bring Shenice back with them. Upon their return, Kat gets {{pregnant}} again. Alfie {{believes that he}} cannot have children and assumes Kat has cheated on him, despite her insistence to the contrary. Alfie learns that he is wrong, but Kat is hurt by his accusation and will not let him near her, even after suffering a miscarriage. Kat has a one-night stand with Mark Garland (Chris Simmons), which she instantly regrets. She eventually confesses to Alfie, and tells him that her behaviour is how she is <b>and</b> <b>always</b> <b>will</b> be. Alfie tells Kat he would rather have her cheat on him than not have her in his life. The couple attempt to mend relations with each other over Christmas, but Alfie overhears Kat saying that she thinks he no longer loves her. Alfie books a session with a marriage counsellor, which Kat initially refuses to attend. She turns up late, and Alfie tells her the counsellor never arrived. Alfie pays his friend Gerry (Paul Reynolds) {{to pretend to be}} a marriage counsellor, who comes to their home. Kat tells Gerry that she believes Alfie does not love her any more and so she wants to end their marriage.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, J.T. and Colleen {{become friends}} again and she stands by him while his {{pregnant}} fiance, Victoria, is in a coma. When Colleen's father goes missing in 2009, {{she goes to}} J.T. for help finding him. They discover his dead body frozen in the ice of the river. He comforts her while she deals with her loss. Colleen blames Brad's longtime enemy and J.T.'s father-in-law, Victor Newman (Eric Braeden), for her father's death and attempts {{to get back at}} him by claiming Brad's seat on the Newman board. Victor orders J.T. to find something damaging on Colleen that will force her to give up the seat. J.T. does not follow Victor's orders, but Victor gets what he wants by paying Gloria and Jeffry Bardwell to catch Colleen in a compromising position. They pay a bartender to get her drunk. Under the influence of alcohol, she flashes her breasts in public, which Jeffrey catches on camera. Once the footage of her is made public, Colleen is asked to resign from the Newman board. This only brings J.T. and Colleen closer. They begin bringing up suppressed feelings and on August 17, 2009 they kiss and are spotted by a spy of Victor's. This soon is heard by the Newmans that J.T. was seen coming out of Colleen's home the next morning. Colleen is confronted by J.T.'s wife, Victoria. Colleen is kidnapped by her Uncles Jack's unstable ex-wife, Patty Williams. She escapes by canoe on the lake but falls into the water and nearly drowns. She is found by Jack and brought to the hospital. On September 22, it is confirmed that Colleen is brain dead because of her accident on the lake. On September 28, the doctors announce that Colleen is an organ donor, and Traci decides to give Colleen's heart to Victor Newman. On her death bed, a heartbroken J.T tells Colleen that he loves her <b>and</b> <b>always</b> <b>will.</b>|$|E

500|$|In July 2014, audio leaked of Spears {{singing the}} song without pitch correction.

CNN defended the track, saying that its quality is irrelevant as Spears is not known for her vocal ability.

500|$|Soon {{after his}} death, the Viscount of Inhaúma {{was hailed as}} [...] "one of the {{greatest}} figures of the Brazilian armada" [...] in the Brazilian Senate. He was extremely popular in the armada and was fondly called [...] "Uncle Joaquim" [...] by his subordinates. The Brazilian navy's slang phrase, [...] "andar na Inácia", which meant to behave correctly, was derived from his name. Since 1870, no comprehensive biography of Inhaúma has been published, even though he, according to Francisco Eduardo Alves de Almeira, [...] "is, <b>and</b> <b>always</b> <b>will</b> be, important to the navy of Brazil for his example as a modest and dedicated chief". The Inhaúma-class corvette, built in the 1980s and 1990s, was named after him.

Schlamme will create the look of the shows, work with the other directors, discuss the scripts with Sorkin as soon as they are turned in, make design and casting decisions, and attend the budget meetings; Sorkin tends to stick strictly to writing. In response to what he perceived as unfair criticism of The Newsroom, Jacob Drum of Digital Americana wrote, [...] "The essential truth that the critics miss is that The Newsroom is Sorkin being Sorkin as he always has been <b>and</b> <b>always</b> <b>will</b> be: one part pioneer; one part self-conscious romantic; two parts actual Lewis & Clark-style pioneer, trapping his way across an old, old idea of an America that can always stand to raise its game—but most importantly, spinning a good yarn while he does so." ...|$|E

500|$|Amon Amarth and Unleashed's music {{could be}} {{described}} as death metal, but it incorporates Viking lyrical themes and thus the bands are considered to have broadened the scope of Viking metal. While Norse myths were mostly important for black metal, especially the early 1990s Norwegian scene, {{as well as for the}} younger pagan metal genre, bands as the Swedish Unleashed started fitting these myths into death metal even before Amon Amarth appeared. Unleashed set a precedent for many of the coming black metal bands by shying away from the common death metal theme of gore and instead focusing on pre-Christian Swedish heathenism, particularly the Viking Age and old Norse religion. Both Amon Amarth and Unleashed, however, resist the Viking metal label. Johan Hegg of Amon Amarth stated, [...] "It's weird to label a band after the lyrical content because, in that case, Iron Maiden is a Viking metal band, Black Sabbath is a Viking metal band, Led Zeppelin is a Viking metal band." [...] Johnny Hedlund of Unleashed maintains that the band has always played <b>and</b> <b>always</b> <b>will</b> play death metal, commenting, [...] "The Viking lyrics you will find on about three to five songs on every Unleashed album from 1991 and on. I don't think that fact alone re-defines our style in some way." ...|$|E
500|$|Media {{reviews of}} Lions were mixed. Numerous writers {{detected}} a Led Zeppelin influence (which was praised by some, but panned by others) and attributed it to The Black Crowes' recent tour with Jimmy Page. [...] Dave McKenna, writing for The Washington Post, compared Steve Gorman's drumming {{to that of}} John Bonham and found analogs to specific guitar and keyboard tones in Led Zeppelin albums. [...] Nigel Williamson of The Times found similarities in Chris Robinson's voice on [...] "Come On" [...] to that of Robert Plant, and wrote that the song [...] "could almost be a Led ZeppelinII cast off." [...] Other reviewers noted similarities to Aerosmith; Howard Cohen of The Miami Herald called [...] "Lickin'" [...] "the best Aerosmith single that band hasn't recorded in years." [...] The perceived lack of originality, though, turned off some critics. The Herald Suns Andrew McUtchen inferred [...] "The Black Crowes are unaware it's no longer the '70s and after one listen to Lions ... it's clear someone should tell them." [...] Everett True of Playlouder concurred, writing [...] "It's blindingly obvious the Crowes are imitators, <b>and</b> <b>always</b> <b>will</b> be", though Elysa Gardner, writing for USA Today, recognized the band [...] "exhibit an energy and dexterity that compensate—at least somewhat—for their lack of invention." ...|$|E

David Thomson and directors Stanley Donen and Howard Hawks concurred that Grant was the greatest and most important actor {{in the history of the}} cinema. He was a favorite of Hitchcock, who admired him and called him [...] "the only actor I ever loved in my whole life", and remained one of Hollywood's top box-office attractions for almost 30 years. Wansell wrote: [...] "To millions of movie-goers around the world, Cary Grant will forever epitomize the glamour, and the style, of Hollywood in its golden years. With his dark hair, and even darker eyes, mischievous smile and effortless elegance, he was, is, <b>and</b> <b>always</b> <b>will</b> be indelibly one of the great movie stars.
