500|$|In the 1960s, right-wing populist {{individuals}} and groups with a paleoconservative worldview, such {{as members of the}} John Birch Society, were the first to combine and spread a business nationalist critique of corporate internationalists networked through think tanks such as the Council on Foreign Relations with a grand conspiracy theory casting them as front organizations for the Round Table of the [...] "Anglo-American Establishment", which are financed by an [...] "international banking cabal" [...] that has supposedly been plotting from the late 19th century on to impose an oligarchic new world order through a global financial system. <b>Anti-globalist</b> conspiracy theorists therefore fear that international bankers are planning to eventually subvert the independence of the U.S. by subordinating national sovereignty to a strengthened Bank for International Settlements.|$|E

50|$|Environmental {{economists and}} critics of globalized {{capitalism}} {{take issue with}} this theory {{for a number of}} reasons. Environmentalists disagree with Solow's conclusion about the role of technology because it neglects to consider the increases in exploitation of natural resources which may be responsible for much of the growth attributed to technology. <b>Anti-globalists</b> apply a similar argument, but tend to focus on exploitation of third world societies rather than the environment.|$|R
500|$|Claiming {{that the}} term [...] "New World Order" [...] is used by a secretive elite {{dedicated}} {{to the destruction of}} all national sovereignties, American writer Gary Allen—in his books None Dare Call It Conspiracy (1971), Rockefeller: Campaigning for the New World Order (1974), and [...] Say [...] "No!" [...] to the New World Order (1987)—articulated the <b>anti-globalist</b> theme of much current right-wing populist conspiracism in the US. Thus, after the fall of communism in the early 1990s, the main demonized scapegoat of the American far right shifted seamlessly from crypto-communists, who plotted on behalf of the Red Menace, to globalists, plotting on behalf of the New World Order. The relatively painless nature of the shift was due to growing right-wing populist opposition to corporate internationalism, but also in part to the basic underlying apocalyptic millenarian paradigm, which fed the Cold War (ca 1947-1991) and the witch-hunts of the McCarthy period (1950s).|$|E
500|$|Right-wing populist {{advocacy}} groups with a paleoconservative world-view, {{such as the}} John Birch Society, disseminated a multitude of conspiracy theories in the 1960s claiming that the governments of both the United States and the Soviet Union were controlled by a cabal of corporate internationalists, greedy bankers and corrupt politicians who were intent on using the U.N. as the vehicle to create a [...] "One World Government". This right-wing <b>anti-globalist</b> conspiracism fuelled the Bircher campaign for US withdrawal from the UN. American writer Mary M. Davison, in her 1966 booklet The Profound Revolution, traced the alleged New World Order conspiracy {{to the establishment of}} the US Federal Reserve in 1913 by international bankers, whom she claimed later formed the Council on Foreign Relations in 1921 as a shadow government. At the time the booklet was published, many readers would have interpreted [...] "international bankers" [...] as a reference to a postulated [...] "international Jewish banking conspiracy" [...] masterminded by the Rothschilds.|$|E

2500|$|Anti-globalization, or counter-globalization, {{consists}} {{of a number of}} criticisms of globalization but, in general, is critical of the globalization of corporate capitalism.

2500|$|Robert Wistrich, Professor of European and Jewish History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told Manfred Gerstenfeld that {{globalization}} {{has given rise}} to an <b>anti-globalist</b> left that is [...] "viscerally anti-American, anti-capitalist, and hostile to world Jewry." [...] He argues that the decade that preceded the current increase in antisemitism was one that saw accelerated globalization of the world economy, a process in which the losers included the Arab and Muslim worlds, and who are now the [...] "major consumers of anti-Jewish poison and conspiracy theories that blame everyone except themselves.

This is why a lot of them have or will become, willy-nilly, anti-Semites, not in the classical pre- 1945 sense, where hatred of Jews was often based on religion, but rather because they will see the Jewish community, who are almost uniformly supporters of Israel, as part - indeed in the forefront - of the enemy camp, and thus opposed to the "liberation" {{of the people}}s being crushed under the American heel...|$|R

2500|$|Except {{singular}} {{cases of}} homage {{on part of}} intransigent anti-Francoist Sivattistas the memory of Caylà went into oblivion; he started to figure prominently in the Carlist political discourse {{some time in the}} late 1960s. At that time the progressist supporters of , grouped around the young Carlist prince Carlos Hugo, launched their bid {{to take control of the}} movement. Their political vision was supported by an attempt to re-define Carlist history as popular social struggle, with genuine Carlists pitted against aristocratic, clerical and conservative aliens who infiltrated into the party; Caylà started to serve as an exemplary case of a genuine, tolerant, humanist, progressist, democratic, proto-socialist, anti-capitalist and popular Carlist. His second biography - also highly hagiographical, though pursuing the opposite vision than the earlier one - was published in 1997 and it fits [...] into this progressist outlook well; also some fiercely anti-capitalist, <b>anti-globalist</b> groupings of Spanish or Catalan extreme Left keep presenting Caylà as their predecessor. Other militantly Left-wing groups keep considering Cayla an enemy; carrer Tomàs Caylà is covered by a present-day initiative to purge Catalan public space of fascist heritage.

40|$|Canada {{has long}} been {{integrated}} into the international economy. Canada's history is one of seeking to reconcile the tensions between a staple economy, the opportunities provided by a border with the world's largest economy, and the requirements of nation building and national policy autonomy. These historical tensions are shown to be relevant in analysing the contemporary debates arising from the latest phase of globalisation. Two particular debates are analysed using the categories developed in the historical discussion. These two debates are those concerning {{the future of the}} Canadian dollar and that over the sources and implications of rising economic insecurity. For pro-globalists, Canadian interests are viewed as being best served by rapid integration into the continental and global economies. <b>Anti-globalists,</b> in contrast, regard such integration as undermining national institutions and policy autonomy...|$|R
50|$|As {{a liberal}} and {{advocate}} {{of the free market}} De Grauwe has long time been a strong proponent of the market economy and globalisation. In De onvoltooide globalisering (The Uncompleted Globalisation), written for a broader audience, he explains why he favors globalisation and discusses the statements of <b>anti-globalists,</b> which he finds somewhat pessimistic. He sees himself as an optimist and believes that market forces and economic growth will offer a solution to the issues related to natural resources, energy, environment and climate. However, De Grauwe has recently pointed out the necessity of government in this market economy. He said he used to uphold financial markets as bearers of the truth but now acknowledges that it is a world where rationality is intertwined with emotions. In an interview, he stated that certain entities are needed to correct market forces. Because of the global financial crisis, the need to correct the market is greater today than before. For this reason his acknowledgement of a strong government has increased.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the differences between}} hierarchical and network teams in emergency management. A controlled experimental environment was created in which we could study teams that differed in decision rights, availability of information, information sharing, and task division. Thirty-two teams of either two (network) or three (hierarchy) participants (N= 80 in total) received messages about an incident in a tunnel with high-ranking politicians possibly being present. Based on experimentally induced knowledge, teams had to decide as quickly and as accurately as possible what the likely cause of the incident was: an attack by Al Qaeda, by <b>anti-globalists,</b> or an accident. The results showed that network teams were overall faster and more accurate in difficult scenarios than hierarchical teams. Network teams also shared more knowledge in the difficult scenarios, compared with the easier scenarios. The advantage {{of being able to}} share information that is inherent in network teams is thus contingent upon the type of situation encountered. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the extent to}} which the anti-globalisation movement might contribute to a revival of labour politics. The starting point is an awareness that trade unions and <b>anti-globalists</b> do not necessarily see eye to eye so that any assumption that they can readily join forces becomes problematical. Four fault lines are identified in relation to key areas of concern: i) political alternatives; ii) participatory democracy; iii) organic cohesion and inclusion; and iv) the renewal of activism. It is pointed out that while - in the view of leading analysts in this field of inquiry - the anti-globalisation movement does indeed offer a potential source and impetus for a revitalisation, this is no tame option, especially in the context of labour corporatism. However, a sensible shift in the way in which the international trade union organisations have recently been approaching these issues may signal a repositioning of labour as a catalyst of solidarity.

40|$|Introducing and {{teaching}} globalization increasingly becomes {{a very sensitive}} issue of which most inhabitants of industrialized countries are hardly aware of. Though the negative side effects of present-day global capitalism are critical issues, there is another effect -as dangerous- concerning the way globalization is presented and taught both by pro-globalists and <b>anti-globalists.</b> Both sides like to present globalization as a “Western" phenomenon. <b>Anti-globalists</b> include it in their argument that everything that originates (and originated) in the so-called “West" is bad, while pro-globalists maintain that Western values and products are universal {{and that there are}} no substitutes. In doing so they both assume that there is indeed a concept like the “West", which can be identified, defined and described. Hardly any specialist on globalization has ever tried to do so but that did not seem to bother them. A recurrent argument is that the recent uprise of Islamist movements against the “West" proves that the “West" actually exists. What is not considered is the possibility that many movements against globalization actually derive from the continuous claim that principles considered as universal, like scientific and rational thought, economic behaviour, democracy, equality, freedom, etc., were of European origin and had no relationship with so-called non-Western civilizations like Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism or native-American cultures. Once people identify certain values as foreign or alien, even worse, if they link them to what they historically and psychologically perceive as the oppressor, then these values also come to represent the oppressor. The oppressor, who by then is no longer an oppressor, is surprised by the reaction from certain foreigners to “his" principles, which are basically well-meant. That is the core of the problem of present-day globalization, which seems to invite almost automatically phenomena like international terrorism, fundamentalism and nationalism. Reacting to these new phenomena the so-called “Westerner" not surprisingly increasingly chooses a similar nationalist party to vote for. There are two questions here to be answered. First, is there indeed a “West" from which all universal values and institutions originate from? Second, if this is not the case, what caused this phenomenon, and how do we correct it? Of course this leads us to an alternative way of presenting teaching globalization. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|For several decades, Transnational Corporations (TNCs) {{and many}} {{institutions}} collaborating with {{them have been}} the target of several negative or anticorporate campaigns by civil society actors including anti-corporate campaigners, anti-capitalists, <b>anti-globalists,</b> greens, and academics despite their seeming contribution to the development of society. However, the present decade has witnessed a new trend in the relationship between these TNCs and civil society actors – the development of collaborative relationships, the purpose of which appears to benefit business’s image more than society. This raises many related ethical questions on the true intentions and practices of these TNCs, the efficacy of their public relations machinery or campaigns and the positionality of the civil society actors. This paper attempts to answer these questions by examining the activities of an oil TNC, Shell, and its relationship with local communities in Nigeria. Particularly, attention is drawn to Shell’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes aimed at developing local communities of the Niger Delta area of Nigeria.
