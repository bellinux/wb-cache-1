Many of these had desperate wounds from the Malay creases, and two of them died a day or two afterwards. Conklin had been very badly cut about. None of the wounds ought to have been dangerous, but he had heated his blood by drink, and that in a hot climate is fatal, so we buried him ten days after the fight. Thus, you see, we lost two {{officers}} and thirteen men, and all for want of taking precautions. Of course we sailed at once for Calcutta, and luckily had fine weather on the way; we should have fared badly with but half a crew had we fallen in with a hurricane. Pearson was a good navigator, and, after taking six more hands on board at Calcutta, he brought her home safely. The owners made us both handsome presents, and the next voyage he sailed as first mate and I as second. So it turned out a lucky stroke for both of us. Three years later he went as captain, and a year afterwards I sailed as his first mate.” ...|$|E

30|$|Despite {{correction}} {{for patient}} case mix (i.e., identified risk factors), this analysis model still inevitably yields flagging of surgeons with average clinical performance. This {{is due to}} the sensitivity of the model. If the CUSUM analysis has to identify derailing performance (OR 2 compared to average performance) in surgeons within a reasonable number of procedures (i.e., 20 laparoscopic hysterectomies), occasional flagging of surgeons with average clinical performance is inevitable. These proposed cutoff limits are set primarily to identify possible suboptimal situations and to enhance patient safety. The goal is twofold. Firstly, by <b>alarming</b> <b>out</b> of control limits in a timely fashion, the surgeon can evaluate his/her performance as well as of its surgical team and even its equipment and act if necessary. Secondly, by providing (national) averages as a standard of care, hypothetically at long-term, also suboptimal performing surgeons that do not cross the out-of-control line will improve their outcomes.|$|R

40|$|A new Internet {{datamining}} {{framework is}} developed to protect critical information infrastructures. Frequent episode rules are generated to detect anomalies in TCP, UDP, or ICMP connections. We protect network-based computing infrastructures such as clusters, Grids, and P 2 P systems. Fundamental rule pruning techniques {{are introduced to}} significantly reduce the rule-search space. The new security system was tested over real-life Internet trace data at the University of Southern California. Our experimental results show a 51 % improvement in detection rate on DoS, R 2 L, and port-scanning attacks, compared with the results using association rules in Internet traffic datamining. We experienced less than 20 false <b>alarms</b> <b>out</b> of 200 unknown network attacks. Our scheme detects many novel attacks that cannot be detected by Snort. These experimental results demonstrate significant security upgrade and performance gains over existing security systems for Internet computing, Grid and web services.

40|$|Novelty {{detection}} in {{the machine}} learning context refers to identifying unknown/novel data, i. e., data which vary greatly from the ones that the system was trained with. This paper explores this technique as applied to acoustic surveillance of abnormal situations. The ultimate goal {{of the system is}} to help an authorized person towards taking the appropriate actions for preventing life/property loss. A wide variety of acoustic parameters is employed towards forming a multidomain feature vector, which captures diverse characteristics of the audio signals. Subsequently the feature coefficients are fed to three probabilistic novelty detection methodologies. Their performance is computed using two measures which take into account misdetections and false <b>alarms.</b> <b>Out</b> dataset was recorded under real-world conditions including three different locations where various types of normal and abnormal sound events were captured. A smart-home environment, an open public space, and an office corridor were used. The results indicate that probabilistic novelty detection can provide an accurate analysis of the audio scene to identify abnormal events. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
