500|$|As the world's {{worst in}} a 2004 report on {{countries}} with poor earthquake engineering, Iran is especially prone to earthquakes. In addition, poor construction practice has exacerbated death tolls; 1 in 3,000 Iranians has {{died in an}} earthquake-related incident. Roger Bilham, {{a professor at the}} University of Colorado declared that [...] "Most of Iran needs rebuilding. If the population of Iran had a choice between spending oil revenues on munitions or houses that won't kill them, I suspect they would choose a safe home. It's <b>all</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of earthquake education." [...] The United Nations developed a Common Country Assessment for Iran, stating, [...] "While adequate building regulations exist for large cities, it is generally believed that they are not rigorously adhered to... most of those who have suffered in recent major earthquakes have lived in small towns and villages. Earthquake-proof construction is very rare in those areas and adequate building regulations are not yet in place".|$|E
500|$|Adams {{began to}} make the drills far more {{intricate}} and precise {{than they had been}} in the past by adding a countermarch, maneuvers from the Army Drill Manual, and established a 30-inch (76cm) step, or sixsteps for every fiveyards (4.57m), as the band standard. Adams also added the criss-cross maneuver. First performed November 27, 1947 at the annual Thanksgiving Day game with the University of Texas, the criss-cross maneuver and its later variations became the band's most anticipated maneuver. Other band directors said it was impossible to do because it required two people {{to be in the same}} place at the same time (indeed, to this day computer programs that chart band formations say that this maneuver cannot be performed). To accomplish this, band members step between each other's feet. In later years, people who did not know that the maneuver was first done in 1947 claimed that the drill was designed by a computer. Adams explained, [...] "It's <b>all</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of mathematics. One man can take up only a certain amount of space at one time and moves in one direction at a predictable rate of speed." ...|$|E

[...] It was <b>all</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of signals, said the clever civilian theorist in Washington. [...] "We won't bomb the SAM sites, which signals to North Vietnam not to use them." [...] But our enemies were not playing Washington's silly games. A month later the United States lost its first aircraft to a SAM.|$|E

2500|$|In a Washington Post profile a {{few months}} after the September trip, Bronfman laid out what he thought had been {{accomplished}} during his September meetings. He said, [...] "There's going to be a buildup of pressure through the business community. The Russians know the Soviet Jewry issue is tied to trade ... My guess is that over a period of time, five to ten years, some of our goals will be achieved." [...] Author Gal Beckerman says in his When They Come For Us We'll Be Gone, [...] "Bronfman had a business man's understanding of the Soviet Jewish issue. It was <b>all</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of negotiation, of calculating what the Russians really wanted and leveraging that against emigration." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{official}} {{end of the}} French protectorate and a lesser role recognized by the ruling authority in Palestine, France was not inclined to diminish its influence in the region. Dominique Trimbur wrote [...] "Paris and its representatives acted as if France still occupied the place of protective power which it {{had at the time}} of the Ottoman Empire." [...] France sought to restore its traditional role in Palestine, to protect the Catholic communities. Dominique Trimbur stresses the role of Amédée Outrey, Consul General of France in Jerusalem from 1938 to 194, in restoring the status quo: [...] "for him, it (was) first of <b>all</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of serving as the arbitrator of the communities and of avoiding absolutely any British interference in their affairs." [...] Through the restoration of buildings (Abbey of Abu Ghosh), maneuvers to have posts of responsibility appointed to French people, and the attribution of medals to the directors of seminars devoted to France, Outrée tried to restore France's historic dominance.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to its geological threat, Iran has poor earthquake engineering. In a 2004 report by ScienceDaily, it was listed as [...] "the worst offender" [...] globally for poor earthquake engineering. [...] Professor Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado at Boulder, a geophysicist who specializes in earthquake-related deformation and hazards, blames construction practices {{for the fact that}} {{since the start of the}} 20th century, 1 in 3,000 Iranians has died in an earthquake-related incident. Bilham adds, [...] "Most of Iran needs rebuilding. If the population of Iran had a choice between spending oil revenues on munitions or houses that won't kill them, I suspect they would choose a safe home. It's <b>all</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of earthquake education." [...] A Common Country Assessment by The United Nations for Iran has similar results, stating that, [...] "While adequate building regulations exist for large cities, it is generally believed that they are not rigorously adhered to... most of those who have suffered in recent major earthquakes have lived in small towns and villages. Earthquake-proof construction is very rare in those areas and adequate building regulations are not yet in place".|$|E

2500|$|I am {{often asked}} how I went about writing an opera for television, {{and what are}} the {{specific}} problems that I had to face in planning a work for such a medium. I must confess that in writing [...] "Amahl and the Night Visitors," [...] I hardly thought of television at <b>all.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of fact, <b>all</b> my operas are originally conceived for an ideal stage which has no equivalent in reality, and I believe that such is the case with most dramatic authors. —Gian-Carlo Menotti ...|$|R
2500|$|Through {{his works}} Justin Chin worked to {{give voice to}} marginalized groups of racial, {{national}} or sexual minorities. He questioned the usefulness of categories and language by acknowledging that [...] "men and women, white people and people of color, straight people and LGBT people, lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and trans persons do not sound the same. We are not homogenous." [...] In the same Mongrel: Essays, Diatribes + Pranks he also questions identities as he writes: [...] "I’ve given up {{the dream of the}} Queer Nation. Race, class, gender, ideologies, and values will always divide us[...] [...] [...] I am so over being queer these days, and I don’t care what I call myself these days or what anyone else calls me; it’s <b>all</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of convenience these days." [...] In this way he used his writings to problematize the dominant language and naming by not purely accepting it but rather problematizing it as a [...] "matter of convenience". When thinking of Justin Chin problematizing and critique were some of the core goals of his writings. In an interview with Gerry Gomez Pearlberg for Frigate ’zine, Chin said, “Every work of art that works as art is a critique.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Spanbauer {{moved to}} New York City in 1983 {{and entered the}} Columbia University Writing Program. Spanbauer {{took a job as}} an {{apartment}} building supervisor in the East Village, and began abusing alcohol and taking cocaine. He began writing The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon in 1987, and by 1988 was deep into the manuscript. [...] The writing process was a very difficult one for Spanbauer. [...] He had so little money that he lived like [...] "a subway rat, pale and frail, trying hard to believe in" [...] the novel he was writing. He later said, [...] "A lot of the stuff I came up with was pretty fearsome, facing some personal devils head-on. I couldn't distinguish between the world and the book. At one point, I was so stressed out, I passed out in Penn Station." [...] As he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer after the book's publication, [...] "It's <b>all</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of trust. You're {{right in the middle of}} this story. [...] You don't know the end of it. It's this preposterous tale about these preposterous people, and you don't know what's going to happen next, and you're tired of eating chicken livers and fettuccine, and you're alone in this little square concrete apartment, there's no air or earth, and pretty soon it was hard for me to distinguish what was going on in my head and what was going on on the outside." [...] The book took four and a half years and seven revisions to complete.|$|E
