5|$|As part of William III and Mary II's {{coronation}} honours, Churchill {{was created}} Earl of Marlborough on 9 April 1689 (O.S.); {{he was also}} sworn {{as a member of}} the Privy Council and made a Gentleman of the King's Bedchamber. His elevation, however, led to accusatory rumours from King James's supporters that Marlborough had disgracefully betrayed his erstwhile king for personal gain; William himself entertained reservations about the man who had deserted James. Marlborough's apologists though, including his most notable descendant and biographer Winston Churchill, have been <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> to attribute patriotic, religious, and moral motives to his action; but in the words of Chandler, it is difficult to absolve Marlborough of ruthlessness, ingratitude, intrigue and treachery against a man to whom he owed virtually everything in his life and career to date.|$|E

40|$|M. Tech. (Chiropractic) There is {{research}} {{to show that}} ischaemic compression is very effective {{in the treatment of}} myofascial trigger points (MFTP’s). It is less invasive when compared to other treatment methods such as dry needling however; according to Gulick (2010) {{there is a lack of}} randomised controlled studies with regard to standard ischaemic compression treatment protocols. This includes the appropriate amount of pressure, duration of compression or frequency of treatment (Gulick, 2010). This study was conducted in order to determine whether ischaemic compression that is applied <b>at</b> <b>pain</b> threshold would have a similar effect when compared to ischaemic compression <b>at</b> <b>pain</b> tolerance in the treatment of active rhomboid major and minor myofascial trigger points, using a hand held algometer. This study was specifically undertaken to provide more information regarding the most effective method of ischaemic compression with regard to the amount of pressure that is most suitable during treatment. The results of this study could potentially improve patient comfort and reduce pain during treatment by showing that treatment <b>at</b> <b>pain</b> threshold may be as effective as conventional ischaemic compression <b>at</b> <b>pain</b> tolerance. It was hypothesized that ischaemic compression applied <b>at</b> <b>pain</b> threshold may have a similar effect as application <b>at</b> <b>pain</b> tolerance by having a positive outcome on the subjective and objective findings in patients with active myofascial trigger points of the rhomboid major and minor muscles. Participants were recruited into the study by word of mouth as well as with the use of advertisements that were placed around the University of Johannesburg Doornfontein campus and clinic. Thirty participants that conformed to the specified limitations and diagnostic criteria were accepted to partake in this study. The participants were then placed in a random and stratified manner into two groups of 15, based on age and gender. Group A received ischaemic compression of the rhomboid major and minor muscles <b>at</b> <b>pain</b> threshold while Group B received ischaemic compression of the same muscles <b>at</b> <b>pain</b> tolerance. Ischaemic compression was administered over a 30 second duration. Each participant received 2 treatments a week for 3 weeks while a 7 th and final visit served only for measurement taking...|$|R

25|$|With stylometric {{approaches}} it {{is possible}} to identify certain characteristics which are very typical of Shakespeare, {{such as the use of}} particular poetic techniques or the frequency with which various common words are used, and these have been used to argue that Marlowe could not have written Shakespeare's works. In every case so far where these data have been plotted over time, however, Marlowe's corpus has been found to fit just where Shakespeare's would have been, had he written anything before the early 1590s as all of Marlowe's were. On the other hand, whereas stylometry might be useful in discerning where two sets of work are not by the same person, it can be used with less confidence to show that they are. This was something that T.C. Mendenhall, whose work some Marlovians have nevertheless thought proves their theory, was <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> to point out.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether nocturnal <b>pain</b> and <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> rest preoperatively influence the satisfaction in patients after joint arthroplasty. The second research question is whether subjective outcome (VAS/WOMAC) after hip (THA) or knee arthroplasty (TKA) differs in patients with or without nocturnal <b>pain</b> and <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> rest preoperatively compared to those who do not. METHODS: A consecutive group of 189 TKAs and 189 THAs was evaluated. The influence of <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> rest and nocturnal pain preoperatively on the outcome was evaluated by means of a one-way ANOVA. Outcome measurements used were WOMAC, VAS pain and VAS Satisfaction. RESULTS: The results show that satisfaction at follow up was not influenced by the presence of nocturnal <b>pain</b> or <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> rest preoperatively. The presence of nocturnal <b>pain</b> and <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> rest preoperatively did result in a poorer WOMAC pain score WOMAC physical impairment score and a higher VAS <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> rest and activity after surgery for both THA and TKA. CONCLUSION: The results show that the presence of <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> night and <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> rest in symptomatic osteoarthritic patients results in worse VAS and WOMAC scores, but with similar amounts of satisfaction at follow up.

500|$|Conway {{described}} the panel as indicating [...] "an astonishing depth of psychological insight" [...] {{for an artist}} not yet 20 years old. In its simple design and detail it shares many of the characteristics of, and is a key precursor to, Dürer's mature work. He [...] portrayed his father again in 1497, when the older man would have been around 70. He has aged noticeably in the intervening seven years: his skin is saggier, the wrinkles deeper and more pronounced. In this later portrait Dürer seems <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> to convey these effects of ageing, which are all too evident on his father's face. According to Brion, his eyes have lost their [...] "distant, mystic" [...] appearance and now seem less contented. Conway agrees, seeing traces of haggardly agitation, but holds that the two paintings convey a similar overall highly favourable and compassionate impression of the man.|$|E
500|$|After Jinnah died, {{his sister}} Fatima {{asked the court}} to execute Jinnah's will under Shia Islamic law. This {{subsequently}} became the part of the argument in Pakistan about Jinnah's religious affiliation. Vali Nasr says Jinnah [...] "was an Ismaili by birth and a Twelver Shia by confession, though not a religiously observant man." [...] In a 1970 legal challenge, Hussain Ali Ganji Walji claimed Jinnah had converted to Sunni Islam. Witness Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada stated in court that Jinnah converted to Sunni Islam in 1901 when his sisters married Sunnis. In 1970, Liaquat Ali Khan and Fatima Jinnah's joint affidavit that Jinnah was Shia was rejected. But in 1976 the court rejected Walji's claim that Jinnah was Sunni; effectively accepting him as a Shia. In 1984 a high court bench reversed the 1976 verdict and maintained that [...] "the Quaid was definitely not a Shia", which suggested that Jinnah was Sunni. According to the journalist Khaled Ahmed, Jinnah publicly had a non-sectarian stance and [...] "was <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> to gather the Muslims of India under the banner of a general Muslim faith and not under a divisive sectarian identity." [...] Liaquat H. Merchant, Jinnah's grandnephew, writes that [...] "the Quaid was not a Shia; he was also not a Sunni, he was simply a Muslim". An eminent lawyer who practised in the Bombay High Court until 1940 testified that Jinnah used to pray as an orthodox Sunni. According to Akbar Ahmed, Jinnah became a firm Sunni Muslim {{by the end of his}} life.|$|E
500|$|By 1952, Kenyatta {{was widely}} {{recognised}} {{as a national}} leader, both by his supporters and his opponents. As KAU leader, he was <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> to oppose all illegal activity, including workers' strikes. He called on his supporters to work hard, and to abandon laziness, theft, and crime. He also insisted that in an independent Kenya, all racial groups would be safeguarded. Kenyatta's gradualist and peaceful approach contrasted {{with the growth of}} the Mau Mau Uprising, as armed guerrilla groups began targeting the white minority and members of the Kikuyu community who did not support them. By 1959, the Mau Mau had killed around 1,880 people. For many young Mau Mau militants, Kenyatta was regarded as a hero. In April 1952, Kenyatta began a speaking tour in which he denounced the Mau Mau to assembled crowds, insisting that independence must be achieved through peaceful means. In August he attended a much publicised mass meeting in Kiambu where—in front of 30,000 people—he said that [...] "Mau Mau has spoiled the country. Let Mau Mau perish for ever. All people should search for Mau Mau and kill it." [...] Despite Kenyatta's vocal opposition to the Mau Mau, KAU had moved towards a position of greater militancy. At its 1951 AGM, more militant African nationalists had taken senior positions and the party officially announced its call for Kenyan independence within three years. In January 1952, KAU members formed a secret Central Committee devoted to direct action, formulated along a cell structure. Whatever Kenyatta's views on these developments, he had little ability to control them.|$|E
40|$|Background: Chronic wounds {{are managed}} {{almost entirely by}} {{community}} nurses. Almost all individuals with leg ulcers report acute pain usually related to dressing change. Little is known about pain after healing. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore the course of pain from baseline to time of healing of leg ulcers (venous or mixed etiology). In order to understand this phenomenon and develop implications for nursing practice, objectives included: 1) Measure incidence and prevalence of <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> baseline and healing; 2) Describe characteristics associated with leg ulcer <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> baseline; 3) Identify predictors of leg ulcer <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> healing. Methods: Data were from one randomized controlled trial (2004 - 2008) of 424 individuals with leg ulcers in the community receiving evidence-informed nursing management. The primary outcome was <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> the time of healing. Predictive factors included demographic, circumstance of living, clinical and ulcer characteristics. Multivariable logistic regression identified the subset of predictors of <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> healing. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) are reported. Results: Eighty-two percent of participants reported <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> baseline and 32 % at healing. Five percent with no <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> baseline reported <b>pain</b> <b>at</b> healing.

500|$|His last book, The Great Galilean, {{has been}} characterised by one biographer as Keable's attempt [...] "to renconcile {{his love of}} Jesus with his failure to believe in him as a God." [...] The book sought to {{distinguish}} the [...] "historical Jesus" [...] of record from the [...] "traditional Jesus" [...] of church worship. The historical Jesus, Keable said, was so poorly known that there survived too little information for a three-line obituary. Instead, the figure that Christians worshipped was a [...] "traditional Jesus", recorded in the Gospels from an oral tradition that was not really biographical. This [...] "traditional Jesus" [...] became a [...] "literary Jesus", the central figure of the four gospels, and it is on this figure – quite distinct from the actual, historical Jesus – that the contemporary church centred. Keable sought to criticise the attitude in the contemporary church toward [...] "traditional Jesus", given {{how much of the}} rest of [...] "traditional" [...] religion Protestantism had discarded. However, Keable was <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> to stress that the [...] "traditional" [...] Jesus should not be seen as an , or something to be discarded. The ahistoricity of the traditional Jesus, he said, should not be a reason to leave the church. Without this traditional Jesus, he predicted, Western civilisation would fade and fall. He was, then, critical of the specific ways in which the contemporary church construed Jesus, in its attempts to conflate the traditional Jesus with historical Jesus, which Keable considered impossible. He blamed these actions of the church for the declining numbers of worshippers, and accused it of draining Christianity of profundity by relying too heavily on rationalism and rigid structure.|$|E
