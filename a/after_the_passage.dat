5|$|In {{response}} to the flooding in St. John's, Newfoundland, the city mayor activated the city's Emergency Preparedness Program. On September 27, about a week <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of the storm, the Emergency Measures Organization began accepting applications for flood-related damage. By {{about a month after}} the storm, 169 applications were processed, with an additional 1,762 received by the Emergency Measures Organization. Eligibility for the disaster assistance included restoration to property or household items of an essential nature. A few days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of the storm, the government of Newfoundland appealed to the federal government for federal disaster relief fund; the government later approved. Ultimately, disaster relief assistance totaled $6.3million (2001 CAD), primarily to individual assistance.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the results of}} changes in soil compaction <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> of combine harvester. The research was done on the maize-stubble; the soil was the mold formed in the sand. The measured parameter was a penetration of resistance in range of depth 0 – 60 cm. The measurements were done in <b>the</b> ruts <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> <b>the</b> front and rear wheel of combine harvester. During the experiment two levels of vertical load of wheels were applied – these levels were dependent on filling of grain tank of harvester. Moreover, {{the influence of the}} lateral tilt of harvester on the soil compaction was analyzed (the harvester was equipped with the leveling system which allowed to obtain the tilt). The obtained results shows that the increase in vertical load caused greater compaction in ruts. Furthermore, it was found that <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of tilted harvester caused lower compaction than the harvester without tilt...|$|R

By August28, 150,000civilians and 10,000soldiers were fighting against flooding along the Liao River on a daily basis. Additionally, local military forces were called in to assist relief workers. The government organized buses and boats to carry flood victims. Some schools were used as shelter while restaurants and hospitals sent food and medicine.|$|E
5|$|By {{about a week}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of the hurricane, President George W.

The disaster declaration allocated the use of federal funds for rebuilding and providing aid in the aftermath of hurricane Isabel. By about four months <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of the hurricane, disaster aid totaled about $516million (2003USD, $ USD), primarily in North Carolina and Virginia. Over 166,000 residents applied for individual assistance, with about $117million (2003USD, $ USD) approved for residents to assist with temporary housing and home repairs. About 50,000business owners applied for Small Business Administration loans, with about $178million (2003USD, $ USD) approved for the assistance loans. About 40,000people visited local disaster recovery centers, designed to provide additional information regarding the aftermath of the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Twenty-fourhours <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of the hurricane, {{workers had}} {{restored}} power to 70% {{of the affected}} residents in Sinaloa, and by six days after the storm, electrical service was completely restored. The damage to the federal highway between Culiacán and Los Mochis along the coastal region of Sinaloa was restored about 48hours <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of the hurricane. The rehabilitation of the agricultural infrastructure began immediately, {{and most of the}} drainage networks were repaired by about two weeks after the hurricane. About half of the damaged railways were repaired by about a month after the storm. The total cost for reconstruction and aid amounted to about $18.5million (1998USD, 175million 1998MXN, $23.3million 2007USD), about 94% from federal funds and the rest from state funding. A portion of the funding was allocated to assist the reconstruction of destroyed houses.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of the cyclone, the Iran {{chapter of}} the Red Cross and its volunteers worked in {{conjunction}} with the military to distribute relief supplies to villages using trucks and helicopters.

In total, 61,558families received aid from the Red Cross in Iran. The Iranian government provided monetary relief to the affected people. Officials worked to restore roads, bridges, and power systems in the affected areas, although repairs were more difficult in some locations; by a week after the storm, several villages remained surrounded by floodwaters.|$|E

The New Zealand government provided about $80million (1988NZD) {{to the east}} coast region of the North Island for assisting in cyclone damage. $8million was used to create an East Coast Forestry Conservation Scheme, which was set to protect forests and prevent erosion. A study was taken {{five years after the}} storm, consisting of a group of 112people who were evacuated or received monetary assistance in response to the cyclone; the study showed 12% of the respondents as experiencing Posttraumatic stress disorder, of which they reported a general lack of assistance and public support.|$|E

5|$|During the Industrial Revolution in Europe, {{demand for}} {{alkaline}} substances increased. A new industrial process developed by Nicolas Leblanc of Issoundun, France enabled cheap large-scale production of sodium carbonate (soda ash).

Until the British Alkali Act 1863 and similar legislation in other countries, the excess HCl was vented into the air. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of the act, soda ash producers were obliged to absorb the waste gas in water, producing hydrochloric acid on an industrial scale.|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the data from the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System, 1444 {{infectious}} bronchitis (IB) cases were diagnosed between 1997 and 2012. Epidemiologic analyses demonstrated two major IB virus (IBV) outbreak peaks, affecting mainly 35 -to- 49 -day-old broiler chickens. California variant 1737 (CA 1737) and California variant 1999 (Cal 99) IBV types were the most prevalent genotypes during the analyzed period. To further understand the increased prevalence of these genotypes, we assessed and compared the variability of the S 1 gene hypervariable region of CA 1737 and Cal 99 with the variability of IBV strains belonging to the Massachusetts 41 (M 41) and Arkansas (Ark) types during serial passages in embryonated chicken eggs. On {{the basis of}} the S 1 nonsynonymous changes, seven different subpopulations were detected in M 41. However, the predominant population of the field strain M 41 before passages continued to be predominant throughout the experiment. In contrast, Ark <b>passaging</b> resulted in <b>the</b> detection of 13 different subpopulations, and the field sequence became extinct <b>after</b> <b>the</b> first <b>passage.</b> In IBV Cal 99, eight different subpopulations were detected; one of these became predominant <b>after</b> <b>the</b> second <b>passage.</b> In CA 1737, 10 different subpopulations were detected. The field strain major sequence was not detected <b>after</b> <b>the</b> first <b>passage</b> but reappeared <b>after</b> <b>the</b> second <b>passage</b> and remained at low levels throughout the experiment.

The court found liability but indicated it would not award pre-judgment interest, and the Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari. Warren negotiated a $5M settlement. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of the Indian Claims Commission Act, the same group of tribes struggled to bring a single action for recovery under the broader claims allowed under the ICCA, which settled for $29M.|$|E
5|$|Isa first {{affected}} Pohnpei as {{a tropical}} storm on April 12. While passing near the island, the storm produced moderate winds across the island, peaking at 95km/h (60mph). The winds downed several trees and tree limbs which destroyed 40% of the island's power lines. A few buildings reported roof damage. About 15% of the crops on Pohnpei were damaged, including losses to the banana and breadfruit crops. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of the typhoon, President of the Federated States of Micronesia Jacob Nena declared Pohnpei as a major disaster area due to the damage from Typhoon Isa and subsequent flooding; on April 20 heavy rainfall caused widespread mudslides and 19fatalities on the island, though they were not related to Isa.|$|E
