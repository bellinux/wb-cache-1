5|$|As the show's revenue {{continued}} to rise through syndication and DVD sales, the main cast stopped appearing for script readings in April 2004.

40|$|Dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP 4) enzyme {{inhibition}} {{has been reported}} to increase plasma glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) level for controlling postprandial glucose concentration. A prominent GLP- 1 level in DPP 4 -deficient rats contributed to the resistance of endotoxemia and myocardial infarction. DPP 4 deficiency also increased the capability against H 2 O 2 -induced stress in cardiomyocyte. However, long term effect of loss DPP 4 activity on cardiac performance remained unclear. We used abdominal aortic banding (AAB) to induce pressure overload in wild-type and DPP 4 -deficient rats, and investigated the progression of heart failure. Cardiac histology and function were determined. Blood sample was collected for the plasma biochemical marker measurement. Heart weight to body weight ratio increased 1. 2 -fold <b>after</b> 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> AAB surgery. Cardiac function was compensated against pressure overload <b>after</b> 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> AAB surgery, but progressed to deterioration <b>after</b> 10 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> AAB surgery. AAB induced cardiac dysfunction was alleviated in DPP 4 -deficient rats. DPP 4 activity increased significantly in wild-type rats <b>after</b> 10 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> AAB surgery, but remained unchanged in DPP 4 -deficient rats. In contrast, GLP- 1 concentration was elevated by AAB <b>after</b> 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> surgery in DPP 4 -deficient rats, and remained high <b>after</b> 10 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> surgery. Ang II level markedly increased <b>after</b> 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> AAB surgery, but were less in DPP 4 -deficient rats. Massive collagen deposits in wild-type rat hearts appeared <b>after</b> 10 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> AAB surgery, which were alleviated in DPP 4 -deficient rats. Long term deficiency of DPP 4 activity improved cardiac performance against pressure overload in rat, which may be attributed to a great quantity of GLP- 1 accumulation during AAB...|$|R

5|$|Calling {{themselves}} T2 Productions, James and co-producers Stephanie Austin and B.J. Rack rented {{an office}} in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, before starting to assemble the crew for Terminator 2. Adam Greenberg, who worked on The Terminator and Ghost (1990), became director of photography, while Joseph Nemec III, {{who had worked with}} Cameron on The Abyss, was tasked with production design. The team conducted a national search for a steel mill suitable for the film's climax, eventually selecting a dormant mill in Fontana, California, <b>after</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> negotiations. Locating a potential Cyberdyne building was more difficult, as the site was to host numerous stunts, shootouts, and explosions. An industrial park in Fremont, California, was eventually rented {{for the duration of the}} film's production. Cameron and William Wisher completed the 140-page screenplay draft on May 10, 1990, and by July 15, the first shooting draft had been distributed to the cast and crew; particulars of the technically detailed scripts were shrouded in secrecy. Both the six-week turnaround for the script and the film's accelerated production schedule were to enable a 1991 Fourth of July release.|$|E

They were supported by 86 land guns and 35,000 Spanish and French troops (7,000–8,000 French) on land intending to assault the fortifications once they had been demolished. The 138 guns opened fire from floating batteries in the Bay and the 86 guns on the land side, directed on the fortifications <b>after</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> preparatory artillery fire. But the garrison replied with red-hot shot to set fire to and sink the attacker's floating batteries and warships in the Bay. The British destroyed three of the floating batteries, which blew up as the 'red-hot shot' did its job. The other seven batteries were scuttled by the Spanish. In addition 719 men on board the ships (many of whom drowned) were casualties.|$|E

5|$|The Danish sloop Jordenxiold {{was intercepted}} off Isla Palominos on September 3, 1824, as she {{completed}} a voyage from Saint Thomas to Fajardo; the pirates stole goods and cash from the passengers. The incident {{attracted the attention}} of the Danish government, which commissioned the Santa Cruz (a 16-gun brigantine commanded by Michael Klariman) to monitor the areas off Vieques and Culebra. On September 8–9 a hurricane, Nuestra Señora de la Monserrate, struck southern Puerto Rico and passed directly over the Mona Passage. Cofresí and his crew were caught in the storm, which drove their ship towards Hispaniola. According to historian Enrique Ramírez Brau, an expedition weeks later by Fajardo commander Ramón Aboy to search Vieques, Culebra and the Windward Islands for pirates was actually after Cofresí.
