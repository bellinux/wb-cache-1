5|$|The not-guilty verdict led to {{widespread}} dismay, and, as a result, the U.S. Congress and <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>states</b> rewrote laws regarding the insanity defense. The old Model Penal Code test {{was replaced by}} a test that shifts the burden of proof regarding a defendant's sanity from the prosecution to the defendant. Three states have abolished the defense altogether.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all members}} of the Council are members of a {{political}} party at national level, and most of these are members of a European-level political party. However the Council is composed to represent the EU's states rather than political parties and the nature of coalition governments in <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>states</b> means that individual configurations would vary on which domestic party was assigned the portfolio. However the broad ideological alignment of each state does have a bearing {{on the nature of the}} law the Council produces and the extent to which the link between domestic parties puts pressure on the members in the European Parliament to vote a certain way.|$|E

25|$|Proponents of the FMA {{initially}} {{argued that}} {{if it were not for}} judicial overreach, there would be no need for an FMA; states' rights would not be violated since no state legislatures had recognized same-sex marriage.

25|$|Savings and Loans {{gained a}} wide range of new {{investment}} powers {{with the passage of the}} Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act and the Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act. <b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>states</b> also passed legislation that similarly increased investment options.

In many instances management lacked the ability or experience to evaluate them, or to administer large volumes of nonresidential construction loans.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>states</b> {{are less}} {{integrated}} into the EU than others. In most cases this is because those states have gained an opt-out from a certain policy area.

Most states outside the Eurozone are obliged to adopt the euro when they are ready, but Denmark and the United Kingdom have obtained the right to retain their own independent currencies.|$|E

25|$|Although the DipScam {{operation}} in the 1980s led {{to a decline in}} diploma mill activity across the United States, the lack of further action by law enforcement, uneven state laws, {{and the rise of the}} Internet have combined to reverse many of the gains made in previous years. In 2005, the US Department of Education launched its Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs website to combat the spread of fraudulent degrees. <b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>states</b> have passed bills restricting the ability of organizations to award degrees without accreditation.|$|E
