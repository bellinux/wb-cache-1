2500|$|When Mrs. Rodenhurst {{told me of}} {{the advent}} to Shrewsbury of Wainwright, I asked her {{if he was in}} his room, or where. 'No,' she said, 'he went out <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b> I think you'll find him in the King's Arms.' I went to the King's Arms and made my very first {{appearance}} in the bar-parlour of a public-house. The room was empty save for one man, dressed in blue serge, with a shrewd lean face. I recognised him. I had seen him playing for Yorkshire at Old Trafford. I introduced myself. 'I'm the assistant pro.,' I explained. 'Art thou?' he replied, 'well, then 'ave a drink wi' me.' I told him I didn't drink — only ginger ale. 'Christ,' he said, 'tha'rt a reight bloody cricketer.' He was a tall man, who walked as though he didn't care a damn for anybody. There was something sinister about him. Every night he got drunk as a matter of course, quietly and masterfully. One day he backed a winner at a glorious price, and towards eleven o'clock that night he and the drill-sergeant of the school arrived arm-in-arm (supporting one another) in the sitting-room of our lodgings. Very gravely Ted introduced me to the drill-sergeant, whom of course I knew very well. The drill-sergeant as gravely introduced Ted to me, then taking my arm, he whispered rather noisily in my ear, 'I'm 'fraid 'e's a l'il drunk, so I've jus' bror him h-home.' Whereupon Ted dissolved into helpless laughter and said, 'My dear sersergeant, don't be 'diculous[...] [...] [...] Bror me home? Why, you ole fool, it's me that's bror you 'ome.' Then (aside), 'E's jus' a l'il drunk, so I've bror him home.' The sergeant hooted with glee. 'Bless m' soul,' he said, 'Ted; jus' lis'en t'me. If you'd bror me home, this would be my lodgin's, see? I would be 'ome, not you. See? But this is your lodgin's—so I mus' 'ave bror you 'ome. See?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I understood," [...] the new-comer replied imperturbably. [...] "I called <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> {{and took}} the liberty of {{awaiting}} your return." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “The time seemed long,” she {{answered}} evasively. “An empty coupé {{came to the}} door <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago</b> and it’s still waiting,” she added, looking at me inquisitively.|$|E
60|$|Cecily. Your brother Ernest. He arrived <b>about</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "He went to Wexbridge <b>about</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> his ma said. She said she'd {{tell him}} to come right over {{as soon as he}} kem home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I showed myself <b>about</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> sir. You said I {{might take}} my liberty again {{as soon as}} Lady Glyde had gone away to London." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I {{was down}} at the {{railroad}} station <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> and I saw a train come in from Chicago with Tom Roland and Jasper Guardley on board." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{sent for}} me, Mr. Holmes. I had your note <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> and I have come, though I {{really do not}} know why I should obey your summons." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{you do not}} know," [...] said Mr. Moss. And {{he looked}} at her exactly as he had looked <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> when he was making love to her as Trullo's betrothed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! the girls--what girls? Well, {{they must}} answer for themselves; I left them <b>about</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> {{and now you}} hear their voices in the porch." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{glanced at}} the {{timepiece}} on the overmantel. [...] "It would be <b>about</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b> It was <b>a</b> few minutes before the Rennes diligence passed through." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She came {{tearing down}} to the mill, bare-backed on our half-broken mustang, <b>about</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> to call me 'to help you,'" [...] {{explained}} Bradley. [...] "Heaven knows how she managed to do it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why then, if that be your quarry, you are but wasting time. Such a party passed {{us at the}} gallop <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b> It {{would be}} an hour, would it not, Giacopo?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. The {{woman who}} came to the door told me he had left <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b> He is going to sail on the Princess Lenida for Liverpool either this {{afternoon}} or to-morrow morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} those other cavaliers said, {{when they turned}} up here <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b> A noisy crowd they were. I had no room for them in my house, {{so they had to}} go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Saw him <b>about</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b> He {{came to see}} me-- came to see Sammy Simpson-- {{climbed the}} stairs to my abode. Wanted the papers-- said I must have 'em. Went wild with rage when I let slip you had 'em. So did the other gent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I was, bailie, an' so I am," [...] {{replied the}} captain; [...] "leastwise I'm {{still on the}} sick-list, and was in my hammock till <b>about</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> but I'm gettin' round fast. The night air seems to do me a world o' good--contrariwise to doctor's expectations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A tall Englishman had <b>a</b> long {{conversation}} <b>about</b> {{three-quarters of}} <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago</b> with <b>a</b> Jew, Reuben by name, who lives not ten paces from here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, not much--to gossip about. However, she's {{tired to}} death now, {{and not at}} all well, and that's what makes her so restless. She dropped off into a nap <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> and 'twill do her good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gone shopping, I guess. I {{dropped her}} {{here in the}} car <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b> But, say, can't you shed that British calm of yours, and get down to it? What on God's earth {{have you been doing}} all this time?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{young lady}} called here <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> {{and asked for}} you. Johnson {{informed}} her {{that you might be}} home shortly, and she said she would wait. Johnson, perhaps imprudently, admitted her, and she is in the study, my lord." ...|$|E
60|$|Arrived at {{the door}} of her own antechamber, she was met by one of her liveried servants, who told her that Monsieur le Duc d'Aumont was within and {{awaiting}} to see her. To her hastily put query, the man replied that Monsieur le Duc had arrived <b>about</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> and, hearing that Madame la Marquise was closeted with milor, he had elected to wait.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's Ike Goble's show. He {{called me}} up on the phone <b>about</b> it half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b> I promised {{to go and see}} a {{rehearsal}} of it to-morrow or the day after. And Jill's in that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|That made me {{feel pretty}} bad. <b>About</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> or two <b>ago</b> it would a been a little different, but now it {{made me feel}} bad and disappointed, The king rips out and says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know. I reckon so. I {{seen him}} spading up some ground along <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> just before sundown--him and the parson. Said he guessed he wouldn't go to-night, {{but we could}} have his dog if we wanted him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b> I {{told them}} that you had telephoned that {{you were on the}} way home, so they said they'd remain out here, {{watching}} for you. I showed them what room they were to occupy," [...] added the lady of the mansion.|$|E
6000|$|... "I, personally, {{have been}} doing very little indeed," [...] I told her. [...] "Your father entered the {{restaurant}} in a hurry <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago</b> and found it convenient to seat himself at my table and help himself to my dinner. He intrusted me, also, with a packet, which I subsequently returned to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{wonder if}} you and I are {{thinking}} of the same thing,” he said. “It happened just <b>about</b> this <b>hour</b> <b>a</b> year <b>ago,</b> and it was such another night.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The hotel {{people know}} nothing of Mr. Lessingham, your ladyship, beyond {{the fact that he}} did not return last night. They {{received}} a message from Hill's Garage, however, <b>about</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> to say that their mechanic had driven Mr. Lessingham early this morning to Norwich, where he had caught the mail train to London, The boy was to say that Mr. Lessingham would be back in a day or so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said Mrs. Y., {{who was a}} {{much older}} woman, and more motherly, [...] "don't excite yourself. They brought him here <b>about</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> and, {{to tell you the}} truth, I never looked at him. He is in here. I don't think they troubled to take off even his boots. If you keep cool, we will get him downstairs and home without a soul beyond {{ourselves}} being any the wiser.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "a fellow {{like the}} one you speak of came in here <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b> His team looked pretty used up {{and he wanted to}} hire another, but I couldn't deal. Keep my horses hauling {{cordwood}} through the winter, and the only team I have in the stable is ordered by a drummer for to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|He took a cab {{directing}} {{the driver to}} go to Bolton Street and to stop at his club as he passed. There might be letters for him there, he thought--something which would distract his mind a little. As it chanced there was a letter, marked [...] "private," [...] and a telegram; both had been delivered that evening, the porter said, the former <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago</b> by hand.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Champion {{passed me}} <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> when I was in hiding--poor timid soul of me, for I {{had nothing to}} lose by the French coming--and he looked awful with the {{stirrups}} dangling and the saddle empty. 'Tis a gloomy sight, Festy, to see a horse cantering without a rider, and I thought you had been--feared you had been thrown off and killed as dead as a nit.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's {{a pretty}} spot, whoever may own it," [...] said the traveller, {{mounting}} his horse; [...] "and one meets some fine strapping fellows about too. I met as fine a young fellow as ever I saw in my life, <b>about</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> before I {{came up the}} hill--a carpenter, a tall, broad-shouldered fellow with black hair and black eyes, marching along like a soldier. We want such fellows as he to lick the French." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, no." [...] He {{looked at}} her, {{as he had}} done before, with puzzled interest. [...] "I cannot think, I cannot think," [...] he murmured. [...] "Something bewilders me greatly." [...] He still {{reflected}} and hesitated. [...] "Last night I sat up very late," [...] he at last went on, [...] "and on that account I fell into a little nap on that couch <b>about</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b> And during my few minutes of unconsciousness I dreamed--what do you think?--that you stood in the room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You bet I ain't! I {{run across}} {{him in the}} woods <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> or two <b>ago,</b> and he said if I hollered he'd cut my livers out--and told me to lay down and stay where I was; and I done it. Been there ever since; afeard to come out." ...|$|R
