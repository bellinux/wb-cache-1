40|$|The socialist {{regime in}} China {{abolished}} the long-established system {{of private property}} rights in land during the Great Leap Forward (1957 - 1962) and the Cultural Revolution (1966 - 1978) {{and replaced it with}} a bureaucratic and discretionary system based upon the Communist Party hierarchy. Recently, however, through the so-called 'land use rights reform' introduced as part of the economic liberalization programme of Deng Xiao Ping, the Chinese government has in effect revived private property rights in land in the form of leasehold interests <b>allocated</b> <b>by</b> <b>auction,</b> tender and private negotiation. © 1995. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|For {{three years}} (2001 - 2003), fish quotas in the Russian far east (REE) were <b>allocated</b> <b>by</b> <b>auction.</b> First, a short {{overview}} of the RFE fisheries is provided and how the total allowable catch (TAC) is allocated between regions and (before the auctions) enterprises. Then the auction system is discussed. The purpose of the auctions was to divert some of the resource rent to the state budget and to increase the transparency of the quota allocation mechanism. In the end, a lot less of the TAC than intended was sold <b>by</b> <b>auctions.</b> Nevertheless, the auctions provided a substantial income for the government. On the other hand they led {{to a decline in}} industry profits and greater indebtedness of the industry. Arguably they also led to more of illegal fishing, as firms bought quotas in order to cover operations on a greater scale that were not well monitored. In 2004 the auction system was abandoned, in part due to pressures from the industry. Fisheries management Fishing right auctions Russian Far East...|$|R
40|$|A novel multiagent system (MAS) {{has been}} {{proposed}} to integrate individual UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) to form a UAV team which can accomplish complex missions with better efficiency and effect. The MAS based UAV team control is more able to conquer dynamic situations and enhance the performance of any single UAV. In this paper, the MAS proposed and established combines the reacting and thinking abilities to be an initiative and autonomous hybrid system which can solve missions involving coordinated flight and cooperative operation. The MAS uses BDI model to support its logical perception and to classify the different missions; then the missions will be <b>allocated</b> <b>by</b> utilizing <b>auction</b> mechanism after analyzing dynamic parameters. Prim potential algorithm, particle swarm algorithm, and reallocation mechanism are proposed to realize the rational decomposing and optimal allocation {{in order to reach}} the maximum profit. After simulation, the MAS has been proved to be able to promote the success ratio and raise the robustness, while realizing feasibility of coordinated flight and optimality of cooperative mission...|$|R
25|$|A {{tradable}} credit {{can be an}} emissions allowance or an {{assigned amount}} unit which was originally <b>allocated</b> or <b>auctioned</b> <b>by</b> the national administrators of a Kyoto-compliant cap-and-trade scheme, {{or it can be}} an offset of emissions. Such offsetting and mitigating activities can occur in any developing country which has ratified the Kyoto Protocol, and has a national agreement in place to validate its carbon project through one of the UNFCCC's approved mechanisms. Once approved, these units are termed Certified Emission Reductions, or CERs. The Protocol allows these projects to be constructed and credited in advance of the Kyoto trading period.|$|R
40|$|International audienceDespite the {{numerous}} researches about imperfect competition, the market power remains difficult to quantify using traditional economics methods. In this paper, we propose an experimental economics design and outline some ways of analysis of its results toward {{characterization of the}} use of market power. A simple system with two regions and a limited interconnection transfer capacity <b>allocated</b> <b>by</b> an implicit <b>auction</b> is studied. Depending on the experiments two or three subjects share equitably the production capacity in one region, while the production capacity is equitably shared among 5 subjects leading to a more competitive situation in the second one. In both regions, we observe a market price that is different from the theoretical results allowing a quantification {{of the use of}} market power. Results are also analyzed based on a characterization of the subjects' behaviour. Further the impact of subjects' behaviour on the market price evolution is described...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} {{in the use of}} markets within firms. Proponents have noted that markets are a simple and efficient mechanism for allocating resources in economies in which information is dispersed. In contrast to the use of markets in the broader economy, the efficiency of an internal market is determined in large part by the endogenous contractual incentives provided to the participating, privately informed agents. In this paper, we study the optimal design of managerial incentives when resources are <b>allocated</b> <b>by</b> an internal <b>auction</b> market, as well as the efficiency of the resulting resource allocations. We show that the internal auction market can achieve first-best resource allocations and decisions, but only at an excessive cost in compensation payments. We then identify conditions under which the internal auction market and associated optimal incentive contracts achieve the benchmark second-best outcome as determined using a direct revelation mechanism. The advantage of the auction is that it is easier to implement than the direct revelatio...|$|R
40|$|Frequencies {{have become}} a {{resource}} of relevance to the overall economy. Sectors whose services {{are based on the}} use of radio frequencies already produce a substantial share of the GDP (estimated at about 2 percent in the U. K.) and show more dynamic growth rates than the economy in general, including their employment potential. It would therefore be highly inadvisable to neglect this aspect. The paper addresses the economic aspects of frequency management and analyses them with respect to mobile communications. A key point to consider is that frequency allocation processes have short- as much as long-term effects on competition in the relevant market. Whereas in the past frequencies were awarded well below their value, the Austrian Telecoms Act of 1997 provided the underpinnings for an economically efficient frequency management. Frequency allocation is economically efficient only when the frequencies are awarded to the operator with the highest rating. Only then can we assume that it will maximize a country's overall welfare. As a result, frequencies should increasingly be <b>allocated</b> <b>by</b> way of <b>auctions</b> or at least at prices that simulate auctioning procedures. Clear strategies will be required for frequency management to exploit the full economic potential of this valuable asset.
