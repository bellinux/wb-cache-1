5|$|In 1893 a {{chimpanzee}} {{was purchased}} from another of Wombwell's Travelling Menageries in London. The four-year-old chimpanzee, Consul, {{was dressed in}} a smoking jacket and cap <b>and</b> <b>puffed</b> on a cob pipe; he frequently accompanied James Jennison to business meetings. Consul proved to be exceptionally popular, and after his death on 24 November 1894, the Jennisons immediately obtained a replacement, ConsulII, who played a violin while riding a tricycle around the gardens, later graduating to a bicycle.|$|E
5|$|One {{theory is}} that the sculptures {{represent}} deceased individuals with bloated bodies, closed eyes, distended bellies <b>and</b> <b>puffed</b> out faces. The position of the limbs on some monuments, although following the natural contours of the boulder, give an impression of the position of corpses found in later Maya burial bundles. It is possible that Pasaco Monument 2 and the potbelly from San Juan Sacatepéquez portray the placement of a jade bead in the mouth of the sculpture. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the monuments themselves are burial markers, only three sculptures have been found directly associated with human remains. One of these is a ceramic potbelly from Colha in Belize, the others are from Chalchuapa and Kaminaljuyu. However, since most potbelly monuments were not found in their original locations it is impossible to know whether they originally served as burial markers.|$|E

25|$|Korean temple cuisine {{originated}} in Buddhist temples of Korea. Since Buddhism was introduced into Korea, Buddhist traditions have strongly influenced Korean cuisine, as well. During the Silla period (57 BCE– 935 CE), chalbap (찰밥, {{a bowl of}} cooked glutinous rice) yakgwa (a fried dessert) and yumilgwa (a fried <b>and</b> <b>puffed</b> rice snack) were served for Buddhist altars and have been developed into types of hangwa, Korean traditional confectionery. During the Goryeo Dynasty, sangchu ssam (wraps made with lettuce), yaksik, and yakgwa were developed, and since spread to China and other countries. Since the Joseon Dynasty, Buddhist cuisine {{has been established in}} Korea according to regions and temples.|$|E

The article on the wolf begins with the claim that {{it is one of}} the animals with a specially strong appetite for flesh; it asserts that the animal is naturally coarse and cowardly (grossier et poltron), but becoming crafty at need, and hardy by necessity, driven by hunger. The language, as in this instance, is elegant and elaborate, even [...] "flowery and ornate". Buffon was roundly criticised by his fellow academics for writing a [...] "purely popularizing work, empty <b>and</b> <b>puffed</b> up, with little real scientific value".|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method for}} hydrate {{production}} named "Five-spot thermal huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> (HP- 5 S) '' is designed and employed {{to investigate the}} behaviors of hydrate dissociation in the Cubic Hydrate Simulator (CHS). This method uses the thermal huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> method in a five-spot well system. In addition, the experiments with the methods of the five-spot thermal huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> in conjunction with depressurization (HP- 5 S-D), the heat stimulation with a five-spot well (HS- 5 S), the heat stimulation in conjunction with depressurization with a five-spot well (HS- 5 S-D), the thermal huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> (HP), <b>and</b> the huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> in conjunction with depressurization (HP-D), are also carried out in this work. The energy efficiencies, thermal efficiencies, gas recoveries, and average gas production rates are used to evaluate these production methods. The analysis of hydrate decomposition shows that the thermal huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> method in a five-spot well system is superior {{to that in a}} single vertical well on the aspects of the energy efficiency, thermal efficiency, gas recovery, and average gas production rate. The HP- 5 S-D method, which can obtain the highest gas recovery, thermal efficiency, and energy efficiency, is the optimal method for hydrate production in this work. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|With {{superheated}} steam {{there is no}} direct relationship between temperature and pressure, and it can exist at a wide range of temperatures. Superheated steam with high degree(> 50 °C) of superheat has similar thermal physical characteristics with ideal gas and the heat transfer coefficient is 1 / 150 - 1 / 250 as much as that of saturated steam during heat transferring. It could release less energy and transmitted longer distances than that of saturated steam in heavy oil reservoirs. Numerical simulation shows that under the condition of carrying the same heat, {{superheated steam}} huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> enlarged the heating radius by about 10 m, oil production increment by 1463 t, oil steam ratio increase by 0. 7. Superheated steam huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> was put into Kazakstan’s heavy oil reservoir after saturated steam huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> <b>and</b> the average daily oil production was 2 - 4 times that of saturated steam huff <b>and</b> <b>puff,</b> which improved heavy oil production effectively. The secondary heavy oil thermal recovery by superheated steam huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> applicated in marginal heavy oil reservoirs achieved satisfactory effect.

2500|$|Starting in 1902, Quaker Oats oatmeal boxes {{came with}} a coupon redeemable for the legal deed to a tiny lot in Milford. The lots, {{sometimes}} as small as [...] by 10 feet, were carved out of a [...] tract in a never-built subdivision called [...] "Liberty Park". A small number of children (or their parents), often residents living near Milford, collected the deeds and started paying the extremely small property taxes on the [...] "oatmeal lots". The developer of the prospective subdivision hoped the landowners would hire him to build homes on the lots, although several lots {{would need to be}} combined before building could start. Since the subdivision into small lots predated Milford's planning and zoning regulations, the deeds were entirely legal, although they created a large amount of paperwork for town tax collectors, who frequently couldn't find the property owners and received almost no tax revenue from the lots.In the mid-1970s, when the town wanted to develop the area, town officials {{put an end to the}} oatmeal lots in a [...] "general foreclosure" [...] that avoided the enormous expense of individual foreclosures by condemning nearly all of the property in one legal filing. One of the streets in the Liberty Park subdivision plans, Shelland Street, was later built in the late 1990s as an access road to the Milford Power Company. The site is currently home to the BIC Corporation's lighter factory at 565 Bic Drive.

The thermal huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> process is analyzed, and it is concluded that each huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> cycle includes three stages: heat injection, soaking, and gas production The injected heat spreads out from the injection point. The region impacted by heat diffusion enlarges as the number of huff <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> cycles increases <b>and</b> eventually reaches the largest impact region. After that, the region;impacted by heat diffusion is no longer increasing with continuous heat injection. The change characteristics of the injection temperature, pressure, resistance ratio, and other related parameters during the injection are obtained. The result also verifies that the hydrate decomposition process is a moving boundary ablation process in the three-dimensional level...|$|R
