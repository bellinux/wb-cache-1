5|$|During the 2011-2015 term, the State Senate {{was made}} up of 35 Democrats and 12 Republicans. Republicans gained two seats (District 6 in Baltimore County and District 29 in Calvert and St. Mary's counties) in the {{elections}} held on November 4, 2014. Democrats maintain a super-majority in the chamber despite these changes. Article II, Section 17(a) of the Maryland Constitution specifies it takes a three-fifths vote of both chambers to override <b>a</b> <b>veto,</b> which is 29 votes in the State Senate. The rules of the Senate also permit members to limit debate by a three-fifths majority vote, meaning Republicans would need to gain five additional seats, for a total of 19, in order to sustain <b>a</b> <b>veto</b> or filibuster legislation.|$|E
5|$|H.B. 444 was {{introduced}} in the Hawaii House of Representatives on January 26, 2009. It passed the Hawaii House Judiciary Committee on February 5, 2009, with 12members voting in favor and none opposed and was approved by the Hawaii House of Representatives on February 12, 2009, with 33 members voting in favor and 17 opposed, one vote fewer than the two-thirds vote needed to override <b>a</b> <b>veto</b> by the Republican Governor Linda Lingle, who did not indicate whether she considered <b>a</b> <b>veto.</b> It was referred to the Hawaii Senate on February 13, 2009. A hearing by the Committee on Judiciary and Government Operations (JGO) was held at the State Capitol on February 24, 2009, with the outcome of three senators supporting the bill and three opposed; the bill was not passed out of committee.|$|E
5|$|This {{pay raise}} {{proposal}} was submitted as {{an amendment to}} the government's general appropriations bill. Had Grant vetoed the bill, the government would not have any money to operate for the following fiscal year, which would have necessitated a special session of Congress. However, Grant missed an opportunity to make a statement by threatening <b>a</b> <b>veto.</b>|$|E
50|$|The General Assembly has {{the power}} to {{override}} gubernatorial <b>vetoes</b> through <b>a</b> three-fifths majority vote in each chamber.The governor has different types of <b>veto</b> like <b>a</b> full <b>veto</b> and <b>a</b> reduction <b>veto.</b> If the governor decides that the bill needs changes, he will ask for <b>an</b> amendatory <b>veto.</b>|$|R

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, a simple {{majority}} {{of the members of}} each house can choose to approve <b>a</b> <b>vetoed</b> bill precisely as the Legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto. This is in contrast to the practice in most states and the federal government, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses to override <b>a</b> governor's <b>veto.</b>|$|R
5|$|Foraker {{had known}} that with McKinley in the Executive Mansion (as the White House was still {{formally}} known) and Sherman expected to be senior senator, he could expect only limited patronage appointments for his supporters. With McKinley's close friend Hanna instead in the Senate, Foraker was allowed to recommend appointees to the President, but McKinley allowed Hanna to exercise <b>a</b> <b>veto</b> over Foraker's candidates.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, The Guardian {{reported}} that British screenwriter Rupert Walters {{was writing a}} movie based on Riefenstahl's life which would star actress Jodie Foster. The project did not receive Riefenstahl's approval prior to her death, as Riefenstahl asked for <b>a</b> <b>veto</b> on any scenes to which she did not agree. Riefenstahl also wanted Sharon Stone to play her rather than Foster, which ultimately resulted in the cancellation of the project.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August 1934, civil {{servants}} {{were required to}} swear an oath of unconditional obedience to Hitler; a similar oath had been required of members of the military several weeks prior. This law became the basis of the Führerprinzip, the concept that Hitler's word overrode all existing laws. Any acts that were sanctioned by Hitler—even murder—thus became legal. All legislation proposed by cabinet ministers had to be approved by the office of Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess, who also had <b>a</b> <b>veto</b> over top civil service appointments.|$|E

5|$|The United States sent strong {{indications}} to Brazil that it {{was willing}} to support its membership; albeit, without <b>a</b> <b>veto.</b> In June 2011, the Council on Foreign Relations recommended that the US government fully endorse the inclusion of Brazil as a permanent member of the Security Council. Brazil has received backing from other permanent members: Russia, the United Kingdom and France, and from the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), Chile, Indonesia, Finland, Slovenia, Australia, South Africa, Guatemala, Vietnam and the Philippines, {{as well as from}} the other G4 nations, who mutually support each other.|$|E
5|$|The amnesty {{was passed}} by the Chamber of Deputies by a vote of 125–23. Under the threat of having <b>a</b> <b>veto</b> overridden, Fonseca signed the amnesty. The rebels {{returned}} on 26 November after a short period of consternation—additional demands, such as an increase in salary, had yet to be proposed in Congress, much less passed—with their ships in formation, Minas Geraes leading São Paulo, with Bahia and Deodoro to each side. By 7pm, the mutineers officially accepted the amnesty provisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} {{works in}} concert with the state legislature (the bicameral Indiana General Assembly, consisting of the Indiana House of Representatives and the Indiana Senate) and the state supreme court (the Supreme Court of Indiana) to govern the state. The governor has the power to veto legislation passed by the General Assembly. If vetoed, a bill is returned to the General Assembly for reconsideration. Unlike other states, most of which require a two-thirds supermajority to override <b>a</b> <b>veto,</b> the Indiana General Assembly may override the veto with an absolute majority vote in both chambers.|$|E

5|$|Tolerance {{of other}} {{religions}} was over-supported by {{some in the}} English Party and others educated in the West {{as a symbol of}} Greece's progress as a liberal European state. In the end, power over the Church and education was ceded to the Russian Party, while the King maintained <b>a</b> <b>veto</b> over the decision of the Synod of Bishops. This was to keep balance and avoid discrediting Greece in the eyes of Western Europe as a backward, religiously intolerant society.|$|E
5|$|Another {{question}} of contention was the Progress Party's policy on Norwegian {{membership in the}} European Union. Reportedly, Carl I. Hagen wanted to postpone a decision on European Union policy from the national convention to a national board meeting in June. Others were {{not in favor of}} this. In an interview, Hagen stated that political parties should not agitate officially for one opinion or the other. He stated an indifference towards EU membership, and that if accessing the Union, Norway could always use <b>a</b> <b>veto</b> against EU policies when needed. Central board member Terje Sæbø submitted a competing resolution which opposed Norwegian membership.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} poised to become a state park in 1903, but <b>a</b> <b>veto</b> by Governor Richard Yates {{prevented}} that from occurring. Supporters continued to press for the White Pines Woods, as it was once known, to receive state park designation throughout the period 1903-1927. In 1927 the park was established with help from supporters in the Chicago media. The park contains two freshwater streams, dolomite rock formations, {{and a variety of}} activities generally associated with Illinois state parks. Along Pine Creek, one of the park's two streams, fords were constructed instead of bridges allowing visitors to drive through the creek.|$|E

5|$|To {{become law}} or bill, a {{constitutional}} amendment {{had to have the}} assent of both the Diet and the Emperor. This meant that while the Emperor could no longer legislate by decree he still had <b>a</b> <b>veto</b> over the Diet. The Emperor also had complete freedom in choosing the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, and so, under the Meiji constitution, Prime Ministers often were not chosen from and did not enjoy the confidence of the Diet. The Imperial Diet was also limited in its control over the budget. While the Diet could veto the annual budget, if no budget was approved the budget of the previous year continued in force. This all changed with the new constitution after World War II.|$|E
5|$|Tribunes {{could use}} their sacrosanctity {{to order the}} use of capital {{punishment}} against any person who interfered with their duties. Tribunes could also use their sacrosanctity as protection when physically manhandling an individual, such as when arresting someone. On a couple of rare occasions (such as during the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus), a tribune might use a form of blanket obstruction, which could involve a broad veto over all governmental functions. While a tribune could veto any act of the senate, the assemblies, or the magistrates, he could only veto the act, and not the actual measure. Therefore, he had to physically be present when the act was occurring. As soon as that tribune was no longer present, the act could be completed as if {{there had never been}} <b>a</b> <b>veto.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{the media}} asked King Juan Carlos {{if he would}} sign the bill that was being debated in the Cortes Generales, he {{answered}} {{that he was the}} King of Spain, not of Belgiuma reference to King Baudouin of Belgium, who refused to sign the Belgian law legalising abortion. For the King to withhold his royal assent, it would effect <b>a</b> <b>veto</b> of the legislation. However, the King gave his royal assent to Law 13/2005 on 1 July 2005, and the law was gazetted in the Boletín Oficial del Estado on 2 July, and came into effect on 3 July. The King received criticism by Carlist and other far right conservatives for signing the legislation.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{proposals}} {{assume that}} endowing the U. S. President with <b>a</b> line item <b>veto</b> will reduce spending. Analysis {{of a rich}} set of state budget data indicates that long run budgets are not altered by <b>an</b> item <b>veto.</b> In the short run, the item veto's potency is contingent upon the political setting. Governors with political incentives to use <b>an</b> item <b>veto</b> alter spending and revenues in a statistically significant and quantitatively important fashion. These results suggest that adoption of the line item veto, in general, is unlikely {{to reduce the size}} of the federal government. ...|$|R

5|$|At the convention, held August 5–8, Agnew {{abandoned}} his favorite son status, placing Nixon's name in nomination. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination {{on the first}} ballot. In the discussions that followed about a running mate, Nixon kept his counsel while various party factions thought they could influence his choice: Strom Thurmond, the senator from South Carolina, told a party meeting that he held <b>a</b> <b>veto</b> on the vice presidency. It was evident that Nixon wanted a centrist, though there was little enthusiasm when he first proposed Agnew, and other possibilities were discussed. Some party insiders thought that Nixon had privately settled on Agnew early on, and that the consideration of other candidates {{was little more than}} a charade. On August 8, after a final meeting of advisers and party leaders, Nixon declared that Agnew was his choice, and shortly afterwards announced his decision to the press. Delegates formally nominated Agnew for the vice presidency later that day, before adjourning.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, Gore {{spoke out}} {{on a number of}} issues. In a 1992 speech on the Gulf War, Gore stated that he twice {{attempted}} to get the U.S. government to pull the plug on support to Saddam Hussein, citing Hussein's use of poison gas, support of terrorism, and his burgeoning nuclear program, but was opposed both times by the Reagan and Bush administrations. In the wake of the Al-Anfal Campaign, during which Hussein staged deadly mustard and nerve gas attacks on Kurdish Iraqis, Gore cosponsored the Prevention of Genocide Act of 1988, which would have cut all assistance to Iraq. The bill was defeated in part due to intense lobbying of Congress by the Reagan-Bush White House and <b>a</b> <b>veto</b> threat from President Reagan. In 1998, at a conference of APEC hosted by Malaysia, Gore objected to the indictment, arrest and jailing of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad's longtime second-in-command Anwar Ibrahim, a move which received a negative response from leaders there. Ten years later, Gore again protested when Ibrahim was arrested a second time, a decision condemned by Malaysian foreign minister Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} Republican victory in November 1866, Johnson {{considered}} {{himself in a}} strong position. The Fourteenth Amendment had been ratified by none of the Southern or border states except Tennessee, and had been rejected in Kentucky, Delaware, and Maryland. As the amendment required ratification by three-quarters of the states {{to become part of}} the Constitution, he believed the deadlock would be broken in his favor, leading to his election in 1868. Once it reconvened in December 1866, an energized Congress began passing legislation, often over a presidential veto; this included the District of Columbia voting bill. Congress admitted Nebraska to the Union over <b>a</b> <b>veto,</b> and the Republicans gained two senators and a state that promptly ratified the amendment. Johnson's veto of a bill for statehood for Colorado Territory was sustained; enough senators agreed that a district with a population of 30,000 was not yet worthy of statehood to win the day.|$|E
