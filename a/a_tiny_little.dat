25|$|Of furniture, folding seats {{like the}} modern camp stool, and chairs with legs {{terminating}} in {{the heads of}} beasts or the feet of animals, Furniture still exist. Beds supported by lions paws XI. and XII. dynasties, from Gebelein, now in the Cairo Museum), headrests, 6 or 8 in. high, shaped like a crutch on a foot, very like those used by the native of New Guinea today, are carved with scenes, etc., in outline. In the British Museum may be seen <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>little</b> coffer, 4 in. by 21/2 in., with very delicate figures carved in low relief. This little box stands on cabriole legs 3/4 of an inch long with claw feet, quite Louis Quinze in character. There are incense ladles, the handle representing a bouquet of lotus flowers, the bowl formed like the leaf of an aquatic plant with serrated edges from Gurnah during the XVIII. dynasty; mirror handles, representing a little pillar, or a lotus stalk, sometimes surmounted by a head of Hathor, the Egyptian Venus or of Bes, god of the toilet; pin-cushions, {{in the shape of}} a small round tortoise with holes in the back for toilet pins, which were also of wood with dog-head ends (XI. dynasty, Cairo Museum); and perfume boxes such as a fish, the two halves forming the bottom and top of the perfume or pomatum was removed by little wooden spoons, one shaped in the form of a cartouche emerging from a full-blown lotus, another shaped like the neck of a goose, a third consisting of a dog running with a fish in its closed mouth, the fish forming the bowl. The list might be prolonged, but enough has been said to show to what a pitch of refinement the art of wood-carving had reached thousands of years before the birth of Christ.|$|E
500|$|Michael Dorn {{returned}} as Lieutenant Commander Worf; Dorn had portrayed that character in Deep Space Nine since 1995. Reprising {{her role as}} Doctor Beverly Crusher, Gates McFadden said that [...] "Shooting Star Trek and getting paid {{to do it is}} great. But what's actually changed my life the most is travelling around and...being <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>little</b> part of this huge mythology that has changed people's lives, in many ways for the better." [...] Marina Sirtis appeared once more as Counselor Deanna Troi. She was positive about the film, saying [...] "we've been involved with this for eleven years, we've done 179 episodes, three movies, and there are still surprises. There are more layers in this movie, it's not as black and white. It goes back to a lot of what Gene Roddenberry felt about Star TrekI think he's going to be very happy up there when he sees this movie." ...|$|E

500|$|Amy Ratcliffe, {{writing for}} IGN, ranked the episode as the fifth best episode of Veronica Mars, writing, [...] "the Season 2 finale had head-twisting reveals, heartbreaking moments…tragedy, {{and so many}} jumps in crime-solving that Sherlock {{might not have been}} able to keep up." [...] BuzzFeed called the episode the best episode of the series, stating, [...] "It's {{extremely}} violent, extremely scary, and extremely moving. If you don't cry watching this episode, there's <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>little</b> rock where your heart should be." [...] On a similar list, TV Line ranked the episode third, only behind [...] "A Trip to the Dentist" [...] and [...] "Pilot". Give Me My Remote also ranked the episode as the best of the series, writing, [...] "If I had to pick a single episode to represent the show, this would be it. The actual plot of this episode was compelling, fast-paced, and the twist at the end was shocking." [...] The reviewer went on to praise Kristen Bell's performance and the less action-heavy parts of the episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{almost entirely}} sampled nature of Endtroducing..... was {{considered}} groundbreaking {{at the time}} of its release, and Guinness World Records has cited the album as being the first to be created entirely from sampled sources. The album was a driving force in the development of instrumental hip hop music, inspiring several other disc jockeys and producers to create sample-based works. Tim Stelloh of PopMatters cited it as the [...] "benchmark" [...] for the genre. Guitarist Jonny Greenwood of English alternative rock band Radiohead has cited Endtroducing..... as an influence on his band's critically acclaimed album OK Computer (1997), saying that they [...] "liked how he was cutting up beats quite minutely." [...] Several of the artists sampled on Endtroducing..... – including British progressive rock band Nirvana and American musician David Axelrod – have praised the album. DJ Shadow has expressed his surprise at the album's influence and high regard amongst other musicians, saying: [...] "After the record, I'd always bump into these world-class producers who'd say, 'Yeah, Endtroducing..... – what a great piece of production.' I just did it on one sampler in <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>little</b> studio." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{failing to}} cross a musical and {{colorful}} bridge, the gang falls into a pit where sticky material becomes their zombie-like doppelgangers and moves to chase them. They escape through a Super Mario World-like environment {{and go to the}} house of a toy dog, where they are set up for a trap to eat crumpets with sleeping powder. Mac does not eat the crumpets (since the sleeping powder was thought to be powdered sugar, and he can't eat sugar without temporarily losing his mind) and is able to save the others. As they try to escape, they discover that the heroic man and several others they have met on their journey are all controlled by a single face—World—who can animate and control seemingly anything he latches onto. World is trapped on an apple and the gang leaves it at a desert; but latches on a horse, truly the guise of Mac and the gang rides by, and World is able to move once more. It gallops off to the castle, where the gang find Frankie and attempt to save her. However, Frankie reveals that World never kidnapped her, she was staying of her own free will and is happy to be away from the work at Foster's and Mr. Herriman's constant nagging. The friends then plead with Frankie to come home insisting that they need her to take care of them. She believes their pleas to be selfish and storms off as she is [...] "sick of taking care of everyone and everything without never even receiving a word of thanks, an ounce of help, or <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>little</b> smidgen of respect". They attempt to console her, but World gasses them and they fall asleep. When they awaken, they find themselves in a fake version of Foster's created by World, who shrank them into it.|$|E

2500|$|As {{people with}} {{roots in the}} Indian subcontinent who reside in the Caribbean were more {{receptive}} of the bikini than people of their original homeland, bikinis remain a repeating theme in Calypso music ("Whole day she jumping shamelessly/In <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>little</b> bikini" [...] etc.). Australian pop-rock band Screaming Bikini (led by Sarah McLeod), Hungarian rock band Bikini, American dance-rock band Bikini Robot Army, punk rock band Bikini Kill and Los Angeles based electropop duo Cherry Bikini – all had names inspired by the bikini. In 1997 the French-German Electronic band Stereo Total released an album named Monokini. Spanish rock band Hombres G released its seventh album Historia del bikini in 1992. In 1994, Martinis and Bikinis, the seventh (studio) album from American singer-songwriter Sam Phillips, came out. Dutch breakcore musician Bong-Ra released his album Bikini Bandits, Kill! Kill! Kill! in 2003.|$|E

6000|$|This {{houseboat}} was Ethelbertha's idea. We {{had spent}} a day, the summer before, on one belonging {{to a friend of}} mine, and she had been enraptured with the life.

50|$|NGC 6544 {{is located}} {{in the western part of}} the constellation, on the edge of a rich star field; its {{location}} is easily recoverable as it is located just 50' towards the southeast compared to the famous Lagoon Nebula.
