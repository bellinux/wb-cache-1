50|$|The {{issue of}} appeals from the High Court to the United Kingdom's Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was a {{significant}} one during the drafting of the Constitution and it continued to be significant {{in the years after}} the court's creation. The wording of section 74 of the constitution that was put to voters in the various colonies was that there was to be no appeal to the Privy Council in any matter involving the interpretation of the Constitution or of the Constitution of a State, unless it involved the interests of some other dominion. However, the British insisted on a compromise. Section 74 as ultimately enacted by the Imperial Parliament was as follows:No <b>appeal</b> <b>shall</b> be permitted to the Queen in Council in any matter involving the interpretation of this Constitution or of the Constitution of a State from a decision of the High Court upon any question, howsoever arising, as to the limits inter se of the Constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of any State or States, or as to the limits inter se of the Constitutional powers of any two or more States, unless the public interests of some part of Her Majesty's Dominions, other than the Commonwealth or a State, are involved. the High Court shall certify that the question is one which ought to be determined by Her Majesty in Council.The High Court may so certify if satisfied that for any special reason the certificate should be granted, and thereupon <b>an</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>shall</b> lie to Her Majesty in Council on the question without further leave.Except as provided in this section, this Constitution shall not impair any right which the Queen may be pleased to exercise, by virtue of Her Royal prerogative Prerogative, to grant special leave of appeal from the High Court to Her Majesty in Council.
