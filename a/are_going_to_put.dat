500|$|Lody {{returned}} to Edinburgh on 17 September, taking the train from King's Cross to Edinburgh. He met a young Scottish woman, Ida McClyment, gave her his card {{and talked with}} her a while before going into another carriage to smoke. There he overheard a conversation between two men, one apparently a submariner travelling to the naval base at Rosyth {{and the other a}} sailor who talked about Harwich. Lody later professed his surprise at how the two men were [...] "talking in a rather free way, considering the present times". One of the men talked about the difficulties of serving on a submarine, while the other asked Lody: [...] "What country are you? Are you from the other side?" [...] Lody replied, [...] "Yes, I am an American." [...] They began discussing the war and talked about the recent sinking of the cruiser HMS Pathfinder, which had become the first ship ever to be sunk by a torpedo fired by a submarine. The sailor told Lody, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out mines as the Germans have done so. We have a big surprise in store for the Germans." [...] Lody was not convinced and, after shaking hands with the sailor, left the smoking car.|$|E
500|$|Penn State's {{defense had}} excelled {{in their first}} two games, but regressed {{significantly}} against Central Florida, particularly with poor tackling, which some attributed to their practice strategy of [...] "thud" [...] tackling, in which one does not actually take a player to the ground, instead making a [...] "thud" [...] to stop a player. Several media outlets speculated that the Lions used this due to their lack of scholarship players {{in the wake of}} sanctions imposed due to the Penn State child sex abuse scandal. Defensive coordinator John Butler renounced that assertion, commenting he employed [...] "thud" [...] when he coached at South Carolina. Penn State's linebackers were also criticized; Glenn Carson and Nyeem Wartman received criticism for not being as strong as the 2012 team's Michael Mauti and Gerald Hodges. In addition, 2012 Big Ten Freshman of the Year defensive end Deion Barnes [...] "barely wreaked any havoc", and DaQuan Jones, whose strong play had previously compensated for Barnes' weak play, was held to just five tackles. The offense, however, was considered a [...] "bright spot"; they gained 455 total yards, though receiver Allen Robinson commented that a fast start would have helped them gain more early momentum: [...] "We are in the Big Ten playing against some great offenses and people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> points up early, so we need to get going early and start off fast." [...] Freshman quarterback Christian Hackenberg earned Big Ten Freshman of the Week accolades {{for the second time in}} the first three weeks of the season.|$|E

Riley, Jr. {{denounced the}} attack and said, [...] "Of all cities, in Charleston, to have a horrible hateful person go into the church and kill people there to pray and worship with each other is {{something}} that is beyond any comprehension and is not explained. We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> our arms around that church and that church family." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{financial}} backing and grants, Mower {{and his team of}} physicians developed a working AICD by 1980. Dr. Levi Watkins, Jr. implanted the first AICD in a human patient in February 1980. At the time of the implantation, Mirowski and Mower had demonstrated that the device was effective in canines. The operating room at Johns Hopkins Hospital in which the first operation took place was crowded with onlookers. Mower recalled, “It was the talk of the whole hospital that these crazy guys <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> in an automatic defibrillator. If something had gone awry, we would have never lived it down.” ...|$|E

He died during the night while his father sand the death song over his prostrate body. His father and mother and neighbors carried the body to a secret cave, saying it must not be polluted by the touch of any white man." ...|$|E

Collaborating with her publisher, Avon, an imprint of Harper Collins, {{she became a}} spokesperson, along with six other Avon Romance authors, in a program named K.I.S.S. and TEAL to {{increase}} awareness about the early symptoms of this disease.
