40|$|This paper {{examines}} the trends and patterns in self-employment in Canada and the United States. In {{the first part}} of the paper, an analysis of aggregate and disaggregated trends is presented. The identification of lifecycle, cohort and <b>aggregate</b> economy <b>effects</b> on these trends are then discussed and estimates of their relative importance provided. Little evidence of cohort effects is found, and although a clear lifecycle pattern exists, the age structure in either country did not change enough to account for a majority of the increase in self-employment. Instead, <b>aggregate</b> economy <b>effects</b> are found to be the source of most of the increase in both countries. Various candidates for these <b>aggregate</b> <b>effects</b> offered in the literature are then briefly examined for congruence with the pattern of <b>aggregate</b> economy <b>effects,</b> purged of cohort and lifecycle effects. The results provide some support for the hypothesis that individuals enter self-employment to evade both income and employment taxes.

If these various operations could be correctly performed, the result would be prophecy; but, as they can be performed only with a certain approximation to correctness, mankind can never predict with absolute certainty, but only with a less or greater degree of probability; according as they are better or worse apprised what the causes are,--have learnt with more or less accuracy from experience the law to which each of those causes, when acting separately, conforms, --and have summed up the <b>aggregate</b> <b>effect</b> more or less carefully.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a framework}} for analysis of <b>aggregate</b> <b>effects</b> of international regimes – and demonstrates its relevance {{in the case of}} management of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA) in developing countries. Whereas many regime studies have focused on the effectiveness of international regimes – where effects are measured against the norms and rules of the regimes themselves – <b>aggregate</b> <b>effects</b> of international regimes are here measured against a set of criteria developed independently of the regimes. This approach is considered relevant when two or more regimes interact with regard to an issue area, and none of them cover the totality of measures assumed necessary to solve the problems. It is also relevant when there is scope for regime conflict. The management of PGRFA comprises many issues, and in demonstrating the method, one central issue has been selected: access to PGRFA, which is crucial for food security. The paper identifies the international norms and rules pertaining to access to PGRFA in the period 1992 – 2004, overlaps in their functional scopes, and the interaction among them. From these regime constellations, assumptions on the <b>aggregate</b> <b>effects</b> for developing countries are derived. These assumptions are in turn tested in case studies from the Philippines, where the <b>aggregate</b> regime <b>effects</b> on access to PGRFA are analysed in terms of policy decisions and goal achievements. Finally, the general relevance of the findings for other developing countries is discussed. A key conclusion is that the <b>aggregate</b> <b>effects</b> of the international regimes in question were largely detrimental to access to PGRFA in developing countries throughout the period studied – despite other intentions behind the individual agreements. The result of these developments is an emerging anti-commons tragedy: a situation where multiple actors have the possibilities to exclude each other from access to these vital resources. ...|$|R

60|$|In {{the same}} work, and more {{particularly}} in the third volume, are also fully discussed {{the limits of the}} applicability of mathematical principles to the improvement of other sciences. Such principles are manifestly inapplicable, where the causes on which any class of phenomena depend are so imperfectly accessible to our observation, that we can not ascertain, by a proper induction, their numerical laws; or where the causes are so numerous, and intermixed in so complex a manner with one another, that even supposing their laws known, the computation of the <b>aggregate</b> <b>effect</b> transcends the powers of the calculus as it is, or is likely to be; or, lastly, where the causes themselves {{are in a state of}} perpetual fluctuation; as in physiology, and still more, if possible, in the social science. The mathematical solutions of physical questions become progressively more difficult and imperfect, in proportion as the questions divest themselves of their abstract and hypothetical character, and approach nearer to the degree of complication actually existing in nature; insomuch that beyond the limits of astronomical phenomena, and of those most nearly analogous to them, mathematical accuracy is generally obtained “at the expense of the reality of the inquiry:” while even in astronomical questions, “notwithstanding the admirable simplicity of their mathematical elements, our feeble intelligence becomes incapable of following out effectually the logical combinations of the laws on which the phenomena are dependent, as soon as we attempt to take into simultaneous consideration more than two or three essential influences.”(201) Of this, the problem of the Three Bodies has already been cited, more than once, as a remarkable instance; the complete solution of so comparatively simple a question having vainly tried the skill of the most profound mathematicians. We may conceive, then, how chimerical would be the hope that mathematical principles could be advantageously applied to phenomena dependent on the mutual action of the innumerable minute particles of bodies, as those of chemistry, and still more, of physiology; and for similar reasons those principles remain inapplicable to the still more complex inquiries, the subjects of which are phenomena of society and government.|$|E
