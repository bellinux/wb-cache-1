5|$|<b>A</b> <b>clan</b> {{chief is}} the head of his or her clan/family, and is the representer of the family's founder. <b>A</b> <b>clan</b> chief must be {{recognised}} as such by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, and must possess the undifferenced arms of their name.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} level 3, characters may join <b>a</b> <b>clan,</b> {{a band of}} cooperating characters. <b>A</b> <b>clan</b> has <b>a</b> <b>clan</b> hall {{which can}} be furnished with beneficial equipment as well as <b>a</b> <b>clan</b> stash for sharing useful items. Clan members can chat {{with each other in}} a private chat channel. In 2008, a multiplayer dungeon was added which allows clan members to raid cooperatively in Hobopolis, the underground city of hobos. Eurogamer likened Hobopolis to World of Warcraft instances. Additional clan dungeons have since been added, including the Slimetube, Dreadsylvania, and the limited-time Haunted Sorority House.|$|E

5|$|Another {{crucial role}} in the Clan is that of the deputy. When a new Clan leader is appointed, or the old deputy dies or retires, a new cat will be chosen to fulfill this role. The deputy of <b>a</b> <b>Clan</b> is {{generally}} in charge of less urgent, but still important duties, such as deciding which cats will go on a hunting patrol and which will check the borders. Although the Clan deputy still sleeps in the warriors den, they are respected by other members of the Clan. Often, a cat will come to the deputy first when asking for advice. When <b>a</b> <b>Clan</b> leader dies, the current deputy will take on the new role of leader, and receive their nine lives from StarClan.|$|E
5|$|Clan chieftains, like clan chiefs, may {{wear their}} own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their own motto or slogan. Clan chieftains may also wear two small eagle feathers (unlike the chief's three). On certain occasions real eagle feathers may be worn behind the crest badge. If <b>a</b> <b>clan</b> chieftain {{is a member of}} the British Peerage or a feudal baron they are permitted to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge. Recently feudal barons have taken to wearing two eagle feathers behind their armiger's badge but there is no ancient tradition of this and it is solely based upon the fact that anciently feudal barons were most likely to have been chiefs or chieftains. If the feudal baron is a member of <b>a</b> <b>clan</b> it is advisable to consult the clan chief on clan customs and traditions. The Lord Lyon only gives guidance and not governance on the wearing of feathers and recommends consulting with <b>a</b> <b>clan</b> chief who approves the number of feathers worn by members of the clan.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of agnatic kinship and a feudal system of obligation {{has been seen}} as creating the highland clan system, evident in records from the 13th century. Surnames were rare in the highlands until the 17th and 18th centuries and in the Middle Ages all members of <b>a</b> <b>clan</b> did not share a name and most ordinary members were usually not related to its head. The head of <b>a</b> <b>clan</b> {{in the beginning of the}} era was often the strongest male in the main sept or branch of the clan, but later, as primogeniture began to dominate, was usually the eldest son of the last chief. The leading families of <b>a</b> <b>clan</b> formed the fine, often seen as equivalent to lowland gentlemen, providing council in peace and leadership in war, and below them were the daoine usisle (in Gaelic) or tacksmen (in Scots), who managed the clan lands and collected the rents. In the isles and along the adjacent western seaboard there were also buannachann, who acted as a military elite, defending the clan lands from raids or taking part in attacks on clan enemies. Most of the followers of the clan were tenants, who supplied labour to the clan heads and sometimes act as soldiers. In the early modern era they would take the clan name as their surname, turning the clan into a massive, if often fictive, kin group.|$|E

5|$|A Scottish crest badge is a heraldic badge worn to show {{allegiance}} {{to an individual}} or membership in a specific Scottish clan. Crest badges are commonly called clan crests, {{but this is a}} misnomer; {{there is no such thing}} as a collective clan crest, just as there is no such thing as <b>a</b> <b>clan</b> coat of arms.|$|E

50|$|<b>Clan</b> Strachan is <b>a</b> Scottish <b>clan</b> {{originating}} from Aberdeenshire. The clan {{does not have}} a chief now, therefore it is considered by Court of the Lord Lyon and the Stand Council of Scottish Chiefs as <b>an</b> Armigerous <b>clan.</b>|$|R
5|$|Clan chiefs may {{wear their}} crest simpliciter, that is without being encircled by the motto {{and without any}} feathers. It is more common, however, for <b>a</b> <b>clan</b> chiefs to wear their own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their motto or slogan (pictured left). The chief's crest badge does not contain the strap and buckle that other clan members are permitted to wear. Clan chiefs are also entitled to wear three eagle feathers behind the circlet of their crest badge. On certain occasions, such as clan gatherings, it may be appropriate to use real eagle feathers. Clan chiefs that {{are members of the}} British Peerage or a feudal baron are entitled to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge, though {{this is a matter of}} personal preference.|$|E
5|$|Missions are tasks {{undertaken}} by <b>a</b> <b>clan.</b> There are {{four types of}} missions: regular, encounter, dispatch, and area. In regular missions, Marche's entire party ventures to a particular location to do battle. Many of these missions are used to advance the story. In encounter missions, Marche's group battles a rival mercenary clan by purchasing a mission or meeting them on the map. In dispatch missions, which do not involve battle, Marche temporarily sends away one member from his party. Area missions are usually a dispatch mission where Marche's clan can liberate certain regions to obtain bonuses and discounts at shops.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of agnatic kinship and a feudal system of obligation {{has been seen}} as creating the highland clan system. The head of <b>a</b> <b>clan</b> was usually the eldest son of the last chief of the most powerful sept or branch. The leading families of <b>a</b> <b>clan</b> formed the fine, often seen as equivalent to lowland lairds, providing council in peace and leadership in war, and below them were the daoine usisle (in Gaelic) or tacksmen (in Scots), who managed the clan lands and collected the rents. In the isles and along the adjacent western seaboard there were also buannachann, who acted as a military elite, defending the clan lands from raids or taking part in attacks on clan enemies. Most of the followers of the clan were tenants, who supplied labour to the clan heads and sometimes acted as soldiers. In the early modern period they usually took the clan name as their surname, turning it into a massive, if often fictive, kin group. Because the Highland Clans were not a direct threat to the Restoration government, or relations with England, the same effort was not put into suppressing their independence as had been focused on the Borders, until after the Glorious Revolution. Economic change and the imposition of royal justice had begun to undermine the clan system before the eighteenth century, but the process was accelerated after the rebellion of 1745, with Highland dress banned, the enforced disarming of clansmen, the compulsory purchase of heritable jurisdictions, the exile of many chiefs and sending of ordinary clansmen to the colonies as indentured labour. All of this largely reducing clan leaders to the status of simple landholders within a generation.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} of agnatic kinship and the feudal system, which formalised mutual obligations {{of service and}} protection, organised through heritable jurisdictions, {{has been seen as}} creating the Highland clan system. The head of <b>a</b> <b>clan</b> was usually the eldest son of the last chief of the most powerful sept or branch. The leading families of <b>a</b> <b>clan</b> formed the fine, often seen as equivalent to Lowland lairds, providing council in peace and leadership in war, and below them were the daoine usisle (in Gaelic) or tacksmen (in Scots), who managed the clan lands and collected the rents. Most of the followers of the clan were tenants, who supplied labour to the clan heads and could be called upon to act as soldiers when needed. In the early modern era they usually took the clan name as their surname, turning it into a massive, if often fictive, kin group. Economic change and the imposition of royal justice had begun to undermine the clan system before the eighteenth century, but the process was accelerated after the Jacobite rising of 1745. Highland dress was banned, clansmen were forcible disarmed, there was the compulsory purchase of heritable jurisdictions, many chiefs were exiled and ordinary clansmen were sent to the colonies as indentured labourers. Within a generation, these factors reduced most clan leaders to the status of simple landholders, without independent military power.|$|E
5|$|The truce of Hudaybiyyah was {{enforced}} for two years. The {{tribe of}} Banu Khuza'a had {{good relations with}} Muhammad, whereas their enemies, the Banu Bakr, had allied with the Meccans. <b>A</b> <b>clan</b> of the Bakr made a night raid against the Khuza'a, killing a few of them. The Meccans helped the Banu Bakr with weapons and, according to some sources, a few Meccans also {{took part in the}} fighting. After this event, Muhammad sent a message to Mecca with three conditions, asking them to accept one of them. These were: either the Meccans would pay blood money for the slain among the Khuza'ah tribe, they disavow themselves of the Banu Bakr, or they should declare the truce of Hudaybiyyah null.|$|E
5|$|When {{a warrior}} is so old, or sustains an injury {{that means they}} can no longer serve their Clan, they retire to become elders. Elders live out the {{remainder}} of their life in general peace, using it as a time of rest and relaxation. They sleep in their own separate den, which is looked after by the apprentices. Elders are not expected to hunt or fight for their Clan, but are able to do so if the mood takes them. Their only expected duty is to carry the body of a deceased Clanmate to their grave. Every cat of the Clan respects and appreciates the elders, thanking them for the time they have spent upholding their roles as a warrior. Sadly, it is rare for <b>a</b> <b>Clan</b> to have more than three or four elders, as many warriors die before they can retire.|$|E
