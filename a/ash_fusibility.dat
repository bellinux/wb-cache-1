40|$|Abstract. It is {{significant}} {{for safe operation}} and energy saving to foreknow <b>ash</b> <b>fusibility</b> of coal. <b>Ash</b> <b>fusibility</b> of coal was divided into three levels according to softening temperature. The fusibility level was correlated with coal properties by a nonlinear classified model which was built using support vector machine. The model receives coal properties as input variables and would give a judgment of fusibility level as an output. Validation of the nonlinear classified model on 62 training samples yielded 100 % accuracy. The prediction accuracy of 15 testing samples was 86. 7 %. Results indicate {{that the level of}} <b>ash</b> <b>fusibility</b> can be accurately predicted from coal properties with the nonlinear classified model...|$|E
30|$|FactSage 6.4 {{thermochemical}} {{software and}} databases computer package {{was used in}} order to predict (1) the chemical composition of coal ash at equilibrium during combustion (2) simulation of mineral phase transformation from 800 to 1500  °C, and (3) the relationship between mineral phases and <b>ash</b> <b>fusibility.</b> Chemical analysis data of ash samples {{was used as the}} input for the FactSage calculations.|$|E
30|$|Conventionally, {{characterization}} of the <b>ash</b> <b>fusibility</b> is conducted using ASTM D 1857 procedure. It comprises monitoring cones or pyramids of ash—prepared in a muffle furnace at 815  °C—in an oven operated under a reducing atmosphere and whose temperature is continuously increased steadily past 1000  °C to as high as possible, preferably 1600  °C (2910  °F). It may be noted that for a given coal, the AFT analysis conducted by different laboratories may vary by[*]±[*] 20 – 100  °C (Jak 2002; Winegartner and Rhodes 1975).|$|E
30|$|Review {{of various}} ash {{sintering}} techniques {{was made by}} Raask [2]. The techniques provide some useful information regarding the deposit-forming propensity of the ashes but with some shortcomings {{in each of the}} techniques. The techniques are based on different <b>ash</b> properties, like <b>fusibility</b> of <b>ash,</b> viscosity, compression strength of ash pellets, empirical correlations based on elemental contents of the ash, and utilization of appropriated phase diagrams [3]. Detailed information of some of these methods could be found in [4]. With respect to sintering property of coal ash, the ash fusion test (AFT) tends to be rather imprecise and subjective while ash viscosity measurements, although more precise, require complex equipment and are not really suitable for routine testing [5]. Viscosity measurements of coal ash slag are difficult to carry out, and several different techniques would be required to cover the necessary range.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, several indices based on ash {{chemistry}} and <b>ash</b> <b>fusibility</b> {{have been used}} to predict the ash behaviour during coal combustion, namely, its tendency for slagging and fouling. However, due to the physicalechemical differences between coals and biomass, in this work only the applicability of an <b>ash</b> <b>fusibility</b> index (AFI) to the combustion and co-combustion of three types of biomass (straw pellets, olive cake and wood pellets) with coals was evaluated. The AFI values were compared with the behaviour of ash during combustion in a pilot fluidized bed and a close agreement was observed between them. For {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms associated with bed ash sintering, they were evaluated by SEM/EDS and the elements present on the melted ash were identified. Evidences of different sintering mechanisms were found out for the fruit biomass and herbaceous biomass tested, depending on the relative proportions of problematic elements. The particles deposited on a fouling probe inserted in the FBC were analyzed by XRD and the differences between the compounds identified allowed concluding that the studied biomasses present different tendencies for fouling. Identification of KCl and K 2 SO 4 in the deposits confirmed the higher tendency for fouling of fruit biomass tested rather than wood pellets...|$|E
40|$|Coal {{blending}} is {{an effective}} way to organize and control coal <b>ash</b> <b>fusibility</b> to meet different requirements of Coal-fired power plants. This study investigates three different eutectic processes and explains the mechanism of how coal blending affects <b>ash</b> <b>fusibility.</b> The blended ashes were prepared by hand-mixing two raw coal ashes at five blending ratios, G:D = 10 : 90 (G 10 D 90), G:D= 20 : 80 (G 20 D 80), G:D = 30 : 70 (G 30 D 70), G:D = 40 : 60 (G 40 D 60), and G:D = 50 : 50 (G 50 D 50). The samples were heated at 900 °C, 1000 °C, 1100 °C, 1200 °C, and 1300 °C in reducing atmosphere. XRD and SEM/EDX were used to identify mineral transformations and eutectic processes. The eutectic processes were finally simulated with FactSage. Results show that the fusion temperatures of the blended ashes initially decrease and then increase with the blending ratio, a trend that is typical of eutectic melting. Eutectic phenomena are observed in D 100, G 10 D 90, and G 30 D 70 in different degrees, which do not appear in G 100 and G 50 D 50 for the lack of eutectic reactants. The main eutectic reactants are gehlenite, magnetite, merwinite, and diopside. The FactSage simulation results show that the content discrepancy of merwinite and diopside in the ashes causes the inconsistent eutectic temperatures and eutectic degrees, in turn decrease the fusion temperature of the blended ash and then increase them with the blending ratio...|$|E
40|$|The ash fusion {{characteristics}} are important parameters for thermochemical utilization of biomass. In this research, {{a method for}} measuring the fusion characteristics of biomass ash by Thermo-mechanical Analyzer, TMA, is described. The typical TMA shrinking ratio curve {{can be divided into}} two stages, which are closely related to ash melting behaviors. Several characteristics temperatures based on the TMA curves are used to assess the ash fusion characteristics. A new characteristics temperature, T-m, is proposed to represent the severe melting temperature of biomass ash. The fusion characteristics of six types of biomass ash have been measured by TMA. Compared with standard <b>ash</b> <b>fusibility</b> temperatures (AFT) test, TMA is more suitable for measuring the fusion characteristics of biomass ash. The glassy molten areas of the ash samples are sticky and mainly consist of K-Ca-silicates. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. </p...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{common reed}} (Phragmites australis) {{has become a}} {{conservation}} problem in Estonia because it has spread into ecologically valuable habitats, out-competing other species and impacting on biodiversity values. Thus, the use of common reed as a biomass fuel may not only provide renewable energy, but also help in biodiversity conservation efforts. The properties of reed as a potential biofuel must be studied because the fuel handling method, the lifetime of combustion equipment (fouling, erosion and corrosion), combustion regimes and environmental impacts such as pollution, ash handling etc. depend on these properties. The combustion characteristics of reed vary to some extent depending both on the site where it grows (coastal area, lake, river delta or wetland treatment system) and seasonally (winter or summer harvesting). This paper {{presents the results of}} tests on reed properties including the chemical composition of summer and winter harvested reed and its ash, <b>ash</b> <b>fusibility</b> temperature, physical properties such as moisture and ash proportions, dry bulk density, calorific value and energy density. The impacts of different chemical and physical properties of reed on boiler operation are discussed...|$|E
30|$|Ash fusion {{temperatures}} help {{in identifying}} the slagging behavior of coal ash, which affects slag viscosity and refractory life. The main constituents of coal ash {{used in the present}} study are silica and alumina with small percentages of other oxides such as Fe 2 O 3, TiO 2, CaO, MgO, K 2 O and Na 2 O. The <b>ash</b> <b>fusibility</b> is reported to be a function of these major oxides. Higher quantity of acidic compounds (SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2) in coal ash contributes towards higher melting point. On the other hand, basic compounds in coal ash (Fe 2 O 3, CaO and MgO, Na 2 O and K 2 O) have a fluxing effect on SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3, thereby reducing the fusion point of ash. Liu et al. (2013) have reported that three major chemical compositions that affect the AFTs of coal samples are CaO, and Fe 2 O 3 content and SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio (S/A). AFTs decreases with increase of CaO and Fe 2 O 3 content and increase of S/A ratio till 1.5. Beyond the S/A value of 2.0, AFTs decrease marginally or remain unchanged (Liu et al. 2013). In the present case, the S/A ratio of three samples are higher than 2.0 (3.08, 2.70 and 2.99 for M 2, M 12, M 24) respectively, and for M 43, the S/A value is 1.99. Therefore the AFTs for all the coal samples are expected to be high. Furthermore, Fe 2 O 3 and CaO content of all the four samples are low, ruling out the possibility of lowering of AFTs. Indeed, the AFTs of M 2, M 12, M 24 and M 43 coal ash samples determined experimentally using ash fusion determination instrument was found to be very high. The initial deformation temperature (IDT) for all the four ash samples were higher than 1500  °C. The high AFT values are due to presence of high concentration of silica and alumina and appreciable amount of TiO 2 whose melting temperatures range between 1685 and 1775  °C (Borio and Levasseur 1984). Therefore, coal of the four seams of Tentulai Block, Talcher coalfield is good for combustion with very little possibility of <b>ash</b> <b>fusibility</b> at fuel bed of the boiler.|$|E
30|$|Investigations {{carried out}} on the coal samples of four {{different}} seams of a single borehole of the Tentuloi Block, Talcher coalfield, Orissa, India reveals that coals of all the four seams are similar in nature having high ash yields and low calorific values. The coal quality (FC content, GCV value) decreases marginally for the seam at higher depth. Mineral matter composition of the coal ash for the four coal seams were similar with SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 jointly accounting {{to a total of}} 92  %– 94  % of ash mass. The coal ash composition in terms of major components, SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, CaO, TiO 2, K 2 O and Fe 2 O 3 however varied considerably between the seam M 43 and other three seams, M 2, M 12 and M 24. AFTs of coal ashes of all the four coal seams were very high with IDT greater than 1500  °C. Therefore, it indicates that coal of the four seams of Tentulai Block, Talcher coalfield is good for combustion with very little possibility of <b>ash</b> <b>fusibility.</b> Heat treatment studies of coal samples at different temperatures indicate that the mineral matter present in coal samples get transformed to different phases at different temperatures. New phases like hematite, rutile, mullite and AlPO 4 were formed at 1000  °C. Finally, FactSage thermodynamic modeling studies were carried to corroborate the findings of heat treatment experiments. FactSage predictions and experimental results agree well regarding phase transformation of mineral maters during heat treatment process.|$|E
40|$|Macroalgae {{has emerged}} as a {{potential}} future source of feedstock for the production of chemicals and biofuels. The main drawback of macroalgae in terms of a biofuel feedstock is its low heating value (HHV), high halogen content, high ash content and high slagging and fouling propensity. In this investigation, three species of kelps; (i) Laminaria digitata (ii) Laminaria hyperborea and (iii) Alaria esculenta have been processed by hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) in a batch reactor at two temperatures (200 °C and 250 °C). The yields and properties of the resulting hydrochars including their HHV, CHNS, mineral content and <b>ash</b> <b>fusibility</b> properties have been determined and compared to the starting material. Significant improvement in fuel quality is observed resulting in an increase in energy density from 10 MJ/kg to typically 25 MJ/kg, which is comparable to that of a low rank coal. The results indicate significant demineralisation of the fuel, in particular a significant removal of alkali salts and chlorine. This results in improved combustion properties due to a reduction in the slagging and fouling properties of the fuel. Analysis of the HTC water phase indicates the presence of high levels of soluble organic carbon consisting of sugars and organic acids, and high levels of potassium, magnesium and phosphorous. The potential for production of bio-methane and recovery of nutrients following anaerobic treatment of the water phase is assessed. A prediction of the bio-methane yields for the different seaweeds has been calculated. Processing of biomass collected throughout the growth season indicates the influence of seasonal variation on energy and nutrient recovery...|$|E
40|$|Slagging and fouling {{during the}} {{combustion}} of pulverised coal in boilers {{is a major}} problem as power generators strive to improve the efficiency of plants. The coal type has a major influence on the slagging propensity in furnaces. The correlation between predicted results using some of the existing slagging indices and the actual observations made in most conventional boilers has been poor, especially when their use is extended to different coals. In this thesis, a numerical model to predict coal ash particle deposition rate in pulverized coal boilers has been developed. The overall sticking probability of the particle is determined by its viscosity and its tendency to rebound after impaction. The deposition model has been implemented in the Fluent 12. 1 software, and the effects of swirling motion ash particle viscosity on deposition rates have been investigated. The predicted results are in good agreement with the reported experimental measurements on the Australian bituminous coals. Also, a novel numerical slagging index (NSI) which is based on <b>ash</b> <b>fusibility,</b> ash viscosity and the content of ash in the coals has been developed. The incoming ash shows significant influence on slag accumulation in boilers. The results of assessment of the slagging potential using the NSI {{on a wide range of}} coals and some coal blends correlate very well with the reported field performance of the coals. The NSI has been modified to predict the slagging potential of some coal and biomass blends with < 20 % biomass ratio. The results of predictions using the modified index on coals blended with sewage sludge and saw-dust are in good agreement with the experimental data.

40|$|A {{series of}} high {{moisture}} content biomass have been processed by hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) in a batch reactor at two temperatures (200 °C and 250 °C). The feedstocks processed include food waste, secondary sewage sludge, AD press cake, microalgae, macroalgae and a fibre derived from municipal derived wastes. In addition, three lignocellulosic biomass including miscanthus, willow and oak wood have been processed under identical conditions. The yields and {{properties of the}} resulting hydrochars including their HHV, CHNS, mineral content and <b>ash</b> <b>fusibility</b> properties have been determined and compared with their starting biomass. Typical char yields for lignocellulosic material range between 58 - 70 wt% at 200 °C and reduce to 40 - 46 wt% at 250 °C. The behaviour and mass balance is however very feedstock dependent and the higher lignin biomass produce higher yields of hydrochar. There is a significant upgrading of the energy density of the hydrochars with calculated HHV ranging from typically 24 MJkg- 1 at 200 °C to 28 - 31 MJkg- 1 at 250 °C for lignocellulosic material. The exception is for sewage sludge and AD press cake which result in a significant solubilisation of organic matter. A significant removal of alkali metals is observed and this in turn changes the ash chemistry upon combustion. This change in ash chemistry {{has been shown to}} change the ash melting behaviour and the hemisphere temperatures (oxidizing conditions) were seen to increase substantially. A number of predictive slagging and fouling indices have been used to evaluate the influence of the ash chemistry on the fuel combustion behaviour and this combined with the ash fusion testing has shown that HTC reduces the potential fouling and slagging in some of the resulting hydochars if combusted...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} work {{developed in the}} present thesis deals with the upgrading of moist agroindustrial wastes by torrefaction and hydrothermal carbonization for their subsequent use as bioenergy feedstocks in industrial and domestic systems. The Mediterranean region concentrates the main producer countries of olive oil, canned foodstuffs and juices worldwide, and thus produces large amounts of moist agroindustrial wastes needing suitable management treatments. Unfortunately, their use in energy applications is not directly an efficient option, since this kind of wastes present moisture contents higher than 65 % and low energy density. Therefore, the main objective of the present work is to convert moist agroindustrial wastes in profitable materials {{that can be used}} in energy purposes. Low temperature treatments such as torrefaction (TF) and hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) were selected in order to maximize the solid recovery and minimize energy requirements and costs. On the one hand, torrefaction of olive mill waste was studied. On the other, hydrothermal carbonization of olive mill waste, artichoke wastes and orange juice wastes was studied as a potential alternative to dry treatments. Through these investigations, it was possible to bear out that HTC is more energy beneficial to treat moist agroindustrial wastes than TF, leading to energy savings up to 50 %. Then, since HTC was considered more appropriate than TF to manage this kind of wastes, following investigations were focused on a deeply study of the HTC process, hydrochar properties and its use in possible energy applications. The effect of lipids on the HTC process and hydrochar properties was studied and it was found that lipids, which mainly remain on the hydrochar, improve the hydrophobicity of the solid and thus reduce its moisture content, decreasing the total energy requirements of the global low temperature upgrading process. In addition, it was found that lipids retain antimicrobial liposoluble substances on the solid and thus improve the biodegradability of the HTC-liquor. Then, it was concluded that, although HTC is an effective treatment regardless the lipids loading, HTC is energetically and enviromentally more advantageous as the amount of lipids contained in the raw wastes increases. When considering the use of hydrochars as renewable fuels for both industrial and domestic applications, ashes behaviour and related emissions are important concerns. To improve <b>ash</b> <b>fusibility</b> characteristics of hydrochars, the composition of their ashes was modified with rice hulls and/or mineral additives. It was found that rice hulls and kaolin are able to increase the hydrochar ash fusion characteristic temperatures to values higher than 1500 ºC. The high cost of kaolin could limit its application. Thus, rice hulls were considered the best option among the additives studied, since consisting of a waste, allows reaching economic and sustainability criteria. Emissions associated with the combustion of hydrochars were assessed and compared with those associated with raw materials, torrefied materials (TF-chars) and conventional fuels (i. e., anthracite and wood). Experiments were conducted in both a lab-scale furnace and a commercial domestic pellet stove. Lab-scale experiments showed that hydrochar and TF-char lead to 40 % lower emissions of light hydrocarbons but 50 % higher emissions of SVOCs and PAHs than OMW. As compared with conventional fuels emissions of hydrochar and TF-chars were substantially higher than those associated with anthracite, whereas the toxicity factor of hydrochar was similar to that of wood. Experiments conducted in the domestic pellet stove showed that the toxicity associated with hydrochar was very similar to that of OMW, although it duplicated that of wood pellets. Hence, it is mandatory to ensure good combustion conditions to avoid the release of toxic compounds to the environment. Finally, the life cycle analysis (LCA) of HTC coupled with energy recovery from the hydrochar was conducted to determine its environmental implications and compare them with the impacts associated with current management options. Results indicated that HTC and subsequent energy generation is more beneficial than biological treatments. However, this scenario was less advantageous than direct incineration, due to the energy losses that occur during HTC and the discharge of HTC-liquor to the environment. Thus, it is recommended that future research efforts focus on the evaluation of appropriate HTC-liquor treatments and methods to improve the energy retention efficiencies of the hydrochar...|$|E
