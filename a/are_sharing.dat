When she leaves at the end of season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and O'Toole <b>are</b> <b>sharing</b> a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E

25|$|In general, one can {{say that}} the {{processes}} to make PET bottle flakes from collected bottles are as versatile as the different waste streams are different in their composition and quality.

25|$|Network effect {{relates to}} the {{intellectual}} commons in a positive way. Through P2P networks users are able to share their intellectual property {{in a way that}} can benefit society as a whole.The sharing of intellectual property ultimately relates to economic growth due to the ability for creators to share information and still possibly benefit financially from it. Through P2P networks people are able to share types of education like scholarly articles, becoming a new form of public commons. Network externality like Ted.com {{is an example of how}} intellectual commons with the use of network externality benefits society as a whole. Those who present intellectual property at Ted conferences <b>are</b> <b>sharing</b> their education on a public forum that benefits whoever will listen. Therefore, the larger Ted.com network becomes positively correlates to those who benefit from its common-pool resources.|$|E

25|$|In {{the last}} step of duplex {{sequencing}} library preparation, Illumina sequencing adapters {{are added to the}} tagged double stranded libraries by PCR amplification using primers containing sequencing adapters. During PCR amplification both complementary strands of DNA are amplified and generate two types of PCR products. Product 1 derive from strand 1 which have a unique tag sequence (called α in the figure 2) next to the Illumina adapter 1 and product 2 that have a unique tag (called β in the figure 2) next to illumina adapter 1. (Please note that in each strand, tag a is the retrograde, complementary version of tag b and vice versa). The libraries containing duplex tags and Illumina adapters are sequenced using Illumina TruSeq system. Reads that are originating from each single strand of DNA form a group of reads (tag families) that <b>are</b> <b>sharing</b> the same tag. The detected families of reads will be used in next step for analyzing sequencing data.|$|E

2500|$|In popular music, amateur and {{professional}} bands from styles {{as varied as}} country and heavy metal use electronic tuners {{to ensure that the}} guitars and electric bass are correctly tuned.

Electronic tuners are helpful aids at jam sessions where a number of players <b>are</b> <b>sharing</b> the stage, because it helps all of the players to have their instruments tuned to the same pitch, even if they have come to the session halfway through. Tuners are helpful with acoustic instruments, because they are more affected by temperature and humidity changes. An acoustic guitar or upright bass that is perfectly in tune backstage can change in pitch under the heat of the stage lights and from the humidity from thousands of audience members.|$|E
