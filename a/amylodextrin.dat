5000|$|Amylase {{is found}} in saliva and breaks starch into maltose and dextrin. This form of amylase is also called [...] "ptyalin" [...] It will break large, {{insoluble}} starch molecules into soluble starches (<b>amylodextrin,</b> erythrodextrin, and achrodextrin) producing successively smaller starches and ultimately maltose. Ptyalin acts on linear α(1,4) glycosidic linkages, but compound hydrolysis requires an enzyme that acts on branched products. Salivary amylase is inactivated in the stomach by gastric acid. In gastric juice adjusted to pH 3.3, ptyalin was totally inactivated in 20 minutes at 37 °C. In contrast, 50% of amylase activity remained after 150 minutes of exposure to gastric juice at pH 4.3. Both starch, the substrate for ptyalin, and the product (short chains of glucose) are able to partially protect it against inactivation by gastric acid. Ptyalin added to buffer at pH 3.0 underwent complete inactivation in 120 minutes; however, addition of starch at a 0.1% level resulted in 10% of the activity remaining, and similar addition of starch to a 1.0% level resulted in about 40% of the activity remaining at 120 minutes.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} <b>amylodextrin</b> (a linear dextrin) {{to act as}} a {{complexing}} agent or as a carrier for solid dispersion was evaluated. Blends of <b>amylodextrin</b> with diazepam or prednisolone were freeze-dried and kneaded at elevated temperatures, respectively. The products were analyzed by DSC, X-ray diffractometry, and FTIR spectroscopy. Complex formation with <b>amylodextrin</b> by freeze-drying was found not to occur for diazepam but for prednisolone at a molar ratio of 1 to 1. The freeze-dried product of diazepam with <b>amylodextrin</b> proved to be a solid dispersion. Solid dispersions were formed by both wet (with ethanol) and dry kneading at elevated temperatures of low-melting drugs such as lidocain, diazepam, and methyl-PABA with <b>amylodextrin.</b> No solid dispersions were obtained for high-melting drugs such as prednisolone and salicylic acid. The results point to the formation of solid dispersions by a melting mechanism during the process of kneading at elevated temperatures of low-melting drugs with <b>amylodextrin...</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Amylodextrin,</b> {{metastable}} amylodextrins, Amylose V and metastable amylose {{were investigated}} on their dry binding properties. Amylose V showed poor binding properties. Both <b>amylodextrin</b> and metastable <b>amylodextrin</b> produced tablets showing crushing strengths comparable with microcrystalline cellulose, whereas tablets compressed from metastable amylose even showed crushing strengths which {{were more than}} 2 -fold greater. Both <b>amylodextrin</b> and metastable amylose showed a granular structure composed of very small primary particles (mean diameter 1 - 2 mu m). During compression the granulates disaggregated into the primary particles. The latter deformed plastically followed by the formation of hydrogen bonds.

Neither <b>amylodextrin</b> nor metastable amylose showed susceptibility for magnesium stearate, while Amylose V did show sensitivity for this lubricant. The difference is explained by the higher specific surface area and poorer flowing properties of <b>amylodextrin</b> and metastable amylose, as compared to Amylose V...|$|E
40|$|Moisture {{influences}} the consolidation behaviour of <b>amylodextrin</b> powders and the porosity and mechanical strength of compacts thereof. The {{aim of this}} study is to relate moisture content and compact properties to drug release characteristics of <b>amylodextrin</b> tablets. Therefore, <b>amylodextrin</b> tablets containing theophylline monohydrate were prepared and their release characteristics were studied as a function of moisture content and initial porosity. Drug release from <b>amylodextrin</b> tablets occurs through a leaching mechanism in which cracks are progressively formed in the hydrated part of the matrix leading to almost constant release rates. Small variations in moisture content resulted in large changes of the release rate. A unique relationship between porosity and release rate, which was independent on moisture content and compaction pressure, was observed. Above a critical porosity of 0. 075 crack formation was followed by disintegration and fast release. Below this critical porosity, tablet:; stayed intact despite of the formation of cracks, and sustained release was observed. It is concluded that control over moisture content is essential for the production of <b>amylodextrin</b> tablets with reproducible release characteristics. Using <b>amylodextrin</b> containing 10 - 17 % moisture, tablets with a constant release behaviour can be obtained if sufficient compaction pressure (> 300 MPa) is applied. Lubrication of <b>amylodextrin</b> powders reduces the effect of porosity significantly and improves the robustness of <b>amylodextrin</b> tablets as a release controlling excipient in tablets largely.

Diazepam release from capsules was slightly increased on application of <b>amylodextrin,</b> either as a filler in a physical mixture or as a carrier for solid dispersion of the drug, {{as compared to the}} release from capsules containing drug only. The limited increase in drug dissolution is caused by the limited solubility of <b>amylodextrin.</b> Application of the soluble fraction of <b>amylodextrin</b> therefore showed faster drug release.

After entering the aqueous phase they partially dissolve. The suppositories showed increased drug release compared with the corresponding suppositories containing drug only. Because of the partial solubility of <b>amylodextrin,</b> drug release was lower than the release from drug-cyclodextrin complexes.

Physical mixtures of <b>amylodextrin</b> with the model compounds theophylline, paracetamol, methyl-PABA, prednisolone, atrazine, procaine HCl and potassium dichromate, respectively, were compressed into almost non-porous tablets and tested on their release profile, determined at pH 6. 8 in the USP XXI paddle apparatus. All tablets did not disintegrate and showed almost constant release rates. Zero-order release of paracetamol was not affected by pH and ionic strength of the dissolution medium. Lubrication with magnesium stearate was found not to impair the release profile of potassium dichromate-amylodextrin tablets. Zero-order release from the <b>amylodextrin</b> tablets is explained by the mechanism of water penetration into the polymer associated with polymeric relaxations controlling the drug diffusional release.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Amylodextrin,</b> a starch-based {{controlled}} release excipient, spontaneously absorbs moisture during storage. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate plasticisation of <b>amylodextrin</b> by moisture and its effect on compaction and tablet characteristics. Methods: The glass transition temperature (T-g) of <b>amylodextrin</b> powders with moisture fractions (T-g) 0. 070 <x(w) < 0. 40 was studied by conventional and modulated DSC. Elastic modulus and yield stress were determined from compressive stress-strain experiments. Compaction behaviour was studied at 3 and 300 mm/s using a compaction simulator. Results: The T-g of amylodextrin-water blends showed a smooth reduction with increasing x(w) equalling room temperature at x(w) = 0. 19. Experimentally obtained T-g values were close to temperatures as predicted by the Gordon-Taylor/Kelley-Bueche model and the modified Couchman-Karasz model. The elastic modulus decreased steeply between x(w) = 0. 17 and 0. 23. Compaction experiments showed that moisture facilitated consolidation due to increasing powder compressibility and reduced compact relaxation. However. at x(w) = 0. 23, compressibility was reduced and relaxation significantly higher due to the rubbery character of this powder. Consequently, the lowest tablet porosities were obtained around x(w) = 0. 15. Although decreasing porosities enhanced tablet strengths, the maximum obtainable tablet strengths decreased with moisture due to reduced particle bonding and lowering of the elastic modulus. Conclusion: Moisture largely affects the visco-elastic and compaction characteristics of <b>amylodextrin.</b> Hence, control over moisture content is essential to produce tablets with reproducible porosity, strength and dissolution characteristics.

40|$|Background: The malQ and glgP genes, respectively, {{annotated}} as putative 4 -&#x 03 B 1;-glucanotransferase and putative {{glycogen phosphorylase}} are located with a 29 nucleotide overlap on the Streptococcus mutans genome.

This putative operon was negatively regulated with the malR gene located upstream from the malQ gene and a MalR-binding consensus sequence was found upstream of the malQ gene. S. mutans {{is not able to}} catabolize starch. However, this organism utilizes maltose degraded from starch in the presence of saliva amylase. Therefore, we hypothesized that the MalQ/GlgP system may participate in the metabolism of starch-degradation products. Methods: A DNA fragment amplified from the malQ or glgP gene overexpressed His-tagged proteins with the plasmid pBAD/HisA. S. mutans malQ and/or glgP mutants were also constructed. Purified proteins were assayed for glucose-releasing and phosphorylase activities with appropriate buffers containing maltose, maltotriose, maltodextrin, or <b>amylodextrin</b> as a substrate, and were photometrically assayed with a glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase&#x 2013;NADP system. Results: Purified MalQ protein released glucose from maltose and maltotriose but did not from either maltodextrin or <b>amylodextrin.</b> The purified GlgP protein did not exhibit a phosphorylase reaction with maltose or maltotriose but generated glucose- 1 -phosphate from maltodextrin and <b>amylodextrin.</b> However, the GlgP protein released glucose- 1 -phosphate from maltose and maltotriose {{in the presence of the}} MalQ protein.

40|$|Introduction Corn (Zea mays L.) {{is one of}} {{the main}} cereals in the {{tropical}} and temperate regions of the world. Sweet corn obtained from a genetic mutation on chromosome 4 locus SU conventional maize resulting accumulation of sugars and polysaccharides which are soluble in seed endosperm. Unlike other types of corn, sweet corn endosperm contains a lot of sugar to starch, which is called <b>Amylodextrin</b> and it is soluble in water. Producing healthy and uniform plants {{is one of the}} requirements of modern agriculture. Considering the unsuitable climatic condition in Iran (arid and semiarid) transplantation is one of the requirements for sustainable agriculture particularly in sweet corn production with high water requirement where transplantation is able to save at least 2 - 3 times of irrigations. Therefore, producing high quality transplants is an important practice for successful seedling establishment. Hence, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of seed priming and substrate types on the characteristics of sweet corn transplants. Materials and Methods This experiment was conducted as factorial based on a completely randomized design with three replications. Treatments were three levels of seeds pretreatment: no priming (p 1), hydropriming (p 2) and biopriming (p 3), and another factor was seedbeds types in seven levels including: vermicompost (b 1), perlite (b 2), cocopeat(b 3), vermicompost+perlite(b 4), vermicompost+ cocopeat (b 5), perlite+ cocopeat (b 6) and vermicompost+ cocopeat +perlite (b 7). Biopriming using bioaminopalis biological fertilizer applied on the seeds for 24 hours in a solution containing micro-organisms such azotobacter and Pseudomonas. Then the non-primed and the primed seeds were sown in the plastic pots and grown in a greenhouse with average temperature of 22 - 25 ° C. Samples were taken three weeks after planting. Results and Discussion Mean emergence time Emergence is shoot elongation and growth leading the shoots out of the soil. Shorter mean emergence time indicates the plants emergence more quickly as a desirable characteristic. Results from analysis of variance showed that the mean emergence time was significantly influenced by seed priming treatments (P≤ 0. 01). The type of seedbed and interaction of two factors, seedbed and priming had no significant effect on mean emergence time (Table 1). Non treated seeds (P 1) had the longest mean emergence time of 3. 06 days compared with treated seeds (P 2, P 3) (Table 2). Shoot length The results showed that the type of the seedbed and seed priming pretreatment had a significant effect on the shoot length on the sweet corn transplants. The interaction between these two factors on shoot length was also significant (Table 1). Bioprimed seeds produced transplants with 17. 86 cm shoot length superior to the non-primed seeds, while it did not show statistically significant difference with the hydroprimed seeds. Sweet corn seeds inoculation with bacteria resulted a significant increase in the seedling shoot length. Sayed-Sharifi and Khavazi (2011) also found similar results. Seed bed also had a significant effect on sweet corn seedling shoot length. As the vermicompost + cocopeat and vermicompost seedbeds produced seedlings with shoot length of 21 and 20. 68 cm respectively, while perlite+coco peat and perlite showed the lowest shoot length of 10. 98 and 11. 08 respectively (table 2). Nicknam et al. (2012) also investigated the influence of different substrates on the growth of two cultivars of lily (Lilium ledebourii) and found that seedbeds containing vremikvlayt and perlite produced transplants with a shorter shoot length. P 3 b 5 treatment where the seeds primed with microorganisms such as pseudomonas and the seedlings grown in the vermicompost resulted in the highest (24 cm) shoot length possibly due to more availability of the nutrients while P 1 b 2 treatments produced the shortest (9. 9 cm) shoot length seedlings (Figure 1) Leaf area The seeds pretreatment (P≤ 0. 05), the kind of seedbed and the interactions between these factors (P≤ 0. 01) have significant effect on the sweet corn leaf area (Table 1). The seedlings of the bioprimed seeds produced a higher leaf area of 60. 65 cm 2 compared with the control and hydropriming treatments possibly due to more availability of the nutrients. Seed pretreatment with biological fertilizer of bioaminopalis that contained bacteria, azotobacter and pseudomonas had direct and indirect effects on plant growth leading to expansion of the leaf area. The direct effects of these bacteria could be used in producing chemical components needed for plant growth, facilitating nutrients uptake, atmospheric nitrogen fixation and plant hormones production such as auxin and gibberellins, enhancing plant growth in various stages of development, or construction of enzymes involved in the plant growth. Conclusions Seed priming and vermicompost seedbed improved the quality of the produced transplants. This system was recommended for sweet corn production in Iran using transplants in order to save at least 2 - 3 times of the irrigation per year where the country is suffering from serious water crises...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{understand}} effects of different treatments and modifications on the structures, properties, and digestibility of selected starches. Different lipids, including corn oil (CO), soy lecithin (SL), palmitic acid (PA), stearic acid (SA), oleic acid (OA) and linoleic acid (LA), {{were selected for}} the study, and their impacts on the properties and digestibility of normal corn (NCS), tapioca (TPS), waxy corn (WCS) and high-amylose corn (HA 7) starch were investigated to elucidate mechanisms of starch-lipid interactions. After cooking with the lipids (10 %, w/w, dsb), NCS, TPS and HA 7 showed significant decreases in the percentage enzymatic hydrolysis, and their DSC thermograms displayed an amylose-lipid-complex dissociation peak except the one cooked with the CO. 13 C-NMR spectra of <b>amylodextrin</b> {{with the presence of}} CO showed downfield changes in the chemical shifts of carbons 1 and 4 of the anhydroglucose unit, indicating helical-complex formation. In general, free fatty acids (FFAs) reduced, but SL increased the peak viscosity of starch. FFAs and SL decreased, but CO increased the gel strength of NCS. All the lipids displayed little impacts on the digestibility and properties of WCS because it lacked amylose. Resistant starch Type 5 (RS 5) was prepared by complexing debranched HA 7 with SA. Because of amylose-helical-complex formation with SA, the RS 5 showed restricted swelling of starch granules at 95 Â°C. The RS 5 displayed a larger RS-content (67. 8 %) than the HA 7 (33. 5 %) and NCS (0. 8 %) analyzed using the AOAC Method 991. 43. When the cooked RS 5, HA 7 and NCS were used to prepare diets for rats with 55 % (w/w) starch content, RS contents of the diets were 33. 7 %, 15. 8 % and 2. 6 %, respectively. After feeding to the rats in Week 1, ~ 16 % of the starch in the RS 5 -diet was found in the feces, substantially greater than that of the HA 7 -diet (~ 6 %) and NCS-diet (0. 1 %). The percentage of starch not being utilized in the RS 5 -diet decreased to ~ 5 % in Week 9, which could be partially attributed to the fermentation of RS 5 by gut microflora. Large proportions (68 %- 99 %) of the SA in RS 5 -diet remained unabsorbed and were discharged in the rat feces. Effects of octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) modification of the NCS and HA 7 on their digestibility were examined. After the modification with 3 % and 10 % OSA, RS contents of the cooked OS-NCS increased from 0. 8 % of the control starch to 6. 8 % and 13. 2 % (Englyst Method), respectively, whereas that of the cooked OS-HA 7 decreased from 24. 1 % to 23. 7 % and 20. 9 %, respectively. When the cooked NCS, HA 7 and OS (10 %) -HA 7 were used to prepare diets for rats at 55 % (w/w) starch, RS contents of the diets were 1. 1 %, 13. 2 % and 14. 6 %, respectively. After feeding to the rats, 20 %- 31 % of the starch in the OS (10 %) -HA 7 -diet was not utilized in vivo and was found in rat feces, which was substantially larger than that of the HA 7 -diet (≤ 5 %) and NCS-diet (≤ 0. 2 %). Characteristics of starch and ethanol production of five sorghum lines (6 B 73, 6 C 21, 6 C 69, 7 R 34, and X 789) were investigated and compared with that of B 73 corn. Sorghum starches displayed higher gelatinization-temperatures (66. 6 - 67. 4 Â°C), greater gelatinization enthalpy-changes (13. 0 - 14. 0 J/g) and percentages retrogradation (60. 7 - 69. 1 %), but slower enzymatic-hydrolysis rates (83. 8 - 87. 8 % at 48 h) than the B 73 corn starch (61. 7 Â°C, 10. 1 J/g, 51. 5 %, and 88. 5 %, respectively). These differences could result from that the sorghum amylopectins consisted of fewer short branch-chains (DP 6 - 12) (12. 8 - 14. 0 %) than the corn amylopectin (15. 0 %). After 96 h fermentation, most ground sorghums exhibited lower ethanol-yields (30. 5 - 31. 8 %) than the ground B 73 corn (31. 8 %). Structure, properties, and digestibility of starch isolated from bamboo seeds (Bambusa textilis species) were studied and compared with that of indica and japonica-rice starch. The bamboo seeds also had compound starch granules, with morphology and sizes comparable to the rice starches. The amylopectin of bamboo-seed starch showed similar branch-chain-length distribution to that of the indica-rice starch, and both of them had longer branch-chains (DP = 19. 1 and 19. 7, respectively) than the japonica-rice amylopectin (DP = 17. 1). Consequently, the bamboo-seed and indica-rice starch granules exhibited higher gelatinization-temperatures (To = 68. 9 Â°C and 71. 9 Â°C, respectively), larger enthalpy-changes (ΔH = 14. 2 J/g and 15. 3 J/g) and percentages of retrogradation (57. 1 % and 55. 4 %), but slower enzymatic-hydrolysis rates (50. 6 % and 46. 3 % at 24 h) than the japonica-rice starch counterpart (56. 4 Â°C, 14. 0 J/g, 11. 4 %, and 66. 2 %, respectively) ...|$|E
