5|$|Kesselring {{was back}} where he started. Park's {{handling}} of the actions was <b>a</b> <b>masterpiece</b> of aggressive defence, yet he was not under the same pressure {{as he had been}} in the battles during August when air battles were so confusing they were hard to control. A big set-piece offensive played into his hands.|$|E
5|$|The Art of War is {{traditionally}} ascribed to Sun Tzu. It presents {{a philosophy of}} war for managing conflicts and winning battles. It is accepted as <b>a</b> <b>masterpiece</b> on strategy and has been frequently cited and referred to by generals and theorists since it was first published, translated, and distributed internationally.|$|E

5|$|A {{tradition}} of making batik {{is found in}} various countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and Nigeria; the batik of Indonesia, however, may be the best-known. Indonesian batik made in the island of Java {{has a long history}} of acculturation, with diverse patterns influenced by a variety of cultures, and is the most developed in terms of pattern, technique, and the quality of workmanship. In October 2009, UNESCO designated Indonesian batik as <b>a</b> <b>Masterpiece</b> of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.|$|E
5|$|Bush was not {{a natural}} melodist à la Dvorák, though he could produce an {{appealing}} tune when he set his mind to it. But he was a first-rate contrapuntist, and his harmonic world can glow with a rare internal warmth. It {{would be foolish to}} claim that everything he wrote was <b>a</b> <b>masterpiece</b> – and equally idiotic to turn our backs on the many outstanding scores still awaiting assiduous attention.|$|E
5|$|Hugh was {{not well}} known as a scholar. He did, however, serve as a patron to Roger of Hoveden, the medieval chronicler who started writing about 1169. He also {{commissioned}} two large Bibles, one of which still remains at Durham and is considered <b>a</b> <b>masterpiece</b> of book creation. This is Durham Cathedral Library Manuscript A.

5|$|In the mid-1920s, Ornstein left New York {{to accept}} a {{teaching}} post at the Philadelphia Musical Academy, later part of the University of the Arts. During this period, he wrote {{some of his most}} important work, including the Piano Concerto, commissioned by the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1925. Two years later, he produced his Piano Quintet. An epic tonal work marked by an adventurous use of dissonance and complex rhythmic arrangements, it is recognized as <b>a</b> <b>masterpiece</b> of the genre.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by the author's {{participation}} in the Allied bombing of the monastery at Monte Cassino during World War II, the novel is considered <b>a</b> <b>masterpiece</b> by literary critics. It has been compared favorably with the works of Evelyn Waugh, Graham Greene, and Walker Percy, and its themes of religion, recurrence, and church versus state have generated a significant body of scholarly research.|$|E

The film won the Silver Lion Award at the 1953 Venice Film Festival and other honours.

It is credited with simultaneously helping to popularise Japanese cinema in the West and influencing later Japanese film.|$|E
5|$|The Pontcysyllte Aqueduct {{was built}} by Thomas Telford in 1805 and is the largest {{aqueduct}} in the United Kingdom; it carries the Llangollen Canal over the River Dee and is a World Heritage Site, being considered <b>a</b> <b>masterpiece</b> of civil engineering. The Clwydian Range and Dee Valley constitute an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, one of just five {{in the whole of}} Wales. Denbigh, Colwyn and Ruthin are historic towns and Llangollen hosts the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod in July each year.|$|E
5|$|Another old {{building}} of note is the half-timbered Håndværkerhuset (at Kattesunded 20) from c.1625, which originally housed {{a number of}} warehouses. It is now used as a centre for arts and crafts. Finally, the headquarters of Danish Distillers (De Danske Spritfabrikker), {{to the west of}} the Limfjord Bridge, is noted for its Neoclassical appearance. Completed in 1931 by the architect Alf Cock-Clausen, it combines functionality with decorative classical symbolism. Considered <b>a</b> <b>masterpiece</b> of Danish factory design, it is now a Danish National Heritage site. When the factory closed in 2014, was the area bought by an investor, who will use the buildings to create an international culture city with museums, theatres, apartments etc.|$|E

5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. <b>A</b> <b>masterpiece</b> of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. It {{was supposed to be a}} figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E
5|$|In April 1883 Carvalho finally revived Carmen at the Opéra-Comique, with Adèle Isaac {{featuring}} in an under-rehearsed {{production that}} removed {{some of the}} controversial aspects of the original. Carvalho was roundly condemned by the critics for offering a travesty of what {{had come to be}} regarded as <b>a</b> <b>masterpiece</b> of French opera; nevertheless, this version was acclaimed by the public and played to full houses. In October Carvalho yielded to pressure and revised the production; he brought back Galli-Marié, and restored the score and libretto to their 1875 forms.|$|E
5|$|Sato {{estimated}} the game's budget at US$3–5 million. He {{said that the}} development team intended to make Silent Hill <b>a</b> <b>masterpiece</b> rather than a traditional sales-oriented game, and that they opted for an engaging story, which would persist over time – similar to successful literature. The game debuted at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, where the presentations of movies and in-game scenes garnered applause from the audience. This favorable reception persuaded Konami to allot more personnel and public relation initiatives to the project. Konami later showcased Silent Hill at the European Computer Trade Show in London, and included a demo with its stealth game Metal Gear Solid in Japan.|$|E

5|$|The Palais Rohan (Rohan Palace) in Strasbourg is {{the former}} {{residence}} of the prince-bishops and cardinals of the House of Rohan, an ancient French noble family originally from Brittany. It is a major architectural, historical, and cultural landmark in the city. It was built next to Strasbourg Cathedral in the 1730s, from designs by Robert de Cotte, and is considered <b>a</b> <b>masterpiece</b> of French Baroque architecture. Since its completion in 1742, the palace has hosted a number of French monarchs such as Louis XV, Marie Antoinette, Napoleon and Joséphine, and Charles X.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{has been}} called <b>a</b> <b>masterpiece</b> depiction of a battle scene, and {{much more than a}} simple depiction of a bloody battle. It is a complex picture, requiring more than a cursory look; a French critic, viewing it in Paris in 1879, declared that it was a museum in its own right, requiring eight days of study before one could properly appreciate it. At the same time, critics have pointed to the unrealistic depiction of the battle, and some anachronistic accessories present in the painting. Others have criticized the painting for being too crowded and chaotic.|$|E
5|$|Upon its creation, the {{painting}} did not gather much attention, and {{was acquired by}} the Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts for a purpose of a gift lottery. It was subsequently won by a certain individual, Korytko, in whose possession it was slightly damaged. Upon Matejko's raise to fame, {{the painting}} was rediscovered and applauded as <b>a</b> <b>masterpiece,</b> and acquired by the Warsaw National Museum in 1924. During World War II it was looted by the Nazis. It was subsequently seized by the Soviet Union and returned to Poland around 1956.|$|E
