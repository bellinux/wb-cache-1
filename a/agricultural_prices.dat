5|$|During the 12th century major landowners {{tended to}} rent out their demesne lands for money, {{motivated}} by static prices for produce and {{the chaos of}} the Anarchy between 1135 and 1153. This practice began to alter in the 1180s and 1190s, spurred by the greater political stability. In the first years of John's reign, <b>agricultural</b> <b>prices</b> almost doubled, at once increasing the potential profits on the demesne estates and also increasing the cost of living for the landowners themselves. Landowners now attempted wherever possible to bring their demesne lands back into direct management, creating a system of administrators and officials to run their new system of estates.|$|E
5|$|Although men {{and money}} had been secured, the markets {{component}} of the Bruce plan was never fully realised. At the 1923 Imperial Economic Conference, Bruce lobbied consistently for the Conservative government of Stanley Baldwin to make changes to Great Britain's trading arrangements to give preference to dominion products over imports from other nations. He argued for Empire-wide economic trading arrangements that filled domestic demands by production from member states before seeking supplemental imports from other countries and empires. Baldwin and the Conservatives attempted to introduce such a scheme in Britain; however, the British public feared higher prices for basic products (particularly food), and this fear {{was a factor in}} the Conservative government's defeat in the election of December 1923. Baldwin's successor Ramsay MacDonald repudiated the plan, much to Bruce's chagrin, and attempts to revive negotiations foundered as economic conditions worsened throughout the decade. World <b>agricultural</b> <b>prices</b> stalled in the mid-1920s as European and American agricultural production recovered to pre-war levels, and Australian exports were crowded out of markets as the decade progressed.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the passage}} of the Bland–Allison Act in 1878, there had been little {{discussion}} of gold versus silver coinage. Silver had been hardly mentioned in the 1888 campaign, and Harrison's exact position on the issue was initially unclear, but his appointment of a silverite Treasury Secretary, William Windom, encouraged the free silver supporters. Silver supporters' numbers had grown in Congress with the addition of new Western states. The drop in <b>agricultural</b> <b>prices,</b> which made farmers' debts harder to pay, broadened their cause's appeal. Harrison attempted to steer a middle course between the two positions, advocating a free coinage of silver, but at its own value, not at a fixed ratio to gold. This served only to disappoint both factions. Windom suggested keeping the Bland–Allison system, but doubling the amount of silver allowed to be coined. The intrinsic value of the silver dollar had fallen to 72.3 cents, but Windom believed (though gold supporters doubted) that coining more silver would increase demand and raise its value. Harrison was willing to sign whatever bill would satisfy the largest group of people, as long as it did not make the currency unsound.|$|E

5|$|The English cloth {{industry}} grew considerably at {{the start}} of the 15th century, and a new class of international English merchant emerged, typically based in London or the South-West, prospering at the expense of the older, shrinking economies of the eastern towns. These new trading systems brought about the end of many of the international fairs and the rise of the chartered company. Fishing in the North Sea expanded into deeper waters, backed by commercial investment from major merchants. Between 1440 and 1480, however, Europe entered a recession and England suffered the Great Slump: trade collapsed, driving down <b>agricultural</b> <b>prices,</b> rents and ultimately the acceptable levels of royal taxation.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the development and}} evolution of Malaysian <b>agricultural</b> <b>pricing</b> policies in relation to rubber, oil palm, and paddy for the period 1960 to 1983. Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} tracing the political pressures that generated and sustained these policies. The magnitude of these pricing policies is measured in terms of the nominal and effective rates of protection they generate; their impact on output, consumption, and foreign exchange earnings is then estimated; and finally, the implications of these policies for the government budget and the incomes of rural households are assessed. It is shown that the <b>agricultural</b> <b>pricing</b> policies have been remarkably stable over this period. These policies have ensured that the price of paddy relative to non-agricultural prices has increased slightly over time. While the rubber and the palm oil sectors have been taxed, substantial funds have been spent on research, replanting, and rural infrastructure that have promoted rural development and the expansion of these export crops.

Three lines of policy helped especially to raise rural incomes. The first was to use generous guaranteed prices for key food products. The second was to provide greatly increased agricultural credit, financed essentially by credit from the Central Bank. The third was to exempt most of the non-guaranteed <b>agricultural</b> <b>prices</b> from controls, allowing their prices to rise sharply relative to those of industrial products from the modern sector. From July 1985 to December 1986, prices {{of goods and services}} not under control increased more than three times as much as those under control.

25|$|Two {{years into}} his presidency, Monroe faced an {{economic}} crisis known as the Panic of 1819, the first major depression to hit the country since the 1780s. The panic stemmed from declining imports and exports, and sagging <b>agricultural</b> <b>prices</b> as global markets readjusted to peacetime production and commerce {{in the aftermath of}} the War of 1812 and the Napoleonic Wars. The severity of the economic downturn in the U.S. was compounded by excessive speculation in public lands, fueled by the unrestrained issue of paper money from banks and business concerns. Monroe lacked the power to intervene directly in the economy, as banks were largely regulated by the states, and he could do little to stem the economic crisis. The resulting high unemployment and an increase in bankruptcies and foreclosures provoked popular resentment against banking and business enterprises. It also exacerbated tensions within the Democratic-Republican Party and aggravated sectional tensions as northerners pressed for higher tariffs while southerners abandoned their support of nationalistic economic programs.|$|E
40|$|<b>Agricultural</b> <b>price</b> {{policies}} and allied instruments evolved in India {{in the context}} of shortages and excess demand during World War II (India 1975). Procurement and distribution of major foodgrains were begun and statutory maximum prices were set, though not strictly enforced.

Minimum prices were announced for wheat, jowar, rice, and maize in 1954 - 55 when prices started falling sharply (Chopra 1981). The recommendations of the Foodgrain Prices Committee, also known as the Jha Committee, in 1964 provided the foundation for a sound <b>agricultural</b> <b>price</b> policy and a systematic determination of producer prices of major foodgrains and maximum wholesale and retail prices (India 1965 a).

40|$|This paper {{includes}} {{the concepts of}} land rent {{from the standpoint of}} modern economics and accounts for the contributing factors {{in the formation of the}} <b>agricultural</b> land <b>price</b> during the pre-war and the post-war periods. It can be said the <b>agricultural</b> land <b>price</b> in the later Taisho period was conditioned by farm rent and as far as the pure farming region is concerned, the <b>agricultural</b> land <b>price</b> in the post-war period is also explained considerably by net returns per 10 ares of land, which is capitalized by an 8 percent interest rate. Furthermore, the increase in <b>agricultural</b> land <b>price,</b> based on the premises of constant return to scale and the supported price of farm products, has demonstrated that the rise in the <b>agricultural</b> land <b>price</b> is sufficiently explained by technological progress in rice production. Though various factors are considered important in the contribution to the formation of the <b>agricultural</b> land <b>price</b> in this paper the main emphasis is based upon the fact that the interior factors of agriculture considerably elucidate its formation throughout the pre-war and the post-war period.
