Following the Air Force, Barbree began his {{broadcast}} journalism career at WALB in Albany, Georgia where, in 1957, he saw Sputnik's spent booster rocket orbiting in the sky and then wrote radio and TV reports about the Soviet Union's launch of the first <b>artificial</b> <b>satellite.</b>|$|E

It also located Sputnik 2's carrier rocket at just after midnight on 16 November 1957.|$|E
5|$|On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union {{launched}} Sputnik 1, {{the first}} <b>artificial</b> <b>satellite.</b> This shattered American confidence in its technological superiority, creating {{a wave of}} anxiety known as the Sputnik crisis. Among his responses, President Dwight D. Eisenhower launched the Space Race. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was established on October 1, 1958, as a civilian agency to develop space technology. One of its first initiatives was publicly announced on December 17, 1958. This was Project Mercury, which aimed to launch a man into Earth orbit, return him safely to the Earth, and evaluate his capabilities in space.|$|E

40|$|Among {{the methods}} {{proposed}} for anti-asteroid {{protection of the}} Earth, gravitational control of the flights of meteorites {{by a group of}} <b>artificial</b> <b>satellites</b> is the most secure and environmentally safe. In this method, a threatening asteroid or meteorite is es-corted by a system of <b>artificial</b> <b>satellites</b> controlled from the Earth. Calculations have shown that five such satellites forming a chain can shift considerably the center of the asteroid mass and thereby change its trajectory. For multiple corrections of the flight of an asteroid, several “parades ” of its <b>artificial</b> <b>satellites</b> are necessary...|$|R

5|$|The station can be {{seen from}} the Earth with the naked eye and, as of , is the largest <b>artificial</b> <b>satellite</b> in Earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any {{previous}} space station. The Soyuz spacecraft delivers crew members, stays docked for their half-year-long missions and then returns them home. Several uncrewed cargo spacecraft service the ISS, they are the Russian Progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000, the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) since 2008, the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) since 2009, the American Dragon spacecraft since 2012, and the American Cygnus spacecraft since 2013. The Space Shuttle, before its retirement, was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members, although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay. Until another US manned spacecraft is ready, crew members will travel to and from the International Space Station exclusively aboard the Soyuz. The highest number of people occupying the ISS has been thirteen; this occurred three times during the late Shuttle ISS assembly missions.|$|E

40|$|Astronomers' Observing Guides provide {{up-to-date}} information for amateur astronomers {{who want to}} know all about what it is they are observing. This is the basis for {{the first part of the}} book. The second part details observing techniques for practical astronomers, working with a range of different instruments. Every amateur astronomer sees "stars" that aren't natural objects steadily slide across the background of the sky. <b>Artificial</b> <b>satellites</b> can be seen on any night, and some are as bright as the planets. But can you identify which satellite or spent launch vehicle casing you are seeing? Do you know how to image it? <b>Artificial</b> <b>Satellites</b> and How to Observe Them describes all of the different satellites that can be observed, including communication, scientific, spy satellites, and of course, the International Space Station. Richard Schmude describes how to recognize them and even how to predict their orbits. The book tells how to observe <b>artificial</b> <b>satellites</b> with the unaided eye, binoculars and with telescopes. Many images of <b>artificial</b> <b>satellites</b> taken from Earth are included. <b>Artificial</b> <b>satellites</b> have changed since the beginning of the twenty-first century. Several additional countries have launched them. And amateur astronomers have utilized digital cameras to image satellites to a resolution of about 1 meter. Readers of astronomy magazines are aware of these developments but will want to get the complete story. Here it is! <b>Artificial</b> <b>Satellites</b> and How to Observe Them is a detailed and up-to-date overview of <b>artificial</b> <b>satellites.</b> Amateur astronomers will even find out how to make useful scientific observations and join the worldwide community of satellite observers, both professional and amateur,  and how to log their work. Here is a volume that should be a welcome addition to any amateur astronomer's personal library. With it in hand, you can begin sampling right away some of the most interesting manmade objects in the sky...|$|R
