5|$|A Volunteer Fire Brigade {{was founded}} in 1844, {{comprising}} five men and <b>a</b> <b>manual</b> engine. The Provincial Gas Light and Coke Company began supplying gas lighting to the village in 1857, and in 1867 a railway station was built three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) west of the village, on the Lincoln-to-Grantham branch of the Great Northern Railway.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{destruction}} of the equipment in the Northgate building several websites hosted there were inaccessibleincluding that of the Labour Party. Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge was also affected; its IT system dealing with admissions and discharges had to be replaced for several days by <b>a</b> <b>manual</b> system.|$|E
5000|$|Standard {{engine was}} aluminium-block {{overhead}} valve [...] ZMZ-24D inline-four producing [...] with one twin-choke carburetor. Only <b>a</b> four-speed <b>manual</b> transmission with floor-mounted shifter was offered (though GAZ did prototype an automatic, <b>a</b> column-shift <b>manual,</b> and <b>a</b> three-speed <b>manual</b> with overdrive).|$|R
50|$|Joseph Joannes Couchet {{became a}} member in 1666 or 1667. His {{instruments}} in existence today are <b>a</b> single <b>manual</b> harpsichord dated 1671 (possibly by Petrus Joannes), given a ravalement and made into <b>a</b> double <b>manual</b> by Pascal Taskin in 1778; <b>a</b> single <b>manual</b> harpsichord dated 1679; and <b>a</b> double <b>manual</b> harpsichord dated 1680 and again given a grand ravalement by Taskin in 1781; a similar unsigned instrument likewise worked on by Taskin {{may also have been}} his.|$|R
50|$|The 840Ci (4.0/4.4l V8) {{models were}} {{equipped}} with a 5-speed automatic transmission or <b>a</b> 6-speed <b>manual</b> transmission.

5|$|Compared to Final Fantasy XI, where party-based {{gameplay}} is forefront at all times, the gameplay in XIV is adjusted so {{that players}} {{can go for}} longer periods without joining a party. There is no auto-attack option, with each action needing <b>a</b> <b>manual</b> input while an enemy is targeted. Each action uses up a stamina bar. Through defeating monsters, crafting items, and completing quests, players accumulate EXP which, when a certain threshold is reached, automatically increments the player's level. The player's level affects attributes such as HP (health/hit points), MP (magic/mana points), {{and the number of}} abilities available to them.|$|E
5|$|Electronic Logging Devices can {{be thought}} of as an {{automated}} electronic log book. An ELD records the same information as <b>a</b> <b>manual</b> paper log book, and requires less input from the driver. The ELD automatically records driving time and location, leaving the driver responsible only for reporting on-duty and off-duty time. In these respects, the ELD is less susceptible to forgery than a paper log book.|$|E
50|$|MATH-MATIC {{was written}} {{beginning}} around 1955 {{by a team}} led by Charles Katz under the direction of Grace Hopper. <b>A</b> preliminary <b>manual</b> was produced in 1957 and <b>a</b> final <b>manual</b> the following year.|$|R
5000|$|Transmission. The X <b>manual</b> {{comes with}} <b>a</b> dual range,five-speed <b>manual</b> transmission. The X auto {{comes with a}} four-speed {{automatic}} transmission.

40|$|The study {{set out to}} {{validate}} the supportive role of screen captures for switching attention. Forty-two participants learned {{how to work with}} Microsoft Excel with <b>a</b> paper <b>manual.</b> There were three types of manuals: <b>a</b> textual <b>manual,</b> <b>a</b> visual <b>manual</b> with full-screen captures, and <b>a</b> visual <b>manual</b> with <b>a</b> mixture of partial- and full-screen captures. The findings show that participants in all conditions looked up from the manual to the screen on about 97 % of the cases in which such a switch was called for rank order analyses showed that users of the visual manuals switched attention significantly more often than did users of the textual manual. No differences were found between conditions on learning effects and training time...|$|R
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), or {{tungsten inert gas}} (TIG) welding, is <b>a</b> <b>manual</b> welding process that uses a nonconsumable tungsten electrode, an inert or semi-inert gas mixture, and a separate filler material. Especially useful for welding thin materials, this method {{is characterized by a}} stable arc and high quality welds, but it requires significant operator skill and can only be accomplished at relatively low speeds.|$|E
5|$|His {{increasing}} interest in mineralogy {{at this time}} is also apparent from the titles of two books he authored between 1803 and 1809. The first was a two volume work that appeared in 1804 entitled A Practical Essay on the Analysis of Minerals, which was reissued in 1808 as <b>A</b> <b>Manual</b> of Analytical Mineralogy. In 1809 he published Analysis of a Course of Lectures on Mineralogy. Beginning in 1808, while at the Surrey Institution, Accum also published, {{a series of articles}} on the chemical properties and composition of mineral water in Alexander Tilloch's Philosophical Journal.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, a {{new process}} based on GTAW was developed, called plasma arc welding. It affords greater control and {{improves}} weld quality {{by using a}} nozzle to focus the electric arc, but is largely limited to automated systems, whereas GTAW remains primarily <b>a</b> <b>manual,</b> hand-held method. Development within the GTAW process has continued as well, and today a number of variations exist. Among the most popular are the pulsed-current, manual programmed, hot-wire, dabber, and increased penetration GTAW methods.|$|E

5000|$|Upon its release, IBM 1401, <b>A</b> User's <b>Manual</b> {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Pitchfork's Mark Richardson {{gave it a}} 6.9 saying that the record [...] "begins beautifully" [...] and has a [...] "powerful finish", [...] "but the long sag in the middle makes IBM 1401 - <b>A</b> User's <b>Manual</b> <b>a</b> bit harder to recommend overall." ...|$|R
5000|$|Transmission {{options include}} <b>a</b> 6-speed <b>manual</b> and 6-speed {{automatic}} for the American market, with the European market receiving <b>a</b> 5-speed <b>manual</b> for the 1.25L Petrol engine, <b>a</b> 6-speed <b>manual</b> for the 1.4L Petrol, 1.1L and 1.4L Diesels and a 4-speed automatic for the 1.4L petrol [...] "2" [...] spec model in 5-door configuration. Intelligent stop & go {{is an option}} on almost all available trim and engine levels.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to altered dates, electrotypes of the 1804 dollar were created, {{both for the}} purposes of study and fraud. One such coin {{in the collection of the}} San Francisco Mint was described by them as genuine from 1887 to 1927. Electrotypes were also created by Mint employees, and one was used as the basis for the pantograph reproductions which appeared in Eckfeldt and DuBois' 1842 <b>A</b> <b>Manual</b> of Gold and Silver Coins of All Nations.|$|E
5|$|In the Crystal City, Virginia {{headquarters}} of the software company Eurisko, founder Brad Wilczek {{and chief executive officer}} Benjamin Drake argue about downsizing measures. After Wilczek leaves, Drake writes a memo proposing to shut down the Central Operating System, a computer which runs the Eurisko Building. Seeing this through a surveillance camera, the COS sets up a trap and lures Drake into a bathroom, locking the door behind him. Drake tries to use his keycard to open it, but it rejects the card. When he inserts <b>a</b> <b>manual</b> override key, he is fatally electrocuted.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the accident, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) issued an Airworthiness Directive ordering all DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft to be fitted with <b>a</b> <b>manual</b> device which could prevent the inadvertent reversal of the propeller blades. United Airlines also stated they had begun installing reverse thrust indicator lights in the cockpits of their DC-6 aircraft, which would warn pilots when a propeller had reversed.|$|E
5000|$|Like the Fiat Idea, the Musa offers <b>an</b> {{electrohydraulic}} <b>manual</b> transmission, <b>an</b> automated <b>manual</b> transmission {{marketed as}} Dolce Far Niente (D.F.N.) [...] - [...] for all engines except the 8-valve {{version of the}} 1.4 FIRE.|$|R
