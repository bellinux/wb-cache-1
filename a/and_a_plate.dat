5|$|Generally, no {{separate}} food offerings {{are cooked}} for the goddess Vimala. The goddess is described {{to survive on}} the remnants (Ucchishta) of Jagannath's meals. The vegetarian food offerings to Jagannath are offered to Vimala, after which they are sanctified as Mahaprasad (see also prasad). The Mahaprasad consists of dried rice mixed with grated coconut, cheese, curd and butter. The Shankaracharya, head of the Govardhana matha, receives a pot of the mahaprasad <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> of khichdi that is offered to the goddess, the presiding goddess (Adya-shakti) of the matha {{as well as of}} the temple.|$|E
5|$|Millipede bodies may be {{flattened}} or cylindrical, and {{are composed}} of numerous metemeric segments, each with an exoskeleton consisting of five chitinous plates: a single plate above (the tergite), one at each side (pleurites), <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> on the underside (sternite) where the legs attach. In many millipedes, these plates are fused to varying degrees, sometimes forming a single cylindrical ring. The plates are typically hard, being impregnated with calcium salts. Because they lack a waxy cuticle, millipedes are susceptible to water loss and must {{spend most of their}} time in moist or humid environments.|$|E
25|$|A {{thermionic}} diode is a thermionic-valve device (also {{known as}} a vacuum tube, tube, or valve), consisting of a sealed evacuated glass envelope containing two electrodes: a cathode heated by a filament, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> (anode). Early examples were fairly similar in appearance to incandescent light bulbs.|$|E

25|$|Choosing {{the right}} heat {{exchanger}} (HX) requires {{some knowledge of}} the different heat exchanger types, {{as well as the}} environment where the unit must operate. Typically in the manufacturing industry, several differing types of heat exchangers are used for just one process or system to derive the final product. For example, a kettle HX for pre-heating, a double pipe HX for the ‘carrier’ fluid <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> and frame HX for final cooling. With sufficient knowledge of heat exchanger types and operating requirements, an appropriate selection can be made to optimise the process.|$|E

25|$|Pigot {{engaged the}} vessels for an hour, and after Matilda had grounded, took his crew in her boats and {{captured}} Golden Grove. The British then captured {{the other two}} vessels. Lastly, Pigot fired {{on a group of}} 100 militia and a field gun, dispersing them. The British had two men killed, and 14 wounded, including Pigot, who had received two bullet wounds to his head and one to a leg. Spanish casualties were reportedly 25 men killed (including five Americans) and 22 men wounded. A crowd of Americans on the Georgia side of the river watched the entire battle. Pigot was unable to extricate himself and his prizes from the river until 21 July, but during the entire period he remained in command except when he was getting his wounds dressed. For his efforts Pigot received a promotion to commander, and the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund awarded him a medal <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> worth £50.|$|E

500|$|The Hamilcar was {{constructed}} primarily from wood, mainly birch and spruce, with fabric-covered plywood forming the skin, and {{high grade steel}} reinforcement beams in critical areas. It had a wingspan of , a length of [...] and a height of [...] {{to the top of}} the fin with the tail down. It weighed [...] when empty, and could transport a military load of [...] to give a total weight of [...] The whole aircraft was broken down into smaller sections for transport. It was so large and heavy that it required the largest and most powerful aircraft to pull it off the airfield and subsequently tow it; four-engined bombers were used, most frequently the Handley Page Halifax. Both wing and cockpit were set above the fuselage to provide the greatest amount of room for the cargo compartment, and to ensure that they did not interfere with the loading of vehicles; the compartment measured approximately , [...] inches wide and between [...] and [...] inches in height. The nose of the glider was hinged and opened to the side for ease of loading vehicles and cargo, and the crew of two pilots were seated in tandem in a cockpit on the top of the fuselage, which was accessed via an internal ladder and was fifteen feet above ground; they were eventually protected by a bullet-proof windscreen <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> of armour behind the second pilot. An intercom was also added to provide communication between the pilots and the personnel below them. An initial design feature, which was eventually removed prior to full-scale production, was the installation of an under-fuselage hatch which would allow the prone firing of a Bren light machine gun as the glider approached the landing zone.|$|E

2500|$|A6M5c, Model 52丙 (Hei, c) – Armament change: One 13.2mm (.51in) Type 3 {{machine gun}} was added in each wing {{outboard}} of the cannon, and the 7.7mm {{gun on the}} left side of the cowl was deleted. [...] Four racks for rockets or small bombs were installed outboard of the 13mm gun in each wing. [...] Engine change: Some sources state that the hei had a Sakae 31 engine [...] In addition, a 55mm thick piece of armored glass was installed at the headrest <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>plate</b> of armor was installed behind the seat. [...] The mounting of the central 300L drop tank changed to a four-post design. [...] Wing skin was thickened further. The first of this variant was completed in September 1944.

And, tea...the changing face of the area (especially the immigrants) is a constant source of fear to her, but then she doesn't go out much.
