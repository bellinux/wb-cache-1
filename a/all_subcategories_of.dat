40|$|Background Patients with {{acromioclavicular joint}} (ACJ) and sternoclavicular joint (SCJ) {{injuries}} and with clavicle fractures are typically {{younger and more}} active than those with other shoulder pathologies. We developed the Nottingham Clavicle Score (NCS) specifically for this group of patients to improve sensitivity for assessing the outcomes of treatment of these conditions compared with the more commonly used Constant Score (CS) and Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS). Materials and methods This was a cohort study in which the preoperative and 6 -month postoperative NCS evaluations of outcome in 90 patients were compared with the CS, OSS, Imatani Score (IS), and the EQ- 5 D scores. Reliability was assessed using the Cronbach α. Reproducibility of the NCS was assessed using the test/retest method. Effect sizes were calculated for each score to assess sensitivity to change. Validity was examined by correlations between the NCS and the CS, OSS, IS, and EQ- 5 D scores obtained preoperatively and postoperatively. Results Significant correlations were demonstrated preoperatively with the OSS (P[*]=[*]. 025) and <b>all</b> <b>subcategories</b> <b>of</b> the EQ- 5 D (P[*]<[*]. 05) and postoperatively with the OSS (P[*]<[*]. 001), CS (P[*]=[*]. 008), IS (P[*]<[*]. 001), and <b>all</b> <b>subcategories</b> <b>of</b> EQ- 5 D (P[*]<[*]. 02).

40|$|Childhood {{adversity}} {{plays an}} important role for development of major depressive disorder (MDD). There are differences in subcortical brain structures between patients with MDD and healthy controls, but the specific impact of childhood adversity on such structures in MDD remains unclear. Thus, aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether childhood adversity is associated with subcortical volumes and how it interacts with a diagnosis of MDD and sex. Within the ENIGMA-MDD network, nine university partner sites, which assessed childhood adversity and magnetic resonance imaging in patients with MDD and controls, took part in the current joint mega-analysis. In this largest effort world-wide to identify subcortical brain structure differences related to childhood adversity, 3036 participants were analyzed for subcortical brain volumes using FreeSurfer. A significant interaction was evident between childhood adversity, MDD diagnosis, sex, and region. Increased exposure to childhood adversity was associated with smaller caudate volumes in females independent of MDD. <b>All</b> <b>subcategories</b> <b>of</b> childhood adversity were negatively associated with caudate volumes in females - in particular emotional neglect and physical neglect (independently from age, ICV, imaging site and MDD diagnosis). There was no interaction effect between childhood adversity and MDD diagnosis on subcortical brain volumes. Childhood adversity is one of the contributors to brain structural abnormalities. It is associated with subcortical brain abnormalities that are relevant to psychiatric disorders such as depression. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

SUBJECTS [...] 27, 884 seamen, both fishermen and sailors from the merchant fleet, {{who had been}} members of a pension fund from 1958 to 1986. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Cause of death (ICD seventh revision), standardised mortality ratio. RESULTS [...] Most standardised mortality ratios were greater than 1, being 1. 26 for all causes and 1. 83 for all external causes. There was no healthy worker effect. The excess of deaths from all external causes included <b>all</b> <b>subcategories</b> <b>of</b> death from accidents, poisonings, and violence and not just accidents at sea (water transport accidents, ICD codes E 850 -E 858). A significant trend was found for length of employment and mortality from all accidents at sea, drowning at sea, accidental poisoning, other accidents, and accidental drowning; correlation coefficients for all causes, all accidents, suicide, and injuries undetermined whether accidentally or purposely inflicted were 0. 7 - 0. 8. Compared with seamen who started work during 1968 - 77, those who started work in 1978 or later had higher mortality from all causes, road traffic accidents, poisoning, other accidents, homicide, and injuries unknown whether accidentally or purposely inflicted, but not from all accidents at sea and accidental drowning.

Survival in lung cancer was studied in 2001 e 2004 in England, Norway and Sweden. Methods Nationwide cancer registries in England, Norway and Sweden were used to identify 250 828 patients with lung cancer from England, 18 386 from Norway and 24 886 from Sweden diagnosed between 1996 and 2004, after exclusion of patients registered through death certificate only or with missing, zero or negative survival times. 5 -Year relative survival was calculated by application of the period approach. The excess mortality between the countries was compared using a Poisson regression model. Results In <b>all</b> <b>subcategories</b> <b>of</b> age, sex and follow-up period, the 5 -year survival was lower in England than in Norway and Sweden. The age-standardised survival estimates were 6. 5 %, 9. 3 % and 11. 3 % for men and 8. 4 %, 13. 5 % and 15. 9 % {{for women in the}} respective countries in 2001 e 2004. The difference in excess risk of dying between the countries was predominantly confined to the first year of follow-up. The relative excess risk ratio during the first 3 months of follow-up comparing England with Norway 2001 e 2004 varied between 1. 23 and 1. 46, depending on sex and age, and between 1. 56 and 1. 91 comparing England with Sweden.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the mechanism of}} injury and the finding of traumatic axonal injury (TAI) and TAI grades on clinical MRI in moderate and severe TBI. Methods: A total of 390 consecutive patients, age 7 - 69 years, with moderate or severe TBI admitted to St. Olavs University Hospital (Trondheim, Norway) during a 9 -year period were prospectively included in a database. In this study 217 of the patients with known mechanism of injury and MRI performed within 35 days post injury (median 8, IQR 4 - 17) were included. The mechanism of injury was registered as; road traffic accident (RTA), alpine, fall, violence and other. The MRI protocol consisted of; T 2 * weighted gradient echo (GRE), fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequences. TAI lesions were evaluated blinded and categorized into three grades based on location: white matter of the hemispheres (grade 1), corpus callosum (grade 2) and brain stem (grade 3). Results: Patients injured in RTAs and any type of fall had TAI lesions in 81 % and 61 % of the cases respectively. There {{was a significant difference}} in TAI grades between the RTA subcategories (including the alpine category) (p= 0. 008) : All pedestrians had TAI lesions and the highest mean TAI grade of 2. 27 (95 % CI 1. 74 – 2. 80), followed by the alpine accidents with TAI in 90 % and mean TAI grade of 2. 10 (CI 1. 39 – 2. 81) and patients who were inside a car with TAI in 89 % and mean TAI grade of 1. 97 (CI 1. 72 – 2. 21). There was also {{a significant difference between the}} TAI grades in the fall subcategories (p= 0. 015) : Patients with falls from > own height had TAI in 76 % of the cases with mean TAI grade of 1. 46 (CI 1. 09 – 1. 83), followed by fall in stairs with TAI in 60 % and mean TAI grade of 1. 00 (CI 0. 50 – 1. 50). Patients with low-energy injuries such as falls from ≤ own height had TAI lesions in 37. 5 % of the cases with mean TAI grade of 0. 44 (CI 0. 10 – 0. 77). Conclusion: Pedestrians had the highest percentage of TAI and TAI grade of <b>all</b> <b>subcategories</b> <b>of</b> injury followed by alpine accidents.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on some {{problems}} concerning the typology and taxonomy of animal proverbs. The term 'animal proverbs' denotes proverbs containing names of zoological creatures used in metaphorical or literal meaning. The article begins with a theoretical approach to the clarity/vagueness (discreteness/continuativity) of proverb typology and the phenomenon of "type thickets" {{on the basis of}} W. Anderson's law of folkloric feedback. Then follows a general discussion on animal proverbs: presenting source material, pointing out the main problems that have been caught the interest of paremiologists so far, such as 1) the frequency of animals in proverbs and 2) the repertoire structure of animal proverbs. Animal proverbs as a research subject has been divided in the following semantical-rhetorical categories: A. Proverbs concerning animal identity. B. Proverbs concerning the relationship between people and animals (usually in metaphorical meaning). C. Proverbs concerning the relationships between (metaphorical, as a rule) animals. D. Proverbs concerning the relation of animals (either metaphorical or non-metaphorical) towards non-zoological nature and dimensions. The article provides a brief characterisation of stereotypes belonging to the latter three categories under discussion. Follows a more detailed overview of material belonging to category A, i. e. proverbs concerning the problem of specific identity of animals, or to be more exact, two subcategories determined by the topics and statements of the literal level of meaning: 1) The animal retains its specific identity ~ it will not ~ cannot be turned into another animal; 2) Son [...] parent relationship, transmitting of special characteristics from parents to their offspring. A few examples of groups extracted from subcategory 1 :Quasi-autologies:'Animal X is X ~ remains an X'All representatives of species X are identical, similar, alike, there is no significant difference between themAnimal X behaves as animal X ~ persists in its behaviour ~ its nature ~ its character will not change Animal retains the somatic features of its species (incl. fur, colour) ~ these cannot be eliminated ~ changed Animal X retains its characteristic way of moving, motor responses, etc. Animal X retains its characteristic way of making sounds ~ has to make sounds ~ [...] .

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{collocation}} errors among Chinese learners of English. The main purposes are: 1) {{to describe and}} contrast the collocations of Chinese (Mandarin) and English; 2) to explain the occurrence of the major types of errors of English collocations committed by the Chinese learners of English; 3) to identify the areas of difficulty including the MT interference and hierarchy of difficulty encountered by the Chinese learners {{in the use of}} English collocations using CA and EA. To achieve these goals, both English and Chinese collocations are described and compared, which has been received little attention in the past. The data was collected from one writing task administered during classroom hours. The learner corpus consisted of 117 pieces of written texts. In the data analysis, received categories about linguistic errors were critically scrutinized. Wordsmith Tool with concordance lines of BNC and LC was employed to highlight selected KWIC. Oxford Advanced Learner Dictionary was also used to identify and analyze errors. SPSS and MicroFinder were employed to count the numbers and percentages of errors in the EA. CA involves two methods - theoretical CA and applied CA, the latter of which is also Error Analysis (EA). The former is aimed at predicting potential learning difficulties by analyzing the differences between the structures of MT and TL. The latter is aimed at identifying and explaining actual errors committed by the students. In fact, both approaches are useful in the explanation of errors in a TL. This study gave {{a detailed description of the}} procedure of EA in concurrence with the CA method. This study identified seven categories of English collocation errors. They were errors on noun + noun / prepositional phrase collocation, noun + verb / phrasal verb iii collocation, verb / phrasal verb + noun collocation, adjective + noun collocation, verb + adverb collocation, adverb + adjective + noun collocation, and a / numeral + quantifying noun + of + head noun collocation. Errors on English subject-predicate structures were found to be the most common among <b>all</b> <b>subcategories</b> <b>of</b> English collocations among Chinese learners of English, followed by English verb + noun collocation errors, and adverb + verb and adverb + adjective + noun collocation errors were the least common. English attributive modifier + head noun collocations are less common than verb + noun collocation errors. Intralingual source of errors found in the context such as ignorance of restrictive collocation rules of English was found to be most responsible for English collocation errors committed by Chinese learners of English. From lexical and grammatical levels of collocations, violation of English lexical collocations is found more than that of grammatical collocations. They are grammatically and semantically plausible but inappropriate use in the context. In terms of syntax, English collocation errors were traced back to interference from the MT. Chinese compounds, Chinese non-phrasal verbs and non-inflectional morphology in part-of-speech were structurally different from English and thus interfered with the learning of English collocations among Chinese learners of English. Areas of difficulty in the learning of English collocations and the hierarchy of difficulty identified from CA were found to keep agreement with those found from EA. Hence, this verifies that Contrastive Analysis (CA) is a useful tool to predict potential problems facing learners. Intralingual errors and errors due to circumlocution (using more words than necessary) identified from EA indicate that EA is a complement to CA in identifying all possible learner errors. Therefore, blending of CA into EA to construct an iv integrated theory and approach is significant in the identification, explanation and identification of TL errors. Pedagogically, the finding implies that CA-based methodology will enable students to locate and focus on the difficulties in learning English vocabulary to enhance teaching effectiveness. EA can be helpful in identifying all possible errors and thus overcoming them. Learning strategies such as collocation strategy is important for learners in the learning of English vocabulary...|$|E

40|$|This {{histological}} {{study is}} based on a macroscopical study of post-mortem hip joints (Byers, Contepomi, and Farkas, 1970) in which two categories of articular cartilage alterations, in addition to osteophytes, were described. One category consisted of 'limited' alterations which occurred frequently, had several subcategories, and rarely led to joint deformity. The other consisted of progressive alterations which caused bone exposure and joint deformity. Histological sections from both groups, including <b>all</b> the <b>subcategories</b> <b>of</b> the first, were studied. Initially the mechanisms that destroy cartilage were determined, and then their prevalence was assessed. Six mechanisms were found, all occurring in the group of limited alterations with varying prevalence and in varying combinations. Only one, fibrillation, occurred in the progressive group...|$|R

Kennison [5], Herrlich [2], Herrlich and Strecker [4], Kannan [6 - 8].) In this paper {{we are concerned}} with the following question and its analogues: Let ~ [...] be the category of all topological spaces with continuous maps as morphisms. Can a proper <b>subcategory</b> <b>of</b> oj- be both reflexive and co-reflexive in 9 -? The answer turns out to be in the negative. We show further that almost <b>all</b> nice <b>subcategories</b> <b>of</b> 3 " have the property that hey do not have any proper eflexive cum coreflexive <b>subcategory.</b> Anyhow, examples <b>of</b> <b>subcategories</b> <b>of</b> Y are given which have proper reflexive cum coreflexive subcategories on their own right. The validity of the analogous theorem is discussed in some supercategories of ~ [...] also. An interesting corollary to the proof of Theorem 1 states that a productive intersective divisible topological property (such as e. g., compactness) must fail to be additive...|$|R
40|$|Through a {{critical}} rereading of Marxist class theory, a reexamination {{of the border}} line between the working and middle classes is undertaken, focusing on the class identity of middle classes {{with respect to the}} question of class place and class position. In this context we summarize the arguments in Nicos Poulantzas's approach to the subject (mainly his theory of ""pertinent effects"", according to which <b>all</b> basic <b>subcategories</b> <b>of</b> the middle classes are affiliated with the self-same petty bourgeoisie), submitting these arguments to criticism and supporting a more accurate view of middle-class subcollectivities, not as parts of the same class but as different classes: the middle bourgeoisie, the traditional petty bourgeoisie, and the new petty bourgeoisie. © 2011 Association for Economic and Social Analysis...|$|R

In {{the main}} theorem {{of this article}} the author proves {{that there is a}} {{bijection}} between the set <b>of</b> <b>all</b> colocalizing <b>subcategories</b> <b>of</b> D(R) and the set of all subsets of Spec(R). This bijection is given by sending a colocalizing subcategory C to the subset {p ∈ Spec(R) | k(p) ∈ C} and by sending a subset B of Spec(R) to the colocalizing subcategory cogenerated by the objects k(p), p ∈ B. An analogous statement was proven by the author in [Topology 31 (1992), no. 3, 519 – 532; MR 1174255 (93 h: 18018) ] for the localizing subcategories. A bijection between localizing and colocalizing subcategories is also given by sending a localizing subcategory to its right orthogonal, which is a colocalizing category, and by sending...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLet k be a {{field and}} H a Hopf algebra over k with a {{bijective}} antipode. Suppose that H acts on an associative (left noetherian) k-algebra R such that R is an H-module algebra. We consider the categories <b>of</b> <b>all</b> H-modules, the <b>subcategory</b> <b>of</b> {{those which are}} H-locally finite, and the <b>subcategories</b> <b>of</b> each which are also R-modules in a compatible way. These categories are all abelian with enough injectives and we derive spectral sequences relating Ext∗(−,−) in them. Now let (−) H denote taking H-invariants and set S=RH. We define a functor LS(R,−) from ModS to ModR(#H) that has good behavior with respect to injective objects. We also show that the functor (−) H carries some injectives to injectives. When R is commutative, H is cocommutative, and k is projective {{in the category of}} finite-dimensional H-modules, we obtain more precise results, comparing, for example, the Picard groups PicR(R,H) and Pic(S) ...|$|R
