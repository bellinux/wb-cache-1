40|$|Experimental results {{obtained}} with nine model propellers in an cavitation tank have been analyzed {{in order to}} develop tools for the design of the main parameters of surface-piercing propellers and to reveal the influence of spindle moments and secondary forces in the propeller plane on the propeller performance. General conclusion have been drawn for the design of partially submerged propellers: It is expected that a slight curvature increase improves the propeller efficiency. Large hub ratios should be omitted, ratios of about 14 % as in rolla-propellers are desirable. The influence of declivity on the spindle moments has been quantified submersion ratios of 40 - 50 % are proposed. For increased submersion during the starting period special measures are required, as realized e. g. in <b>articulated</b> <b>shafts.</b> (WEN) Available from TIB Hannover: RN 6733 (1995, 12) +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekSIGLEBundesministerium fuer Bildung, Wissenschaft, Forschung und Technologie, Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|E
50|$|The {{constant}} velocity joint used to make modern <b>articulated</b> drive <b>shafts</b> was unheard of as yet and even the simpler Hooke-type universal joint wasn't yet in common use. Thornycroft's usual practice for prop shafts {{at the time was}} to use a flexible leather disk joint. To save weight, the axle casings were cast in aluminium.|$|R
50|$|The engine (with {{electric}} starter) {{is connected}} to the hydraulic transmission by a torsionally flexible clutch and a short <b>articulated</b> drive <b>shaft.</b> The reversing gear is directly connected to the hydraulic transmission and drives the jack shaft. The torque is transmitted by side rods to the wheels. A belt drive from the engine drives the radiator fan, the air compressor and the alternator.|$|R
50|$|Four {{wheel drive}} for heavy {{vehicles}} {{in this period}} was difficult and the Hathi used a complex arrangement of bevel gears to transmit drive through the steering joints of the front axle. Rather than the common system of <b>articulated</b> drive <b>shafts</b> to the front hubs (the shaft either inside an axle casing or external), fixed shafts were used. Shafts inside the axle casing carried power {{to the ends of}} the axle, then a bevel gear drove a short vertical shaft running through the steering kingpin. A further bevel on the outer part of the hub carrier (the part moving with the steering) drove the hub itself.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} examine Kuo Pao Kun's modern {{reiteration}} of the Zheng He theme in his 1995 Singaporean play titled Descendants of the Eunuch Admiral 郑和的后代. The memory of Zheng He and his legacy rooted in an anomalous series of sea expeditions makes him unique in Chinese history and speaks to contemporary issues of multiculturalism, ethnic hybridity, and the geopolitics of migration and diaspora. Kuo reappropriates the Zheng He theme to re-present the eunuch admiral as an ancient {{paradigm of the}} modern multicultural man in an increasingly transnational world. Scholars have noted the way Kuo uses storytelling to prompt people in Singapore to show a greater willingness to live together as a multiethnic, multicultural, and multilingual nation. However, I argue that the play's text reveals more somber and personal undercurrents, where Kuo draws upon an intimate understanding of the classical Chinese Zheng He story to record shrewd observations and <b>articulate</b> concealed <b>shafts</b> of criticism about Singapore's bureaucracy, intermingled with philosophical reflections addressing contemporary Sinophone lived reality...|$|R
40|$|Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery (TEM) is a {{minimally}} invasive oncological resection procedure that utilises a natural orifice approach {{rather than the}} traditional abdominal or open approach. However, TEM has a significant recurrence rate due to incomplete excisions, which can possibly {{be attributed to the}} absence of intraoperative image guidance. The use of real-time histological data could allow the surgeons to assess the surgical margins intraoperatively and adjust the procedure accordingly. This paper presents the integration of endomicroscopy and ultrasound imaging through a robotically actuated instrument. Endomicroscopy can provide high resolution images at a surface level while ultrasound provides depth resolved information at a macroscopic level. Endomicroscopy scanning is achieved with a novel scanning approach featuring a passive force adaptive mechanism. The instrument is manipulated across the surgical workspace through an <b>articulated</b> flexible <b>shaft.</b> This results in the ability to perform large area mosaics coupled with ultrasound scanning. In addition, the use of endoscopic tracking is demonstrated, allowing three-dimensional reconstruction of the ultrasound data displayed onto the endoscopic view. An ex vivo study on porcine colon tissue has been performed, demonstrating the clinical applicability of the instrument...|$|R
