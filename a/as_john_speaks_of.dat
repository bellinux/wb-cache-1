5000|$|Augustine of Hippo's {{reason for}} {{interpreting}} angels {{of the churches}} as the prelates {{of the church is}} that St. <b>John</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> them <b>as</b> falling from their first charity, which is not true of the angels.

60|$|That {{the words}} {{comprehend}} Christ is most evident.

Whenever, therefore, respecting the Godhead itself, containing both deity and dominion, the term God is distinctively used, it {{is applied to the}} Father, and Lord to the Son.|$|R

They try {{to persuade him to}} stay. Jack, now a chronic drunk, also appears and offers to help. Susanna allows him to stay, despite the distaste of Rafe and Hester. <b>John</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> his impotence <b>as</b> a doctor, believing that his inability to help Susanna's father is divine punishment. He tells Susanna that he now understands that she believed her father to be suffering from gonorrhea, and that the treatment she was preparing was intended for him. But her father's disease is more serious than that, and John has no cure. News arrives that Susanna's father needs to be carried into the garden in a special chair. Susanna reflects that her father was unfaithful to her mother, but everyone felt 'warm' {{when he was in the}} house. Rafe, Jack and Hester all help to carry him into the garden.|$|R

25|$|In Egypt, {{the first}} home of monasticism, the {{jurisdiction}} of the abbot, or archimandrite, was but loosely defined. Sometimes he ruled over only one community, sometimes over several, each of which had its own abbot <b>as</b> well. Saint <b>John</b> Cassian <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> an abbot of the Thebaid who had 500 monks under him. By the Rule of St Benedict, which, until the Cluniac reforms, was the norm in the West, the abbot has jurisdiction over only one community. The rule, as was inevitable, was subject to frequent violations; {{but it was not until}} the foundation of the Cluniac Order that the idea of a supreme abbot, exercising jurisdiction over all the houses of an order, was definitely recognized.|$|R
5000|$|Finally, her {{abilities}} as regent are debatable. <b>John</b> Julius Norwich <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> her [...] "total unfitness to govern," [...] but {{the success of}} Stephen during his short tenure is undeniable and she is primarily blamed for her refusal to see the disaffection her relatives caused the local nobility. Jacqueline Alio, her biographer, gives Margaret more credit for competent rule in trying circumstances.|$|R

5000|$|By 879, a bishopric of Drougoubiteia (Δρουγουβιτεία), suffragan to the Metropolis of Thessalonica, {{had been}} established. Nicolas Oikonomides has {{suggested}} that {{at about the same}} time, the tribe was placed under a Byzantine military governor with the title of strategos. In the late 10th and 11th centuries, Drougoubiteia is attested as being united with the themes of Thessalonica and Strymon into a single province. In the early 10th century, <b>John</b> Kaminiates <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> the Drougoubitai as living around Veroia, while in the 13th century, Demetrios Chomatenos mentions them as [...] "ruling" [...] all the land from Veroia up to Skopje.|$|R
5000|$|When St. <b>John</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> a voice [...] "as {{if it were}} a trumpet", Duvet {{depicts a}} trumpet {{blasting}} into the saint's ear. The urgency and confidence of Duvet's vision triumph over his technical limitations. As well as recalling the medieval past, Duvet's work also looks forward to the more agitated style of the art produced during the French Wars of Religion later in the sixteenth century. Duvet's work was produced, like that of Rosso and Pontormo in the Florence of the 1520s, in an urban atmosphere of religious excitement, since the town of Langres was in the grip of an enthusiastic and emotional Catholic revival at the time. Duvet shares with those Florentine artists the style of distorted and crowded figures and borrowings from Dürer, though his use of Gothic elements is more pronounced. Some scholars have also compared Duvet's art to that of William Blake (1757-1827). Both were visionary artists with the [...] "supreme confidence of the mystic"; both were in some ways technically incompetent. They were also both inspired by medieval artists and by engravers of the High Renaissance and drew on Mannerist forms. Blake may have known of the earlier artist, since certain echoes of Duvet's work in Blake's seem more than coincidental.|$|R
