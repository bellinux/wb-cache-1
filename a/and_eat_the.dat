5|$|The entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae {{attacks and}} kills crickets {{and has been}} used as the basis of control in pest populations. The insects are also {{affected}} by the cricket paralysis virus, which has caused high levels of fatalities in cricket-rearing facilities. Other fatal diseases that have been identified in mass-rearing establishments include Rickettsia and three further viruses. The diseases may spread more rapidly if the crickets become cannibalistic <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> corpses.|$|E
5|$|In P. fimbriata from Queensland and in {{some other}} species, {{contests}} between males usually last only 5 to 10seconds, and only their legs make contact. Contests between Portia females are usually long and violent, and in P. fimbriata from Queensland these often including grappling that sometimes breaks a leg. A victor may evict a loser, and then eat the loser's eggs and take over the loser's web. Unlike in some other Portia species, victorious females of P. fimbriata from Queensland do not kill <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> losers.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} is very {{efficient}} at eating its prey; {{not only is}} it able to splinter <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> largest ungulate bones, it is also able to digest them completely. Spotted hyenas can digest all organic components in bones, not just the marrow. Any inorganic material is excreted with the faeces, which consist almost entirely of a white powder with few hairs. They react to alighting vultures more readily than other African carnivores, {{and are more likely to}} stay in the vicinity of lion kills or human settlements.|$|E

5|$|Gilbertian mimicry {{occurs in}} the genus Passiflora. The leaves of this plant contain toxins that deter herbivorous animals. However, some Heliconius {{butterfly}} larvae have evolved enzymes that break down these toxins, allowing them to specialize on this genus. This has created further selection pressure on the host plants, which have evolved stipules that mimic mature Heliconius eggs near the point of hatching. These butterflies tend to avoid laying eggs near existing ones, which helps avoid exploitative intraspecific competition between caterpillars — those that lay on vacant leaves provide their offspring with a greater chance of survival. Most Heliconius larvae are cannibalistic, meaning that on leaves older eggs hatch first <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> new arrivals. Thus, it seems that such plants have evolved egg dummies under selection pressure from these grazing herbivore enemies. In addition, the decoy eggs are also nectaries, attracting predators of the caterpillars such as ants and wasps as a further defence.|$|E
5|$|In Adventure, the player's goal is {{to recover}} the Enchanted Chalice that an evil magician has stolen and hidden in the kingdom {{and return it to}} the Golden Castle. The kingdom {{includes}} two other castles (White and Black) and various obstacles and mazes within them. Further, the kingdom is guarded by three dragons: Yorgle (yellow dragon), Grundle (green dragon), and Rhindle (red dragon who moves much faster than the other two), that protect various items in the game and will try to chase <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> player's avatar. There is also a bat that can roam across the kingdom freely, carrying a single item (which can include the player's avatar or a dragon) around; the bat was to be named Knubberrub but the name did not make it into the manual. The bat has two states, agitated and non-agitated; when in the agitated state, the bat will either pick up or swap what it currently carries with an object in the present room, eventually returning to the non-agitated state where it will not pick up an object. The bat continues to fly around even if not present on the player's current screen and may continue moving or swapping around objects.|$|E
5|$|Tarrare crossed Prussian lines {{under cover}} of darkness, {{disguised}} as a German peasant. Unable to speak German, he soon {{attracted the attention of}} local residents, who alerted the Prussian authorities, and he was captured outside Landau. A strip search found nothing suspicious on his person, and despite being whipped by Prussian soldiers, he refused to betray his mission. Brought before the local Prussian commander, General Zoegli, he again refused to talk and was imprisoned. After 24 hours of captivity, Tarrare relented and explained the scheme to his captors. He was chained to a latrine, and eventually, 30 hours after being swallowed, the wooden box emerged. Zoegli was furious when the documents, which Tarrare had said contained vital intelligence, transpired only to be deBeauharnais's dummy message, and Tarrare was taken to a gallows and the noose placed around his neck. (Some sources state that Zoegli never retrieved the box, as Tarrare had {{the presence of mind to}} recover <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> stool containing it before it could be seized by the Prussians.) At the last minute, Zoegli relented, and Tarrare was taken down from the scaffold, given a severe beating, and released near the French lines.|$|E

5|$|When meeting {{another of}} the same species, P. fimbriata does not use cryptic {{stalking}} but displays by moving quickly and smoothly. In P. fimbriata from Queensland, contests between males usually are very brief and do no damage. Contests between Portia females are usually long and violent, and the victor may evict a loser and then eat the loser's eggs – but victorious females of P. fimbriata from Queensland do not kill <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> losing female. If a P. fimbriata male from Queensland displays to a female, she may run away or she may charge at him. If the pair reach agreement after this, they will copulate if she is mature, and if she is sub-adult he will cohabit in her nest until she finishes moulting, and then they copulate. P. fimbriata typically copulates much quicker than other jumping spiders. Unlike in other Portia species, females of P. fimbriata do not eat their mates during courting, nor during or after copulation.|$|E

25|$|Males are dimorphic in song type: songs A and B {{are quite}} distinct. Also, males with song A have shorter bills than B males. This {{is also a}} clear difference. With these beaks males are able to feed {{differently}} on their favourite cactus, the prickly pear Opuntia. Those with long beaks are able to punch holes in the cactus fruit <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> fleshy aril pulp which surrounds the seeds, whereas those with shorter beaks tear apart the cactus base <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> pulp and any insect larvae and pupae (both groups eat flowers and buds). This dimorphism clearly maximises their feeding opportunities during the non-breeding season when food is scarce.|$|E

25|$|The {{family also}} {{contains}} the well studied kleptoparasitic {{species of the}} subfamily Argyrodinae (including Argyrodes, Faiditus, and Neospintharus) which often have triangular bodies. These spiders live in the webs of larger spiders and pilfer small prey caught by their host's web, eat prey killed by the host spider, and may consume silk from the host web, as well as attack <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> host itself.|$|E
25|$|Wasps, ants, and bees (order Hymenoptera) are not {{necessarily}} necrophagous. While some feed on the body, some are also predatory, <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> insects feeding on the body. Bees and wasps have been seen feeding on the body during the early stages. This may cause problems for murder cases in which larval flies are used to estimate the post mortem interval since eggs and larvae on the body may have been consumed prior to the arrival on scene of investigators.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{surprising}} hunting behaviour occurs among the araneophagous Salticidae, and it varies greatly in method. Many of the spider-hunting species quite commonly will attack other spiders, whether fellow salticids or not, {{in the same way}} as any other prey, but some kinds resort to web invasion; nonspecialists such as Phidippus audax sometimes attack prey ensnared in webs, basically in acts of kleptoparasitism — sometimes they leap onto <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> web occupant itself, or simply walk over the web for that purpose.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{species of}} these {{seemingly}} benign spiders invade webs of other spiders <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> host, the eggs, or the prey. In {{some cases the}} spider vibrates the web of other spiders, mimicking the struggle of trapped prey to lure {{the host of the}} web closer. Pholcids are natural predators of the Tegenaria species, and are known to attack and eat redback spiders, huntsman spiders, and house spiders. It is this competition that helps keep Tegenaria populations in check, which may be advantageous to humans who live in regions with dense hobo spider populations.|$|E
