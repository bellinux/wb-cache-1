5|$|An {{experimental}} fire-control {{director was}} fitted {{in the forward}} spotting top and evaluated in May 1910. The guns on the forward turret roof were transferred to the superstructure in 1913–1914 and the roof guns from the wing turrets were remounted in the aft superstructure about a year later; all of the four-inch guns in the superstructure were enclosed to better protect their crews. In addition, a single three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun was <b>added</b> <b>on</b> the former searchlight platform between the aft turrets. Shortly afterwards, the guns on the aft turret were removed as were one pair from the superstructure. Around the same time another three-inch AA gun {{was added to the}} aft turret roof.|$|E
5|$|As drive-through {{penalties}} are not admissible for appeal, McLaren's lawyer Mark Phillips QC {{attempted to}} convince the court that since the penalty was {{in the form of}} time <b>added</b> <b>on,</b> the case was valid. They presented the previous case of Vitantonio Liuzzi at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix, specifically the FIA's claim that the presiding chief steward at the race, Tony Scott Andrews, had admitted fault in awarding the penalty to Liuzzi. Andrews denied the FIA's allegation. McLaren went on to use the case as a precedent for the Spa incident. The Court stated that this analogy was invalid, since in Liuzzi's case the admissibility of his appeal was not contested.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{travelled}} to New Guinea {{at the end}} of June 1943 {{and arranged}} for Plasmodium falciparum cases to be evacuated to Cairns for treatment. As the flight time from Port Moresby to Cairns was only a few hours, this was considered safe, but since the disease can be fatal if not treated promptly, Fairley was concerned lest the cases be delayed for some reason. Movement Control suggested that a special priority be allocated to such cases, and Major General Frank Berryman suggested calling it priority Neil after Fairley himself. Because movement priorities had to have five letters, an extra L was <b>added</b> <b>on</b> the end. Priority Neill soon came to be applied to the entire Cairns project.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, {{the ship}} had an {{aircraft}} catapult installed, along with a crane to handle floatplanes. The following year, the single 8.8cm guns were replaced with a new triaxially stabilized twin-mount; two other twin mounts were <b>added</b> <b>on</b> the rear superstructure. Fire control directors for the anti-aircraft guns were also installed. After emerging from this refit, Königsberg was employed as a gunnery training ship. During the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s, the ship participated in non-intervention patrols, during which she forced Republicans to surrender a German freighter they had seized.|$|E
