6000|$|For {{suppose that}} all the species of Orchids, and not only they, but their congeners--the Gingers, the <b>Arrowroots,</b> the Bananas--are all the {{descendants}} of one original form, which was most probably nearly allied to the Snowdrop and the Iris. What then? Would that be one whit more wonderful, more unworthy of the wisdom and power of God, than if they were, as most believe, created each and all at once, with their minute and often imaginary shades of difference? What would the natural Theologian have to say, were the first theory true, save that God's works are even more wonderful that he always believed them to be? As for the theory being impossible: we must leave the discussion of that to physical students. It is not for us clergymen to limit the power of God. [...] "Is anything too hard for the Lord?" [...] asked the prophet of old; {{and we have a}} right to ask it as long as time shall last. If it be said that natural selection is too simple a cause to produce such fantastic variety: that, again, is a question to be settled exclusively by physical students. All we have to say on the matter is--That we always knew that God works by very simple, or seemingly simple, means; that the whole universe, as far as we could discern it, was one concatenation of the most simple means; that it was wonderful, yea, miraculous, in our eyes, that a child should resemble its parents, that the raindrops should make the grass grow, that the grass should become flesh, and the flesh sustenance for the thinking brain of man. Ought God to seem less or more august in our eyes, when we are told that His means are even more simple than we supposed? We held him to be Almighty and All-wise. Are we to reverence Him less or more, if we hear that His might is greater, His wisdom deeper, than we ever dreamed? We believed that His care was over all His works; that His Providence watched perpetually over the whole universe. We were taught--some of us at least--by Holy Scripture, to believe that the whole history of the universe was made up of special Providences. If, then, that should be true which Mr Darwin eloquently writes--"It may be metaphorically said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinizing, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up that which is good, silently and incessantly working whenever and wherever opportunity offers at the improvement of every organic being,"--if that, I say, were proven to be true: ought God's care and God's providence to seem less or more magnificent in our eyes? Of old it was said by Him without whom nothing is made, [...] "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work." [...] Shall we quarrel with Science, if she should show how those words are true? What, in one word, should we have to say but this?--We knew of old that God was so wise that He could make all things: but, behold, He is so much wiser than even that, that He can make all things make themselves.|$|E

The first commercial <b>arrowroot</b> in Pimpama was grown in the late 1860s, and the Lahey family, who moved to Pimpama in 1870 and eventually took up Sunnyside, adjoining William Doherty on Hotham Creek, went into <b>arrowroot</b> cultivation on a large scale, inventing a mechanical processing method which revolutionised the production of <b>arrowroot,</b> and marketing <b>arrowroot</b> under their own brand.

40|$|It was {{not until}} the early 1980 s, that CGPRT crops (coarse grains, pulses, roots and tubers) were {{recognized}} by research and development workers as an alternative source of food which could improve the diets of both rural and urban people in the developing world. These crops have an important role to play in subsistence and traditional farming and as industrial foodcrops, {{with a wide range of}} end-products. They are perhaps most vital in remote upland farming areas where the soil cannot sustain rice or wheat, for here they provide nourishment and income. Traditionally governments have placed a high priority on the production of rice and wheat as staple foods which are necessary for food security, and have therefore invested minimally in CGPRT crops. CGPRT crops include barley, maize, finger millet, teff, grain amaranth and millet; pigeonpea, chickpea, lentil, mungbean, black gram, pea, cowpea, lathyrus, groundnut, soybean, drybean and winged bean; yams, taro and <b>arrowroots,</b> cassava, potato and sweet potato. But during the past decade industrialization has given a new impetus to the production of some of these crops (especially soybean, maize and cassava) as raw materials for a growing feed industry and for the fast-food businesses which now partly dictate the consumption pattern of people in Asia. It was for this reason that in 1981 the Coarse Grains, Pulse, Roots and Tubers Centre (CGPRT) came into being in Bogor near Jakarta, under the auspices of the United Nations. Its objective is to initiate and promote research and training, and also to publish and supply information on socio-economic and related aspects of CGPRT crops in Asia and the Pacific. The Centre works hand-in-hand with other international research centres and universities, such as ICRISAT, CIMMYT, CIP, AVRDC, ACIAR, KIT, CIRAD, CIAT, IDRC and FAO. As a supplier of information, the Centre has established an Information and Documentation Service (IDS) to provide publication and distribution services; to gather, process and disseminate socio-economic data on CGPRT crops in Asia and the Pacific; and, through the database division, to process, collate and distribute information on these crops in the region. The IDS concentrates on the delivery of data on CGPRT crops to policy and decision-makers, researchers and to the private sector. The IDS collects socio-economic information on these crops for processing into user-focused formats. The Centre's publication programme allows independent authors to publish findings of relevant studies, and assists libraries and national agricultural research centres in establishing their own database systems. Since 1985 the Centre has published its own newsletter Palawija News, whose readership has increased from 300 to more than 3000.
