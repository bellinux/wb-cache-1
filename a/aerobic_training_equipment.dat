40|$|Background: Diabetes is {{associated}} with many metabolic disorders such as changes in adipokines like Vaspin and Chemerin. Effects of <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> on these adipokines in diabetic women is less studied. So, {{the aim of the}} present study was to survey effects of two <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> protocols on Vaspin, Chemerin and lipid profile in women with type 2 diabetes. Material and Methods: In a semi-experimental research design 36 women with type 2 diabetes were randomly divided into three groups: daily <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> group, five weeks training (n= 12), every other day <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> group, 10 weeks training (n= 12) and control group. <b>Aerobic</b> <b>training</b> was conducted with an intensity of 60 %- 70 % of maximum heart rate for 30 - 60 min. per session. Measurements and blood sampling were taken before, after 5 weeks and 10 weeks of training protocol. Data were analysed using a repeated measures analysis of variance and one-way ANOVA. The test significance level was taken as p< 0. 05. Results: Our measurements did not have a significant effect on weight (P= 0. 05), body fat percent (P= 0. 54), BMI (P= 0. 65) and Vaspin (P= 0. 59).

40|$|SummaryPurposeAerobic {{exercise}} {{training is}} a recognized approach for improving functional capacity in COPD. People with greater disease severity often have difficulty achieving higher <b>aerobic</b> exercise <b>training</b> intensity. The effects of resistance <b>training</b> prior to <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> were examined {{to determine if}} this sequential approach was associated with greater gains in functional status than <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> alone or concurrent <b>aerobic</b> and resistance <b>training.</b> MethodsPatients were randomized to: 1) sequential resistance then <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> (RT-then-AT) (8 weeks resistance training followed by 8 weeks <b>aerobic</b> exercise <b>training),</b> 2) control group (CE-then-AT + RT) (8 weeks of ‘sham’ training followed by 8 weeks concurrent <b>aerobic</b> and resistance <b>training),</b> 3) control group (CE-then-AT) (8 weeks ‘sham’ training followed by 8 weeks <b>aerobic</b> <b>training).</b> Outcomes were assessed at study entry, after week 8, and after week 16 : aerobic exercise performance; muscle strength and endurance. Results 75 patients completed training: FEV 1 %pred 40  ±  10, V˙ O 2 peak %predicted, 71  ±  22, fat-free mass index 19. 5  ±  3. 1. RT-then-AT had greater acquisition of peripheral muscle endurance than CE-then-AT + RT and CE-then-AT, but improvements in aerobic exercise performance were similar. Improvements in muscle strength were similar between RT-then-AT and CE-then-AT + RT. Sarcopenia was associated with poorer attendance, and lower <b>aerobic</b> and resistance <b>training</b> volumes. ConclusionAlthough the sequential approach to resistance and <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> yielded a greater increase in muscle endurance and higher resistance training volume compared to concurrent resistance and <b>aerobic</b> <b>training,</b> other training outcomes were similar between the two groups, thus the sequential approach is not clearly superior to the concurrent approach in severe COPD.

40|$|Background: <b>Aerobic</b> <b>training</b> {{can be done}} {{not only}} {{continuous}}ly, but also intermittently. Intermittent <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> aimed to get blood lactate level lower than continuous <b>aerobic</b> <b>training.</b> Blood lactate concentration {{in one of the}} various factors that determine training performance. However, until recently, little studies about intermittent <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> and blood lactate levels have been done. Therefore, this study aimed to measure blood lactate levels in Wistar rats after 4 and 12 weeks of intermittent <b>aerobic</b> <b>training.</b> Methods: 16 Wistar rats were divided into two groups, control and aerobic group. Every group was divided into two subgroups, 4 -week and 12 -week subgroup. <b>Aerobic</b> group performed <b>training</b> using T- 6000 treadmill with a speed of 20 m/minute for 20 minutes, with resting period for 90 seconds every 5 minute. Measurements of lactate level was done with L-lactate (PAP) Randox kit (LC 2389). Results: Blood lactate level in the 4 -week aerobic group was 2. 11 mmol/L, while that of the 4 -week control group was 1. 82 mmol/L (p > 0. 05). Meanwhile, lactate level in 12 -week aerobic group was 1. 71 mmol/L (p < 0. 05), and significantly lower than in 12 -week control group, which was 3. 03 mmol/L.

40|$|Introduction: Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{more prevalent}} in women than men and its incidence is in all age group. Patient with RA significantly experience more disability and co-morbidities including cardiovascular diseases in compared with people without RA and {{this is due to}} reduced physical activities in the patients. The effect of <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> on patients with RA is still unclear. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of 8 weeks <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> in patients with RA. Materials and Methods: Twenty three women (mean age 51. 96 ± 7. 73 yr and mean weight 72. 37 ± 10 kg) with a diagnosis of RA for more than three years and without any known cardiovascular and brain symptoms were voluntarily enrolled in the study. The patients were divided into <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> (n= 11) and control groups (n= 12). The patients in the aerobic group performed an <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> using a stationary bike (3 d/wk for 8 weeks). All subjects in this group were administered the same medicine at the same dose. A fasting blood sample was collected prior to and after 8 weeks of <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> from the patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Penile {{erection}} is a hemodynamic process involving increased arterial inflow {{and restricted}} venous outflow, coordinated with corpus cavernosum and penile arterial smooth muscle relaxation. Any {{problem in this}} mechanism results in Erectile Dysfunction and its etiology is generally multifactorial. This study is aimed at determining the objective outcome of <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> {{in the management of}} Erectile Dysfunction of arterogenic origin using Meta analysis. METHODS: Relevant publications were searched up to November 2010 in the MEDLINE (PubMed) database. The citation lists of randomized controlled trials on the effect of <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> and Erectile Dysfunction management using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) as treatment outcome measure. Studies on different operative techniques on the effects of <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> for men with Erectile Dysfunction due to arterogenic Erecile Dysfunction were selected. Data on participants’ characteristics, study quality, population, intervention, treatment outcome were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: There were 5 randomized controlled studies using the International Index of Erectile Function as measure of treatment outcome. A total of 385 subjects were involved in 5 studies; results indicated significant effect of <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> on Erecile Dysfunction (t= 5. 856, p =. 000) at p< 0. 05.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of eight weeks <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation in human blood leucocytes. Twenty untrained healthy students (training group: n = 10, age = 20. 7 ± 1. 5 yrs, weight = 67. 7 ± 10 kg, BF % = 17. 5 ± 7. 35 & control group: n = 10, age = 21 ± 1. 3 yrs, weight = 78. 5 ± 18. 5 kg, BF % = 18. 2 ± 6. 4) were randomly assigned to two groups and participated in an eight weeks <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> program. Blood samples were collected before and after the eight weeks <b>aerobic</b> <b>training.</b> mtDNA mutation were analyzed using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Although, all subjects were fairly young and the possibility of mtDNA mutation at normal condition was unlikely, just to be certain, all blood samples were also analyzed for possible mutation. Those subjects who had mutant mtDNA prior to the study, were excluded. The findings show that there were no changes in mtDNA mutation in human leucocytes in both groups before and after eight weeks <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> (P> 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract Background: Protein {{tyrosine}} phosphatase 1 B (PTP 1 B) is a {{key enzyme}} in dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) {{and it is a}} central factor to induce the insulin resistance. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of 12 -week <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> on protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 B gene expression and insulin resistance in diabetic rats. Materials and Methods: In this study, 16 Wistar rats were divided into <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> and control groups. After inducing diabetes intra protaneally, <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> group performed training protocol for 12 weeks and 5 session/week. The duration and speed of each session increased progressively as 18 to 26 m/min and 10 to 55 min, respectively. Then, blood and tissue (from gastrocnemius) sampling were carried out in diabetic rats. Insulin resistance markers and PTP 1 B gene expression were evaluated by commercial kits and Real-Time PCR method, respectively. Results: Findings showed that PTP 1 B significantly was decreased in diabetic rats of <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> group (p= 0. 0001). Also, glucose and insulin resistance significantly was decreased in <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> groups (p= 0. 02 and p= 0. 006, respectively). However, insulin in control rats was significantly increased (p= 0. 015). Conclusion: It seems that, current <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> protocol has capability to decrease PTP 1 B and insulin resistance in diabetic rats. Furthermore, the direct correlation between PTP 1 B and insulin illustrated that any changes in insulin resistance due to exercise training associated with diminution of negative regulation of insulin signaling pathway. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary focus}} {{of this study was}} to {{determine}} basal levels of myogenic (MRF 4, myogenin, MyoD), proteolytic (FOXO 3 A, atrogin- 1, MuRF- 1), myostatin, and mitochondrial (PGC- 1 α & Tfam) mRNA in elderly women before and after <b>aerobic</b> <b>training.</b> This approach was taken to gain insight into the molecular adaptations associated with our observed increases in whole muscle cross sectional area (CSA) (11 %, p< 0. 05), knee extensor muscle function (25 %, p< 0. 05) and aerobic capacity (30 %, p< 0. 05) with training. Nine elderly women (71 ± 2 y) underwent muscle biopsies obtained from the vastus lateralis before and after 12 -weeks of <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> on a cycle ergometer. Post training biopsy samples were acquired 48 hours after the last exercise session. <b>Aerobic</b> <b>training</b> reduced (p < 0. 05) resting levels of MRF 4 by 25 % while myogenin showed a trend to decrease (p = 0. 09) after training. FOXO 3 A expression was 27 % lower (p < 0. 05) while atrogin- 1 and MuRF- 1 were unaltered after training. Additionally, myostatin gene expression was decreased (p < 0. 05) by 57 % after <b>training.</b> Lastly, <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> did not alter PGC- 1 α or Tfam mRNA. These findings suggest that <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> alters basal transcript levels of growth related genes in skeletal muscle of older women. Further, the reductions in FOXO 3 A and myostatin indicate the <b>aerobic</b> <b>training</b> induced muscle hypertrophy in older women may be due to alterations in proteolytic machinery.
