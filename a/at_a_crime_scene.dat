5|$|Forensic firearm {{examination}} is {{the forensic}} process of examining {{the characteristics of}} firearms {{as well as any}} cartridges or bullets left behind <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene.</b> Specialists in this field are tasked with linking bullets and cartridges to weapons and weapons to individuals. Obliterated serial numbers can be raised and recorded in an attempt to find the registered owner of the weapon. Examiners can also look for fingerprints on the weapon and cartridges, and then viable prints can be processed through fingerprint databases for a potential match.|$|E
5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} stamping {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion of firing pin microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto the firing pin and is transferred to the cartridge during the firing process. Each firing pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace casings found <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> to a known firearm. The practice is not in use , although California has enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms. The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.|$|E

Dexter accompanies {{her to the hospital}} and then returns home, apparently with Debra. In the middle of the night, Brian breaks into Dexter's apartment and attempts to stab Debra, only to find a prosthetic body in her place; Dexter then chokes him unconscious with a garrote. In the refrigeration unit in Brian's apartment, Dexter ties him to the killing table with plastic wrap. After an emotionally charged conversation, Dexter slices his brother's throat and leaves him upside down to drain, staging it as a suicide. Dexter and Debra arrive <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene,</b> and he imagines {{what it would be like}} if everyone knew and happily accepted the truth about him.|$|E

He invites her to take a ride with him so he can show her. After driving, he sees a prostitute {{who appears to be}} gray to him. Fellig tells Scully that the woman will be dead very soon. A pimp approaches the woman and begins to harass her. Scully leaps out of the car with her gun, announcing that she is an FBI agent and handcuffing the pimp, but when the prostitute tries to flee, she is hit by a truck and killed.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} on when or where Bundy began killing women. He told different stories to different people, and refused to divulge the specifics of his earliest crimes, even as he confessed in graphic detail to dozens of later murders in the days preceding his execution. He told Nelson that he attempted his first kidnapping in 1969 in Ocean City, New Jersey, but did not kill anyone until sometime in 1971 in Seattle. He told psychologist Art Norman that he killed two women in Atlantic City in 1969 while visiting family in Philadelphia. To homicide detective Robert D. Keppel, he hinted at a murder in Seattle in 1972, and another in 1973 involving a hitchhiker near Tumwater, Washington, but refused to elaborate. Rule and Keppel both believe {{that he may have}} started killing as a teenager. Circumstantial evidence suggests that he abducted and killed 8-year-old Ann Marie Burr of Tacoma in 1961 when he was 14, an allegation he denied repeatedly. His earliest documented homicides were committed in 1974 when he was 27 years old. By then he had (by his own admission) mastered the necessary skills—in the era before DNA profiling—to leave minimal incriminating evidence <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dexter {{receives}} a voice message from his foster sister Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter), {{a police officer}} in the vice department and, Dexter believes, the only person who loves him. Debra says she is <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> and wants him to be there, because she needs his help. Dexter arrives and Debra, undercover as a prostitute, informs him that another hooker has been killed, the third in five months. Dexter inspects the victim and is shocked to learn that the chopped up corpse is bloodless. Dexter leaves, awed by the killer's technique, and says that {{due to the lack of}} blood he can't help out. At the police station, Dexter discusses another murder case being handled by James Doakes (Erik King), who hates Dexter and suspects he is hiding something. Dexter suggests that it was a crime of passion, rather than the bad drug deal Doakes believes it to be. Dexter surveils Jamie Jaworski, a murderer who escaped justice due to a faulty warrant, and breaks into his home to find proof of his crime. Once he confirms that Jaworski is guilty, Dexter meets with his girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), a domestic violence victim. Because of her violent past with her husband, Rita has no interest in sex, and Dexter secretly feels comfortable with the lack of intimacy. Rita has two young children, Astor and Cody, whom Dexter genuinely feels for. While on a date with Rita, Dexter finds another crime scene in which the victim has been cut into pieces with no traces of blood; this time, however, the head is missing. Dexter theorizes that the killer murders his victims in extreme cold, explaining the absence of blood. Dexter further suggests that a stolen refrigerated truck is being used for the murders. Dexter allows Debra to pitch the theory, but their superior officer, Lt. María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez), who dislikes Debra, dismisses it.|$|E
5000|$|Operation Virtual Shield is {{a program}} {{implemented}} by Chicago, IL mayor Richard M. Daley, which created the most extensive video surveillance network in the United States by linking more than 3000 surveillance cameras to a centralized monitoring system, which captures and processes camera feeds in real time.

25|$|Fingerprints {{collected}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene,</b> or {{on items}} of evidence from a crime, {{have been used}} in forensic science to identify suspects, victims and other persons who touched a surface. Fingerprint identification emerged as an important system within police agencies in the late 19th century, when it replaced anthropometric measurements as a more reliable method for identifying persons having a prior record, often under a false name, in a criminal record repository. In modern times, researchers can find traces of addictive drugs on just a fingerprint.|$|E
25|$|Because it is {{not always}} {{possible}} for the forensic entomologist to be present <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> to collect the appropriate evidence, it is important that clear and concise instructions are left for the handling of live and preserved specimens to those processing the scene. In these cases where the FE is not present at the scene, the transport of live and preserved specimens is necessary. As a rule, if specimens are in transport longer than an hour, they have to be kept in a chilled insulated container with enough coolant to keep them relatively inactive and stop their development.|$|E
25|$|To {{estimate}} insect age, forensic entomologists {{must determine}} {{the amount of}} time a particular insect spends in each stage of development and apply this information to temperature data <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> to determine a post-mortem interval estimation. Timing of various insect stages is determined in a laboratory at standardized temperatures so that ranges may be applied to the different temperature conditions encountered in the field. Post-mortem intervals are estimated by determining the accumulated degree days (ADD) or accumulated degree hours (ADH) acquired by each insect stage on the remains; this information is then used to calculate the overall degree days or degree hours accumulated during the insect’s entire life cycle and association with the carcass, representing the minimal amount of time the body has been available for colonization by insects. This estimation does not claim to represent an accurate time of death, but rather a minimal time of colonization. This is an important distinction that must be considered with the use of forensic evidence in courts of law.|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{a series}} of {{promising}} new tools are under development that will enable <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> investigators (CSIs) to analyze traces in situ during the <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> investigation or enable them to detect blood and provide information on the age of blood. An experiment is conducted with thirty CSIs investigating <b>a</b> violent robbery <b>at</b> <b>a</b> mock <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> to study the influence of such technologies on the perception and interpretation of traces during {{the first phase of}} the investigation. Results show that in their search for traces, CSIs are not directed by the availability of technologies, which is a reassuring finding. Qualitative findings suggest that CSIs are generally more focused on analyzing perpetrator traces than on reconstructing the event. A focus on perpetrator traces might become a risk when other crime-related traces are overlooked, and when analyzed traces are in fact not crime-related and in consequence lead to the identification of innocent suspects...|$|R
30|$|A {{forensic}} investigator arrives <b>at</b> <b>a</b> severe <b>crime</b> <b>scene.</b> Wearing <b>an</b> HMD, {{the investigator}} shares the local view with a remote colleague (R).

For that purpose, the remote colleague can augment the view of the local investigator with virtual laser scanning stickers, text, resizable geometric shapes, arrows, and text (P). During the scenario, the local investigator has the task to replace the virtual laser scanning stickers with real ones, stay clear of marked areas and support the remote colleague in investigating the scene (M). For the scenario, the training location needs to be prepared with mock-up blood patterns, mock-up evidence, e.g. a gun or knife, as well as evidence that is to be avoided, e.g. a mock-up dead body. Furthermore, it is necessary to establish an audio communication among the investigators (R).|$|R

[...] Digital Spys Dek Hogan described the plot as [...] "unnecessarily convoluted", and said the serial was [...] "downbeat, one paced and frankly monotonous ... quite why it took three hours to tell a tale that could easily have been told far more economically in one is a far bigger mystery than the one this unmemorable bunch of coppers were trying to solve." ...|$|R

500|$|Forensic {{scientists}} can use DNA in blood, semen, skin, saliva or hair found <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> {{to identify a}} matching DNA of an individual, such as a perpetrator.

In DNA profiling, the lengths of variable sections of repetitive DNA, such as short tandem repeats and minisatellites, are compared between people. This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for identifying a matching DNA. However, identification can be complicated if the scene is contaminated with DNA from several people. DNA profiling was developed in 1984 by British geneticist Sir Alec Jeffreys, and first used in forensic science to convict Colin Pitchfork in the 1988 Enderby murders case.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{demand for}} Cyber Forensics {{capabilities}} is growing rapidly. This places {{stress on the}} development of human resources that can cope with the requirements of Cyber Forensics. Suitable candidates with enough technical background, training or insight are not always available or retainable. The training of Cyber First Responders is therefore a challenge. Current material is mostly in the form of unstructured lists and requires a certain amount of understanding of the technical field from first responders, which they may not have, in order to make decisions as to what exactly to do <b>at</b> <b>a</b> cyber <b>crime</b> <b>scene.</b> In this paper the development and testing of Cyber First Responder Process Flows is discussed. A generic process flow framework is presented and design principles and layout characteristics as well as important points within the process flows are discussed. The positive impact of the process flows during cyber forensic first responder training is then indicated. The hypotheses that the process flows will speed up a cyber forensic investigation, even for experienced cyber forensic investigators, was tested and confirmed. The use of the process flows during Cyber Forensics operations is indicated. The paper concludes that the process flows was shown to be beneficial to first responders performing cyber forensic search and seizures, indicates that future work regarding enhancement and customisation of the process flows may be required, and suggest the use of the process flows in electronic format coupled to a case management system...|$|R
50|$|The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) led by Sethuram Iyer {{investigate}} {{an enigmatic}} murder {{that was made}} to look like a suicide. The movie opens with DySP Prabhakara Varma (Captain Raju) observing the local police force during a training drill. Another officer approaches him and informs him that he is needed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> recent <b>crime</b> <b>scene,</b> and they depart immediately. Varma arrives at the home of Ouseppachan (Janardhanan), a local businessman, and sees the body of Ouseppachans daughter-in-law, Omana (Lizy) on the grounds behind the house, in an apparent suicide. He is then introduced to Omanas husband Sunny, her father-in-law Ouseppachan, Ouseppachans son-in-law Johny (Vijayaraghavan), Ouseppachans best friend Narayan, and several of the household servants and neighbors (Adoor Bhavani, T.P.Madhavan). The initial report conducted by the first responders concluded that Omana had committed suicide by flinging herself from the roof of the two-story house onto the stone pavement below. Varma questions the members of the household as well as neighbors and servants about Omanas relationship with her husband Sunny (Sreenath). Sunny admits to arguing with Omana the night she died and throwing her onto their bed before leaving to drink, but swears he never hit her. He also tells Varma that Omana had attempted suicide before. Ouseppachan claims he came home from a business trip that night, dropped off by his driver, Vasu (Johny), only to find himself locked out of the house. He decided to go around the back to where the cooks quarters were located when he stumbled upon Omanas body. Dissatisfied with inconsistent testimonies from several suspects, Varma immediately suspects foul play and is determined to find the truth. The next morning, the Regional Medical Officer (Kollam Thulasi) concludes that Omana died from head trauma at 8pm the previous night.|$|R
40|$|There are {{numerous}} {{problems associated with}} the analysis of samples from mass produced goods if the resulting data are intended for use in court. Currently, many methods do not provide a definitive answer to the question if two chemically identical samples share the same provenance, so new techniques are being tested to overcome this problem. Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS) measures stable isotope abundance, a compound characteristic that can provide information as to the provenance of natural and synthetic substances. The potential use of IRMS to determine both source and origin of natural substances has been tested with some success identifying for example geographical origin of drugs such as heroin and cocaine (Ehleringer et al. 1999). The aim of this thesis was to study the application of stable isotope analytical techniques to two representatives of mass produced goods, namely architectural white paint and wooden safety matches. Existing analytical techniques are not sufficient for the forensic examination of architectural paint. The proposed solution was stable isotope profiling using IRMS. Background studies were carried out to determine potential intra and inter-batch variability of paint samples. This was followed by studies of 51 architectural white paints, which showed the considerable potential of stable isotope profiling when combined with likelihood ratios as a forensic statistical tool. The results from IRMS were compared to other analytical methods. Wooden matches are items commonly encountered <b>at</b> <b>a</b> variety of <b>crime</b> <b>scenes.</b> However prior to this thesis, no established comparative method of forensic analysis existed for this. type of sample. Wooden matches were analysed by IRMS and the results compared to microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Each of the techniques produced complimentary data and allowed the differentiation of two sets of matches seized in an actual criminal investigation. The analysis of burnt wooden matches by IRMS showed considerable potential for even when samoles were burnt.
