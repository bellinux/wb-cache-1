Foi visto e abordado que, ao encontrar-se nos grupos, passa a revelar-se o individualismo do sujeito ensimesmado na realização de atos em prol de si mesmo. O sujeito ensimesmado passa a concentrar em si mesmo a totalidade das coisas, do todo e de tudo, enclausurando-se. Considera-se, portanto, nesta tese, que a barbárie contemporânea tem seu engendramento por meio de novas formas de individualismo, com o nascimento do sujeito ensimesmado. The intellectual restlessness {{that has}} motivated this survey has set itself for defining the person enclosed within himself, clarifying the very beginning, developing his paths {{as a product}} and producer of the reasoning crisis and barbarity as well. The temporal cut has its beginning in the Renaissance, historical {{period in which the}} individual himself reaches a higher level of emancipation and human value (overvalued individuality) indeed. On that specific historical context, the collectiveness is relinquished, turning to individualism. The temporal cut of this thesis points specifically to the construction problem of the person enclosed within himself and his meeting with Brazilian contemporary society, involving with different social groups and their collective aims. It has been seen and approached that when someone is involved with social groups, the individualism of the person enclosed within himself is disclosed, egoistically carrying out his deeds on behalf of himself. The subject enclosed within himself began focusing on himself the totality of all things, from all to everything, enclosing himself. Therefore, this thesis holds the assumption that contemporary barbarity has its thresholds through new ways of individualism with the birth of the person enclosed inside himself...|$|R

40|$|É possível viver no mundo sem Deus? É possível viver no mundo sem religião? O autor deste texto apresenta uma resposta afirmativa a essas indagações, fundamentando-a com as ideias de Bertrand Russell. Para o autor, quando a noção de viver bem é fundamentada na verdade provisória da ciência e contrária à vida proposta pela religião, os fiéis e os representantes eclesiásticos utilizam argumentos emocionais e falaciosos para postular a verdade da fé. Ele parte do pressuposto de que entre religião e ciência há conflitos, e não diálogos. Os conflitos se instauram na medida em que se percebe que a verdade humana é de processos, erros e acertos, não de certezas. A certeza da existência de Deus e do plano divino se justifica a partir de argumentos emocionais, que no mais das vezes levam a atos de crueldade e violência, como mostra a história. Para melhor compreender de que maneira os argumentos emocionais dos fiéis são legitimados, o autor recorre ao caso pessoal de Russell, quando o filósofo se viu impedido de lecionar na Faculdade de Filosofia Municipal de Nova York, nos anos 40 do século XX, devido <b>a</b> seu pensamento <b>contrário</b> <b>à</b> religião. Palavras-chave : Ateísmo; Religião; Ciência; Fundamentalismo religioso.   Abstract Is it {{possible}} to live without God? Is {{it possible}} to live without religion {{in the midst of}} faithful? Starting from the premise of conflict, not dialogue, between religion and science, the author uses the ideas of Bertrand Russell to support affirmative answers to these questions. When the notion of the good life is based on the provisional truth of science, rather than on religion, the faithful and the ecclesiastic representatives postulate the truth of faith using emotional and fallacious arguments. The conflict between religion and science arises with the perception that human truth is based on processes, errors and successes, not on certainties. The conviction of the existence of God and of a divine plan is justified by emotional arguments, in general accompanied by acts of cruelty and violence, as we know from history. In order to improve our understanding of how the faithful attempt to justify their emotional arguments, the author cites Russell's case, when the philosopher was prevented from teaching at the College of the City of New York (CCNY), in the 1940 s due to his anti-religious ideas.
