5|$|Drinking {{water in}} Flagstaff is {{produced}} from conventional surface water treatment <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lake</b> Mary Water Treatment Plant, located on Upper Lake Mary, {{as well as}} from springs at the inner basin of the San Francisco Peaks. Groundwater from several water wells located throughout the city and surrounding area provide additional sources of drinking water. Water and wastewater services are provided by the City of Flagstaff.|$|E
5|$|Glacial {{debris and}} ice were {{probably}} present <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> with fan deltas at Tunupa overlapping the Lake Tauca shore. At Tunupa and Cerro Azanaques, glaciers reached their maximum size {{shortly before the}} lake level peaked and probably contributed to water levels when their retreat began. Two minor glacial advances, over 12,000 BP and about 11,000 BP, appear to coincide with Lake Tauca.|$|E
5|$|Harveys Lake was accidentally {{discovered}} by Benjamin Harvey in 1781. The first settlers arrived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> in the 1790s and 1800s. Early {{industries in the}} area included lumbering and farming, but it became well known as a summer resort {{in the latter part}} of the 1800s and into the 1900s. It was also used as a water supply in the early 1900s. However, the lake began to develop significant environmental problems in the 1960s and a total maximum daily load was created for it in 1994. Since 1968, the lake has been located in the borough of Harveys Lake.|$|E

5|$|Owing to the {{proliferation}} of beaches, boat ramps and jetties, the West Lake is the area most used by swimmers and vessels. A bike path also surrounds the lake, and riding, walking or jogging around the lake are a popular activity on the weekends. Fireworks are often held over the lake on New Year's Eve, and a large show called Skyfire has been held <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> since 1989.|$|E
5|$|The disorganized {{nature of}} the British retreat {{demonstrated}} a loss of effective command. An experienced commander could easily have encamped <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lake</b> George landing, taken stock of the situation, and begun siege operations against the French. Abercrombie, {{to the surprise of}} some in his army, ordered a retreat {{all the way back to}} the south end of Lake George. Nester, unable to find other rational reasons for this, claims that the general must have panicked.|$|E
50|$|Although {{swimming}} {{had previously}} been allowed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> park, since 1964 a prohibition against swimming has been strongly enforced. The ban came about after a boy drowned when turbid, sediment-laden water prevented lifeguards from seeing him. Conditions particular to <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> including <b>the</b> quantity of sediment <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake's</b> bottom and <b>the</b> prevailing currents <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake's</b> southern end, cause such murky and turbid conditions to be common, necessitating the ban on swimming.|$|R

5|$|Ursúa {{referred}} to the western port town of Ch'ich' as Nich. The modern name for a point {{on the south side}} of the bay is Punta Nijtún, which is probably derived from the colonial Yucatec nix tun, meaning stone ramp. Archaeologists carried out excavations <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> shore at Punta Nijtún and discovered a stone ramp there, which was probably built by Ursúa's troops to launch his galeota.|$|E
5|$|Various {{bird species}} have been {{observed}} {{in the vicinity of}} Harveys Lake. These include surf scoters and black scoters, which have been observed there in the winter. Although greater scaups are rare in Pennsylvania away from Lake Erie, one was observed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> in July 1992. Franklin's gulls have also been observed near the lake, as have snow buntings and black-legged kittiwakes, and ruddy ducks. Nine brant geese were observed on the lake in May 1997.|$|E
5|$|While the {{volcanic}} {{history of the}} area extends back far further, the earliest fully recognizable events {{in the region are}} recorded in the pyroclastic Campanario Formation.

5|$|Amésqueta left Mopán {{three days}} after Díaz and {{followed}} Díaz’s trail to the lakeshore. He arrived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> over a week later with 36 men. As they scouted along the south shore near Nojpetén they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance. Amésqueta was extremely suspicious of the small canoes being offered by the Itza to transport his party across to Nojpetén; as nightfall approached Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby. In {{the early hours of}} the morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight. At San Pedro Martír he received news of an Itza embassy to Mérida in December 1695, and an apparent formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish authority. Unable to reconcile the news with the loss of his men, and with appalling conditions in San Pedro Mártir, Amésqueta abandoned his unfinished fort and retreated to Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic midges (Chironomidae) {{provide the}} highest {{proportion}} of the fly life of the lake. The trout (Salmonidae) will feed at the surface on these and water boatmen (Corixidae), and below the surface on the caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae and pupae; they will also take the adult caddisflies when they emerge. Other aquatic fauna including daphnia and snails are {{also found in the}} lake. Large populations of dragonflies, including migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta) and significant numbers of ruddy darter (Sympetrum sanguineum), occur <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> Eleven species of wainscot moth make their home in the reed beds, including the nationally local brown-veined wainscot (Archanara dissoluta), twin-spotted wainscot (Archanara geminipuncta) and silky wainscot (Chilodes maritimus).|$|E
5|$|Back at home, Grampa babysits Bart and Lisa, who trick their {{grandfather}} into letting them throw their own party. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> the next morning, Homer tries to sneak away to go fishing, but Marge wakes up first. Marge is upset that Homer would choose fishing over their marriage, which Homer fails to understand as he visualizes Marge {{turning into a}} catfish. Homer takes a walk instead of returning to bed. On the dock, he finds an abandoned fishing pole. The pole, with General Sherman on the line, yanks him off the pier into a small rowboat, and onto the lake. From their cabin window, Marge watches Homer battle General Sherman and gets frustrated. At home, Bart and Lisa's party has ended and {{the house is a}} total mess. Watching Grampa cry and fearing that he will get in trouble, they frantically clean up the house for him.|$|E

5|$|Both Dio and Suetonius {{agree that}} gladiatorial {{contests}} and a wild-beast hunt, the venatio, also took place <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> area, but they again {{disagree on the}} details. Dio states this {{took place on the}} first day, with the lake covered over with planking and wooden stands erected around it, while Suetonius says the events occurred in the basin after the water had been let out. Suetonius writes that 5,000 animals were killed there in a single day. Although no record of the animals pursued in these hunts survives (Dio mentions hunts of cranes and elephants but does not give a location), larger exotic animals were popular, notably elephants, big cats and bears, though smaller game such as birds, rabbits and goats also featured.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the terrain}} {{surrounding}} the interchange {{and the location}} of the Irondequoit Bay Bridge, NY104 is forced to run parallel to NY590 for a short distance between the Keeler Street Expressway and NY590's next exit, a diamond interchange connecting to East Ridge Road. Through this stretch, NY590—now just four lanes wide—runs in between NY104 westbound and NY104 eastbound. At East Ridge Road, NY104 turns to the northeast to cross Irondequoit Bay while NY590 continues north through residential areas toward Sea Breeze. The road has an at-grade intersection with Sunrise Crescent, a private residential street, before meeting Titus Avenue at a roundabout that serves as NY590's northern terminus. Past this point, the right-of-way of NY590 continues north to Culver Road <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lake</b> Ontario shoreline as a divided two-lane street named Sea Breeze Drive.|$|E
5|$|During an {{ice skating}} field trip <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> some of Oskar's fellow {{students}} discover Jocke's body. At the same time, Oskar finally {{stands up to}} his tormentors and strikes {{the leader of the}} bullies, Conny, {{on the side of the}} head with a pole, splitting his ear. Some time later, Oskar shows Eli a private place he knows. Unaware that Eli is a vampire, Oskar suggests that they form a blood bond, and cuts his hand, asking Eli to do the same. Eli, thirsting for blood but not wanting to harm Oskar, laps up his spilled blood before running away. Lacke's girlfriend, Virginia, is subsequently attacked by Eli. Lacke turns up in time to interrupt the attack. Virginia survives, but soon discovers that she has become painfully sensitive to sunlight. Seeking Lacke, Virginia visits Gösta, only to be fiercely attacked by Gösta's cats. In the hospital, Virginia, who has realized what she has become, asks an orderly to open the blinds in her room. When the sunlight streams in, she bursts into flames.|$|E

5|$|Ganoga Lake {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau, {{just north}} of the Allegheny Front, which is the {{boundary}} between the dissected plateau to the north and the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians to the south. Kitchen Creek, which drains the lake, drops approximately 1,000feet (300m) in 2.25miles (3.62km) as it flows down the steep escarpment of the Allegheny Front. About 300to 250million years ago, the Allegheny Plateau, Allegheny Front, and Appalachian Mountains all formed in the Alleghenian orogeny. This happened long after the sedimentary rocks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> were deposited, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa collided with what became North America, forming Pangaea. In the years since, up to 5,000feet (1,500m) of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather. At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor in shaping the land around the lake today.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{the state of}} New York {{submitted}} a proposal to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials that would substantially alter how the Outer Loop was numbered. As part of the plan, the NY47 designation would be eliminated while the northwestern section of the Outer Loop—from I-490 in Gates to the proposed northern terminus <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lake</b> Ontario Parkway in Greece—would become the northernmost part of I-390. Most of the proposed changes took effect on March18, 1980, when NY47 was eliminated; however, I-390 was modified to end at its junction with I-490. In its place, the Gates–Greece leg of the Outer Loop was assigned NY390. The NY390 designation was extended northward to its current terminus in the early 1980s when the segment of the Outer Loop between NY104 and the Lake Ontario State Parkway was completed.|$|E
