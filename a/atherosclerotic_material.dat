This study shows that fresh human <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>material</b> (aneurysms and endarterectomies) can contain detectable amounts of redox active iron and copper that is chelatable from tissue homogenates. Such material is often prooxidant towards lipid peroxidation and deoxyribose degradation. Aneuryems and endarterectomies contain ferroxidase 1 activities, whereas only in aneurysms could caeruloplasmin be immunologically detected. Ferroxidase 2 activity, characteristic of a copper-oxidised lipoprotein complex, could not, however, be detected {{in any of the}} atherosclerotic samples. A third ferroxidase activity, attributable to xanthine oxidase, was present in several aneurysms and endarterectomies...|$|E
40|$|Percutaneous atherectomy {{was first}} {{introduced}} {{as an alternative to}} balloon angioplasty (BA) in 1986 to improve the results that could be achieved with BA [1]. The advantages of atherectomy were the creation of a smooth luminal surface with less local thrombosis and the reduction of elastic recoil because the lumen can widen without stretching the arterial wall. In percutaneous atherectomy the atheromatous intima usually occurs with or without the media. The notion that the ‘‘bad’ ’ atheroma would be removed is also an appealing feature of this technique. Atherectomy can be divided into extirpative atherectomy, which means cutting and/or shaving and removing the <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>material</b> from the patient, and ablative atherectomy, where the atheroma is fragmented with a high-speed device.

A {{significant number of}} patients undergoing cardiac surgical procedures require perioperative intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. Use of an IABP {{has been linked to}} an increased incidence of perioperative renal dysfunction and death. This might be due to dislodgement of <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>material</b> in the descending thoracic aorta (DTA). Therefore, we retrospectively studied the correlation between DTA atheroma, AKI and in-hospital mortality. Methods: A total of 454 patients were retrospectively matched to one of four groups: -IABP/-DTA atheroma, +IABP/-DTA atheroma, -IABP/+DTA atheroma, +IABP/+DTA atheroma. Patients were then matched according to presence/absence of DTA atheroma, presence/absence of IABP, performed surgical procedure, age, gender and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). DTA atheroma was assessed through standard transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) imaging studies of the descending thoracic aorta.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: T-cell {{activation}} is {{an essential}} feature of atherosclerotic plaque inflammation, which eventually may lead to plaque rupture. In this study, we investigated if EBV, a common herpes virus, is capable of stimulating atherosclerotic plaque derived T-cells and thus could contribute to atherosclerotic plaque inflammation. METHODS: Plaque derived T-cell cultures were established from symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic plaques of 19 patients. B-cells from the same patients were transformed with EBV to form lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) that served as antigen presenting cells. The proliferation of T-cells {{in the presence of}} autologous B-LCL was analyzed using 3 H-thymidine incorporation. The presence of EBV in <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>material</b> was analyzed by PCR. RESULTS: Of the 19 cell obtained T-cell cultures, 11 responded to EBV (58 %, mean stimulation index: 10. 1 +/- 3. 1). PCR analysis showed that EBV DNA was present in 15 of the tissue samples (79 %). All the specimens that contained EBV responding T-cells also contained EBV. EBV specific T-cells secreted granzymes, as indication of functional cytotoxic potential. CONCLUSIONS: EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cells and EBV DNA can be frequently observed in human atherosclerotic plaques. This suggests that a T-cell response against EBV could contribute to plaque inflammation, and thus to the onset of acute clinical symptom...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProtruding atheromas of the {{aortic arch}} {{identified}} by transesophageal echocardiography have been implicated {{as a cause}} of stroke in elderly patients. One hundred thirty patients ≥ 65 years of age were studied with intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography to detect aortic arch protruding atheromas and determine if these patients were at higher risk for perioperative stroke. Protruding atheromas were identified in 23 (18 %) of 130 patients. In 19 (83 %) of these 23 patients, palpation of the aortic arch at operation did not identify significant abnormalities. Five patients (4 %) had perioperative stroke. Logistic regression identified aortic arch atheroma as the only historical or procedural variable that was predictive of stroke (odds ratio 5. 8, 95 % confidence interval 1. 2 to 27. 9, p < 0. 03). A history of peripheral or cerebrovascular disease, presence of aortic calcification, cardiac risk factors, age and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass did not predict stroke. In contrast, patients with protruding atheromas with mobile components were at highest risk. There were 3 (25 %) of 12 patients with a mobile atheroma who had a stroke versus 2 (2 %) of 118 patients without a mobile atheroma (chi-square = 10. 3, p = 0. 001).

Whether FKN {{is expressed}} throughout all stages of atherosclerotic disease and whether it directly contributes to monocyte recruitment to atherosclerotic lesions is not known. We collected human <b>atherosclerotic</b> plaque <b>material</b> and blood samples from patients with carotid artery disease undergoing endarterectomy.

40|$|The serine {{protease}} thrombin is a mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells. To that end, thrombin cleaves the surface-exposed, protease-activated receptor type 1 (PAR- 1), resulting in signal transduction and ultimately, proliferation of these cells. Regulation of thrombin {{activity in the}} human atherosclerotic vessel wall has not been studied in great detail, conceivably because the traditional plasma thrombin inhibitor, anti-thrombin III, is not encountered at this location. By using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, we demonstrate that the antigens of thrombin, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI- 1), and vitronectin (Vn) colocalize in human neointimal atherosclerotic arterial tissue. Furthermore, it is shown by in situ reverse zymography that these specimens harbor the active form of PAI- 1, {{which is the only}} configuration of PAI- 1 capable of complexing with Vn and inhibiting {{serine protease}}s, eg, thrombin. Two different criteria were used to establish that neointimal <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>material</b> contains active alpha-thrombin, namely, its ability to bind to the thrombin inhibitor hirudin and to convert the thrombin-specific chromogenic substrate S 2238. The latter activity could be fully prevented by preincubation with the thrombin-specific inhibitor, phenyl-prolyl-arginyl-chloromethyl ketone. The thrombin concentration measured by conversion of the chromogenic substrate was 7 to 12 nmol/L in the vascular specimens studied. This concentration range suffices to activate the PAR- 1 receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells and to cause neointimal proliferation. It is concluded that the human atherosclerotic arterial vessel wall provides conditions that favor a regulatory mechanism of thrombin activity by PAI- 1 /Vn complexe...|$|E
40|$|Microvascular {{obstruction}} (MVO) commonly occurs following percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), {{may lead}} to myocardial injury, and is an independent predictor of adverse outcome. Severe MVO may manifest angiographically as reduced flow in the patent upstream epicardial arteries, {{a situation that is}} termed “no-reflow. ” Microvascular obstruction can be broadly categorized according to the duration of myocardial ischemia preceding PCI. In “interventional MVO” (e. g., elective PCI), obstruction typically involves myocardium that was not exposed to acute ischemia before PCI. Conversely “reperfusion MVO” (e. g., primary PCI for acute myocardial infarction) occurs within a myocardial territory that was ischemic before the coronary intervention. Interventional and reperfusion MVO have distinct pathophysiological mechanisms and may require individualized therapeutic approaches. Interventional MVO is triggered predominantly by downstream embolization of <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>material</b> from the epicardial vessel wall into the distal microvasculature. Reperfusion MVO results from both distal embolization and ischemia-reperfusion injury within the subtended ischemic tissue. Management of MVO and no-reflow may be targeted at different levels: the epicardial artery, microvasculature, and tissue. The aim of the present report is to advocate a systematic approach to prevention and treatment of MVO in different clinical settings. Randomized clinical trials have studied strategies for prevention of MVO and no-reflow; however, the efficacy of measures for reversing MVO once no-reflow has been demonstrated angiographically is unclear. New approaches for prevention and treatment of MVO will require a better understanding of intracellular cardioprotective pathways such as the blockade of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore...|$|E

40|$|Myocardial infarction, {{a leading}} cause of death intheWesternworld(1), usually occurs when the fibrous cap {{overlying}} an atherosclerotic plaque in a coronary artery ruptures. The resulting exposure of blood to the <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>material</b> then triggers thrombus formation, which occludes the artery(2). The importance of genetic predisposition to coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction is best documented by the predictive value of a positive family history(3). Nextgeneration sequencing in families with several affected individuals has revolutionized mutation identification(4). Here we report the segregation of two private, heterozygous mutations in two functionally relatedgenes, GUCY 1 A 3 (p. Leu 163 Phefs* 24) andCCT 7 (p. Ser 525 Leu), in an extended myocardial infarction family. GUCY 1 A 3 encodes the alpha 1 subunit of soluble guanylyl cyclase (alpha 1 -sGC) (5), and CCT 7 encodes CCT eta, a member of the tailless complex polypeptide 1 ring complex(6), which, among other functions, stabilizes soluble guanylyl cyclase. After stimulation with nitric oxide, soluble guanylyl cyclase generates cGMP, which induces vasodilation and inhibits platelet activation(7). Wedemonstratein vitro that mutations inbothGUCY 1 A 3 and CCT 7 severely reduce alpha 1 -sGC as well as beta 1 -sGC protein content, and impair soluble guanylyl cyclase activity. Moreover, platelets from digenic mutation carriers contained less soluble guanylyl cyclase protein and consequently displayed reduced nitric-oxideinduced cGMP formation. Mice deficient in alpha 1 -sGC protein displayed accelerated thrombus formation in themicrocirculation after local trauma. Starting with a severely affected family, we have identified a link between impaired soluble-guanylyl-cyclase-dependent nitric oxide signalling and myocardial infarction risk, possibly through accelerated thrombus formation. Reversing this defect may provide a new therapeutic target for reducing the risk of myocardial infarction...|$|E

40|$|Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Revascularization (PTCR) is now {{a widely}} {{accepted}} treatment modality for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. Current multicenter randomized trials comparing PTCR with the more invasive Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting could not show long-term significant survival differences. During {{the last two decades}} progress has been made to further optimize PTCR. The most logic approach to treat atherosclerotic coronary narrowings is to remove the <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>material</b> using especially developed devices. Several trials, however, could not show a significant beneficial outcome after use of these devices compared to plain old balloon angioplasty. Another approach was to implant a coronary prothesis (stent), scaffolding the diseased coronary artery after PTCA. This approach resulted in a decreased restenosis rate at follow-up. The beneficial effects of stenting, however, was not found {{to be related to the}} inhibition of the neointimal cellular proliferation after vascular injury, but simply to be the mechanical result of overstretching of the treated vessel segment. The most important remaining clinical problem after stenting remains the neointimal hyperplasia within the stent, resulting in a significant stent narrowing in 13 to 30 % of patients. Further efforts to improve the clinical results of coronary stenting should focus on the reduction of this neointimal hyperplasia. Neointimal hyperplasia after stent implantation results from (1) a healing response to the injury caused by the stent implantation and (2) a foreign body response to the stent itself. Factors that seem to influence the neointimal hyperplastic response are genetic, local disease related, stent delivery related and stent related factors. Biocompatibilisation of coronary stents by looking for more biocompatible metal alloys, optimized surface characteristics and optimized stent designs should result in a better late patency.

Coronary angiography was performed and the angiograms were evaluated by two cardiologists. Moreover, blood samples were collected after a 14 -hour fast immediately before the coronary angiography in order to measure the total cholesterol, HDL- cholesterol, and glucose. The patients were divided into four groups to evaluate the severity of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) according to Syntax scoring system. Results: The study results revealed a significant difference among the four study groups regarding the iron serum level. It was significantly higher in the sever atherosclerosis group compared to the normal (P= 0. 0122), mild (P= 0. 023), and moderate CAD groups (P< 0. 001). Conclusions: The findings indicated that the serum level of iron was higher in the atherosclerotic patients and increased with the severity of CAD.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} intravascular ultra-sound (IVUS) before and after directional atherectomy (DA) {{in the treatment of}} femoropopliteal artery stenosis. Methods: In 12 patients with 16 stenoses IVUS was performed before and immediately after an angiograph-ically successful DA. This was defined as a diameter reduction (DR) ¡ 50 %, which was calculated using the minimal lumen diameter compared with the diameter of a nearby ‘‘normal’ ’ segment. In the presence of re-sidual plaque on IVUS an additional DA was per-formed. Endpoints studied were DR ¡ 30 % on IVUS compared with the IVUS findings of the angiographi-cally normal reference segment, or when no additional <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>material</b> could be removed by further DA passages. Results: Additional DA (mean 1. 6 per lesion) had to be performed in all patients. Initial DA increased the cross-sectional free lumen area (FLA) from 3. 8 { 2. 0 mm 2 to 8. 1 { 2. 7 mm 2 (p 0. 0004). Additional DA increased FLA to 9. 3 { 2. 3 mm 2 (p 0. 002) after the second passage and to 9. 8 { 2. 4 mm 2 (p 0. 09) after the final DA run. The plaque area (PLA) before DA decreased from 18. 1 { 4. 2 mm 2 to 15. 4 { 4. 8 mm 2 (p 0. 002) after the first passage, and to 13. 5 { 5. 0 mm 2 (p 0. 004) and 12. 8 { 4. 4 mm 2 (p 0. 07) after the second and final DA runs, respectively. PLA of the reference segment (9. 5 { 5. 7 mm 2) was significantly smaller (p 0. 006) than the final PLA of the treated lesion, indicating a large amount of retained plaque. A...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{validated}} coronary angioscopic observations with histologic {{assessment of}} material removed by atherectomy. Background. Up to now, angioscopic {{findings have been}} primarily descriptive, and the clinical significance {{still needs to be}} substantiated. The proposed Ermenonville classification is relevant but has not yet been validated by histomorphologic analysis. Methods. We compared angioscopic findings in patients with different coronary syndromes and used <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>material</b> retrieved by directional coronary atherectomy to validate the angioscopic observations. Coronary angioscopy was performed in 63 patients (56 men, 7 women) with stable (26 patients) and unstable angina (37 patients) before and after directional coronary atherectomy. The identity of atherectomized material was confirmed by ex vivo visualization with the angioscope and by postatherectomy angioscopy. Angioscopic and histologic findings could be compared in 44 of 63 patients. Results. Angioscopic findings were grouped into gray-white and yellow lesions (gray-yellow, deep yellow, yellow-red or yellow-pink). We found that patients with unstable angina had predominantly yellow lesions (89 %). In patients with stable angina, gray-white (43 %) or yellow (57 %) lesions were similarly distributed. Ruptured yellow plaques and red or pink thrombi were identified in 11 % of patients with stable angina and 39 % of patients with unstable or early postmyocardial infarction angina. Histologically, gray-white lesions represented fibrous plaque without degeneration in 64 % and with degeneration in 36 % of patients. Gray-yellow lesions were associated predominantly with degenerated plaque (64 %) and, to a lesser extent, with fibrous plaque (14 %) or atheroma (14 %). Deep yellow and yellow-red lesions represented either atheroma (53 %) or degenerated plaque (42 %). Conclusions. Our study establishes a histomorphologic basis for classification and interpretation of angioscopic findings. Yellow plaque color is closely related to degenerated plaque or atheroma and is associated with unstable coronary syndromes...|$|E

Myocardial infarction, {{a leading cause of}} death in the Western world, usually occurs when the fibrous cap overlying an atherosclerotic plaque in a coronary artery ruptures. The resulting exposure of blood to the <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>material</b> then triggers thrombus formation, which occludes the artery. The importance of genetic predisposition to coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction is best documented by the predictive value of a positive family history. Next-generation sequencing in families with several affected individuals has revolutionized mutation identification. Here we report the segregation of two private, heterozygous mutations in two functionally related genes, GUCY 1 A 3 (p. Leu 163 Phefs* 24) and CCT 7 (p. Ser 525 Leu), in an extended myocardial infarction family. GUCY 1 A 3 encodes the α 1 subunit of soluble guanylyl cyclase (α 1 -sGC), and CCT 7 encodes CCTη, a member of the tailless complex polypeptide 1 ring complex, which, among other functions, stabilizes soluble guanylyl cyclase. After stimulation with nitric oxide, soluble guanylyl cyclase generates cGMP, which induces vasodilation and inhibits platelet activation. We demonstrate in vitro that mutations in both GUCY 1 A 3 and CCT 7 severely reduce α 1 -sGC as well as β 1 -sGC protein content, and impair soluble guanylyl cyclase activity. Moreover, platelets from digenic mutation carriers contained less soluble guanylyl cyclase protein and consequently displayed reduced nitric-oxide-induced cGMP formation. Mice deficient in α 1 -sGC protein displayed accelerated thrombus formation in the microcirculation after local trauma. Starting with a severely affected family, we have identified a link between impaired soluble-guanylyl-cyclase-dependent nitric oxide signalling and myocardial infarction risk, possibly through accelerated thrombus formation. Reversing this defect may provide a new therapeutic target for reducing the risk of myocardial infarction...|$|E

Total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and Lp(a) levels were compared with those of 73 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Results atheromatous lesions were localised in the femoropopliteal (≈ 60 %) and aortoiliac (≈ 40 %) segments. The number of stenosed arteries was ≥ 2 and the range of stenosis severity was between 40 % and 100 %. There was a significant increase in serum Lp(a) (p= 0. 000001) and a decrease in serum HDL (p= 0. 000009) levels in patients compared to controls. No difference was observed in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol or triglyceride. However, the ratio of total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol was significantly higher (p= 0. 005) in patients.

40|$|Background: In most {{models of}} {{experimental}} thrombosis, healthy blood vessels are damaged. This {{results in the}} formation of a platelet thrombus that is stabilized by ADP signaling via P 2 Y 12 receptors. However, such models do not predict involvement of P 2 Y 12 in the clinically relevant situation of thrombosis upon rupture of atherosclerotic plaques. We investigated the role of P 2 Y 12 in thrombus formation on (collagen-containing) atherosclerotic plaques in vitro and in vivo,by using a novel mouse model of atherothrombosis. Methodology: Plaques in the carotid arteries from Apoe 2 / 2 mice were acutely ruptured by ultrasound treatment, and the thrombotic process was monitored via intravital fluorescence microscopy. Thrombus formation in vitro was assessed in mouse and human blood perfused over collagen or plaque material under variable conditions of shear rate and coagulation. Effects of two reversible P 2 Y 12 blockers, ticagrelor (AZD 6140) and cangrelor (AR-C 69931 MX), were investigated. Principal Findings: Acute plaque rupture by ultrasound treatment provoked rapid formation of non-occlusive thrombi, which were smaller in size and unstable in the presence of P 2 Y 12 blockers. In vitro, when mouse or human blood was perfused over collagen or <b>atherosclerotic</b> plaque <b>material,</b> blockage or deficiency of P 2 Y 12 reduced the thrombi and increased embolization events.

Invasive and colour Doppler energy (CDE) assessments of haemodynamics and wall mechanics were performed at 24 h (n= 4) and 5 months (n= 10). Immuno-histolabelling of cell proliferation and histomorphometry were serially performed in perfusion fixed SFA samples. Results : at 24 h, PCNA-positive nuclei revealed 33 ± 14 and 12 ± 3 proliferating cells/mm 2 at placebo and molsidomine PTA-LDD sites, respectively (p< 0. 001). At 5 months, PTA-LDD-M vessels, compared with PTA-LDD-P, had increased compliance (66 ± 9 vs 11 ± 4 ml/mmHg) and lowered impedance (0. 11 ± 0. 05 vs 0. 45 ± 0. 14 mmHg/ml min− 1) (p< 0. 05). CDE revealed low, {{middle and high}} velocity peaks at 7. 5, 20 and 35, and 8, 15 and 22 cm s− 1 in systolic and diastolic flows, respectively; and PTA-LDD-M prevented emergence of restenosis-associated increases in low blood velocities (p< 0. 01). PTA-LDD-M inhibited restenotic intimal thickening and medial thinning which decreased mean lumenal diameter in placebo-treated (2. 6 ± 0. 3) as compared to molsidomine-treated (3. 4 ± 0. 3 mm) vessels (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Atherosclerosis, {{leading to}} stroke and {{coronary}} artery disease, {{is a major}} cause of morbidity and mortality in the Western world. In the early stages atherosclerotic plaques are invisible with luminographic techniques, because they develop without narrowing the arterial lumen. Therefore all luminographic techniques, conventional X-ray angiographie as well as magnetic resonance (MR) or computed tomography (CT) angiographie, frequently underestimate the true burden of atherosclerosis and are not able to predict sites of subsequent clinical events. It is well etablished that the risk of an acute cardiologic event mediated by plaque rupture is predicated upon the composition of atherosclerotic plaque rather than the degree of luminal narrowing. Plaques with a large necrotic lipid core and a thin fibrous cap must be considered vulnerable and are associated with a high risk of plaque rupture. However, not all vulnerable plaques must to yield to cardiovascular events. A contrast agent that selectively enhances atherosclerotic plaque or plaque compounds could clearly improve the non-invasive detection and/or characterization of atherosclerotic lesions and would be of a great clinical interest. In the present examination two Gd-based MRI contrast agents (model compounds) from the Schering AG Berlin were investigated {{on the basis of a}} WHHL rabbit atherosclerosis model. For this purpose, the model-compounds were histologically detected in immunhistochemical and histochemical characterized plaques by fluorescence microscopy. In the MRI examination the compounds were able to raise the signal intensity in the rabbit aorta. The atherosclerotic changes in arterial wall were validated with help of histological examination after imaging. Both compounds enrich in the extracellular, lipid-rich, collagen-rich, edemateus and acellular plaquematrix. The cells from the MPS are not involved in contrast agent enrichement in the plaque. The target of the contrast agents seems to be the acellular, fibrous, fatty and necrotic core, which plays an important role in vulnerabilty of plaques. In addition the optimal time for MR-examination after application of the contrast agent could be identified. In a second study the mechanism of contrast agent enrichment was examined wih atherosclerotic aortic sections from WHHL-rabbits in vitro. This should help to develop a new in vitro model for examinations of human <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>material.</b> Gadophrin- 2 was able to enrich qualitative and quantitative likewise the in vivo studies after 5 minutes inkubation. Not so Gadofluorine-M: It enriched just behind the endothelial layer. A third contrast agent, ultrasmall superparamagnetic oxids (USPIOs), did not enrich anywhere.

40|$|We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the study by Sztriha et al 1 evaluating the early clinical outcome in a large sample of unprotected carotid artery stenting procedures. Although randomized studies comparing endovascular treatment with endarterectomy are showing encouraging results {{in favor of the}} endovascular approach, 2, 3 cerebrovascular complications can occur during and in the early period after the procedure. Whereas intraprocedural complications may be caused by carotid plaque embolization and then they may be affected by the expertise of the physicians performing the procedures and by the development in endovascular technologies {{such as the use of}} protection devices, the etiopathogenesis of the cerebrovascular symptoms occurring after the end of the procedure may be unclear. Sztriha et a observed cerebrovascular complications in 14 of 245 (5. 4 %) consecutive patients included in their study; most of these (9 / 14 [64. 3 %]) occurred after the procedure and involved the vascular territory of the carotid artery undergone to stenting (8 / 9 [88. 9 %]), but neither restenosis nor reperfusion damage was present. Also, Qureshi et a reported periprocedural cerebrovascular complications in 14 of 111 (13 %) patients and mostly (71. 4 %) after the procedure. Can the passage of <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>material</b> through the stent mesh explain postprocedural embolization? We observed the case of a 73 -year-old women treated with stenting for symptomatic 80 % right internal carotid artery stenosis proven by selective angiography according to North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria. The intracranial angiogram obtained by selective injection of right internal carotid artery showed a moderate stenosis of the right pericallosal artery (Figure). Transcranial Doppler evaluation showed low mean flow velocity (38 cm/s) in the right carotid siphon and blood flow inversion in the right anterior cerebral artery precommunicating tract. A self-expanding stent (Carotid Wallstent monorail, Boston Scientific) was deployed inside the carotid artery and a residual stenosis degree 30 % was obtained. The next day, the patient experienced sudden motor impairment in the distal segment of her left leg without other neurological deficits. Carotid duplex scanner examination excluded restenosis and transcranial Doppler showed normal mean flow velocity (62 cm/s) on the right carotid siphon and normal blood flow direction with normal mean flow velocity values (54 cm/s) in the right anterior cerebral artery precommunicating tract. Moreover, transcranial Doppler monitoring prolonged for minutes on the right middle cerebral artery showed no microembolic event. Cranial MR diffusion-weighted image performed 12 hours after the onset of symptoms revealed an area of recent ischemia in the right frontomesial cortex located in the vascular territory of the stenosed pericallosal artery (Figure). This case shows that the postprocedural complication was likely caused by the intracranial hemodynamic changes after cerebral reperfusion. Particularly, the increase of blood flow velocity in the intracranial right carotid artery territory after revascularization could determine the detachment of embolic debris from the pericallosal artery stenosis leading to the frontal medial infarction. Therefore, we suggest that the presence of intracranial stenoses distal to cervical arteries stenoses should be considered during selection of candidates to endovascular treatment because they might be represent a harbinger of postprocedural cerebral ischemic complications...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the roles and}} signaling pathways of CD 40 L and CD 40 in platelet-platelet interactions and thrombus formation under conditions relevant for atherothrombosis. Platelets from mice prone to atherosclerosis lacking CD 40 L (Cd 40 lg(-/-) Apoe(-/-)) showed diminished αIIbβ 3 activation and α-granule secretion in response to glycoprotein VI stimulation, whereas these responses of CD 40 -deficient platelets (Cd 40 (-/-) Apoe(-/-)) were not decreased. Using blood from Cd 40 lg(-/-) Apoe(-/-) and Cd 40 (-/-) Apoe(-/-) mice, the glycoprotein VI-dependent formation of dense thrombi was impaired on <b>atherosclerotic</b> plaque <b>material</b> or on collagen, in comparison with Apoe(-/-) blood. In all genotypes, addition of CD 40 L to the blood enhanced the growth of dense thrombi on plaques and collagen. Similarly, CD 40 L enhanced glycoprotein VI-induced platelet aggregation, even with platelets deficient in CD 40. This potentiation was antagonized in Pik 3 cb(R/R) platelets or by inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase β (PI 3 Kβ). Addition of CD 40 L also enhanced collagen-induced Akt phosphorylation, which was again antagonized by absence or inhibition of PI 3 Kβ. Finally, platelets from Chuk 1 (A/A) Apoe(-/-) mice deficient in IκB kinase α (IKKα), implicated in CD 40 signaling to nuclear factor (NF) κB, showed unchanged responses to CD 40 L in aggregation or thrombus formation. Under atherogenic conditions, CD 40 L enhances collagen-induced platelet-platelet interactions by supporting integrin αIIbβ 3 activation, secretion and thrombus growth via PI 3 Kβ, but not via CD 40 and IKKα/NFκB. This role of CD 40 L exceeds the no more than modest role of CD 40 in thrombus formatio...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{oxidation}} of lipids {{has long}} been a topic of interest in biological and food sciences, and the fundamental principles of non-enzymatic free radical attack on phospholipids are well established, although questions about detail of the mechanisms remain. The number of end products that are formed following the initiation of phospholipid peroxidation is large, and is continually growing as new structures of oxidized phospholipids are elucidated. Common products are phospholipids with esterified isoprostane-like structures and chain-shortened products containing hydroxy, carbonyl or carboxylic acid groups; the carbonyl-containing compounds are reactive and readily form adducts with proteins and other biomolecules. Phospholipids can also be attacked by reactive nitrogen and chlorine species, further expanding the range of products to nitrated and chlorinated phospholipids. Key to understanding the mechanisms of oxidation is the development of advanced and sensitive technologies that enable structural elucidation. Tandem mass spectrometry has proved invaluable in this respect and is generally the method of choice for structural work. A number of studies have investigated whether individual oxidized phospholipid products occur in vivo, and mass spectrometry techniques have been instrumental in detecting a variety of oxidation products in biological samples such as <b>atherosclerotic</b> plaque <b>material,</b> brain tissue, intestinal tissue and plasma, although relatively few have achieved an absolute quantitative analysis. The levels of oxidized phospholipids in vivo is a critical question, as there is now substantial evidence that many of these compounds are bioactive and could contribute to pathology. The challenges for the future will be to adopt lipidomic approaches to map the profile of oxidized phospholipid formation in different biological conditions, and relate this to their effects in vivo.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Macrophage {{migration}} inhibitory factor (MIF) is {{an inflammatory}} cytokine released mainly from macrophages and activated lymphocytes. Both atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are inflammatory diseases tightly {{linked to the}} function of these cells. The correlation and contribution of MIF to these human diseases remain unknown, although a recent rabbit study showed expression of this cytokine in <b>atherosclerotic</b> lesions. <b>Material</b> and Methods: MIF immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue sections from five normal aortas, seven atherosclerotic carotids, and six AAAs. A group of 112 men with small AAAs (defined as 3 to 5 cm) was recruited {{at the time of}} diagnosis, had serum samples taken, and was followed annually for 1 to 5 years (mean, 2. 9 years) and referred for surgery if the AAA exceeded 5 cm in diameter. Of this study group, 98 had serum MIF measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 61 had detectable levels. Results: In human atherosclerotic and aneurysmal lesions, MIF protein colocalized in macrophages, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, but normal arteries had negligible MIF expression. Furthermore, serum-MIF levels correlated significantly with annual expansion rate (r = 0. 28; P =. 005), persisting after adjustment for initial AAA size, smoking habits, diastolic blood pressure, ankle blood pressure index, and age. After exclusion of 38 cases with MIF levels below the detection limit, initial AAA size was also significantly correlated with the MIF levels (r = 0. 42; P =. 001), persisting after adjustment for similar confounders, and the correlation coefficient with expansion rate increased to 0. 42 (P =. 001). Conclusion: Highly expressed MIF in macrophages, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells in lesions from atherosclerosis and AAA and significant association between serum MIF level and AAA initial size and AAA expansion rate in a group of patients with AAA suggest a potential involvement of this proinflammatory cytokine in the pathogenesis of these cardiovascular diseases.
