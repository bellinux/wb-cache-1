Mr. Perfect recovered {{and used a}} neckbreaker and sleeper hold to wear down the Tornado. <b>As</b> <b>Perfect</b> was showing off for the crowd, the Tornado attacked him from behind.

5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either {{result in a}} contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will. The former are classified <b>as</b> <b>perfect</b> duties, the latter as imperfect. A perfect duty always holds true—there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, so we must never lie. An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect duties are more important than imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} several perfect {{formations}} in Sabellian languages. A key {{feature of the}} Sabellian perfect {{was the use of}} secondary endings, as opposed to the primary endings of the present. Many formations, especially in Oscan, did not contain a specific suffix, but were characterised <b>as</b> <b>perfects</b> through the gemination of the final stem consonant and the proper secondary ending. Other perfects, mainly in Umbrian, involved the present suffix ∗ye/o- and were marked <b>as</b> <b>perfects</b> only through the use of the secondary endings.

5|$|Plantinga argued that, {{although}} the first premise is not rationally established, {{it is not}} contrary to reason. Michael Martin argued that, if certain components of perfection are contradictory, such as omnipotence and omniscience, then the first premise is contrary to reason. Martin also proposed parodies of the argument, suggesting {{that the existence of}} anything can be demonstrated with Plantinga's argument, provided it is defined <b>as</b> <b>perfect</b> or special in every possible world.|$|E

He described that space <b>as</b> <b>perfect</b> for the recording, as there was nothing there to distract him.|$|E

5|$|Heathen deities are {{not seen}} <b>as</b> <b>perfect,</b> omnipotent, and omnipresent, and are instead viewed as having their own {{strengths}} and weaknesses. Many practitioners {{believe that these}} deities will one day die, as did, for instance, the god Baldr in Norse mythology. Heathens view their connection with their deities not as being that of a master and servant but rather as an interdependent relationship akin {{to that of a}} family. For them, these deities serve as both examples and role models whose behavior is to be imitated. Many practitioners believe that they can communicate with these deities, as well as negotiate, bargain, and argue with them, and hope that through venerating them, practitioners will gain wisdom, understanding, power, or visionary insights.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} contest, Ric Flair and Razor Ramon {{wrestled}} against Mr. Perfect and Randy Savage. Ramon and Perfect began the match, but Flair entered after Perfect insulted him. Perfect threw Flair into the corner, and Flair's momentum carried {{him over the}} top rope to the ring apron. Savage attacked Flair and then took Perfect's place in the ring to maintain the advantage over Flair. From outside the ring, Ramon hit Savage with his knee and Flair and Ramon took turns attacking Savage's knee. While Ramon performed a half Boston crab on Savage, Perfect considered leaving the match and abandoning Savage. Savage recovered briefly by trying to pin Flair, but Ramon performed a chokeslam on Savage. Ric Flair attempted to attack Savage from the top rope, but Savage threw him to the ring floor instead. Perfect executed a neckbreaker and an atomic drop on Ramon. Outside of the ring, Flair attacked Savage with a chair. The referee was knocked unconscious, and Perfect tried to pin Ramon by performing a PerfectPlex. Because no referee was available to count the pinfall, a substitute referee came to the ring. The first referee recovered <b>as</b> <b>Perfect</b> attempted to pin Flair with a PerfectPlex. Flair escaped the pin attempt, and he and Ramon attacked Perfect until the referees were unable to keep the match under control. As a result, Ramon and Flair were disqualified, and the victory was awarded to Perfect and Savage.|$|E

25|$|Within the Pagan movement, {{there can}} be found many deities, both male and female, who have various {{associations}} and embody forces of nature, aspects of culture, and facets of human psychology. These deities are typically depicted in human form, and are viewed as having human faults. They are therefore not seen <b>as</b> <b>perfect,</b> but rather are venerated as being wise and powerful. Pagans feel that this understanding of the gods reflected the dynamics of life on Earth, allowing for the expression of humour.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} rise of Marxism, E. Screpanti and S.

Marginalism, Screpanti and Zamagni argue, offered a theory {{of the free market}} <b>as</b> <b>perfect,</b> as performing optimal allocation of resources, while it allowed economists to blame any adverse effects of laissez-faire economics on the interference of workers' coalitions in the proper functioning of the market.|$|E
