Evidence-Based Answer: Probiotics {{are better than}} placebo at inducing remission in patients with ulcerative colitis (SOR: <b>A,</b> <b>based</b> on meta-analysis of RCTs). VSL# 3 (T), a proprietary combination probiotic, {{is more effective than}} placebo for the maintenance of remission of chronic pouchitis (inflammation of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis) (SOR: <b>A,</b> <b>based</b> on systematic review). Saccharomyces boulardii added to triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori increases eradication rates (SOR: <b>A,</b> <b>based</b> on meta-analysis of 5 RCTs).

40|$|Testing for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) finds {{more cases}} of unrecognized {{hypothyroidism}} than history and physical examination (strength of recommendation [SOR]: <b>A,</b> <b>based</b> on cohort studies). Women {{with an initial}} screening TSH > 10 mU/L {{are more likely to}} develop complications of hypothyroidism and to benefit from treatment (SOR: <b>A,</b> <b>based</b> on prospective cohort studies). Treating women who have asymptomatic hypothyroidism and a screening TSH > 10 mU/L prevents progression to symptomatic overt disease (SOR: <b>A,</b> <b>based</b> on prospective cohort studies) and reduces serum lipid levels (SOR: <b>A,</b> <b>based</b> on randomized controlled trials). Treating women who have subclinical hypothyroidism found by screening does not reduce symptoms (SOR: A, small randomized controlled trials), and its effect on cardiac disease remains controversial.
