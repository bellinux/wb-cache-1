50|$|<b>Acedapsone</b> (INN) is an {{antimicrobial}} drug, {{which also}} has antimalarial activity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acedapsone,</b> or 1399 F, is a {{diacetyl}} compound, {{derived from}} dapsone. It was synthesized and developed in 1937 by Ernest Fourneau {{and his team}} in the pharmaceutical chemistry laboratory of Pasteur Institute, and it was marketed as Rodilone by the Rhône-Poulenc company.|$|E
50|$|Dapsone is {{also used}} in the {{treatment}} and prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in AIDS patients who are allergic to or intolerant of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. <b>Acedapsone</b> is a derivative of dapsone that has little activity against M. leprae but is converted to an active dapsone metabolite. It is a long-acting intramuscular repository form of dapsone with a half-life of 46 days. It may prove useful in leprosy patients who cannot tolerate long-term oral dapsone therapy.|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of a {{clinical}} trial of <b>acedapsone</b> therapy in 17 patients with lepromatous leprosy, the rate of response to therapy was measured by inoculation of mice with Mycobacterium leprae recovered from biopsy specimens of skin lesions obtained before treatment and at intervals of 4, 12, and 24 weeks after institution of treatment. The susceptibility of each isolate of M. leprae to dapsone (4, 4 ′-diaminodiphenylsulfone [DDS]) was measured by passaging organisms that had multiplied in mice to new groups of untreated mice and to mice treated with DDS incorporated in the mouse chow in concentrations of 10 − 5, 3 × 10 − 5, and 10 − 4 g/ 100 ml. The rate of response to <b>acedapsone</b> therapy and the susceptibility of patient strains of M. leprae to DDS varied widely among patients. All isolates were inhibited from multiplication by treatment of mice with 10 − 4 g of DDS per 100 ml; all but two isolates were susceptible to 3 × 10 − 5 g of DDS per 100 ml; and 17 of 36 isolates, representing nine patient strains, were susceptible to 10 − 5 g of DDS per 100 ml. Plasma levels of DDS measured in the mice administered these diets show that the minimal inhibitory concentration of DDS for M. leprae isolated from untreated patients is about 3 ng/ml. No relationship could be demonstrated between DDS susceptibility of pretreatment isolates of M. leprae and the rate at which patients responded to <b>acedapsone</b> therapy. Neither <b>acedapsone</b> treatment of patients nor DDS treatment of mice appeared to select genotypically more resistant M. leprae...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{developments}} {{have occurred in}} the application of the method for growing Mycobacterium leprae in the mouse foot-pad since it was first described about 10 years ago. The method has been used to study growth curves and histology in normal and in thymectomized irradiated mice, to identify supposed isolates of Myco. leprae that have been made in tissue-culture or in non-living media, to evaluate tests of experimental vaccines, to investigate applications to clinical investigations (the loss of infectivity during chemotherapy as a means of monitoring a drug trial, the demonstration of drug-resistance, and the clinical problem of the patient who responds poorly to therapy), and to study new drugs—e. g., dapsone, <b>acedapsone,</b> clofazimine, and rifampicin...|$|E
40|$|The {{progressive}} {{spread in}} Asia and South America of falciparum malaria resistant to 4 -aminoquinolines, and the focal occurrence in all malarious regions of infections resistant to dihydrofolate dehydrogenase inhibitors such as pyrimethamine and proguanil, make it everywhere {{necessary to be}} alert {{to the failure of}} accepted curative, prophylactic, or sporontocidal chemotherapeutic agents. Resistance to 4 -aminoquinolines may be met curatively with courses of treatment lasting 1 - 14 days, or more, the longer courses relying on quinine, often with a sulfonamide, or on tetracyclines, and the shorter courses on associations of sulfonamides or sulfones with pyrimethamine or trimethoprim. Suppressive prophylaxis of these infections is obtained by the injection at 3 -month intervals of a repository mixture of <b>acedapsone</b> and cycloguanil, or by the weekly ingestion of sulfadoxine, sulfalene, or diformyl-dapsone associated with pyrimethamine, or the daily ingestion of dapsone with proguanil. Primaquine, although continuing to be an efficient sporontocide of P. falciparum when pyrimethamine and proguanil no longer suffice, is becoming less effective in preventing relapses of P. vivax in countries around New Guinea...|$|E
