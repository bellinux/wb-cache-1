Material structure’s refining during the upsetting produces also the material non-linear hardening. Taking care on the above considerations, the initial assumptions about an important thermal response of 99 % Aluminium during the upsetting process due to the inter-crystalline friction forces (we expected important temperature increasing especially in the contact area – around 200 C) were experimentally unconfirmed by the thermographic analysis of the cold welding process...|$|R

This algorithm – a modified controlled random search using parallel computing – maximised the annual Net Financial Return (NFR) for a tomato grower by selecting the best alternative to fulfil eight design elements: type of greenhouse structure, material of the cover, outdoor shade screen, whitewash properties, thermal screen, heating system, cooling system and CO 2 enrichment system. As an example, the algorithm was applied to two locations with different climatic and economic conditions, Almeria and The Netherlands. Due to the warm climate with high radiation levels in Almeria, a greenhouse with a relatively large specific ventilation area (20 % compared to 14 % for Dutch conditions), seasonal whitewash and a low-capacity direct air heater (50 W m- 2 compared to 200 W m- 2 for Dutch conditions) was selected. In contrast, for the relatively cold climate with low radiation levels of the Netherlands, a 100 % <b>aluminium</b> <b>thermal</b> screen and no whitewash would give the best result. The design method produced realistic greenhouses and related annual NFR, indicating that the method performs well. An analysis of the close-to-best greenhouses showed that, for both locations, a structure with high light transmissivity considerably enhanced the greenhouse performance whereas an outdoor shade screen, geothermal heating and mechanical cooling would be not economical.

40|$|Thermal {{management}} {{materials are}} continuously gaining importance {{as a consequence}} of everlasting evolution in performance of electronic and electric devices. In particular, by improving the heat exchanger’s materials' properties (i. e. thermal conductivity) it is possible to boost further performance and miniaturization of such devices. Due to their high thermal conductivity, Copper and Aluminium are currently the most commonly used materials for thermal management applications. However, the mismatch in thermal expansion between Cooper/Aluminium and Silicon is limiting the heat transfer at the interface between the electronic chip and the heat exchanger. Furthermore, Copper is indeed characterized by a high thermal conductivity {{but at the same time}} its high density (8. 9 g/cm 3) increases weight of the final product, which in most of the cases does not meet specific application requirements. High cost of these materials is another constraint which limits their application. Due to aforementioned facts, monolithic metals used as thermal management materials cannot simultaneously satisfy characteristics of high thermal conductivity, low thermal expansion and low density. As an answer to this demand, an ongoing research is observed to investigate advanced composites as an alternative to conventional monolithic structures. Among variety of compositions, the Aluminium-Graphite reinforced metal matrix composite seems to be a promising solution due to its superior thermal properties and low cost. Several variants of composites are presented in this thesis, starting with a study and simulation of their properties, production process and refinement, finalized with experimental measurements of thermal and mechanical properties of the final compositions.

40|$|The {{density of}} the Al-Li alloy is about 5 % {{less than that of}} the alloy 3. 2384. 6 and about 6 % less than that of pure <b>aluminium.</b> The <b>thermal</b> {{expansion}} behaviour of the Al-Li alloy is practically {{the same as that of}} pure aluminium, whereas the alloy 3. 2384. 6 shows significantly lower coefficients of thermal expansion. Compared to pure aluminium the modulus of elasticity for the Al-Li alloy is raised by about 9 to 12 %. The alloy 3. 2384. 6 also shows an increase of about 6 %. The results, particularly the values of Poisson's ratio, indicate the presence of textures in the materials, which can affect the modulus of elasticity. The differences between the alloy 3. 2384. 6 and pure aluminium with respect to sepcific heat are negligible. In contrast, the Al-Li alloy attains markedly higher values than does pure aluminium. The maxima observed in the specific heat versus temperature curve at about 140 and 245 C must be attributed to changes occurring in the configuration of precipitates. The room temperature electrical resistivity is raised by a factor of 1. 7 for the alloy 3. 2384. 6 and by a factor of 3. 5 for the Al-Li alloy relative to pure aluminium. The maximum in the thermal conductivity versus temperature curve, present at subzero temperatures, is highly pronounced for pure aluminium. It is only weakly evident for the alloy 3. 2384. 6 and moreover shifted to slightly higher temperatures. For the Al-Li alloy, the thermal conductivity increases continuously as the temperature increases.

Cooling curves for the metal were recorded with two thermocouples, one at the centre of the melt volume and one beside the containing crucible wall. A specially designed chamber with kaowool blanket was used to achieve the slowest cooling rate. The faster cooling rate was achieved with the crucible in open atmosphere with a set air flow rate over the crucible. A Data Acquisition (DAQ) system controlled by LabVIEW software was used to record the temperature-time profiles. From these cooling curves, the phase change at any corresponding time and temperature was estimated. The temperature difference between centre and wall of crucible was used to determine dendritic coherency point (DCP). Results show that, the slowest cooling rate with the kaowool blanket was at 0. 03 °C/s.

The objective of this experiment {{presented in this paper}} was to understand the relationship between solidification rate, metallurgical behaviour, and fraction phase growth of wrought aluminium 6061. This information was crucial and important to the foundry industry to understand the material behaviour that will help to cast wrought <b>aluminium</b> 6061. <b>Thermal</b> {{analysis and}} microstructure of wrought aluminium 6061 on different cooling conditions are present in this paper. In this work, Aluminium 6061 heated and melted in a graphite crucible at a temperature of 800 °C. Two thermocouples located at the centre and 20 mm from the graphite crucible wall. Slow cooling rate condition experiment rig was developed by placing graphite crucible into a chamber with kaowool insulation. Normal cooling rate condition was developed by allowing the molten solidify at room temperature. Fast cooling rate condition was prepared by applying a forced airflow over the graphite crucible. The slow, normal, and high cooling rates were calculated at 0. 03 °C/s, 0. 2 °C/s and 0. 3 °C/s respectively. Cooling curve analysis was performed to predict various areas of solidification phase and fraction solid. In Addition, the microstructure formation was observed, recorded, and compared between different cooling conditions. The results show slow cooling rate condition formation of eutectic and solidus temperatures occurred far from liquidus temperature. The eutectic and solidus temperature was increased with the increment of the cooling rate. Furthermore, the DCP temperature of slow cooling rate condition at 638. 3 °C was the lowest while gives wider temperature range corresponding to the fraction solid percentage increment. Meanwhile, an increase in cooling rate refined the microstructure, improved the grain circularity {{and at the same time}} reduced the aspect ratio...|$|R
