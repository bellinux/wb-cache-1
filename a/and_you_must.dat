Both I Will Say Goodbye (Evans' last album for Fantasy Records) <b>and</b> <b>You</b> <b>Must</b> Believe in Spring (for Warner Bros.) highlighted changes that would become significant in the last stage of Evans' life. A greater emphasis was placed on group improvisation and interaction, and new harmonic experiments were attempted.|$|E

Shortly after the recording of the trilogy's first volume began, her brother, playwright Philip-Dimitri Galás, became sick with the disease, which goaded Galás to redouble her efforts. Philip-Dimitri Galás died in 1986, just before {{the completion of the}} trilogy.|$|E

[...] During a radio appearance in San Francisco, Eminem reportedly angered local DJ Sista Tamu due to a freestyle about [...] "slapping a pregnant bitch" [...] {{to the extent that}} she broke a copy of The Slim Shady LP on-air.

2500|$|Even though Stalin was {{preparing}} for a likely war, he still believed that he could at least avoid a short-term clash. [...] In an effort to demonstrate peaceful intentions toward Germany, on April 13, 1941, the Soviets signed a neutrality pact with Axis power Japan. During that signing ceremony, Stalin embraced the German ambassador and exclaimed [...] "we must remain friends <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> do everything to that end!" [...] While Stalin had little faith in Japan's commitment to neutrality, {{he felt that the}} pact was important for its political symbolism, to reinforce a public affection for Germany. Stalin felt that there was a growing split in German circles about whether Germany should initiate a war with the Soviet Union.|$|E

2500|$|Although One Hundred Years of Solitude {{has come}} to be {{considered}} one of, if not the, most influential Latin American texts of all time, the novel and Gabriel García Márquez have both received occasional criticisms. Stylistically, Harold Bloom remarked that [...] "My primary impression, in the act of rereading One Hundred Years of Solitude, is a kind of aesthetic battle fatigue, since every page is rammed full of life beyond the capacity of any single reader to absorb... There are no wasted sentences, no mere transitions, in this novel, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> notice everything at the moment you read it." [...] Additionally, David Haberly alleges that García Márquez may have borrowed themes from several works, such as William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, Virginia Woolf's , Defoe's A Journal of the Plague Year, and Chateaubriand's Atala. This, however, is not necessarily a negative criticism, as it involves the concept of intertextuality.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to return Japan to its feudal, agrarian roots, the Tokugawa regime in 1842 instituted the Tempō Reforms (Tempō no kaikaku - 天保の改革), a {{collection}} of laws governing many aspects of everyday life. In addition to the economy, the military, agriculture and religion, the Reforms reached {{into the world of}} art. The intent of the Reforms was essentially to valorize frugality and loyalty, thus ostentatious or morally dubious images such as depictions of geisha, oiran courtesans and kabuki actors were banned. According to an 1842 decree aimed at print publishers: “To make woodblock prints of Kabuki actors, courtesans and geisha is detrimental to public morals. Henceforth the publication of new works [...] as well as the sale of previously procured stocks is strictly forbidden. In future you are to select designs that are based on loyalty and filial piety and which serve to educate women and children, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> insure that they are not luxurious.” ...|$|E
