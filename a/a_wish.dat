5|$|Allegations {{have been}} made of {{omissions}} in the history described by the film. The absence of discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was noticed by some viewers. Davis claimed that Leo Strauss's ideas had been formed by his experiences in Germany during the Weimar Republic, and alleged that the film's failure to mention this was motivated by <b>a</b> <b>wish</b> to portray Strauss as concerned with American suburban culture, like Qutb.|$|E

After taking possession of her father (Mitch Pileggi), he kills her mother and stabs himself to kill his host. Mary's fiance, John Winchester, is the demon's next victim.

5|$|I do not, and I have {{no doubt}} your Lordships do not, have any wish to expand {{the role of the}} {{judiciary}} at the expense of any other organ of the State or to seek to frustrate the properly expressed wish of Parliament as contained in legislation. The attribution in certain quarters of such <b>a</b> <b>wish</b> to the judiciary is misconceived and appears to be the product of lack of understanding of the judicial function and the sources of law which the courts are bound to apply.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939, as {{with most}} other aspects of A/S, no clear plan existed for the {{armament}} of Coastal Command's aircraft. While operational control {{was given to the}} Admiralty, the faith of both services in ASDIC proved ill-founded. It ruled out the submarine threat, and caused a refocusing on surface attacks. In addition, no A/S weapons had been developed properly in the inter-war period. Most of the munitions were left over from the First World War, due in part to <b>a</b> <b>wish</b> to economise and the fact no order had been given to dispose of them.|$|E

Link fights Vaati {{just before}} he can drain Zelda {{of all of the}} Light Force hidden within her. Link defeats Vaati after {{engaging}} in a fight that consists of Vaati changing forms.
