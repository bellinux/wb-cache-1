40|$|The {{degradation}} of asparagine to acrylamide produced by 2, 4 -decadienals was analysed {{in detail in}} an attempt to understand the reactions pathways involved in the formation of acrylamide by oxidised lipids. Thus, the effects of aw, pH, oxygen and lipid content, and time and temperature, were studied in different samples of 2, 4 -decadienal, 2, 4 -heptadienal, 2, 4 -hexadienal, 2 -octenal, or ethyl 2, 4 -decadienoate with asparagine, N-acetylasparagine, asparagine t-butyl ester, glutamine or ammonium chloride. Acrylamide was produced to a higher extent in alkadienal/asparagine mixtures, and the reaction yield increased slightly when the chain length of the oxidised lipid decreased. In addition, the reaction yield was very much reduced when the amino acid was esterified or when an alkenal was employed. Furthermore, acrylamide was not produced when ethyl 2, 4 -decadienoate, N-acetylasparagine, glutamine or ammonium chloride were employed. These results, together with the detection of 3 -aminopropionamide and 2 -pentylpyridine in 2, 4 -decadienal/asparagine mixtures, suggested a potential role of the <b>alkadienal</b> in both the decarboxylation of the amino acid and the later conversion of decarboxylated amino acid into acrylamide. This last conclusion was confirmed by studying the effect of the lipid content in the formation of acrylamide in 2, 4 -decadienal/ 3 -aminopropionamide mixtures.

40|$|The {{decarboxylation}} of asparagine in {{the presence}} of alkanals, alkenals, and <b>alkadienals,</b> among other lipid derivatives, was studied in an attempt to understand the reaction pathways by which some lipid oxidation products are able to convert asparagine into acrylamide. Asparagine was converted into 3 -aminopropionamide {{in the presence}} of lipid derivatives as a function of reaction conditions (pH, water content, time, and temperature), as well as the type and amount of lipid compound involved. <b>Alkadienals</b> (and analogous ketodienes) were the most reactive lipids followed by hydroperoxides and alkenals. Saturated carbonyls and polyunsaturated fatty acids, or other polyunsaturated derivatives, also exhibited some reactivity. On the other hand, saturated lipids or monounsaturated alcohols did not degrade asparagine. A mechanism for the decarboxylation of asparagine {{in the presence of}} <b>alkadienals</b> based on the deuteration results obtained when asparagine/ 2, 4 -decadienal model systems were heated in the presence of deuterated water was proposed. The activation energy (Ea) of asparagine decarboxylation by 2, 4 -decadienal was 81. 0 kJ/mol, which is higher than that found for the conversion of 3 -aminopropionamide into acrylamide in the presence of 2, 4 -decadienal. This result points to the decarboxylation step as the key step in the conversion of asparagine into acrylamide in the presence of <b>alkadienals.</b> Therefore, any inhibiting strategy for suppressing the formation of acrylamide by <b>alkadienals</b> should be mainly directed to the inhibition of this step. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

40|$|Straight chain, {{saturated}} and unsarurated, aldehydes {{are important}} constituents of citrus fruit, dairy, vegetable, meat and other flavours. For instance, alkanals and 2 -alkenals (C 6 to C 14) {{have been detected}} and quantified in Bitter Orange Oil. The organoleptic qualities and threshold values of these compounds are quite different; moreover, the qualities change a lot on dilution. An attempt {{has been made to}} correlate the physicochemical parameters with the organoleptic properties of alkanals, alkenals and <b>alkadienals</b> from C 6 to C 14. The studied physicochemical parameters are molecular weight, vapour pressure, melting point, molecular refraction, partition coëfficient and dipole moment: the structural features have also been studied. Organoleptic qualities (of concentrated and diluted stimulants) and threshold values have been investigated. Structure-activity relationships have been found for the flavour components, alkanals. alkenals and <b>alkadienals,</b> with isolated and conjugated double bonds. The organoleptic qualities include penetrating-pungent, green herbal, rosefatty, citrusy, and others. An explanation is advanced of the effects of length of carbon chain, place of double bond(s), isolated and conjugated, and Z and E geometrical isomers, on organoleptic quality and threshold values...|$|R
40|$|Special Issue: Special: The Maillard Reaction in Food and Medicine Current Status and Future AspectsCarbonyl {{compounds}} {{have been}} shown {{to play a major role}} in the conversion of asparagine into acrylamide. However, it is unclear at this point if its role is only restricted to the decarboxylation of the amino acid or if carbonyl compounds also play a role in the deamination reaction of the decarboxylated intermediates 3 -aminopropionamide and 3 -(alkylamino) propionamides. This study describes the deamination reaction of 3 -aminopropionamide and 3 -(alkylamino) propionamides (benzyl, phenylethyl, butyl, and octyl) in model systems and in the presence, or not, of different carbonyl compounds (<b>alkadienals,</b> alkenals, and alkanals). All these reactions were mainly produced at almost neutral or basic pH values. In addition, the reaction yields and the activation energies not only depended on the type of aminopropionamide involved but also on the water activity (aw) and in the presence, or not, of carbonyl compounds. However, there was not a clear correlation among the activation energies calculated for the different deamination reactions and the yields of acrylamide obtained; therefore, suggesting the existence of diverse pathways by which 3 -aminopropionamide and 3 -(alkylamino) propionamides are converted into acrylamide. In addition, these reactions are also competing with other carbonyl–amine reactions when carbonyl compounds are present. All these results suggest that the type of the intermediate aminopropionamide involved is going to play a major role in both the amount of acrylamide produced and the conditions required for its formation. On the other hand, the role of carbonyl compounds in the acrylamide produced, but not in the activation energy of the reactions implicated, seems to be more limited than either the type of amine or the aw. A detailed analysis of the type of the intermediate aminopropionamide formed in foods may help to define strategies for mitigating the formation of this food toxicant.
