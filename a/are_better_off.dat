25|$|A hybrid form of {{coordination}} and anti-coordination is the discoordination game, where one player's incentive is to coordinate {{while the other}} player tries to avoid this. Discoordination games have no pure Nash equilibria. In Figure 1, choosing payoffs so that Anbsp&>nbsp&B, Cnbsp&<nbsp&D, while anbsp&<nbsp&b, cnbsp&>nbsp&d, creates a discoordination game. In {{each of the four}} possible states either player 1 or player 2 <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> by switching their strategy, so the only Nash equilirium is mixed. The canonical example of a discoordination game is the matching pennies game.|$|E

25|$|Transgender youth {{experience}} {{a wide range}} of abuse and lack of understanding from the people in their environment and <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> with a high resilience to deal with their lives. A study was done looking at 55 transgender youths studying their sense of personal mastery, perceived social support, emotion-oriented coping and self-esteem. It was seen that around 50% of the variation in the resilience aspects accounted for the problematic issues of the teens. This means that transgender youths with lower resilience were more prone to mental health issues, including depression and trauma symptoms. Emotion-oriented coping was a strong aspect of resilience in determining how depressed the individuals were.|$|E

25|$|Self-enhancement {{suggests}} that optimistic predictions are satisfying {{and that it}} feels good to think that positive events will happen. People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions if they believe they <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> than others. People tend to focus on finding information that supports what they want to see happen, rather than what will happen to them. With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, because that is what they would like the outcome to be. This also {{suggests that}} people might lower their risks compared to others to make themselves look better than average: they are less at risk than others and therefore better.|$|E

This makes him abusive and neglectful towards Kathy and Ben, so Kathy takes Ben and moves out.

At the 2007 NRJ Music Awards, The Open Door received a nomination for Best International Album of the Year, and the album won Album of the Year at the 2007 MTV Australia Video Music Awards.
