5|$|Their {{effects are}} far-reaching; by {{increasing}} the amount of respiration in the oceans, viruses are indirectly responsible for reducing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide in the atmosphere by approximately 3 gigatonnes of carbon per year.|$|E
5|$|In 1722, René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur {{demonstrated}} that iron {{was transformed into}} steel through the absorption of some substance, now known to be carbon. In 1772, Antoine Lavoisier showed that diamonds are a form of carbon; when he burned samples of charcoal and diamond and found that neither produced any water and that both released the same <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide per gram.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that the solid earth as a whole contains 730 ppm of carbon, with 2000 ppm in the core and 120 ppm in the combined mantle and crust. Since the mass of the earth is , this would imply 4360 million gigatonnes of carbon. This is much more than the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> in the oceans or atmosphere (below).|$|E

5|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Venus {{is composed of}} 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen, and traces of other gases, most notably sulfur dioxide. The amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere is relatively small compared to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide, but because the atmosphere is so much thicker than that on Earth, its total nitrogen content is roughly four times higher than Earth's, even though on Earth nitrogen makes up about 78% of the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of dissolved oxygen in Fishing Creek ranges from approximately 5 to 17.5mg/L at Benton. A site near Camp Lavigne had slightly less variability, ranging from 8 to 17mg/L. The concentration near Bloomsburg ranged between 4.1 and 17.1mg/L, {{with an average}} of 10.9mg/L. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide near Bloomsburg ranged from 0.3 to 34mg/L, {{with an average of}} 2.04mg/L.|$|E
5|$|Narcosis {{has been}} {{compared}} with altitude sickness regarding its variability of onset (though not its symptoms); its effects depend on many factors, with variations between individuals. Thermal cold, stress, heavy work, fatigue, and carbon dioxide retention all increase the risk and severity of narcosis. Carbon dioxide has a high narcotic potential and also causes increased {{blood flow to the}} brain, increasing the effects of other gases. Increased risk of narcosis results from increasing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide retained through heavy exercise, shallow or skip breathing, or because of poor gas exchange in the lungs.|$|E

5|$|Oceans {{contain the}} {{greatest}} quantity of actively-cycled carbon {{in the world}} and are second only to the lithosphere in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> they store. The oceans' surface layer holds large amounts of dissolved organic carbon that is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere. The deep layer's concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon is about 15 percent higher than that of the surface layer and it remains there for much longer periods of time. Thermohaline circulation exchanges carbon between these two layers.|$|E
5|$|The {{peculiar}} {{geometry of}} the Uranian system causes the moons' poles to receive more solar energy than their equatorial regions. Because the vapor pressure of CO2 is a steep function of temperature, this {{may lead to the}} accumulation of carbon dioxide in the low-latitude regions of Titania, where it can stably exist on high albedo patches and shaded regions of the surface in the form of ice. During the summer, when the polar temperatures reach as high as 85–90 K, carbon dioxide sublimates and migrates to the opposite pole and to the equatorial regions, giving rise to a type of carbon cycle. The accumulated carbon dioxide ice can be removed from cold traps by magnetospheric particles, which sputter it from the surface. Titania is thought to have lost a significant <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide since its formation 4.6 billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|Under {{terrestrial}} conditions, {{conversion of}} one element to another is very rare. Therefore, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> on Earth is effectively constant. Thus, processes that use carbon must obtain it from somewhere {{and dispose of}} it somewhere else. The paths of carbon in the environment form the carbon cycle. For example, photosynthetic plants draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (or seawater) and build it into biomass, as in the Calvin cycle, a process of carbon fixation. Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, while some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide. The carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop; for example, some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans; if bacteria do not consume it, dead plant or animal matter may become petroleum or coal, which releases carbon when burned.|$|E

5|$|While {{operating}} in all-electric mode the Volt produces no tailpipe emissions. In this mode {{there is an}} absence of harmful chemical emissions that can negatively impact air quality, allowing for a continuous clean air benefit. There is also a lack of carbon dioxide emissions. However, this benefit is mostly local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, these emissions are shifted to the location of the electricity generation plants. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide emitted depends on the emission intensity of the power source used to charge the vehicle. When the Volt's battery is depleted and the gasoline-powered engine engages, the plug-in emissions are similar to other internal combustion engine vehicles. The amount of total local emissions depends on how much the Volt is driven in all-electric mode and how much in charge-sustaining mode.|$|E

50|$|Large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> are {{exchanged}} {{each year}} between {{the ocean and}} the atmosphere. A major controlling factor in oceanic-atmospheric carbon exchange is thermohaline circulation. In regions <b>of</b> ocean upwelling, <b>carbon</b> rich water from the deep ocean comes {{to the surface and}} releases carbon into the atmosphere as <b>carbon</b> dioxide. Large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide are dissolved in cold water in higher latitudes. This water sinks down and brings the carbon into the deeper ocean levels, where it can stay for anywhere between decades and several centuries. Ocean circulation events cause this process to be variable. For example, during El Nino events there is less deep ocean upwelling, leading to lower outgasing <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide into the atmosphere.|$|R

2500|$|Humans also {{influence}} the carbon cycle indirectly {{by changing the}} terrestrial and oceanic biosphere [...] Over the past several centuries, direct and indirect human-caused land use and land cover change (LUCC) {{has led to the}} loss of biodiversity, which lowers ecosystems' resilience to environmental stresses and decreases their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. More directly, it often leads to the release <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> from terrestrial ecosystems into the atmosphere. Deforestation for agricultural purposes removes forests, which hold large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon,</b> and replaces them, generally with agricultural or urban areas. Both of these replacement land cover types store comparatively small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon,</b> so that the net product of the process is that more carbon stays in the atmosphere.|$|R
