He signed the Health Choices Plan in 2007 to provide San Francisco residents with universal healthcare. In 2004, Newsom gained national attention when he directed the San Francisco city–county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, {{in violation of}} the state law passed in 2000.|$|E
5|$|San Esteban {{was one of}} a {{flotilla}} of four ships carrying treasure from New Spain (Mexico) to Cuba. Three were wrecked in the storm, including San Esteban. Many of {{the three}} hundred sailors and passengers drowned while trying to reach shore. About thirty took a boat to seek help. Almost all the others died of thirst or starvation, or were killed by hostile local Karankawa Indians during their attempt to walk back to safety. The Spanish sent a salvage expedition, but recovered {{less than half of the}} cargo <b>and</b> <b>treasure.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} {{contribution of}} the Morea scientific expedition was in effect its quasi-disinterest in pillage <b>and</b> <b>treasure</b> hunting. Blouet refused to perform excavations that risked damaging the monuments, and banned the mutilation of statues {{with the intent of}} taking a piece separated {{from the rest of the}} statue without regard. It is perhaps for this reason that the three metopes of the temple of Zeus discovered at Olympia were brought back in their entirety. In any case, this willingness to protect the integrity of monuments undoubtedly represented an epistemological progress.|$|E

5|$|Following this, a gift {{made by the}} Grand Prince to Davyd Igorevich, which {{included}} land in Volhynia and control of trade with the Byzantine Empire, {{is said to have}} made Yaropolk hostile to the Grand Prince. By 1085 Vsevolod and Yaropolk are reported to have become entrenched against each other, and Vsevolod ordered his son, Vladimir Monomakh to march against Yaropolk. Lacking confidence in his own resources, Yaropolk fled Volhynia to Poland, leaving his followers (and mother) at Lutsk. Vladimir captured Lutsk and Yaropolk's family, attendants <b>and</b> <b>treasure,</b> and assigned his whole principality to Davyd Igorevich.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to combat, {{there is also}} a mild role-playing component. An experience point system levels up the player character and their equipment (weapons, armor, shields, helms, and magic rings). Equipment pieces have special properties and a predetermined amount of experience points required to master them. Mastering a piece of equipment increases its sale value but decreases the player's experience gain by 20%. Upon leveling up or mastering a piece of equipment, players gain attribute points that can be allotted towards four character attributes: health, attack, shield power, or magic. Each point can only be allocated once and is a permanent upgrade to the character. Players can purchase new equipment using in-game money from sacks <b>and</b> <b>treasure</b> chests found throughout the castle, defeated enemies, and sales of unused equipment. In-game money can be purchased with real money within the game.|$|E
5|$|Marisa Chase appears only in Uncharted: Golden Abyss. She is the {{granddaughter of}} an {{archeologist}} Vincent Perez. She carries a golden amulet, {{which was very}} important to her grandfather. She lived her youth with her grand father because her parents were shot when she was very young. She, just like Nate, got her climbing, knowledge of ancient artifacts <b>and</b> <b>treasure</b> hunting skills at age of 15. She has a problem trusting people who she doesn't know. When she calls someone her partner, that means that she trusts them. Her biggest difference to Elena is that she never uses a gun, even when she is getting shot at. She survived an RPG shot from Roberto Guerro during the events of the game. She finally decides to use a gun {{near the end of the}} game. She is voiced by Christine Lakin.|$|E

5|$|Roguelike games create random tile-based levels, monster encounters, <b>and</b> <b>treasure</b> through {{procedural}} generation on {{each new}} game. Preferably roguelikes {{adhering to the}} Berlin Interpretation use ASCII-based graphics. They may include pre-determined levels as well, such as a town level common to the Moria family where the player can buy and sell equipment. Generated layouts typically incorporate rooms connected by corridors, {{some of which may}} be preset to some degree (e.g., monster lairs or treasuries). Open areas or natural features, such as rivers, may occur, though these are considered against the Berlin Interpretation. While early roguelikes would have levels confined to the bounds of the terminal screen, other roguelikes enabled a much larger level size, only a portion shown to the player as they moved around it.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} of the powerful confederation of the Hun tribes included about 400 AD the lands of southern Poland, where burial <b>and</b> <b>treasure</b> sites have been investigated. A woman's grave in Jędrzychowice, Strzelin County contained fancy feminine ornaments and a nicely preserved bronze kettle, which gave a name ("Jędrzychowice") {{to one of the}} two basic Hun kettle types, while a burial of a young warrior-aristocrat including his horse and precious harness, attire and weaponry elements (gold sheet covered ritual bow and sword sheath) was found in Jakuszowice, Kazimierza Wielka County. Still further east, in Świlcza near Rzeszów a hidden Hun treasure was located; this last find dates from the mid-5th century, when the Hun empire was about to crumble.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the last}} European war of the old style, in which armies maneuvered sedately at a {{distance}} while diplomats hustled between capitals to resolve their Majesties' differences. Given the length of time—six months—the cost in life <b>and</b> <b>treasure</b> was high. In light of the scale of warfare experienced in Europe less than a generation later in the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars, though, this six-month engagement seems mild. Yet while historians often dismissed it {{as the last of}} the archaic mode of Ancien Régime warfare, elements of the war foreshadowed conflicts to come: the sheer sizes of the armies deployed reflected emerging abilities and willingness to conscript, train, equip and field larger armies than had been done in previous generations.|$|E

5|$|In 1595, Sigismund Báthory staged an {{elaborate}} plot and had Aaron the Tyrant, voivode of Moldavia, removed from power. István Jósika (Báthory's chancellor and an ethnic Romanian) masterminded the operation. Ștefan Răzvan arrested Aron {{on charges of}} treason {{on the night of}} 24 April (5 May) and sent him to the Transylvanian capital at Alba Iulia (Gyulafehérvár) with his family <b>and</b> <b>treasure.</b> Aron would die poisoned by the end of May in the castle of Vinc. Sigismund was forced to justify his actions before the European powers, since Aron had played {{an active role in the}} anti-Ottoman coalition. Later on, in the same city of Alba Iulia, Wallachian boyars signed a treaty with Sigismund on Michael's behalf. From the point of view of Wallachian internal politics, the Treaty of Alba Iulia officialized what could be called a boyar regime, reinforcing the already important political power of the noble elite. According to the treaty, a council of 12 great boyars was to take part alongside the voivode in the executive rule of the country.|$|E
5|$|Organic finds {{are rarely}} well {{documented}} with hoards, because most coin <b>and</b> <b>treasure</b> finds are removed hastily by the finder or have previously been disrupted by farm work rather than excavated. The Hoxne organic finds included bone, wood and other plant material, and leather. Small fragments from a decorated ivory pyxis (a cylindrical lidded box) were found, {{along with more}} than 150 tiny shaped pieces of bone inlay or veneer, probably from a wooden box or boxes that have decayed. Minuscule fragments of wood adhering to metal objects were identified as belonging to nine species of timber, all native to Britain: wood traces associated with the iron fittings of the outer chest established that {{it was made of}} oak. Silver locks and hinges were from two small wooden boxes or caskets, one made of decorative cherry wood and one made of yew. Some wheat straw survived from padding between the plain silver bowls, which also bore faint traces of linen cloth. Leather fragments were too degraded for identification.|$|E
5|$|Random dungeons {{were created}} for each {{floor of the}} dungeon by {{selecting}} ten to twenty rooms from a pre-built library of 200 layouts, adding in the monsters, items, and other features, and then including fixed rooms that would be found on each floor, such as a boss room <b>and</b> <b>treasure</b> room. In expanding the gameplay, McMillen used the structure of Zeldas dungeons to design how the player would progress through the game. In a typical Zelda dungeon, according to McMillen, the player acquires a new item that helps them to progress farther in the game; he took the same inspiration to assure that each level in Isaac included at least one item and one bonus item on defeating the boss that would boost the character's attributes. McMillen also wanted to encourage players to experiment to learn how things work within Isaac, mirroring how Miyamoto had done with the original Zelda game. He designed the level progression to become more difficult with the player's progression in the game, as well as additional content that became available after beating the game as to make it feel like the game was long. McMillen designed four of the selectable characters based on the main classes of Dungeons & Dragons—fighter, thief, cleric and wizard.|$|E

5|$|The player {{generally}} has {{to explore the}} dungeon to reveal its contents similar to a fog of war. Many roguelikes include factors related to light sources such as a torch to provide illumination to see monsters in nearby squares, and line of sight can also limit what monsters are visible. Dungeons tend to be connected by stairs; lower dungeon levels generally are more difficult than higher ones, so that a character that is underdeveloped may have difficulty by progressing too fast. Dungeon levels and the population of monsters <b>and</b> <b>treasure</b> within them are generated randomly using procedural generation, so that no game is the same on subsequent playthroughs. Most roguelikes have an ultimate goal of either claiming an item located at the deepest level of the dungeon, or to defeat a specific monster that lives on that level. Typical roguelikes include a scoreboard, ranking the player's performance once their game is over (be it through permadeath or completing the objective) based {{on the amount of}} treasure, money, and experience earned, and how fast the player completed the game in such cases.|$|E
