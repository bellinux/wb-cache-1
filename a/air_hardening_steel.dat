40|$|In {{this work}} a {{material}} model for hardening development in sheet metals during forming processes involving loading path changes is formulated. In particular, such hardening development {{is due to}} the formation and interaction of dislocation microstructures in the material, resulting in an evolution in the size, center and shape of the yield surface. Such yield surface evolution is accounted for in the current model {{with the help of an}} evolving structure tensor. The model is intended for an <b>air</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> and takes therefore thermomechanics into account in particular phase transformations from ferrite to austenite and from austenite to martensite.

40|$|This study {{studied the}} phase transformations {{occurring}} at different continuous cooling rates in an <b>air</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> {{used in the}} rock-crushing industry. Samples of this steel were submitted for calorimetric testing using the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique. In the experimental run, the samples were heated {{at the rate of}} 0. 33 C/s from 50 to 1050 C and equilibrated at this temperature for 900 s, then cooled at seven different cooling rates between 0. 05 and 0. 5 C/s. For all the cooling rates, the DSC traces of the samples showed a first exothermic peak at about 500 C and for samples cooled at rates higher than 0. 15 C/s, a second exothermic peak at about 295 C was observed. From the microstructural investigations carried out by light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), it was observed that all the samples after DSC treatment were characterized by the presence of bainite. In the samples cooled at rates higher than 0. 15 C/s, martensite was also detected. Comparing the results of DSC and SEM, it was concluded that the first peak at 500 C corresponds to the austenite - bainite transformation, while the second peak at 295 C corresponds to the austenite - martensite transformation. The experimentally determined bainite and martensite start temperatures were compared to the values derived from a number of well-known empirical equations...|$|E

50|$|W-group {{tool steel}} gets {{its name from}} its {{defining}} property of having to be water quenched. W-grade steel is essentially high carbon plain-carbon steel. This group of tool steel is {{the most commonly used}} tool steel because of its low cost compared to others. They work well for small parts and applications where high temperatures are not encountered; above 150 C it begins to soften to a noticeable degree. Its hardenability is low, so W-group tool steels must be subjected to a rapid quenching, requiring the use of water. These steels can attain high hardness (above HRC 66) and are rather brittle compared to other tool steels. W-steels are still sold, especially for springs, but are much less widely used {{than they were in the}} 19th and early 20th centuries. This is partly because W-steels warp and crack much more during quench than oil-quenched or <b>air</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steels.</b>|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the research was to enhance steel and aluminum manufacturing {{with the development of}} a new plasma RPD device. During the project (1) plasma devices were manufactured (2) testing for the two metals were carried out and (3) market development strategies were explored. Bayzi Corporation has invented a Rapid Plasma Device (RPD) which produces plasma, comprising of a mixture of ionized gas and free electrons. The ions, when they hit a conducting surface, deposit heat in addition to the convective heat. Two generic models called the RPD-Al and RPD-S have been developed for the aluminum market and the steel market. Aluminum melting rates increased to as high as 12. 7 g/s compared to 3 g/s of the current industrial practice. The RPD melting furnace operated at higher energy efficiency of 65 % unlike most industrial processes operating in the range of 13 to 50 %. The RPD aluminum melting furnace produced environment friendly cleaner melts with less than 1 % dross. Dross is the residue in the furnace after the melt is poured out. Cast ingots were extremely clean and shining. Current practices produce dross in the range of 3 to 12 %. The RPD furnace uses very low power ~ 0. 2 kWh/Lb to melt aluminum. RPDs operate in one atmosphere using ambient air to produce plasma while the conventional systems use expensive gases like argon, or helium in air-tight chambers. RPDs are easy to operate and do not need intensive capital investment. Narrow beam, as well as wide area plasma have been developed for different applications. An RPD was developed for thermal treatments of steels. Two different applications have been pursued. Industrial <b>air</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> knife edges were subjected to plasma beam hardening. Hardness, as measured, indicated uniform distribution without any distortion. The biggest advantage with this method is that the whole part need not be heated in a furnace which will lead to oxidation and distortion. No conventional process will offer localized hardening. The RPD has a great potential for heat treating surgical knives and tools. Unavailability of the full amount of the DOE award prevented further development of this exciting technology. Significant progress was made during the 5 th quarter, specially the invention of the wider-area plasma and the resultant benefits in terms of rapid melting of aluminum and thermal treatments of larger size steel parts. Coating of nickel base superalloys was demonstrated (an additional task over that proposed). Directed low cost surface enhancement of steel and the directed clean low dross energy efficient melting of aluminum are industrial needs that require new technologies. These are large volume markets which can benefit from energy savings. Estimated energy savings are very large, in the order of 1015 J/year when the equipment is universally used. Compact and directed heating technology/product market in these two sectors could potentially reach over $ 1 B in sales. The results of the research, presented at the DOE annual Review meeting on Aluminum held at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory during the 4 - 5 October 2005, were very well received by the delegates and panel reviewers. Insufficient DOE funds to fully fund the project at the end of the 5 th quarter necessitated some key tasks being only partially completed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In turning <b>hardened</b> <b>steel,</b> {{polycrystalline}} cubic {{boron nitride}} (cBN) compacts are widely used, {{due to their}} higher hardness and higher thermal conductivity. However, in milling <b>hardened</b> <b>steel,</b> fracture of cBN cutting tools readily occurs because they have poor fracture toughness. Therefore, coated cemented carbide tools, which have good fracture toughness and wear resistance, are generally widely used. In this study, <b>hardened</b> <b>steel</b> (ASTM D 2, JIS SKD 11, 60 HRC) was milled with three physical vapor deposition (PVD) -coated cemented carbide end mill cutters {{in order to determine}} effective tool materials for cutting <b>hardened</b> <b>steel</b> at high cutting speeds. The coating films used were (Ti,W) N/(Ti,W,Si) N and (Ti,W) N/(Ti,W,Si,Al) N coating films. (Ti,W,Si,Al) N is a new type of coating film. The inner layer of the (Ti,W) N/(Ti,W,Si) N and (Ti,W) N/(Ti,W,Si,Al) N coating system is (Ti,W) N coating film, and the outer layer is (Ti,W,Si) N and (Ti,W,Si,Al) N coating films, respectively. Furthermore, commercial (Ti,Al) N-based coating film was also used. The following results were obtained: (1) In milling <b>hardened</b> <b>steel</b> at a cutting speed of 3. 33 m/s, the tool wear width of the (Ti,W) N/(Ti,W,Si,Al) N-coated tool was smaller than that of the (Ti,W) N/(Ti,W,Si) N-coated tool. And, compared with the commercial (Ti,Al) N, the tool wear width of the (Ti,W) N/(Ti,W,Si,Al) N-coated tool was smaller than that of the (Ti,Al) N-coated tool. (2) The tool wear of the (Ti,W) N/(Ti,W,Si,Al) N-coated tool increased with an increase in cutting speed. (3) The (Ti,W) N/(Ti,W,Si,Al) N-coated cemented carbide was an effective tool material for high-speed cutting below a cutting speed of 3. 33 m/s.
