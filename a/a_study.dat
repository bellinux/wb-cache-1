After <b>studying</b> <b>a</b> Web-based presentation on ‘Global Warming’, subject’s performance was evaluated regarding surface, deep and total learning, satisfaction and navigation style. Results show that, first, subjects with <b>a</b> disorganized <b>study</b> orientation score lower on deep learning and on total learning than subjects with <b>a</b> reproduction <b>study</b> orientation and, second, subjects with <b>a</b> disorganized <b>study</b> orientation felt easier to navigate in the Web-system than subjects with <b>a</b> meaning <b>study</b> orientation (although they visit more pages and spend less time in each one than subjects with <b>a</b> meaning <b>study</b> orientation) ...|$|R

A set of questions addressed to respondents and a set of ways these questions are used by interviewers in interviews — are considered to constitute the subject of <b>a</b> pilot <b>study.</b> <b>As</b> special problems of <b>a</b> pilot <b>study</b> have been accepted those relating to the correctness of questions addressed to respondents {{as well as of the}} ways these questions are used in an interview. On this basis <b>a</b> pilot <b>study</b> is distinguished from other preparatory <b>studies</b> such as <b>a</b> „reconnaissance” <b>study</b> and <b>a</b> „trial” <b>study.</b> Construed in this way the meaning of the term „pilot study” would be closest to the concept of pretest.
