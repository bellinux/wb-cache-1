2500|$|The best {{alternative}} to a negotiated agreement, or BATNA is the alternative option a negotiator holds should the current negotiation fails and does not reach agreement. [...] The quality of a BATNA {{has the potential to}} improve a party's negotiation outcome. Understanding one's BATNA can empower an individual and allow him or her to set higher goals when moving forward. One of the best strategy while going into a negotiation is to ensure that you have a strong BATNA, and if not, have tools equipped that can help you made the other side's BATNA weak. One of the major mistakes made by new negotiators is to disclose their BATNA at first without having had any discussion with the other side. This can jeopardise your position in the negotiation, as your negotiation might have been weaker than the other sides, and such disclosure puts you at a weaker spot in the negotiation. The best strategy is to <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> to develop, if not an exact, but a guess about the other sides BATNA to know your position in the negotiation.|$|E

5000|$|The Solomon Amendment denies {{federal funding}} to any {{university}} with a [...] "policy or practice" [...] that prevents the military from [...] "maintaining, establishing or operating" [...] ROTC on its campus. Such universities {{are allowed to}} require that ROTC adhere to the same policies as the university's other academic programs. According to Diane Mazur of the Palm Center, the military has withdrawn ROTC {{from a number of}} universities rather than adapt to those policies or accept extracurricular status. In her analysis, both the military and academe, as of the fall of 2010, preferred not to dispute the public perception that elite universities had banned ROTC programs. She wrote: The military may be more comfortable when it retreats to parts of the country ... where universities don't <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> .... Colleges may also be more comfortable when they go along with the fiction of banning ROTC, because then they don't have to answer to people upset about [...] "don't ask, don't tell." [...] Everyone buys into the myth, but at the expense of military readiness. The military needs to return to the colleges it walked away from, and everyone needs to stop pretending that ROTC programs ended because of a ban. Others argue that universities effectively ban ROTC by erecting procedural hurdles motivated by anti-military sentiment and objections to discrimination based on sexual orientation that only serve to [...] "discourage their own presumably egalitarian, intelligent, and enlightened students from joining." ...|$|E
