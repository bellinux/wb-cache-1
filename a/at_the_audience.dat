25|$|In 1806, the {{pantomime}} clown Joseph Grimaldi (The Garrick of Clowns) {{had performed}} his greatest success in Harlequin and Mother Goose; or the Golden Egg at Covent Garden, {{and this was}} subsequently revived, at the new theatre.

25|$|William Ball's 1976 American Conservatory Theater production, {{starring}} Fredi Olster and Marc Singer. This celebrated {{production was}} grounded {{very much in}} commedia dell'arte, with acrobats, clowns, pantomime-style violence, over-the-top posturing (Petruchio is depicted shirtless for almost the entire performance), much highly choreographed physicality {{on the part of}} the two leads, and an on-stage audience of clowns who provided on-going sound-effects, such as drums for punches and whistles for people fainting. This production dropped Sly altogether. Katherina's final speech is delivered in an ironic manner, with Olster winking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> before grabbing a confused Petruchio and kissing him passionately. The production was broadcast by PBS in 1976 as part of their Great Performances series, with the TV presentation directed by Kirk Browning.|$|E

[...] The Daily News David Hinckley shared Goldman's concerns about resetting the characters, and while he believed that doing so was the right long-term move, he commented that: [...] "the immediate effect {{is to make the}} episode feel a little jerky."

500|$|Critics {{generally}} {{praised the}} song in Glee first step at original music, including its production, lyrics, and the vocals of Lea Michele. However, common criticisms were that the song sounded like a cover of another song, {{and that it would}} have been better suited for other artists Martin usually works with, such as Pink or Avril Lavigne. The song debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100 and became the cast's third top-ten hit to date. It reached number thirty-six on the US Adult Pop Songs chart, becoming their first song other than a Christmas song to appear on an airplay chart. Internationally, it reached the top thirty in at least five other markets. The song's performance was featured in the Glee episode [...] "Original Song" [...] which first aired on March15,2011, and included choreography and the group throwing confetti from slushie cups <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> The song was redone by Jenna Ushkowitz, Kevin McHale, Darren Criss and Chord Overstreet in the second part of Glee two-part 100th episode, [...] "New Directions", which aired on March 25, 2014.|$|E
500|$|After {{developing}} {{a name for}} himself as a female impersonator known for [...] "trashy" [...] behavior in his early John Waters films, Divine capitalized on this image by appearing at his musical performances in his drag persona.

[...] Divine described his stage performances as [...] "just good, dirty fun, and if you find it offensive, honey, don't join in." [...] As a part of his performance, he constantly swore <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> often using his signature line of [...] "fuck you very much", and at times got audience members to come onstage, where he would fondle their buttocks, groins, and breasts. Divine and his stage act proved particularly popular among gay audiences, and he appeared at some of the world's biggest gay clubs, such as Central London's Heaven. According to Divine's manager Bernard Jay, this was not because Divine himself was gay, but because the gay community [...] "openly and proudly identified with the determination of the female character Divine".|$|E

[...] It also placed the same rank on the list by MTV, with Gil Kaufman from the channel saying that the song and the music video [...] "added to Gaga's mind-tripping visual canon and further established her {{as one of the}} biggest triple threats in music." [...] PopMatters listed it at position73 on their list of [...] "The 75 Best Songs of 2011", with Sean McCarthy from the website saying that although Born This Way [...] "is a labor to listen to because of its over-the-topness. No such problems exist with the title track. All of the Gaga's strengths on her one-hour monolith are condensed into a four-minute unstoppable ode to the outcasts of the world."

500|$|In {{an early}} {{review by the}} trade {{magazine}} The Hollywood Reporter, Todd McCarthy said that, [...] "After nearly crashing and burning on his last solo flight in 2010, Iron Man returns refreshed and ready for action in this spirited third installment... benefits immeasurably from the irreverent quicksilver humor of co-writer and director Shane Black. Calling the film [...] "darker and more serious than its predecessors," [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times credited Black for [...] "chang this billion-dollar-plus franchise's tone for the better while keeping the same actor as Tony Stark. ... There is {{quite a bit of}} Black's trademark attitude and humor here as well, things like a throwaway reference to the sci-fi classic Westworld and a goofy character who has Tony Stark's likeness tattooed on his forearm. Black and company throw all kinds of stuff <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> and though it doesn't all work, a lot of it does and the attempt to be different and create unguessable twists is always appreciated." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday characterized Iron Man as [...] "the anti-Batman, all zip and zingers. He's also, suddenly, rather family-friendly. Some of the movie's best moments are shared by Stark and latchkey kid Harley (Ty Simpkins), who mock their budding father-son relationship while acting it out." [...] Psychology Today concluded that the film presented an accurate portrayal of Tony Stark's posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.|$|E
500|$|Divine {{eventually}} {{decided to}} abandon his agent, Robert Hussong, and replace him with his English friend Bernard Jay. Jay suggested that with his love of clubs, Divine could obtain work performing in them; as a result, Divine first appeared in 1979 at a gay club in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where his unscripted act included shouting [...] "fuck you" [...] repeatedly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> and then getting into a fight with another drag queen, a gimmick that proved popular with the club's clientele. Subsequently, he saw the commercial potential of including disco songs in with his act and, with Tom Eyen and composer Henry Krieger, created [...] "Born to be Cheap" [...] in 1981. In 1981 Divine appeared in John Waters's next film, Polyester, starring as Francine Fishpaw. Unlike earlier roles, Fishpaw was not a strong female but a meek and victimized woman {{who falls in love}} with her dream lover, Todd Tomorrow, played by Tab Hunter. In real life, tabloid publications claimed a romantic connection between them, an assertion both denied. The film was released in [...] "Odorama," [...] accompanied by [...] "scratch 'n' sniff" [...] cards for the audience to smell at key points in the film. Soon after Polyester, Divine auditioned for a male role in Ridley Scott's upcoming science-fiction film Blade Runner. Even though Scott thought Divine unsuitable for the part, he claimed to be enthusiastic about Divine's work and was very interested in including him in another of his films, but ultimately this never came about.|$|E
