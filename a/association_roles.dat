Mossé has identified 5 role analysis patterns {{that can be used to}} solve most role related problems: Role Inheritance, <b>Association</b> <b>Roles,</b> Role Classes, Generalised Role Classes and Association Class Roles. They all have various degrees of constraints, flexibility or power, which together offer a complete solution to most role-related problems.|$|E

At night, she's shown who will die in the morning, and can choose to save them.|$|E

However, recent bug fixing work on associations {{has revealed}} that the Fujaba code generation mechanisms for associations have a maintenance problem.

5000|$|An <b>{{association}}</b> <b>role</b> {{is given}} {{end of an}} association and describes {{the role of the}} corresponding class. For example, a [...] "subscriber" [...] role describes the way instances of the class [...] "Person" [...] participate in a [...] "subscribes-to" [...] association with the class [...] "Magazine". Also, a [...] "Magazine" [...] has the [...] "subscribed magazine" [...] role in the same <b>association.</b> <b>Association</b> <b>role</b> multiplicity describes how many instances correspond to each instance of the other class of the association. Common multiplicities are [...] "0..1", [...] "1..1", [...] "1..*" [...] and [...] "0..*", where the [...] "*" [...] specifies any number of instances.|$|R

We exploit the OCL meta model introduced in [9] and further elaborated on in [1] and base the description of properties of objects on collaborations, while classifier and <b>association</b> <b>roles</b> are used to describe navigation paths. Operations computing properties are described by interactions consisting of messages between classifier roles. The introduction of new graphical core elements is kept to a minimum. New notation mainly concerns the prede ned operations in OCL and provides more convenient visual forms for the notation by interactions here. The proposed visualization is described in detail and is illustrated with examples taken from an industrial project under development...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Data mining has {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} attention in the information industry in recent years and can be used for applications rangning from business management, production control, and science exploration etc. Most of the existing data mining algorithms are processing in the centralized systems; however, at present large database is usually distributed. Compared with the frequent itemsets lost and high communication traffic in distributed database conventional and improved algorithm FDM, An improved distributed data mining algorithm LTDM based on <b>association</b> <b>roles</b> is proposed. LTDM algorithm introduces the mapping indicated array mechanism to keep the integrity of frequent itemsets and decrease the communication traffic. The experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The algorithm can be applied to information retrieval and so on in the digital library...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the issue for {{translating}} Web metadata, especially Topic Maps and RDF/RDF Schema (RDF(S)). For the Semantic Web, all Web information resources should be accepted and understood by any browsers and web applications. Topic Maps and RDF are both representative international standards for description of Web information resources. However, they have different schemes and syntaxes, and thus much research has been studied to achieve the interoperability between both standards. However, there still remain several issues such as semantic loss, high structural complexity, and so on. This paper proposes an improved method for translating Topic Maps to RDF(S). Our method translates Topic Maps to RDF(S) based on topics, <b>association</b> <b>roles</b> and occurrences (TRO). The proposed method covers explicit semantics and implicit semantics by the object and the semantic mapping between Topic Maps and RDF(S). In addition, our method has strength {{in terms of the}} completeness and the naturalness. To illustrate the advantages of our proposal, we conduct experiments with several Topic Maps data sets and perform a comparativ...|$|E
40|$|AIM: This paper {{reports a}} study {{exploring}} the role perceptions and current activities in evidence-based practice promotion of professional nurses' associations in the Netherlands. Background: The promotion of evidence-based practice contributes to professional standards in nursing and good quality care for patients. As professional nurses' associations can be {{key players in}} this process, {{the nature of their}} roles and current activities deserves to be explored. METHODS: Roles and activities were explored for 43 professional nurses' associations (83 % of all national associations). Data were collected using interviews with the associations' board members. Findings from the interviews were validated with those from an analysis of the associations' policy reports and other publications in the previous 2 years. RESULTS: Board members primarily thought that they had roles in the selection and distribution of evidence. The roles of participant (n = 13) and performer (n = 13) in selecting evidence, and those of facilitator (n = 12), initiator (n = 15) and performer (n = 41) in the distribution of evidence were often addressed. A few respondents reflected on roles in generating evidence and implementing evidence-based practice in patient care. A majority of the associations was contemplating activities in the promotion of evidence-based practice. Specific activities for each of six relevant aspects in the promotion of evidence-based practice were found in fewer than five associations. CONCLUSION: Professional nurses' <b>association</b> <b>roles</b> in the promotion of evidence-based practice need to be viewed in relation to the tasks to be accomplished, especially those of selecting and distributing evidence. Although many organizations expressed motivation, professional nurses' associations {{have a long way to}} go in the promotion of evidence-based practice among their members...|$|E
40|$|UML's current {{definition}} of the role concept comes with many problems, not the least being {{that it is difficult}} to understand and communicate. This paper proposes a revised UML metamodel building on a much simpler role definition. Moreover, it replaces the rather unusual notions of <b>association</b> <b>role</b> and <b>association</b> end <b>role</b> as well as the rarely used association generalization with the more popular concept of overloading, thereby leading to a considerable reduction in the number of modelling concepts. Despite the rather radical nature of the proposed alterations, no changes in UML notation become necessary. However, a notable change in modelling style including in particular a clearer separation of structure and interaction diagrams are among the likely effects of the proposed revision. 1 Introduction UML's current version [OMG 1999] has three different definitions of the role concept: roles as names of <b>association</b> ends, <b>roles</b> as slots in collaborations, and roles as dyn [...] ...|$|R

Depending on tasks and entities involved, we have used four types of features: from simple words and terms, to words and semantic classes, to textual contexts, to contexts augmented with additional background attributes.
