5|$|A stereospecific form of (S)-mephedrone {{could be}} {{prepared}} via Friedel–Crafts <b>acylation.</b> The {{first step in}} the synthesis would be to react toluene and (S)-N-trifluoroacetylalanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminium chloride, then deprotect the intermediate with hydrochloric acid-propyl alcohol. This would produce (S)-4-methylcathinone, which could then be methylated to produce mephedrone.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkylation}} {{reaction is}} more widely used than the <b>acylation</b> reaction, although its practice is more technically demanding because {{the reaction is}} more sluggish. For both reactions, the aluminium chloride, {{as well as other}} materials and the equipment, should be dry, although a trace of moisture is necessary for the reaction to proceed. A general problem with the Friedel–Crafts reaction is that the aluminium chloride catalyst sometimes is required in full stoichiometric quantities, because it complexes strongly with the products. This complication sometimes generates a large amount of corrosive waste. For these and similar reasons, more recyclable or environmentally benign catalysts have been sought. Thus, the use of aluminium trichloride in some applications is being displaced by zeolites.|$|E

25|$|The Friedel–Crafts {{reactions}} are {{a set of}} reactions developed by Charles Friedel and James Crafts in 1877 to attach substituents to an aromatic ring.
