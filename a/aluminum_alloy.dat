5|$|Gary Klein, born , {{attended}} the University of California at Davis before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). During the Independent Activities Period in 1973, {{a group of}} students including Klein worked together under Professor Buckley to produce an aluminum framed bicycle. After analyzing a number of contemporary steel frames, and examining ones that had broken in use, they were able to determine the stresses placed on a bicycle frame. Faced with limited available types of <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloy</b> tubing, the students chose to construct frames from 6061 aluminium alloy seamless drawn tube; alternatives such as the stronger 7075 <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloy</b> were discarded because of the tubing dimensions.|$|E
5|$|The next year, he {{relocated}} to some disused buildings on his parents' farm in San Martin, California, {{that had previously}} been used for dehydrating prunes. In 1977, he patented use of large diameter <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloy</b> tubes to increase stiffness, and in 1980, he moved from San Jose, California, to Chehalis, Washington. He started production runs of road bicycles in the early 1980s and mountain bikes in the mid 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The Ju 87 was a single-engined {{all-metal}} cantilever monoplane. It had a fixed undercarriage {{and could}} carry a two-person crew. The main construction material was duralumin, and the external coverings {{were made of}} Duralumin sheeting. Parts that were required to be of strong construction, such as the wing flaps, were made of Pantal (a German <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloy</b> containing titanium as a hardening element) and its components made of Elektron. Bolts and parts that were required to take heavy stress were made of steel.|$|E

40|$|The ICME (Integrated Computational Materials Engineering) for <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys</b> {{was applied}} to combine key {{experiments}} with multi-scale numerical simulations from nano (10 - 10 - 10 - 8 m) to micro (10 - 8 - 10 - 4 m) to meso (10 - 4 - 10 - 2 m) and to macro (10 - 2 - 10 m) during the whole R&D (research and development) process of <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys.</b> Using integrated analysis of the composition-processing-structure-properties, the methodology for developing <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys</b> was promoted from trial and error to scientific design, SO the R & D of <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys</b> was significantly speed up and the cost was reduced. In this paper, multi-scale simulation approaches including Ab-initio, CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagram), phase field, and finite element method together with experimental methods characterizing structure and properties are elaborated. The function of each method in the R & D of <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys</b> is carefully discussed. Based on ICME, the framework for R & D of <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys,</b> involving end-user demand, product design and industrial design, is established. Two application examples are presented to describe {{the important role of}} ICME during the development stage of <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys,</b> which provides an innovative pattern for R & D of advanced <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys...</b>|$|R
40|$|In our research, {{the effects}} of rare-earth element erbium (Er) on microstructures and {{mechanical}} properties of some <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys</b> are investigated. It is shown that <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys</b> with Er additions, including Al-Mg, Al-Zn-Mg, Al-Zn-Mg-Cu, 1420 Al-Li alloys and high purity aluminum, have refined grain size, superior thermal stability, and higher hardness or tensile strength with unchanged ductility. It is concluded that, in most <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys,</b> Er is an effective alloying element...|$|R
5|$|Development of the I-212, {{one such}} variant, began in 1947 as a twin-engined, all-metal, two-seat jet fighter. The round, {{streamlined}} fuselage was optimized to reduce drag and house the {{considerable amount of}} equipment and fuel required by the VVS. It had mid-mounted straight laminar flow wings and the engine nacelles were mounted {{in the middle of}} the wing, with the wing spars continued by banjo rings around the engines. The cruciform tail unit was swept at 45°. To save weight, the main load-bearing structures of the airframe were constructed from V-95 <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloy</b> and high-strength steel. Elektron (a magnesium alloy) was used for many components and castings. The aircraft used a tricycle undercarriage with the main wheels retracting into the fuselage. Hydraulically actuated air brakes were fitted either side of the rear fuselage.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth was {{purchased}} from the American Smelting and Refining Company {{of the highest}} purity that it could produce. It was sent to Hanford, where it was put in aluminum cans, and placed inside a reactor for 100 days. The canned slugs then shipped to Unit IV, where they were bathed in hydrochloric acid, which dissolved the aluminum. This formed an aluminum chloride solution that was disposed of, as it was highly radioactive due to iron and copper in the <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloy.</b> The bismuth slugs were then dissolved in aqua regia. This was too weak for electroplating the polonium, so the nitric acid was removed, and then the polonium deposited on bismuth by adding powdered bismuth. This resulted in a 100–1 concentration. This could then be repeated by dissolving in aqua regia again to achieve a 1000–1 concentration. This was again dissolved, and the polonium electroplated on platinum foils. The main problem with the process was that it required glass-lined containers due to the aqua regia, and mechanisms for safe handling of the radioactive material. The Dayton Project explored alternative purification methods that {{were found to be}} workable, but less efficient or safe.|$|E
25|$|Produced from 1941 to 1945, the V-770 {{featured}} a two-piece <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloy</b> crankcase, steel barreled cylinders with integral <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloy</b> fins and <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloy</b> heads. The V-770 {{was the only}} American inverted V12-type inline air-cooled engine to reach production. The engine was used in very few Army Air Forces aircraft, among them the short lived Fairchild AT-21 twin-engine bomber trainer, and in the two Bell XP-77 light-weight fighter prototypes.|$|E
40|$|The stress {{relaxation}} behavior and springback equation of 7050 <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys</b> during the age-forming process were studied through self-designed uniaxial tension device. The {{results show that}} in traditional aging temperature, the {{stress relaxation}} curve of 7050 <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys</b> exhibits a classical logarithmic decrement curve. The stress relaxation process {{can be divided into}} three stages, which are the initial stress decayed fast stage, the subsequent stress slowly decayed stage and the stress constantly maintained stage, respectively. Stress relaxation limit of 7050 <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys</b> decreases with increasing aging temperature. The threshold stress presents during the stress relaxation process due to the interaction between precipitation behavior and dislocation creep of 7050 <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys.</b> The stress relaxation equation of 7050 <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys</b> is obtained through resolving the feature and Taylor equation of relaxation process, and using the stress relaxation equation can precisely predict the springback of workpiece after age-forming...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{corrosive}} media on rotating bending fatigue lives (the cyclic numbers from 104 to 108) of different <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys</b> were investigated, which involved the corrosion fatigue lives of five kinds of <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys</b> in air, at 3. 5 wt. % and 5. 0 wt. % NaCl aqueous solutions. Experimental {{results indicate that}} corrosive media have different harmful influences on fatigue lives of different <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys,</b> in which the differences of corrosion fatigue lives depend strongly on the plastic property (such as the elongation parameter) of <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys</b> and whether to exist with and without fracture mode II. The other various influence factors (such as the dropping corrosive liquid rate, the loading style, and the nondimensionalization of strength) of corrosion fatigue lives in three media were also discussed in detail by using the typical cases. Furthermore, fracture morphologies and characteristics of samples, which showed the different fatigue cracking behaviors of <b>aluminum</b> <b>alloys</b> in three media, were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in this paper...|$|R
