5|$|A weak {{surface area}} of low {{pressure}} detached from a frontal system on August 8 while 1,150miles (1,850km) to the east of Bermuda. It moved southwestward, and on August 9, it generated convection as it passed beneath a cold-core upper-level low. The surface low and the upper-level low turned westward as it revolved around a common center, and by August 11, the surface low developed into a trough while 440miles (700km) south of Bermuda.

5|$|Tropical Storm Bret was {{the second}} named storm of the 2011 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season. Bret formed along the southwestern periphery of a weather front north of the Bahamas on July 17.

Steering currents in the area subsequently became better established, and Bret turned toward the northeast only to encounter <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> <b>increase</b> in vertical wind shear. Despite the shear, the storm maintained a well-defined wind circulation for several days, with intermittent bursts of thunderstorms near its center.

5|$|By 5 April, the JTWC began issuing {{advisories}} on Gwenda, classifying it as a weak {{tropical storm}} and designating it as Cyclone 32S. Tracking southwest {{in response to}} a subtropical ridge to the south, Gwenda began to rapidly intensify. Its forward motion significantly decreased as it turned due south before curving towards the southeast, and in a 30-hour span, maximum winds around the centre of the storm increased from 75km/h (45mph) to 225km/h (140mph). The barometric pressure decreased by 90hPa (mbar), making Gwenda one of the fastest intensifying storms on record. At the end of the intensification phase on 7April, the Bureau of Meteorology classified the storm as a Category 5 cyclone, the third of the season, with a pressure of 900hPa (mbar).

5|$|Juárez Celman's {{administration}} saw <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> <b>increase</b> in {{the ratio}} of debt to GDP {{toward the end of}} his tenure and an increasing weakness in the fiscal situation. The Baring Brothers merchant bank had developed a close and profitable association with Argentina, and when Celman's government was unable to meet its payments to the House of Baring, a financial crisis ensued. Argentina defaulted and suffered bank runs as the Baring Brothers faced failure. The crisis was caused by the lack of co-ordination between monetary policy and fiscal policy, which ultimately led to the collapse of the banking system. The financial crisis of 1890 left the government with no funds for its immigration subsidies programme, and it was abolished in 1891. Loans to Argentina were severely curtailed, and imports had to be cut sharply. Exports were less affected, but the value of Argentine exports did not surpass the 1889 peak until 1898.|$|E

The following day, the Foreign Ministry invited professor Jan Sundberg of the Department of Political and Economic Studies at the University of Helsinki to lead an analysis of the result. He was asked about the reasons for the True Finns' performance and the commonality with other European populist movements.

5|$|On taking power Henry gave a high {{priority}} to the restoration of royal finances in England, reviving Henry I's financial processes and attempting {{to improve the quality}} of the royal accounting. Revenue from the demesne formed the bulk of Henry's income in England, although taxes were used heavily in the first 11 years of his reign. Aided by the capable Richard FitzNeal, Henry reformed the currency in 1158, putting his name on English coins for the first time and heavily reducing the number of moneyers licensed to produce coins. These measures were successful in improving his income, but on his return to England in the 1160s Henry took further steps. New taxes were introduced and the existing accounts re-audited, and the reforms of the legal system brought in new streams of money from fines and amercements. A wholesale reform of the coinage occurred in 1180, with royal officials taking direct control of the mints and passing the profits directly to the treasury. A new penny, called the Short Cross, was introduced, and the number of mints reduced substantially to ten across the country. Driven by the reforms, the royal revenues increased significantly; during the first part of the reign, Henry's average exchequer income was only around £18,000; after 1166, the average was around £22,000. One economic effect of these changes was <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> <b>increase</b> in the amount of money in circulation in England and, post-1180, a significant, long-term increase in both inflation and trade.|$|E

Of this, the population in the eastern portion of the North Pacific was estimated to be 25,000 to 27,000. By 1975, the estimate had declined to between 8,000 and 16,000. Surveys conducted in 1991, 1993, 1996, and 2001 produced estimates between 1,600 and 3,200 off California and 280 and 380 off Oregon and Washington. The minimum estimate for the California-Oregon-Washington population, as defined in the U.S. Pacific Marine Mammal Stock Assessments: 2005, is about 2,500. Surveys in coastal waters of British Columbia in summers 2004 and 2005 produced abundance estimates of approximately 500 animals. Surveys near the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea indicated <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> <b>increase</b> in the local abundance of fin whales between 1975–1978 and 1987–1989. In 1984, the entire population was estimated to be less than 38% of its historic carrying capacity. Fin whales might have started returning to the coastal waters off British Columbia (a sighting occurred in Johnstone Strait in 2011) and Kodiak Island. Size of the local population migrating to Hawaiian Archipelago is unknown. Historically, several other wintering grounds were scattered in the North Pacific in the past, such as off the Northern Mariana Islands, Bonin Islands, and Ryukyu Islands (for other possible habitats, see blue whale as their habitat preferences may correspond).
