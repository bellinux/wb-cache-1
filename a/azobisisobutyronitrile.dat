50|$|It is {{a useful}} reagent in organic synthesis. Combined with <b>azobisisobutyronitrile</b> (AIBN) or by {{irradiation}} with light, tributyltin hydride converts organic halides (and related groups) to the corresponding hydrocarbon. This process occurs via a radical chain mechanism involving the radical Bu3Sn•. The radical abstracts a H• from another equivalent of tributyltin hydride, propagating the chain. Tributyltin hydride's utility as a H• donor {{can be attributed to}} its relatively weak bond strength (78 kcal/mol). Recently, transition metal hydrides have emerged as attractive alternatives to tin hydrides, as transition metal hydrides can be used catalytically and have more variety in bond strength.|$|E
