40|$|It {{is fully}} {{known that the}} {{premises}} for market economics resides on free competition. In other words, market player must make all the necessary efforts {{in order to obtain}} the desired results on their own, through business innovation and increased efficiency. In order to protect this, the competition primary and secondary legislation is carefully tailored to such needs, supporting and protecting the internal market from the companies’ tendency to distort competition. As such, competition law offers the companies’ involved in <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>agreements</b> methods to either waive the entire fine or to diminish it considerably. The aim is to encourage companies to bring upfront <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>agreements</b> that aim to distort competition and free market, thus protecting the internal market. The competition law itself does not pursue to sanction players that acted in an anticompetitive manner, but to prevent such behavior, because prevention is more important than reducing the effects afterwards. In the present paper we aim to make a radiography of the methods of eliminating or reducing a fine that a company have in our national law when it comes to <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>agreements...</b>|$|R

Following the examination of the main conditions and reasons for cartel formation and sustainability, and a statistical analysis of cartel prosecu-tions, our attempt is to show that leniency programs, accompanied by strong en-forcement powers and effective sanctions, increase the inherent instability of car-tels and therefore have proven to represent a functional and successful tool for detecting and punishing, as well as preventing the formation of <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>agreements...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Leniency {{program that}} has been {{analyzed}} raises the question concerning its effectiveness in fighting with the cartel agreements and whether it encourages the participants of the cartel enough to betray other participants of the cartel agreement. Examining such effectiveness is hard enough because of the secret character of functioning of cartels themselves and, in fact, {{it is not known}} how many cartel agreements exist in the Polish economy. The aim of the article is to analyze the effectiveness of methods of combating <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>agreements</b> such as cartels through mechanisms of the Leniency program.

The amendments to competition legislation establish a case of removing anti-competitive acts liability for rewarding companies that cooperate with the authorities to denounce anti-competitive practices and a case for reducing the penalty for contravention, for those who, although not qualified for immunity from fine, actually have an important and actually role in uncovering anticompetitive practices.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the design of competition laws and economic outcomes remains the subject of considerable controversy in both law and economics. Recent cross-national studies suggest that effective legal constraints against anticompetitive practices can enhance prospects for economic development by {{increasing the number of}} market participants and the quality of broader political and economic institutions. This paper explores the linkages between regulatory constraints against anticompetitive practices and the efficiency of market mechanisms by focusing on the experience in Poland between the collapse of central planning and regulatory harmonization pursuant to European Union accession. The analysis suggests that per se prohibitions and a narrow bureaucratic mandate provided relatively credible and predictable constraints against <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>agreements</b> and practices during the formative days of the market system in Poland. The evidence has implications for other jurisdictions that instead implement the rule-of-reason approach to the design of competition law during the 1980 s and 1990 s. ...|$|R

This article critically reviews the reasons for recognising the right to damages {{as a matter of law}} and policy and then attempts to identify situations where a plaintiff may assert a right to damages. Moreover, the right to damages creates a set of as yet unspecified obligations on potential defendants. While dominant undertakings have special obligations towards those they contract with, the existence of and justification for imposing similar duties on undertakings on the basis of Article 81 is less easy to explain.

40|$|Agreements between {{firms to}} jointly reduce {{production}} capacity generally violate competition law, unless specific conditions are met. These conditions {{imply that the}} agreements need to realize benefits for consumers that could not otherwise be realised. Together, we call them “efficiency defence. ” Initiated by a societal debate in the Netherlands, we analyze how environmental benefits can be included in this framework. We apply this analysis to a proposed agreement among electricity producers to jointly advance the closure {{of a number of}} coal-fired power plants. Using shadow prices as developed in environmental economics, we assess the environmental benefits of this proposed agreement. We conclude that the environmental benefits for the consumers involved are significantly smaller than the loss of consumer welfare resulting from the increase in the electricity price caused by the closure of power plants. Hence, such an agreement would infringe competition law. This case, however, shows that it is feasible to incorporate environmental effects into an efficiency defence of an <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>agreement</b> made for the purpose of sustainability...|$|E
40|$|The paper investigates {{enforcement}} of criminal sanctions in anti-bid rigging policy in Russia. Although cartels were criminalized in 1997, parties of numerous anticompetitive agreements on tenders are punished by corporate or individual fines, or disqualified. Statistics on sentences for bid rigging are highly controversial although legislative conditions for efficient criminalization are presented {{not only by}} criminal norms but also by leniency programmes in administrative and criminal proceedings which were designed to contribute to anticartel enforcement. The aim {{of this research is}} to determine factors that have caused the very rare use of criminal sanctions for cartel enforcement with the focus on bid rigging. For the purpose of the research, the paper outlines the regulation of tendering in Russia and the system of sanctions for bid rigging, including leniency. Case analysis of the first custodial sentence for <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>agreement</b> on a public tender highlights specific features resulting in successful prosecution. Since {{this is one of the}} first attempts to assess criminalization of bid rigging in Russia, original empirical data including interviews with officials from federal competition authorities and regional representatives constitute the basis of the study. Findings of the research determine the influence of social norms on the enforcement as the main challenge for criminalization of bid rigging which is weighed down by the insufficient political influence of competition authorities. The paper’s findings may be of interest for assessing enforcement in other jurisdictions experiencing the same difficulties. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the quest}} of globalization, India has countered {{positively}} by opening up its economy, removing controls and resorting to liberalization. Thus, {{to achieve the}} objective of maximum economic efficiency, the liberal trade policy must be complimented through a sound competition policy by preventing anti-competitive business practices and unnecessary government intervention. The Competition Act, 2002 as amended by the Competition (Amendment) Act, 2007, removing the former MRTP Act, 1969, follows the philosophy of modern competition laws and aims at fostering competition and at protecting Indian markets against anti-competitive practices by enterprises. The Act prohibits <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>agreements,</b> abuse of dominant position by enterprises, and regulates entering into combinations (consisting of mergers, amalgamations and acquisitions) with a view to ensure that there is no adverse effect on competition in India. In view of this, this article tries to highlight the issues and challenges contained in the Indian Competition Act, 2002 in ensuring competitive business environment. A good competition policy, along with a sound competition law, should help in fostering competition, economic efficiency, consumer welfare and freedom of trade, which should equip the Governments in meeting the challenges of globalization by increasing competition in local and national markets...|$|R
40|$|In their {{economic}} activity, undertakings conclude many agreements between them. But {{agreements between undertakings}} which can distort the competition -anticompetitive agreements- are prohibited. The Romanian and EU law prohibit &# 39;all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition&# 39;.

40|$|There is a {{widening}} consensus among jurisdictions with competition laws that “the basic objective of competition {{policy is to}} protect competition as the most appropriate means of ensuring the efficient allocation of resources—and thus efficientmarket outcomes—in free market economies. ” 1 As this statement indicates, it is efficiency, not competition, that is {{the ultimate goal of}} the antitrust laws. One of the senior economists of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division put it very well recently: “efficiency is the goal, competition is the process. ” 2 When the competitive process is allowed to run its course—unfettered by exclusionary practices or <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>agreements</b> among firms—the incentive of firms to lure away rivals’ customers by offering them lower prices, superior quality, or new product features will necessarily lead these firms to seek more efficient ways to do business. Only by devising more efficient means to produce and distribute their goods, or by finding ways to offer superior or additional features for the same cost, can firms displace sales by their competitors. Antitrust enforcement therefore assumes as its mandate the deterrence of business conduct that threatens to distort the competitive process in product and innovation markets...|$|R
40|$|The ECJ’s {{judgment}} in Coop de France represents an important clarification and {{affirmation of the}} basic principles and objectives of the EC fining policy for violations of the competition law. In the present case the Community courts encountered the situation where the appellants were in effect attempting to escape the prosecution for the established violation of competition law by concluding and implementing an <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>agreement</b> {{for the benefit of}} its members. The judgment demonstrated that the issue of ‘objective interests’ {{can make a difference in}} calculating the fines. Here the Court exemplified the importance of this concept when addressing the principle of non bis in idem and existence of the common members that took part in various associations at the same time. The ruling provided that in situation where the interests of an association are identical to those of its members’ the fining based on the latter’s turnover is justified. The ECJ’s ruling once again indicated the adherence to the main objective of the fining policy articulated in the preceding case law and 2006 fining guidelines: “Fines should have a sufficiently deterrent effect, not only in order to sanction the undertakings concerned (specific deterrence) but also in order to deter other undertakings from engaging in, or continuing, behaviour that is contrary to Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty (general deterrence) ”. It could be expected that the clarification of the legal standards made by the Community courts will contribute to the prevention of the infringements where associations are used as a convenient legal vehicles for fostering anticompetitive objectives, beneficial to their members...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present thesis is to analyse the {{relationship}} between competition law and economics on the example of the USA and the EU. In the first chapter is mentioned the context that led to the issuance of antitrust laws in the USA, the EU and other countries, as well as the most significant economic theories which had a major influence on the application of competition law. This is followed by the description of the institutional framework of competition law in the USA and the EU, their respective primary sources of law, including non-legislative documents. The second chapter analyses the most significant anticompetitive conducts for both antitrust areas (i. e. <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>agreements</b> and unilateral conducts), with a special attention to the most harmful anticompetitive conducts (e. g. horizontal price fixing) and to relatively new and dynamically developing areas of antitrust law (e. g. refusal to deal related to intellectual property).

40|$|As the Philippines {{move toward}} the {{legislation}} of its comprehensive competition law, one important issue that has emerged is {{the interaction between the}} competition agency and sector regulators. Based on a review of different approaches that different countries have adopted, the paper develops a framework for the interplay between regulatory agencies and competition authority in the Philippines. Taking into account the country's stages of institutional development and market and policy reforms, the paper proposes an approach that would leave competition enforcement exclusively {{in the hands of the}} competition authority while technical and economic regulation would be performed by the sector regulator. At the same time, the sector regulator may be given competition law enforcement functions to be performed in coordination with the competition authority. The proposed approach would be based on a cooperation mechanism with sector regulators taking the leading role in economic and technical issues while the competition authority will be the lead in competition issues like abuse of dominance, <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>agreements,</b> cartels and merger review. It is important that the two coordinate and consult with each other to ensure that the policies or remedial measures taken by one would not be against the mandate of the other. The competition functions of the authority such as assuring nondiscriminatory access to essential networks and controlling other forms of anticompetitive conduct and merger review may be shared with sector regulators...|$|R
40|$|B 2 B is a {{business-to-business}} {{market place}} that uses internet to connect each other business. It {{has gotten a}} lot more attention recently in Japan {{as well as in}} the U. S. because it is possible to lower the procurement costs of raw material and accomplish several procompetitive effects such as communication efficiencies. However, in spite of these pro transactional natures of B 2 B, it could also cause anticompetitive effects on market place. In other words, the fact that buyers communicate easily through the internet means they could easily form a cartel or conclude an agreement to restrain the free competition and it is easy to detect deviation from those agreements. There must have been buyers’ <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>agreements</b> long before B 2 B and these agreements were concluded without using the internet-based communication. However, the potential for B 2 B to aid buyers’ agreements is worth to get attention. Despite this importance, there have been little cases and studies concerning buyers’ agreement even in the U. S. and, in Japan, there have been neither cases nor the detail examination by the governmental agencies about buyers’ <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>agreements.</b> This is because traditionally sellers have had a strong bargaining power over purchasers. Therefore, little attention has been focused on anticompetitive effects which might be caused by buyers’ agreements. The internet, however, drastically changed the bargaining power balance between sellers and purchasers. It has made possible for purchasers to form a cartel to decrease the input purchased and lower the price through the web-based communication. The paper examines the competitive aspects of B 2 B from the view point of the antitrust law and analyzes oligopsony, that is, buyers’ collusion to exercise their market power to decrease the price of the products they are going to buy from suppliers by depressing the quantity of input purchased artificially. Drawing on microeconomic theory and antitrust law, the interdisciplinary work in the paper explores the implications of oligopsony, or buying power, for antitrust policy. The paper offers a systematic treatment of the topic, demonstrating that whether or not oligopsony power exists because of a dominant buyer or collusion among buyers, it can cause social welfare losses analogous to those occasioned by monopoly. The paper also discusses bilateral monopoly and offers a principled basis for distinguishing between socially desirable and undesirable cooperative buying. In addition, the paper analyzes the legal response to an oligopsony agreement in the U. S. as well as in Japan in order to examine how an oligopsony agreement should be treated. Further, the paper discusses tangential facts and circumstantial evidence to find an oligopsony agreement, because, in the antitrust practice, whether or not it is possible to find an agreement is sometimes the decisive point. The paper tries to provide the practical precepts to find an agreement which would be concluded on B 2 B...|$|R
40|$|The {{desire to}} {{maintain}} {{themselves on a}} particular market, {{at a higher level}} of profitability or at a reasonable level at least, can lead the undertakings to adopt an anticompetitive behaviour more easily. This may result from either the existence of <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>agreements</b> and concerted practices, or the tendency to abuse its dominant position which the undertaking has on a certain market. “The undertaking” and “the relevant market” are the key concepts in the analysis of anticompetitive practices. The active subject of anticompetitive practices is “the undertaking”. This concept has a particular significance in the competition law, different from the common law. Competition rules apply to the conduct of undertakings and associations of undertakings so that the concept of undertaking makes it possible to determine the categories of actors to which the competition rules apply. However, the term undertaking is nowhere defined in the EU Treaties; as such, the concept has generated a complex body of jurisprudence. "The market" is a term with pronounced economic resonances; synthetically, the market is the place where supply meets demand. In the context of the competition law, "the market" means "relevant market". The relevant market is the market of product/service in terms of demand and supply, and then superimposed on the geographic market. The analysis of these key concepts necessarily entails the conceptual delimitation of the notions. On this purpose, the relevant legal provisions will be identified in the Romanian and EU law, together with the decisions of the European Court of Justice in this matter...|$|R

40|$|Many {{instances}} of anticompetitive collusion are designed not to affect prices and output directly, {{but rather to}} shape the rules under which competition takes place.

40|$|In its Twombly {{decision}} the Supreme Court {{held that}} an antitrust complaint failed because its allegations {{did not include}} enough “factual matter” to justify proceeding to discovery. Two years later the Court extended this new pleading standard to federal complaints generally. Twombly’s broad language {{has led to a}} broad rewriting of federal pleading doctrine. Naked market division conspiracies such as the one pled in Twombly must be kept secret because antitrust enforcers will prosecute them when they are detected. This inherent secrecy, which the Supreme Court did not discuss, has dire consequences for pleading if too much factual specificity is required. Indeed, it can close the door in cases where the conspiracy is reasonably suspected but supporting evidence has not already been uncovered. In the paradigm cartel case the defendants meet secretly in a hotel room and plot prices or output. But antitrust agreements can be proven by other evidence, including evidence of interdependence, parallel behavior, and actions contrary to independent self-interest. By indicating that the complaint failed because it did not state “which of their employees” may have conspired and that there was some “when” or “where” that the agreement took place, the Court was apparently requiring the plaintiff to plead something in its complaint that existing law would not require it to show in order to avoid summary judgment or a JML at trial. Or to say it differently, the Court was changing conspiracy doctrine {{at the same time that}} it was changing pleading doctrine 6. The most salient fact about Twombly is that, although it was a proof-of-agreement case, the claim was of geographic market division rather than parallel pricing. For all of its lengthy discussion about the facts essential to a good complaint, the Supreme Court paid little attention to the difference between price fixing and market division. While parallel pricing typically is interdependent conduct, parallel failures to enter one another’s markets typically are not. As a result, methods of indirect proof that might work in a case alleging unlawful price fixing are unlikely to work in one alleging unlawful market division. Twombly clearly reached the correct conclusion, but it could have done less damage to the values of notice pleading stated in the Federal Rules had it focused more narrowly on the mechanisms by which <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>agreements</b> are proven. Pleading reform requires, not an increase in “factual matter,” but rather a closer correlation between the legal elements that must be proven and the allegations in a complaint...|$|R
