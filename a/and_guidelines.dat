5|$|The {{agreement}} was prepared at the EC {{council of ministers}} in The Hague on 5 July. It consisted of a Joint Declaration, and two annexes detailing {{the creation of an}} environment suitable to further political negotiations <b>and</b> <b>guidelines</b> for an observer mission to Yugoslavia. The agreement, which became known as the Brioni Declaration or the Brioni Agreement, required the JNA and the TDS to return to their bases, and stipulated that Slovene officials were to control Slovenia's borders alone and that both Slovenia and Croatia were to suspend all activities stemming from their declarations of independence for three months. The observer mission set out by the Brioni Agreement materialised as the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) tasked with monitoring the disengagement of the JNA and the TDS in Slovenia, and ultimately the withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia.|$|E

The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending {{on the nature of}} the game. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football.|$|E

An Act of Congress and two Executive Orders, in 1847 and 1897, had reserved the island for the federal lighthouse and for military purposes. Patient legal work eventually convinced the U.S. Congress and President Woodrow Wilson to agree to recognize Matheson's and Deering's ownership of Key Biscayne.|$|E

5|$|Taizu also {{displayed}} {{a strong interest}} in science and technology. He employed the Imperial Workshop to support such projects as Zhang Sixun's hydraulic-powered armillary sphere (for astronomical observation and time-keeping) that used liquid mercury instead of water (because liquid mercury would not freeze during winter). Emperor Taizu was also quite open-minded in his affairs, especially with those perceived as foreigners: he appointed the Arab Muslim Ma Yize (910–1005) as the chief astronomer of the Song court. For receiving envoys from the Korean kingdom of Goryeo alone, the Song court had roughly 1,500 volumes written about the nuanced rules, regulations, <b>and</b> <b>guidelines</b> for their reception. The Song also sent envoys abroad, such as Wang Yande (939–1006), who was sent as an official envoy to the Uyghur-Turkic city of Gaochang in 981, then under Kara-Khanid control. From the 2nd century onwards, ancient Chinese histories even record that embassies of the Roman Empire ("Daqin") and Byzantine Empire ("Fu lin") arrived in China. As recorded in the History of Song and Wenxian Tongkao, the last known arrival of Byzantine envoys came in 1081, apparently sent by Michael VII Doukas to the court of Emperor Shenzong of Song. However, the History of Yuan records that a Byzantine man served as an astronomer and physician at the court of Kublai Khan during the subsequent Yuan dynasty, and in 1371 the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty sent an alleged Byzantine merchant (who was likely Nicolaus de Bentra, Archbishop of Khanbaliq) to inform the Byzantine ruler of the founding of the new dynasty.|$|E

40|$|In current medical practice, {{research}} based {{evidence is}} an important foundation for clinical decision making. Clinical practice guidelines are a major instrument for keeping physicians up-to-date about this evidence. In order to provide optimal care to both men and women, {{it is important that}} sex differences are routinely considered in biomedical studies and that the results—positive or negative—are routinely reported in clinical guidelines. However, there is still limited attention given to sex differences in health research <b>and</b> in <b>guideline</b> development. Public organizations for the funding of health research <b>and</b> <b>guideline</b> development organizations can play a role in improving this situation.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} is to:a. Highlight the most {{important}} <b>guidelines</b> <b>and</b> practices of quality in the pharmaceutical industry. b. Organize such <b>guidelines</b> <b>and</b> practices to create a guide {{to pave the way for}} other researchers who would like to dig deeper into these <b>guidelines</b> <b>and</b> practices. DesignA review was conducted of 102 publications; 56 publications were concerned with the pharmaceutical quality directly while 46 publications were concerned with the general quality practices. The content of those sources was analyzed and the following themes were identified:a. Research theme 1 : Guidelines of the pharmaceutical quality. b. Research theme 2 : General practices recently applied in the pharmaceutical industry. Main outcome measuresThe following <b>guidelines</b> were identified <b>and</b> reviewed: WHO <b>guidelines,</b> FDA <b>guidelines,</b> EU <b>guidelines</b> <b>and</b> ICH <b>guidelines</b> in the research theme I. In research theme II; the following topics were identified and reviewed: quality risk management, quality by design, corrective actions and preventive actions, process capability analysis, Six Sigma, process analytical technology, lean manufacturing, total quality management, ISO series and HACCP. ResultsUpon reviewing the previously highlighted <b>guidelines</b> <b>and</b> the practices that are widely applied in the pharmaceutical industry, it was noticed that there is an abundant number of papers and articles that explain the general <b>guidelines</b> <b>and</b> practices but the literature lack those describing application; case studies of the pharmaceutical factories applying those <b>guidelines</b> <b>and</b> significance of those <b>guidelines</b> <b>and</b> practices. ConclusionsIt is recommended that the literature would invest more in the area of application <b>and</b> significance of <b>guidelines</b> <b>and</b> practices. New case studies should be done to prove the feasibility of such practices...|$|R
