40|$|Accurate {{detection}} of atrial fibrillation (AF) {{is essential for}} appropriate operation of an implantable atrial defibrillator (IAD). However, during episodes of sinus tachycardia, distinction between AF and sinus rhythm (SR) using the 'quiet interval' and 'baseline crossing' analysis in the detection algorithm of the IAD may be difficult. The efficacy of this <b>AF</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm was tested in five patients implanted with an IAD (METRIX, Model 3000 or 3020, InControl Inc.) during treadmill exercise testing. The IADs were programmed to Monitor Mode with a wake up cycle of 1 minute for <b>AF</b> <b>detection</b> using the device nominal parameters or modified parameters, and to mark rhythms appropriate for shock delivery. A mean peak heart rate of 137 ± 26 beats/min was reached during maximum exercise, and one patient developed transient AF. Seventy-eight (75 in SR, 3 in AF) and 91 (89 in SR, 2 in AF) runs of <b>AF</b> <b>detection</b> were performed using the nominal and modified parameters, respectively. The IAD detected AF and SR accurately, except for one episode of false-positive <b>AF</b> <b>detection</b> during sinus tachycardia at the nominal settings, but inappropriate shocks were prevented by minimum RR interval criteria that limited discharge at high heart rate. These {{results indicate that the}} <b>AF</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm in the IAD may become more vulnerable to false-positive <b>AF</b> <b>detection</b> during sinus tachycardia, which were avoided by reprogramming the Quiet Interval and minimum RR interval criteria for <b>AF</b> <b>detection.</b> Exercise testing appeared useful to program optimal settings of the IAD in preparation for daily activities. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

As the field of cellomics is expected to become a very important one, a chip to perform single cell analysis will be developed. Therefore, the chip has to consist of a sorting unit, sampling unit and a connection to an analysing unit. Methods: The research is divided in autofluorescence (<b>AF)</b> cell <b>detection,</b> electroporation, needle puncture and picosampling. <b>AF</b> cell <b>detection</b> and localization has been performed on a microfluidic glass chip using granulocytes and red blood cells. For electroporation, cells are trapped and electrodes generating a high electrical field create pores in the cell membrane. Further, siliconnitride microneedles (260 nm thick) have been made to analyse needle puncture through a cell membrane. Results: With confocal microscopy, it is possible to sort red blood cells from granulocytes on a microfluidic glass chip {{on the basis of their}} intrinsic AF. Further, non-viable cells were distinguished from viable cells due to a lower AF intensity. For the sampling unit, an electroporation device and sharp needles have been made to be able to manipulate a cell. Extraction of cell fluid from oocytes has been performed.

ObjectiveThe study aimed to validate an algorithm {{designed to reduce}} inappropriate <b>AF</b> <b>detection</b> {{on the basis of}} the identification of a single P wave during the cardiac cycle. MethodsThe original detection algorithm looks for evidence of AF based on differences in the pattern of R-R intervals over a 2 -minute period. The improved algorithm reduces evidence for <b>AF</b> <b>detection</b> if P waves are detected. The algorithm was validated by using Holter data, which collected 2 leads of surface electrocardiogram and continuously uplinked ICM electrocardiogram over a 46 -hour period. ICM detections were compared with Holter annotations to compute episode and duration detection performance. ResultsValid Holter recordings (8442 hours) were analyzed from 206 patients. True AF was observed in 76 patients, yielding 482 true AF episodes ≥ 2 minutes in duration and 1191 hours of AF. The algorithm correctly identified 97. 8 % of the total AF duration and 99. 3 % of the total sinus or non-AF rhythm duration. The algorithm detected 85 % (90 % per-patient average) of all AF episodes ≥ 2 minutes in duration, and 55 % (78 % per-patient average) of the detected episodes had AF.

The scheme {{was based on the}} recognition of altered AF 4 retention through the generation of the size-increased Au nanoparticle probes as a result of PA binding, in which a PA-selective peptide was conjugated on the probe surface. In the visible absorption-based AF 4 fractograms, the band position shifted to a longer retention time as the PA concentration increased due to the presence of probe bound with PAs. The shift was insignificant when the concentration was relatively low at 84. 3 pM. To improve sensitivity, two separate probes conjugated with two different peptides able to bind on different PA epitopes were used together. The band shift then became distinguishable even at 84. 3 pM of PA sample. The formation of larger PA-probe inter-connected species using the dual-probe system was responsible for the enhanced band shift. In parallel, the feasibility of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as a potential <b>AF</b> 4 <b>detection</b> method was also evaluated. In the off-line SERS fractogram constructed using fractions collected during AF 4 separation, a band shift was also observed for the 84. 3 pM PA sample, and the band intensity was higher when using the dualprobe system. The combination of AF 4 and SERS is promising for the detection of PA and will become a potential tool if the reproducibility of SERS measurement is improved. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{the most}} common cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice. It often starts with asymptomatic and short episodes, which are difficult to detect without the assistance of automatic monitoring tools. The vast majority of methods proposed for this purpose are based on quantifying the irregular ventricular response (i. e., RR series) during the arrhythmia. However, although AF totally alters the atrial activity (AA) reflected on the electrocardiogram (ECG), replacing stable P-waves by chaotic and time-variant fibrillatory waves, this information has still not been explored for automated screening of AF. Hence, a pioneering AF detector based on quantifying the variability over time of the AA morphological pattern is here proposed. Results from two public reference databases have proven that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms, reporting accuracy higher than 90 %. A less false positive rate in the presence of other arrhythmias different from AF was also noticed. Finally, the combination of this algorithm with the classical analysis of RR series variability also yielded a promising trade-off between <b>AF</b> accuracy and <b>detection</b> delay.

Three of the most common methods for starch dissolution were investigated, i. e. dissolution in water at high temperatures (120 °C – 200 °C) using autoclaving or microwaving heating, and dissolution in DMSO at 100 °C. The results showed that autoclaving aqueous solutions at 140 °C and dissolution in DMSO at 100 °C were suitable methods for dissolving amylopectin, whereas dissolution in DMSO was the optimum method for dissolving amylose...|$|R
40|$|Large scale image {{retrieval}} {{systems for}} speci c objects generally employ visual words {{together with a}} ranking based on a geometric relation between the query and target images. Previous work has used planar homographies for this geometric relation. Here we replace the planar transformation by epipolar geometry {{in order to improve}} the retrieval performance for 3 D structures. To this end, we introduce a new minimal solution for computing the af ne fundamental matrix. The solution requires only two corresponding elliptical regions. Unlike previous approaches it does not require the rotation of the image patches, and ensures that the necessary epipolar tangency constraints are satis ed. The solution is well suited for real time reranking in large scale image retrieval, since (i) elliptical correspondences are readily available from the <b>af</b> ne region <b>detections,</b> and (ii) the use of only two region correspondences is very ef cient in a RANSAC framework where the number of samples required grows exponentially with sample size. We demonstrate a gain in computational ef ciency (over other methods of solution) without a loss in quality of the estimated epipolar geometry. We present a quantitative performance evaluation on the Oxford and Paris image retrieval benchmarks, and demonstrate that retrieval of 3 D structures is indeed improved. ...|$|R
40|$|Background Although atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) {{is the most}} commonly encountered arrhythmia, some of the properties make its detection challenging. In daily practice, underdiagnosis can lead to less effective treatment in prevention of stroke. Based on data from studies on treatment of AF, more intensive follow-up strategies, including 7 -day Holter recording, 30 -day event recording, and even implantable cardiac monitoring devices, are suggested. The study purpose is to evaluate {{the performance of a}} continuous single-channel loop recorder with automatic <b>AF</b> <b>detection</b> and transtelephonic electrocardiogram (ECG) transmission capabilities. Methods and Results A consecutive cohort of 153 patients admitted to the stroke unit with a presumptive diagnosis of ischemic cerebrovascular accident was screened for AF. Twenty-four-hour rhythm observation was performed using a single-channel external loop recorder (ELR) configured for automated <b>AF</b> <b>detection.</b> A total of 45 patients with a known history of AF, AF on the admission ECG, or incomplete registrations were excluded. Extensive additional frequency-based settings were used to establish a reference registration. In total, 2923 recordings were transmitted. We evaluated all events, of which 1190 were designated by the device as AF. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for identifying AF using the ELR were, respectively, 93 %, 51 %, 5 %, and 99 %. Conclusions In this ELR validation study, the dedicated <b>AF</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm showed to be highly sensitive but not specific for AF. Applicability of an ELR might be limited for efficacious detection of AF, as manual verification is mandatory for a vast amount of recordings...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSeveral {{guidelines}} recommend opportunistic {{screening for}} atrial fibrillation (AF) in subjects aged ≥ 65 years using pulse palpation during routine blood pressure (BP) measurement. However, this method has limited diagnostic accuracy. A specific algorithm for <b>AF</b> <b>detection</b> during automated BP measurement {{was developed and}} implemented in a novel oscillometric device (Microlife WatchBP Home-A). In 2013, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended this device for AF screening during routine office BP measurement in primary care in subjects ≥ 65 years. A review and meta-analysis of the evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of this algorithm were performed. Six studies (n= 2332) investigated the accuracy of <b>AF</b> <b>detection</b> using the Microlife BP monitor and estimated a pooled sensitivity at 0. 98 (95 % CI 0. 95, 1. 00) and specificity 0. 92 (0. 88, 0. 96). Analysis of 4 studies (n= 1126) showed more readings to improve specificity (from 0. 86 to 0. 91) and sensitivity (from 0. 97 to 0. 99). Taking 3 sequential readings with at least 2 detecting AF gave the highest diagnostic accuracy. A single study (n= 139) of paroxysmal AF screening with home BP monitoring (3316 days) showed sensitivity 99 % and specificity 93 %. Another study (n= 46) of AF screening with 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring showed that AF detected in > 15 % of all readings has high probability of AF diagnosis requiring confirmation by 24 h electrocardiography. <b>AF</b> <b>detection</b> with routine automated BP measurement is a reliable screening tool in the elderly, which requires confirmation by electrocardiography. Paroxysmal AF might also be detected by routine automated home or ambulatory BP monitoring...|$|E

25|$|Sony has {{modified}} the DSLR formula {{in favor of}} single-lens translucent (SLT) cameras, which are still technically DSLRs, but feature a fixed mirror that allows most light through to the sensor while reflecting some light to the autofocus sensor. Sony's SLTs feature full-time phase detection autofocus during video recording as well as continuous shooting of up to 12 frame/s. The α series, whether traditional SLRs or SLTs, offers in-body sensor-shift image stabilization and retains the Minolta AF lens mount. , the lineup included the Alpha 68, the semipro Alpha 77 II, and the professional full-frame Alpha 99 II. The translucent (transmissive) fixed mirror allows 70 percent of the light to pass through onto the imaging sensor, meaning a 1/3rd stop loss light, {{but the rest of}} this light is continuously reflected onto the camera's phase <b>detection</b> <b>AF</b> sensor for fast autofocus for both the viewfinder and live view on the rear screen, even during video and continuous shooting. The reduced number of moving parts also makes for faster shooting speeds for its class. This arrangement means that the SLT cameras use an electronic viewfinder as opposed to an optical viewfinder, which some consider a disadvantage, but does have the advantage of a live preview of the shot with current settings, anything displayed on the rear screen is displayed on the viewfinder, and handles bright situations well.|$|R
40|$|Objectives Introduction of the second-trimester fetal anomaly scan and the {{decision}} to offer this scan to every woman in the 18 th- 22 nd week of pregnancy necessitates a re-evaluation of the diagnostic value of the measurement of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentrations in the amniotic fluid (<b>AF)</b> for the <b>detection</b> of neural tube defects (NTDs). Methods In this study of 6501 women who underwent amniocentesis, amniotic fluid AFP (AFAFP) concentrations were measured. The women were divided into three categories: group I, without any increased risk of fetal NTD (N = 6188); group II, with {{an increased risk of}} fetal NTD (N = 258); and group III, with a clinically diagnosed fetal NTD with known AFAFP concentrations (N = 55). Results In 27 women of group I (0. 4 %), the MOM (multiple of the median) level was > 2. 5 times the median AFP concentration for the corresponding gestational age, and in two fetuses this was related to NTD. In two pregnancies of group II (0. 8 %), an increased AFAFP was related to NTD. In group III, 44 of the 55 (80 %) samples had an increased AFAFP. Conclusion In the near future, it is likely that imaging will replace AFAFP assays for the detection of fetal NTDs because high quality ultrasound imaging will detect NTDs accurately.
