40|$|Art {{historians have}} often linked Cezanne and Picasso {{on the basis}} of formal <b>affinities</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> painting. This {{dissertation}} brings them together because of their innovative approach to the representation of the nude [...] Cezanne in his more than 230 images of male and female bathers, and Picasso in the pictures he painted in 1906 and 1907, two crucial years between the end of his so-called Rose Period and Cubism. In creating these images, the artists generally worked without live models, isolated their figures from any social or historical context, and often inscribed <b>their</b> own identities <b>in</b> <b>their</b> pictures, not as voyeurs but as disguised presences displaced onto the representation of an 2 ̆ 2 other, 2 ̆ 2 whether male or female. ^ A surprising number of these artists 2 ̆ 7 nudes are ambiguously sexed or gendered. Cezanne painted male bathers who both looked like and posed like females; Picasso mingled his own features with those of his demoiselles. I argue that the resulting ambiguities were not a side effect of stylistic considerations but a deliberate strategy that allowed the artists to dissemble their own identities, to remove their figures from any simple, direct relationship to external reality, and to represent desire as an internal, mutable force that both shapes and exceeds what is inscribed upon the visible body. In other words, it allowed them to figure sexual difference and identity [...] a question of male and female and of self and other [...] as a struggle that takes place within the psyche. ^ Cezanne and Picasso belonged to an era that had not only turned sexuality into an object of medical scrutiny but created a culture focused on desire. like their contemporary Freud, they chose to make desire the object of their investigation and they isolated and shaped that object according to emerging ideologies that divorced sexuality from anatomical considerations. I use visual analyses, the history of sexuality, and recent theories of gender and subjectivity to reveal how their ambiguous figures participated in the ideological, turn-of-the-century shift that transformed how we understand ourselves as sexed subjects [...] one that subordinated physiological and neurological understandings of sex to psychoanalytic conceptualizations of sexuality. ...|$|R

The motivation to merge these complementary groups was related to the strong <b>affinity</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> domains of research and also because it was felt to be essential that the integration, the share of resources and the increase in the critical mass could create important synergies that whould lead to relevant improvements in the research conditions and on the increase of their relative performance. The main objective of the resulting structure, CERENA, is the development of an interdisciplinary area related to the natural resources and the environment. In terms of internal structure, CERENA is organized into three groups: i) GMPG - Modelling and Processing of Georesources Group, ii) CMRP - Modelling of Petrouleum Reservoirs Group and iii) CEGEO - Geotechnics Group GMPG and CMRP occupy a large common area where the sciences and technologies used are directed to the characterization, evaluation and beneficiation of environmental and natural resources (with a predominance on mineral resources, namely petroleum), through the articulated and original use of specific methodologies (geophysics and geochemistry, geostatistics and multivariate data analysis, image analysis and pattern recognition, remote sensing and GIS, operations research, definition and control of beneficiation processes).

40|$|The hydromedusan subumbrellar muscle tissues {{originate}} from {{a mass of}} endo- and ectoderm derived cells proliferating inwardly. This mass of cells, called entocodon, is separated by the ecto-and endoderm through a layer of extracellular matrix, thus forming a locally triploblastic arrangement of tissues. By cavitation and differentiation, the entocodon {{gives rise to the}} striated and smooth muscle layers of the subumbrella. The structure of the striated muscle is histologically identical to that described for triploblasts, where striated muscle is mainly mesodermic. Together with the mode of development, this suggests that not all Cnidaria are diploblastic and that the subumbrellar cavity is a coelom-like structure. The subumbrellar cavity is formed late in ontogeny, whereas the coelom in higher animals is normally formed during embryonic development. Instead of remaining closed, the subumbrella becomes open, with the muscular mesothelium in contact with the environment. This view of cnidarian structures can be pushed further while considering the regulation of modularity and metamery. The occurrence of homeotic genes in cnidarians and other 'lower' animals shows that the specification of body architecture has a common molecular ground throughout the animal kingdom. It is suggested that the expression of homeotic genes while specifying a given architecture might be regulated by iteration of their activity, leading to 'low' modular organisms and to 'higher' metameric ones. Replicated parts as modules and metameres might be analogous, but the <b>affinity</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> molecular specification (and possibly regulation) might indicate homology. The number of resemblances between cnidarians and 'higher' metazoa suggests that this phylum might be a centre of metazoan radiation, having structures which represent the living premises of the main steps of animal evolution.

The details of andesite formation, however, remain poorly understood because the signatures of the initial arc mantle melts are often modified in the overlying crust. To distinguish initial mantle from crustal signatures in arc magmas, we studied two compositionally zoned Holocene monogenetic volcanoes, Texcal Flow and Volcan Chichinautzin, in the central Mexican Volcanic Belt (MVB). Texcal Flow and V. Chichinautzin erupt ‘ocean island basalt (OIB) -type’, high-Nb (17 – 36 ppm), olivine-phyric basalts to basaltic andesites (49 · 4 – 57 · 3 wt % SiO 2; Mg# = 68 – 50) that show an arc <b>affinity</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> major element oxides. At both volcanoes melt SiO 2 increases with time. However, systematic changes of melt SiO 2 with 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and 143 Nd/ 144 Nd, the overall low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0 · 70305 – 0 · 70453 and high 143 Nd/ 144 Nd = 0 · 51273 – 0 · 51299 relative to continental crust, and the high 3 He/ 4 He = 7 – 8 Ra of olivine phenocrysts preclude melt silica enrichment by crustal assimilation and fractional crystallization. Instead, the data require the existence of silicic initial mantle melts. The high Ni abundances of olivines suggest that the silicic melts originate from segregations of ‘reaction pyroxenites’ that formed in the peridotite mantle wedge following multiple infiltrations of silicic slab components. Sequential melting of zoned silica-deficient to silica-excess pyroxenites can reproduce the time-progressive evolution of melt silica content at Texcal Flow and V. Chichinautzin. As initial melts always have high Mg# > 70 regardless of their SiO 2 content, the low-Mg# values of the magmas erupted must reflect loss of moderate amounts (&# 60; 15 %) of olivine and possibly pyroxenes at crustal levels. Fractional crystallization and recharge mixing nearly erase all mantle signatures in the most silicic V. Chichinautzin magmas, so that their origin can only be inferred from their association with the more mafic precursory melts. The pyroxenite model implies that ∼ 15 – 18 wt % of the erupted melt mass, and possibly more, is slab-derived. We infer that the elements Fe, Mg, Ca and Ti are principally mantle-derived, whereas significant amounts of the elements Si, K, Na, P and possibly Al may be contributed from slab. As blends of mantle and slab materials, the OIB-type Texcal Flow and V. Chichinautzin magmas provide limited indication of {{the composition of the}} sub-arc mantle prior to subduction modification, which is inferred to be similar to primitive mantle, but less enriched than the sources of the intraplate magmas behind the MVB volcanic front...|$|E

40|$|AFFINITIES AND AFFILIATIONS: BLACK PACIFIC ART IN THE UNITED STATES AND AOTEAROA/NEW ZEALAND, 1948 - 2008 BERNIDA ANNE WEBB-BINDER, Ph. D. Cornell University May 2016 This {{dissertation}} employs four {{case studies}} of pioneering women and artists-Juanita Hall, Jewel Castro, Faith Ringgold, and Lonnie Hutchinson-in the United States and Aotearoa/New Zealand to theorize what I call Black Pacific art. The women, as subjects or as artists, share <b>affinities</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> portrayal of the black or brown female identity. To elucidate their mutual concerns, I analyze selected examples of visual art {{in the context of}} both African American and Pacific notions of diaspora, indigeneity, the body, and genealogy. I propose that the phenomenon of Black Pacific art is not a new one and that examples of its visual culture are embedded in a web of identity that is not imposed upon but chosen by the female subject. I provide a theoretical counterpart to Paul Gilroy's black Atlantic by utilizing the female body of color as the starting point in this critical intervention in African American and Pacific art history. This art history dissertation looks to Oceania for nuanced visual representations of blackness rather than to the usual contexts of North and South America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Europe. The dissertation outlines how the Black Pacific is a space that fosters collaborations between people of many backgrounds and describes how its art reflects what I call connections and community. The Introduction builds the historical and theoretical context of Black Pacific art. Chapter One surveys blackness from an Oceania perspective and highlights similarities and differences with other perspectives on blackness. Chapter Two concentrates on the musical South Pacific to illuminate how the African American actress Juanita Hall's black identity is erased against the backdrop of official Cold War strategies in Asia and Oceania. Chapter Three compares the intent, content, and process of Samoan American artist Jewel Castro and African American artist Faith Ringgold to outline how Castro's notions of Samoanness are prompted by Ringgold's representations of blackness. Chapter Four analyzes the signature black cut-outs and the Black Pearl video installations created by Lonnie Hutchinson (Samoan, Maori), to determine how blackness is understood and visually represented in Aotearoa/New Zealand. The conclusion projects the future of Black Pacific art. 2021 - 05 - 3...|$|R

Lee parts company from Grant, however, in his account of the holy. Lee tends to characterize the holy in Heideggerian and mystical terms, as an experience of awe unmediated by the things and creatures of the earth, as an encounter with the nothingness that surrounds all beings. For Grant, the holy is present in beings, who participate in a goodness that is primary and more fundamental than mortality. From within his more mystical understanding of the holy, Lee tends to give Grant a partial reading, obscuring Grant 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to reanimate a sense of reverence in the midst of technology. His reading also obscures an interesting tension that arises in his accounts of his own poetics and in several of his poems: against his rather mystical, Heideggerian characterization of the holy, his writing enacts a more 2 ̆ 7 rooted 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 incarnational 2 ̆ 7 sense of sacredness in the stance of justice he takes towards other beings.;Chapters One and Two focus on Lee 2 ̆ 7 s two prose accounts of Grant, noting the struggle with influence and the partiality of his reading. Chapter Three analyzes the art of Grant 2 ̆ 7 s writing, to show his efforts to reanimate a sense of reverence. Chapter Four studies Lee 2 ̆ 7 s statements of poetics, noting the competing influences of Grant and Heidegger. Chapter Five argues that Lee 2 ̆ 7 s Savage Fields: An Essay in Literature and Cosmology can be read as an effort to understand Grant 2 ̆ 7 s notion of 2 ̆ 2 the beneficence of nature. 2 ̆ 2 Chapter Six analyzes three of Lee 2 ̆ 7 s poems, tracing the tension between his nature.

40|$|This project {{analyzes}} Dante’s {{influence on}} the poetry of Thomas Stearns Eliot, Eugenio Montale, and Seamus Heaney. A comparative reading of the poetry and criticism of the four authors will display that Dante’s presence in these three modern poets’ works is of significant import, as through stylistic and thematic Dantean references, Eliot, Montale, and Heaney shape the meaning of their texts and evolve a new poetic craft. Moreover, detecting the numerous references to Dante’s work in their verses can {{shed light on the}} poetic message they want to transmit. An essential part of this project will be to establish interconnections between the works of the modern poets as well, as their decision to draw on Dante’s poetry is a major link between them and creates an <b>affinity</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> verses. This study will be divided into three sections. The first section will explore Dante’s world: his life and works, and the social, political and intellectual atmosphere he lived in. The second section deals with the stylistic influence that Dante had on Eliot, Montale and Heaney; while the third section concerns the cultural and thematic influence. The medieval master’s experiments with linguistic techniques mirror the poets’ preoccupation with language, and influence their poetic style. Eliot drew on the hellish dialectic and imagery found in Dante’s Inferno to display the lack of hope of modern civilization after the First World War. Montale’s use of the Dantean allegory, displays his tendency to describe the spiritual through the physical, and images of aridity and ruins become emblems of the human condition and of the lack of religious beliefs. Finally, Heaney is attracted to Dante’s plurilinguistic style, which allows him to transcend a mono-cultural way of making poetry, and to open to the confrontation with other traditions. The cultural influence is explored through the device of the journey towards salvation, which is the means by which artistic, social and religious issues are addressed. Common cultural experiences and affinities with Dante induce the modern authors to draw on his works. His Christian and Classical backgrounds are important features that they share with him. In addition, Dante lived in times of war and revolutions. His anxiety with the social strife in Medieval Tuscany mirrors Heaney’s concerns about the Troubles, and Eliot’s and Montale’s preoccupation with the aftermaths of World War I. However, through Dante they are able to transcend their cultural givens, as in him, they find a universal mode of making poetry that is in tune with the world they seek to attain in their lyrics. By using Dantean intertextual allusions, the poets obtain a different perspective on their own societies, and, their works, like Dante’s work, assume historical significance because they portray human life across all boundaries of time and place.

On the basis of the common types of chromosomes present among Bruguiera, two distinct groups were found; one consists of B. cylindrica and B. parviflora and the other of B. gymnorrhiza and B. sexangula. The symmetrical karyotype with same chromosome types grouped B. cylindrica and B. parviflora together and presence of Type E chromosomes placed B. gymnorrhiza and B. sexangula in a separate group, suggesting their closer <b>affinity</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> respective group. Analysis of chromosome length, volume, INV and 4 C DNA content confirmed this division. Nuclear DNA content was two-fold higher (~ 17. 0 pg) in the second group than in the first (~ 8. 0 pg). The amplification products generated through RAPD revealed 1 - 9 amplicons with size variations from 600 bp to 2 500 bp with 49. 31 % genetic similarity between B. gymnorrhiza and B. sexangula and 47. 10 % in between B. cylindrica and B. parviflora. The high copy number marker band (~ 1 100 bp) yielded in OPN- 15 primer in B. parviflora the characteristic DNA marker, which was cloned and used as probes for assessment of genetic diversity, and demonstrated its close genetic affinity to B. cylindrica. B. gymnorrhiza and B. sexangula also produced similar marker bands of ~ 600 bp and ~ 2 200 bp in the same primer. All of the cytological, 4 C DNA content and RAPD data confirmed the existence of two taxonomically distinct groups of Bruguiera: one consisting of B. cylindrica and B. parviflora and the other of B. gymnorrhiza and B. sexangula as placed earlier (1862) in the tribe Rhizophoreae by Bentham and Hooker, on the basis of the flowering habits of Bruguiera. Genetically, the B. sexangula and B. gymnorrhiza group was found to be very closely, rather than distantly, related to B. parviflora and B. cylindrica. Our results demonstrate that molecular markers together with cytological evidence provide an effective tool to access the existing interspecific genetic polymorphism in mangrove species, to solve the taxonomic problems and to design their conservation strategy.

30|$|In the {{majority}} of healthcare facilities, the routine detection of ESBL production by Enterobacteriaceae is actually carried out by phenotypic methods (Pitout and Laupland 2008). These tests {{are based on the}} principle that most ESBLs hydrolyze third-generation cephalosporins and are inhibited by clavulanic acid (Robin et al. 2008; Jarlier et al. 1988; Cormican et al. 1996; Carter et al. 2000). Most guidelines recommend to first screen isolates for decreased susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in primary susceptibility testing, and then to carry out a confirmatory test to verify ESBL production (Gazin et al. 2012; Garrec et al. 2011; Rupp and Fey 2003). However, and despite the variety of phenotypic methods available and the existence of various guidelines available for the phenotypic detection of ESBL-producing bacteria, this remains a contentious issue, and proficiency testing shows that compliance varies widely across {{different parts of the world}} (Pitout and Laupland 2008). For instance, it has been reported that laboratories fail to interpret correctly the inhibition ellipse in 30 % of cases. Indeed, the enzymes may vary <b>in</b> <b>their</b> substrate <b>affinities</b> and <b>in</b> <b>their</b> catalytic efficiencies, and also differ <b>in</b> <b>their</b> penetration rates into bacterial cells (Drieux et al. 2008). Furthermore, the emergence of AmpC β-lactamases complicates the detection of ESBL-production. Indeed, AmpC β-lactames display high resistance rate to cephalosporins without retaining any susceptibility to clavulanate (Polsfuss et al. 2011). This observation is important, considering the recent emergence of plasmidic AmpC β-lactamases species like Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp (Jacoby 2009).|$|R

Shape of seed, a character regarded to be of high diagnostic value reveals similarity to those of Iris cengialti and Iris illyrica, both closely related to I. pseudopallida, but striking dissimilarities to the latter, which has compressed seeds. Seeds of I. reichenbachii are described to be similar to those of I. orjenii. Shape and undulation of falls and standards are much more similar to I. reichenbachii, whereas no white flowered individuals from wild population of this species have been reported. White flowering plants of I. pallida from the region of Dubrovnik and white flowering individuals have been spotted occasionally in bigger populations in southern Dalmatia. A hybrid origin of I. orjenii might be suspected, the more as it is found exactly at the height where areals of I. pseudopallida and I. reichenbachii potentially overlap.Thus the closest I. orjenii population was seen only 2 km from a remote I. pseudopallida locality and I. reichenbachii is found in the immediate vicinity of all known stands of I. orjenii. The morphological homogeneity of I. orjenii and the ecological specialisation also favour exclusion of a spontaneous hybrid population hypothesis. I. orjenii is fully fertile and generative propagation in situ has been examined.The new species is restricted to humid chromic luvic cambisols in the high altimediterranean level. The eu- to supramediterranean I. pseudopallida in contrast is widespread on bare limestones or initial rendzic leptosols (Rendzina) in a variety of mediterranean and submediterranean alliances of coastal karst plains, on megacliffs in the Ephedero-Cyxthoselinetum palmoidis alliance and on montane limestone escarpments in the Campanula-Moltkeetum petaeae H-Iċ alliance.I. reichenbachii var. bosniaca and I. orjenii have strong <b>affinities</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> phytosociologial character as they are constituents of Festuco-Seslerietea Barbéro & Bonin 1969 with I. reichenbachii var. bosniaca common in Seslerietalia juncifoliae H-at and Crepedetalia dinaricae Lksic. associations on shallow rendzic leptosols of Dinaric high altitudinal limestone pastures and Pinion heldreichii alliances. But ecological differences exist as I. orjenii is never found on extremely shallow soils.Concluding from both morphology and ecology, a hybrid origin followed by speciation seems the best explanation for the restricted occurrence of I. orjenii.|$|R
40|$|AbstractElectroluminescence imaging under forward (EL) {{and reverse}} bias (ReBEL) {{has been applied}} to {{correlate}} defect distribution and breakdown sites in solar cells made of UMG-Si. An InGaAs camera system is used for luminescence detection, providing access to band-to-band and to the sub-band gap radiative transition in silicon. In contrast to previous papers the ReBEL reported here is observed only in the near-infrared (1. 25 eV - 0. 6 eV) spectral range and no visible luminescence has been detected. It is found that ReBEL intensity correlates with dark I-V characteristics. The overall distribution of breakdown sites in cells is different from the distribution of dislocations exhibiting luminescence at 0. 8 eV (grain boundaries, defects). For the first time, a spatial separation between such defects and breakdown sites is clearly established by high resolution images, giving evidence that the defects showing sub-band gap luminescence do not take part in breakdown. It is further concluded that such radiative defects reduce the <b>affinity</b> for breakdown <b>in</b> <b>their</b> vicinity...|$|R

With the increased quality requirements for these methods, it becomes more important to look at the functional sensitivities and precision profiles of the various methods. International standardization in this field is also needed. Because most sera containing human thyroid au-toantibodies display a variety of antigen-specific immuno-globulins of different classes and subclasses with different <b>affinity</b> and avidity <b>in</b> <b>their</b> epitope reaction, investigators must decide whether the autoantibodies should be quanti-fied in terms of immunoglobulin content, antigen/epitope reactivity, or binding capacity. Until these problems are solved, the best means for standardization are the Medical Research Council calibrators for TPOAb and TgAb, whereas no standardization exists for TRAb...|$|R

40|$|The {{doctrine}} of affinity {{deserves to be}} recognised by historians of chemistry as the foundational basis of the discipline of chemistry as it was practiced in Britain during the 18 th century. It attained this status through its crucial structural role in the pedagogy of the discipline. The importance of pedagogy and training {{in the practice of}} science is currently being reassessed by a number of historians, and my research contributes to this historiographical endeavour. My analysis of the variety of theories sheltered under the umbrella term ‘affinity theory’ has emphasised the role of pedagogy in influencing both the structure and the content of knowledge. I have shown that there were wide ranging discrepancies between many of the components of individual affinity theories. Nevertheless, the scope of divergence was limited. This underlying organisation resulted from the unifying hub of affinity theory, the logical common ground. This was the essence of the {{doctrine of}} affinity, encompassing the law of affinity and the conceptualisation of the table that brought together the relations described in the law. The doctrine of affinity thus provided a disciplinary common ground between chemists, providing a mediating level of understanding and communication for all those who subscribed to the doctrine of <b>affinity,</b> <b>in</b> spite of <b>their</b> detailed differences. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{hepatitis}} B virus X protein (pX) interacts {{directly with}} the bZip transactivator CREB and the bZip repressors ICERIIγ and ATF 3, increasing <b>their</b> DNA-binding <b>affinity</b> <b>in</b> vitro and <b>their</b> transcriptional efficacy <b>in</b> vivo. However, the mechanism of bZip-pX interaction and of the pX-mediated increase in the bZip transcriptional efficacy remains to be understood. In this study with deletion mutants of pX, we delineated a 67 -amino-acid region spanning residues 49 to 115 required for direct CREB, ATF 3, and ICER IIγ interaction in vitro and in vivo and increased bZip/CRE binding in vitro. Transient transfections of the pX deletion mutants in AML 12 hepatocytes demonstrate that pX 49 – 115 is {{as effective as the}} full-length pX in enhancing the ATF 3 - and ICERIIγ-mediated transrepression. However, this pX region is inactive in increasing the transactivation efficacy of CREB; additional amino acid residues present in pX 49 – 140 are required to mediate the increased transactivation efficacy of CREB in vivo. This requirement for different regions of pX in affecting CREB transactivation suggests that amino acid residues 115 to 140 integrate additional events in effecting pX-mediated transactivation, such as concomitant interactions with select components of the basal transcriptional apparatus...|$|R
40|$|PhD (Tax), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Globalisation {{of trade}} and {{investment}} has led multinational enterprises to develop strategies to maximise profits by investing in countries with a favourable tax climate, resulting in loss of tax revenue to domestic economies. In South Africa, recent economic liberalisation and associated relaxation of exchange controls have created increasing exposure to global competition, risk of capital flight and potential threat to the tax base. Heeding OECD recommendations intended to counter negative tax implications for domestic economies and curb harmful tax practices, South Africa introduced controlled foreign company provisions initially in 1997, followed by comprehensive legislation in 2001. Appropriateness of South Africa’s CFC regulations as domestic anti-avoidance measures is assessed in this study for <b>their</b> relevance <b>in</b> the international fiscal arena, highlighting key divergences, shortcomings and anomalies in the South African regulations compared with OECD recommendations, and with regulatory measures in the United Kingdom (jurisdictional-entity approach) and the United States (transactional approach), these two examplars offering paradigms {{of the most important}} CFC regulatory approaches currently in force. The primary materials investigated in the study are the statutes which constitute the taxation laws, read in conjunction with auxiliary, quasi-statutory advisory and explanatory documentation issued by the respective regulatory authorities, along with test cases that established legal precedent on points of ambiguity in taxation law. A key finding in the literature review is the relative dearth of publications on current South African CFC regulations in an international comparative context. A paradigm shift is noted in United Kingdom tax policy, as it migrates towards a territorially inclined tax system in CFC regulations – more compatible with European Union (EU) requirements and propelled in large measure by EU-pressure – with a similar trend in United States tax policy, intended to rekindle expansion and growth of the United States economy through repatriation of foreign funds earned by CFCs. The study finds that it would be unrealistic to seek an absolute paradigm for reform or evolution of South African CFC regulations in either the United Kingdom or the United States, although the South African and United Kingdom CFC measures show significant <b>affinities</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> entity-based mechanisms to grant full exemption. More significant constituents of CFC regulation in one or another of the two countries do, however, prove to be generally congenial to the South African situation and offer useful pointers for ongoing reform of the South African measures. Other areas in the United Kingdom or United States CFC regulations are identified as less relevant to South African requirements, being linked to tax principles that would be excessively complicated in the South African circumstances, needlessly demanding for tax administrators and for South African shareholders, contradictory to South African tax principles, anachronistic, or not suited for the underlying global-entity approach in the South African regulations. The research provides an updated assessment of {{the current state of the}} South African CFC regulatory measures, when seen in a broader international context, and indicates areas that could be the subject of fruitful ongoing investigation.
