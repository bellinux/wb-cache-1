5|$|By 1918, the US Department of Treasury {{called for}} all {{drinking}} water to be disinfected with chlorine. Chlorine is presently an important chemical for water purification (such as in water treatment plants), in disinfectants, and in bleach.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{effectiveness}} of English and Arabic teaching and learning the Language and Culture Center (LCC) at the State Institute for Islamic Studies Shekh Nurjati Cirebon (SIIS SNJ) based on the students ‟ perception. The study {{is to find out}} students ‟ opinion toward English and Arabic teaching and learning process and provide beneficial information for the teaching system in the LCC. This study used descriptive survey approach. The subjects were the students of English and Arabic intensive program. The data were collected through the questionnaire The results of the study are as follows. First, the teaching quality indicator is categorized <b>as</b> fairly <b>effective.</b> Second, the generic skills indicator is categorized <b>as</b> less <b>effective.</b> Third, students ‟ motivation indica-tor is categorized <b>as</b> less <b>effective.</b> Fourth, learning resources is categorized <b>as</b> not <b>effective.</b> Fifth, the assessment appropriateness is categorized <b>as</b> fairly <b>effective.</b> Sixth, the students ‟ workload is catego-rized <b>as</b> less <b>effective.</b> Seventh, the curriculum content is categorized <b>as</b> less <b>effective...</b>|$|R

It was also a system, that, unlike {{traditional}} Eastern martial-arts that required years of intensive training, could be digested by recruits relatively quickly.

5|$|Glucocorticoids {{have been}} found to be <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> as NSAIDs and may be used if {{contraindications}} exist for NSAIDs. They also lead to improvement when injected into the joint. A joint infection must be excluded, however, as steroids worsen this condition.|$|E
5|$|Several {{observational}} {{studies and}} randomized, controlled trials found metformin to be <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> and safe as insulin {{for the management}} of gestational diabetes.

5|$|The raids {{ended in}} mid-1944 on {{the orders of}} Major-General Robert Laycock, the chief of Combined Operations Headquarters.

5|$|Another {{option is}} to insert a small pellet of {{medication}} into the urethra, but this requires higher doses than injections {{and may not be}} <b>as</b> <b>effective.</b> Topical medications to dilate the blood vessels have been used, but are not very effective or well tolerated. Electrical stimulation of efferent nerves at the S2 level can be used to trigger an erection that lasts as long as the stimulation does.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin is a {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} the fever and joint-pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease. Naproxen {{has been shown to}} be <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> as aspirin and less toxic, but due to the limited clinical experience, naproxen is recommended only as a second-line treatment.|$|E
5|$|At Khe Sanh, the U.S. Marines {{held the}} high ground, and their {{artillery}} forced the North Vietnamese {{to use their}} own artillery from a much greater distance. By contrast, at Điện Biên Phủ, the French artillery (six 105mm batteries and one battery of four 155mm howitzers and mortars) was only sporadically effective;Furthermore, by 1968, the American military presence in Vietnam dwarfed that of the French, and included numerous technological advances such <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> helicopters.|$|E

40|$|Four {{studies were}} {{implemented}} {{in order to}} ascertain how men and women flirt with potential partners and which flirtatious actions are considered most effective. Study 1 (n = 40) and Study 2 (n = 60) sought to discover the actions that men and women, respectively, engage in to indicate romantic interest to a partner. Study 3 (n = 110) sought to determine which flirtatious acts from women are perceived <b>as</b> most <b>effective</b> by men. Women’s flirtations that suggest sexual access {{were expected to be}} rated <b>as</b> most <b>effective.</b> Study 4 (n = 222) sought to determine which flirtatious acts from men are perceived <b>as</b> most <b>effective</b> by women. Men’s flirtations that suggest emotional commitment and exclusivity were expected to be rated <b>as</b> most <b>effective</b> by women. The results were consistent with the hypotheses and are discussed in terms of prior research...|$|R
5|$|Finally, the Acurad system {{employed}} a patented double shot piston design. The {{idea was to}} use a second piston (located within the primary piston) to apply pressure after the shot had partially solidified {{around the perimeter of}} the casting cavity and shot sleeve. While the system was not very effective, it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines, Ube Industries, to discover that it was just <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> to apply sufficient pressure at the right time later in the cycle with the primary piston; this is indirect squeeze casting.|$|E
5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I have ever heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E
5|$|In the {{treatment}} of diabetic foot infections, linezolid appears to be cheaper and more effective than vancomycin. In a 2004 open-label study, it was <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> as ampicillin/sulbactam and Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and far superior in patients with foot ulcers and no osteomyelitis, but with significantly higher rates of adverse effects. A 2008 meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials, however, found that linezolid treatment failed as often as other antibiotics, regardless of whether patients had osteomyelitis.|$|E

5|$|Muscazone {{is another}} {{compound}} {{that has more}} recently been isolated from European specimens of the fly agaric. It {{is a product of}} the breakdown of ibotenic acid by ultra-violet radiation. Muscazone is of minor pharmacological activity compared with the other agents. Amanita muscaria and related species are known <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> bioaccumulators of vanadium; some species concentrate vanadium to levels of up to 400 times those typically found in plants. Vanadium is present in fruit-bodies as an organometallic compound called amavadine. The biological importance of the accumulation process is unknown.|$|E
5|$|NVC {{has also}} been {{reported}} <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> in reducing domestic violence. Male participants who graduated from an NVC-based batterer intervention program in California had zero percent recidivism within 5 years, according to the relevant District Attorneys' offices. The news report contrasted this with a recidivism rate of 40 percent within 5 years {{as reported by the}} Domestic Abuse Intervention Project for graduates of their batterer intervention program based on the Duluth Model, said to previously offer the lowest known domestic violence recidivism rate.|$|E
5|$|Phagocytes {{can also}} kill {{microbes}} by oxygen-independent methods, {{but these are}} not <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> as the oxygen-dependent ones. There are four main types. The first uses electrically charged proteins that damage the bacterium's membrane. The second type uses lysozymes; these enzymes break down the bacterial cell wall. The third type uses lactoferrins, which are present in neutrophil granules and remove essential iron from bacteria. The fourth type uses proteases and hydrolytic enzymes; these enzymes are used to digest the proteins of destroyed bacteria.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers have {{generally}} responded positively {{to the complexity}} of Gwen's character and Eve Myles' portrayal, though critics found fault with her more prosaic characterisation earlier on. Eve Myles' portrayal of Gwen has been cited <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> in both promoting the country of Wales and combating a perceived prejudice against the Welsh accent. Myles received a Welsh BAFTA for the first series of the show and was nominated for several other acting awards across each of Torchwoods four series'.|$|E
