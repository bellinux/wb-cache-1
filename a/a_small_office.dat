5|$|In 1954 the Japanese {{government}} merged the six villages {{surrounding the}} Residence {{into a single}} city, which was dubbed Tenri City. In the same year, the Tenrikyo central church announced {{the construction of the}} first wing of the yakata. The continuing development of the oyasato-yakata is currently overseen by a committee with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>office</b> in Tenri Seminary.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, Obama asked Lu {{to begin}} {{planning}} for a possible presidential transition. Obama warned him to tell no one about the nascent operation, even his own wife, so Lu quietly rented <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>office</b> in D.C. and secretly met with people who had worked on previous Democratic presidential transition efforts. The planning efforts produced policy options {{on a wide range}} of topics, compiled names of and began vetting potential political appointees for top jobs, arranged over 100 security clearances, and managed the logistics for expanding the operations after Election Day.|$|E
5|$|Although much {{is known}} of Little's {{investment}} activities in his adult life, {{little is known about}} his early years. Jacob Little was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts on March 17, 1794. The son of a successful local shipbuilder and of Quaker origin, Little exhibited a strong understanding of money and financial markets from an early age. In 1817 he emigrated to New York City and became a clerk in the store of Jacob Barker, a highly successful financier, merchant, and politically well-connected founding member of the Democratic Party political machine Tammany Hall. Little spent five years in apprenticeship under Barker before moving out in 1822 to start his own business with $700 he had accrued over the length of his employment. He bought <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>office</b> {{in the basement of a}} Wall Street building, which served as his base of operations for the next twelve years, before moving out of his old office to a new one in the basement of the old exchange building in 1834, from which he opened a brokerage—the start of his investment career.|$|E

5|$|Dearly Stars occurs {{prior to}} the events in The Idolmaster 2, and {{revolves}} around characters related to the talent agency 876 Production (876 Pro), a rising studio located in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>office.</b> The three main characters are Ai Hidaka, Eri Mizutani and Ryō Akizuki—three prospective pop idols introduced in Dearly Stars. In Ai's story, she is an energetic girl {{who wants to be}} an idol like her mother Mai had been, but she becomes discouraged after failing to pass several idol auditions. One of the judges at her most recent audition was 765 Production's (765 Pro) Haruka Amami, who catches up with Ai in a nearby park and decides to introduce her to 876 Pro. The president of 876 Pro, Minori Ishikawa, immediately hires Ai and wants to promote her as Mai's daughter, but Ai insists on becoming a popular idol on her own.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{together}} with Cuban dissident Armando Valladares, Bukovsky co-founded {{and was later}} elected president of Resistance International. The anti-Communist organisation was run from <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>office</b> in Paris by Soviet dissidents and emigres, notably Vladimir Maximov and Eduard Kuznetsov. In 1985 it expanded into the American Foundation for Resistance International. Among the prominent {{members of the board}} were Albert Jolis and Jeane Kirkpatrick while Midge Decter, Yuri Yarim-Agaev, Richard Perle, Saul Bellow, Robert Conquest and Martin Colman were on the body's advisory committee. The Foundation aimed to be a coordinating centre for dissident and democratic movements seeking to overturn communism in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. It organised protests in the communist countries and in the West, and opposed western financial assistance to communist governments. The Foundation also created the National Council to Support Democratic Movements (National Council for Democracy) with the goal of aiding the emergence of democratic rule-of-law governments, and providing assistance with the writing of constitutions and the formation of civil institutions.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{supporting}} characters that consistently appear throughout the episodes. Bosco is {{the proprietor of}} the nearby convenience store and supplies the Freelance Police {{with a number of}} items across the game. Driven paranoid by repeated shoplifting, Bosco is obsessed with conspiracies, believing that nearly every US government agency, as well as many criminal outfits, are after him. As such, his store is overwhelmed with security devices and contraptions created by Bosco himself. He regularly attempts to disguise himself as a variety of foreign nationals, but to little effect. Further down the neighborhood is Sybil Pandemik, who owns <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>office</b> across from Sam and Max. Sybil is unable to keep a consistent job and regularly changes her career choices. Introduced as a psychotherapist, she is noted to have worked as a tattoo artist, software tester, tabloid journalist and professional witness. In a hole in Sam and Max's own office resides Jimmy Two-Teeth, a rat who works as a petty criminal, confidence trickster and fence. He profusely dislikes Sam and Max, who he sees as always interfering with his work.|$|E

5|$|After the {{war ended}} in 1865, McKinley decided on {{a career in the}} law and began {{studying}} in the office of an attorney in Poland, Ohio. The following year, he continued his studies by attending Albany Law School in New York. After studying there for less than a year, McKinley returned home and was admitted to the bar in Warren, Ohio, in March 1867. That same year, he moved to Canton, the county seat of Stark County, and set up <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>office.</b> He soon formed a partnership with George W. Belden, an experienced lawyer and former judge. His practice was successful enough for him to buy a block of buildings on Main Street in Canton, which provided him with a small but consistent rental income for decades to come. When his Army friend Rutherford B. Hayes was nominated for governor in 1867, McKinley made speeches on his behalf in Stark County, his first foray into politics. The county was closely divided between Democrats and Republicans, but Hayes carried it that year in his statewide victory. In 1869, McKinley ran for the office of prosecuting attorney of Stark County, an office usually then held by Democrats, and was unexpectedly elected. When McKinley ran for re-election in 1871, the Democrats nominated William A. Lynch, a prominent local lawyer, and McKinley was defeated by 143 votes.|$|E

25|$|In 1956, Hiroshi Yamauchi, {{grandson}} of Fusajiro Yamauchi, visited the U.S. {{to talk with}} the United States Playing Card Company, the dominant playing card manufacturer there.

He then acquired the license to use Disney characters on playing cards to drive sales.|$|E
25|$|In {{the special}} bonus chapter, Lyra {{has a new}} dream. She was in the Town of Wish, her family was calling for her, but Lyra couldn't hear them over the sound of rushing water.

Once again, she finds herself alone in another unrecognizable place, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>office</b> in the Barge City, and looks for a magic map.|$|E

25|$|After visiting Venice and Milan, {{he spent}} {{a few days in}} Paris observing Edmund Landolt, an expert on {{diseases}} of the eye.

He opened <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>office</b> and consulting room at 2 Upper Wimpole Street, or 2 Devonshire Place as it was then. A Westminster City Council commemorative plaque is over the front door. He had no patients according to his autobiography and his efforts as an ophthalmologist were a failure.|$|E
25|$|Transaction documents—legal drafting—fall on {{a similar}} continuum. A 150-page merger {{agreement}} between two large corporations, in which both sides are represented by counsel, will be highly formal—and should also be accurate, precise, and airtight (features not always compatible with high formality). A commercial lease for a small company using <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>office</b> space will likely be much shorter and will require less complexity, but may still be somewhat formal. But a proxy statement allowing {{the members of a}} neighborhood association to designate their voting preferences for the next board meeting ought to be as plain as can be. If informality aids that goal, it is justified.|$|E
25|$|In the lead-up to 15 February, the StWC was organising {{the march}} from <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>office</b> {{donated by the}} National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education.

They planned for the two marches to merge at Piccadilly Circus and then proceed to a rally at Hyde Park.|$|E
