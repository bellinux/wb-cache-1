5|$|As enemies {{accumulate}} in the arena, {{the amount of}} safe space decreases. This, alongside the enemies' aggressive behaviour, encourages constant player movement and spatial awareness. The player character can move at high speed <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> to perform evasive manoeuvres. The game employs advanced movement techniques to increase player speed <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> height. The player can gain a speed boost by strafing while jumping. The shotgun-like blast can supplement the jumping mechanism; the player can be propelled further and perform a double jump by firing downwards while still in the air.|$|E

Sabo's CATACLYSM achieves a machinima verite style through displaying and recapturing the machinima video with a low resolution black and white hand-held video camera to produce a shaky camera effect. Other element of cinéma vérité, such as longer takes, sweeping camera transitions, <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> cuts may be included to complete the effect.|$|E

Levels are mostly composed of platforms formed by blocks. The player's goal in each level is to collect marbles, which give the player points based on their color. The exit from the level is opened once a predetermined number of points have been collected. Danny can crawl into narrow areas <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> a small height.|$|E

5|$|Similarly to Sonic Advance 1 and 2 before it, Advance 3 is a fast-paced 2D platformer. The player {{controls}} {{one of five}} characters {{simultaneously with}} a second one as a sidekick; alternately, a second player joins and one controls each character. The two characters run <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> {{through a series of}} seven levels, destroying robots along the way. The player collects rings in levels and boss battles as a form of health: upon being hit by an enemy or harmful obstacle, the player's rings will scatter and can be recollected. Being hit while carrying no rings, being crushed by an obstacle, or falling into a bottomless pit causes death; running out of lives incurs a game over screen.|$|E

After Michael falsely declares that the ship is sinking, sending the passengers into a panic and causing one passenger to grab a life vest <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> off the ship, the captain temporarily detains him by zip tying him to the railing on the deck outside.|$|E
