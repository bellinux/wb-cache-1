5|$|According to {{traditional}} sources Aisha was {{six or seven}} years old when betrothed to Muhammad, with the marriage not being consummated until she had reached puberty at the age of nine or ten years old. She was therefore a virgin at marriage. Modern Muslim authors who calculate Aisha's age based on other sources of information, such that available about her sister Asma about whom more is known, estimate that she was over thirteen <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> her late teens {{at the time of her}} marriage.|$|E
5|$|Henry and his {{new wife}} did not {{conceive}} any children, generating prurient speculation as to the possible explanation, {{and the future of}} the dynasty appeared at risk. Henry may have begun to look among his nephews for a possible heir.

Theobald of Blois, his close ally, may have also felt that he was in favour with Henry. William Clito, who was King Louis's preferred choice, remained opposed to Henry and was therefore unsuitable. Henry may have also considered his own illegitimate son, Robert of Gloucester, as a possible candidate, but English tradition and custom would have looked unfavourably on this.|$|E

Nothing is known of his life before he was exiled to Gaul, which was possibly done {{in order to ensure}} that Rædwald's own descendants ruled the kingdom. After his step-brother Eorpwald's assassination in about 627, Sigeberht returned to East Anglia <b>and</b> (<b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> the aftermath of a military campaign) became king, ruling jointly with Ecgric, who may have been either a son of Rædwald's, or his nephew.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{deficiencies}} attending a university education there was, however, {{one good thing}} about it, {{and that was the}} education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young man in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.|$|E
5|$|In 1058, Magnus headed an {{expedition}} into the Irish Sea {{that sought to}} extend Norwegian authority in the region, the Norwegians siding with a faction that opposed the Norse-Gaelic king Echmarcach mac Ragnaill. The expedition also appears to have supported {{a branch of the}} Norse-Gaelic dynasty of Ivar that opposed Irish king Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó. Magnus commanded a fleet that, in addition to Norway, recruited men from Orkney, the Hebrides, and Dublin. His forces were later active in Wales <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> England, and English chronicler John of Worcester associates the Norwegian fleet (along with the Welsh ruler Gruffydd ap Llywelyn), with returning the exiled Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia to power. The Irish Annals of Tigernach goes further in claiming that Magnus's goal was to seize power in England, but this is not supported by Welsh and English sources which also includes the Annales Cambriae and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Henry put {{his hopes}} in fathering another son. William and Matilda's mother - Matilda of Scotland - {{had died in}} 1118, and so Henry took a new wife, Adeliza of Louvain. Henry and Adeliza did not {{conceive}} any children, {{and the future of}} the dynasty appeared at risk. Henry may have begun to look among his nephews for a possible heir. He may have considered his sister Adela's son Stephen of Blois as a possible option <b>and,</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> preparation for this, he arranged a beneficial marriage for Stephen to Matilda's wealthy maternal cousin and namesake the Countess of Boulogne. Theobald of Blois, his close ally, possibly also felt that he was in favour with Henry. William Clito, the only son of Robert Curthose, was King Louis VI of France's preferred choice, but William was in open rebellion against Henry and was therefore unsuitable. Henry might have also considered his own illegitimate son, Robert of Gloucester, as a possible candidate, but English tradition and custom would have looked unfavourably on this. Henry's plans shifted when Empress Matilda's husband, Emperor Henry, died in 1125.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette's lineage {{was likely}} {{one of the}} oldest and most {{distinguished}} in Auvergne <b>and,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> <b>in</b> all of France. Males of the Lafayette family enjoyed a reputation for courage and chivalry and were noted for their contempt for danger. One of Lafayette's early ancestors, Gilbert de Lafayette III, a Marshal of France, had been a companion-at-arms of Joan of Arc's army during the Siege of Orléans in 1429. According to legend, another ancestor acquired the crown of thorns during the Sixth Crusade. His non-Lafayette ancestors are also notable; his great-grandfather (his mother's maternal grandfather) was the Comte de La Rivière, until his death in 1770 commander of the Mousquetaires du Roi, or Black Musketeers, King Louis XV's personal horse guard. Lafayette's paternal uncle Jacques-Roch died on 18 January 1734 while fighting the Austrians at Milan in the War of the Polish Succession; upon his death, the title of marquis passed to his brother Michel.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{original}} monuments in Jordan, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> the Hellenistic period in the Near East, is the village of Iraq Al-Amir in the valley of Wadi Al-Sir, southwest of Amman, which is home to Qasr Al-Abd (Castle of the Slave). Other nearby ruins include a village, an isolated house and a fountain, {{all of which are}} barely visible today due to the damage brought by a major earthquake that hit the region in the year 362. Qasr Al-Abd {{is believed to have been}} built by Hyrcanus of Jerusalem, who was the head of the powerful Tobiad family. Shortly after he began the construction of that large building, in 170 BC upon returning from a military campaign in Egypt, Antiochus IV conquered Jerusalem, ransacked a temple where the treasure of Hyrcanus was kept and appeared determined to attack Hyrcanus. Upon hearing this, Hyrcanus committed suicide, leaving his palace in Philadelphia uncompleted. The Tobiads fought the Arab Nabateans for twenty years until they lost the city to them. After losing Philadelphia, we no longer hear of the Tobiad family in written sources.|$|E

By contrast, ethnic family narratives tend to show the ethnic more in charge of his life, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> danger of losing his Jewishness altogether. Some stories show how a family member successfully negotiated the conflict between ethnic and American identities.|$|E

25|$|However, {{according}} to the conjectured gauge-gravity duality (also known as the AdS/CFT correspondence), black holes in certain cases (<b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> general) are equivalent to solutions of quantum field theory at a non-zero temperature. This means that no information loss is expected in black holes (since the theory permits no such loss) and the radiation emitted by a black hole is probably the usual thermal radiation. If this is correct, then Hawking's original calculation should be corrected, {{though it is not}} known how (see below).|$|E
25|$|Early {{examples}} of artistic expression, {{such as the}} Venus of Tan-Tan and the patterns found on elephant bones from Bilzingsleben in Thuringia, may have been produced by Acheulean tool users such as Homo erectus {{prior to the start}} of the Middle Paleolithic period. However, the earliest undisputed evidence of art during the Paleolithic period comes from Middle Paleolithic/Middle Stone Age sites such as Blombos Cave –South Africa– in the form of bracelets, beads, rock art, and ochre used as body paint <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> ritual. Undisputed evidence of art only becomes common in the following Upper Paleolithic period.|$|E
25|$|GLUD1 (glutamate {{dehydrogenase}} 1) is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme, one of {{the family}} of glutamate dehydrogenases that are ubiquitous in life, with a key role in nitrogen and glutamate (Glu) metabolism and energy homeostasis. This dehydrogenase is expressed at high levels in liver, brain, pancreas and kidney, but not in muscle. In the pancreatic cells, GLUD1 is thought to be involved in insulin secretion mechanisms. In nervous tissue, where glutamate is present in concentrations higher than in the other tissues, GLUD1 appears to function in both the synthesis and the catabolism of glutamate <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> ammonia detoxification.|$|E

25|$|His {{experiments}} are described at length over several {{articles in the}} American Journal of Science and Arts. They are light on theory, and Silliman comments that “ results are often very valuable, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps,</b> <b>in</b> some cases, not the less so, for having been sought without the direction of preconceived, theoretical views.” This is mostly true; theory enters into these articles mostly for possible explanations. However, in 1834, 15 years after his first publication on the subject, he proposes a theory of combustion that has electricity as its basic force. Hints of this theory may be visible in his first paper, but his early experiments were not guided by it.|$|E
