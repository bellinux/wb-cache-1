5|$|Once {{news of the}} {{situation}} in the Delta went public, Mississippi Governor Paul B.

5|$|Despite his {{dissatisfaction with}} McClellan's failure to {{reinforce}} Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, {{to the dismay}} of all in his cabinet but Seward. Two days after McClellan's return to command, General Robert E. Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> desperation.|$|E
5|$|Luton Town Football Club is an English {{football}} club based in Luton, Bedfordshire, which competes in League Two, the fourth tier of English football, for the 2017–18 season. Formed in 1885 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> a merger, Luton Town {{became the first}} professional team {{in the south of}} England six years later and joined the Football League in 1897. After leaving the League in 1900 because of financial difficulties, Luton Town settled at their Kenilworth Road ground in 1905 and competed in the Southern League until 1920, when the club rejoined the Football League. The team was relegated to the Football Conference in 2009, after 89 consecutive years of League membership, following a 30-point deduction imposed by the football authorities. Five seasons later, the club won promotion back to the Football League.|$|E

5|$|Modern authors like Ernesto Palacio, Norberto Galasso, and Jorge Abelardo Ramos {{attempt to}} rescue the image of Moreno by {{avoiding}} both extremes: the sweet liberal Moreno and the horrible one written by revisionists. Those historians do not consider Bernardino Rivadavia a successor of Moreno, and the proposals to seek an alliance with Britain are not seen <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> anglophilia, but just {{an example of the}} limited options available to the Primera Junta. Similarly, they do not attribute much influence to the Representation..., considering it a mere work for a client that didn't really influence Cisneros, who would have allowed free trade for international contexts. The harsh policies are acknowledged, but not attributed specifically to Moreno, but rather to the whole Junta, and compared with similar royalist measures used to punish the Chuquisaca, the La Paz revolution, and the indigenous rebellion of Túpac Amaru II.|$|E
5|$|The {{psychiatric}} incarceration {{of certain}} individuals {{was prompted by}} their attempts to emigrate, to distribute or possess prohibited documents or books, to participate in civil rights protests and demonstrations, and become involved in forbidden religious activities. The religious beliefs of prisoners, including those of well-educated former atheists who had become adherents of a religious faith, {{was considered to be}} a form of mental illness that required treatment. The KGB routinely sent dissenters to psychiatrists for diagnosing to avoid embarrassing publiс trials and to discredit dissidence <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> ill minds. Highly classified government documents which have become available after the dissolution of the Soviet Union confirm that the authorities consciously used psychiatry as a tool to suppress dissent.|$|E
5|$|The GCD of two numbers a and b is {{the product}} of the prime factors shared by the two numbers, where a same prime factor can be used {{multiple}} times, but only as long <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> these factors divides both a and b. For example, since 1386 can be factored into 2×3×3×7×11, and 3213 can be factored into 3×3×3×7×17, the greatest common divisor of 1386 and 3213 equals 63=3×3×7, the product of their shared prime factors. If two numbers have no prime factors in common, their greatest common divisor is 1 (obtained here as an instance of the empty product), in other words they are coprime. A key advantage of the Euclidean algorithm is that it can find the GCD efficiently without having to compute the prime factors. Factorization of large integers is believed to be a computationally very difficult problem, and the security of many widely used cryptographic protocols is based upon its infeasibility.|$|E

5|$|Richard {{probably}} gave York to Geoffrey in {{the hope}} of forcing him to become a full priest, and thus eliminate a potential rival for the throne. Richard also required Geoffrey to swear that he would remain outside England for three years during the time Richard expected {{to be out of the}} country on crusade. The king subsequently released Geoffrey from the oath, the initial swearing of which was apparently another of Richard's efforts to keep Geoffrey's possible ambitions towards the English throne in check. But the cathedral chapter at York disputed Geoffrey's appointment, claiming that because the Dean of York, Hubert Walter, and some others of the chapter had not been present, the election was invalid. Walter's election to York was supported by Richard's mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, whom a chronicler claimed hated Geoffrey <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> one of her husband's affairs. Richard consequently retained his control over the estates of the archbishopric, and did not confirm the election until a council held at Pipewell on 16September. At that council Richard also appointed three men to offices within the diocese of York: he made Henry Marshal the dean; Burchard du Puiset, a relative of Hugh du Puiset, became treasurer; and Roger of London the abbot of Selby Abbey. Geoffrey objected to these appointments, and as a result his estates were confiscated by the king until he submitted and became a priest. The historians Ralph Turner and Richard Heiser speculate that Richard's strategy in making these appointments was to keep Geoffrey distracted by problems within his diocese, and thus unable to challenge for the English throne. The two historians also suggest that Richard may have been making an example of Geoffrey, in a demonstration that he could be harsh even with his own relatives.|$|E

40|$|Organophosphorus {{pesticides}} (OPPs) emit {{into the}} atmosphere in both gas and particulate phases via spray drift from treatments and post-application emission, but most of their degradations in the atmosphere are not well known. In this study, the heterogeneous reactions of nitrate (NO 3) radicals with three typical OPPs (parathion, malathion, and fenthion) absorbed on azelaic acid particles are investigated using an online vacuum ultraviolet photoionization aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (VUV-ATOFMS). <b>The</b> reaction <b>products</b> observed with <b>the</b> VUV-ATOFMS are identified {{on the basis of}} GC/MS analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>products</b> in <b>the</b> reaction between NO 3 radicals and the coating of the pesticide. Paraoxon is identified <b>as</b> <b>the</b> only <b>product</b> <b>of</b> parathion; malaoxon and bis(1, 2 -bis-ethoxycarbonylethyl) disulfide <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> malathion; fenoxon, fenoxon sulfoxide, fenthion sulfoxide, fenoxon sulfone, and fenthion sulfone <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> fenthion. <b>The</b> degradation rates of parathion, malathion, and fenthion under the experimental conditions are 5. 5 x 10 (- 3), 5. 6 x 10 (- 2), and 3. 3 x 10 (- 2) s(- 1), respectively. The pathways of the heterogeneous reactions between the three OPPs and NO 3 radicals are proposed. The experimental results reveal the possible transformations of these OPPs through the oxidation of NO 3 radicals in the atmosphere. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
