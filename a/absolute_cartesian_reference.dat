40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{has been}} developed {{to solve the problem}} of mapping from (1) a glove instrumented with joint-angle sensors to (2) an anthropomorphic robot hand. Such a mapping is needed to generate control signals to make the robot hand mimic the configuration of the hand of a human attempting to control the robot. The mapping problem is complicated by uncertainties in sensor locations caused by variations in sizes and shapes of hands and variations in the fit of the glove. The present mapping algorithm is robust in the face of these uncertainties, largely because it includes a calibration sub-algorithm that inherently adapts the mapping to the specific hand and glove, without need for measuring the hand and without regard for goodness of fit. The algorithm utilizes a forward-kinematics model of the glove derived from documentation provided by the manufacturer of the glove. In this case, forward-kinematics model signifies a mathematical model of the glove fingertip positions as functions of the sensor readings. More specifically, given the sensor readings, the forward-kinematics model calculates the glove fingertip positions in a <b>Cartesian</b> <b>reference</b> frame nominally attached to the palm. The algorithm also utilizes an inverse-kinematics model of the robot hand. In this case, inverse-kinematics model signifies a mathematical model of the robot finger-joint angles as functions of the robot fingertip positions. Again, more specifically, the inverse-kinematics model calculates the finger-joint commands needed to place the fingertips at specified positions in a <b>Cartesian</b> <b>reference</b> frame that is attached to the palm of the robot hand and that nominally corresponds to the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>reference</b> frame attached to the palm of the glove. Initially, because of the aforementioned uncertainties, the glove fingertip positions calculated by the forwardkinematics model in the glove <b>Cartesian</b> <b>reference</b> frame cannot be expected to match the robot fingertip positions in the robot-hand <b>Cartesian</b> <b>reference</b> frame. A calibration must be performed to make the glove and robot-hand fingertip positions correspond more precisely. The calibration procedure involves a few simple hand poses designed to provide well-defined fingertip positions. One of the poses is a fist. In each of the other poses, a finger touches the thumb. The calibration subalgorithm uses the sensor readings from these poses to modify the kinematical models to make the two sets of fingertip positions agree more closely...|$|R

40|$|An {{understanding}} of how an initially Gaussian error volume becomes non-Gaussian over time is an important consideration for space-vehicle conjunction assessment. Traditional assumptions applied to the error volume artificially suppress the true non-Gaussian nature of the space-vehicle position uncertainties.

In this study, the impact of each assumption is examined and isolated for each point in the volume.

The term absolute in the name of this apparatus reflects the nature of the position measurement, which, unlike in a conventional electronic autocollimator, is based absolutely on the position of the image rather than on an assumed proportionality between the position and the levels of processed analog electronic signals. The term Cartesian in the name of this apparatus reflects the nature of its optical target. Figure 1 depicts the electronic functional blocks of an electronic <b>absolute</b> <b>Cartesian</b> autocollimator along with its basic optical layout, which is the same as that of a conventional autocollimator. Referring first to the optical layout and functions only, this or any autocollimator is used to measure the compound angular deviation of a flat datum mirror with respect to the optical axis of the autocollimator itself. The optical components include an illuminated target, a beam splitter, an objective or collimating lens, and a viewer or detector (described in more detail below) at a viewing plane. The target and the viewing planes are focal planes of the lens. Target light reflected by the datum mirror is imaged on the viewing plane at unit magnification by the collimating lens. If the normal to the datum mirror is parallel to the optical axis of the autocollimator, then the target image is centered on the viewing plane. Any angular deviation of the normal from the optical axis manifests itself as a lateral displacement of the target image from the center. The magnitude of the displacement is proportional to the focal length and to the magnitude (assumed to be small) of the angular deviation. The direction of the displacement is perpendicular to the axis about which the mirror is slightly tilted. Hence, one can determine the amount and direction of tilt from the coordinates of the target image on the viewing plane...|$|R

Accordingly, it will become highly complicated to derive inverse dynamics of closed-loop link systems, continuously transforming systems, or of flexible link systems. Consideration of dynamics is required to realize stable control of robotic systems, and many researchers have tried {{to deal with the}} dynamics by improving theories and methods against each system.

The scheme is developed using a finite element approach, handling the entire system as a continuum.
