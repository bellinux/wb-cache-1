25|$|The {{electricity}} {{sector in}} Colombia {{is dominated by}} large hydropower generation (65%) and thermal generation (35%). Despite the country’s large potential in new renewable energy technologies (mainly wind, solar and biomass), this potential has been barely tapped. A 2001 law designed to promote <b>alternative</b> <b>energies</b> lacks certain key provisions to achieve this objective, such as feed-in tariffs, and has had little impact so far. Large hydropower and thermal plants dominate the current expansion plans. The construction of a transmission line with Panama, which will link Colombia with Central America, is underway.|$|E
25|$|The United Kingdom Independence Party {{believed}} that the Bill was only necessary because of a failure to devise a viable plan for other sources of energy to replace fossil fuels. They considered that the Bill was 'deeply misguided', likely to cripple the economy {{and that it would}} destroy investment in alternative technologies. Instead they {{believed that}} the Government and Opposition 'need to be looking into proper alternatives like nuclear power', and that plans to invest in renewable <b>alternative</b> <b>energies</b> as wind power and solar power, as well as cutting carbon emissions by 60%, were 'unachievable and unnecessary'.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the role of}} <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> technologies in displacing fossil fuels as the world's primary energy source. To that end, a CAPM-GARCH multi-factor market model is used to investigate the relationship between returns on oil and <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> stocks. Results show that an increase in oil prices and the broad market have a statistically significant and positive impact on <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> stock returns. Furthermore, the <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> sector is substantially more risky than the broad market but {{has the potential for}} higher returns. This highlights the infancy and inherently risky nature of the <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> sector today, but demonstrates the potential for substantial future investment gain as <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> technologies become more mature and widely available. Interestingly, estimation of the <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> index model indicated the presence of abnormal returns which was not the case for the solar index model, implying that the abnormal returns were generated from a different sectoral component of the <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> index.

Oil prices and stock index of <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> sector are found independent from each other before late 2006. Contrary to existing studies, however, we find significant interdependence between oil prices and stock index of <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> industry in the recent years. Since late 2006, oil prices become significantly responsible for the stock performances of <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> companies.

The total worldwide demand for oil is more than 50% of estimated supplies and while nuclear and other <b>alternative</b> <b>energies</b> {{are trying to make}} up the difference they are coming up short. Canada is now the exclusive supplier of electricity to 15 states in the northeast after investing billions in a massive new hydro-electric power plant in Quebec. To make matters worse, a top-secret experimental sub developed by NUMA has recently discovered a stratigraphic trap, potentially the richest kind of oil deposit, which lies just across the border in the territorial waters of Quebec.|$|E

However, the expedition was cut short after Grylls suffered a broken shoulder while kite skiing across a stretch of ice. Travelling at speeds up to 50km/h (30mph), a ski caught on the ice, launching him in the air and breaking his shoulder when he came down. He had to be medically evacuated.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{voted on}} {{multiple}} occasions in 2007—2012 to block measures {{that would have}} eliminated or reduced tax breaks {{for oil and gas}} producers. For example, in January 2007, he voted against the Energy Independence and Security Act, which supporters said would have rescinded $14 billion in tax breaks for oil and gas drillers. In February 2008, he voted against the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act, which supporters said would have eliminated $18 billion in tax benefits for oil companies and substituted tax credits for wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources. In May 2008, he voted against the Energy Improvement and Extension Act, which supporters said contained provisions to cut tax breaks for oil companies and to expand tax breaks for <b>alternative</b> <b>energies</b> like solar and geothermal power, biodiesel fuels, and plug-in hybrid vehicles. In July 2010, he voted against the Consolidated Land, Energy, and Aquatic Resources Act of 2009, which would have removed federal caps on oil companies' liability for oil spills, and would have cut certain tax breaks for oil companies. In February 2011, he voted against a measure to reinstate royalties assessed for oil drilled when oil prices are high. In March, April, and May 2011, he voted against measures that would have allowed consideration of legislation to eliminate tax breaks for oil companies and promote production and use of alternative energy sources.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, Law 697, which {{promotes}} the efficient and rational use {{of energy and}} <b>alternative</b> <b>energies,</b> was promulgated. This law was regulated by Decree 3683, issued in 2003. The law and the decree contemplate important aspects such as the stimulus to education and research in renewable energy sources (RES). Nevertheless, the program created under this law lacks fundamental aspects to impulse the development of RES significantly, such as a regulatory support system to encourage investment, the definition of policies to promote renewable energy, or quantitative targets for the share of renewable energy.|$|E

The system limited the price of [...] "old oil" [...] (that which had already been discovered) while allowing newly discovered oil to be sold at a higher price to encourage investment. Predictably, old oil was withdrawn from the market, creating greater scarcity. The rule also discouraged development of <b>alternative</b> <b>energies.</b> The rule had been intended to promote oil exploration. Scarcity was addressed by rationing (as in many countries). Motorists faced long lines at gas stations beginning in summer 1972 and increasing by summer 1973.|$|E
40|$|Fossil fuels, <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> and {{economic}} growth We present a theoretical framework that incorporates energy within an endogenous growth model. The model explicitly allows for the interaction and substitution between fossil fuels, defined as a non-renewable resource derived from some fixed initial stock, and <b>alternative</b> <b>energy,</b> defined as renewable resource whose production requires capital input. The dynamics of the model depict a unique balance growth to a saddle point. The consumption path temporarily peaks, when fossil fuels are plentiful and cheap, followed by a fall, as fossil fuel become more scarce and <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> production has yet to take over, until finally the steady state is reached where <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> production fuels the entire economy. The model depicts a sort of energy heyday when fossil fuels are still plentiful and cheap. As oil stocks fall, <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> sources become ever more viable until {{the day in the}} future when <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> has almost completed replaced oil. Whether or not the “peak oil ” type picture of consumption the model depicts actually represents a sort of energy rich heyday depends analytically on the productivity differential between <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> and fossil fuels now and in the future...|$|R

40|$|In {{addition}} to promoting energy efficiency, China has actively pursued <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> {{development as a}} strategy to reduce its energy demand and carbon emissions. One area of particular focus has been to raise the share of <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> in China’s rapidly growing electricity generation with a 2020 target of 15 % share of total primary energy. Over the last ten years, China has established several major renewable energy regulations along with programs and subsidies to encourage the growth of non-fossil <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> including solar, wind, nuclear, hydro, geothermal and biomass power as well as biofuels and coal alternatives. This study thus seeks to examine China’s <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> {{in terms of what}} has and will continue to drive <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> development in China as well as analyze in depth the growth potential and challenges facing each specific technology. This study found that despite recent policies enabling extraordinary capacity and investment growth, <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> technologies face constraints and barriers to growth. For relatively new technologies that have not achieved commercialization such as concentrated solar thermal, geothermal and biomass power, China faces technological limitations to expanding the scale of installed capacity. While some alternative technologies such as hydropower and coal alternatives have been slowed by uneven and often changing market and policy support, others such as wind and solar PV have encountered physical and institutional barriers to grid integration. Lastly, all <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> technologies face constraints in human resources and raw material resources including land and water, with some facing supply limitations in critical elements such as uranium for nuclear, neodymium for wind and rare earth metals for advanced solar PV. In light of China’s potential for and barriers to growth, the resource and <b>energy</b> requirement for <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> technologies were modeled and scenario analysis used to evaluate the energy and emission impact of two pathways of <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> development. The results show that China can only meets its 2015 and 2020 targets for non-fossil penetration if it successfully achieves all of its capacity targets for 2020 with continued expansion through 2030. To achieve this level of alternative generation, significant amounts of raw materials including 235 Mt of concrete, 54 Mt of steel, 5 Mt of copper along with 3 billion tons of water and 64 thousand square kilometers of land are needed. China’s <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> supply will likely have relatively high average energy output to fossil fuel input ratio of 42 declining to 26 over time, but this ratio is largely skewed by nuclear and hydropower capacity. With successful <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> development, 32 % of China’s electricity and 21 % of its total primary energy will be supplied by <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> by 2030. Compared to the counterfactual baseline in which <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> development stumbles and China does not meet its capacity targets until 2030, <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> development can displace 175 Mtce of coal inputs per year and 2080 Mtce cumulatively from power generation by 2030. In carbon terms, this translates into 5520 Mt of displaced CO{sub 2 } emissions over the twenty year period, with more than half coming from expanded nuclear and wind power generation. These results illustrate the critical role that <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> development can play alongside energy efficiency in reducing China’s energy-related carbon emissions...|$|R
