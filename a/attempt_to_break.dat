5|$|An <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> {{the siege}} failed, with around 290 {{casualties}} out of around 415 men. Shortly afterwards, a second relief effort consisting of 225 men and three artillery guns—carried out despite specific orders {{that it should}} not take place—dispersed the forces surrounding the building, suffering two casualties, and the besieged party escaped. Only one member of the besieged group was injured.|$|E
5|$|Attalus and Sulpicius then {{attended}} {{a meeting in}} Heraclea Trachinia of the Council of the Aetolians which included representatives from Egypt and Rhodes, who were continuing to try to arrange a peace. Learning of the conference {{and the presence of}} Attalus, Philip marched rapidly south in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up the conference and catch the enemy leaders, but arrived too late.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{relations}} between Edward and Llywelyn rapidly collapsed, leading to Edward invading North Wales in 1276 in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> Llywelyn's hold on power. During the war Edward built several major castles {{in order to}} better control the region and act as bases for campaigning. Edward was successful, and the Treaty of Aberconwy in 1277 reaffirmed English dominance, dividing up most of Llwelyn's lands amongst his brothers and Edward.|$|E

5|$|The rush: If {{the prey}} {{attempts}} to flee, the wolves immediately pursue it. This {{is the most}} critical stage of the hunt, as wolves may never catch up with prey running at top speed. If their prey is travelling in a group, the wolves either <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up the herd, or isolate one or two animals from it.|$|E
5|$|Antony's fleet {{sailed through}} {{the bay of}} Actium on the western coast of Greece in a desperate <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> free of the naval blockade. It was there that Antony's fleet faced the much larger fleet of smaller, more maneuverable ships under commanders Agrippa and Gaius Sosius {{in the battle of}} Actium on 2 September 31BC. Antony and his {{remaining}} forces were spared only due to a last-ditch effort by Cleopatra's fleet that had been waiting nearby.|$|E
5|$|Australia had {{retained}} the Ashes, but England struck back at The Oval, where they posted the then-record Test score of 7/903. Early on, O'Reilly trapped Edrich lbw for 12, to secure his 100th Test wicket against England. In a timeless match, Len Hutton made {{a world record}} Test score of 364 in a fastidious and watchful innings of 13 hours, surpassing Bradman's 334. When he was on 333, O'Reilly deliberately bowled two no-balls in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> Hutton's concentration by tempting him to hit out, but the Englishman blocked them with a straight bat.|$|E

5|$|On 11 November 1975, Whitlam {{intended}} {{to call a}} half-Senate election in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the deadlock. When he went to seek Kerr's approval of the election, Kerr instead dismissed him as Prime Minister and shortly thereafter installed Fraser in his place. Acting quickly before all ALP parliamentarians {{became aware of the}} change of government, Fraser and his allies were able to secure passage of the appropriation bills, and Kerr dissolved Parliament for a double dissolution election. Fraser and his government were returned with a massive majority in the election held the following month.|$|E
5|$|On April 1 Army Group B {{found itself}} {{completely}} surrounded in the Ruhr by the U.S. First and Ninth Armies. Hitler's {{response was to}} declare the Ruhr a fortress, from which he commanded that {{there was to be}} no surrender or <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> out, in an order similar to that which he had issued at Stalingrad. He further ordered that its physical economic infrastructure – the heart of Germany's industrial power – be destroyed by Army Group B to prevent it falling into Allied hands. Model ignored these instructions.|$|E
5|$|Operating as {{the extreme}} {{southern}} {{flank of the}} Pusan Perimeter, the US Army's 25th Infantry Division placed its regiments around the South Korean city of Masan, with the US 24th Infantry Regiment and 5th Regimental Combat Team based in Haman and nearby Sobuk-san, and the US 35th Infantry Regiment based along the Nam River {{to the west of}} the city. Throughout the six-week battle, the Korean People's Army 6th and 7th Divisions attacked the 25th Division's regiments in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through the UN forces and attack Pusan.|$|E

5|$|The 25 May saw {{the first}} major Soviet <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the encirclement. German Major General Hubert Lanz {{described}} the attacks as gruesome, made en masse. By 26 May, the surviving Red Army soldiers were forced into crowded positions {{in an area of}} roughly fifteen square kilometers. Soviet attempts to break into the German encirclement from the east were continuously blocked using tenacious defensive manoeuvres and German air power. Groups of Soviet tanks and infantry that attempted to escape and succeeded in breaking through German lines were caught and destroyed by Ju 87s from StG 77.|$|E
5|$|The NK 2nd Division {{made a new}} effort {{against the}} 23rd Infantry's {{perimeter}} in the predawn hours of September 8, in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through eastward. This attack, launched at 02:30 and heavily supported with artillery, penetrated F Company. It was apparent that unless F Company's position could be restored the entire regimental front would collapse. When all its officers became casualties, First Lieutenant Ralph R. Robinson, adjutant of the 2nd Battalion, assumed command of the company.|$|E
5|$|The first Allied <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> {{through the}} Gustav Line in the Battle of Monte Cassino in January 1944 met with early success, with the British X Corps {{breaking}} through the line held by the 94th Infantry Division and imperilling the entire Tenth Army front. At the same time, Kesselring was receiving warnings of an imminent Allied amphibious attack at Anzio. Kesselring rushed his reserves, the 29th and 90th Panzergrenadier Divisions, to the Cassino front. They were able to stabilise the German position there but left Rome poorly guarded.|$|E

By 12:00, North Korean troops were attacking the 99th and 61st Field Artillery Battalions which were supporting the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, indicating that the North Korean infiltration had been extensive by that point.|$|E
5|$|After 1347, John VI Kantakouzenos {{tried to}} revive the Empire, but met with limited success. Aided by the {{depopulation}} brought by about by the Black Death, Dušan and his general Preljub took Kantakouzenos' Macedonian strongholds as well as Epirus and Thessaly in 1347–1348, thereby completing their conquest of the remaining Byzantine lands in mainland Greece. An <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> Byzantium's dependence for food and maritime commerce on the Genoese merchants of Galata led to a Byzantine–Genoese war, which ended in 1352 with a compromise peace. In 1350, Kantakouzenos took advantage of Dušan's preoccupation with a war against Bosnia to recover Thessalonica from the Zealots as well as Berroia, Vodena and other Macedonian cities from the Serbs, but the Serbian emperor quickly reversed the Byzantine gains, leaving only Thessalonica in Byzantine hands.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in the}} 2010 outdoor season, Bolt ran 19.56 {{seconds in}} the 200 m in Kingston, Jamaica for the fourth-fastest run of all-time, {{although}} he stated {{that he had no}} record breaking ambitions for the forthcoming season. He took to the international circuit May with wins in East Asia at the Colorful Daegu Pre-Championships Meeting and then a comfortable win in his 2010 IAAF Diamond League debut at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix. Bolt made an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> Michael Johnson's best time over the rarely competed 300 metres event at the Golden Spike meeting in Ostrava. He failed to match Johnson's ten-year-old record of 30.85 and suffered a setback in that his 30.97-second run in wet weather had left him with an Achilles tendon problem.|$|E

5|$|Gilroy {{spent several}} years trying to write a plot that would fit the setting, and experimented with conspiracies and murder mysteries as central story elements. Eventually, he decided to instead start by {{designing}} the characters, and attempted to create a standard literary hero character. Unable to create an interesting hero, he then envisioned an antihero as the lead character. Gilroy felt antiheros were a rarity in films, because they are difficult to write, and usually devolve into psychopaths; in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> from the stereotype, he thought of writing an antihero success story. Several films, including The King of Comedy (1983), To Die For (1995), and The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), were used as research on how to write antiheroes.|$|E
5|$|Marshall was {{a strong}} {{opponent}} of Indiana's recently passed eugenics and sterilization laws, and ordered state institutions not to follow them. He was an early, high-profile opponent of eugenics laws, and he carried his opposition into the vice-presidency. His governorship {{was the first in}} which no state executions took place, due to his opposition to capital punishment and his practice of pardoning and commuting the sentences of people condemned to execution. He regularly attacked corporations and used recently created anti-trust laws to <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> several large businesses. He participated in a number of ceremonial events, including personally laying the final golden brick to complete the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1909.|$|E

Instead, the Authority offered Lesnar a contract to face anyone else at WrestleMania. They were interrupted by a returning Undertaker, who confronted Lesnar. While Lesnar signed the contract for a match at WrestleMania with The Undertaker as his opponent, The Undertaker accepted Lesnar's challenge by stabbing Lesnar with a pen and chokeslamming him through a table. This set up a match where Lesnar would <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the Undertaker's 21–0 undefeated streak at WrestleMania.|$|E
