5|$|In this episode, flashbacks reveal why Hurley is {{hesitant}} {{at his new}} job of distributing food {{found in}} the newly discovered Swan station. Meanwhile, a few castaways become worried that the raft sent by them for rescue may have not gone <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> hoped. Jack and Sayid explore the hatch, while Sawyer, Jin, and Michael find out that their captors are from the tail section of the plane..|$|E
5|$|Team Ninja {{kept working}} on the Ninja Gaiden project after its release, {{with the aim of}} pushing the action genre and their first such title <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could. To this end, they {{released}} downloadable expansions, known as Hurricane Packs, free of charge. Itagaki said that since the packs were born out of his team's interest, they did not care to charge players for their efforts. The two packs were available over Xbox Live {{in the third quarter of}} 2004.|$|E
5|$|While Strez's murder meant {{an end to}} the Latin–Bulgarian campaign, Stefan did not {{undertake}} a campaign into Macedonia due to the proximity of the coalition troops, which had halted at Niš. In 1217, all of Strez's territory was under the Epirote rule of Theodore Komnenos Doukas, though Boril may have controlled some or all of it in the meantime. The Serbs failed to take advantage of Strez's death <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> did not manage to acquire any of his former domains.|$|E
50|$|Magnum's lawyers {{realised}} {{the mistake}} the following day, and contacted Viko's lawyers to notify {{them of the}} error, offering to immediately refund the cheque, and even go <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> suggest <b>they</b> cancel the cheque.|$|R
50|$|Railmotor {{services}} {{began in}} 1905 and several new halts were built. Running from Silverdale <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Trentham, <b>they</b> {{were intended to}} compete with trams and were somewhat successful in this respect, although they only lasted until 1926.|$|R

25|$|Based on {{the fact}} that Category Three {{officials}} represented by both the SRFA and the Scottish Association of Referees (SAR) had not been represented at the strike meeting, the SSFRA informed them on 23 November that <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were concerned, they were at liberty to choose whether or not they accepted appointments for the weekend.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately for the Dynamo, {{that would}} be <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> would go. After an uninspired draw at home against Sporting Kansas City, the future champions, the Dynamo would fall 2–1 to Sporting on the return leg in Kansas. However, 2013 would still be {{considered}} another {{in a long line}} of successes for the Dynamo, and the team had their core players all locked into long-term contracts for the future.|$|E
50|$|In Japan, {{the species}} {{can be found}} in Hakone, Miyanoshita and <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Sapporo. <b>They</b> prefer various moss and rotten stumps or trees where they are abundant. The species were also found in the city Hakodate of Hokkaido.|$|R
50|$|When railmotors were {{introduced}} on GWR branches, {{they worked on}} these lines <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Tavistock. <b>They</b> were replaced later with class 517 type engines fitted for auto-train working. From the 1920s the 45XX and 44XX type were dominant.|$|R

25|$|Miike has {{garnered}} international notoriety for depicting shocking {{scenes of}} extreme violence and sexual perversions. Many {{of his films}} contain graphic and lurid bloodshed, often portrayed in an over-the-top, cartoonish manner. Much of his work depicts the activities of criminals (especially yakuza) or concern themselves with gaijin, non-Japanese or foreigners living in Japan. He {{is known for his}} dark sense of humor and for pushing the boundaries of censorship <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> will go.|$|E
25|$|In fact, no {{decision}} on an approach (much less multiple approaches) had been made. Federal officials said on September 7, 1931, {{that there were}} no Arlington County approaches, and <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could ascertain none would be open in 1932, either. A road from the bridge south down Columbia Island and a bridge over the Boundary Channel to connect with the Mount Vernon Memorial Parkway would open in late 1931 or early 1932, they said. But that was the only work foreseen.|$|E
25|$|The Director of the Serious Fraud Office {{has decided}} to {{discontinue}} {{the investigation into the}} affairs of BAE Systems plc <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> relate to the Al Yamamah defence contract. This decision has been taken following representations that have been made both to the Attorney General and the Director concerning the need to safeguard national and international security. It has been necessary to balance the need to maintain the rule of law against the wider public interest. No weight has been given to commercial interests or to the national economic interest.|$|E
30|$|Second, the Doreans, a mountainous race entered {{from western}} Macedonia, and {{following}} the main mountain range went down <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Peloponessos. <b>They</b> also converted large areas of forests to grasslands for the same reason, using the most effective tool, burning.|$|R

50|$|The Erythrinidae are {{a family}} of fishes found in rivers and other {{freshwater}} habitats from Costa Rica south <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Argentina. <b>They</b> are common and are caught with hooks by fishermen, partially because of their voracious behaviour. They are sometimes called trahiras or tarariras.|$|R
25|$|Of {{the ships}} departing on December 8, 32 Acadian {{families}} (225 prisoners) {{on board the}} British ship Pembroke, bound for North Carolina, seized control of the vessel. On February 8, 1756, the Acadians had sailed up the Saint John River <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could. The Acadians disembarked and burned their ship. A group of Maliseet met them and directed them upstream, where they joined an expanding Acadian community. The Maliseet took them to one of Charles Deschamps de Boishébert et de Raffetot's refugee camps for the fleeing Acadians, which was at Beaubears Island.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of what we}} {{know about}} Columbanus is based on Columbanus' own works (<b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> have been preserved) and Jonas of Bobbio's Vita Columbani (Life of Columbanus), which was written between 639 and 641. Jonas entered Bobbio after Columbanus' death but relied on reports of monks who still knew Columbanus. A {{description}} of miracles of Columbanus written by an anonymous monk of Bobbio is of much later date. In the second volume of his Acta Sanctorum O.S.B., Mabillon gives the life in full, together with an appendix on the miracles of the saint, written by an anonymous member of the Bobbio community.|$|E
25|$|These three princely houses {{produced}} {{nearly all}} Kings of Cashel from the 5th to the 10th centuries. Some were strong, others were renowned bishops and scholars, {{and others were}} weak. The importance of the Cashel kingship was primarily ceremonial, and rulers were with the occasional exception not militarily aggressive, although they continually strove for political dominance <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could with the province's wealth. Strong petty kingdoms regarded as subject would receive large payments called rath {{in return for their}} acknowledgment of the political supremacy of Cashel, and they would sometimes give hostages as well. The most powerful petty kingdoms exchanged hostages with the King of Cashel, and though subject in some sense (by agreement), they were legally free and capable of terminating the contract.|$|E
50|$|Although its {{antecedent}} institutions go back <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> 1893, <b>they</b> took new shapes {{from the}} 1960s, {{creating a new}} University focused on practice-oriented education with strong links to industry, the professions and the community, and with a growing research reputation and {{a strong commitment to}} internationalisation.|$|R
50|$|In 376 BC, a large band of Triballi under King Hales crossed Mount Haemus and {{advanced}} <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Abdera; <b>they</b> had backing from Maroneia and {{were preparing to}} besiege the city when Chabrias appeared off the coast, with the Athenian fleet, and organized a reconciliation.|$|R
60|$|She {{had left}} the house early: {{accompanied}} by Pétronelle, she had been rowed along the river <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Suresnes. <b>They</b> had brought some bread and fresh butter, a little wine and fruit in a basket, and from here she meant to wander homewards through the woods.|$|R
25|$|The {{bombing was}} so dense that it caused a city fire {{spreading}} eastwards, {{driven by the}} wind, over the south of Friedrichstadt and the northwest of neighboured Luisenstadt. The fire lasted for four days until it had burnt everything combustible in its range to ashes and after it had reached waterways, large thoroughfares, and parks that the fire could not jump over. Due to the exhaustion of German supplies the German anti-aircraft defense was under-equipped and weak so {{that out of the}} 1,600 US aircraft committed, only 36 were shot down and their crews – <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> survived the crash of their planes – taken as prisoners-of-war. First Air Division commander Lt. Col. Rosenthal was among those shot down and survived, but was rescued by the Soviet armed forces and eventually returned to England.|$|E
25|$|On September 13, the Athenians left camp {{leaving their}} wounded behind and their dead unburied. The survivors, {{including}} all the non-combatants, numbered 40,000, {{and some of the}} wounded crawled after them <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could go. As they marched they defeated a small Syracusan force guarding the river Anapus, but other Syracusan cavalry and light troops continually harassed them. Near the Erineus river, Demosthenes and Nicias became separated, and Demosthenes was attacked by the Syracusans and forced to surrender his 6,000 troops. The rest of the Syracusans followed Nicias to the Assinarus river, where Nicias's troops became disorganized in the rush to find drinking water. Many Athenians were trampled to death and others were killed while fighting with fellow Athenians. On {{the other side of the}} river a Syracusan force was waiting, and the Athenians were almost completely massacred, by far the worst defeat of the entire expedition in terms of lives lost. Nicias personally surrendered to Gylippus, hoping the Spartan would remember his role in the peace treaty of 421. The few who escaped found refuge in Catana.|$|E
25|$|His {{attitude}} toward the Kabbalah is determined by his conservative standpoint. Its elements, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> {{can be traced back}} to the Talmud, he considered to be true. When the inhabitants of Fez made inquiries regarding the proportions of God, he answered, as one of the signers of the responsum, that God is above any corporeal qualification and that the Talmud forbids the public discussion of these things. His answer to the question regarding the interpretation of the Talmudic tradition that four men entered paradise is interesting, and has caused much discussion. He refers to the opinion of various scholars that specially favored persons could attain, by means of castigation and the reciting of psalms, to an ecstatic state in which they might behold the heavenly halls ("hekalot") as vividly as if they really had entered them. Contrary to his father-in-law, Samuel ben Hofni, gaon of Sura, he followed former scholars in deeming it not impossible that God should reveal the marvels of heaven to the pious while in this state of ecstasy. But all the elements of the later Kabbalah not found in Talmudic tradition, as the belief that miracles could be performed with the names of God, he designated as foolishness not credited by any sensible man.|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of any {{national}} park service in administering natural areas is to maintain an area’s ecosystems in as nearly pristine a condition as possible. This means that ecological processes, including plant succession and the natural regulation of animal numbers, {{should be permitted to}} proceed <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> possible <b>as</b> <b>they</b> did under pristine conditions, and that modern man must be restricted to generally non-consumptive uses of these areas (Houston 1971). </p...|$|R
50|$|In therapy, the counterdependent {{personality}} often {{wishes to}} flee treatment, {{as a defense}} against the possibility of regression. By keeping the therapist at arm's length, and avoiding reference to feelings <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> possible, <b>they</b> may attempt to control the therapist so as to preserve their sense of independence.|$|R
60|$|After {{an unusually}} quick passage across the Channel, the {{travelers}} {{landed on the}} French coast, before the defeated spy had returned from London to Dartford by stage-coach. Continuing their journey by post <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Amiens, <b>they</b> reached that city in time to take their places by the diligence to Paris.|$|R

500|$|In February 2011, Cavallari told Access Hollywood {{that the}} cast {{followed}} a [...] "schedule" [...] of events to be filmed {{on a given}} day, adding, [...] "We only filmed The Hills three days a week, and we did three different scenes each day and {{a change of clothes}} to film a specific scene [...] They were pushing it <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could go without an actual script... They give you a schedule like, 'You have lunch with Heidi [...] at 3 to talk about the party coming up' or whatever the situation may be". She had earlier commented that she felt viewers [...] "need to understand it's all entertainment" [...] and she [...] "would never put [...] close friends or a real relationship on a show".|$|E
500|$|By [...] "traditional power", Russell has in {{mind the}} ways in which people will appeal to the force of habit to justify a {{political}} regime. It is in this sense that traditional power is psychological and not historical; since traditional power is not entirely based on a commitment to some linear historical creed, but rather, on mere habit. Moreover, traditional power need not be based on actual history, but rather be based on imagined or fabricated history. Thus he writes that [...] "Both religious and secular innovators – at any rate those who have had most lasting success – have appealed, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could, to tradition, and have done whatever lay in their power to minimise the elements of novelty in their system." [...] (Russell 1938:40) ...|$|E
60|$|The {{rain had}} now ceased completely, {{and soon they}} were leading their horses forward as before. It was very wet in the {{brushwood}} and, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> possible, <b>they</b> kept to the open spaces. The outlook was certainly a dismal one, and the boys felt in anything but a good humor.|$|R
5000|$|Peter {{had also}} {{followed}} the early Fourth Crusade, with Guy, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> Zara, Dalmatia. <b>They</b> joined Simon perhaps in 1210, and Peter likely knew Simon personally.|$|R
