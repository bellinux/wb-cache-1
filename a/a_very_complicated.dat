This method results in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>complicated</b> set of equations in multiple dimensions, which are costly to solve.

Based on similar seismic velocity gradients of the lavas of the Carnegie, Cocos and Malpelos Ridges there is evidence that the hotspot activity has been the result of a single long mantle melt rather than multiple periods of activity and dormancy.|$|E

25|$|PEM {{systems that}} use {{reformed}} methanol were proposed, as in Daimler Chrysler Necar 5; reforming methanol, i.e. making it react to obtain hydrogen, is however <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>complicated</b> process, that requires also purification from the carbon monoxide the reaction produces. A platinum-ruthenium catalyst is necessary as some carbon monoxide will unavoidably reach the membrane. The level should not exceed 10 parts per million. Furthermore, the start-up times {{of such a}} reformer reactor are of about half an hour. Alternatively, methanol, and some other biofuels can be fed to a PEM fuel cell directly without being reformed, thus making a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). These devices operate with limited success.|$|E
25|$|Another way {{ergodicity}} can {{be broken}} is by the existence of nonlinear soliton symmetries. In 1953, Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and Tsingou conducted computer simulations of a vibrating string that included a non-linear term (quadratic in one test, cubic in another, and a piecewise linear approximation to a cubic in a third). They found that {{the behavior of the}} system was quite different from what intuition based on equipartition would have led them to expect. Instead of the energies in the modes becoming equally shared, the system exhibited <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>complicated</b> quasi-periodic behavior. This puzzling result was eventually explained by Kruskal and Zabusky in 1965 in a paper which, by connecting the simulated system to the Korteweg–de Vries equation {{led to the development of}} soliton mathematics.|$|E

When asked about the chant for clarification, Zimmer said, [...] "The chant became <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>complicated</b> thing because I wanted hundreds of thousands of voices, and it's not so easy to get hundreds of thousands of voices.

500|$|The Times {{said it was}} [...] "a very Sparksian {{undertaking}} – painstaking {{and slightly}} ludicrous – to make a musical about an art-house film director, with <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>complicated</b> plot, for the radio (even Rick Wakeman's King Arthur on Ice had something to look at)." [...] It said the orchestral arrangements by Ron Mael were [...] "great, actually, recalling the skyscraper bustle of Bernstein and the triumphant fanfares of Michael Nyman", and stated that [...] "the central concept – pursue your own idea of art, regardless of whether anyone will buy it – seems to be their rule of thumb, too. And you can't knock that." [...] The review by Stephen Dalton, also in The Times, found the [...] "modernist musical backdrop" [...] dominated by [...] "electro-orchestral fragments" [...] "less seductive" [...] and, [...] "despite plenty of arch and witty lyrics", regretted the scarcity of [...] "memorable melodies or fully realised songs".

Speaking about the post-production process in January 2016, the Russo brothers said, [...] "This has been the easiest post process we've ever had on a film. We're very happy with how the movie was. Everyone is very happy with where the movie was. For us, the tricky thing is the effects because it's <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>complicated</b> movie and there are some really big sequences in the film. The effects are on a much larger scale than the work we did on Winter Soldier. That's the part that becomes really difficult because you don't have a lot of time and everyone has very high standards.

500|$|... "Half-Decent Proposal" [...] was {{animated}} in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>complicated</b> manner. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, director MacMullan {{stated that}} a couple of sequences in the episode were [...] "reaching too far" [...] for the animation process to be [...] "reassembled correctly". One example, she mentioned, is the scene in which Marge remembers Ziff's assault from [...] "The Way We Was". Ziff's assault is shown as hands reaching for Marge, and was put together by MacMullan in post-production. Right after Marge's sisters Patty and Selma send an e-mail to Ziff, the e-mail's path is elaborately shown through a [...] "trip through the computer wires". MacMullan stated that, even though she found the scene [...] "illogical", she maintained that it was [...] "done with great effort". Because the characters at Ziff's prom had to wear 1970s styled wardrobe, the animators {{had to come up with}} new designs for the character's clothes. Several of the designs were pitched and drawn by Ron Hauge, a former Simpsons writer who was responsible for coordinating character designs on the series for many years. The dance that Ziff performs at the prom was pitched by MacMullan, and the prom locale was drawn using a photo reference. A scene in the episode shows Homer and Lenny signing on to become oil workers. The manager who hands them a paper clip can be seen smoking, and originally, MacMullan suggested that the manager [...] "puts his lit cigarette out in the [...] can , and blows his other arm off." [...] She pitched the idea to Jean, who responded by writing [...] "I wouldn't." [...] The episode's complicated and lengthy animation process was so strenuous that it led the Simpsons animators to start calling MacMullan [...] "Lauren MacMultiplane".|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{humanoid}} robot {{is a combination}} of biped, intelligent and mimetic robot to serve human beings in non-production sectors. Since it is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>complicate</b> automatic walking and working machinery, and it works interactively with people in daily life, its correctness and reliability in terms of its functions and performances need to be checked intensively after final assemble and before it is shipped.
