A law that would have obligated every politician to declare three things: make an obligatory public patrimonial declaration, interests declaration, and fiscal.

A light version of the law was accepted but it doesn't require politicians to declare {{on any of the}} instances stated above. While it was completely legal for Baltazar and the other deputies from the PRI, to vote against such law, some news media outlets interpreted the votes against the promulgation of such law as the political party protecting itself from the findings that could surface if such declarations were to be made.|$|E

To estimate this vital parameter econometrically, we use a set of French business data compiled from standard corporate income tax returns (Bénéfices Réels Normaux) and employers <b>annual</b> <b>declarations</b> of payroll data (Déclarations Annuelles de Données Sociales). These data provide information on the stock of tangible fixed assets in the office equipment, furniture, and IT categories. We developed our measure of IT capital from this fixed-asset item. Our results suggest an IT capital elasticity of production of 0. 9 %, substantially above the 0. 5 % share of return on IT capital in production. Various robustness tests corroborate this result, which seems due to the likely existence of excess return on IT capitala quantity that cannot be measured with the traditional growth-accounting method.

However, despite <b>annual</b> <b>declarations</b> on the Turkish side that each new {{year would be}} ‘the year of the EU’, negotiations seem to be progressing very slowly and the prospects for their timely completion look dim. In fact, with 18 chapters {{out of the picture}} due to a variety of obstacles and the blocking of the provisional closure of any chapters until Turkey fulfils its obligations deriving from the Additional Agreement, the situation looks grim indeed. The first aim {{of this paper is to}} provide the necessary background for placing the {{accession negotiations}} with Turkey within the proper context. To accomplish this, it first provides an overview of EU-Turkish relations, starting with Turkey’s initial application to become a member of the EEC. The overview aims to help put things into perspective by providing an account of relations from the start, including the establishment of a Customs Union between Turkey and the EU. Secondly, the course of the negotiations themselves will be analysed, along with the reasons for the current impasse. In this section, the focus will not be to put the blame on one side or the other but rather to provide a list of the problems contributing to the deadlock. The section will also look into the deeper underlying issues...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Federal {{disaster}} {{assistance is}} {{one component of}} U. S. policy for coping with damaging floods. The president ultimately determines whether or not federal relief is provided to states and local communities following a disaster. Yet, guidelines governing the president’s discretion are vague and the total federal cost of disaster assistance {{is extremely difficult to}} determine. This study analyzes flood-related presidential disaster declarations from 1965 to 1997. It compares the annual number of flood-related declarations to measures of precipitation and flood damage, finding that presidents have differed significantly in disaster <b>declaration</b> policy. <b>Annual</b> differences in <b>declarations</b> during seven presidential administrations do not correspond to the president’s political party affiliation. In addition, a state’s ability to pay has not been a major consideration in presidential decisions about whether a disaster warrants federal assistance. However, presidential decisions are related {{to whether or not the}} president is running for reelection. Declarations are also related to changes in legislative and administrative policy. This paper discusses the significance of these findings in the context of national policies governing floods and other disasters...|$|R
