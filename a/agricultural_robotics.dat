40|$|Cropping fields {{often have}} {{well-defined}} poor-performing patches due to {{spatial and temporal}} variability. In an attempt to increase crop performance on poor patches, spatially selective field operations may be performed by <b>agricultural</b> <b>robotics</b> to apply additional inputs with targeted requirements. This paper addresses the route planning problem for an agricultural robot that has to treat some poor-patches in a field with row crops, {{with respect to the}} minimization of the total non-working distance travelled during headland turnings and in-field travel distance. The traversal of patches in the field is expressed as the traversal of a mixed weighted graph, and then the problem of finding an optimal patch sequence is formulated as an asymmetric traveling salesman problem and solved by the partheno-genetic algorithm. The proposed method is applied on a cropping field located in Northwestern China. Research results show that by using optimum patch sequences, the total non-working distance travelled during headland turnings and in-field travel distance can be reduced. But the savings on the non-working distance inside the field interior depend on the size and location of patches in the field, and the introduction of <b>agricultural</b> <b>robotics</b> is beneficial to increase field efficiency...|$|E

The aim is to build an accurate, fast and reliable fruit detection system, which is a vital element of an autonomous <b>agricultural</b> <b>robotic</b> platform; it {{is a key element}} for fruit yield estimation and automated harvesting. Recent work in deep neural networks has {{led to the development of}} a state-of-the-art object detector termed Faster Region-based CNN (Faster R-CNN).

In addition to improved accuracy, this approach is also much quicker to deploy for new fruits, as it requires bounding box annotation rather than pixel-level annotation (annotating bounding boxes is approximately an order of magnitude quicker to perform).

40|$|Automation {{technology}} in agriculture is growing, making <b>agricultural</b> <b>robotics</b> viable. Innovative field usable multi-purpose robotic platforms {{are needed for}} the successful progression of <b>agricultural</b> <b>robotics.</b> Furthermore, the field of <b>agricultural</b> <b>robotics</b> would benefit from a robotic platform design allowing for variable height, thus accommodating navigation throughout various crop growth stages. A variable height machine, Flex-Ro was developed to accommodate this feature. Multiple sub-assemblies were designed and implemented for Flex-Ro. An electronic control unit (ECU) enabled engine was used to power Flex-Ro. An embedded application program was developed to control engine speed using proprietary Controller Area Network (CAN) messages in conjunction with J 1939 standard messages. It was observed that the maximum standard deviation from the requested set speed was 8. 423 rpm. A hydrostatic transmission system was designed and implemented on Flex-Ro. An embedded application program was developed for controlling the pumps and motors of the hydrostatic transmission utilizing proprietary CAN messages. Additionally, the embedded controller operated a Control Cut Off (CCO) that regulated flow to the spring applied motor brakes and the Electronic Displacement Control (EDC) which controls pump flow. Based on the motor speed data collected, {{it was observed that}} an increase in deviation occurred as the operational speed increased with a minimum standard deviation of 6. 98 rpm at 50 RPM and a maximum standard deviation of 36. 13 rpm at 156 RPM. The measured data should be used in developing further higher level control programs. A vertically adjustable frame was developed to allow Flex-Ro to enter crops at various growth stages. A steering system was developed and programmed to allow for steering control through the CAN bus again using proprietary CAN messages. Lastly, a remote control program was developed to allow messages to be created and wirelessly transmitted to Flex-Ro’s CAN bus for teleoperation. Sub-assemblies of Flex-Ro will be further developed for fully autonomous navigation, and performing various field operations. Advisor: Santosh Pitl...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{the domain}} of <b>agricultural</b> <b>robotics,</b> one major {{application}} is crop scouting, e. g., for the task of weed control. For this task a key enabler is a robust detection and classification of the plant and species. Automatically distinguishing between plant species is a challenging task, because some species look very similar. It is also difficult to translate the symbolic high level description of the appearances and {{the differences between the}} plants used by humans, into a formal, computer understandable form. Also {{it is not possible to}} reliably detect structures, like leaves and branches in 3 D data provided by our sensor. One approach to solve this problem is to learn how to classify the species by using a set of example plants and machine learning methods. In this paper we are introducing a method for distinguishing plant species using a 3 D LIDAR sensor and supervised learning. For that we have developed a set of size and rotation invariant features and evaluated experimentally which are the most descriptive ones. Besides these features we have also compared different learning methods using the toolbox Weka. It turned out that the best methods for our application are simple logistic regression functions, support vector machines and neural networks. In our experiments we used six different plant species, typically available at common nurseries, and about 20 examples of each species. In the laboratory we were able to identify over 98 % of these plants correctly. Keywords-plant classification; supervised learning; 3 D laser sensor; <b>agricultural</b> <b>robotics</b> I...|$|E

40|$|Autonomous {{agricultural}} robots {{have experienced}} rapid development {{during the last}} decade. They are capable of automating numerous field operations such as data collection, spraying, weeding, and harvesting. Because of the increasing demand of field work load and the diminishing labor force on the contrary, {{it is expected that}} more and more autonomous agricultural robots will be utilized in future farming systems. The development of a four-wheel-steering (4 WS) and four-wheel-driving (4 WD) robotic vehicle, AgRover, was carried out at <b>Agricultural</b> Automation and <b>Robotics</b> Lab at Iowa State University. As a 4 WS/ 4 WD robotic vehicle, AgRover was able to work under four steering modes, including crabbing, front steering, rear steering, and coordinated steering. These steering modes provided extraordinary flexibilities to cope with off-road path tracking and turning situations. AgRover could be manually controlled by a remote joystick to perform activities under individual PID controller of each motor. Socket based software, written in Visual C#, was developed at both AgRover side and remote PC side to manage bi-directional data communication. Safety redundancy was also considered and implemented during the software development. One of the prominent challenges in automated navigation control for off-road vehicles is to overcome the inaccuracy of vehicle modeling and the complexity of soil-tire interactions. Further, the robotic vehicle is a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) high-dimensional nonlinear system, which is hard to be controlled or incorporated by conventional linearization methods. To this end, a robust nonlinear navigation controller was developed based on the Sliding Mode Control (SMC) theory and AgRover was used as the test platform to validate the controller performance. Based on the theoretical framework of such robust controller development, a series of field experiments on robust trajectory tracking control were carried out and promising results were achieved. Another vitally important component in automated agricultural field equipment navigation is automatic headland turning. Until now automated headland turning still remains as a challenging task for most auto-steer agricultural vehicles. This is particularly true after planting where precise alignment between crop row and tractor or tractor-implement is critical when equipment entering the next path. Given the motion constraints originated from nonholonomic agricultural vehicles and allowable headland turning space, to realize automated headland turning, an optimized headland turning trajectory planner is highly desirable. In this dissertation research, an optimization scheme was developed to incorporate vehicle system models, a minimum turning-time objective, and a set of associated motion constraints through a direct collocation nonlinear programming (DCNLP) optimization approach. The optimization algorithms were implemented using Matlab scripts and TOMLAB/SNOPT tool boxes. Various case studies including tractor and tractor-trailer combinations under different headland constraints were conducted. To validate the soundness of the developed optimization algorithm, the planner generated turning trajectory was compared with the hand-calculated trajectory when analytical approach was possible. The overall trajectory planning results clearly demonstrated the great potential of utilizing DCNLP methods for headland turning trajectory optimization for a tractor with or without towed implements...|$|R

40|$|Markov {{decision}} processes (MPDs) {{have become}} a popular model for real-world problems of planning under uncertainty. A vide range of applications has been published within the fields of natural resources management, forestry, <b>agricultural</b> economics, and <b>robotics.</b> An MDP {{can be used to}} represent and optimize the management of an environment. A state variable is used to represent {{the current state of the}} environment and the interaction with the environment is expressed with an action variable, allowing for stochastic transition from one state to another state. A transition function is used to express the transition between the different states of the environment, and a reward function expresses the rewards received by applying an action when the environment is in a specific state. MDPs can thereby be used to optimize management strategies for problems with uncertain effects of actions, multiple and conflicting objectives, stochastic events, and stochastic environments. A common problem when optimizing management strategies for natural resources is that large areas have to be considered, rendering the state and action space of the MDP large. For example, an agricultural area consisting of thousands of crop fields, or forests consisting of thousands of stands. Also, spatial aspects may have to be considered. Some examples are management of epidemics, invasive or endangered species, management to prevent wind damage and wild fire. However, the structure of the problem can be used to model the problem on a compact form. For example is the probability of a tree being damaged by wind only on the state of the neighbouring trees. This type of local dependency and internal structure can be used to express the problem on a compact factored form. For example, instead of modelling the state of forest with a single state variable, a set of state variables is utilized, each expressing the state of a part of forest. A number of different representational models have been proposed for this type of problems. Factored MDPs and collaborative multiagent MDPs are two frameworks that have recently received a loot of attention. The graph-based Markov decision process (GMDP) framework has recently been developed specifically for modelling a range of large-scale spatiotemporal problems. As the name suggests, the GMDP uses a graph structure to represent the transition and reward functions on a compact form. Two algorithms for computing approximate solutions for GMDPs have been proposed. The algorithms are capable of solving large-scale GMDPs as their running time increases only linearly and polynomially with the size of the problem for a fixed induced width of the graph. However, the algorithms are model-dependent and require the transition and reward functions to be known. Simulation based models of the transition and reward functions can therefore not be used. Since there are a large number of simulation based models of real-world management problems, for example (Blennow & Sallnäs, 2004; Finney, 1994), the development of model-free solution algorithms is an important extension of the GMDP framework and will increase the applicability of GMDPs. In this paper, we describe a number of model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for GMDPs derived from existing model-free RL algorithms for collaborative multiagent MDPs. The collaborativemultiagent MDP framework is similar to the GMDP framework in a number of aspects, and in this paper we use these similarities to propose RL algorithms for GMDPs. The performance of the algorithms is compared to model-dependent algorithms for a medium- and large-scale forest management problem. Our experimental results show that the proposed RL algorithms are able to efficiently compute policies demonstrating nearoptimal performance. The policies computed by the RL algorithms are of similar quality to policies computed by the model-dependent algorithms...|$|R
40|$|The Potato Operation is {{a project}} {{belonging}} to the domain of <b>agricultural</b> <b>robotics.</b> It aims to automate pulp sampling of potatoes in order to detect viral diseases. The results of the analysis of these samples are used for the certification of potatoes marked out as seed. The difficulty of this problem lies in the high variability of natural objects, such as their shape, colour or texture. This article presents two computer vision approaches that have been implemented and tested, {{as well as the}} robotic apparatus required for the complete installation. The first computer vision approach, so-called 3 D image analysis, is based on a combination of classical image analysis methods with active vision. The second approach, so-called thermography, combines the analysis of thermal images of potatoes with active vision. Other methods are also briefly described, that could lead to possible improvements of the results; they rely on alternative lighting schemes, such as fluorometry or the use of mu [...] ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Web of Things (WoT) {{extends the}} Internet of Things (IoT) {{considering}} that each physical object {{can be accessed}} and controlled using Web-based languages and protocols. However, due to the mobility of physical objects and to the short radio range of the wireless interfaces they are equipped with, frequent and unpredictable connectivity disruptions may occur between the physical objects and the Web clients used to control and access these objects. This paper presents a disruption-tolerant RESTful support for the WoT, in which resources offered by physical objects are identified by URIs and accessed through stateless services. Service requests and responses are forwarded using the store-carry-and-forward principle. A complete service invocation model is provided, allowing to perform unicast, anycast, mul-ticast and broadcast service invocations either using HTTP or CoAP, which makes it particularly suited for the WoT. This disruption-tolerant support is illustrated by {{a case study in}} the context of <b>agricultural</b> <b>robotics...</b>|$|E
