5|$|A team {{typically}} {{consists of}} nine competitors: three honors, three scholastic and three varsity. However, since {{only the top}} two scores from each category count towards the team's total score, a team can compete with as few as six students without any point deduction. Students may compete in a higher category than the one they are assigned to, but generally {{it is to the}} students' advantage to compete in the lowest category they can. Scores in Varsity <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> lower than those in Scholastic, and those in Scholastic <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> lower than those in Honors.|$|E

5|$|Alates are {{collected}} when {{the rainy season}} begins. During a nuptial flight, they <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> seen around lights {{to which they are}} attracted, and so nets are set up on lamps and captured alates are later collected. The wings are removed through a technique that is similar to winnowing. The best result comes when they are lightly roasted on a hot plate or fried until crisp. Oil is not required as their bodies usually contain sufficient amounts of oil. Termites <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> eaten when livestock is lean and tribal crops have not yet developed or produced any food, or if food stocks from a previous growing season are limited.|$|E

5|$|Although a {{complete}} formulation of M-theory is not known, the theory should describe two- and five-dimensional objects called branes {{and should be}} approximated by eleven-dimensional supergravity at low energies. Modern attempts to formulate M-theory <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> based on matrix theory or the AdS/CFT correspondence.|$|E
5|$|Although {{globular}} clusters generally appear spherical in form, ellipticities can occur due to tidal interactions.

In particular, both the HPP and FHP lattice gas automata can be implemented with a two-state block cellular automaton using the Margolus neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Because they overstabilize the pentadienyl cation, β-electron {{donating}} substiuents often severely impede Nazarov cyclization.

5|$|Brachytherapy {{for skin}} cancer {{provides}} good cosmetic results and clinical efficacy; studies {{with up to}} 5 years follow-up have shown that brachytherapy is highly effective in terms local control, and is comparable to EBRT.
