5|$|Both {{resident}} and transient orangutans aggregate on large fruiting trees to feed. The fruits {{tend to be}} abundant, so competition is low and individuals may engage in social interactions. Orangutans will also form travelling groups with members moving between different food sources. These groups tend {{to be made of}} only a few individuals. They <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consortships between an adult male and female.|$|E
5|$|Baleen {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} classified under the parvorder Mysticeti, and consist of four extant families: Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (gray whale). Balaenids are distinguished by their enlarged head and thick blubber, while rorquals and gray whales generally have a flat head, long throat pleats, {{and are more}} streamlined than Balaenids. Rorquals <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> longer than the latter. Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and artiodactyls are now classified under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still referred to as Artiodactyla (given that the cetaceans are deeply nested with the artiodactyls). The closest living relatives to baleen whales are toothed whales both from the infraorder Cetacea.|$|E
5|$|Horses are prey {{animals with}} a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first {{reaction}} to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened. They <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.|$|E

50|$|Although several {{statistical}} packages (e.g., SPSS, SAS) {{report the}} Wald statistic {{to assess the}} contribution of individual predictors, the Wald statistic has limitations. When the regression coefficient is large, the standard error of the regression coefficient <b>also</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> large increasing the probability of Type-II error. The Wald statistic <b>also</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> biased when data are sparse.|$|R

5|$|The {{method of}} Malaysian batik making is {{different}} from those of Indonesian Javanese batik, the pattern being larger and simpler with only occasional use of the canting to create intricate patterns. It relies heavily on brush painting to apply colours to fabrics. The colours <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lighter and more vibrant than deep coloured Javanese batik. The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers. Malaysian batik often displays plants and flowers to avoid the interpretation of human and animal images as idolatry, in accordance with local Islamic doctrine. However, the butterfly theme is a common exception.|$|E
5|$|Hummingbirds and ornithophilous (bird-pollinated) flowers {{have evolved}} a mutualistic relationship. The flowers have nectar {{suited to the}} birds' diet, their color suits the birds' vision and their shape fits that of the birds' bills. The {{blooming}} times of the flowers have also been found to coincide with hummingbirds' breeding seasons. The floral characteristics of ornithophilous plants vary greatly among each other compared to closely related insect-pollinated species. These flowers <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more ornate, complex, and showy than their insect pollinated counterparts. It is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first, and ornithophilous species diverged at a later time. There is not much scientific support for instances of the reverse of this divergence: from ornithophily to insect pollination. The diversity in floral phenotype in ornithophilous species, and the relative consistency observed in bee-pollinated species {{can be attributed to}} the direction of the shift in pollinator preference.|$|E
5|$|In many districts Taiwanese aborigines tend to {{vote for}} the Kuomintang, {{to the point that the}} {{legislative}} seats allocated to the aborigines are popularly described as iron votes for the pan-blue coalition. This may seem surprising in light of the focus of the pan-green coalition on promoting aboriginal culture as part of the Taiwanese nationalist discourse against the KMT. However, this voting pattern can be explained on economic grounds, and as part of an inter-ethnic power struggle waged in the electorate. Some aborigines see the rhetoric of Taiwan nationalism as favoring the majority Hoklo speakers rather than themselves. Aboriginal areas <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> poor and their economic vitality tied to the entrenched patronage networks established by the Kuomintang over the course of its fifty-five year reign.|$|E

5|$|The {{mating system}} of {{pinnipeds}} varies from extreme polygyny to serial monogamy. Of the 33 species, 20 breed on land, {{and the remaining}} 13 breed on ice. Species that breed on land are usually polygynous, as females gather in large aggregations and males are able to mate with {{them as well as}} defend them from rivals. Polygynous species include elephant seals, grey seals and most otariids. Land-breeding pinnipeds tend to mate on islands where there are fewer terrestrial predators. Few islands are favorable for breeding, and those that are tend to be crowded. Since the land they breed on is fixed, females return to the same sites for many years. The males arrive earlier in the season and wait for them. The males stay on land and try to mate with as many females as they can; some of them will even fast. If a male leaves the beach to feed, he will likely lose mating opportunities and his dominance. Polygynous species <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> extremely sexual dimorphic in favor of males. This dimorphism manifests itself in larger chests and necks, longer canines and denser fur—all traits that help males in fights for females. Increased body weight in males increases the length of time they can fast due to the ample energy reserves stored in the blubber. Larger males also likely enjoy access to feeding grounds that smaller ones are unable to access due to their lower thermoregulatory ability and decreased energy stores. In some instances, only the largest males are able to reach the furthest deepest foraging grounds where they enjoy maximum energetic yields that are unavailable to smaller males and females.|$|E

25|$|Ukrainian customs {{are heavily}} {{influenced}} by Orthodox Christianity, the dominant religion in the country. Gender roles <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more traditional, and grandparents play {{a greater role in}} bringing up children, than in the West. The culture of Ukraine has also been influenced by its eastern and western neighbours, reflected in its architecture, music and art.|$|E
25|$|The type of {{alkali metal}} used determines {{the kind of}} soap product. Sodium soaps, {{prepared}} from sodium hydroxide, are firm, whereas potassium soaps, derived from potassium hydroxide, are softer or often liquid. Historically, potassium hydroxide was extracted {{from the ashes of}} bracken or other plants. Lithium soaps <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hard—these are used exclusively in greases.|$|E
25|$|Wild silks <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more {{difficult}} to dye than silk from the cultivated silkworm. A technique known as demineralizing allows the mineral layer around the cocoon of wild silk moths to be removed, leaving only variability in color {{as a barrier to}} creating a commercial silk industry based on wild silks in the parts of the world where wild silk moths thrive, such as in Africa and South America.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>also</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> omitted {{between a}} {{preceding}} vowel and an adjacent stop or affricate rapid speech, causing the lengthening of the vowel or diphthongization (e.g. volt [...] 'was', polgár [...] 'citizen'). This is considered non-standard.|$|R
50|$|Generally Diesel {{traction}} {{has several}} downsides compared to electric traction, namely higher fuel costs, more noise and exhaust {{as well as}} worse acceleration and top speed performance. The power <b>to</b> weight ratio <b>also</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worse.|$|R

25|$|Children {{from poor}} {{immigrant}} or working-class families {{are less likely}} to succeed in school than children from middle- or upper-class backgrounds. This disadvantage for the financially challenged of Germany is greater than in any other industrialized nation. However, the true reasons stretch beyond economic ones. The poor <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less educated. After allowing for parental education, money does not {{play a major role in}} children's academic outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies suggest}} people with secure {{attachment}} styles have longer-lasting relationships. This may be {{partly due to}} commitment. People with secure attachment styles tend to express more commitment to their relationships. People with secure attachment styles <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more satisfied with their relationships, which may encourage them {{to stay in their}} relationships longer. However, secure attachment styles are by no means a guarantee of long-lasting relationships.|$|E
25|$|Southern {{and coastal}} Connecticut is the broad {{transition}} zone {{from the cold}} continental climates of the north to the milder temperate/subtropical climates to the south. The frost free season is greater than 180 days across far southern/coastal Connecticut, coastal Rhode Island, and the islands (Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard). Winters <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> much sunnier in southern Connecticut and southern Rhode Island compared {{to the rest of}} New England.|$|E

25|$|Instead of {{watching}} for anomalous phenomena {{that might be}} precursory signs of an impending earthquake, other approaches to predicting earthquakes look for trends or patterns that lead to an earthquake. As these trends may be complex and involve many variables, advanced statistical techniques are often needed to understand them, therefore these are sometimes called statistical methods. These approaches <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more probabilistic, and to have larger time periods, and so merge into earthquake forecasting.|$|E
25|$|Numerous guides {{such as the}} 2004 book Cities Ranked and Rated: More than 400 Metropolitan Areas Evaluated in the U.S. and Canada have {{mentioned}} Gainesville's low cost of living. The restaurants near the University of Florida <b>also</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> inexpensive. The property taxes are high to offset {{the cost of the}} university, as the university's land is tax-exempt. However, the median home cost remains slightly below the national average, and Gainesville residents, like all Floridians, do not pay state income taxes.|$|E
50|$|Species {{separation}} is at times {{difficult because of}} sexual dimorphism. For example, males usually have longer and wider antennae than females, although this is often not the case. The male <b>also</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> larger but narrower, sometimes attributed to the female’s brood pouch.|$|R
30|$|CT is {{generally}} preferred over MRI for segmentation because of higher spatial resolution, isotropic voxels, robustness (does not require long breath-holds) and calibrated Hounsfield units (whereas MRI provides arbitrary signal intensity). The portal venous phase <b>also</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> popular as it enhances the liver parenchyma.|$|R
