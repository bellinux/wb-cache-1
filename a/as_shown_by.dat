5|$|C. lepophagus was {{a similar}} in weight to modern coyotes, but had shorter limb bones that {{indicates}} a less cursorial lifestyle. The coyote represents a more primitive form of Canis than the gray wolf, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> its relatively small size and its comparatively narrow skull and jaws, which lack the grasping power necessary {{to hold the}} large prey in which wolves specialize. This is further corroborated by the coyote's sagittal crest, which is low or totally flattened, thus indicating a weaker bite than the wolf's. The coyote is not a specialized carnivore as the wolf is, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> the larger chewing surfaces on the molars, reflecting the species' relative dependence on vegetable matter. In these respects, the coyote resembles the fox-like progenitors of the genus {{more so than the}} wolf.|$|E
5|$|Chew Stoke {{has a long}} history, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> {{the number}} and range of its heritage-listed buildings. The village is at the {{northern}} end of Chew Valley Lake, which was created in the 1950s, close to a dam, pumping station, sailing club, and fishing lodge. A tributary of the River Chew, which rises in Strode, runs through the village.|$|E

5|$|In 1789, Sally and James Hemings {{returned}} to the United States with Jefferson. He was 46 years old and seven years a widower. <b>As</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> Jefferson's father-in-law, John Wayles, wealthy Virginia widowers frequently raped enslaved women. Historian Joshua D. Rothman noted {{it was not unusual}} for the time for Jefferson to choose to do so. White society simply expected these men to be discreet.|$|E
5|$|In a more Christianized version, St.Elijah shoots {{lightning}} at the devils {{who lead}} the hail clouds; the devils {{in this case}} are obviously ale. <b>As</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> these examples, beliefs with various degrees of Christianization, from none to almost complete, can exist side by side.|$|E
5|$|Other Triturus species only meet at narrow zones {{on their}} range borders. Hybridisation does occur {{in several of}} these contact zones, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> genetic data and {{intermediate}} forms, but is rare, supporting overall reproductive isolation. Backcrossing and introgression do however occur <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> mitochondrial DNA analysis. In {{a case study in}} the Netherlands, genes of the introduced Italian crested newt were found to introgress into the gene pool of the native northern crested newt. The two marbled newt species can be found in proximity in a narrow area in central Portugal and Spain, but they usually breed in separate ponds, and individuals in that area could be clearly identified as one of the two species. Nevertheless, there is introgression, occurring in both directions at some parts of the contact zone, and only {{in the direction of the}} southern marbled newt where that species had historically replaced the marbled newt (see also above, Glacial refugia and recolonisation).|$|E

5|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} have argued in response that no scientist's claims {{are treated as}} sacrosanct, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> the aspects of Darwin's theory that have been rejected or revised by scientists {{over the years to}} form first neo-Darwinism and later the modern evolutionary synthesis. The claim that evolution relies on faith is likewise rejected on the grounds that evolution has strong supporting evidence, and therefore does not require faith.|$|E
5|$|The event {{also may}} {{have served as a}} {{symbolic}} exorcism of Charles's mental illness at a time when magicians and sorcerers were commonly consulted by members of the court. In the early 15th century, ritual burning of evil, demonic, or Satanic forces was not uncommon <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> Orléans's later persecution of the King's physician Jehan de Bar, who was burned to death after confessing, under torture, to practicing sorcery.|$|E

5|$|A single {{mandible}} from Porto Spanjo (one of {{the sites}} where fossils of A.donovani have been found), without preserved molars, differs from all Agathaeromys dentaries and is thought to represent an unknown different sigmodontine rodent. This jaw is more slender than A.donovani dentaries, has a shorter diastema (gap) between the incisors and molars, has the incisor less shifted lingually relative to the molars, and has more roots under the molars, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> the preserved alveoli.|$|E

Supplementation with selenium or vitamin E does not {{reduce the risk of}} cardiovascular disease. Oxidative stress can be considered as either a cause or consequence of some diseases, an area of research stimulating drug development for antioxidant compounds for use as potential therapies.|$|E

5|$|Despite Kabuto {{claiming}} that the technique is flawless, it does have several flaws, including that the reanimated can choose to leave their vessels to willingly drift back to the afterlife. Those who are paralyzed, sealed, or subjected to certain genjutsu, such as Komo Amatsukami: Koto, cannot take further action to free themselves until the technique is canceled. Also, the reanimated can sever their link to the jutsu so they will remain among the living even after the jutsu is canceled, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> Madara Uchiha. Furthermore, if such a ninja who lost a body part while alive is brought back to true life with the Rinnegan's Samsara of Heavenly Life Jutsu, the living equivalent of that ninja's body part is absent.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th Dynasty, prince Khaemwaset, {{a son of}} Ramesses II, {{undertook}} restoration works throughout Egypt on pyramids and temples {{which had}} fallen into ruin. Inscriptions on the stone cladding of the pyramid of Sahure show that it was restored at this time. This is possibly because, from the mid 18th Dynasty onwards, the mortuary temple of Sahure served as a sanctuary for the goddess Sekhmet. In {{the second part of}} the 18th Dynasty and during the 19th Dynasty numerous visitors left inscriptions, stelae and statues in the temple. Activities seemed to have continued on-site for a long time, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> graffiti dating from the 26th Dynasty (664525 BC) until the Ptolemaic period (33230 BC).|$|E

5|$|During the mafic capping stage, basanite, alkali olivine basalt and hawaiite erupted {{mainly from}} small {{parasitic}} cones, tuff rings and fissures {{in the eastern}} half of the shield. Eruptions occurred subglacially, subaqueously and/or subaerially <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> a wide range in the degree of vesicularity, freshness and glass content of the lavas. In most cases, each parasitic cone produced three or four lava flows from breaches in the cone walls. These were erupted as pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā, but the tops of the lava flows are commonly missing due to erosion. Hawaiite was the most extensively erupted lava of the mafic capping stage, occurring mostly {{at the southern end of}} the Itcha Range but also in its interior.|$|E
