5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally <b>ambivalent</b> when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (<b>ambivalent</b> resistant) or helplessness (<b>ambivalent</b> passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E
5|$|Research done by McCarthy and Taylor (1999), {{found that}} {{children}} with abusive childhood experiences {{were more likely to}} develop <b>ambivalent</b> attachments. The study also {{found that children}} with <b>ambivalent</b> attachments were more likely to experience difficulties in maintaining intimate relationships as adults.|$|E
5|$|Due to Tool's {{incorporation}} {{of visual arts}} and very long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and art rock. The relationship between the band and today's music industry is <b>ambivalent,</b> at times marked by censorship, and the band's insistence on privacy.|$|E
5|$|In the anime film series Persona 3 The Movie, {{he takes}} the name of Makoto Yuki. Makoto is portrayed as an <b>ambivalent</b> {{individual}} with an initial neutral viewpoint on the film's theme of life and death, making his growth via new found experiences {{the focus of the}} movie.|$|E
5|$|Many rites {{accepting}} {{women have}} ritual of a Masonic style, are founded by Masons, but at best have an <b>ambivalent</b> reception amongst Grand Lodge masons. Nonetheless, they actively recruit new members from within regular masonry.|$|E
5|$|Patricia McKinsey Crittenden has {{elaborated}} classifications {{of further}} forms of avoidant and <b>ambivalent</b> attachment behaviour. These include the caregiving and punitive behaviours also identified by Main and Cassidy (termed A3 and C3 respectively), but also other patterns such as compulsive {{compliance with the}} wishes of a threatening parent (A4).|$|E
5|$|The NAACP's chief counsel, Thurgood Marshall—who {{was later}} {{appointed}} to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1967—argued the case before the Supreme Court for the plaintiffs. Assistant attorney general Paul Wilson—later distinguished emeritus {{professor of law at}} the University of Kansas—conducted the state's <b>ambivalent</b> defense in his first appellate argument.|$|E
5|$|The Vandals {{were also}} {{weakened}} by the hostility of their Roman subjects, the continued existence among the Vandals of a faction loyal to Hilderic, and by the <b>ambivalent</b> position of the Moorish tribes, who watched the oncoming conflict from the sidelines, ready to join the victor and seize the spoils.|$|E
5|$|The album debuted {{at number}} 86 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, but {{fell off the}} next week. It {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. Although some were <b>ambivalent</b> towards its loose blaxploitation concept and Saadiq's songwriting, critics praised the album's production quality and vintage musical approach. It is currently out of print.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, Circus {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, who complimented its production but were <b>ambivalent</b> towards its lyrical content. It debuted at {{number one on}} the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over 505,000 copies, making it her fifth album to reach the top of the chart.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, the BlackBerry Bold 9700 {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. The smartphone was commended for its design and most changes were favored, {{such as the}} trackpad. However, critics were <b>ambivalent</b> towards the dated software and the slow browser, and some concluded that the device did not set itself apart from previous models.|$|E
5|$|A polystylist, Shostakovich {{developed}} a hybrid voice, combining {{a variety of}} different musical techniques into his works. His music is characterized by sharp contrasts, elements of the grotesque, and <b>ambivalent</b> tonality; the composer was also heavily influenced by the neo-classical style pioneered by Igor Stravinsky, and (especially in his symphonies) by the late Romanticism associated with Gustav Mahler.|$|E
5|$|An elf (plural: elves) {{is a type}} of human-shaped supernatural {{being in}} Germanic mythology and folklore. In medieval Germanic-speaking cultures, elves seem {{generally}} to have been thought of as beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty, <b>ambivalent</b> towards everyday people and capable of either helping or hindering them. However, the details of these beliefs have varied considerably over time and space, and have flourished in both pre-Christian and Christian cultures.|$|E
5|$|An infant's {{internal}} working {{model is}} developed {{in response to}} the infant's experience of the outcomes of his or her proximity-seeking behaviors. If the caregiver is accepting of these proximity-seeking behaviors and grants access, the infant develops a secure organization; if the caregiver consistently denies the infant access, an avoidant organization develops; and if the caregiver inconsistently grants access, an <b>ambivalent</b> organization develops.|$|E
5|$|Chinese and North Vietnamese {{documents}} {{state that}} relations between them worsened in 1973–75. A Vietnamese document claimed that China hindered the eventual reunification, while Chinese documents {{claimed that the}} source of the conflict was Vietnamese policy towards the Spratly and the Paracel Islands. However, the core issue for the Chinese was to minimize Vietnam's cooperation with the Soviets. Increasing Soviet/Vietnamese cooperation left China <b>ambivalent</b> about reunification.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Schleiermacher, an {{influential}} nineteenth-century Reformed theologian, saw baptism {{as the way}} the church receives new members and taught that faith is a precondition for baptism. He was <b>ambivalent</b> about the practice of infant baptism, teaching {{that it was not}} an essential institution, but could be continued as long as the church was faithful in bringing children to confirmation. Schleiermacher also saw baptism as primarily individual rather than initiating one into a covenant community, and rejected the idea that baptism should be connected with Old Testament circumcision.|$|E
5|$|Lessing was spurred {{to write}} The Good Terrorist by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{bombing of the}} Harrods {{department}} store in London in 1983. She {{had been a member}} of the British Communist Party, but left after the 1956 Hungarian uprising. Some reviewers labelled the novel a satire, while Lessing called it humorous. The title is an oxymoron which highlights Alice's <b>ambivalent</b> nature.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of those}} in the protest {{movements}} were young children {{at the time of the}} invasion and had been educated under the Indonesian system. They resented the repression of Timorese cultural and political life at the expense of the Indonesian, were <b>ambivalent</b> of Indonesian economic development, and spoke Portuguese amongst themselves, stressing their Portuguese heritage. Seeking help from Portugal for self-determination, they considered Indonesia an occupying force. Abroad, Fretilin's members—most notably former journalist José Ramos-Horta (later to be Prime Minister and President)—pushed their cause in diplomatic forums.|$|E
5|$|Regarding the {{continuation}} of Slipknot, Taylor told NME Gray would want them to continue and he felt they should but he was <b>ambivalent</b> about returning to the band. Slipknot returned to touring in 2011, performing {{a small number of}} shows in Europe with bassist Dennis Curlee. They headlined the Sonisphere Festival and Rock in Rio alongside Iron Maiden and Metallica, and performed at Belgium's Graspop Metal Meeting. Donnie Steele substituted for Gray in the concerts; he was positioned behind Jordison and obscured from the audience's view.|$|E
5|$|Therese's boyfriend, Richard, {{wants her}} to go to France with him, hoping they will marry, but she is <b>ambivalent</b> about their relationship. A mutual friend, Dannie, invites Therese to his workplace, The New York Times, and offers to {{introduce}} her to a photo editor friend. Meanwhile, Carol is going through a difficult divorce from her neglectful husband, Harge. Carol calls Frankenberg's to thank the clerk who returned the gloves and invites Therese to lunch. Therese visits Dannie and he kisses her, but she becomes uncomfortable and leaves.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection was {{met with}} {{generally}} mixed reviews from music critics, who were <b>ambivalent</b> towards the new songs' production and questioned the decision to reissue Teenage Dream. As an independent release, the reissue reached the top ten in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It has sold one million copies globally.|$|E
5|$|While <b>ambivalent</b> {{about much}} of The Five's music, Tchaikovsky {{remained}} on friendly terms {{with most of}} its members. In 1869, he and Balakirev worked together on what became Tchaikovsky's first recognized masterpiece, the fantasy-overture Romeo and Juliet, a work which The Five wholeheartedly embraced. The group also welcomed his Second Symphony, subtitled the Little Russian. Despite their support, Tchaikovsky made considerable efforts to ensure his musical independence from the group {{as well as from}} the conservative faction at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory.|$|E
5|$|Around 1563 Lopez married Sarah Anes (b. 1550), {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} of another New Christian refugee from the Portuguese Inquisition, the merchant Dunstan Anes, who {{had settled in}} London in 1540. According to Samuel, both the Anes and Lopez households secretly practised Judaism, which was then illegal in England, while outwardly conforming as Anglicans. Other scholars are <b>ambivalent</b> on the matter; Lopez would always insist {{that he was a}} Christian. Roderigo and Sarah had four sons and two daughters, of whom at least the eldest five—Ellyn (Elinor), Ambrose, Douglas, William and Ann—were baptised within the hospital precincts at St Bartholomew-the-Less between 1564 and 1579. Lopez's brother Lewis lived with them in Holborn; a second brother, Diego Lopes Aleman, became a merchant in Antwerp and Venice.|$|E
5|$|As Roosevelt {{became more}} radical in his progressivism, Taft was {{hardened}} in his resolve to achieve re-nomination, {{as he was}} convinced that the progressives threatened the very foundation of the government. One blow to Taft was the loss of Archibald Butt, one of the last links between the previous and present presidents, as Butt had formerly served Roosevelt. <b>Ambivalent</b> between his loyalties, Butt went to Europe on vacation in early 1912. He sailed for home in April on the Titanic and died in its sinking, a death Taft found hard to accept as his body was not recovered.|$|E
5|$|At first, Schwarzkopf was <b>ambivalent</b> {{during the}} run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. He {{initially}} endorsed an invasion after Colin Powell's presentation to the United Nations on February 6, 2003. When weapons of mass destruction were not located in the country after the invasion, he changed his stance. He was critical of the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, feeling the initial offensive operations plans did {{not take into account the}} cultural complexities of Iraq. In 2004, he was critical of Donald Rumsfeld and his handling of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He felt it was a mistake to send U.S. Army Reserve troops into the country without adequate training.|$|E
5|$|Democracy, or {{the rule}} of the many over themselves. The rule of the masses is positive, in that it is less likely to lead to civil war than the alternatives. An <b>ambivalent</b> feature of {{democracy}} is the fact that representatives are forced to compromise their ideologies to stay in power, which can curb both positive and negative tendencies. On the negative side, democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a democracy is easily corruptible by politicians with agendas. Also, a democracy may easily slip into popular apathy which allows for corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E
5|$|His {{next film}} roles {{were in a}} series of {{independent}} features: Another Day in Paradise (1997), part of an ensemble cast that included James Woods, Melanie Griffith, Vincent Kartheiser, and Natasha Gregson Wagner, and In Desert Blue (1998), where he had a supporting role in the film. He received his substantial role in the 1998 film The Man in the Iron Mask, where he played Raoul, the ill-fated son of John Malkovich's dueling Musketeer, Athos. The film uses characters from Alexandre Dumas' d'Artagnan Romances, and is very loosely adapted from some plot elements of The Vicomte de Bragelonne. The film received <b>ambivalent</b> reviews, but was a success at the box office, earning $182million worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In {{his more}} public existence, I. C. Filitti was still {{regarded}} with sympathy {{by the entire}} political and cultural establishment. In 1915, he was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy. The institution also granted him its prestigious Năsturel Herescu Award. This was in recognition of his groundbreaking monograph on modernization under the Regulamentul regime: Domniile române sub Regulamentul Organic ("Romanian Reigns under Regulamentul Organic"). It described in some detail the culture shock of the 1830s, when the Westernized elites reversed a process of Turkification, and noted the <b>ambivalent</b> policies of Russian governors. The book also speaks about the 1832 manhunt for, and forced sedentarization of, Wallachia's Romani people, both the fugitive slaves and the free nomads.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by indie {{rock bands}} and house music, Graduation marked a {{departure}} {{away from the}} ornate, soul-based sound of West's previous releases toward a more anthemic style of rap music that would function well while he was performing in large arenas. Toward this end, West incorporated synthesizer sounds into his production and dabbled with electronic music, while sampling from a wider spectrum of music genres. Lyrically, the album is more introspective in comparison to its predecessors, as West dedicated much of Graduation towards analyzing himself and conveying his <b>ambivalent</b> outlook on his newfound fame. It continues the education theme of West's previous two studio albums, The College Dropout (2004) and Late Registration (2005).|$|E
5|$|Reviews of {{the album}} {{generally}} complimented Carey's voice and technique, but were <b>ambivalent</b> towards the songwriting. It nonetheless became a commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart for eleven consecutive weeks. Mariah Carey was certified nine-times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of ninemillion copies in the United States. The album experienced similar success in Canada, where it topped the charts and was certified seven-times Platinum. Mariah Carey fared well in other worldwide territories, reaching the top ten in the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and United Kingdom. Worldwide, the album {{has sold more than}} 15 million copies.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU was {{internally}} divided when it purged Communists {{from its}} leadership in 1940, and that ambivalence continued as it {{decided whether to}} defend alleged Communists during the late 1940s. Some ACLU leaders were anti-Communist, and felt that the ACLU should not defend any victims. Some ACLU leaders felt that Communists were entitled to free speech protections, and the ACLU should defend them. Other ACLU leaders were uncertain about {{the threat posed by}} Communists, and tried to establish a compromise between the two extremes. This <b>ambivalent</b> state of affairs would last until 1954, when the civil liberties faction prevailed, leading to the resignation of most of the anti-Communist leaders.|$|E
5|$|The Representatives' Centralization's {{relationship}} to the SPD was <b>ambivalent.</b> The organization was allied with the SPD and supported the Erfurt Program. At the same time, the party mostly opposed {{the founding of the}} Representatives' Centralization and called upon its members to rejoin the centralized trade unions. The FVdG remained affiliated with the SPD, which in turn tolerated it because the SPD was afraid a split would lead to a large loss of members. The FVdG stated it would rejoin the centralized trade unions like the SPD leadership desired only if the centralized unions accepted the FVdG's organizational principles.|$|E
5|$|The V-2 rocket was one {{of several}} {{innovative}} long-range weapons developed by the Germans after the failure of the Luftwaffe to strike a decisive blow against Britain. It was a revolutionary weapon – the world's first operational SRBM – that had been developed in a secret programme begun in 1936. The German leadership hoped that a barrage of rockets unleashed against London would force Britain out of the war. Although Adolf Hitler was at first <b>ambivalent,</b> he eventually became an enthusiastic supporter of the V-2 programme as Allied air forces carried out increasingly devastating attacks on German cities.|$|E
5|$|The album debuted {{at number}} four on the US Billboard 200 chart, with 210,000 copies sold {{in its first}} week. It has sold over 4.7 million copies in the United States, {{receiving}} a 4 platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); worldwide sales stand at over eight million. 8701 received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Usher's vocals and development as an artist, but were <b>ambivalent</b> towards some of the album's material. The album earned Usher numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, three Billboard Music Awards and a BET Award.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Lima played an <b>ambivalent</b> {{role in the}} 1821–1824 Peruvian War of Independence; the city suffered exactions from Royalist and Patriot armies alike. After independence, Lima became {{the capital of the}} Republic of Peru. It enjoyed a short period of prosperity in the mid-19th century until the 1879–1883 War of the Pacific when it was occupied and looted by Chilean troops. After the war, the city went through a period of demographic expansion and urban renewal. Population growth accelerated in the 1940s spurred by immigration from the Andean regions of Peru. This gave rise to the proliferation of shanty towns as public services failed {{to keep up with the}} city expansion.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{established}} {{procedure for}} removing an English king. Adam Orleton, the Bishop of Hereford, {{made a series}} of public allegations about Edward's conduct as king, and in January 1327 a parliament convened at Westminster at which the question of Edward's future was raised; Edward refused to attend the gathering. Parliament, initially <b>ambivalent,</b> responded to the London crowds that called for Prince Edward to take the throne. On 12 January the leading barons and clergy agreed that Edward II should be removed and replaced by his son. The following day it was presented to an assembly of the barons, where it was argued that Edward's weak leadership and personal faults had led the kingdom into disaster, and that he was incompetent to lead the country.|$|E
