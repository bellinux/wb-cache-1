[...] "He was kind of a square-shaped body, a guy [...] in a uniform didn't look all that athletic", Cleary said. [...] "He wasn't a tall, prospect-y looking guy. He looked chubby in a uniform. ...

500|$|Brooklynne Kelly Peters from Blast Magazine praised Anna Torv's acting, {{because she}} [...] "brings a {{sensitivity}} to Olivia's character that is heart-wrenching but so well integrated into her character that action scenes seem totally natural for her". The standout for her however, was John Noble's performance, as he played [...] "lovable and brilliant" [...] Walter and [...] "chillingly conniving" [...] Walternate, {{both of which}} makes him [...] "an even more unforgettable character" [...] as the audience sees what Walter could have been. The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded the episode with an A-, writing that [...] "the third season of Fringe opened tonight {{with one of the}} strongest, boldest episodes in the whole run of the series". Murray especially praised the [...] "well-written, acted and photographed" [...] taxi scenes between Olivia and Henry. The Los Angeles Times Andrew Hanson particularly enjoyed the nine-minute opening, writing that he loved the episode because of three reasons: Olivia [...] "kicked butt" [...] and stayed <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>ahead</b> of Walternate, her struggles with identity, and all of the careful details put into the parallel universe.|$|E
500|$|Farrell's next American films, American Outlaws (2001) and Hart's War (2002), {{were not}} commercially successful. His 2002–2003 films, {{including}} Phone Booth, The Recruit and S.W.A.T. (all thrillers, {{with the former}} two his first starring roles), were well received by critics and successful at the box office. Of Phone Booth, Ebert wrote that it is [...] "Farrell's to win or lose, since he's onscreen most of the time, and he shows energy and intensity". Philip French of The Observer praised Farrell's performance. In S.W.A.T., the actor starred in an ensemble cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, Olivier Martinez and Jeremy Renner; Renner became a friend. Alan Morrison of Empire wrote, [...] "Farrell can usually be relied upon to bring a spark to the bonfire. That's also true of [...]" [...] Elvis Mitchell of the New York Times criticised Farrell's accent, writing that he [...] "employ a wobbly American accent that makes him sound like an international criminal <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>ahead</b> of the authorities". Ebert and the New York Timess A.O. Scott disagreed on the actor's effectiveness in The Recruit; Ebert noted the actor's likability, but Scott felt that Farrell [...] "spends his time in a caffeinated frenzy, trying to maintain his leading-man sang-froid while registering panic, stress and confusion". Phone Booth earned $46.6million, S.W.A.T. $116.9million and The Recruit $52.8million at the box office.|$|E

Your call." [...] Regarding third-party support in Siri, he called it [...] "great", while noting the limited class of apps ("calls, messaging, payments, photos, ride-sharing apps, some CarPlay systems, and workouts"), and that sometimes a button press was required to complete the process. Beyond app integrations, he criticized Siri, writing [...] "Siri doesn't seem to have gotten a whole lot smarter than you remember". Bohn enjoyed the new machine learning technology present in the Photos app, writing that he was [...] "impressed" [...] by Apple's image recognition technology, which he noted is done locally on the device, but did criticize the error rate, where he compares the technology to Google Photos as <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>ahead.</b> Bohn liked the new designs for the Music and Maps apps, saying both the redesigns were [...] "for the better". Bohn particularly enjoyed the new lock screen, where he highlighted that notification bubbles can be 3D Touch-ed to access more information, all without needing to unlock the phone. Other small bits of new features he liked included [...] "deletable" [...] apps, upgraded [...] "widgets" [...] when 3D Touch-ing a home screen icon, and breaking news notifications in Apple News. Overall, Bohn referred to iOS 10 as [...] "Still a walled garden, but with more doors".|$|E

It is not a mathematical game, but an exact solution to problems, combined with intuition, without which art is impossible. And {{if we look at}} his work as a whole, it possesses an immeasurable logic found with few other artists, as well as the ability to open up other alternatives. It was a natural part not only of Czech, but also of progressive European art, which continued to develop the legacy of pure abstraction and constructivist tendencies." ...|$|E
