40|$|Pressure-sensitive {{adhesives}} such as tapes become easily {{contaminated by}} dust particles. By contrast, <b>animal</b> <b>adhesive</b> pads {{are able to}} self-clean and can be reused millions of times over a lifetime with little reduction in adhesion. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this ability are still unclear. Here we test in adhesive pads of stick insects (Carausius morosus) (1) whether self-cleaning is enhanced by the liquid pad secretion, and (2) whether alternating push-pull movements aid the removal of particles. We measured attachment forces of insect pads on glass after contamination with 10 m polystyrene beads. While the amount of fluid present on the pad showed {{no effect on the}} pads' susceptibility to contamination, the recovery of adhesive forces after contamination was faster when higher fluid levels were present. However, this effect {{does not appear to be}} based on a faster rate of self-cleaning since the number of spheres deposited with each step did not increase with fluid level. Instead, the fluid may aid the recovery of adhesive forces by filling in the gaps between contaminating particles, similar to the fluid's function on rough surfaces. Further, we found no evidence that an alternation of pushing and pulling movements, as found in natural steps, leads to a more efficient recovery of adhesion than repeated pulling slides. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|E

The fine {{structure of the}} trophozoites are presented and comapred with those described for other animals. Some of the trophozoites present the cytoplasm full of glycogen, rough endoplasmic reticulum-like structures and homogeneous inclusions not enclosed by membranes, recognized as lipid drops, which had not been observed in Giardia from other <b>animals.</b> The <b>adhesive</b> disk is composed of a layer of microtubules, from which fibrous ribbons extend into the cytoplasm; these ribbons are linked by layer of crossbridge filaments that shows an intermediary dense band, described {{for the first time}} in this paper. The authors regard this band as the result of the cross-bridge filaments slinding in the medium region between adjacent fibrous ribbons, and suggest a contractile activity for them.

40|$|Nautiloidea is {{the oldest}} group within the cephalopoda, and modern Nautilus differs much in its outer {{morphology}} from all other recent species; its external shell and pinhole camera eye are the most prominent distinguishing characters. A further unique feature of Nautilus within the cephalopods {{is the lack of}} suckers or hooks on the tentacles. Instead, the <b>animals</b> use <b>adhesive</b> structures present on the digital tentacles. Earlier studies focused on the general tentacle morphology and put little attention on the adhesive gland system. Our results show that the epithelial parts on the oral adhesive ridge contain three secretory cell types (columnar, goblet, and cell type 1) that differ in shape and granule size. In the non-adhesive aboral epithelium, two glandular cell types (cell types 2 and 3) are present; these were not mentioned in any earlier study and differ from the cells in the adhesive area. The secretory material of all glandular cell types consists mainly of neu tral mucopolysaccharide units, whereas one cell type in the non-adhesive epithelium also reacts positive for acidic mucopolysaccharides. The present data indicate that the glue in Nautilus consists mainly of neutral mucopolysaccharides. The glue seems to be a viscous carbohydrate gel, as known from another cephalopod species. De-attachment is apparently effectuated mechanically, i. e., by muscle contraction of the adhesive ridges and tentacle retraction...|$|R
40|$|<b>Animals</b> use <b>adhesive</b> {{secretions}} in {{a plethora}} of ways, either for attachment, egg anchorage, mating or as either active or passive defence. The most interesting function, however, {{is the use of}} adhesive threads to capture prey, as the bonding must be performed within milliseconds and under unsuitable conditions (movement of prey, variable environmental conditions, unfavourable attack angle, etc.) to be nonetheless successful. In the following study a detailed characterization of the prey capture system of the world-renowned glowworm group Arachnocampa from the macroscopic to the ultrastructural level is performed. The data reveal that the adhesive droplets consist mostly of water and display hygroscopic properties at varying humidity levels. The droplet core of Arachnocampa luminosa includes a certain amount of the elements sodium, sulphur and potassium (beside carbon, oxygen and nitrogen), while a different element composition is found in the two related species A. richardsae and A. tasmaniensis. Evidence for lipids, carbohydrates and proteins was negative on the histochemical level, however X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirm the presence of peptides within the droplet content. Different to earlier assumptions, the present study indicates that rather than oxalic acid, urea or uric acid are present in the adhesive droplets, presumably originating from the gut. Comparing the capture system in Arachnocampa with those of orb-spiders, large differences appear not only regarding the silky threads, but also, in the composition, hygroscopic properties and size of the mucous droplets...|$|R
40|$|Key {{disparities between}} {{the timing and}} methods of {{assessment}} in animal stroke studies and clinical trial {{may be part of}} the reason for the failure to translate promising findings. This study investigates the development of ischemic damage after thread occlusion MCAo in the rat, using histological and behavioural outcomes. Using the adhesive removal test we investigate the longevity of behavioural deficit after ischemic stroke in rats, and examine the practicality of using such measures as the primary outcome for future studies. Ischemic stroke was induced in 132 Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats which were assessed for behavioural and histological deficits at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 days, 12 and 24 weeks (n> 11 per timepoint). The basic behavioural score confirmed induction of stroke, with deficits specific to stroke animals. Within 7 days, these deficits resolved in 50 % of <b>animals.</b> The <b>adhesive</b> removal test revealed contralateral neglect for up to 6 months following stroke. Sample size calculations to facilitate the use of this test as the primary experimental outcome resulted in cohort sizes much larger than are the norm for experimental studies. Histological damage progressed from a necrotic infarct to a hypercellular area that cleared to leave a fluid filled cavity. Whilst absolute volume of damage changed over time, when corrected for changes in hemispheric volume, an equivalent area of damage was lost at all timepoints. Using behavioural measures at chronic timepoints presents significant challenges to the basic science community in terms of the large number of animals required and the practicalities associated with this. Multicentre preclinical randomised controlled trials as advocated by the MultiPART consortium may be the only practical way to deal with this issue...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Even when {{properly}} performed, arterial sutures are {{not always}} absolutely hemostatic. Tissue sealants and adhesives have become available {{that can be used}} to complete sutures, preventing hemorrhage problems. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of cyanoacrylate adhesive for sealing aortotomies in rabbits in a coagulopathic state, by analyzing survival of the animals and the time taken to achieve hemostasis. METHODS: Ten-mm long aortotomies were performed on the infrarenal aortas of 12 animals. In four animals, aortorrhaphy was conducted using four interrupted polypropylene sutures and in the remaining animals aortorrhaphy was performed using four or fewer polypropylene stitches, followed by application of a cyanoacrylate adhesive. RESULTS: The four <b>animals</b> sutured without <b>adhesive</b> died within the postoperative period due to severe hemorrhage (3 animals) or intestinal ischemia. The eight animals to which the adhesive was applied exhibited no transoperative bleeding, but one animal died during the postoperative period. Using cyanoacrylate permitted more rapid procedures (p< 0. 004) and no local reactions were observed in macroscopic examination of tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The cyanoacrylate adhesive demonstrated effectiveness for sealing aortotomies, considering the survival outcomes, duration of procedures and absence of local reactions on macroscopic examination...|$|R
40|$|A {{tokay gecko}} can cling to {{virtually}} any surface and support its body mass {{with a single}} toe by using the millions of keratinous setae on its toe pads. Each seta branches into hundreds of 200 -nm spatulae that make intimate contact {{with a variety of}} surface profiles. We showed previously that the combined surface area of billions of spatulae maximizes van der Waals interactions to generate large adhesive and shear forces. Geckos are not known to groom their feet yet retain their stickiness for months between molts. How geckos manage to keep their feet clean while walking about with sticky toes has remained a puzzle until now. Although self-cleaning by water droplets occurs in plant and <b>animal</b> surfaces, no <b>adhesive</b> has been shown to self-clean. In the present study, we demonstrate that gecko setae are a self-cleaning adhesive. Geckos with dirty feet recovered their ability to cling to vertical surfaces after only a few steps. Self-cleaning occurred in arrays of setae isolated from the gecko. Contact mechanical models suggest that self-cleaning occurs by an energetic disequilibrium between the adhesive forces attracting a dirt particle to the substrate and those attracting the same particle to one or more spatulae. We propose that the property of self-cleaning is intrinsic to the setal nanostructure and therefore should be replicable in synthetic adhesive materials in the future...|$|R
40|$|Putative receptors of Escherichia coli K 88 fimbriae {{are either}} tightly {{membrane}} bound or {{an integral part}} of membranes. Thus, proteins associated with piglet small intestinal mucosae were solubilized by a detergent (deoxycholate). A 74 -kDa glycoprotein (GP 74) purified from enterocyte and brush border membrane prepa-rations was specifically detected in vitro by K 88 ab fimbriae. GP 74 was recognized only in the mucosae of phenotypically <b>adhesive</b> <b>animals.</b> Metaperiodate treatment abolished the recognition, indicating that K 88 ab fimbriae-GP 74 binding required the carbohydrate moiety. This glycoprotein belongs to the transferrin family and differed from the serum transferrin of the same adhesive-phenotype piglets. Unlike intestinal transferrin, serum transferrin was recognized independently of the adhesion phenotype. The glycan moieties of intestinal and serum transferrins differed in their molar compositions. Transferrin GP 74 contained one monosialylated and monofucosylated glycan chain of the N-acetyllactosamine type. Intestinal holotransferrin exhibited pI values of 5. 2, 5. 3, 5. 5, and 5. 6, whereas serum holotransferrin pI values ranged between 5. 4 and 6. 2. Since mucosal transferrin was found intimately entrapped on membranes, we hypothesize that a K 88 ab fimbriae-transferrin-cell transferrin receptor complex might allow the bacteria to adhere to specific sites of the mucosa. The adhesion of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli to recep-tors on small intestinal surfaces has been recognized as a...|$|R
40|$|Septic shock {{caused by}} Neisseria meningitidis is {{typically}} rapidly evolving and often fatal despite antibiotic therapy. Further {{understanding of the}} mechanisms underlying the disease is necessary to reduce fatality rates. Postmortem samples from the characteristic purpuric rashes of the infection show bacterial aggregates in close association with microvessel endothelium but the species specificity of N. meningitidis has previously hindered {{the development of an}} in vivo model to study the role of adhesion on disease progression. Here we introduced human dermal microvessels into SCID/Beige mice by xenografting human skin. Bacteria injected intravenously exclusively associated with the human vessel endothelium in the skin graft. Infection was accompanied by a potent inflammatory response with the secretion of human inflammatory cytokines and recruitment of inflammatory cells. Importantly, infection also led to local vascular damage with hemostasis, thrombosis, vascular leakage and finally purpura in the grafted skin, replicating the clinical presentation {{for the first time in}} an <b>animal</b> model. The <b>adhesive</b> properties of the type IV pili of N. meningitidis were found to be the main mediator of association with the dermal microvessels in vivo. Bacterial mutants with altered type IV pili function also did not trigger inflammation or lead to vascular damage. This work demonstrates that local type IV pili mediated adhesion of N. meningitidis to the vascular wall, as opposed to circulating bacteria, determines vascular dysfunction in meningococcemia...|$|R
40|$|The {{anchorage}} {{of structures}} {{is a crucial}} element of construction, both for humans and <b>animals.</b> Spiders use <b>adhesive</b> plaques to attach silk threads to substrates. Both biological and artificial adhesive structures usually have an optimal loading angle, and are prone to varying loading situations. Silk anchorages, however, must cope with loading in highly variable directions. Here we show that the detachment forces of thread anchorages of orb-web spiders are highly robust against pulling in different directions. This is gained by a two-step back-and-forth spinning pattern during the rapid production of the adhesive plaque, which shifts the thread insertion point towards the plaque centre and forms a flexible tree root-like network of branching fibres around the loading point. Using a morphometric approach and a tape-and-thread model we show that neither area, nor width of the plaque, but the shift of the loading point towards the plaque centre has the highest effect on pull-off resistance. This is explained by a circular propagation of the delamination crack with a low peeling angle. We further show that silken attachment discs are highly directional and adjusted to provide maximal performance in the upstream dragline. These {{results show that the}} way the glue is applied, crucially enhances the toughness of the anchorage without the need of additional material intake. This work is a starting point to study the evolution of tough and universal thread anchorages among spiders, and to develop bioinspired ‘instant’ anchorages of thread- and cable-like structures to a broad bandwidth of substrates. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The foot of pulmonate {{gastropods}} {{adheres to}} the surface upon which the <b>animal</b> crawls, the <b>adhesive</b> being {{a thin layer of}} pedal mucus. The power for locomotion in these animals is provided by rhythmic muscular con-tractions (pedal waves) on the ventral surface of the foot, and the force due to these waves is coupled to the substratum by the pedal mucus. Movement of the animal is consequently a result of a balance of forces: if the reactive force provided by the adhesive beneath the stationary portions of the foot is sufficient to offset the frictional force caused by portions of the foot moving forward, the animal is able to crawl. Mechanisms previously proposed to explain this adhesive crawling require that the frictional resistance to forward movement be minimized by the foot being lifted during the passage of a pedal wave. This lifting, however, cannot be reconciled with the properties of the pedal mucus and epithelium, and the terrestrial slug, Ariolimax columbianus, is shown to not lift its foot when crawling. A new mechanism is proposed which does not require lifting of the foot and explains several difficulties inherent in previous studies. Based on this mechanism and the mechanical properties of pedal mucus, a quantitative model is constructed which predicts the frictional and reactive forces, and these predictions are tested against force measurements made under crawling slugs. The model accurately predicts the magnitude of forces under slugs crawling horizontally, but is less accurate in predicting forces under slugs crawling vertically...|$|R
40|$|Adhesive {{systems are}} {{ubiquitous}} in benthic animals {{and play a}} key role in diverse functions such as locomotion, food capture, mating, burrow building, and defence. For benthic <b>animals</b> that release <b>adhesives,</b> surface and material properties and external morphology have received little attention compared to the biochemical content of the adhesives. We address temporary adhesion of benthic animals from the following three structural levels: (a) the biochemical content of the adhesive secretions, (b) the micro- and mesoscopic surface geometry and material properties of the adhesive organs, and (c) the macroscopic external morphology of the adhesive organs. We show that temporary adhesion of benthic animals is affected by three structural levels: the adhesive secretions provide binding to the substratum at a molecular scale, whereas surface geometry and external morphology increase the contact area with the irregular and unpredictable profile of the substratum from micro- to macroscales. The biochemical content of the adhesive secretions differs between abiotic and biotic substrata. The biochemistry of the adhesives suitable for biotic substrata differentiates further according to whether adhesion must be activated quickly (e. g. as a defensive mechanism) or more slowly (e. g. during adhesion of parasites). De-adhesion is controlled by additional secretions, enzymes, or mechanically. Due to deformability, the adhesive organs achieve intimate contact by adapting their surface profile to the roughness of the substratum. Surface projections, namely cilia, cuticular villi, papillae, and papulae increase the contact area or penetrate through the secreted adhesive to provide direct contact with the substratum. We expect that the same three structural levels investigated here will also affect the performance of artificial adhesive systems...|$|R
40|$|These {{are three}} large format bound volumes of prints, each 77 x 56 cm, made {{especially}} for the Medieval and Historical Bindings in a Modern Design exhibition at Dominik Rostworowski Gallery, Krakow, Poland, May 2006. The research field is bookbinding for a volume of Gus Mazzocca’s prints using ‘lost’ techniques derived from codicology, particularly medieval binding associated with Anton Koburger. Supported by the Academy of the Arts in Krakow, this practice-based research sought to present images by the experimental printmaker Mazzocca as framed prints and contained within a book. A number of medieval bookbinders have developed a flexible binding technique with Anton Koburger, active in Nuremburg between 1478 and 1515, being a focus of study. The conclusion drawn was that for the volume to open flat the boards had to be stable and the spine needed to be round not flat (a relative rarity in medieval bindings). The <b>adhesive</b> (<b>animal</b> glue) needed to be used fresh as it quickly dries, although modern PVA adhesives obviate this difficulty. Linen tapes were laced in and the stitches kept tight. At each tape station the needle dropped down to catch the previous thread. Thread may have been pierced to prevent it running from the needle and silk thread, though used, left openings. Dividers may have been employed for measuring the vellum prior to cutting. Bone folders were commonly used to assist in adhering the vellum to the boards without creasing. These were the major principles that informed the binding of Mazzocca’s prints. The volume withstood many openings during the exhibition at the Dominic Rostworowski Gallery without any damage. It could even be opened board-to-board, permitting unimpeded visual access to the viewer. Three copies were made (now in the collections of University of Connecticut, University of the Arts London, the third with the researcher) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{adhesive}} and adhesive glands of the stalked barnacle Lepas anatifera {{were investigated}} using {{a wide range}} of techniques to characterise them and compare them to distantly related acorn barnacles, as well as other adhesive models such as mussels, tubeworms and echinoderms. Live samples of L. anatifera were collected from Irish coastal waters and maintained in a laboratory aquarium. Histochemical and immunological analyses showed that the adhesive production system in barnacles was unique compared to other <b>adhesive</b> <b>animal</b> models and showed that, within the body, the adhesive is slightly acidic, contains some carbohydrate and does not contain L- 3. 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine or phosphorylated serines. Ultrastructural analyses revealed a series of single celled adhesive glands, drained by ever-larger canals. The first, the intracellular canal, is immediately adjacent to the gland cell cytoplasm and responsible for transferring the secretion granules across the cell membrane through apocrine and merocrine processes. Once they had been released from the gland cell cytoplasm, the adhesive components were completely unbound by granular membranes {{as they made their way}} through the adhesive drainage system. These observations raise questions about how premature hardening of the adhesive is prevented. Because of their relatively large size, it was possible to elementally map the gland cells for the first time using SEM-EDS. These analyses showed that the gland cells had a far less varied elemental composition than the adhesive. A wider range of elements than has been recorded previously was observed in the adhesive, although some of these were probably environmental contaminants. Elements were sometimes variable, for example, phosphorus was sometimes present in the gland but mostly absent from the adhesive. Sulfur was absent from the gland but always present in the adhesive. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy indicated that the sulfur content of the adhesive was not present in disulfide form. Spectroscopic analyses confirmed the absence of phosphorylated proteins and protein-metal interactions. CaCO 3 involvement in barnacle adhesion was also ruled out but Raman spectroscopy showed a signal consistent with tyrosine in the adhesive. There were marked differences in Raman spectra between stalked and acorn species. The hardened adhesive was solubilised most successfully by increasing the amount of urea/thiourea buffer prior to 1 D SDS-PAGE. Approximately 12 bands were observed ranging in size from less than 20 kD to 200 kD. Repeating 1 D SDS-PAGE showed consistent bands at 30, 70, 80, 90, 110 kD. Mass spectrometry of these protein bands showed no significant similarity to any known proteins, including published barnacle adhesive proteins. De novo sequencing of adhesive protein bands produced seventy-eight peptide fragments of up to 16 amino acids in length. The longest de novo sequences (more than 11 amino acids) were subjected to multiple BLAST analyses and compared to translated cDNA open reading frame sequences from a transcriptome of Amphibalanus amphitrite and an unpublished database for Tetraclita, but these returned no matches. Several of the de novo sequences were repeated across several of the bands that were analysed, indicating possible multiple variants of the same protein. There was some limited similarity in the protein size bands and peptide sequences of L. anatifera and related species Dosima fascicularis, but less similarity to size ranges of acorn barnacle proteins. All attempts to amplify adhesive protein genes using PCR with primers based on de novo peptide sequences were unsuccessful. Immunohistochemical assays using polyclonal antibodies raised against acorn barnacle adhesive proteins resulted in positive reactions in L. anatifera adhesive gland tissue for two out of the three proteins tested, suggesting that some homology exists between stalked and acorn barnacle adhesive. However, extensive attempts to isolate adhesive protein genes from L. anatifera cDNA using primers based on acorn barnacle adhesive protein gene alignments, as well as acorn and stalked barnacle cDNA sequences for adhesive genes, were unsuccessful. Homology between acorn barnacles and Pollicipes pollicipes sequences ranged from 26 % to 36 % depending on the gene. Overall, there were strong distinctions between the adhesives of distantly related (different taxonomic order) barnacle species. The overall picture which emerges is one where the functional homology of barnacle proteins does not strictly depend on the characteristics of size, pI or primary sequence similarity...|$|R
