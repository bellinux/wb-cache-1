During the sessions, they had problems during sequencing, and, as a result, Pettibone kept trying to move development <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> possible as he did not want Madonna to lose interest in the music. According to him, Madonna's compositions were serious and intense, directing the creative direction of the songs into a deeply personal territory.|$|E
