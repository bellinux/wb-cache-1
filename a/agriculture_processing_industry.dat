Conditions for {{further development of}} the Region are its suitable position, transport accessibility, developed infrastructure, enough qualified labour force and entry of foreign investors. In 2011 the total economically active population of the Olomouc Region was 307.2 thousand people, of which 283.9 thousand were employed and 23.3 thousand unemployed. The unemployment rate in late 2013 was 9%. The Olomouc Region is an industrial area with developed services. The economy of theHanakian districts is more stable and diverse than {{the economy of the}} Jeseník District and northern part of the Šumperk District. The letter two districts belong to economically weaker regions due to their position, transport accessibility and disturbance of social and economic life after the Second World War (displacement of German population).The gross domestic product of the Olomouc Region amounted to 4.7% of the nation GDP in 2011. The GDP per capita of the region reaches 76.5% of the national average. The average monthly wage of employees in businesses based in the region reached 21,727 CZK (EUR 780) in late 2013.Significant sectors of the region’s economy are agriculture, food industry, textile and clothing industry, manufacture of machinery, optics and optical equipment.In 2011, there were 138,970 businesses, organisations and entrepreneurs based in the region. Most of them were private entrepreneurs registered according to the trade law (76.6%) and business companies (8.4%). 157 industrial enterprises had 100 or more employees, employing in total 41,222 employees.|$|E

While the data analysis controlling techniques using data analysis techniques Location Quotient (LQ) and Shift Share. Based on the analysis of LQ had known there are two economic sectors in Lumajang with a comparative of East Java in the mark with LQ greater than one, namely Agriculture (1. 93), multiplication (1. 69), construction (1. 36) and services (1. 14). This means that the sector role has large contribution in the economic sector of Lumajang, so it can be a motivator for developing other sectors. From the analysis of the dominant sector for the year 2004 ­ 2007 are agriculture, mining, construction, and services. From the Shift share calculations, there were four dominant sectors. That sector has a competitive advantage for four consecutive years (2004 ­ 2007) which includes <b>agriculture,</b> <b>processing</b> <b>industry,</b> trade and services.

Despite their apparent simplicity in design, the transportation action is very complex for design and constructors have tended to rely heavily on empirical performance data. Screw conveyor performance is affected by its operating conditions (such as: the rotational speed of the screw, the inclination of the screw conveyor, and its volumetric fill level). In this paper, horizontal, several single-pitch screw conveyors with some geometry variations in screw blade was investigated for mixing action during transport, using Discrete Element Method (DEM). The influence of geometry modifications {{on the performance of}} screw conveyor was examined, different screw designs were compared, and the effects of geometrical variations on mixing performances during transport were explored. During the transport, the particle tumbles down {{from the top of the}} helix to the next free surface and that segment of the path was used for auxiliary mixing action. The particle path is dramatically increased with the addition of three complementary helices oriented in the same direction as screw blades (1458. 2 mm compared to 397. 6 mm in case of single flight screw conveyor) Transport route enlarges to 1764. 4 mm, when installing helices oriented in the opposite direction from screw blades.

To this end there has been carried out questionnaire in 2006, 2009 and 2012, the sample - quota, the sample size - more than 1, 000 people. The analysis of empirical material used the research “Monitoring {{the quality of life of}} the population of the Stavropol Territory” (2014). Comparative analysis of the data allows to suggest a narrowing of the labor market being accompanied by the outflow of labor, especially the young, and by the expansion of the share of pensioners.

In the South-East Region, the dynamics of the active population decreased – as it did at national level – from 1, 276 in 2004 to 1, 240 thousand people in 2009. The declining trend affects both the population structure on residential areas and on sexes. The reduced active population is an obvious sign of a low activity rate with long-term effects on the economy of the region. On analysing the structure of the active population on residential areas, one can notice a slight increase in the urban active population: 708 thousand people in 2009 compared to 694 thousand people in 2003. However, the rural active population is decreasing permanently, 732 thousand people in 2009 compared to 586 thousand people in 2003. A significant decline was also visible in the employed population both at regional and national level: from 1, 151 in 2004 to 1, 151 in 2009. The regional and national dynamics of the employed population on residential areas is decreasing chiefly because of the decline in the rural employed population, which decreased with 20, 000 people from 2009 to 2004.
