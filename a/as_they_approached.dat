5|$|Lladron Maelrhys are {{two large}} stones {{on the border}} between Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw. It is claimed that, years ago, thieves broke into St Maelrhys Church, intent on {{stealing}} money. Caught in the act, they fled for their lives but were caught <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>approached</b> Y Rhiw, and killed on the spot; the stones mark their burial place. Another version claims that as they crossed the parish boundary they were turned to stone for their sacrilege.|$|E
5|$|Orme {{then took}} on older {{horses in the}} {{valuable}} Lancashire Plate, where he started the 7/4 favourite. In the last few furlongs Orme challenged the four-year-old Signorina for the lead, and <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>approached</b> the main stand, Martagon challenged the pair. Orme drew level with Signorina, but the filly edged away slightly again and won an exciting race by half a length from Orme, Martagon a head back in third. Orme received £1000 for finishing second.|$|E

5|$|A {{group of}} thieves stole, {{on a summer}} day, horses {{that belonged to the}} Monastery of StJovan Vladimir. When they came to the nearby stream of Kusha to take the horses across, it {{appeared}} to them like an enormous river. They moved away from it in fear, but when they looked back from a distance, the stream appeared small. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>approached</b> it again, the Kusha again became huge and impassable. After several such attempts to cross the stream, the thieves realized that this was a miracle of the saint, so they released the monastery's horses and ran away in horror.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{smell of}} burning {{was present in}} the Lords' {{chambers}} during the afternoon of 16 October, and at 4:00pm two gentlemen tourists visiting to see the Armada tapestries that hung there were unable to view them properly because of the thick smoke. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>approached</b> Black Rod's box {{in the corner of}} the room, they felt heat from the floor coming through their boots. Shortly after 4:00pm Cross and Furlong finished work, put the last few sticks into the furnaces—closing the doors as they did so—and left to go to the nearby Star and Garter public house.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{involved}} in the 1914 Second Battle of Vera Cruz, deploying their Marine contingents as part of the operation. Following the entrance of the United States into World War I in 1917, both ships were deployed to Europe. Florida was assigned to the British Grand Fleet and based in Scapa Flow; in December 1918 she escorted President Woodrow Wilson to France for the peace negotiations. Utah was assigned to convoy escort duty; she was based in Ireland and was tasked with protecting convoys <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>approached</b> the European continent.|$|E

5|$|By 22 May Chacal was {{reassigned to}} the 2nd DCT when the unit was tasked to carry {{demolition}} teams to the northernmost French ports; the ship arrived at Calais that evening. Together with Léopard and eight smaller destroyers, Chacal bombarded advancing German troops <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>approached</b> the defenses of Boulogne-sur-Mer throughout the 23rd. During {{the night of}} 23–24 May, the ship was badly damaged by bombs from Heinkel He 111 bombers and shells from German artillery {{and had to be}} beached between Ambleteuse and Wimereux lest she sink.|$|E
5|$|Giampaolo Caruso led {{the group}} into Ans and towards the {{climb to the}} finish. At {{the foot of the}} climb, Daniel Moreno, Caruso's teammate, {{attacked}} and built a small gap ahead of the group. The group did not initially chase him, as all the other riders looked for Valverde to do the work. Eventually Valverde did start to chase Moreno and caught him at the final bend. He opened his sprint from a long way out, with Joaquim Rodríguez (Katusha) right behind him. Rodríguez slowed <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>approached</b> the line, however, and Valverde took the victory. Julian Alaphilippe came around Rodríguez in the final metres to take second place.|$|E
5|$|Mortier {{accepted}} the bait of a rumored Russian retreat. In {{the early morning}} of 11 November he and Gazan departed from Dürenstein to seize Stein and Krems, presuming the Russians had either abandoned the settlements or left only a small rear-guard behind. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>approached</b> Stein, a column of Miloradovich's troops attacked the French forward positions. Thinking this force was the rumored Russian rear guard, Mortier ordered Gen. Gazan to counterattack and push east towards the town of Stein. Fighting spread though the villages of Oberloiben, Unterloiben and the farm at Rothenhof. Instead of withdrawing, as a rear guard would, more and more Russian troops appeared and engaged the French column.|$|E

5|$|Not all mating {{takes place}} at the lek, since only a {{minority}} of the males attend an active lek. As alternative strategies, males can also directly pursue females ("following") or wait for them <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>approached</b> good feeding sites ("intercepting"). Males switched between the three tactics, being more likely to attend a lek when the copulation rate the previous day was high or when fewer females were available after nesting had started. Lekking rates were low in cold weather early in the season when off-lek males spent most of their time feeding.|$|E
5|$|The Romans were {{in front}} of the hill leading to Cannae and hemmed in on their right flank by the Aufidus River, so that their left flank was the only viable means of retreat. In addition, the Carthaginian forces had maneuvered so that the Romans would face east. Not only would the morning sun shine low into the Romans' eyes, but the southeasterly winds would blow sand and dust into their faces <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>approached</b> the battlefield. Hannibal's unique {{deployment}} of his army, based on his perception of the terrain and understanding of the capabilities of his troops, proved decisive.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} {{launched}} on 7 July 1810 as two combined forces of British sailors, soldiers, sepoys and Royal Marines landed at separate beaches. Although {{a number of}} men were drowned in the heavy surf, {{the majority of the}} invasion force reached the beaches safely and marched inland, attacking French outposts <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>approached</b> the capital. Recognising that his demoralised garrison would be unable to defend Saint Denis and that the militia would take too long to mobilise, the French commander Colonel Chrysostôme de Sainte-Suzanne surrendered the island, its garrison and its stores to Rowley.|$|E

5|$|This forced Tiridates {{to confront}} the Romans with his army, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>approached</b> Artaxata. The Roman force, {{reinforced}} by a vexillatio of X Fretensis, marched in a hollow square, with the legions supported by auxiliary horsemen and foot archers. The Roman soldiers were under strict orders not to break formation, and despite repeated probing attacks and feigned retreats by the Parthian horse archers, they held together until nightfall. During the night, Tiridates withdrew his army, abandoning his capital; its inhabitants promptly surrendered and were allowed to leave unmolested, but the city was torched, since the Romans could not spare sufficient men for garrisoning it.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{receiving}} notification, the OAEP {{sent two}} officers to investigate, {{who met the}} doctors and patients at the hospital shortly after noon on 18 February. After questioning the scrapyard owner, they searched for the cylindrical metal pieces initially suspected to be the radiation source, but found {{that they were not}} radioactive. They then headed to the scrapyard, and noted abnormally high levels of radiation <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>approached,</b> late in the evening. At the scrapyard entrance they measured radiation at an equivalent dose of 1 millisievert per hour (mSv/h) and decided to request additional assistance.|$|E
5|$|A Company was not {{significantly}} delayed by the German patrols it encountered later, although the presence of cheering Dutch crowds delayed the whole battalion as it passed through Oosterbeek. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>approached</b> the railway bridge, C Company detached to capture it, but German engineers blew the bridge just as the British were starting to cross it. A Company now encountered enemy armoured cars, but successfully skirted them by manoeuvering through the back gardens of the houses {{on either side of}} the road At 8pm, as darkness fell, Grayburn's platoon led A Company into Arnhem centre and under the main ramp of Arnhem road bridge. Tatham-Warter deployed his platoons around the ramp; 2 Platoon covered both sides of the northernmost extreme of the ramp where it fed into the town centre.|$|E

5|$|After a short halt {{to leave}} their baggage train behind and form a battle line the Persian army quickly {{advanced}} on the Byzantines, shooting arrows <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>approached.</b> The Byzantines responded in kind and then sallied forth to meet the oncoming enemy. On the Byzantine right Vitalius was quickly victorious, his heavy cavalry breaking through the Persian flank and pushing his opponents to the left behind their own main line. At this point, however, disaster threatened as many of Vitalius' troopers broke formation and headed towards the enemy camp, intending to loot it. Philippicus, however, saw {{what had happened and}} reacted quickly. He gave his distinctive helmet to one of his bodyguards, Theodore Ilibinus, and sent him to rally the cavalry on pain of punishment by the army commander himself. The ruse worked: the men recognized the helmet and returned to order just in time to stop the Persians, who had regrouped in the centre and were pushing the numerically inferior Byzantines back.|$|E
5|$|Anderson met Todd and Quantrill on September 24, 1864; {{although}} they had clashed in the past, they agreed to work together. Anderson suggested that they attack Fayette, Missouri, targeting the 9th Missouri Cavalry, which was based at the town. Quantrill disliked the idea because the town was fortified, but Anderson and Todd prevailed. Clad in Union uniforms, the guerrillas generated little suspicion <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>approached</b> the town, {{even though it had}} received warning of nearby guerrillas. However, a guerrilla fired his weapon before they reached the town, and the cavalry quickly withdrew into their fort while civilians hid. Anderson and Todd launched an unsuccessful attack against the fort, leading charge after futile charge without injury. The defeat resulted in the deaths of five guerrillas but only two Union soldiers, further maddening Anderson.|$|E
5|$|By 20:00 {{that evening}} {{a large number}} of South Koreans were {{retreating}} in disarray through a gap in the line held by the brigade, the majority of them moving through the Australians. The South Korean 6th Division later regrouped in positions behind 27th Brigade, but was now reduced to less than half its original strength. Meanwhile, as the 20th Army veered to the west as part of the Chinese main effort against Seoul, the Chinese 118th Division continued its secondary advance down the Kapyong Valley, closely pursuing the retreating South Koreans. Racing down the northeast running valley, the 354th Regiment reached the Australian positions by about 22:00. Intent on capturing the important crossroads of Route 17 south of Kapyong, and most likely unaware of the location of the Australian blocking position, the Chinese vanguard remained in the low ground, splitting <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>approached</b> a long, low north-south running ridge that rose like an island in the mouth of the valley.|$|E
