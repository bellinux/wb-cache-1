5000|$|Full annealing: Carbon {{steel is}} heated to {{approximately}} 40 °C above Ac3 or Acm for 1 hour; this ensures all the ferrite transforms into austenite (although cementite might still exist if the carbon content {{is greater than}} the eutectoid). The steel must then be cooled slowly, in the realm of 20 °C (36 °F) per hour. Usually it is just furnace cooled, where the furnace is turned off with the steel still inside. This results in a coarse pearlitic structure, which means the [...] "bands" [...] of pearlite are thick. Fully <b>annealed</b> <b>steel</b> is soft and ductile, with no internal stresses, which is often necessary for cost-effective forming. Only spheroidized steel is softer and more ductile.|$|E
5000|$|Steel {{that has}} been heated above its upper {{critical}} temperature and then cooled in standing air is called normalized steel. Normalized steel consists of pearlite, martensite and sometimes bainite grains, mixed together within the microstructure. This produces steel that is much stronger than full-annealed steel, and much tougher than tempered quenched-steel. However, added toughness is sometimes needed at a reduction in strength. Tempering provides a way to carefully decrease the hardness of the steel, thereby increasing the toughness to a more desirable point. Cast-steel is often normalized rather than annealed, to decrease the amount of distortion that can occur. Tempering can further decrease the hardness, increasing the ductility to a point more like <b>annealed</b> <b>steel.</b> Tempering is often used on carbon steels, producing much the same results. The process, called [...] "normalize and temper", is used frequently on steels such as 1045 carbon steel, or most other steels containing 0.35 to 0.55% carbon. These steels are usually tempered after normalizing, to increase the toughness and relieve internal stresses. This can make the metal more suitable for its intended use and easier to machine.|$|E

The acoustic emission from the fatigue specimens was investigated prior to fatiguing, but no parameter of the emission was found to correlate significantly with fatigue life. The high-rate emission which occurs at yield is found to be useful in determining the value of the yield stress. The value of the stress into the plastic range determined in this manner was defined by both statistical approaches as the best predictor of fatigue life. The fatigue stress level was rejected as a lesser predictor. Surface finish in the range of 90 to 350 μin. was found to have little correlation with fatigue life of this material...|$|E

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{examining}} {{of the effect of}} microstructure on the Bauschinger effect and the relation between the Bauschinger effect and the work hardening, experiments were carried out on a mild steel in tension-compression and reverse torsion tests. 　The <b>annealed</b> <b>steel</b> is composed of the alternate layers of ferrites and pearlites along the rolling axis, which is called the ferrite band structure. The pearlites of specimen are spheroidized and dispersed uniformiy in the ferrite matrix by tempering. The influence of the distribution of second phase particles {{on the development of the}} Bauschinger effect was examined on comparing the reverse loading curves of the annealed and the spheroidized. The transient softening of the Bauschinger effect in the <b>annealed</b> <b>steel</b> is larger in reverse torsion than in tension-compression. On the other hand, the Bauschinger effect in the spheroidized steel is much the same in both cases. Hence the ferrite band structure has an effect on the development of the Bauschinger effect. 　As it can be considered that the work hardening of spheroidized steel depends on the dispersed cementites, the dispersion hardening theory proposed by Fisher et. al. applies to the experimental results and the quantitative relation between the Bauschinger effect and the work hardening is obtained. It was shown that the permanent softening of the Bauschinger effect corresponds to the work hardening...|$|E

40|$|In warm rolled steels, the {{intensity}} of the //ND annealing texture, which favours formability, has been related to the formation of shear bands during rolling. Coarse hot band grain sizes (HBGS's) facilitate flow localization, the mechanism associated with the formation of shear bands. In this work, the effect of grain size after hot rolling was studied in a low carbon steel containing small additions of Cr and Mn. The formation of shear bands and their subsequent influence on the normal anisotropy r(m) and planar anisotropy Delta r in the <b>annealed</b> <b>steels</b> were of particular interest. Two HBGS's (18 and 30 mu m) were employed and the specimens were warm rolled to reductions of 65 and 80 % at various temperatures between 640 and 700 degrees C.

Similar plateaus were discovered by N. S.

For the three states described (melt, austenite, mixed phase) the anomalies of properties at ~ 0. 5 % С should be denoted in some compact way, ascribing them, for example the formula of interim phase of ~ Fe 42 C.

40|$|In this presentation, {{the effect}} of higher heating rate in {{continuous}} annealing on microstructure and mechanical properties of a cold-rolled 590 [*]MPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase steel were investigated by using microstructural observation and mechanical property measurement. The results show that compared with the conventional continuous <b>annealed</b> <b>steels</b> heated {{at a rate of}} 5 [*]∘C/s (CA), the average ferrite grain sizes heated at a higher rate (300 [*]∘C/s, HRA) was obviously refined from 15. 6 μm to 5. 3 μm.

Further, the level of damage, as measured by C-Scan and through-thickness microscopy remained roughly constant as the impact energy was increased. However, the size of the hole formed increased. This suggested that the energy transferred to the target in the velocity range of interest became independent of the delamination.
