5|$|Abraham Lincoln's service {{during the}} Black Hawk War {{has been a}} source of {{discrepancies}} and questioning, with two major battle sites being affiliated with Lincoln in the aftermath of combat.

One of the soldiers in the company was Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln assisted with the burial and later made a statement about the experience that has been connected with both the battle at Kellogg's Grove <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> at Stillman's Run.|$|E
5|$|After {{his playing}} and {{managing}} days, Speaker was an entrepreneur and salesman. By 1937, Speaker had opened a wholesale liquor business {{and worked as}} a state sales representative for a steel company. He chaired Cleveland's boxing commission between 1936 and 1943. Newspaper coverage credited Speaker with several key reforms to boxing in Cleveland, including the recruitment of new officials and protections against fight fixing. Under Speaker, fight payouts went directly to boxers rather than managers. Speaker sorted out a scheduling conflict for a 1940 boxing match in Cleveland involving former middleweight champion Teddy Yarosz. Yarosz defeated Jimmy Reeves in ten rounds <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> attracted over 8,300 spectators.|$|E

5|$|The stunt {{crew was}} the same one used in Cruise's Mission: Impossible 2, and was {{responsible}} for complex action scenes.

Industrial Light & Magic {{did most of the}} special effects, and DreamWorks-owned PDI was responsible for the Spyder robots. The company Pixel Liberation Front did previsualization animatics. The holographic projections and the prison facility were filmed by several roving cameras which surrounded the actors, and the scene where Anderton gets off his car and runs along the Maglev vehicles was filmed on stationary props, which were later replaced by computer-generated vehicles.|$|E
5|$|A {{major element}} of the plot {{is based on the}} wuxia film series Palm of Ru Lai (如來神掌), {{released}} in 1964. Sing studied the fighting style used in Palm of Ru Lai ("Buddhist Palm style"), from a young age and used it at the end of Kung Fu Hustle. In reality, the Buddhist Palm fighting style does not leave palm-shaped craters and holes on impact. Instead, the user delivers powerful punches using his palm. The Beast's name in Chinese, Huoyun Xieshen (火雲邪神; Evil Deity of the Fiery Cloud), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> with the Landlady and her husband are also references to the Palm of Ru Lai, in which a mortally wounded master strikes the patterns of his art's final techniques into a bell so that his apprentice can learn from it. Kung Fu Hustle also contains direct references to characters from Louis Cha's wuxia novels. For example, the landlord and landlady refer to themselves as Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü, the names of characters in Cha's The Return of the Condor Heroes, when they met the Beast.|$|E

5|$|He {{believed}} {{that he and his}} men had secured Dai Do and wasn't expecting a sudden massive counterattack by the NVA. Company G took cover in the village cemetery <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> raged through the night. The next morning, the bodies of more than three hundred enemy soldiers lay near their positions. Vargas's battalion commander arrived on the scene and ordered a renewed assault on the village. He carried to safety a Marine whose arm had been severed, and when the soldier pleaded for his arm, Vargas went back and found it. When the battalion commander, fighting like any other rifleman, was shot in the back three times, Vargas dragged him a hundred yards to an evacuation point, firing at the enemy as he went with an AK-47 he had picked up on the battlefield. By {{the end of the third}} day of battle, the North Vietnamese retreated and Vargas finally allowed himself to be treated for a bullet wound in his side and shrapnel from mortar blasts.|$|E
5|$|On August 2, 2008, Judah lost to Joshua Clottey by {{technical}} {{decision in}} a fight for the vacant IBF Welterweight title at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. Judah began the busier fighter, showing quick hands and throwing effective combinations behind a jab. Clottey began steadily closing the distance between himself and his opponent from the third round, landing {{an increasing number of}} punches that took their toll on Judah. In round four, Clottey landed an uppercut that caused Judah to lose his balance, {{and by the end of}} the round, Judah had blood running down his nose. Judah staged a comeback in the sixth round, but in the middle of the seventh round, Clottey landed a right hand that hurt Judah and caused him to back into a corner. In round nine, Judah suffered a cut over his right eye <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> was stopped after he said he could not see.
