Juveniles frequent coastal shallows or lagoons, while adults occur in deeper water, with little overlap between the two age groups.|$|E
5|$|Another unusual feature {{found in}} the abyssal and hadal zones is the cold seep, {{sometimes}} called a cold vent. This {{is an area of}} the seabed where seepage of hydrogen sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid occurs, often {{in the form of a}} deep-sea brine pool. The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> of 3200meters in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, cold seeps have been discovered in many other areas of the World Ocean, including the Monterey Submarine Canyon just off Monterey Bay, California, the Sea of Japan, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, off the Atlantic coast of Africa, off the coast of Alaska, and under an ice shelf in Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|At a {{barometric}} pressure of 218 atmospheres, the critical point {{of water is}} 375°C. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> of 3,000meters, the {{barometric pressure}} of sea water is more than 300atmospheres (as salt water is denser than fresh water). At this depth and pressure, seawater becomes supercritical at a temperature of 407°C (see image). However the increase in salinity at this depth pushes the water closer to its critical point. Thus, water emerging from the hottest parts of some hydrothermal vents, black smokers and submarine volcanoes can be a supercritical fluid, possessing physical properties between those of a gas and those of a liquid.|$|E

5|$|Callisto is {{surrounded}} by an extremely thin atmosphere composed {{of carbon dioxide and}} probably molecular oxygen, as well as by a rather intense ionosphere. Callisto is thought to have formed by slow accretion from the disk of the gas and dust that surrounded Jupiter after its formation. Callisto's gradual accretion and the lack of tidal heating meant that not enough heat was available for rapid differentiation. The slow convection in the interior of Callisto, which commenced soon after formation, led to partial differentiation and possibly to the formation of a subsurface ocean <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> of 100150km and a small, rocky core.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{assessment}} of four sites occurred in 1997–98, Posiva chose the Olkiluoto site near two existing reactors, {{and the local}} government approved it in 2000. The Finnish Parliament approved a deep geologic repository there in igneous bedrock <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> of about 500 meters in 2001. The repository concept {{is similar to the}} Swedish model, with containers to be clad in copper and buried below the water table beginning in 2020.

Both rooms are rectangular in shape; the eastern room (L.6402) is 4 meters wide, more than 3,5 meters long (total length is unknown due to heavy damage) and west-east oriented. The western room (L.5762) is 5.20 meters long, 4 meters wide and west-east oriented.

5|$|The no {{decompression}} limit (NDL) or no stop time, is {{the interval}} that a diver may theoretically spend <b>at</b> <b>a</b> given <b>depth</b> {{without having to}} perform decompression stops.

5|$|Hatfield Moors is {{the site}} of a {{depleted}} onshore natural gas field located <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> of 1450 feet (440 metres) below Hatfield Moor. The field was discovered in 1981 and contained about 8.5 billion cubic feet (241 million cubic metres) of gas in two formations Hatfield Moors and Hatfield West. Production of gas started in 1986, and it was operated and owned by Edinburgh Oil & Gas plc. As the field became depleted plans were made by ScottishPower in 1998 to develop the field for the storage of gas. These facilities became operational in February 2000. Edinburgh Oil and Gas have a 25-year agreement with ScottishPower giving them exclusive rights to inject, store and withdraw gas.|$|E
5|$|PDISs are {{intermediate}} stops <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> {{above the}} depth {{at which the}} leading compartment for the decompression calculation switches from ongassing to offgassing and below {{the depth of the}} first obligatory decompression stop, (or the surface, on a no-decompression dive). The ambient pressure at that depth is low enough to ensure that the tissues are mostly offgassing inert gas, although under a very small pressure gradient. This combination is expected to inhibit bubble growth. The leading compartment is generally not the fastest compartment except in very short dives, for which this model does not require an intermediate stop.|$|E
5|$|The {{accretion}} process probably {{lasted for}} several thousand {{years before the}} moon was fully formed. Models suggest that impacts accompanying accretion caused heating of Ariel's outer layer, reaching a maximum temperature of around 195K <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> of about 31km. After the end of formation, the subsurface layer cooled, while the interior of Ariel heated due to decay of radioactive elements present in its rocks. The cooling near-surface layer contracted, while the interior expanded. This caused strong extensional stresses in the moon's crust reaching estimates of 30 MPa, which {{may have led to}} cracking. Some present-day scarps and canyons may be a result of this process, which lasted for about 200million years.|$|E

50|$|Temperatures are {{measured}} {{along the entire}} depth of the foundation. If records <b>at</b> <b>a</b> certain <b>depth</b> show regions with cooler temperatures (when compared to the average temperature <b>at</b> that <b>depth),</b> <b>a</b> concrete deficiency or defect may be present. An average temperature <b>at</b> <b>a</b> certain <b>depth</b> that is {{significantly lower than the}} average temperatures at other depths may also be indication of a potential problem. It is also possible to estimate the effective area of the foundation, and to assess if the reinforcing cage is properly aligned and centered.|$|R
5|$|The {{magnitude}} 5.7(Mw) earthquake occurred inland {{near the}} southern coast of Mexico <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> of 24km (14.9mi), {{with a duration of}} nearly one minute and an epicenter about 55km (34mi) west of Ometepec, Guerrero. In the region, the Cocos, North American, and Caribbean Plates converge and create a tectonic zone of continuous seismic activity. The quake struck near the eastern periphery of the Guerrero seismic gap, which extends from Acapulco to IxtapaZihuatanejo and contains enough seismic energy to generate an earthquake of up to magnitude 7.5, but it did not cause the gap to rupture. Initial estimates from the USGS placed its intensity at a magnitude of 5.8(Mw); the National Seismological Service registered the earthquake at magnitude 5.5(ML).|$|E
5|$|Abyssobrotula galatheae, {{a species}} of cusk eel in the family Ophidiidae, is among the deepest-living species of fish. In 1970, one {{specimen}} was trawled from a depth of 8370meters in the Puerto Rico Trench. The animal was dead, however, upon arrival at the surface. In 2008, the hadal snailfish (Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis) was observed and recorded <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> of 7700meters in the Japan Trench. These are, to date, the deepest living fish ever recorded. Other fish of the abyssal zone include the fishes of the Ipnopidae family, which includes the abyssal spiderfish (Bathypterois longipes), tripodfish (Bathypterois grallator), feeler fish (Bathypterois longifilis), and the black lizardfish (Bathysauropsis gracilis). Some members of this family have been recorded from depths of more than 6000meters.|$|E
5|$|Diamond-bearing rock {{is carried}} from the mantle to the Earth's surface by deep-origin {{volcanic}} eruptions. The magma {{for such a}} volcano must originate <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> where diamonds can be formed— or more (three times or more the depth of source magma for most volcanoes). This is a relatively rare occurrence. These typically small surface volcanic craters extend downward in formations known as volcanic pipes. The pipes contain material that was transported toward the surface by volcanic action, but was not ejected before the volcanic activity ceased. During eruption these pipes {{are open to the}} surface, resulting in open circulation; many xenoliths of surface rock and even wood and fossils are found in volcanic pipes. Diamond-bearing volcanic pipes are closely related to the oldest, coolest regions of continental crust (cratons). This is because cratons are very thick, and their lithospheric mantle extends to great enough depth that diamonds are stable. Not all pipes contain diamonds, and even fewer contain enough diamonds to make mining economically viable.|$|E

5|$|For example, (using {{the first}} formula (1) for {{absolute}} maximum breathing time), a diver <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> of 15 meters in water {{with an average}} density of 1020kg/m³ (typical seawater), who breathes {{at a rate of}} 20 litres per minute, using a dive cylinder of 18 litres pressurized at 200 bars, can breathe for a period of 72 minutes before the cylinder pressure falls so low as to prevent inhalation. In some open circuit scuba systems this can happen quite suddenly, from a normal breath to the next abnormal breath, a breath which may not be fully drawn. (There is never any difficulty exhaling). The suddenness of this effect depends on the design of the regulator and the internal volume of the cylinder. In such circumstances there remains air under pressure in the cylinder, but the diver is unable to breathe it. Some of it can be breathed if the diver ascends, as the ambient pressure is reduced, and even without ascent, in some systems a bit of air from the cylinder is available to inflate buoyancy compensator devices (BCDs) even after it no longer has pressure enough to open the demand valve.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{knowledge}} of the taxonomy, biogeography and natural history of deep sea communities prevents accurate assessment {{of the risk of}} species extinctions from large-scale mining. Data acquired from the abyssal North Pacific and North Atlantic suggest that deep-sea ecosystems may be adversely affected by mining operations on decadal time scales. In 1978, a dredge aboard the Hughes Glomar Explorer, operated by the American mining consortium Ocean Minerals Company (OMCO), made a mining track <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> of 5000meters in the nodule fields of the CCFZ. In 2004, the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (IFREMER) conducted the Nodinaut expedition to this mining track (which is still visible on the seabed) to study the long-term effects of this physical disturbance on the sediment and its benthic fauna. Samples taken of the superficial sediment revealed that its physical and chemical properties had not shown any recovery since the disturbance made 26 years earlier. On the other hand, the biological activity measured in the track by instruments aboard the manned submersible bathyscaphe Nautile did not differ from a nearby unperturbed site. This data suggests that the benthic fauna and nutrient fluxes at the water–sediment interface has fully recovered.|$|E
5|$|On {{arriving}} in Nassau, McClory searched for locations to shoot {{many of the}} key sequences of the film and used {{the home of a}} local millionaire couple, the Sullivans, for Largo's estate, Palmyra.

The most difficult sequences to film were the underwater action scenes; the first to be shot underwater was <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> of 50 feet to shoot the scene where SPECTRE divers remove the atomic bombs from the sunken Vulcan bomber. Peter Lamont had previously visited a Royal Air Force bomber station carrying a concealed camera which he used to get close-up shots of secret missiles (those appearing in the film were not actually present). Most of the underwater scenes had to be done at lower tides due to the sharks on the Bahamian coast.|$|E
