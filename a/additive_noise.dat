5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of noise is called <b>additive</b> <b>noise,</b> with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not <b>additive</b> <b>noise</b> is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E
25|$|A digital {{watermark}} is called robust {{with respect to}} transformations if the embedded information may be detected reliably from the marked signal, even if degraded by any number of transformations. Typical image degradations are JPEG compression, rotation, cropping, <b>additive</b> <b>noise,</b> and quantization. For video content, temporal modifications and MPEG compression often are added to this list. A {{digital watermark}} is called imperceptible if the watermarked content is perceptually equivalent to the original, unwatermarked content. In general, {{it is easy to}} create either robust watermarks—or—imperceptible watermarks, but the creation of both robust—and—imperceptible watermarks has proven to be quite challenging. Robust imperceptible watermarks have been proposed as a tool for the protection of digital content, for example as an embedded no-copy-allowed flag in professional video content.|$|E

There are various algorithms available for 2D or 3D deconvolution. They can be roughly classified in nonrestorative and restorative methods. While the nonrestorative methods can improve contrast by removing out-of-focus light from focal planes, only the restorative methods can actually reassign light to its proper place of origin. Processing fluorescent images in this manner can be an advantage over directly acquiring images without out-of-focus light, such as images from confocal microscopy, because light signals otherwise eliminated become useful information. For 3D deconvolution, one typically provides a series of images taken from different focal planes (called a Z-stack) plus the knowledge of the PSF, which can be derived either experimentally or theoretically from knowing all contributing parameters of the microscope.|$|E

This paper {{describes}} the continuous speech recognition {{performance in the}} car environments. Especially various kinds of phoneme models are evaluated. Since the speech recognition performance considerably degrades in the noisy environments, we must cope with this problem in the car environments. There are two primary factors which cause the degradation of the recognition performance. One is the <b>additive</b> <b>noises</b> such as the background noises, {{and the other is}} the multiplicative distortion such as the reverberation in the car cabin which is emphasized by the distance between a speaker and a microphone. In this paper, the phoneme models which take the <b>additive</b> <b>noises</b> and the multiplicative distortion into account are trained from the simulated speech data. When the car engine is off, the best word recognition rate is 98. 8 % for the multiplicative distortion phoneme model which is trained with the speech data generated by the multiplicative distortion simulation. When the car is in the running condition, the best recognition rate is 97. 2 % for the phoneme model which considers the multiplicative distortion and the <b>additive</b> <b>noises.</b> These results show the effectiveness of the phoneme models which are trained from the simulated speech database in the car environments...|$|R

A novel approach which imposes no constraints on the distribution or the color of noises is developed. It relies on fourth-order special cumulant or moment slices. The fourth-order moment spectrum is shown to have computational advantages over existing method. As a byproduct, the variance of the noises can also be estimated directly from the spectrum.
