40|$|We visited a breeding {{territory}} of the Greater Spotted Eagle (<b>Aquila</b> <b>clanga)</b> in Zavyalivskiy Wildlife Preserve of Altai Region on the 1 st August, 2014.

When we approached the nest, the female GSE flew off, followed by the fledgling of the Harrier, who uttered food-begging calls, but soon returned to the nest. The present situation possibly emerged after the adult eagle caught a nestling of the harrier but failed to kill it.

40|$|In Finland, the {{persecution}} of birds of prey was already encouraged in the Swedish State Law of 1734, and was first included in bounty schemes in the Royal Decree on Avian Pests in 1741. All species of Finnish raptors and owls were persecuted during 1898 – 1923, the most intense period of active bounty-paying by municipalities and hunting societies. Elimination of avian predators was regarded as reasonable game management, and was also justified on moral grounds. Since the late 19 th century, persecution of many species was questioned by professional biologists. We investigated the legal basis of persecution at different times, changes in attitudes towards birds of prey, and local and long-term im-pacts of persecution on population ranges and sizes in Finland. We found that in analysing the consequences of persecution, both the spatial and temporal scales of study are impor-tant. While populations of persecuted species may have dramatically declined at local scale, {{at the national level}} the ranges may have remained more or less stable. Active perse-cution had a severe short-term impact on many species: for example, the established bree-ding population of the Greater Spotted Eagle (<b>Aquila</b> <b>clanga)</b> was totally exterminated in the 1920 s. Active conservation measures have in recent decades compensated for the losses caused by earlier persecution. 1...|$|R

Conclusions The fact that some introgression still occurs on the Z-chromosome between these species suggests that the differentiation process is in a more premature phase in our study system than in previously studied avian species pairs and that could be explained by a shorter divergence time and/or a longer average generation time in the spotted eagles. The results are in agreement with field observations and provide further insight into the role of sex-linked loci for the build-up of barriers to gene flow among diverging populations and species. </p...|$|R
40|$|Greater {{and lesser}} spotted eagles (<b>Aquila</b> <b>clanga,</b> A. pomarina) are two closely related forest eagles {{overlapping}} in breeding range in east-central Europe. In recent years {{a number of}} mixed pairs have been observed, some of which fledged hybrid young. Here we use mitochondrial (control region) DNA sequences and AFLP markers to estimate genetic differentiation and possible gene flow between these species. In a sample of 83 individuals (61 pomarina, 20 clanga, 2 F 1 -hybrids) we found 30 mitochondrial haplotypes which, in a phylogenetic network, formed two distinct clusters differing on average by 3. 0 % sequence divergence. The two species were significantly differentiated both at the mitochondrial and nuclear (AFLP) genetic level. However, five individuals with pomarina phenotype possessed clanga-type mtDNA, suggesting occasional gene flow. Surprisingly, AFLP markers indicated that these "mismatched" birds (originating from Germany, E Poland and Latvia) were genetically intermediate between the samples of individuals in which mtDNA haplotype and phenotype agreed. This indicates that mismatched birds were either F 1 or recent back-cross hybrids. Mitochondrial introgression was asymmetrical (no pomarina haplotype found in clanga so far), which {{may be due to}} assortative mating by size. Gene flow of nuclear markers was estimated to be about ten times stronger than for mtDNA, indicating a sex-bias in hybrid fertility in accordance with Haldane's rule. Hybridization between the two species may be more frequent and may occur much further west than hitherto assumed. This is supported by the recent discovery of a mixed pair producing at least one fledgling in NE Germany...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of bird {{observations}} at four study sites with many different habitats in the western Chentej-mountains (forest steppe, taiga) {{at the end of}} the spring-migration and the beginning of the breeding time. Altogether 134 bird species were observed, about 107 of which are probably breeding birds. Additional birds were caught using 6 mist-nets. In this way 98 birds of 21 species were caught, measured, and ringed. Furthermore feathers have been collected (molting feathers and near two breeding places of Accipiter nisus). The bird fauna of the larch forests shows a high species richness (108 species), but the abundances are often very low (for instance for woodpeckers, thrushes, tits). Muscicapa griseisticta is a new record (possibly irregularly) as a migrating bird for Mongolia (11 - 6 - 1990 [i. e. June 11, 1990], Davaany Sörlög - three individuals in a willow-shrub near a railway).

50|$|The swamp lies {{on one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} bird migration routes in the world, and over 250 species of birds have been recorded in the area, including the globally vulnerable greater spotted eagle (<b>Aquila</b> <b>clanga),</b> eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), and lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni). Records of globally near-threatened bird species at the wetland include great snipe (Gallinago media), ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca) and pallid harrier (Circus macrourus). In addition to the great diversity of birds in the area, there are a wide variety of animals living in and around the marsh. Twenty-three species of mammals have been recorded, including jungle cat (Felis chaus) and European otter (Lutra lutra). Five species of amphibians and twelve species of reptiles have been recorded, and a two-year weekly butterfly survey found fifty-three species of butterflies in the area. The wetland lies 7 km SSW of the city of Qab Elias on the eastern edge of Mount Lebanon. The main area of reedbeds and open pools covers 253 ha, stretching east from the foot of the mountains to the Litani River in a long strip. Rain and snow falling on the high ridge of Barouk mountain to the west provide water for the wetland. Most rain falls between December and March, soaking quickly through layers of limestone in the mountains and emerging as springs in the valley floor. The water is particularly pure, as it has not been polluted by agricultural fertilizers, pesticides, etc. In recent years the marsh dried out by mid-July (with the exception of a few deep pools and ditches) and did not fill up again until January or February. However, the introduction by A Rocha's involvement of improved management techniques, such as the reduced pumping of water for irrigation of nearby farmland, and changes to less “thirsty” crops, has helped the marsh remain wet throughout the year. This has resulted in a significant increase in wintering and breeding water birds since 2002. Surrounding the open water and reed bed are areas of rough grazing, cultivated land, drainage ditches, and an avenue of trees, all adding to the diversity of habitats in the area. On the nearby mountain slopes, small wooded areas and rocky shrubland give an even greater variety of habitats and species. Behind the nearby village of Aammiq are woods where Syrian woodpecker (Dendrocopus syriacus) and Syrian serin (Serinus syriacus) can be found. In spring and summer, shrubby hillsides are home to assorted buntings, wheatears, warblers and shrikes, and rocky gorges host western rock nuthatch (Sitta neumayer) and Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo). Mammals present include Caucasian squirrel, wildcat, wild boar and the elusive Indian porcupine..The Aammiq Wetland and some of the surrounding area is in the process of being declared a National Reserve. The main landowning family is fully engaged in the preservation of this very important ecosystem and initial plans to develop the area for ecotourism are underway.|$|R
