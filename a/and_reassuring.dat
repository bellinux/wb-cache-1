As a result, the Prince makes an effort to appear {{simultaneously}} concerned <b>and</b> <b>reassuring.</b> When dessert is brought out, it's his favorite - a large, castle-shaped jelly. As dessert commences, the castle is essentially demolished before Don Paolo, the Prince's son and heir, {{gets a chance to}} have any.|$|E
25|$|Acts' third {{discussion}} of Paul's conversion occurs when Paul addresses King Agrippa, defending {{himself against the}} accusations of antinomianism {{that have been made}} against him. This account is more brief than the others. The speech here is again tailored for its audience, emphasizing what a Roman ruler would understand: the need to obey a heavenly vision, <b>and</b> <b>reassuring</b> Agrippa that Christians were not a secret society.|$|E

Street pastors work closely with councils and police in their local areas, but {{maintain}} an operational independence. Street pastors seek to maintain confidentiality so far as is legal, {{and do not have}} any powers of enforcement or arrest. Street pastors are expected to provide services unconditionally. The aim of Street Pastors is not to proactively preach or evangelise, but to provide a neutral <b>and</b> <b>reassuring</b> presence in local communities.|$|E

25|$|The de Gaulle {{family were}} very private. De Gaulle was deeply {{focussed}} on {{his career at}} this time. There {{is no evidence that}} he was tempted by fascism, and there is little evidence of his views either on domestic upheavals in 1934 and 1936 or the many foreign policy crises of the decade. He approved of the rearmament drive which the Popular Front government began in 1936-7, although French military doctrine remained that tanks should be used in penny packets for infantry support. A rare insight into de Gaulle's political views is a letter to his mother warning her that war with Germany was sooner or later inevitable <b>and</b> <b>reassuring</b> her that Pierre Laval’s pact with the USSR in 1935 was for the best, likening it to Francois I’s alliance with the Turks against the Emperor Charles V.|$|E
25|$|The {{role of the}} Assam Rifles {{continued}} to evolve when in 1950 a devastating earthquake hit the Assam region and the force {{was called in to}} assist in the reconstruction of the areas and help in the resettlement and rehabilitation of those affected by it. Later the force was once again called to undertake a combat role when, during the 1962 Sino-Indian War elements were used to delay the advancing Chinese forces so that the Indian Army could establish its defence lines. During this time and since then, the Assam Rifles also maintained their peacekeeping role in the northern areas of India in the face of growing tribal unrest and insurgency. In this environment the maintenance of law and order, countering insurgency <b>and</b> <b>reassuring</b> the people of the region became important tasks for the security forces and initially they fell to the Assam Rifles before the Army assumed control, and then later their experience and goodwill in the region was drawn upon in order to assist the army in conducting these tasks. In recognition of the unit's skill in counter insurgency operations, three battalions were deployed on Operation Pawan in Sri Lanka between December 1988 and February 1990.|$|E
25|$|Kat {{begins to}} have second {{thoughts}} about the divorce after Pam Coker (Lin Blakley) gives a speech about love and family. Stacey reveals to Alfie that their rent is increasing and Kat is struggling with money. Alfie then invites Kat to his flat for lunch and they reminisce about their relationship. The next day, Kat lashes out at Alfie for leaving leftovers for the children, but {{at the urging of}} Stacey, she agrees to be his date to Ian and Jane's wedding if he makes more effort for making up for the fire. On the wedding day, she gets heavily drunk, and during the reception, shoves Sonia Fowler's (Natalie Cassidy) head into the wedding cake. When the nursery raise their rates, Kat is forced to leave the children in Mo's care to work her shift at the market, but ends up having drinks with Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson). When Mo brings the children over to the pub, they misbehave and Kat is thrown out of the pub. Undeterred, Kat and Kim continue drinking and sneak into the pub to steal another bottle of wine. Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), catches them, and while Kim leaves to find the cash to pay for it, Linda prepares to call social services to tell them of Kat's irresponsibility as a mother, but Kat snatches Linda's phone and throws it across the ground. When Kim returns with Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), she confesses her fears about being a bad mother, resulting in the other three women sharing their experiences of motherhood <b>and</b> <b>reassuring</b> her. Kat also tells Linda to speak to Mick about her fears that the baby may not be his. Linda then realises that the phone call was still connected, and promises to fix things to make sure social services do not know about what happened, however Kat receives a call from a social worker requesting to visit her. Kat is surprised when a lawyer visits her about Harry telling her about a compensation case with four other women also raped by Harry.|$|E

500|$|A notable {{event at}} the Congress was the {{promotion}} of the policy of [...] "peaceful coexistence" [...] by Khrushchev, which officially was a policy to increase East-West collaboration against the threat of nuclear war, but which anti-revisionists believed [...] "was merely a way to divide the world in to spheres of influence inside which each side would enjoy unquestioned supremacy." [...] One anti-revisionist author described Khrushchev's policy as follows: [...] "Khrushchev {{made it clear that he}} was prepared to give up international class struggle, renouncing on behalf of the colonial peoples any right to liberate themselves from oppression <b>and</b> <b>reassuring</b> capitalist governments by emphasising 'peaceful transition to socialism' or the Parliamentary road..." [...] He then quoted Khrushchev as saying that [...] "'if any mad man wanted war, we , the two strongest countries in the world, would have but to shake our fingers to warn him off.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{central theme}} {{in almost all}} {{renditions}} of the narrative favouring the Mortara family was that of Marianna Mortara's health. From July 1858 onwards it was reported across Europe {{that as a result}} of her grief, Edgardo's mother had practically if not actually gone insane, and might even die. The powerful image of the heartbroken mother was stressed heavily in the family's appeals both to the public and to Edgardo himself. Momolo and the secretary of Rome's Jewish community, Sabatino Scazzocchio, told Edgardo that his mother's life was at risk if he did not come back soon. When Marianna wrote to her son in August, Scazzocchio refused to deliver the letter on the grounds that, being relatively calm <b>and</b> <b>reassuring</b> in tone, it might work against the impression they were trying to give him that she was no longer herself and that only his return could save her. One correspondent reported in January 1859: [...] "The father shows a great deal of courage, but the mother is having a hard time carrying on.... If the Holy Father had seen this woman as I saw her, he would not have the courage to keep her son another moment." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Come Running" [...] was {{described}} by Morrison as [...] "a very light type of song. It's not too heavy; it's just a happy-go-lucky song." [...] By contrast, Hinton found the song's sentiments tender and lustful in the vein of the 1967 Bob Dylan song [...] "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight". He argued that [...] "Come Running" [...] juxtaposed images of unstoppable nature—wind and rain, a passing train—against [...] "which human life and death play out their little games", which the narrator and his lover dream will not end [...] "while knowing of course it will". According to the writer, [...] "These Dreams of You" [...] manages to be simultaneously accusatory <b>and</b> <b>reassuring.</b> The lyrics cover such dream sequences as Ray Charles being shot down, paying dues in Canada, and [...] "his angel from above" [...] cheating while playing cards in the dark, slapping him in the face, ignoring his cries, and walking out on him. Morrison said he was inspired to write [...] "Brand New Day" [...] after hearing The Band on the radio playing either [...] "The Weight" [...] or [...] "I Shall Be Released": [...] "I {{looked up at the}} sky and the sun started to shine and all of a sudden the song just came through my head. I started to write it down, right from 'When all the dark clouds roll away'." [...] Yorke quoted Morrison as saying in 1973 that [...] "Brand New Day" [...] was the song that worked best to his ear and the one with which he felt most in touch.|$|E

2500|$|Most of the {{seizures}} are prolonged {{and half}} of them last more than 30 minutes thus constituting autonomic status epilepticus, which is the more common nonconvulsive status epilepticus in normal children. Characteristically, even after the most severe seizures and autonomic status epilepticus, the child is normal {{after a few hours}} of sleep, which is both diagnostic <b>and</b> <b>reassuring.</b> However, it has been recently reported that sometime after status epilepticus in children with Panayiotopoulos syndrome a. growth of the frontal and prefrontal lobes is slightly decreased and b.the scores on the neuropsychological tests is decreased.|$|E
2500|$|By Darger's own report, {{his father}} was kind <b>and</b> <b>reassuring</b> to him and they lived {{together}} until 1900. In that year, the crippled and impoverished Darger Sr. was taken to St. Augustine's Catholic Mission home and his son placed in a Catholic boys' home. Darger Sr. died in 1905, and his son was institutionalized in the Illinois Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children in Lincoln, Illinois, also called the Lincoln State School (today the Lincoln Developmental Center), with the diagnosis, according to Stephen Prokopoff, that [...] "little Henry's heart {{is not in the}} right place." [...] According to John MacGregor, the diagnosis was actually [...] "self-abuse," [...] a euphemism for masturbation.|$|E

2500|$|In 1963, the {{multi-part}} episode, [...] "The Journey" [...] was edited into {{a feature}} film called Lassie's Great Adventure. The show's three principal human stars appeared in their well known roles. In the film, Timmy and Lassie are swept away in a carnival hot air balloon which finally descends far from home in the Canadian wilderness. [...] The two travelers have several adventures before being rescued by the Mounties. [...] Paul's role is confined to keeping in touch with authorities <b>and</b> <b>reassuring</b> his wife that Timmy will be rescued. The couple fly to the wilderness to be at hand when Timmy is found. [...] Paul's image appeared on film posters and lobby cards. The episode was the only episode filmed in color during the Paul Martin seasons.|$|E
2500|$|Winnicott {{thought that}} the [...] "True Self" [...] begins to develop in infancy, in the {{relationship}} between the baby and its primary caregiver (Winnicott typically refers to this person as [...] "the mother"). One of the ways the mother helps the baby develop an authentic self is by responding in a welcoming <b>and</b> <b>reassuring</b> way to the baby's spontaneous feelings, expressions, and initiatives. In this way the baby develops a confidence that nothing bad happens when she expresses what she feels, so her feelings don't seem dangerous or problematic to her, and she doesn't have to put undue attention into controlling or avoiding them. She also gains a sense that she is real, that she exists and her feelings and actions have meaning.|$|E

Herman receives a note from Liza, asking him to meet her later. Tsurin and Chekalinsky sneak up behind him with the intent of playing a joke on him, muttering he is the [...] "third suitor" [...] who will learn the Countess's secret, then melt into the crowd as Herman wonders whether he is hearing things. The master of ceremonies announces a tableau of shepherdesses. Liza slips Herman the key to her grandmother's room, saying the old woman will not be there the next day, but Herman insists on coming that very night. Thinking fate is handing him the Countess' secret, he leaves. The guests' attention turns to the imminent arrival of Catherine the Great, for which a polonaise by O. Kozlovsky is played and sung in greeting.|$|E

During this chaotic time Max calls and asks to see Karen. They meet clandestinely in Boulogne and spend the day together. Max reveals that Mme Fisher believes her daughter is not good enough for him, but according to Max, Naomi is an acceptable match, simply because she is [...] "like the furniture or the dark", comfortable <b>and</b> <b>reassuring.</b> Ultimately, however, she evokes no passion in him. Likewise, Karen confides that she does not wish to marry Ray. They part, but meet again on Folkestone pier the following Saturday, spending the remainder of the day and evening in a hotel room. Karen awakens in the middle of the night and while examining her and Max's shared circumstances, she develops a type of unconscious awareness of Leopold, despite having no clear evidence he will eventually exist, suggested by the author in second person: [...] "All the same, the idea of you, Leopold, began to be present with her." ...|$|E
