Stores and business closed early after locals had stocked up on life supplies. Army troops were deployed in Port of Spain to avert looting. The {{threat of the}} storm caused a rise in unleaded oil prices. In Venezuela, boats were ordered to remain at port, while flights were canceled to Isla Margarita and Puerto la Cruz. Rescue workers were mobilized {{in the capital city}} of Caracas to prepare in the event of landslides. Ahead of the storm, the head of Sucre state declared a state of emergency, and later Caracas was placed under the same state once the rains began. According to the governor of Venezuela's capital district, local weather media expected the storm to only brush Caracas and surrounding areas; as a result, not all precautions were made. On August7, weather officials stated that the brunt of the storm had passed and that the storm was weakening; this was before the onslaught of the flooding rains. In neighboring Colombia, officials issued a wind and heavy rain warning in response to the storm. Towns shut off electricity along the coast and canceled flights. Later, about 1,000people evacuated from eastern Costa Rica, and another 40,000evacuated from portions of Nicaragua, Flights in the country were canceled due to the storm.|$|E

25|$|One {{interesting}} but short-lived {{operation was}} {{the development of}} the Swallow Doretti sports car. Only about 275 vehicles were made before complaints were received from T.I. clients in the car manufacturing business. Although it was a superior product to its competition, T.I. felt it might be politic not to aggravate some of the larger clients of its steel and aluminium business.

25|$|In 13 April 2016, Jordanian police raided <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> Muslim Brotherhood {{headquarters}} in Amman. This comes {{despite the fact}} that the Jordanian branch cut ties with the mother Egyptian group in January 2016, a designated terrorist organization, a move that is considered to be exclusively cosmetic by experts. Jordanian authorities state that the reason of closure is because that the Brotherhood is unlicensed and is using the name of the defectors' licensed group. This comes after the Jordanian senate passed a new legislation for the regulation of political parties in 2014, the Muslim Brotherhood did not adhere by the regulations of the new law and so they did not renew their membership.|$|E

He became the fifth Red Sox pitcher {{to win an}} opening day game in his debut for the ball club and the first since Pedro Martínez did it in 1998. Mookie Betts went deep in the third innings, scoring Jackie Bradley, Jr. and gave Boston an early 2–0 lead. In a four-hit inning, Cleveland brought two runners home and the game was tied {{at two in the}} bottom of the fourth. In the sixth, on a Travis Shaw single, Hanley Ramírez took third base from first, and scored on a Brock Holt blooper to left field. Travis Shaw took third on a Blake Swihart ground out and scored on a wild pitch by Corey Kluber. Junichi Tazawa and Koji Uehara retired all batters they faced in the seventh and eighth {{respectively}} and with Craig Kimbrel warming in the bullpen and Dustin Pedroia on first, David Ortiz hit his fifth opening day home run of his career, extending the lead to 6–2.

25|$|Enthused by {{the speech}} of Jathedar Tehal Singh, the entire Shaheedi Jatha {{followed}} him. By this time, another horseman messenger, Bhai Ram Singh, arrived. In vain did he too try to persuade Jathedar Tehal Singh and the Jatha to return. The Jatha soon entered Darshni Deohri of the Gurdwara <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> main door from inside. While some of the devotees took their seats inside the Prakash Asthan, others sat on the platform and the Baran dari. Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali sat on Guru's tabia. Mahant Narayan Das came to know of the situation through the Jaikaras (victory slogans) of the Shaheedi Jatha. At first, he was utterly shocked thinking that {{the game was over}} but he soon recovered and ordered his mercenaries to kill everyone in the Jatha. They fired bullets at the Sangat in Gurdwara hall. Several bullets pierced through Sri Guru Granth Sahib. The hired gundas wielded swords, spears, hatchets and other lethal weapons to mercilessly slaughter the peaceful and unprovocative Sikhs within the very premises of the Gurdwara. The dead and dying Singhs were then dragged to a pile of logs which had been collected earlier and consigned to flame. By the time the police and local Sikhs came on the scene, all the dead men had been consumed by the fire. Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali who was wounded with a gunshot was tied to a Jand tree and burnt alive. It was a butchery at its worst form.|$|E

500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I Stuart was called up to service, as {{an officer in the}} Royal Naval Reserve. He was originally posted as a junior officer on board the old and obsolete destroyer HMS Opossum in Plymouth. This ship was used for harbour patrols and intercepting neutral merchant ships and other work Stuart considered tedious. He became increasingly impatient with the life and repeatedly applied to his senior officers with requests for transfer; at one point he even requested that he be commissioned into the army.

500|$|Mansfield {{received}} her first starring film role as Jerri Jordan in Frank Tashlin's The Girl Can't Help It (1956). The film, originally titled Do-Re-Mi, featured a high-profile cast of contemporary Rock-n-Roll and R artists including Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, Fats Domino, The Platters, and Little Richard. The Girl Can't Help It {{was released in}} December 1956 {{and became one of}} the year's biggest successes, both critically and financially. Fox thereby bought Mansfield out of her Broadway contract for $100,000 ($ in [...] dollars) <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> production of Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? down after 444 performances. Soon afterwards, Fox started promoting Mansfield as [...] "Marilyn Monroe king-sized", in an effort to threaten Monroe to return to the studio and finish the contract she had committed to.|$|E
500|$|In November 2011, Walt Disney Pictures' {{president}} of production, Sean Bailey, was informed by executive Tendo Nagenda of Marcel's existing script. Realizing that the screenplay included a {{depiction of the}} studio's namesake, Bailey conferred with Disney CEO Bob Iger and Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn, the latter of whom referred to the film as a [...] "brand deposit," [...] a term adopted from Steve Jobs. Together, the executives discussed the studio's potential choices; purchase the script <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> project down, put the film in turnaround, or co-produce the film themselves. With executive approval, the studio acquired the screenplay in February 2012 and joined the production with Owen, Collie and Philip Steuer as producers, and Christine Langan, Troy Lum, Andrew Mason, and Paul Trijbits serving as executive producers. John Lee Hancock was hired to direct the film later that same month.|$|E
500|$|... "Sardines" [...] {{was written}} {{so that a}} feeling of {{claustrophobia}} would develop as the story progressed; Pemberton said that [...] "our first consideration was, 'Can we get 12 people in a wardrobe?' So when we did the script read-through, the designer bought a wardrobe off eBay and we checked whether we could all get in it <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> door". Writers for Broadcast described seeing the assortment of actors [...] "crammed inside an imposing wardrobe" [...] during filming as [...] "an arresting spectacle". The story is filmed from within a single bedroom, with much of it taking place inside the wardrobe. Filming presented a particular challenge, as {{the aim was to}} give the impression that the viewer was in the wardrobe with the characters, and not to [...] "cheat" [...] by giving the impression that the viewer was outside the wardrobe looking in. The episode was filmed with two wardrobes; one complete one, and one [...] "faked" [...] one. The complete prop was used to film the characters entering the wardrobe, while the other was in a different room for close-up shots from [...] "within" [...] the wardrobe. For director David Kerr, the difficulty was sustaining the illusion that everything was happening in a single place, ideally without viewers even realising that there was a technical challenge involved. The episode was filmed mostly in sequence, meaning more actors arrived as the filming continued, reflecting the fact that more characters arrive as the episode progresses. Kerr aimed for a particularly [...] "immersive" [...] filming style on the episode, with extensive use of wide angle shots. He aimed to avoid [...] "leading" [...] the audience with regards to the more important characters, by, for instance, [...] "not giving [...] coverage" [...] earlier in the episode.|$|E

500|$|The Battle of the Nile {{has been}} called [...] "arguably, the most decisive [...] naval {{engagement}} of the great age of sail", and [...] "the most splendid and glorious success which the British Navy gained." [...] Historian and novelist C. S. Forester, writing in 1929, compared the Nile to the great naval actions in history and concluded that [...] "it still only stands rivalled by Tsu-Shima {{as an example of}} the annihilation of one fleet by another of approximately equal material force". The effect on the strategic situation in the Mediterranean was immediate, reversing the balance of the conflict and giving the British control at sea that they maintained for the remainder of the war. The destruction of the French Mediterranean fleet allowed the Royal Navy to return to the sea in force, as British squadrons set up blockades off French and allied ports. In particular, British ships cut Malta off from France, aided by the rebellion among the native Maltese population that forced the French garrison to retreat to Valletta <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> gates. The ensuing Siege of Malta lasted for two years before the defenders were finally starved into surrender. In 1799, British ships harassed Bonaparte's army as it marched east and north through Palestine, and played a crucial part in Bonaparte's defeat at the Siege of Acre, when the barges carrying the siege train were captured and the French storming parties were bombarded by British ships anchored offshore. It was during one of these latter engagements that Captain Miller of Theseus was killed in an ammunition explosion. The defeat at Acre forced Bonaparte to retreat to Egypt and effectively ended his efforts to carve an empire in the Middle East. The French general returned to France without his army late in the year, leaving Kléber in command of Egypt.|$|E

2500|$|Much of Heller's prose in Catch-22 is {{circular}} and repetitive, exemplifying in {{its form}} {{the structure of}} a Catch-22.
