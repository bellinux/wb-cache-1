This study aimed to determine the level of recording of tobacco use (current and past) in Irish hospitals. Information on inpatient discharges with a tobacco use diagnosis was extracted from HIPE. In 2011, a quarter (n= 84, 679) of discharges had a recording of tobacco use, which were more common among males (29 % (n= 50, 161) male v. 20 % (n= 30, 162) female), among medical patients (29 % (n= 54, 375) medical v. 20 % (n= 30, 162) other) and was highest among those aged 55 - 59 years (30. 6 %; n= 7, 885). SLAN 2007 reported that 48 % of adults had smoked {{at some point in their}} lives. This study would suggest an under- reporting of tobacco use among hospital inpatients.

This article examines geographic disparity in <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> in Ontario, Canada, at three geographic levels of population and considers factors that may underlie variations in <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> across geographic areas. All-cause, sex and disease chapter specific <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> were analyzed at the regional, district and public health unit level {{to determine the extent}} of geographic variation. Standardized mortality ratios for persons aged 0 – 74 years were calculated to identify geographic areas with significantly higher or lower <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> than expected, using Ontario death rates as the basis for the calculation of expected deaths in the local population. Data are also presented from the household component of the 1996 / 97 National Population Health Survey and from the 1996 Statistics Canada Census. Results Results showed approximately 20 % higher than expected all-cause <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> for males and females in the North region. However, disparity in all-cause <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> in Ontario was most pronounced at the public health unit level, ranging from 20 % lower than expected to 30 % higher than expected. <b>Premature</b> <b>mortality</b> disparities were largely influenced by neoplasms, circulatory diseases, injuries and poisoning, respiratory diseases and digestive diseases, which accounted for more than 80 % of all <b>premature</b> deaths. <b>Premature</b> <b>mortality</b> disparities were also more pronounced for disease chapter specific mortality.

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} and its complications {{account for}} {{a high proportion of}} <b>avoidable</b> morbidity and <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> in people of South Asian origin living in the UK. This review examines available evidence as to why this might be {{and what can be done}} to address the problems. The sources for data were a Medline search by MeSH terms, free text and key authors by name, and relevant references, searched by hand, from all review articles in the AIM journals, up to April 1996. Most trials identified were epidemiological surveys. The high instance of diabetes and some of its complications do not have a single explanation. The early incidence of diabetes and its link with coronary heart disease may be partially explained by the central adiposity-insulin resistance syndrome. Predisposition to this is probably largely genetic but exacerbated by other factors such as diet, immune-inflammatory changes, and physical activity levels. There is less evidence to support conventional dietary risk factors and some for potentially deleterious effects of traditional Western dietary advice in this population. The impact of the genetic and environmental influences is exacerbated by suboptimal use of health services. The contribution of economic deprivation to the poor outcome of diabetes in these patients may be substantial. There is a considerable impact of psychosocial stress on morbidity, supporting the view that a narrow biomedical model will neither fully explain the problem nor provide solutions. To be successful, strategies for the secondary prevention of diabetes complications in British South Asians need to incorporate a number of paradigms: genetic, physiological, psychological, anthropological, and sociological. Recommendations for a multidimensional approach to this important clinical issue are proposed...|$|R

40|$|Background Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is {{associated}} with <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> (1). Somatic comorbidity {{has been found to}} be one of the most important predictors for <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> (2). Comorbid conditions that are associated with <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> are: cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal system disorders, genitourinary diseases, hematologic diseases, infectious diseases, and malignancies. A few studies have found comorbid depression to be associated with an increased risk for mortality (3). The combination of both somatic comorbidity and comorbid depression as a risk factor for mortality has not yet been investigated. Whether this combination is an additional risk factor for <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> is important information for clinicians to be able to adapt their screening process and when necessary their treatment. Objectives To investigate which comorbid conditions are associated with <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> and if the combination of a somatic comorbid condition and comorbid depression is more associated with <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> than one of these conditions alone. Methods Longitudinal data over a period of eleven years were collected from 882 patients with RA at study inclusion. Data by means of self-reported questionnaires were collected in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2002 and 2008. Of all of the participants included at baseline, the mortality status was obtained from the register of the Statistics Netherlands. Somatic comorbidity was measured by a questionnaire including 20 chronic diseases. Comorbid depression was measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Depression Scale. To study the relationship between comorbidity and survival among RA patients, we performed a Cox regression analysis. Results 78 % of the patients at baseline were women. The mean age was 59. 3 (SD 14. 8) years and the median disease duration was 5. 0 (IQR 2. 0 - 14. 0) years. Comorbid conditions that were associated with <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> were respiratory conditions, gastrointestinal conditions, cancer and comorbid depression. The combination of a somatic comorbid condition and comorbid depression did not lead to an additional risk for <b>premature</b> <b>mortality.</b> Conclusions Both somatic comorbidity and comorbid depression are a risk factor for <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> among patients with RA. These results emphasize the importance of paying attention to both somatic comorbidity and comorbid depression in clinical practice, and highlight the importance of ascertaining the presence of such comorbidities and to adjust treatment when necessary...|$|R

40|$|In social {{development}} and health sector, India’s performance is still lagging behind many Sub-Saharan African countries. There are also disparities between the {{urban and rural}} sectors and between privileged upper class and the socially disadvantaged groups. Widespread illiteracy, <b>avoidable</b> morbidity, <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> and deep-seated inequality of opportunity are still prevailing in India. India’s achievements in dealing with life expectancy, elementary education, nutritional well being, protection from illness, social security and consumption levels has been substantially and systematically out passed by many other developing countries. Compared to other countries, social sector expenditure is negligible in India, especially when compared it with UNDP recommended ratio. In the case of Indian state {{we can see that}} accelerated growth rate does not to have led to a corresponding change in living condition of rural poor. Here lies the importance of participatory mode of approach. The provision of social security cannot rely exclusively either on market forces or on the state initiative. There is an urgent need for participation in the distribution of social security measure. The move towards participatory growth calls for an integrated view of the process of economic expansion. The UN has defined community participation as ‘the creation of opportunity to enable all members of a community and the larger society to actively contribute to and influence the development process to share equitable the fruits of development’. This participatory mode of development views village community as the site for intervention. In this process it has to mediate through agencies working at that level. This is most commonly done through NGOs. In this broader context of Indian state’s commitment to liberalization, present paper attempts to study the participatory intervention of NGO in community health. For a detailed study, success story of AWARE - NGO working among the marginalized people in rural Andhra Pradesh is selected. The paper does not project NGO as viable alternative to fill the space vacated by state. But it only tries to establish that the objective of “Health for All” can be achieved only through community participation. The present paper is divided into 4 parts. The first part briefly outlines health sector performance and trends during the post reform era and its outcomes. The second part analyses the status of health sector in Andhra Pradesh, major indicators and initiatives. The third part in detail discusses the sustainable strategy of AWARE and its impact on health sector in rural Andhra. The final part contains major findings and concluding remarks. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{examined}} {{the association of}} mortality with selected socioeconomic indicators of inequality and segregation among blacks and whites younger than age 65 in 267 US metropolitan areas. The primary aim of the analysis was to operationalize the concept of institutional racism in public health. METHODS: Socioeconomic indicators were drawn from Census and vital statistics data for 1989 - 1991 and included median household income; two measures of income inequality; {{percentage of the population}} that was black; and a measure of residential segregation. RESULTS: Age-adjusted <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> was 81 % higher in blacks than in whites, and median household income was 40 % lower. Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, was greater within the black population (0. 45) than within the white population (0. 40; p < 0. 001). To confirm that the proxy socioeconomic variables were relevant markers of population health status, regression analysis was performed initially on data for the total population. These variables were all independently and significantly related to <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> (p < or = 0. 01; R(2) = 0. 74). Income inequality for the total population was significantly correlated with <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> (r = 0. 33). Black (r = 0. 26) and white (r = 0. 20) population-specific correlations between income inequality and <b>premature</b> <b>mortality,</b> while still significant, were smaller. Residential segregation was significantly related to <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> and income inequality for blacks (r = 0. 38 for both); among whites, however, segregation was modestly correlated with <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> (r = 0. 19) and uncorrelated with income inequality. Regional analyses demonstrated that the association of segregation with <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> was much more pronounced in the South and in areas with larger black populations. CONCLUSION: Social factors such as income inequality and segregation strongly influence <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> in the US. Ecologic studies of the relationships among social factors and population health can measure attributes of the social context that may be relevant for population health, providing the basis for imputing macro-level relationships...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> by {{county in the}} United States and assessed its association with metro/urban/rural geographic location, socioeconomic status, household type, and availability of medical care. METHODS: Age-adjusted years of potential life lost before 75 years of age were calculated and mapped by county. Predictors of <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> were determined by multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: <b>Premature</b> <b>mortality</b> was greatest in rural counties in the Southeast and Southwest. In a model predicting 55 % of variation across counties, community structure factors explained more than availability of medical care. The proportions of female-headed households and Black populations were the strongest predictors, followed by variables measuring low education, American Indian population, and chronic unemployment. Greater availability of generalist physicians predicted fewer years of life lost in metropolitan counties but more in rural counties. CONCLUSIONS: Community structure factors statistically explain much {{of the variation in}} <b>premature</b> <b>mortality.</b> The degree to which <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> is predicted by percentage of female-headed households is important for policy-making and delivery of medical care.

A 25 % reduction in <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> due four main NCDs was targeted by the 2011 High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of NCDs. While overall CVD mortality fell in the Americas during the past decade, trends in <b>premature</b> CVD <b>mortality</b> during the same period have not been described, particularly in the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. This is a population-based trend-series study based on a total of 6, 133, 666 deaths to describe the trends and characteristics of <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> due to CVD and to estimates of the average annual percentage of change during the period 2000 - 2010 in the Americas. <b>Premature</b> <b>mortality</b> due to CVD in the Americas fell by 21 % in the period 2000 - 2010 with a - 2. 5 % average annual rate of change in the last 5 year-a statistically significant reduction of mortality-. Mortality from ischemic diseases, declined by 25 % - 24 % among men and 26 % among women. Cerebrovascular diseases declined by 27 % - 26 % among men and 28 % among women.

The material for the study was the number of deaths due to main causes in Poland in years 2002 – 2011, based on data from the Central Statistical Office. <b>Premature</b> <b>mortality</b> analysis was conducted with the use of PYLL indicator (PYLL – Potential Years of Life Lost). PYLL rate was calculated according to the method proposed by J. Romeder, according to which the <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> was defined as death before the age of 70. Time trends of PYLL rate and the annual percent change (APC) were assessed using the Joinpoint Regression Programme. Rural/urban ratio was used to presented the differences in <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> between rural and urban areas. In years 2002 – 2011, the PYLL rate for all-cause deaths decreased by 13. 2 % among men and 16. 0 % among women in rural areas, whereas in urban decreased it decreased by 15. 7 % among men and 14. 9 % among women. In 2011, the main causes of PYLL among men in rural areas were: external causes (32. 3 %), cardiovascular diseases (23. 5 %) and cancers (19. 4 %); in urban areas: cardiovascular diseases (24. 7 %), external causes (24. 3 %) and cancers (20. 9 %). Among women in rural areas, the leading causes were: cancers (39. 9 %), cardiovascular diseases (20. 1 %) and external causes (15. 1 %). The main causes of <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> among women in urban areas were: cancers (41. 7 %), cardiovascular diseases (19. 6 %) and external causes (11. 1 %). <b>Premature</b> <b>mortality</b> among men in rural areas was significantly higher than in urban for all analysed causes of death, with the exception of ischaemic heart diseases and colorectal cancer. <b>Premature</b> <b>mortality</b> among women in rural areas was significantly lower than in urban for all analysed cause of deaths, except of cerebrovascular diseases, external causes, suicides and traffic accidents.

MethodsCounty-level data on 3, 139 US counties from the 2010 County Health Rankings were linked to county mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Compressed Mortality database. We divided counties into 3 groups, defined by sample median household income levels: low-income (22 ̆ 030425 th percentile, 29, 631), mid-income (25 th- 75 th percentile, 29, 631 - 39, 401), and high-income (22 ̆ 030575 th percentile, 22 ̆ 030539, 401). We analyzed group differences in geographic, sociodemographic, racial/ethnic, health care, social, and behavioral factors. Stratified multivariable linear regression explored the associations of these health determinants with <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> for high- and low-income groups. ResultsThe association between income and <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> was stronger among low-income counties than high-income counties. We found differences {{in the pattern of}} risk factors between high- and low-income groups. Significant geographic, sociodemographic, racial/ethnic, health care, social, and behavioral disparities exist among income groups. ConclusionGeographic location and the percentages of adult smokers and adults with a college education were associated with <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> rates in US counties. These relationships varied in magnitude and significance across income groups. Our findings suggest that population health policies aimed at reducing mortality disparities require an understanding of the socioeconomic context within which modifiable variables exist...|$|R
30|$|To do this, I will {{estimate}} {{the decline in}} the <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> rate attributable to pharmaceutical innovation. The <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> rate is the number of potential years of life lost (PYLL) per 100, 000 population (OECD 2017 a, b). PYLL is a summary measure of <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> that provides an explicit way of weighting deaths occurring at younger ages. The calculation of PYLL involves summing up deaths occurring at each age and multiplying this with the number of remaining years to live up to a selected age limit. 11 The limit of 70  years was chosen for the calculations in OECD Health Statistics. To assure cross-country and trend comparison, the PYLL are standardized, for each country and each year. The total OECD population in 2010 is taken as the reference population for age standardization.|$|R

40|$|The {{identification}} and documentation of health disparities are important functions {{of public health}} surveillance. These disparities, typically falling along lines defined by gender, race/ethnicity, and social class, are often made visible in urban settings as geographic disparities in health between neighborhoods. Recognizing that <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> is a powerful indicator of disparities in both health status and {{access to health care}} that can readily be monitored using routinely available public health surveillance data, we undertook a systematic analysis of spatial variation in <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> in Boston (1999 – 2001) across neighborhoods and sub-neighborhoods in relation to census tract (CT) poverty. Using a multilevel model based framework, we estimated that the incidence of <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> was 1. 39 times higher (95 % credible interval 1. 09 – 1. 78) among persons living in the most economically deprived CTs (≥ 20 % below poverty) compared to those in the least impoverished tracts (< 5 % below poverty). We present maps of model-based standardized mortality ratios that show substantial within-neighborhood variation in <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> and a sizeable decrease in spatial variation after adjustment for CT poverty. Additionally, we present maps of model-based direct standardized rates that can more readily be compared to externally published rates and targets, as well as maps of the population attributable fraction that show that in some of Boston’s poorest neighborhoods, the proportion of excess deaths associated with CT poverty reaches 25 – 30 %. We recommend that these methods be incorporated into routine analyses of public health surveillance data to highlight continuing social disparities in <b>premature</b> <b>mortality...</b>|$|R
40|$|Research into {{understanding}} {{the relationship between}} access to housing, health and wellbeing in cities has yielded mixed evidence to date and has been limited to case studies from Western countries. Many studies appear to highlight {{the negative effects of}} public housing in influencing the health of its residents. Current trends in the urban housing markets in cities of advanced Asian economies and debates surrounding the role of government in providing housing underscore the need for more focused research into housing and health. In this paper, we investigate Hong Kong {{as an example of a}} thriving Asian city by exploring and comparing the intra-urban geographies of <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> and public housing provision in the city. Using a fully Bayesian spatial structural model, we estimate associations between public housing provision and different types of <b>premature</b> <b>mortality.</b> We find significant geographic variations in <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> within Hong Kong during the five-year period 2005 – 2009, with positive associations between the residents of public housing and <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> risk. But the associations attenuate or are even reversed for <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> of injuries and non-communicable diseases after controlling for local deprivation, housing instability, access to local amenities and other neighbourhood characteristics. The results indicate that public housing may have a protective effect on community health, which contradicts the findings of similar studies carried out in Western cities. We suggest reasons why the association between public housing and health differs in Hong Kong and discuss the implications for housing policy in Hong Kong and other Asian cities...|$|R
40|$|This trends {{ecological}} study analyzes, across 17 autonomous communities of Spain from 1989 to 1998, {{the relationship between}} mortality (total and by main causes of death) and power relations (type of government: social democratic (SDP), conservative (CDP), and others), labor market variables, welfare state variables, income inequality, absolute income, poverty, and number of civil associations. The authors conducted a descriptive analysis; a bivariate analysis (Pearson correlation coefficients) between mortality {{and each of the}} independent variables; and a multivariate analysis, adjusting multilevel linear regression models. All dimensions of the conceptual power relations model were related to <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> in the direction hypothesized. The cross-pooled multilevel regression models show that total <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> in males, male and female cerebrovascular mortality, male and female cirrhosis mortality, and male lung cancer mortality decreased somewhat more in communities where primary health care reform was implemented more quickly. <b>Premature</b> <b>mortality</b> decreased somewhat more in SDP than in CDP communities for male and female total <b>premature</b> <b>mortality,</b> cerebrovascular mortality, and cirrhosis mortality, and male lung cancer mortality. These results are in accord with earlier studies that found a relationship among health indicators and variables related to labor market, welfare state, income inequalities, civil associations, and power relations...|$|R
40|$|Measurement of <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> is {{necessary}} to plan medical programs and to conduct effective medical activities. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the years of potential life lost (YPLL) with other mortality indices and to understand the usefulness and limitations of quantitative measurement for <b>premature</b> <b>mortality.</b> Data concerning death during employment were surveyed from 1979 to 1984. One thousand seven hundred twenty-five deaths were observed in 1, 504, 462 person-years in the study population. Proportionate mortality ratios indicated medical problems concerning malignant neoplasms and heart disease, but they could not identify the problems of suicide and traffic accidents occurring in the relatively younger group. YPLL by a constant end point at 60 years of age could rank these causes next below the major leading causes of death. Thus, YPLL might be a useful indicator of the problems concerning <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> in occupational medicine...|$|R

Abstract Background: This paper initially describes <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> by Aboriginality in South Australia during 1999 to 2006. It then examines how these outcomes vary across area level socio-economic disadvantage and geographic remoteness. Methods: The retrospective, cross-sectional analysis uses estimated resident population by sex, age and small areas based on the 2006 Census, and Unit Record <b>mortality</b> data. <b>Premature</b> <b>mortality</b> outcomes are measured using years of life lost (YLL). Subsequent intrastate comparisons are based on indirect sex and age adjusted YLL results. A multivariate model uses area level socio-economic disadvantage rank, geographic remoteness, and an interaction between the two variables to predict <b>premature</b> <b>mortality</b> outcomes.
