5|$|Because of {{widespread}} property damage and extensive death tolls the name Isabel was retired after the 2003 season, {{and will not}} be used for future Atlantic hurricanes. It was replaced by Ida for the naming list for the 2009 season. The names Ina and Ivy were <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> as possible replacement names.|$|E
5|$|Geologist Barbara J. Sivertsen {{seeks to}} {{establish}} {{a link between the}} eruption of Santorini (c. 1600 BCE) and the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt in the Bible, which was <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> in the books: The Exodus Enigma, by lan Wilson (1985) and Return to Sodom and Gomorrah, by Charles Pellegrino (1994).|$|E
5|$|One {{theory about}} the origin of the Debian logo is that Buzz Lightyear, the chosen {{character}} for the first named Debian release, has a swirl in his chin. Stefano Zacchiroli <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> that this swirl is the Debian one.|$|E

5|$|The name Lili was {{retired in}} the spring of 2003 because of its {{destruction}} and deadly Caribbean track, and will never be used again in the Atlantic basin. It was replaced with Laura for the 2008 season. The names Lucy and Lisette were <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> as possible replacement names for Lili.|$|E
5|$|While {{the long}} neck has {{traditionally}} been interpreted as a feeding adaptation, it was <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> that the oversized neck of Diplodocus and its relatives may have been primarily a sexual display, with any other feeding benefits coming second. A 2011 study refuted this idea in detail.|$|E
5|$|A 2011 genetic {{study showed}} that two {{examined}} specimens of the Columbian mammoth were grouped within a subclade of woolly mammoths. This suggests that the two populations interbred and produced fertile offspring. A North American type formerly referred to as M. jeffersonii may be a hybrid between the two species. A 2015 study suggested that the animals in the range where M. columbi and M. primigenius overlapped formed a metapopulation of hybrids with varying morphology. It <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> that Eurasian M. primigenius had a similar relationship with M. trogontherii, in areas where their range overlapped.|$|E

50|$|The title {{refers to}} the writers' {{interest}} in the ATV series The Prisoner, and whilst it <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> that (like that TV series) the main theme of the Kaldor City series may be the nature of reality and fiction, it <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> (again, like the TV series) that definite answers may not be forthcoming.|$|R

5|$|Alternative {{sites were}} {{considered}} as temporary holding locations during renovations. In 2005, officials investigated establishing a new temporary site be created {{at the old}} Lake Success location. Brooklyn was <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> as a temporary site. Another alternative for a temporary headquarters or a new permanent facility was the World Trade Center site. Once again, these plans met resistance both within the UN and from the United States and New York governments and were abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{regards the}} main influences {{at play in}} the Georgian alphabet, as scholars have debated whether it was inspired more by the Greek alphabet, or by Semitic alphabets such as Aramaic. Recent historiography focuses on greater similarities with the Greek alphabet than in the other Caucasian writing systems, most notably the order and numeric value of letters. Some scholars have <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> certain pre-Christian Georgian cultural symbols or clan markers as a possible inspiration for particular letters.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{having a}} main {{military}} goal of deterrence, strategists envisioned the Swiss nuclear strike capability {{as part of}} a preemptive war against the Soviets. The Swiss Air Force Mirage III jet {{would have been able to}} carry nuclear bombs as far as Moscow. They <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> the weapons could be used on Swiss soil against a possible invading force.|$|E

5|$|Disruptions in the plantar fascia's normal {{mechanical}} movement during standing and walking (known as the Windlass mechanism) {{are thought to}} {{contribute to the development of}} plantar fasciitis by placing excess strain on the calcaneal tuberosity. Other studies have <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> that plantar fasciitis is not actually due to inflamed plantar fascia, but may be a tendon injury involving the flexor digitorum brevis muscle located immediately deep to the plantar fascia.|$|E
5|$|Fields opposed a plan {{to develop}} {{hydroelectric}} power generation capabilities on the Cumberland Falls. In order to prevent development, he accepted an offer from T. Coleman du Pont to purchase the property around the falls and donate it to the state. He <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> the creation of Carter Caves State Resort Park in his home county.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Kirby <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that there}} was much scope for {{expanding}} {{the reach of the}} limitations on legislative and executive power imposed by Chapter III, and drawing on another paper by McHugh, argued that this ought to extend to the protection of due process rights as implicit constitutional rights, {{in the absence of an}} explicit bill of rights.|$|E
25|$|Volaticotherium, {{from the}} {{boundary}} the early Cretaceous about 125M years ago, is the earliest-known gliding mammal {{and had a}} gliding membrane that stretched out between its limbs, rather {{like that of a}} modern flying squirrel. This <b>also</b> <b>suggests</b> it was active mainly during the day. The closely related Argentoconodon also shows similar adaptations that may <b>also</b> <b>suggest</b> aerial locomotion.|$|R

5|$|In 2005, Rovers ran an April Fools' joke {{on their}} {{official}} website, {{stating that the}} team's new away strip would be all pink. Although this {{was intended to be}} a joke, a number of fans petitioned the club to get the kit made for real, and <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> that funds raised through the sale of the pink shirts should be donated to a breast cancer charity. Although the pink shirts were never used in a competitive fixture, they were worn for a pre-season friendly against Plymouth Argyle in 2006.|$|E
5|$|It was <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} Kir'Shara itself was similar in context to the Nag Hammadi library, {{which was a}} {{collection}} of thirteen codices found in Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945 that date back to between the 2nd to 5th centuries. Unlike those codices, the Vulcan High Council attempts to suppress the revelation of the Kir'Shara {{in a similar manner}} to the Catholic Church's suppression seen in other fictional works such as Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code or James Redfield's The Celestine Prophecy.|$|E
5|$|It {{was found}} that the {{radiation}} caused the tumour to shrink. Independently, Alexander Graham Bell <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> the use of radiation in this way. In the early twentieth century, techniques for the application of brachytherapy were pioneered at the Curie institute in Paris by Danlos and at St Luke's and Memorial Hospital in New York by Robert Abbe.|$|E

5|$|Periyar {{hailed the}} Thirukkural as a {{valuable}} scripture which contained many scientific and philosophical truths. He also praised the secular nature of the work. Periyar praised Thiruvalluvar for his description of God as a formless entity with only positive attributes. He <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> that one who reads the Thirukkural will become a Self-respecter, absorbing knowledge in politics, society, and economics. According to him, though certain items in this ancient book of ethics may not relate to today, it permitted such changes for modern society.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund III's confessor {{and court}} priest, who were Jesuits, {{supported}} Radziwiłł against Andrew. Thereafter, Andrew urged the Holy See to send Franciscan friars to Transylvania {{instead of the}} Jesuits (who were supported by Sigismund Báthory). He <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> that the pope should make a Franciscan friar bishop of Transylvania, with a see in Csíksomlyó (now Șumuleu Ciuc in Romania). He settled Catholic priests in four villages on his estates. The Holy See authorized him to set up deaneries in Transylvania, making him the actual head of the Catholic Church in the principality.|$|E
5|$|Techniques {{based on}} DNA {{comparison}} suggest Aloe vera is relatively {{closely related to}} Aloe perryi, a species endemic to Yemen. Similar techniques, using chloroplast DNA sequence comparison and ISSR profiling have <b>also</b> <b>suggested</b> it {{is closely related to}} Aloe forbesii, Aloe inermis, Aloe scobinifolia, Aloe sinkatana, and Aloe striata. With the exception of the South African species A. striata, these Aloe species are native to Socotra (Yemen), Somalia, and Sudan. The lack of obvious natural populations of the species has led some authors to suggest Aloe vera may be of hybrid origin.|$|E
