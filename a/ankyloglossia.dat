50|$|Messner et al. studied <b>ankyloglossia</b> {{and infant}} feeding. Thirty-six infants with <b>ankyloglossia</b> were {{compared}} to a control group without <b>ankyloglossia.</b> The two groups were followed for six months to assess possible breastfeeding difficulties; defined as nipple pain lasting more than six weeks, or infant difficulty latching onto or staying onto the mother’s breast. Twenty-five percent of mothers of infants with <b>ankyloglossia</b> reported breastfeeding difficulty compared with only 3% of the mothers in the control group. The study concluded that <b>ankyloglossia</b> can adversely affect breastfeeding in certain infants. Infants with ankyologlossia do not, however, have such big difficulties when feeding from a bottle. Limitations of this study include {{the small sample size}} {{and the fact that the}} quality of the mother’s breastfeeding was not assessed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ankyloglossia,</b> {{also known}} as tongue-tie, is a {{congenital}} oral anomaly that may decrease mobility of the tongue tip and is caused by an unusually short, thick lingual frenulum, a membrane connecting {{the underside of the}} tongue {{to the floor of the}} mouth. <b>Ankyloglossia</b> varies in degree of severity from mild cases characterized by mucous membrane bands to complete <b>ankyloglossia</b> whereby the tongue is tethered to the floor of the mouth.|$|E
50|$|Messner and Lalakea studied {{speech in}} {{children}} with <b>ankyloglossia.</b> They noted that the phonemes likely to be affected due to <b>ankyloglossia</b> include sibilants and lingual sounds such as 'r'. In addition, the authors also state that it is uncertain as to which patients will have a speech disorder that {{can be linked to}} <b>ankyloglossia</b> and {{that there is no way}} to predict at a young age which patients will need treatment. The authors studied 30 children from one to 12 years of age with <b>ankyloglossia,</b> all of whom underwent frenuloplasty. Fifteen children underwent speech evaluation before and after surgery. Eleven patients were found to have abnormal articulation before surgery and nine of these patients were found to have improved articulation after surgery. Based on the findings, the authors concluded that it is possible for children with <b>ankyloglossia</b> to have normal speech in spite of decreased tongue mobility. However, according to their study, a large percentage of children with <b>ankyloglossia</b> will have articulation deficits that can be linked to tongue-tie and these deficits may be improved with surgery. The authors also note that <b>ankyloglossia</b> does not cause a delay in speech or language, but at the most, problems with enunciation. Limitations of the study include a small sample size as well as a lack of blinding of the speech-language pathologists who evaluated the subjects’ speech.|$|E
50|$|Opinion varies {{regarding}} how frequently <b>ankyloglossia</b> truly causes problems. Some professionals {{believe it is}} rarely symptomatic, whereas others believe it {{is associated with a}} variety of problems. The disagreement among professionals was documented in a study by Messner and Lalakea (2000). The authors sent a survey to a total of 1598 otolaryngologists, pediatricians, speech-language pathologists and lactation consultants with questions to ascertain their beliefs on <b>ankyloglossia.</b> 797 of the surveys were fully completed and used in the study. It was found that 69% of lactation consultants, but only a minority of pediatricians answered that <b>ankyloglossia</b> is frequently associated with feeding difficulties; 60% of otolaryngologists and 50% of speech pathologists answered that <b>ankyloglossia</b> is sometimes associated with speech difficulties compared to only 23% of pediatricians; 67% of otolaryngologists compared with 21% of pediatricians answered that <b>ankyloglossia</b> is sometimes associated with social and mechanical difficulties. Limitations of this study include a reduced sample size due to unreturned or incomplete surveys.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ankyloglossia</b> {{can result}} in {{mechanical}} and social effects. Lalakea and Messner studied 15 people, aged 14 to 68 years old. The subjects were given questionnaires {{in order to assess}} functional complaints associated with <b>ankyloglossia.</b> Eight subjects noted one or more mechanical limitations which included cuts or discomfort underneath the tongue and difficulties with kissing, licking one’s lips, eating an ice cream cone, keeping one’s tongue clean and performing tongue tricks. In addition, seven subjects noted social effects such as embarrassment and teasing. The authors concluded that this study confirmed anecdotal evidence of mechanical problems associated with <b>ankyloglossia</b> and it suggests that the kinds of mechanical and social problems noted may be more prevalent than previously thought. Furthermore, the authors note that some patients may be unaware of the extent of the limitations they have due to <b>ankyloglossia,</b> since they have never experienced normal tongue range. A limitation of this study is the small sample size that also represented a large age range.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ankyloglossia</b> {{can affect}} eating, speech, and oral hygiene {{as well as}} have mechanical/social effects. <b>Ankyloglossia</b> can also prevent the tongue from {{contacting}} the anterior palate. This can then promote an infantile swallow and hamper the progression to an adult-like swallow which can result in an open bite deformity. It can also result in mandibular prognathism; this happens when the tongue contacts the anterior portion of the mandible with exaggerated anterior thrusts.|$|E

50|$|A {{severity}} {{scale for}} <b>ankyloglossia,</b> which grades the appearance {{and function of}} the tongue, is recommended {{for use in the}} Academy of Breastfeeding medicine.|$|E
50|$|Wallace and Clark {{also studied}} {{breastfeeding}} difficulties in infants with <b>ankyloglossia.</b> They followed 10 infants with <b>ankyloglossia</b> who underwent surgical tongue tie division. Eight {{of the ten}} mothers experienced poor infant latching onto the breast, 6/10 experienced sore nipples and 5/10 experienced continual feeding cycles; 3/10 mothers were exclusively breastfeeding. Following a tongue-tie division, 4/10 mothers noted immediate improvements in breastfeeding, 3/10 mothers did not notice any improvements and 6/10 mothers continued breastfeeding {{for at least four}} months after the surgery. The study concluded that tongue-tie division may be a possible benefit for infants experiencing breastfeeding difficulties due to <b>ankyloglossia</b> and further investigation is warranted. The limitations of this study include the small sample size and {{the fact that there was}} not a control group. In addition, the conclusions were based on subjective parent report as opposed to objective measures.|$|E
5000|$|Intervention for <b>ankyloglossia</b> does {{sometimes}} include {{surgery in}} the form of frenotomy (also called a frenectomy or frenulectomy) or frenuloplasty. This relatively common dental procedure may be done with soft-tissue lasers, such as the CO2 laser. However, authors such as Horton et al. [...] are in opposition to it. According to Lalakea and Messner, surgery can be considered for patients of any age with a tight frenulum, as well as a history of speech, feeding, or mechanical/social difficulties. Adults with <b>ankyloglossia</b> may elect the procedure. Some of those who have done so report post-operative pain.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ankyloglossia</b> (tongue tie) - {{where the}} lingual frenum tethers the tongue {{to the floor}} of the mouth. If it interferes with oral hygiene and feeding, frenectomy may be indicated.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in TBX22 cause X-linked {{cleft palate}} and <b>ankyloglossia.</b> CPX has been {{described}} in {{a small number of}} families exhibiting a strong X linked Mendelian inheritance. The cleft phenotype predominantly affects males who show variation ranging from a complete cleft of the secondary palate, submucous cleft, or bifid uvula to high arched palate. <b>Ankyloglossia</b> is frequently seen in affected patients and carrier females, and {{has proved to be a}} useful indicator of CPX. Temporal and spatial studies using in situ hybridization in both human and mouse has shown that TBX22/Tbx22 is expressed primarily in the palatal shelves and tongue during palatogenesis, indicating a specific role of TBX22 in both palatal and tongue development. In addition to families with well defined X linked inheritance, TBX22 mutations have been identified in several families where pedigree size and/or family history were too limited to predict mode of inheritance. In these cases, ascertainment was largely based on the presence of <b>ankyloglossia</b> as well as cleft palate.|$|E
5000|$|There are varying {{types of}} {{intervention}} for <b>ankyloglossia.</b> Horton et al., have a classical belief that people with <b>ankyloglossia</b> can compensate in their speech for limited tongue range of motion. For example, if {{the tip of the}} tongue is restricted for making sounds such as /n, t, d, l/, the tongue can compensate through dentalization; this is when the tongue tip moves forward and up. When producing /r/, elevation of the mandible can compensate for restriction of tongue movement. Also, compensations can be made for /s/ and /z/ by using the dorsum of the tongue for contact against the palatal rugae. Thus, Horton et al. proposed compensatory strategies as a way to counteract the adverse effects of <b>ankyloglossia</b> and did not promote surgery. Non-surgical treatments for ankyglossia are typically performed by Orofacial Myology specialists, and involve using exercises to strengthen and improve the function of the facial muscles and thus promote proper function of the face, mouth and tongue ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Ankyloglossia,</b> {{also known}} as tongue-tie, is a {{congenital}} anomaly characterised by an abnormally short lingual frenulum; when severe, {{the tip of the}} tongue cannot be protruded beyond the lower incisor teeth.|$|E
50|$|A {{congenital}} {{disorder of}} the tongue is that of <b>ankyloglossia</b> also known as tongue-tie. The tongue {{is tied to the}} floor of the mouth by a very short and thickened frenulum and this affects speech, eating, and swallowing.|$|E
5000|$|A viable {{alternative}} to surgery for children with <b>ankyloglossia</b> {{is to take a}} wait-and-see approach. Ruffoli et al. report that the frenulum naturally recedes during the process of a child's growth between six months and six years of age; ...|$|E
50|$|Horton {{and colleagues}} {{discussed}} {{the relationship between}} <b>ankyloglossia</b> and speech. They believe that the tongue-tie contributes to difficulty in range and rate of articulation and that compensation is needed. Compensation at its worst may involve a Cupid's bow of the tongue.|$|E
50|$|Messner and Lalakea also {{examined}} speech and <b>ankyloglossia</b> in another study. They studied 15 patients and speech was grossly normal {{in all the}} subjects. However, half of the subjects reported that they thought that their speech was more effortful than other peoples' speech.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that TBX22 makes {{a significant contribution to}} the prevalence of cleft palate at least in the Brazilian and the North American cohorts. To date, 10 different TBX22 mutations have been reported in patients with CP and/or <b>ankyloglossia.</b> These include small deletions/insertions, nonsense, splice site, frameshift and missense alterations.|$|E
5000|$|A tight {{frenulum}} in {{this context}} is sometimes referred to as [...] "tongue-tie" [...] which is also known as <b>ankyloglossia.</b> In this condition the frenulum of the tongue restricts range of motion which may interfere with breastfeeding or speech. A less extensive clipping of the lingual frenulum is known as a frenotomy.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{method for}} producing a flutter tongue {{effect is to}} roll {{the tip of the}} tongue as rapidly as possible. This is done by performing an isolated alveolar trill while playing the notes desired. Some players find it difficult or even impossible to roll their tongues in this way, possibly due to <b>ankyloglossia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Lalakea and Messner {{note that}} {{mechanical}} and social effects may occur even without other {{problems related to}} <b>ankyloglossia,</b> such as speech and feeding difficulties. Also, mechanical and social effects may not arise until later in childhood, as younger children {{may be unable to}} recognize or report the effects. In addition, some problems, such as kissing, may not come about until later in life.|$|E
50|$|There are {{pertinent}} symptomatic {{questions that}} {{can be considered for}} the diagnosis of tongue thrust swallow. Some of these questions are geared toward tongue protrusion and an opening of lips when the client is in repose; habitual mouth breathing; digit sucking; existence of high and narrow palatal arch; <b>ankyloglossia</b> (tongue-tie); malocclusions, (Class II, III); weak chewing muscles (masseter); weak lip muscles (orbicularis oris); overdeveloped chin muscles (mentalis); muscular imbalance; abnormal dentition.|$|E

50|$|According to Horton et al., {{diagnosis}} of <b>ankyloglossia</b> may be difficult; {{it is not}} always apparent by looking at the underside of the tongue, but is often dependent on the range of movement permitted by the genioglossus muscles. For infants, passively elevating the tongue tip with a tongue depressor may reveal the problem. For older children, making the tongue move to its maximum range will demonstrate the tongue tip restriction. In addition, palpation of genioglossus {{on the underside of the}} tongue will aid in confirming the diagnosis.|$|E
5000|$|Factors {{that can}} {{contribute}} to tongue thrusting include macroglossia (enlarged tongue), thumb sucking, large tonsils, hereditary factors, <b>ankyloglossia</b> (tongue tie), and certain types of artificial nipples used in feeding infants, also allergies or nasal congestion can cause the tongue to lie low in the mouth because of breathing obstruction and finally contributing to tongue thrusting. In addition, it is also seen after prolonged therapy by levodopa in Parkinsonism, also it occurs as extra pyramidal side effect (Acute muscular dystonia) after use of Neuroleptics (Anti-Psychotics).|$|E
50|$|TBX22 is {{a member}} of a phylogenetically conserved family of {{proteins}} that share a common DNA-binding domain, the T-box. T-box genes encode transcription factors involved in the regulation of developmental processes. Mutations in this gene have been associated with the inherited X-linked disorder, cleft palate with <b>ankyloglossia</b> (tongue-tie), and it is believed {{to play a major role}} in human palatogenesis. It has previously been mapped to the long arm of the X chromosome and it has now been demonstrated that mutations in the gene TBX22 are the cause of this syndrome. TBX22 mutations also result in non-syndromic cleft palate in some populations.|$|E
5000|$|Van der Woude {{syndrome}} (VDWS) is {{a genetic}} disorder {{characterized by the}} combination of lower lip pits, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, and cleft palate alone (CP). The frequency of orofacial clefts ranges from 1:1000 to 1:500 births worldwide, {{and there are more}} than 400 syndromes that involve cleft lip with or without cleft palate. [...] VWS is distinct from other clefting syndromes due to the combination of cleft lip and palate (CLP) and CP within the same family. Other features frequently associated with VWS include hypodontia in 10-81% of cases, narrow arched palate, congenital heart disease, heart murmur and cerebral abnormalities, syndactyly of the hands, polythelia, <b>ankyloglossia,</b> and adhesions between the upper and lower gum pads.|$|E
5000|$|Successful {{treatments}} {{have shown}} that causes are functional rather than physical: that is, most lisps are caused by errors in tongue placement within the mouth rather than caused by any injury or congenital deformity to the mouth. The most frequently discussed of these problems is tongue thrust in which the tongue protrudes beyond the front teeth. This protrusion affects speech as well as swallowing {{and can lead to}} lisping. <b>Ankyloglossia</b> or tongue-tie can also be responsible for lisps in children. However it is unclear whether these deficiencies are caused by the tongue-tie itself or the muscle weakness following the correction of the tongue-tie. [...] Overbites and underbites may also contribute to non-lingual lisping. Temporary lisps can be caused by dental work, dental appliances such as dentures or retainers or by swollen or bruised tongues.|$|E
5000|$|The tongue {{starts to}} develop at about 4 weeks. The tongue {{originates}} from the first, second, and third pharyngeal arches which induces {{the migration of}} muscles from the occipital myotomes. A U-shaped sulcus develops in front of and {{on both sides of}} the oral part of the tongue. This allows the tongue to be free and highly mobile, except at the region of the lingual frenulum, where it remains attached. Disturbances during this stage cause tongue tie or <b>ankyloglossia.</b> During the sixth week of gestation, the medial nasal processes approach each other to form a single globular process that in time gives rise to the nasal tip, columella, prolabium, frenulum of the upper lip, and the primary palate. [...] As the tongue continues to develop, frenulum cells undergo apoptosis, retracting away from the tip of the tongue, and increasing the tongue's mobility.|$|E
50|$|LGR5 is {{a member}} of the Wnt {{signaling}} pathway. Although its ligand remains elusive, it has been shown that costimulation with R-spondin 1 and Wnt-3a induce increased internalization of LGR5. LGR5 also cointernalizes with LRP6 and FZD5 via a clathrin-dependent pathway to form a ternary complex upon Wnt ligand binding. Moreover, the rapid cointernalization of LRP6 by LGR5 induces faster rates of degradation for the former. It has been shown that the C-terminal region of LGR5 is crucial for both dynamic internalization and degradation to occur, although C-terminal truncation does not inhibit LRP6 interaction and internalization, but rather, heightens receptor activity. Thus, only the initial interaction with its unknown ligand and other membrane bound receptors is crucial in its role in Wnt signalling and not the internalization itself. LGR5 is crucial during embryogenesis as LGR null studies in mice incurred 100% neonatal mortality accompanied by several craniofacial distortions such as <b>ankyloglossia</b> and gastrointestinal dilation.|$|E
