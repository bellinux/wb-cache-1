5|$|Another World was {{innovative}} {{in its use}} of cinematic {{effects in}} both real-time and cutscenes, which earned the game praise amongst critics and commercial success. It also influenced {{a number of other}} video games and designers, inspiring such titles as Flashback, Ico, Metal Gear Solid, <b>and</b> <b>Silent</b> Hill.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} widely read {{political}} novel in the United States, Uncle Tom's Cabin greatly influenced development {{of not only}} American literature but also protest literature in general. Later books which owe a large debt to Uncle Tom's Cabin include The Jungle by Upton Sinclair <b>and</b> <b>Silent</b> Spring by Rachel Carson.|$|E
5|$|This {{nocturnal bird}} of prey hunts mainly rodents, usually by {{dropping}} from a perch to seize its prey, which it swallows whole; in more urban areas its diet includes {{a higher proportion of}} birds. Vision and hearing adaptations <b>and</b> <b>silent</b> flight aid its night hunting. The tawny owl is capable of catching smaller owls, but is itself vulnerable to the eagle owl or northern goshawk.|$|E

5|$|Cumberbatch's early {{television}} roles {{include two}} separate guest roles in Heartbeat (2000, 2004), Freddy in Tipping the Velvet (2002), Edward Hand in Cambridge Spies (2003) and Rory in the ITV comedy drama series Fortysomething (2003). He also featured in Spooks <b>and</b> <b>Silent</b> Witness. In 2004, he landed his first main part in television as Stephen Hawking in Hawking. He {{was nominated for}} the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actor and won the Golden Nymph for Television Films– Best Performance by an Actor. He later provided Hawking's voice in the first episode of the television series Curiosity. He also appeared in the BBC miniseries Dunkirk as Lieutenant Jimmy Langley.|$|E
5|$|Film {{director}} Kevin Smith {{and actor}} Jason Mewes {{returned to the}} show for two episodes when they guest starred as exaggerated versions of themselves (for example Kevin is portrayed as being unmarried and childless). The episodes depict the premiere of Jay <b>and</b> <b>Silent</b> Bob Go Canadian, Eh!, a fictional feature film in the View Askewniverse series that used Degrassi Community School as a filming location during season four. The scenes Alanis Morissette had filmed in season four to play the film's school principal were replayed {{as part of the}} film at the premiere.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{generally}} resident across its range, but sightings of solitary <b>and</b> <b>silent</b> birds {{have suggested that}} the species may be migratory in Bolivia and Brazil. A study published in 2005 suggested it was migratory in Santa Fe, Argentina, as the species was not observed in the area between March and September (the austral winter). In 2006 the species was reported {{for the first time in}} Peru, but it was unclear if this represented a vagrant escaping cold weather or a migrant, as the species is mostly uncommon across its range and that area is poorly studied ornithologically.|$|E

5|$|The {{unsuccessful}} Headless Cross US tour {{began in}} May 1989 with openers Kingdom Come <b>and</b> <b>Silent</b> Rage, {{but because of}} poor ticket sales, the tour was cancelled after just eight shows. The European leg of the tour began in September, where the band were enjoying chart success. After a string of Japanese shows the band embarked on a 23 date Russian tour with Girlschool. Black Sabbath {{was one of the}} first bands to tour Russia, after Mikhail Gorbachev opened the country to western acts for the first time in 1989.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, Damon and Affleck wrote Good Will Hunting (1997), a {{screenplay}} {{about a young}} math genius, an extension of a screenplay he wrote for an assignment at Harvard, having integrated advice from director Rob Reiner, screenwriter William Goldman, and writer/director Kevin Smith. It received nine Academy Awards nominations, earning Damon and Affleck Oscars and Golden Globes for Best Screenplay. Damon was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for the same film, which netted an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for co-star Robin Williams. He and Affleck were each paid salaries of $600,000, while the film grossed over $225million at the worldwide box office. The two later parodied their roles from the film in Kevin Smith's 2001 movie Jay <b>and</b> <b>Silent</b> Bob Strike Back.|$|E
5|$|On Enterprise, T'Pol teaches some of {{the colonists}} how to evade edged-weapon attacks (from Vulcan martial-art 'Suus-mahna'), while Ensign Hoshi Sato (Linda Park) and Lieutenant Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating) teach other colonists how to fire their weapons more accurately. Archer and Tucker then suggest the colonists shift the entire colony to the south 50 meters. When the Klingon marauders arrive, the colony appears deserted <b>and</b> <b>silent.</b> Finally the {{defenders}} show themselves, and in the ensuing fight the Klingons are lured into an area surrounded by the capped-off deuterium well heads. On cue, the wells are ignited, surrounding the Klingons with flames. Tessic then tells the Klingons to leave and never come back. After they depart, Archer is rewarded with 2,000 liters of deuterium by the grateful miners.|$|E

5|$|Overall, data on {{the social}} {{behaviour}} of the grey currawong is lacking, and roosting habits are unknown. It is generally shyer and more wary than its pied relative, but has become more accustomed to people in areas of high human activity in southwest Western Australia. Its undulating flight is rapid <b>and</b> <b>silent.</b> It hops or runs when on the ground. Birds are generally encountered singly or in pairs, but may forage in groups of three to eleven birds. Up to forty birds may gather to harvest a fruit tree if one is found. The black-winged subspecies is seldom seen in groups larger than four or five, while the clinking currawong may form groups of up to forty birds over the non-breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Seattle {{was also}} the home base of {{impresario}} Alexander Pantages who, starting in 1902, opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting vaudeville acts <b>and</b> <b>silent</b> movies. His activities soon expanded, and the thrifty Greek went on {{and became one of}} America's greatest theater and movie tycoons. Between Pantages and his rival John Considine, Seattle was for a while the western United States' vaudeville mecca. B. Marcus Priteca, the Scottish-born and Seattle-based architect, built several theaters for Pantages, including some in Seattle. The theaters he built for Pantages in Seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses, but many other theaters survive in other cities of the U.S., often retaining the Pantages name; Seattle's surviving Paramount Theatre, on which he collaborated, was not a Pantages theater.|$|E
5|$|Movie {{director}} Kevin Smith {{has been}} a fan of the Degrassi series from the early 1990s, when he worked at a convenience store in Leonardo, New Jersey. Actor Jason Mewes was his co-worker at the store and also became a fan. Every Sunday morning at work, Smith and Mewes watched episodes of Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High on Public Broadcasting Service. Smith enjoyed the earlier series and has acknowledged an infatuation with Stacie Mistysyn. He has also paid homage to Degrassi by referring to it in several of his films. He named a Clerks character Caitlin Bree after Mistysin's Degrassi character, Caitlin Ryan, wrote Shannen Doherty's character Rene wearing a Degrassi jacket throughout his Mallrats film, and had Jason Lee's character in Chasing Amy specifically mention Degrassi Junior High as a TV show he wants to watch, rather than going out. Smith and Mewes guest starred as themselves in the final three episodes of the fourth season. The plot for these episodes involves the pair working on Jay <b>and</b> <b>Silent</b> Bob Go Canadian, Eh!, a fictional feature film in the View Askewniverse, using Degrassi Community School as a filming location.|$|E

25|$|Although not direct sequels {{in terms}} of {{addressing}} the original film's storyline, characters from the original Clerks - primarily Jay <b>and</b> <b>Silent</b> Bob - appeared in the films Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997), Dogma (1999), and Jay <b>and</b> <b>Silent</b> Bob Strike Back (2001), all of which {{take place in the}} same continuity as Clerks. Dante and Randal also reprised their roles in Jay <b>and</b> <b>Silent</b> Bob Strike Back. The 2001 film was originally promoted as the finale to the series, but an official sequel to Clerks was announced a few years later.|$|E
