When Bond learns Sanchez has escaped, he returns to Leiter's house to find Leiter has been maimed and that Della has been murdered—and by {{implication}} raped. Bond, with Leiter's friend Sharkey, start their own investigation. They discover a marine research centre run by Krest, where Sanchez has hidden cocaine and a submarine for smuggling.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{generated}} by the Pacific electric ray can be enough to knock down an adult human. It should be treated with caution, especially at night when it is active, and {{has been known to}} charge at divers with its mouth agape if harassed. It is not known to be responsible for any fatalities, but may have been involved in several unexplained, fatal diving accidents. This species fares poorly in captivity, as it usually refuses to feed when first introduced into <b>an</b> <b>aquarium.</b> Since 2000, the Aquarium of the Bay and the Monterey Bay Aquarium have had some success keeping Pacific electric rays by offering them moving food.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} in the local area of occupation since the Iron Age, {{it was still a}} small village until the 19th century when it became a seaside resort, and was connected with local towns and cities by a railway, and two piers were built. The growth continued until {{the second half of the}} 20th century, when tourism declined and some local industries closed. A regeneration programme is being undertaken with attractions including the Helicopter Museum, Weston-super-Mare Museum, Grand Pier and <b>an</b> <b>aquarium.</b> The Paddle Steamer Waverley and MV Balmoral offer day sea trips from Knightstone Island to various destinations along the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary. Cultural venues include The Playhouse, the Winter Gardens and Blakehay Theatre.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{is home to}} a {{large number}} of museums and {{historical}} sites. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, and the DeCordova contemporary art and sculpture museum in Lincoln are all located within Massachusetts, and the Maria Mitchell Association in Nantucket includes several observatories, museums, and <b>an</b> <b>aquarium.</b> Historically themed museums and sites such as the Springfield Armory National Historic Site in Springfield, Boston's Freedom Trail and nearby Minute Man National Historical Park, both of which preserve a number of sites important during the American Revolution, the Lowell National Historical Park, which focuses on some of the earliest mills and canals of the industrial revolution in the US, the Black Heritage Trail in Boston, which includes important African-American and abolitionist sites in Boston, and the New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park all showcase various periods of Massachusetts's history.|$|E
5|$|The Mobile Medical Museum {{is housed}} in the {{historic}} French colonial-style Vincent-Doan House (1827). It features artifacts and resources that chronicle {{the long history of}} medicine in Mobile. The Phoenix Fire Museum is located in the restored Phoenix Volunteer Fire Company Number 6 building and features the history of fire companies in Mobile from their organization in 1838. The Mobile Police Department Museum features exhibits that chronicle the history of law enforcement in Mobile. The Gulf Coast Exploreum Science Center is a non-profit science center located in downtown. It features permanent and traveling exhibits, an IMAX dome theater, a digital 3D virtual theater, and a hands-on chemistry laboratory. The Dauphin Island Sea Lab is located south of the city, on Dauphin Island near the mouth of Mobile Bay. It houses the Estuarium, <b>an</b> <b>aquarium</b> which illustrates the four habitats of the Mobile Bay ecosystem: the river delta, bay, barrier islands and Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> reef <b>aquarium</b> or reef tank is <b>a</b> marine <b>aquarium</b> that {{prominently}} displays live corals {{and other}} marine invertebrates {{as well as}} fish that {{play a role in}} maintaining the tropical coral reef environment. <b>A</b> reef <b>aquarium</b> requires appropriately intense lighting, turbulent water movement, and more stable water chemistry than fish-only marine aquaria, and careful consideration is given to which reef animals are appropriate and compatible with each other.|$|R
50|$|In <b>a</b> small <b>aquarium,</b> one heater can be used; however, in <b>a</b> larger <b>aquarium,</b> {{two or more}} may be used. This has {{the added}} {{advantage}} of one heater being able to compensate {{in the event of}} one heater malfunctioning.|$|R

5|$|The dorsal spots {{make the}} {{spotted eagle ray}} <b>an</b> <b>aquarium</b> attraction, {{although}} because of its large size it is likely kept only at public aquariums. There are no target fisheries for the spotted eagle ray, but it is often eaten after being caught unintentionally as bycatch. There have been several reported incidents of spotted eagle rays leaping {{out of the water}} onto boats and landing on people. Nevertheless, spotted eagle rays do not pose a significant threat to humans, as they are shy and generally avoid human contact. Interactions with an individual snorkeler in the Caribbean has been reported especially in Jamaica involving one, two and even three spotted eagle rays. The rays may exhibit a behavior similar to human curiosity which allows the snorkeler to observe the eagle ray who may slow down so as to share more time with the much slower human observer if the human observer appears to be unthreatening or interesting to the spotted eagle ray.|$|E
5|$|When {{this episode}} was being produced, The Bachelorette was a {{bigger and more}} {{prolific}} program than when this episode was originally broadcast. In addition, ABC was not doing very well {{at the time of}} this episode's production. The production staff encountered some trouble when deciding what Peter would be doing in the lobby with Cleveland during his Bachelorette audition; although the series could never come up with ideas they deemed to be suitable, they intended for Peter to put his buttocks in <b>an</b> <b>aquarium</b> tank in order to embarrass Cleveland and make him want to leave. This scene was not used, and the production staff used a scene of Peter putting his naked buttocks on Cleveland's naked buttocks; they also shortened this more detailed version and used the less-detailed current version.|$|E
5|$|The pseudo-tracking shot {{in which}} the camera appears to {{approach}} the Man in the Moon was accomplished using an effect Méliès had invented the previous year for the film The Man with the Rubber Head. Rather than attempting to move his weighty camera toward an actor, he set a pulley-operated chair upon a rail-fitted ramp, placed the actor (covered up to the neck in black velvet) on the chair, and pulled him toward the camera. In addition to its technical practicality, this technique also allowed Méliès to control {{the placement of the}} face within the frame to a much greater degree of specificity than moving his camera allowed. A substitution splice allowed a model capsule to suddenly appear {{in the eye of the}} actor playing the Moon, completing the shot. Another notable sequence in the film, the plunge of the capsule into real ocean waves filmed on location, was created through multiple exposure, with a shot of the capsule falling in front of a black background superimposed upon the footage of the ocean. The shot is followed by an underwater glimpse of the capsule floating back to the surface, created by combining a moving cardboard cutout of the capsule with <b>an</b> <b>aquarium</b> containing tadpoles and air jets. The descent of the rocket from the Moon was covered in four shots, taking up about twenty seconds of film time.|$|E
25|$|Because {{goldfish}} eat live plants, {{their presence}} in <b>a</b> planted <b>aquarium</b> can be problematic. Only <b>a</b> few <b>aquarium</b> plant species for example Cryptocoryne and Anubias, can survive around goldfish, but they require special attention {{so that they are}} not uprooted. Plastic plants are more durable.|$|R

Marine aquariums can range in volume {{from less than}} 80 litres, (< 20 US gal) to over 1,200 litres (300 US gal). Small volumes {{are more difficult to}} maintain due to the more rapid changes in water chemistry. The majority of saltwater aquariums are between 160 and 400 litres (40 and 100 US gal).|$|E

25|$|The {{biological}} load, or bioload, is {{a measure}} of the burden placed on the aquarium ecosystem by its inhabitants. High biological loading presents a more complicated tank ecology, which in turn means that equilibrium is easier to upset. Several fundamental constraints on biological loading depend on aquarium size. The water's surface area limits oxygen intake. The bacteria population depends on the physical space they have available to colonize. Physically, only a limited size and number of plants and animals can fit into <b>an</b> <b>aquarium</b> while still providing room for movement. Biologically, biological loading refers to the rate of biological decay in proportion to tank volume. Adding plants to <b>an</b> <b>aquarium</b> will sometimes help greatly with taking up fish waste as plant nutrients. Although <b>an</b> <b>aquarium</b> can be overloaded with fish, an excess of plants is unlikely to cause harm. Decaying plant material, such as decaying plant leaves, can add these nutrients back into the aquarium if not promptly removed. The bioload is processed by the aquarium's biofilter filtration system.|$|E

25|$|An aquarium's {{physical}} characteristics form {{another aspect of}} aquarium design. Size, lighting conditions, density of floating and rooted plants, placement of bog-wood, creation of caves or overhangs, type of substrate, and other factors (including <b>an</b> <b>aquarium's</b> positioning within <b>a</b> room) can all affect the behavior and survival of tank inhabitants.|$|R
