5000|$|Some cis eQTLs are {{detected}} in many tissue types {{but the majority}} of trans eQTLs are tissue-dependent (dynamic). eQTLs may <b>act</b> <b>in</b> <b>cis</b> (locally) or trans (at a distance) to a gene. The abundance of a gene transcript is directly modified by polymorphism in regulatory elements. Consequently, transcript abundance might be considered as a quantitative trait that can be mapped with considerable power. These have been named expression QTLs (eQTLs) The combination of whole-genome genetic association studies and the measurement of global gene expression allows the systematic identification of eQTLs. By assaying geneexpression and genetic variation simultaneously on a genome-wide basis in a large number of individuals, statistical genetic methods can be used to map the genetic factors that underpin individual differences in quantitative levels of expression of many thousands oftranscripts. Studies have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reproducibly associated with complex disorders [...] as well as certain pharmacologic phenotypes [...] are found to be significantly enriched for eQTLs, relative to frequency-matched control SNPs.|$|E
5000|$|Natural {{antisense}} transcripts (NATs) are a {{group of}} RNAs encoded within a cell that have transcript complementarity to other RNA transcripts. [...] They {{have been identified in}} multiple eukaryotes, including humans, mice, yeast and Arabidopsis thaliana. [...] This class of RNAs includes both protein-coding and non-coding RNAs. [...] Current evidence has suggested a variety of regulatory roles for NATs, such as RNA interference (RNAi), alternative splicing, genomic imprinting, and X-chromosome inactivation. NATs are broadly grouped into two categories based on whether they <b>act</b> <b>in</b> <b>cis</b> or in trans. [...] Trans-NATs are transcribed from a different location than their targets and usually have complementarity to multiple transcripts with some mismatches. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are an example of trans-NATs that can target multiple transcripts with a few mismatches. Cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs) on the other hand are transcribed from the same genomic locus as their target but from the opposite DNA strand and form perfect pairs.|$|E

40|$|A genetic {{complementation}} system {{is described in}} which the complementing components are close together in a single linear DNA fragment; the complementation situation is temporary. This system is useful for providing transposition functions to transposition-defective transposons, since transposition functions <b>act</b> preferentially <b>in</b> <b>cis.</b> The basic procedure involves placing a transposition-defective transposon near the gene(s) for its transposition functions on a single DNA fragment. This fragment is introduced, here by general transduction, into a new host. The transposase <b>acts</b> <b>in</b> <b>cis</b> to permit the defective element to transpose from the introduced fragment into the recipient chromosome. The helper genes do not transpose and are lost by degradation and segregation. The method yields single insertion mutants that lack transposase and {{are not subject to}} further transposition or chromosome rearrangement.

5000|$|Processive antitermination can be {{mediated}} by RNA {{as well as}} proteins. Coliphage HK022, alone among the known lambdoid phages, does not encode an analog to lambda N. Instead, it promotes antitermination of early phage transcription through the direct action of transcribed sequences called put (for polymerase utilization) sites. There are two closely related put sites, one located in the PL operon and the other located in the PR operon, roughly corresponding to {{the positions of the}} nut sequences in lambda and in other lambda relatives. put sites <b>act</b> <b>in</b> <b>cis</b> to promote readthrough of downstream terminators in the absence of all HK022 proteins. The put transcripts are predicted to form two stem-loops separated by a single unpaired nucleotide. This prediction is supported by mutational studies and the pattern of sensitivity of the two RNAs to cleavage with single- and double-strand-specific endoribonucleases. RNA structure is critical to antitermination because mutations that prevent the formation of base pairs in the stems reduce function, and these mutations can be suppressed by additional mutations that restore base pairing. Like lambda N and Q, the PUT sequences suppress polymerase pausing and promote processive antitermination in a purified in vitro transcription system. In contrast to lambda N, no phage or auxiliary bacterial factors are required. The only mutations known to block PUT-mediated antitermination change highly conserved amino acids located in a cysteine-rich amino-proximal domain of the RNAP beta' subunit. Strains carrying these mutations are unable to support lytic growth of HK022 but are normal in all other respects tested, including lytic growth of lambda and other lambda relatives. The phage-restricted phenotypes conferred by these mutations suggest that they alter a domain of RNAP-beta’ that interacts specifically with nascent PUT RNA in the transcription elongation complex, but this idea has not been directly tested. The stability of the putative PUT-RNAP interaction {{and the nature of the}} PUT-induced modification to the elongation complex are unknown.|$|E

40|$|Expression of the tryptophanase (tna) operon of Escherichia coli is {{regulated}} by catabolite repression and by tryptophan-induced transcription antitermination at Rho-dependent termination {{sites in the}} leader region of the operon. Tryptophan induction is dependent on translation of a short leader peptide coding region, tnaC, that contains a single, crucial tryptophan codon. Recent studies suggest that during induction, the TnaC leader peptide <b>acts</b> <b>in</b> <b>cis</b> on the translating ribosome to inhibit its release at the tnaC stop codon. In the present study we use a tnaC-UGA-'lacZ construct lacking the tnaC-tnaA spacer region to analyze the effect of TnaC synthesis {{on the behavior of}} the ribosome that translates tnaC. The tnaC-UGA-'lacZ construct is not expressed significantly in {{the presence or absence of}} inducer. However, it is expressed in the presence of UGA suppressors, or when the structural gene for polypeptide release factor 3 is disrupted, or when wild-type tRNATrP is overproduced. In each situation, tnaC-UGA-'lacZ expression is reduced appreciably by the presence of inducing levels of tryptophan. Replacing the tnaC UGA stop codon with a sense codon allows considerable expression, which is also reduced, although to a lesser extent, by the addition of tryptophan. Inhibition by tryptophan is not observed when Trp codon 12 of tnaC is changed to a Leu codon. Overexpression of tnaC in trans from a multicopy plasmid prevents inhibition of expression by tryptophan. These results support the hypothesis that the TnaC leader peptide <b>acts</b> <b>in</b> <b>cis</b> to alter the behavior of the translating ribosome...|$|R

Ig genes must be transcribed for diversification to occur, but whether there are additional requirements for cis-activation has not been established. Here we show, by chromatin immunoprecipitation, that the regulatory factor E 2 A associates with the rearranged IgλR gene in the chicken DT 40 B cell line, which carries out constitutive Ig gene diversification. By analysis of a DT 40 derivative in which polymerized lactose operator tags the rearranged λR gene, we show that E 2 A must function <b>in</b> <b>cis</b> to promote diversification, and that stimulation of diversification <b>in</b> <b>cis</b> depends on the E 2 A activation domains. By direct imaging, we show that λR/E 2 A colocalizations are most prominent in G 1 phase of cell cycle. We further show that expression of the E 2 A antagonist Id 1 prevents λR/E 2 A colocalizations in G 1 phase, and impairs diversification but not transcription of λR. Thus, E 2 A <b>acts</b> <b>in</b> <b>cis</b> to promote Ig gene diversification, and G 1 phase is the critical window for E 2 A action...|$|R

To this end, we established telomerase-positive cell lines in which the targeting of these telomeric proteins to specific telomeres could be induced. We demonstrate that their targeting leads to telomere shortening. This indicates that these proteins <b>act</b> <b>in</b> <b>cis</b> to repress telomere elongation. Inhibition of telomerase activity by a modified oligonucleotide did not further increase the pace of telomere erosion caused by TRF 1 targeting, suggesting that telomerase itself is the target of TRF 1 regulation. In contrast, TRF 2 targeting and telomerase inhibition have additive effects. The possibility that TRF 2 can activate a telomeric degradation pathway was directly tested in human primary cells that do not express telomerase. In these cells, overexpression of full-length TRF 2 leads to an increased rate of telomere shortening...|$|E

The tp 4 mutation was mapped in the cY-cII region, and complementation tests indicated that tp 4 affects the diffusible product of the cII gene. The tp 4 mutation also reduced progeny production, but did not markedly affect endolysin synthesis. The establishment of immunity after X infec-tion requires expression of the cI gene; the prod-ucts of the cII and cIII genes are essential positive regulators of cI expression (5, 24).

Using mass-spectrometry-based quantitative analysis of noncanonical LTβR-induced signaling, we demonstrate that stimulation induces simultaneous processing of both p 100 and p 105. The precursors not only form hetero-oligomers but also interact with the ATPase VCP/p 97, and their induced proteolysis strictly depends on the signal response domain (SRD) of p 100, suggesting that the SRD-targeting proteolytic machinery <b>acts</b> <b>in</b> <b>cis</b> and <b>in</b> trans.

We used this relationship to analyze variation in replication timing among 161 individuals sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project. Genome-wide association of replication timing with genetic variation identified 16 loci at which inherited alleles associate with replication timing. We call these “replication timing quantitative trait loci” (rtQTLs). rtQTLs involved the differential use of replication origins, exhibited allele-specific effects on replication timing, and associated with gene expression variation at megabase scales.

40|$|Intriguing {{studies suggest}} that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) tend to <b>act</b> <b>in</b> <b>cis</b> with {{neighboring}} protein-coding genes. Based on this notion, we assessed whether lncRNAs originate from adjacent genomic regions of selected protein-coding genes, such as early-H 2 A histone and strim 1, that play important functions during development of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. Downregulation of H 2 A expression relies on the sns 5 chromatin insulator placed at the 3 '-end of H 2 A. Northern blot hybridization show that a lncRNA (of 600 nt), not overlapping with the H 2 A mRNA, is transcribed from sns 5, following H 2 A expression. The strim 1 locus encodes the first echinoderm TRIM-containing factor which functional role has been characterized. By RT-PCR and gene-transfer analysis we found that a lncRNA originates from the strim 1 gene promoter, and that its transcription positively correlates with that of strim 1. Our preliminary {{findings are consistent with}} the notion that lncRNAs might be important regulators for developmental processes...|$|E

In diploid genomes, the expression level of each allele conditions the degree to which sequence polymorphisms affect the phenotype. It is thus essential to quantify expression in an allele- and strand-specific manner. Using a custom-designed tiling array and a new computational approach, we piloted measuring allele- and strand-specific expression in yeast. Confident quantitative estimates of allele-specific expression were obtained for about half of the coding and non-coding transcripts of a heterozygous yeast strain, of which 371 transcripts (13 %) showed significant allelic differential expression greater than 1. 5 -fold. The data revealed complex allelic differential expression on opposite strands. Furthermore, combining allele-specific expression with linkage mapping enabled identifying allelic variants that <b>act</b> <b>in</b> <b>cis</b> and in trans to regulate allelic expression in the heterozygous strain.

40|$|Abstract: Antisense transcription, {{considered}} {{until recently}} as transcriptional noise, {{is a very}} common phenomenon in human and eukaryotic transcriptomes, operating in two ways based on whether the antisense RNA <b>acts</b> <b>in</b> <b>cis</b> or <b>in</b> trans. This process can generate long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), {{one of the most}} diverse classes of cellular transcripts, which have demonstrated multifunctional roles in fundamental biological processes, including embryonic pluripotency, differentiation and development. Antisense lncRNAs have been shown to control nearly every level of gene regulation—pretranscriptional, transcriptional and posttranscriptional—through DNA–RNA, RNA–RNA or protein–RNA interactions. This review is centered on functional studies of antisense lncRNA-mediated regulation of neighboring gene expression. Specifically, it addresses how these transcripts interact with other biological molecules, nucleic acids and proteins, to regulate gene expression through chromatin remodeling at the pretranscriptional level and modulation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes by altering the sense mRNA structure or the cellular compartmental distribution, either in the nucleus or the cytoplasm...|$|R

Comparison of islet FAIRE-seq to five non-islet cell lines revealed ~ 3, 300 physically linked clusters of islet-selective open chromatin sites, which typically encompassed single genes exhibiting islet-specific expression.

This gene, which is situated immediately upstream of glnII, was identified by means of a deletion/ complementation analysis performed in the hetero-logous background of Klebsiella pneumoniae. It has been designated gstI (glutamine synthetase trans-lational Inhibitor) because, when a complete version of gstI is present, it is possible to detect glnII-specific mRNA, but neither GSII activity nor GSII protein.

LRP 4 in HEK 293 cells increased synapsin or SV 2 puncta in contacting axons of cocultured neurons, suggesting a synaptogenic function. Analysis of LRP 4 muscle and motoneuron double mutants and mechanistic studies suggest that NMJ formation may also be regulated by LRP 4 in motoneurons, which could serve as agrin's receptor in trans to induce AChR clusters.

Sequence comparison suggests that the yeast cytoplasmic (or mature mitochondrial) ValRS contains an N-terminal appendage that <b>acts</b> <b>in</b> <b>cis</b> as a nonspecific tRNA-binding domain (TRBD) and is absent from its bacterial relatives. We show here that Escherichia coli ValRS can substitute for the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic functions of VAS 1 by fusion of a mitochondrial targeting signal and a TRBD, respectively. In addition, the bacterial ValRS gene can be converted into a dual functional yeast gene encoding both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial activities by fusion of a DNA sequence specifying both the mitochondrial targeting signal and TRBD. In vitro assays suggested that fusion of a nonspecific TRBD to the bacterial enzyme significantly enhanced its yeast tRNA-binding and aminoacylation activities. These results not only underscore the necessity of retaining a TRBD for functioning of a tRNA synthetase in yeast cytoplasm, but also provide insights into the evolution of tRNA synthetase genes...|$|R
40|$|We have {{identified}} a locus essential for galacturonate utilization in Bacillus subtilis. Genes homologous to Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi glucuronate and galacturonate metabolic genes were found in a cluster consisting of 10 open reading frames (ORFs) in the B. subtilis chromosome. A mutant of B. subtilis containing a replacement of {{the second and third}} ORFs was unable to grow with galacturonate as its primary carbon source. Galacturonate induced expression from a ςA-dependent promoter, exuP 1, located upstream from the first ORF. The eighth ORF in this cluster (the exu locus) encodes a LacI and GalR homolog that negatively regulated expression from exuP 1. A 26 -bp inverted repeat sequence centered 15 bp downstream from the exuP 1 start point of transcription <b>acted</b> <b>in</b> <b>cis</b> to negatively regulate expression from exuP 1 under noninducing conditions. Expression from the exuP 1 promoter was repressed by high levels of glucose, which is probably mediated by CcpA (catabolite control protein A). A ςE-dependent promoter, exuP 2, was localized between the second and third ORFs and was active during sporulation...|$|R
40|$|The phase {{variation}} of type 1 fimbriation in Escherichia coli {{is associated with}} the inversion of a short DNA element. This element (switch) <b>acts</b> <b>in</b> <b>cis</b> to control transcription of fimA, the major fimbrial subunit gene. Thus, fimA is transcribed when the switch is in one orientation (the on orientation) but not the other (the off orientation). The fim inversion requires either fimB (on-to-off or off-to-on inversion) or fimE (on-to-off inversion only), as well as integration host factor, and is also influenced by the abundant DNA-binding protein H-NS. Here we report that an additional gene, lrp, a factor known to influence the expression of both Pap and K 99 fimbriae, is also required for normal activity of the fim switch. The frequencies of both fimB-promoted and fimE-promoted inversions, and consequently the {{phase variation}} of type 1 fimbriation, are lower in lrp mutants. Lrp affects slightly the transcription of both fimB (which is increased) and fimE (which is decreased). We believe that these alterations in fimB and fimE transcription alone are unlikely to account for the sharp reduction in switching found in lrp mutants...|$|R
