50|$|The {{requested}} {{budget was}} submitted by President Clinton on February 6, 1995, just five {{weeks after the}} beginning of the 104th United States Congress, which was dominated by Republicans to had been victorious in the November 1994 midterm election. Clinton's requested budget provided <b>a</b> <b>middle-class</b> <b>tax</b> cut, including new deductions for children and college expenses, which was offset by a twice-as-large reduction in spending elsewhere in the budget, echoing Speaker Gingrich's goal to eliminate programs that had outlived their usefulness. However, Republicans had demanded a budget that would lead to a balanced budget in 2002, but Clinton's budget projected annual deficits of around $190 billion up to 2005. Clinton's plan also proposed to abolish the Interstate Commerce Commission, and reorganize the Departments of Energy, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development by consolidating programs into fewer, larger ones, as well as the Office of Personnel Management and the General Services Administration by cutting their staff by a third and a half, respectively.|$|E
40|$|We empirically {{assess the}} {{distributional}} impacts and welfare effects of policies to incentivize renewable electricity production {{for the case}} of Italy. We use data from the Household Budget Survey between 2000 and 2010 to estimate a demand system in which energy goods' shares of expenditure are modelled using different empirical approaches. We show that the general Exact Affine Stone Index (EASI) demand system provides more robust estimates of price elasticities of each composite good than the commonly used Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS). The estimated coefficients are used to perform a welfare analysis of the Italian renewable electricity production incentive policy. We show that different empirical approaches give rise to significantly different estimates of price elasticities and that methodological choices are {{the reasons for the}} very high elasticities of substitutions estimated using similar data by previous contributions. We find no evidence of regressivity of the incidence of the Italian renewable incentive scheme in the period under consideration. The renewable subsidies act as <b>a</b> <b>middle-class</b> <b>tax,</b> with the higher welfare losses experienced by households in the second to fourth quintiles of the expenditure distribution...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the final}} presidential debate, McCain and {{his running mate}} Sarah Palin {{frequently}} repeated the charge in campaign speeches that [...] "Joe the Plumber" [...] would pay higher taxes under Obama and Biden's plan, although according to tax analysts neither Wurzelbacher nor the company he works for would actually be subject to higher taxes under Obama's tax plan.
