40|$|In this work, we {{analyzed}} the kinetic properties of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) extracted from >cherimoya> (Annona cherimola Mill.) fruits ripened {{at ambient temperature}} (20 C) and stored under several environmental conditions, including high CO 2 levels (20 %) and low temperature (6 C). The effect of different ammonia-related compounds on cherimoya PAL activity was also evaluated. PAL exhibited two different Km values for L-phenylalanine (L-Phe) and negative substrate cooperativity, with Hill coefficient (napp) values reaching 0. 64 and 0. 71 for low temperature and high CO 2 levels, respectively. The kinetic analysis revealed that ammonia produced mixed inhibition of PAL enzyme, with inhibition constants (Ki and Ki′ values of 0. 57 ± 0. 2 mM and 2. 54 ± 0. 2 mM. We propose that the regulation of PAL by ammonia inhibition and the negative cooperativity may be essential in adjusting the active phenylpropanoid metabolism in <b>Annonas</b> to the requirement of L-Phe and in consequence, to the carbon skeleton demand for other anabolic pathways. © 2007, Blackwell Publishing.

40|$|Brazil is a {{very large}} country with a diverse climate. This fact allows a {{diversity}} of plants to grow ranging from tropical rainforest in the Amazon, passing through Atlantic Forest along the coast, the cerrados (Brazilian savannah) in the Central West region, and semi-arid area in the Northeast. Latitude ranges from 5 º N to 33 º S, with most of this territory in the tropical region. There are enough reasons to plant breeders devoting great amount of their effort to improve plants suitable for warm climates, though. Among fruit crops, results of breeder's work have been noticed in several species, especially on peaches, grapes, citrus, apples, persimmons, figs, pears and others not so common, such as acerola, guava, <b>annonas</b> (sour sop, sugar apple, atemoya, cherimoya) and passion fruit. Peach tree introduced at low latitude (22 ± 2 ºS) requires climatic adaptation to subtropical conditions of low chilling.

40|$|Annonaceae is {{an ancient}} family of plants {{including}} approximately 50 genera growing worldwide in a quite restricted area with specific agroclimatic requirements. Only few species of this family has been cultivated and exploited commercially {{and most of them}} belonging to the genus Annona such as A. muricata, A. squamosa, the hybrid A. cherimola x A. squamosa and specially Annona cherimola: the cherimoya, commercially cultivated in Spain, Chile, California, Florida, México, Australia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, New Zealand and several countries in South and Central America. The cherimoya shows a high degree of heterozygosis, and to obtain homogeneous and productive orchards it is necessary to avoid the propagation by seeds of this species. Additionally, the traditional methods of vegetative propagation were inefficient and inadequate, due to the low morphogenetic potential of this species, and the low rooting rate. The in vitro tissue culture methods of micropropagation can be applied successfully to cherimoya and other Annona sp to overcome these problems. Most of the protocols of micropropagation and regeneration were developed using the cultivar Fino de Jete, which is the major cultivar in Spain. First it is developed the method to micropropagate the juvenile material of cherimoya (ENCINA et al., 1994), and later it was optimized a protocol to micropropagate adult cherimoya genotypes selected by outstanding agronomical traits (PADILLA and ENCINA, 2004) and further it was improved the process through micrografting (PADILLA and ENCINA, 2011).
