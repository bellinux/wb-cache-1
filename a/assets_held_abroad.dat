50|$|In April 2008, Georgia sold a 51 {{percent stake}} of the Poti port {{area to the}} Ras Al Khaimah Investment Authority (RAKIA), a company owned by the emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, {{a member of the}} United Arab Emirates (UAE). RAKIA was tasked with {{managing}} the new port terminal and, through its Georgian subsidiary RAKIA Georgia Free Industrial Zone LLC, with developing a Free Industrial Zone (FIZ) in a 49-year management concession. The new FIZ was officially inaugurated by the President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili on 15 April 2008. In 2009, RAKIA UAE acquired the remaining 49 percent stake of the port. However, following the Dubai debt crisis of November 2009, Sheikh Sheikh Saud Bin Saqr decided to sell off most <b>assets</b> <b>held</b> <b>abroad</b> in October 2010. This focus on domestic priorities was prompted by the disputed succession in Ras Al Khaimah following the death of Saud's father, Sheikh Saqr Bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, and the need for Saud Bin Saqr to provide for his subjects. Subsequently, 80 percent of the port was sold in April 2011 to APM Terminals, a unit of Denmark's A.P. Moller-Maersk. On 8 September 2011, RAKIA Georgia FIZ decided to alienate 15 percent of its shares in favor of Georgian businessman Gela ("Zaza") Mikadze in recognition of his management, making him a minority partner in the FIZ. Mikadze owns these shares through the UK based Manline Projects LLP company, which is owned by offshore companies belonging to Mikadze.|$|E

5000|$|Although Ras Al Khaimah is a poorer {{sheikhdom}} in {{the north}} of the UAE, Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi had instructed RAKIA to invest in Georgia a few years prior to his accession as ruler of Ras Al Khaimah in 2010. Against the background of Saud's dispute with his half-brother Sheikh Khaled bin Saqr Al Qasimi concerning each other's claims to the throne, these investments were interpreted as hedging against a possible failure of Saud's bid for leadership in Ras Al Khaimah. In the event of failure, Sheikh Saud had planned having large assets outside the UAE. That his succession was far from being certain is confirmed {{by the fact that it}} took a light military intervention of Abu Dhabi federal troops to ensure Saud's claim over the one of his elder half-brother Khaled when their father Sheikh Saqr bin Muhammad Al Qasimi died in October 2010. Once in power, Saud faced the impact of the Dubai financial crisis on public finances as well as homegrown discontent, notably in the form of the Al-Islah movement that demanded public participation and accountability in the UAE in general and in Ras Al Khaimah in particular. The Al-Islah movement represented the UAE variation of political uprisings in the region commonly summarized under the Arab Spring. The domestic challenges prompted Saud to adopt a general policy of selling all <b>assets</b> <b>held</b> <b>abroad</b> and not engaging in future investments outside Ras Al Khaimah. One of the leaders of the Al-Islah movement, Saud's long-time legal adviser Muhammad Al-Mansuri (Mohammad Al-Mansoori), was tried among the so-called [...] "UAE 94" [...] political activists. On 2 July 2013 he was one of 68 government critics convicted by the State Security Court in Abu Dhabi of “plotting to overthrow the state”. He received a ten years jail term in a judicial process described by international observers as grossly unfair.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the Tax Reform Act of 1986 on the international location decisions of U. S. financial services firms. The Act included rule changes that made it substantially more difficult for U. S. firms to defer U. S. taxes on overseas financial services income held in low-tax jurisdictions. These same rule changes were not applied to other forms of income; in particular, income generated from active manufacturing operations was still eligible for deferral after the Act. We use information from the tax returns of U. S. corporations to examine how local taxes affect the allocation of <b>assets</b> <b>held</b> <b>abroad.</b> We find that, before the Act, the location of assets in financial subsidiaries was responsive to differences in host country tax rates across jurisdictions. However, after the Act, differences in host country tax rates no longer explain the distribution of assets held in financial services subsidiaries abroad. In contrast, we find that assets held in manufacturing subsidiaries have become more sensitive to variations in tax rates. Our results suggest that the tightening of the anti-deferral provisions applicable to financial services companies has been successful in neutralizing the effect of host country income taxes on investment location decisions. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{previous}} {{literature on}} multinational financial policy has, {{for the most}} part, been restricted to the choice between dividend distributions to the parent and further real investment in the foreign affiliate. We argue that investment in financial assets such as the debt and equity of related affiliates or Eurodollar deposits, for example, offer multinationals attractive alternatives to dividend repatriation. We present theoretical models that illustrate how investment and financial incentives change when the possibility of investing in financial assets {{is added to the}} analysis. Our models depart from previous work in several important ways. We drop the standard arbitrage condition in which equity and debt are perfect substitutes from the viewpoint of the firm and instead impose a worldwide financial constraint consistent with a rising cost of debt finance. In our models, parents can borrow against financial <b>assets</b> <b>held</b> <b>abroad</b> and may allocate debt across locations to achieve the lowest cost of capital at home and abroad. We also consider the implications of models in which affiliates can invest in related affiliates in other foreign countries. We use firm level balance sheet data from controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) available in the Treasury tax files to test the implications of our models. Our regression results confirm the importance of tax considerations in explaining CFC holdings of financial assets. We also find that CFCs with more debt distribute more dividends. This provides evidence that greater dividend distributions do not necessarily imply lower real investment by CFCs. financial policy; international taxation; investment policy; multinational; repatriation decisions;...|$|E
40|$|We use {{data from}} the balance sheets of {{controlled}} foreign corporations,(CFCs) to study the real and financial behavior of U. S. multinational corporations. Previous literature on repatriations has mostly been restricted to the choice between dividend distributions to the parent and further real investment in the CFC. The balance sheet data allows us to study {{a broader range of}} financial flows between CFCs and parents. Our theoretical work considers models that depart from the previous work in several important ways. We drop the standard arbitrage condition in which the after-tax return to equity and debt is equalized on the margin and instead impose a worldwide financial constraint consistent with a rising cost of debt finance. In our model, parents can borrow against financial <b>assets</b> <b>held</b> <b>abroad</b> and may allocate debt across locations to achieve the lowest cost of capital at home and abroad. We also consider the implications of models in which CFCs can invest in CFCs in other foreign countries. We explain how low-tax CFCs can repatriate tax-free by investing in high-tax CFCs that are repatriating income to parent corporations. Our theoretical results confirm that financial assets, including the equity or debt of other CFCs, are attractive alternatives to repatriation and investment in real assets. We show that if the parent can borrow against its CFC's financial assets it can achieve the equivalent of a dividend repatriation. Our regression results confirm the importance of tax considerations in explaining CFC holdings of financial assets. Low-tax CFCs invest in financial assets in order to avoid U. S. taxes on repatriations. CFCs in high-tax locations are much more highly leveraged than low-tax CFCs. ...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{show how}} the various methods {{commonly}} used to measure capital flight produce vastly different estimates (with a 100 percent difference between the lowest and the highest, in Mexico's case). They {{emphasize the importance of}} the conceptual approach to its measurement. First of all, they did not try to separate normal capital flows from capital flight. A capital shift outward because of expected taxation is as much a response to anticipated developments in rate of return as is a shift out in response to lower interest rates at home. Nor is it satisfactory to directly measure capital flight by taking short-term asset changes and the balance of errors and omissions from the balance of payments. Neither is necessarily related to the unreported private accumulation of foreign assets. They chose the residual approach, which assumes that capital inflows in the form of increases in external indebtedness and foreign direct investment should finance either the current account or reserve accumulation; any shortfall in reported use can be attributed to capital flight. Implementing the residual approach requires careful data selection and several adjustments. The authors contend that: introducing debt stock data into the analysis - instead of the changes in debt recorded directly in the balance of payments - requires many difficult adjustments and should be avoided; foreign asset changes of public corporations must be subtracted; rather than eliminate interest received on foreign assets from the current account, as some have done, earnings on private <b>assets</b> <b>held</b> <b>abroad</b> should be considered part of the flight capital that might have been repatriated, given different incentives and macroeconomic conditions; and the effect on capital flight of the faking of trade invoices should be assessed, since import overinvoicing and export underinvoicing can be used to channel capital abroad. They demonstrate the empirical importance of these choices with a new set of capital flight estimates for Mexico, based on the recommendations they present. They contrast the results of this approach with those of other approaches, to demonstrate the effect of conceptual choices.
