The game engine and most of the interface were transferred from its predecessor to Jumping Flash! 2 in order to save time during the development. Despite the initial similarities the developers decided to give Jumping Flash! 2 a much larger draw distance, higher quality textures, <b>and</b> <b>updated</b> enemy AI in order to give the game a more memorable first-person 3D perspective. Jumping Flash! 2 was not designed to be a technology demonstrator, unlike its predecessor.|$|E

USB to CEC adapters exist that allow a computer to control CEC-enabled devices.|$|E

The Brigade stood up provisionally on 27 June 2008 as it neared ready status. On 23 October, the brigade's colors were formally uncased at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. This signified the end of the brigade's relocation to Hawaii as well as its completion and readiness to take on new missions.|$|E

By May 1945, Belfast mounted thirty-six 2-pounder guns in two eight-gun mounts, four quadruple mounts, and four single mounts. She also mounted fourteen 20mm Oerlikons. Her two aftmost 4-inch mountings were removed, and the remainder fitted with Remote Power Control. Her empty hangars were converted to crew accommodation, and her aircraft catapult was removed.|$|E

5|$|Safety {{features}} on Lexus models range from {{stability and handling}} programs (Vehicle Stability Control and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management) to backup cameras, swivel headlights, and sonar warning systems. The Lexus Pre-Collision System (PCS) integrates multiple safety systems. In 2007, Lexus introduced the first car safety systems with infrared and pedestrian detection capabilities, lane keep assist, a Driver Monitoring System with facial recognition monitoring of driver attentiveness, and rear pre-collision whiplash protection, {{as part of the}} LS 460 PCS. As a safety precaution, Lexus GPS navigation systems in many regions feature a motion lockout when the vehicle reaches a set speed; to prevent distraction, navigation inputs are limited, while voice input and certain buttons are still accessible. This safety feature has attracted criticism because passengers cannot use certain functions when the vehicle is in motion. Pre-2007 models came with a hidden manufacturer override option, <b>and</b> <b>updated</b> European models allow operation in motion.|$|E

This port was released on the PlayStation Network on September 8, 2010. It was also ported to Microsoft Windows for the i-Revo PC system in 2006. The Super Famicom version has been ported to Nintendo's Virtual Console for Wii and Wii U. A port of the game for Android and iOS smartphones was released on March 22, 2013, marking the game's first appearance on a portable platform.|$|E
5|$|Space Invaders {{has been}} remade on {{numerous}} platforms and spawned many sequels. Re-releases include ported <b>and</b> <b>updated</b> {{versions of the}} original arcade game. Ported versions generally feature different graphics and additional gameplay optionsâ€”for example, moving defense bunkers, zigzag shots, invisible aliens, and two-player cooperative gameplay. Ports on earlier systems like the Atari home consoles featured simplified graphics, while later systems such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and PlayStation featured updated graphics. Later titles include several modes of gameplay and integrate new elements into the original design. For example, Space Invaders Extreme, released on the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable, integrated musical elements into the standard gameplay. A spin-off for WiiWare, Space Invaders Get Even, allows players to control the aliens instead of the laser cannon.|$|E
