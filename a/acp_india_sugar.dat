Results: Early trimester colour Doppler ultrasonography has an excellent role to play as a predictor of pregnancy induced hypertension.

On the other hand, by the 1890 s, Grenada and Jamaica had built up substantial alternative industries. But there were colonies in the state of extreme depression. The sugar-cane industries in such colonies as St. Vincent and Tobago were threatened with serious reduction or extinction. Many sugar estates are being abandoned and thrown out of cultivation. Alternative industries have not built up. That caused distress among the working class.
