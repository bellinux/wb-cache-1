He let the <b>air</b> <b>escape</b> from his pursed-up lips like a man blowing at a spoonful of hot soup. But when the servant in brown appeared at the door silently, Mr Verloc had not moved an inch from the place he had occupied throughout the interview. He had remained motionless, as if feeling himself surrounded by pitfalls.|$|E

6000|$|He avenged {{himself for}} the artist's profanation of his first attempt to {{approach}} Miss Francie by indulging {{at the end of}} another week in a second. He went about six o'clock, when he supposed she would have returned from her day's wanderings, and his prudence was rewarded by the sight of the young lady sitting in the court of the hotel with her father and sister. Mr. Dosson was new to Gaston Probert, but the young man might have been a naturalist visiting a rank country with a net of such narrow meshes as to let no creature of the <b>air</b> <b>escape.</b> The little party was as usual expecting Mr. Flack at any moment, and they had collected downstairs, so that he might pick them up easily. They had, on the first floor, an expensive parlour, decorated in white and gold, with sofas of crimson damask; but there was something lonely in that grandeur and the place had become mainly a receptacle for their tall trunks, with a half-emptied paper of chocolates or marrons glaces on every table. After young Probert's first call his name was often on the lips of the simple trio, and Mr. Dosson grew still more jocose, making nothing of a secret of his perception that Francie hit the bull's-eye [...] "every time." [...] Mr. Waterlow had returned their visit, but that was rather a matter of course, since it was they who had gone after him. They had not gone after the other one; it was he who had come after them. When he entered the hotel, as they sat there, this pursuit and its probable motive became startlingly vivid.|$|E
6000|$|He {{knew that}} the brig had arrived, {{though he did not}} know that Jasper was already with his daughter. I suppose he didn't think it was {{possible}} in the time. A father naturally wouldn't. He suspected that Allen was sweet on his girl; the fowls of the air and the fishes of the sea, most of the traders in the Archipelago, and all sorts and conditions of men in the town of Singapore were aware of it. But he was not capable of appreciating how far the girl was gone on the fellow. He had an idea that Freya was too sensible to ever be gone on anybody--I mean to an unmanageable extent. No; it was not that which made him sit on the back verandah and worry himself in his unassuming manner during Jasper's visits. What he worried about were the Dutch [...] "authorities." [...] For {{it is a fact that}} the Dutch looked askance at the doings of Jasper Allen, owner and master of the brig Bonito. They considered him much too enterprising in his trading. I don't know that he ever did anything illegal; but it seems to me that his immense activity was repulsive to their stolid character and slow-going methods. Anyway, in old Nelson's opinion, the captain of the Bonito was a smart sailor, and a nice young man, but not a desirable acquaintance upon the whole. Somewhat compromising, you understand. On the other hand, he did not like to tell Jasper in so many words to keep away. Poor old Nelson himself was a nice fellow. I believe he would have shrunk from hurting the feelings even of a mop-headed cannibal, unless, perhaps, under very strong provocation. I mean the feelings, not the bodies. As against spears, knives, hatchets, clubs, or arrows, old Nelson had proved himself capable of taking his own part. In every other respect he had a timorous soul. So he sat on the back verandah with a concerned expression, and whenever the voices of his daughter and Jasper Allen reached him, he would blow out his cheeks and let the <b>air</b> <b>escape</b> with a dismal sound, like a much tried man.|$|E

50|$|A {{flat tire}} (British English: flat tyre) is a {{deflated}} pneumatic tire, {{which can cause}} {{the rim of the}} wheel to ride on the tire tread or the ground potentially resulting in loss of control of the vehicle or irreparable damage to the tire.

5000|$|Murmur (also called breathy voice, whispery voice, soughing and susurration) is a {{phonation}} {{in which}} the vocal folds vibrate, {{as they do in}} normal (modal) voicing, but are adjusted to let more <b>air</b> <b>escape</b> which produces a sighing-like sound.

50|$|Posterior {{pharyngeal}} flap {{surgery is}} {{the most commonly used}} operation to restore velopharyngeal competence (i.e., develop a functional seal between the nasal cavity and the oral cavity), and therefore correct hypernasality and nasal <b>air</b> <b>escape</b> (Ysunza et al., 2002). Posterior pharyngeal flaps can be based superiorly or inferiorly and the velum can be split transversely or along the midline (Lideman-Boshki et al., 2005). Centrally positioned, superior based flaps continue to be the most popular pharyngeal flap choice, yet inferior based flaps are easier for the surgeon to perform. Compared to superiorly based flaps, inferiorly based flaps are limited in regard to the size of velopharyngeal opening that can be covered (Peterson-Falzone et al., 2001).|$|E

50|$|The term nasometry is {{generally}} {{used to refer}} to non-invasive techniques for measuring the size of the opening, as opposed to endoscopic or other visual methods. During vowel sounds, nasometry usually refers to the use of a system for measuring nasalance. During consonants, Nasometry usually refers to the measurement of <b>air</b> <b>escaping</b> past the velum and escaping through the nose. This <b>escaping</b> <b>air</b> is referred to as nasal emission.|$|R
