5000|$|NAPE-PLD is {{an enzyme}} {{activity}} - a phospholipase, acting on phospholipids {{found in the}} cell membrane. It is not homology but the chemical outcome of its activity that classes it as phospholipase D. The enzymatic activity was discovered and characterized {{in a series of}} experiments culminating in the 2004 publication of a biochemical purification scheme from which peptide sequencing could be accomplished. [...] Researchers homogenized (finely ground) hearts from 150 rats and subjected the resulting crude lysate to sucrose sedimentation at 105,000 x g to separate out the cell membranes from the remainder of the cell. The integral membrane proteins were then solubilized using octyl glucoside and subjected to four column chromatography steps (HiTrap SP HP cation-exchange column, HiTrap Q <b>anion-exchange</b> <b>column,</b> HiTrap Blue affinity column, Bio-Gel HTP hydroxyapatite column). Each of these separates the different types of membrane proteins into different sample containers when the proteins are eluted from the column over time, and by measuring the activity of samples in each container it was possible to track which ones received the active enzyme. Measurement of the enzyme activity was done by thin layer chromatography of a radioactive substrate sensitive to the NAPE-PLD enzymatic activity: Cleavage of the substrate affected where it appeared on the plate when the radiation was detected on a bioimaging analyzer.|$|E

40|$|Elicitors of {{phytoalexin}} accumulation in soybean (Glycine max L. Merr., cv Wayne) cotyledons {{were released}} from soybean cell walls and from citrus pectin by partial acid hydrolysis. These two hydrolysates yielded nearly identical distributions of elicitor activity when fractionated on <b>anion-exchange</b> <b>columns.</b> Chromatography of the pectin elicitor on gel filtration and high-pressure <b>anion-exchange</b> <b>columns</b> did not further purify the elicitor.

Glycosyl residue compositions of the purified elicitors from cell walls and pectin were both found to be approximately 98 % galacturonosyl residues. Linkage analysis of the pectin elicitor showed that most, if not all, of the galacturonosyl residues were α- 1, 4 -linked. The high-mass molecular ions detected by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry {{of the most active}} elicitor fractions from cell walls and pectin both corresponded precisely to a molecule composed of 12 galacturonosyl residues.

40|$|An <b>anion-exchange</b> <b>column</b> {{coupled with}} an amperometric sensor {{was used for the}} {{quantitative}} analysis of alditols and simple sugars. The sensing electrode is composed of cuprous oxide dispersed in a graphite powder-polyethylene composite matrix. The resulting Cu 2 O-carbon composite electrode is stable in alkaline media and possesses good sensitivity, wide linear dynamic ranges and low detection limits for alditols, mono- and disaccharides. Alditols and carbohydrates are weakly ionizable compounds, so an <b>anion-exchange</b> <b>column</b> was employed for their chromatographic separation with an alkaline eluent. The separation problems due to the presence of low but uncontrolled amounts of carbonate in the alkaline mobile phase have been largely solved by the addition of Ca 2 + or Ba 2 + at a millimolar level and the consequent formation of carbonate insoluble salts. Using this strategy, the alkaline eluent provides improved separations without compromising the column's lifetime, electrode performance and chromatographic system. Under the optimal operating conditions, the detection limits of D-sorbitol, D-mannitol and D-glucose were 50, 40 and 80 pmol, respectively, with a linear concentration range up to 5 mM.

40|$|An {{optimization}} {{strategy for}} the separation and analysis of class III metallothioneins from a complex matrix by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) is presented and illustrated. Metallothioneins are a group of polypeptides used for many organisms to alleviate stresses imposed by exposure to heavy-metal excess.

In the present paper, a rapid and simple separation technique by CZE with an uncoated polyimide-clad fused-silica capillary is described. This technique permits the analysis of these molecules without prior steps of purification and derivatization.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a method to analyze stable carbon isotope (13 C/ 12 C) ratios {{in a variety of}} carbohydrates using high-performance liquid chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (HPLC/IRMS). The chromatography is based on strong <b>anion-exchange</b> <b>columns</b> with low strength NaOH eluents. An eluent concentration of 1 mM resulted in low background signals and good separation of most of the typical plant neutral carbohydrates. We also show that more strongly bound carbohydrates such as acidic carbohydrates can be separated by inclusion of NO as an inorganic pusher ion in the eluent. Analyses of neutral carbohydrate concentrations and their stable carbon isotope ratios are shown for plant materials and marine sediment samples both at natural abundance and for 13 C-enriched samples. The main advantage of HPLC/IRMS analysis over traditional gas chromatography based methods is that no derivatization is needed resulting in simple sample treatment and improved accuracy and reproducibility. ...|$|R
