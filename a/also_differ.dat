5|$|The two {{projects}} <b>also</b> <b>differ</b> {{significantly in}} their computing power and host diversity. Averaging about 6,650 teraFLOPS from a host base of {{central processing units}} (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and PS3s, Folding@home has nearly 108 times more computing power than Rosetta@home.|$|E
5|$|All IQ {{tests show}} {{variation}} in scores {{even when the}} same person takes the same test over and over again. IQ scores <b>also</b> <b>differ</b> for a test-taker taking tests {{from more than one}} publisher at the same age. The various test publishers do not use uniform names or definitions for IQ score classifications. All these issues must be kept in mind when interpreting an individual's IQ scores, because they all can result in different IQ classifications for the same person at different times.|$|E

5|$|Canada's federal {{structure}} divides government responsibilities {{between the}} federal government and the ten provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons. Canada's three territories also have legislatures, but these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces. The territorial legislatures <b>also</b> <b>differ</b> structurally from their provincial counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Northwest Argentina is {{predominantly}} dry, hot, and subtropical. Owing to its rugged and varied topography, {{the region is}} climatically diverse, depending on the altitude, temperature and distribution of precipitation. Consequently, the vegetation will <b>also</b> <b>differ.</b> Under the Köppen climate classification, the region has five different climate types: semi–arid (BS), arid (BW), temperate without a dry season and temperate with a dry season (Cf and CW respectively), and, at the highest altitudes, an alpine.|$|E

5|$|Sources differ {{about the}} cities hosting {{some of the}} early IMOs. This may be partly because leaders are {{generally}} housed well away from the students, and partly because after the competition the students did not always stay based in one city {{for the rest of the}} IMO. The exact dates cited may <b>also</b> <b>differ,</b> because of leaders arriving before the students, and at more recent IMOs the IMO Advisory Board arriving before the leaders.|$|E
5|$|The legal {{elements}} and {{features of the}} major federal public corruption offenses differ. The various jurisdictional elements of the offenses require that the prosecution prove, alternatively: that the payee was a federal official; that the payee organization received $10,000 in federal funds; that the corrupt communications involved {{the use of the}} mail or interstate wires; that the corruption affected interstate commerce or interstate travel. The mens rea elements differ in whether they require a quid pro quo; a mere nexus is an easier element to prove; more difficult elements to prove include the intent to be influenced and inducement. The offenses <b>also</b> <b>differ</b> in whether the act to be procured from the public official must be an official, a violation of an official duty, a fraud on the United States, or an official transaction. The offenses <b>also</b> <b>differ</b> in whether the payor may be prosecuted in addition to the public official. Finally, the offenses differ in whether they are predicates for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and money laundering prosecutions, and in the maximum authorized prison sentence that may be imposed upon conviction.|$|E
5|$|The {{two species}} of Voalavo are only subtly {{different}} in morphology. With a body mass of , the eastern voalavo is a small rodent. It has a longer tail than the northern voalavo, {{as well as a}} longer rostrum (front part of the skull) and diastema (gap between the incisors and molars), but shorter molar rows. The two species <b>also</b> <b>differ</b> in details of the configuration of the palate.|$|E

Signalling systems <b>also</b> <b>differ.</b> In addition to the infrastructure difficulties, any potential Eurostar services beyond Paris and Brussels would also require the installation of stringent security measures, due to the UK's not having signed up to the Schengen Agreement, which allows unrestricted movement across borders of member countries.|$|E
5|$|Weather fronts are {{boundaries}} between two masses of air of different densities, or different temperature and moisture properties, which normally are convergence zones {{in the wind}} field and are the principal cause of significant weather. Within surface weather analyses, they are depicted using various colored lines and symbols. The air masses usually differ in temperature and may <b>also</b> <b>differ</b> in humidity. Wind shear in the horizontal occurs near these boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Dalhousie is a {{publicly}} funded research university, {{and a member}} of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, as well as the U15, a group of Canadian research-intensive universities. , there were 18,220 students enrolled at the university and 3,700 courses in over 190 degree programs. Dalhousie offers more than 3,700 courses and 190 degree programs in twelve undergraduate, graduate, and professional faculties. The requirements for admission differ between students from Nova Scotia, students from other provinces in Canada, and international students due to lack of uniformity in marking schemes. The requirements for admission <b>also</b> <b>differ</b> depending on the program. In 2011, the secondary school average for incoming first-year undergraduate students was 85 percent.|$|E

5|$|NAD and NADH <b>also</b> <b>differ</b> {{in their}} fluorescence. NADH in {{solution}} has an emission peak at 460nm and a fluorescence lifetime of 0.4nanoseconds, while the oxidized {{form of the}} coenzyme does not fluoresce. The properties of the fluorescence signal changes when NADH binds to proteins, so these changes {{can be used to}} measure dissociation constants, which are useful in the study of enzyme kinetics. These changes in fluorescence are also used to measure changes in the redox state of living cells, through fluorescence microscopy.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} very similar to A.barbiger. There are obvious {{differences}} in typical leaf shape, with leaves of most populations of A.barbiger being very much longer and narrower than those of A.obovatus. However, leaf shape is variable in both species, and some southern populations of A.barbiger have leaves that are indistinguishable from those of A.obovatus. The most systematically important properties by which the two may be distinguished are the shape of the perianth limb, which is rounded in A.obovatus and pointed in A.barbiger; the bracts, glabrous versus hirsute; and the style-ends, which are green and scarlet respectively. The species <b>also</b> <b>differ</b> slightly in range of flower colours: A.barbiger has scarlet to bright red flowers, whereas A.obovatus flowers are scarlet to orange.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{agreement}} {{as to the}} order in which the murders took place. Burke made two confessions but gave different sequences for the murders in each statement. The first was an official one, given on 3 January 1829 to the sheriff-substitute, the procurator fiscal and the assistant sheriff-clerk. The second was {{in the form of an}} interview with the Edinburgh Courant that was published on 7 February 1829. These in turn differed from the order given in Hare's statement, although the pair were agreed on many of the points of the murders. Contemporary reports <b>also</b> <b>differ</b> from the confessions of the two men. More recent sources, including the accounts written by Brian Bailey, Lisa Rosner and Owen Dudley Edwards, either follow one of the historic versions or present their own order of events.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difference}} between older and newer studies {{is that the}} type of patients treated with the ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies <b>also</b> <b>differ</b> because the treatment protocol has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged fast, designed to lose 5–10% body weight, and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions. Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.|$|E
5|$|General panic now {{seized the}} Allied army and it {{abandoned}} {{the field in}} all possible directions. A famous episode occurred during this retreat: Russian forces that had been defeated by the French right withdrew south towards Vienna via the Satschan frozen ponds. French artillery pounded towards the men, and the ice was broken due to the bombardment. The men drowned in the cold ponds, dozens of Russian artillery pieces going down with them. Estimates of how many guns were captured differ: {{there may have been}} as few as 38 or more than 100. Sources <b>also</b> <b>differ</b> about casualties, with figures ranging between 200 and 2,000 dead. Many drowning Russians were saved by their victorious foes. However, local evidence, only later made public, suggests that Napoleon's account of the catastrophe may have been totally invented; on his instructions the lakes were drained {{a few days after the}} battle and the corpses of only two or three men, with some 150 horses, were found.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the conquest are narrated by two sources, the various {{versions}} of the Chronicle of the Morea, and On the Conquest of Constantinople, by the Crusader Geoffrey of Villehardouin (uncle of Geoffrey I). According to the Chronicle, the Franks had between 700 men, while the Greeks had 4,000, mounted and on foot. The elder Villehardouin states that the army of Michael (who is not mentioned by the Chronicle) numbered 5,000 men {{and that of the}} Franks 500. The two sources <b>also</b> <b>differ</b> in the exact chronology of events, with the Chronicle placing the battle after the Frankish capture of Kalamata, and the elder Villehardouin after the seizure of Modon. In any case, despite being outnumbered, the Franks, after a march of a single day, confronted the Greeks and won the battle, no details for which are given.|$|E
