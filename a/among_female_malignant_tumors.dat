30|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most common {{malignancy}} and the leading cause of cancer death <b>among</b> <b>females</b> worldwide, accounting for ~ 36 % of <b>female</b> primary <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> (Jemal et al., 2011). Although advances in diagnosis such as regular mammography and appropriately systemic treatments have improved the prognosis (DeSantis et al., 2014), distant metastases usually occur several years after the primary breast cancer, causing approximately 90 % of breast cancer mortality (Bendre et al., 2003). Considering that the precise mechanisms of breast cancer metastasis remain largely unknown, additional investigation is necessary to clarify the progression of this phenomenon.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{show the}} {{radiological}} manifestations of primary pleural tumors. Patients and methods: we {{carried out a}} retrospective analysis of radiological findings in 62 patients with primary <b>malignant</b> <b>tumor</b> of pleura. Results: Study included 39 male and 23 <b>female</b> patients. <b>Malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> were present in 92. 7 % of the patients and benign ones in 7. 2 %. The most common <b>malignant</b> <b>tumor</b> was mesothelioma (85. 4 %), and solitary fibrous tumor prevailed among benign tumors (9. 7 %). Diffuse malignant mesothelioma manifested on computed tomography (CT) as a pleural thickening and effusion in 67. 4 % of the patients, tumors and effusion in 11. 7 %, and only as an effusion in 9. 8 % cases. Thickening of the pleura appeared diffuse in 54 % of patients and most often it had nodular pattern. Both localized malignant and all benign tumors presented as tumor-like changes with the signs of necrosis in 50 %. Conclusion: The imaging methods have {{a key role in}} the diagnosis of pleural tumors. CT shows different morphologic features of pleural lesions that have been established as a useful tool for differentiating malignant from benign disease. However, magnetic resonance is preferred imaging method for assessing the extent and resectability of pleural tumors...|$|R
40|$|Breast cancer (BC) is {{the most}} common <b>female</b> <b>malignant</b> <b>tumor.</b> Previous studies have {{suggested}} a big incidence disparity among different cities in China. The present work selected a typical city, Hangzhou, to study BC incidence disparity within the city. Totally, 8784 female breast cancer cases were obtained from the Hangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention during the period 2008 - 2012. Analysis of Variance and Poisson Regression were the statistical tools implemented to compare incidence disparity in the space-time domain (reference group: township residents during 2008, area: subdistrict, town, and township, time frame: 2008 - 2012), space-time scan statistics was employed to detect significant spatiotemporal clusters of BC compared to the null hypothesis that the probability of cases diagnosed at a particular location was equal to the probability of cases diagnosed in the whole study area. Geographical Information System (GIS) was used to generate BC spatial distribution and cluster maps at the township level. The subdistrict populations were found to have the highest and most stable BC incidence. Although town and township populations had a relatively low incidence, it displayed a significant increasing trend from 2008 to 2012. The BC incidence distribution was spatially heterogeneous and clustered with a trend-surface from the southwest low area to the northeast high area. High clusters were located in the northeastern Hangzhou area, whereas low clusters were observed in the southwestern area during the time considered. Better healthcare service and lifestyle changes may be responsible for the increasing BC incidence observed in towns and townships. One high incidence cluster (Linping subdistrict) and two low incidence clusters (middle Hangzhou) were detected. The low clusters may be attributable mainly to developmental level disparity, whereas the high cluster could be associated with other risk factors, such as environmental pollution...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} rate {{of breast cancer}} has been dramatically increasing since the last decade in Iran, {{and it is now}} one of the most common <b>female</b> <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors.</b> B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL 2) family is the most important regulator of apoptosis, and − 938 C>A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of BCL 2 gene promoter has been demonstrated to influence breast cancer susceptibility. In this research, we study the effect of − 938 C>A allelic variants on breast cancer risk in Mazandaran province at the North of Iran. Materials and Methods: This analysis performed on 120 breast cancer patients who underwent surgery in some referenced hospitals at Mazandaran province along with 130 healthy individuals as a control. DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples was applied in polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis to determine − 938 C>A genotype. The association of the − 938 C>A genotype and breast cancer risk as well as clinicopathological characters were analyzed by logistic regression method. Results: Results showed that genotype frequency of AA, AC, and CC genotypes was 10 %, 62 %, and 28 % for case and 28 %, 50 %, and 22 % in control group, respectively. In the logistic regression model, BCL 2 − 938 C/A variant genotype AA was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer (P = 0. 041) by 0. 31 -fold (odds ratio = 0. 31, confidence interval = 0. 091 – 0. 909) compared to CC genotype. However, no significant association found between − 938 C>A genotype and clinicopathological characters. Conclusion: The study showed that AA genotype of BCL 2 gene (− 938 C>A) is associated with decreased susceptibility to breast cancer. Hence, investigating the − 938 C>A SNP of BCL 2 gene promoter could be an appropriate molecular marker to determine individual sensitivity to breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{chest wall}} tumor is rare but it {{encompasses}} tumors of various origins. We analyzed our experience with primary chest wall tumors {{with emphasis on}} its demographic presentation and management. Methods: From 1991 to 2004, 62 patients with the diagnosis of primary chest wall tumors were enrolled. Lipoma, chest wall metastasis, direct invasion from nearby malignancy, infection, and inflammation of chest wall were excluded. The clinical features, management, and the outcome of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. Results: There were 37 males and 25 <b>females.</b> <b>Malignant</b> and benign <b>tumors</b> were equally distributed. Chondrosarcoma and lymphoma were the 2 most common types of <b>malignant</b> chest wall <b>tumors.</b> The most common clinical symptoms were palpable mass (54. 8 %) and pain (40. 3 %). Nine of 31 patients (29. 0 %) with benign chest wall tumors were free of symptoms whereas patients with <b>malignant</b> chest wall <b>tumors</b> were all symptomatic (p = 0. 002). A definite diagnosis was obtained in 21 of 26 patients (80. 7 %) who received nonexcision biopsy. All patients with primary chest wall tumors, except 6 who had medical treatment only, underwent surgical resection. Patients with <b>malignant</b> chest wall <b>tumors</b> were older than those with benign tumors (p < 0. 001). The mean largest diameter of tumors was also larger in <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> than in benign tumors (p = 0. 04). Conclusion: Patients with primary malignant chest wall neoplasm were older than those with benign tumors. The mean size of <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> was larger than that of benign tumors. Adequate surgical resection remains the treatment of choice for patients with primary chest wall tumors. Nonexcision biopsy should be reserved for patients with a past history of malignancy, suspicion of hematologic disease, and with high operative risk. For patients with isolated chest wall lym-phoma, surgical resection followed by chemotherapy can be considered to obtain a better outcome...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the results for the insertion of totally implantable central venous access de-vices (TICVADs) by surgeons. Methods: Total 397 patients, in whom TICVADs had been inserted for intravenous chemotherapy between September 2008 and June 2014, were pooled. This procedure was performed under local anesthesia in an operation room. The insertion site for the TICVAD was mainly in the right-side subclavian vein. In the case of breast cancer patients, the subclavian vein op-posite the surgical site was used for insertion. Results: The 397 patients included 73 males and 324 <b>females.</b> Primary <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> were mainly colorectal and breast cancer. The mean operation time was 54 minutes (18 – 276 minutes). Operation-related complications occurred in 33 cases (8. 3 %). Early complications developed in 15 cases with catheter malposition and puncture failure. Late complications, which developed after 24 hours, included inflammation in 6 cases, skin necrosis in 6 cases, hematoma in 3 cases, port mal-function in 1 case, port migration in 1 case, and intractable pain at the port site in 1 case. Conclusion: Insertion of a TICVAD under local anesthesia by a surgeon is a relatively safe procedure. Meticulous under-mining of the skin and carefully managing the TICVAD could minimize complications...|$|R

According to IARC among male population the most common incidence rates range from 1 to 2 cases per 100. 000 and <b>among</b> <b>female</b> population – from 0. 5 to 1. 0 among women.  Purpose of study. To study dynamics {{of morbidity and mortality}} from <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> of bones, the quality of estimation, observed and relative survival of patients according to histological forms. The work of this level is held in Russia for the first time. Material and methods of study.

The basis of this work is data from the Population-based Cancer Registry of St. Petersburg and special studies being held before its establishing in 1993. Annually in St. Petersburg there are registered 40 – 60 primary cases of <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> of bones (S 40, 41). The level of morphological verification of these malignancies in Russia is 82. 1 %, in St. Petersburg – 84. 9 %. There is a high rate of undefined stage: in Russia – 19. 7 %, in St. Petersburg – 24. 5 %, in Moscow – 23. 5 %. During the first year of observation 27. 3 % of patients die in Russia, 21. 7 % in St. Petersburg, and 11. 1 % in Moscow.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors in classifying a tumor as benign or malignant is its invasive potential. If a tumor lacks the ability to invade adjacent tissues or spread to distant sites by metastasizing then it is benign, whereas invasive or metastatic tumours are malignant. For this reason, benign tumours are not classed as cancer. Benign tumors will grow in a contained area usually encapsulated in a fibrous connective tissue capsule. The growth rates of benign and <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> also differ; benign tumors generally grow more slowly than <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors.</b> Although benign tumors pose a lower health risk than <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors,</b> they both can be life-threatening in certain situations. There are many general characteristics which apply to either benign or <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors,</b> but sometimes one type may show characteristics of the other. For example, benign tumors are mostly well differentiated and <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> are often undifferentiated. However, undifferentiated benign <b>tumors</b> and differentiated <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> can occur. Although benign tumors generally grow slowly, cases of fast-growing benign tumors have also been documented. Some <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> are mostly non-metastatic such {{as in the case of}} basal cell carcinoma. CT and chest radiography can be a useful diagnostic exam in visualizing a benign tumour and differentiating it from a <b>malignant</b> <b>tumor.</b> The smaller the tumor on a radiograph the more likely it is to be benign as 80% of lung nodules less than 2 cm in diameter are benign. Most benign nodules are smoothed radiopaque densities with clear margins but these are not exclusive signs of benign tumors.|$|R

40|$|Limb salvage is {{now more}} common than {{amputation}} after radical excision to treat <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors.</b> In a skeletally immature patient who has <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> in a lower extremity, rotationplasty offers a more reliable and durable option than other limb salvage procedures. It is an excellent method of resolving the problem of unequal leg lengths, and preserves best limb function with few complications. Here, we present our experience with rotationplasty for limb salvage {{in the treatment of}} <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors,</b> with good functional results seen in follow-up examination 11 years after surgery...|$|R
40|$|People {{pay more}} and more {{attention}} to health {{with the development of}} society. In addition, owing to the uncertain pathological cause, {{more and more}} kinds of <b>malignant</b> <b>tumor</b> seriously affect our health. In order to reduce the economic loss and protect the safety of our life, it is necessary to forecast the occurrence of <b>malignant</b> <b>tumor</b> and make prevention countermeasures. Conventional grey model has usually been used for forecasting in disease prediction, but it has significant limitations. Improved grey forecasting model in <b>malignant</b> <b>tumor</b> is established based on interpolation optimization. The result of the analysis shows that the accuracy of improved grey model is significant higher than conventional model, so the improved grey model can be used for forecasting in <b>malignant</b> <b>tumor.</b> It can extend to other disease prediction...|$|R
40|$|<b>Malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> carry a {{high risk}} of death, and the {{prevention}} of <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors</b> is a crucial issue in preventive medicine. To this end, many chemopreventive agents have been tested, but the effects of single agents {{have been found to be}} insufficient to justify clinical trials. We have therefore hypothesized that combinations of different chemopreventive agents may synergistically enhance the preventive effect of chemopreventive agents used singly. To provide the treating physician with some guideline by which to choose the most effective agents to be combined, we propose a strategy which we have termed the “combination-oriented molecular-targeting prevention” of cancer. As the molecular target of our model, we focused on tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which specifically causes apoptosis in <b>malignant</b> <b>tumor</b> cells. Many of these agents were found to up-regulate the expression of death receptor 5, a TRAIL receptor. They were also found to synergistically induce apoptosis in <b>malignant</b> <b>tumor</b> cells when combined with TRAIL. Here, we strongly advocate that the strategy of “combination-oriented molecular-targeting prevention” of cancer will be a practical approach for chemoprevention against human <b>malignant</b> <b>tumors...</b>|$|R
