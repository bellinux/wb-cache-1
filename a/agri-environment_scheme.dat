40|$|<b>Agri-environment</b> <b>schemes</b> {{have been}} {{implemented}} across Europe to counter biodiversity loss in agricultural landscapes and halt the continual decline of farmland birds, including waders. Such schemes provide financial compensation for changes in agricultural practice, including livestock grazing regimes. Scheme uptake has been variable, partly because farmers believe that other factors, notably predation, are key to wader population declines. On the basis of wader breeding surveys across Shetland, UK, we show that predator density and livestock grazing, through reducing sward height, interact to influence territoriality and thereby are likely to affect wader breeding success. Our results appear to reflect views of both farmers and government agencies, which indicates that future <b>agri-environment</b> <b>schemes</b> would benefit from genuine stakeholder participation to maximize scheme uptake, implementation and beneficial effects on biodiversity.

40|$|The paper {{explored}} {{key factors}} {{that might lead}} to successful agri-environmental social learning and collective action in order to deliver landscape-scale resource management within <b>agri-environment</b> <b>schemes.</b> Using the theory of collective action as an analytical framework the paper examined findings from in-depth interviews with 20 members of two co-operative initiatives in Wales and two participatory workshops. Consideration of the theory helped in understanding how individuals come together to provide public goods, and the conditions that make this activity a success. Factors of importance for organising and delivering collective <b>agri-environment</b> <b>schemes</b> were: locally adaptable engagement strategies; working with group members previously known to each other; institutional arrangements that limited group size and which allowed groups to develop their own solutions and implementation rules; and external support offering the services of a local facilitator and funding for both planning and management stages.

40|$|Over {{the past}} century there have been {{substantial}} declines in farmland biodiversity {{as a result of}} the intensification of agricultural practice. Concerns over these declines have led to the development of <b>agri-environment</b> <b>schemes</b> designed to mitigate the effects of intensive agriculture and to benefit biodiversity. Prior to commencing this thesis it was not clear if flower-rich, pollinator-focused <b>agri-environment</b> <b>schemes</b> had a population level impact on wild bees on farmland. Whilst previous work has shown that the creation of flower-rich habitat can provide suitable foraging resources for bumblebees, little was known about the impact of this management on bumblebee population sizes and even less on whether these resources were used by and benefited solitary bees. This thesis compares bee populations between farms with and without flower-rich, pollinator focused <b>agri-environment</b> <b>schemes</b> in Hampshire and West Sussex, UK. Using genetic techniques to estimate colony density, and hence population size, farms implementing targeted schemes had a significantly higher density of bumblebee nests for the four species studied (212 nests/km 2 against 112 nests/km 2). However, there was no difference in the species richness of bees between these different farm types. When assessing pollen use by solitary bees, flowering plants sown as part of pollinator-focused <b>agri-environment</b> <b>schemes</b> were not widely used, representing 27 % of pollen foraging observations and 23 % of pollen collected by volume. Only 35 % of solitary bee species were found to use sown plants for pollen to a meaningful extent, with most pollen collected from plants persisting in the wider environment. The creation of flower-rich habitat significantly increased resource availability, but did not increase resource diversity. These results indicate that if diverse bee populations are to be maintained on farmland then <b>agri-environment</b> <b>schemes</b> must be developed that effectively increase the number of flowering plant species present at the farm scale...|$|R
40|$|<b>Agri-environment</b> <b>schemes</b> are an {{instrument}} used by western European countries {{to counteract the}} negative effects of contemporary agriculture on biodiversity, but not much is known about their effectiveness. We investigated the ecological effects of Dutch <b>agri-environment</b> <b>schemes</b> aimed at promoting botanical diversity or meadow birds, and we tested whether the effectiveness of the schemes depends on landscape type or structure. In three different types of landscape, we surveyed plants, birds, bees, and hover flies on 78 paired fields that either had <b>agri-environment</b> <b>schemes</b> or were managed conventionally, and we collected data on a range of different environmental variables. Neither plant species richness nor abundance of meadow birds was higher on fields with <b>agri-environment</b> <b>schemes.</b> Landscape type had a significant effect on both species groups, but the effects of the schemes were independent of landscape type. Neither the diversity of plants nor the abundance of birds was related to any of the environmental variables. <b>Agri-environment</b> <b>schemes</b> designed to promote plant species richness or bird abundance did have positive side-effects because they enhanced the species richness of bees and hover flies, irrespective of the type of landscape. Furthermore, landscape type, groundwater level (hover flies), and area of wooded edges (bees) significantly affected both species groups. The failure of the schemes to promote the target species {{may be related to the}} high intensity of land use in The Netherlands. Simple conservation measures taken by farmers may not be sufficient to counteract the impact of factors that are often controlled at the landscape level (e. g., hydrology).

40|$|Agricultural {{intensification}} {{has contributed}} to severe declines in odonate (dragonfly and damselfly) populations. Odonates require healthy waterbodies for their larval stages and resource-rich terrestrial landscapes as adults. As such, farmland management at both local and larger landscape scales {{may be needed to}} reverse population declines. We sampled odonate adults and exuviae from lowland farmland ponds in England, to investigate relationships between odonate species richness and surrounding land-use. The more mobile dragonflies (Anisoptera) were influenced most strongly by landscape variables at the largest scale (i. e. 1600 m radius), while less mobile damselflies (Zygoptera) were affected by variables at more local scales (i. e. 100 / 400 m radii). A greater number of landscape variables affected exuvial species richness compared to adult species richness. Exuvial species richness was higher when 2 m wide cross-compliance buffer strips around ponds were present. However, no ponds in the study had buffer strips that were established through England's basic <b>agri-environment</b> <b>scheme</b> (Entry Level Scheme: ELS) agreements, and we observed a negative relationship between ELS area and exuvial species richness. Exuvial species richness increased with the amount of water, but not the number of ponds, in the landscape surrounding a focal pond. The observed odonate responses to local and surrounding land-use lend support to the development of <b>agri-environment</b> <b>scheme</b> policies that encourage landscape-scale, as well as local, scheme implementation and management.

40|$|The recent {{dramatic}} {{decline in}} farmland biodiversity is often attributed to agricultural intensification and structural {{changes in the}} agricultural landscape. One suggested farm practice seen to benefit biodiversity and reverse declines is organic farming. Because organic farming {{is viewed as a}} more sustainable form of agriculture it is currently subsidized by European <b>agri-environment</b> <b>schemes.</b> However, the efficiency of <b>agri-environment</b> <b>schemes</b> to preserve biodiversity has recently been questioned, partly because their uptake has been highest in extensively farmed more heterogeneous landscapes. We investigated the effect of farming practice on butterfly species richness and abundance along cereal field headlands and margins on 12 matched pairs of organic and conventional farms in contrasting landscapes (homogeneous and heterogeneous landscape diversity). Both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity significantly increased butterfly species richness and abundance. There was also a significant interaction between farming practice and landscape heterogeneity, because organic farming only significantly increased butterfly species richness and abundance in homogeneous rather than heterogeneous landscapes. An analysis of the distribution of organic farming in Sweden in relation to productivity of the arable land (yield of spring barley, kg ha(- 1)) indicated that the distribution of organic farms was skewed towards extensively farmed agricultural areas. Synthesis and applications. The species richness and abundance of butterflies can be enhanced by actions aimed at both promoting organic farming and increasing landscape heterogeneity. However, the beneficial effect of organic farming was only evident in intensively farmed homogeneous landscapes. Currently, the majority of organic arable land in Sweden is located in heterogeneous landscapes where changing the type of farming practice adds little to the existing biodiversity. We therefore propose that the interaction between landscape heterogeneity and farming practice must be considered when promoting farmland biodiversity, for example in Europe by developing context-based <b>agri-environment</b> <b>schemes</b> {{to increase the amount of}} organic farming in intensively farmed landscapes. We also propose that in homogeneous agricultural landscapes, organic farming could be used as a more efficient tool to restore landscape heterogeneity if the creation of semi-natural landscape elements was mandatory in the regulations associated with organic <b>agri-environment</b> <b>schemes...</b>|$|R

We analyse case studies of two new approaches: an area approach with group contracts and spatial coordination of agri-environmental measures, and a farming system with substantial adaptations of the farming concept.
