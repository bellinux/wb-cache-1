5|$|A {{photograph}} of the building that was to house the theater appeared in The Morning Oregonian newspaper in 1913. Known as the Kleist Building after its owner, Edward Kleist, it had a pressed brick front and walls with hollow tiles. The second floor was intended for residential rooms and apartments, and the ground floor was designed for business storerooms and a movie theater. According to a February 1915 newspaper advertisement, The Exploits of Elaine, the first in <b>a</b> <b>continuing</b> series of Craig Kennedy detective stories, was to show at The Clinton on March 1.|$|E
5|$|After a brief postwar increase, Troy's {{population}} began <b>a</b> <b>continuing</b> decline.

Those plans called for the demolition of many buildings downtown, {{to be replaced by a}} new arterial road, large public housing projects and a shopping mall. After various delays, those projects were either scaled back or abandoned entirely. In the interim many businesses either closed or moved out of downtown.|$|E

5|$|As the Royalist {{situation}} deteriorated, the south-west {{became one}} of the few remaining Royalist strongholds. Lingen, with 200men and 90horses at Goodrich Castle, conducted raids on Parliamentary forces in the region, representing <b>a</b> <b>continuing</b> challenge. No action had been taken, however, to strengthen the castle's defences with more modern 17th-century earthworks, and the castle remained essentially in its medieval condition.|$|E

Although Bulleid built two prototype electric locomotives in 1941, these were, as yet, unproven, and freight haulage would be undertaken by steam traction for the foreseeable future.|$|E
