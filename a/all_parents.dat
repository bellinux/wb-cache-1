25|$|By contrast, {{the cases}} in which the Court had allowed a {{religious}} motivation to exempt a person from a neutral, generally applicable law involved the assertion of both the right of free exercise along with some other right. Thus, religious publishers are exempt from a law requiring them to obtain a license if that license may be denied to any publisher the government deems nonreligious. The government may not tax religious solicitors. The government may not require the Amish {{to send their children to}} school because their religion demands otherwise, and Amish parents, like <b>all</b> <b>parents,</b> have the right to direct the education of their children. Because Smith and Black were not asserting a hybrid right, they could not claim a religious exemption under the First Amendment from Oregon's ban on peyote.|$|E
25|$|An Act of January 1984 {{asserted}} a {{right for}} <b>all</b> <b>parents</b> {{to benefit from}} a parental leave of absence for childrearing, providing that they have one year’s seniority. This legislation also allowed parents (under the same conditions) to request part-time work and to shift freely between part-time work and parental leave. In 1982, the law governing the age of consent for homosexual activity was reduced from 18 to 15 years to match the age of consent for heterosexual activity. For those with disabilities, a 1982 law on urban transport reform stated that special measures {{must be taken to}} accommodate the special needs of people with limited mobility. A law passed on 9 July 1984 provided that a worker with at least two years' service must receive a redundancy payment based on gross earnings prior to termination of the work contract. The law further provided that workers aged 60 or above who voluntarily left the firm would receive a retirement severance grant.|$|E
25|$|As prime minister, David Cameron {{wanted to}} put family policy {{at the heart of}} the Conservative Party {{claiming}} British politics in the past had got it wrong. He stated families should be the most important thing in the country's life, believing social responsibility and a strong family was key to an individuals success, and by extent becoming less reliant on the state. Both Cameron and Theresa May have aimed at helping families achieve a work-home balance and have previously proposed to offer <b>all</b> <b>parents</b> 12 months parental leave, to be shared by mother and father as they choose. Other policies have included doubling the free hours of childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds from 15 hours to 30 hours a week during term-time, and fund 15 hours a week of free childcare for all disadvantaged two-year-olds, worth £2,500 a year per child. Tax schemes to support families, freezing fuel duty, cutting income tax. David Cameron in a speech mentioned businesses will have to help cut the costs imposed on society and families through the decisions businesses make, by becoming more socially responsible which would in turn reduce the need for state control to solve the problem.|$|E

Going against legitimacy is Haram (forbidden). This is an invitation for chaos. We support stability. What we have now is a blind chaos leading to a civil war. I call on <b>all</b> <b>parents</b> to ask their children to stay home." [...] A former general who was a part of the intelligence services said that Mubarak would have no qualms about [...] "setting the whole country on fire." [...] Western media suggested the possibility of civil war as violence between the two sides escalated, leaving over a thousand injured.|$|E
500|$|Sometimes {{events are}} not {{associated}} with a specific physical time. [...] Provided that pairs of events have a purely causal relationship, that is edges represent causal relations between the events, {{we will have a}} directed acyclic graph. For instance, a Bayesian network represents a system of probabilistic events as vertices in a directed acyclic graph, in which the likelihood of an event may be calculated from the likelihoods of its predecessors in the DAG. In this context, the moral graph of a DAG is the undirected graph created by adding an (undirected) edge between <b>all</b> <b>parents</b> of the same vertex (sometimes called marrying), and then replacing all directed edges by undirected edges. Another type of graph with a similar causal structure is an influence diagram, the vertices of which represent either decisions to be made or unknown information, and the edges of which represent causal influences from one vertex to another. In epidemiology, for instance, these diagrams are often used to estimate the expected value of different choices for intervention.|$|E

Thousands of people were crammed into the small old fortress, with only two water taps, almost no {{sanitary}} facilities, and no food. Many people were naturally anxious to leave. [...] A column of 2,000 people was quickly formed up, and marched out under the guard of Latvian auxiliary police.

Speaking to The Orlando Sentinel, Duckett's grandfather Bill Eubank said, [...] "Nancy Grace and the others, they just bashed her to the end. She was not one anyone ever {{would have thought of}} to do something like this." [...] CNN has also been criticized for allowing the show to air in the wake of Duckett's suicide. Police investigating the case had not named Melinda Duckett as a suspect in the case at the time, but after her suicide the police did say that, as nearly <b>all</b> <b>parents</b> are in missing-child cases, she was a suspect from the beginning.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{opponents of}} LGBT social {{movements}} have attributed their indifference toward homosexuality {{as being a}} result of the immoral values that it may instill in children who are exposed to homosexual individuals. In opposition to this claim, many proponents of increased education about homosexuality suggest that educators should refrain from teaching about sexuality in schools entirely. In her book entitled [...] "Gay and Lesbian Movement," [...] Margaret Cruickshank provides statistical data from the Harris and Yankelovich polls which confirmed that over 80% of American adults believe that students should be educated about sexuality within their public school. In addition, the poll also found that 75% of parents believe that homosexuality and abortion {{should be included in the}} curriculum as well. An assessment conducted on California public school systems discovered that only 2% of <b>all</b> <b>parents</b> actually disapproved of their child being taught about sexuality in school.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2006 budget, the Tories {{introduced}} a new child care allowance that gives parents with children under six years of age an allowance of $1200 per year, which is taxable {{in the hands of}} the lower income parent. The allowance is not tied to actual child care expenses, and is available to <b>all</b> <b>parents,</b> regardless of whether or not they use childcare services. The measures have cost the government about $3.7 billion per year. This plan replaced the Liberal government's plan announced in the [...] under Paul Martin who committed $5 billion over five years to enhance and expand early learning and child care in collaboration with provinces and territories. After March 2007, the newly elected Conservatives under Stephen Harper eliminated the bilateral agreements as their first act of power. The child care plan agreements were based on Quebec's universal child care model and had been signed under Paul Martin's Liberal government with several provinces in 2005. [...] The plan was cancelled when they took office and was replaced by the Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB) $100-a-month cheques for parents with young children with promised tax credits for private or profit care and up to $250 million annually to create child care spaces across the country.|$|E
