5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Friedrich was rediscovered by the Norwegian art {{historian}} Andreas Aubert (1851–1913), whose writing initiated modern Friedrich scholarship, and by the Symbolist painters, who valued his visionary and allegorical landscapes. The Norwegian Symbolist Edvard Munch (1863–1944) would have seen Friedrich's work during a visit to Berlin in the 1880s. Munch's 1899 print The Lonely Ones echoes Friedrich's Rückenfigur (back figure), although in Munch's work the focus has shifted away from the broad landscape <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> the sense of dislocation between the two melancholy figures in the foreground.|$|E
5|$|In 1900 {{a massive}} {{hurricane}} struck Galveston, destroying {{much of the}} city.

Because of these events, the coming oil boom became heavily centered on the city of Houston both as a port and a commercial center.|$|E

5|$|The Flavians, {{although}} a relatively short-lived dynasty, helped restore stability to an empire on its knees. Although all three have been criticised, especially {{based on their}} more centralised style of rule, they issued reforms that created a stable enough empire to last well into the 3rd century. However, their background as a military dynasty led to further marginalisation of the senate, and a conclusive move away from princeps, or first citizen, <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> imperator, or emperor.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Barton Fink is {{loosely based on}} Clifford Odets, a playwright from New York who in the 1930s joined the Group Theatre, a gathering of dramatists which included Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford, and Lee Strasberg. Their work emphasized social issues and employed Stanislavski's system of acting to recreate human experience as truthfully as possible. Several of Odets' plays were successfully performed on Broadway, including Awake and Sing! and Waiting for Lefty (both in 1935). When public tastes turned away from politically engaged theatre <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> the familial realism of Eugene O'Neill, Odets had difficulty producing successful work, so he moved to Hollywood and spent 20 years writing film scripts.|$|E

5|$|The {{design for}} the Partenope class was {{prepared}} by Engineering Inspector Carlo Vigna, and {{was based on the}} earlier torpedo cruiser , the first modern vessel of the type built by Italy. The development of torpedo cruisers in Italy in the mid-1880s represented a shift away from the emphasis on large capital ships that had been built for the previous decade <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> the ideas of the Jeune École, which emphasized small, fast, torpedo-armed vessels that could damage or destroy the much larger battleships {{at a fraction of the}} cost. The Partenope class were followed by the , the last class of torpedo cruisers built by Italy.|$|E

The fourth Austrian column, the smallest (three battalions and four squadrons), under General Wolff, marched {{the length of the}} Bodensee’s northern shore, via Überlingen, Meersburg, Buchhorn, and the Austrian city of Bregenz.|$|E
5|$|After {{transitioning}} into a post-tropical cyclone, Katia {{moved quickly}} across the North Atlantic <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> Europe, prompting the Met Office to begin warnings citizens for potential impacts over subsequent days on September9. Three days later, the organization raised a yellow severe weather alert {{for all of}} Ireland {{and most of the}} United Kingdom, with a more severe amber alert hoisted across Northern Ireland, the northernmost United Kingdom, and southern Scotland; both alerts warned of the potential for gale-force winds. Concurrently, Met Éireann outlined an extreme weather warning across Ireland, alerting residents to the potential for 130km/h (80mph) winds, downed trees, damaged buildings, and flooding. Irish ferries cancelled a number of its sails between Dublin and Holyhead. The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute warned of gale-force winds along the coastline of Sweden, although a brunt of the rainfall was expected in neighboring Norway.|$|E

5|$|By early 1934, {{the focus}} {{shifted away from}} funding work {{creation}} schemes <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> rearmament. By 1935, military expenditures accounted for 73 percent of the government's purchases of goods and services. On 18 October 1936, Hitler named Göring as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, intended {{to speed up the}} rearmament programme. In addition to calling for the rapid construction of steel mills, synthetic rubber plants and other factories, Göring instituted wage and price controls and restricted the issuance of stock dividends. Large expenditures were made on rearmament in spite of growing deficits. With the introduction of compulsory military service in 1935, the Reichswehr, which had been limited to 100,000 by the terms of the Versailles Treaty, expanded to 750,000 on active service at the start of World War II, with a million more in the reserve. By January 1939, unemployment was down to 301,800 and it dropped to only 77,500 by September.|$|E
5|$|By gaining {{power through}} {{a vote of}} {{confidence}} from the people and then willingly surrendering power, Selvo, like many other Doges who underwent similar transitions, left a long-term impact on the succession process that would eventually become a model for peaceful, anti-nepotistic transitions of power in a classical republic. Although his deposition did not immediately change the system, it was one of many important changes of power in a society that {{was in the process of}} moving away from a monarchy <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> a government led by an elected official. Following the battles at Corfu, Selvo was seen by many as inept and incapable of handling the duties that a Doge must perform. His apparent squandering of nearly the entire fleet coupled with a decade-long distrust for his royal wife caused Selvo to become unpopular in Venice. By responding to the will of the people, Selvo helped shape a society that would eventually create a complicated system to check the power of its most influential members, create cooperative governmental branches that checked each other's power, and fuse the nation into a classical republic.|$|E

5|$|Characteristic of Marko was his reverence {{and love}} for his mother, Jevrosima; he often sought her advice, {{following}} it even when it contradicted his own desires. She lived with Marko at his mansion in Prilep, his lodestar guiding him away from evil <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> good {{on the path of}} moral improvement and Christian virtues. Marko's honesty and moral courage are noteworthy in a poem in which he was the only person who knew the will of the late Tsar Dušan regarding his heir. Marko refused to lie in favour of the pretenders—his father and uncles. He said truthfully that Dušan appointed his son, Uroš, heir to the Serbian throne. This almost cost him his life, since Vukašin tried to kill him.|$|E
5|$|Hensley {{was arrested}} in Tennessee on moonshine-related charges during the Prohibition era and sentenced to a term in a workhouse, from which he escaped and fled the state. Hensley {{traveled}} to Ohio, where he held revival services, though {{he and his family}} rarely stayed long in one location. He established churches, known as the Church of God with Signs Following, in Tennessee and Kentucky. His services ranged from small meetings held in houses to large gatherings that drew media attention and hundreds of attendees. Although he conducted many services, he made little money, and he was arrested for violating laws against snake handling at least twice. During his ministry, Hensley claimed to have been bitten by many snakes without ill effect, <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> the end of his career, he estimated that he had survived more than 400bites. In 1955, while conducting a service in Florida, he was bitten by a snake and became violently ill. He refused to seek medical attention and died the following day. Despite his personal failings, he convinced many residents of rural Appalachia that snake handling was commanded by God, and his followers continued the practice after his death. Although snake handling developed independently in several Pentecostal ministries, Hensley is generally credited with spreading the custom in the Southeastern United States.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E
5|$|Mills's and Cleveland's defeat on the tariff {{bill could}} be {{considered}} a victory for Randall, but the vote showed how isolated the former Speaker's protectionist ideas now made him in his party: only four Democrats voted against the tariff reductions. The state party likewise turned against Randall <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> free trade, adopting a pro-tariff revision platform at the 1888 state Democratic convention. At the same time, Randall seemingly reversed his long-standing commitment to fiscal economy by voting with the Republicans to override Cleveland's veto of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act. The Act would have given a pension to every Union veteran (or their widows) who claimed he could no longer perform physical labor, regardless of whether his disability was war-related. Cleveland's veto was in line with his record of small-government cost-cutting, with which Randall would normally have sympathized. Randall, perhaps in an effort to gain favor with veterans in his district, joined the Republicans in an unsuccessful attempt to override Cleveland's veto. Another possibility proposed by biographer House is that Randall saw the federal budget surplus as reason to cut tariffs; by increasing federal spending, he hoped to decrease the surplus and maintain the need for high tariffs. Whatever the reason, the attempt failed and left Randall further alienated from his fellow Democrats.|$|E
5|$|On October27, the Yemen {{government}} requested {{assistance from}} the international community, unable to provide disaster assessments or cope with the rebuilding. The storm affected areas of Yemen that already had poor infrastructure and lack of food, and were generally under a state of political unrest, which made recovery difficult. In some areas, relief distribution was duplicated {{due to lack of}} coordination while some areas did not receive help. Yemen's Deputy Prime Minister for Internal Affairs coordinated the relief efforts, in conjunction with the governors of the most affected areas. The government focused on streamlining disaster activities <b>and</b> <b>toward</b> future mitigation. However, there was no coordinated disaster plan as of September 2009, and the scale of the disaster proved too great for ministries to handle. The Ministry of Public Works helped reopen roads, which allowed for the transport of relief goods, and the damaged Sayun Airport was repaired to withstand future floods. By December 2008, most roads, power systems, hospitals, and communication services were restored. The government also enacted the Fund for Hadramout and Al-Mahara Reconstruction, which failed to promptly distribute aid assistance.|$|E
