40|$|Pro forma is {{originated}} from Latin. It contains different meaning {{depends on which}} discipline it is used. In accounting, pro forma disclosure is used to show effect of important transaction which occurs {{after the end of}} periods, or which occurs during period but not fully reflected in historical cost financial statement of a firm. Pro forma disclosure has the objective to support (but might mislead) investor in decision making focused on particular influence of important transaction. Company with low GAAP profit information; less profitable company and has higher level of debt but more liquid, whose P-E ratio and market to book is higher than other companies in the industry; has the tendency to do pro forma disclosure. Pro forma disclosure has been supported by several theories such as: efficient market theory, catering theory, agency theory, signaling theory, and stakeholder theory. However, there are problems in reporting pro forma figures. There is no standard to it. Therefore, information on pro forma disclosure might <b>also</b> mislead <b>less</b> <b>sophisticated</b> investor...|$|R
40|$|Objective. The {{development}} of auditory receptive skills and spoken language is often delayed {{in children who}} use cochlear implants, which may affect their appreciation of and responses to music. This in turn may be interpreted as disinterest in music. A questionnaire was developed to determine whether differences in exposure and responses to music exist between young cochlear implant recipients and their normally hearing peers. Design. The questionnaire was developed by a multidisciplinary team and distributed to parents of preschool children with normal hearing and to parents of preschool {{children who had been}} implanted at least one year prior. Study sample. The cochlear implant group comprised 23 children and was gender and age matched (within ± 2 months) to a group of children with normal hearing. Results & Conclusions. Young cochlear implant recipients receive similar exposure to audiovisual music media, parental singing and musical instruments at home. However, the data suggest that they receive less exposure to children's music presented without visual stimuli. Parents <b>also</b> reported <b>less</b> <b>sophisticated</b> responses to music for this group. The findings of this study have important implications concerning the provision of age-appropriate music habilitation materials and activities for young cochlear implant recipients. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Here we {{investigate}} an exemplary chemodynamical evolutionary simulation of a dwarf irregular galaxy. By means {{of this model}} we demonstrate the existence of three gas mixing cycles: 1) An inner "local cycle" mixing the metals produced in stars locally, and 2) an outer "galactic cycle" on which hot gas is driven out of the galaxy by multiple supernovae type II and mixes on a short timescale with the available cold gas. 3) Only {{a small fraction of}} the metals leaves the galactic gravitational field and follows the "global cycle" with the intergalactic matter. The large-scale mixing results in a temporary depletion of supernova ejected metals. We will discuss this "delayed recycling" and its influence on the chemical evolution, especially on the nitrogen over oxygen ratio which is increased temporarily. These results presented her are <b>also</b> relevant for <b>less</b> <b>sophisticated</b> analytical approaches and chemical evolutionary models of galaxies which have to parameterize the metal loss through outflow.

5000|$|Film critic Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{wrote in}} his review: [...] "OUT of the {{memories}} of his boyhood in Waxahachie, Tex., during the Great Depression, and within the unlikely tradition of the old-fashioned mortgage melodrama, Robert Benton has made {{one of the best}} films in years about growing up American. Its title is Places in the Heart, which is misleading in its sentimentality, for the film itself, though full of sentiment, demonstrates in every other way the writer-director's built- in junk-detector. ... Places in the Heart is the moving and often funny story of how Edna Spaulding, through hard work, grit and a certain amount of luck, manages to see things through. Edna, as beautifully played by Miss Field, has a lot of the steadfastness that distinguished the actress's Oscar-winning performance in Norma Rae. However, Edna is <b>also</b> a much <b>less</b> <b>sophisticated</b> personality, whose growth, {{in the course of the}} film, reflects an almost 19th-century faith in the possibilities of the American system, not as the system was, but as one wanted to believe it to be. ... Places in the Heart is a tonic, a revivifying experience right down to the final images, which, like those at the end of Luis Bunuel's Tristana, carry us back to the very beginning of the cycle of these particular lives." ...|$|R
