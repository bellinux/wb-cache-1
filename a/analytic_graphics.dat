Additionally, over 30 % of health plan members with complex health issues {{have at least one}} behavioral health issue driving cost risk. This paper looks at graphical representations of cost {{as part of an effort}} to develop an overall methodology for prediction of future cost risk from selected behavioral health issues. SAS provides a comprehensive set of graphics tools and procedures as part of the SAS/GRAPH product. Additionally, the SAS/STAT module provides an extensive library of tools for data analysis. Within SAS/STAT, the new ODS graphics applications add value to this ability by providing customizable statistical graphics that display automatically with these procedures when ODS graphics are invoked. This presentation combines the graphics available in SAS/GRAPH with ODS statistical graphics to explore behavioral health cost risk through examination of medical and pharmacy claims, demographics, and self-reported health readiness assessments (HRAs). The <b>analytic</b> <b>graphics</b> in this paper were developed with version 9. 1. 3 of SAS executing on a Windows XP platform. SAS Version 9. 1 is required for the ODS graphics extensions.

40|$|Geomatics is {{the science}} {{concerned}} with using mathematical methods with spatial data {{to learn about}} the earth's surface. Health geomatics is used to improve the understanding of relationships between people, location, time, and health. Geomaticists assist in discovering and eliminating disease, aid in public health disease prevention and health promotion initiatives, and support healthcare service planning and delivery through defining spatial relationships. Distance mapping is one of many tools in the geomatics toolbox that furthers this understanding. SAS ® provides a comprehensive set of graphics tools and procedures as part of the SAS/GRAPH ® product {{that can be used for}} distance mapping, including the new GEOCODE procedure and the GEODIST function, available with SAS 9. 2. This paper combines the graphics available in SAS/GRAPH with other available SAS tools to explore spatial relationships in the health care arena. Examples include maps, grid squares, area charts, and X-Y plots. The <b>analytic</b> <b>graphics</b> in this paper were developed with version 9. 1. 3 or 9. 2 of SAS executing on a Windows XP platform. SAS 9. 2 is required for the GEOCODE procedure.

The paper presents the maximum ionization distance, <b>analytic</b> and <b>graphic,</b> near discharge wires {{depending on the}} voltage supply frequency and the discharge wires radius. A problem {{of this type of}} precipitator is difficulty to collection high resistivity fly ash. In the inlet section the fly ash resistivity is moderate and is necessary to charge dust particles as many is possible. It is useful to use traditional dc energization. For the middle section and especially for outlet section, where the fly ash resistivity is high, it is necessary another supply solution for section because the charging particle decrease when is use traditional dc energization. The paper presents analysis of different types supplies of ESP sections. The intermitent energization of sections can be a cheap solution to middle and outlet section (without change the power supply structure, it is necessary the change of the automatic voltage control unit). It is important to know the current-voltage characteristics to obtain the optimal control of the amplitude, the voltage shape, the input power and the collection efficiency. With comparative analyze of the measured and computed characteristics, with different mathematical model of current-voltage characteristics, it can be found which models estimate the current-voltage characteristics for plate-type {{electrostatic precipitators}}. Key-Words: plate-type electrostatic precipitators, dc energization, intermitent energization, current-voltage characteristics, mathematical models...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to study communication processes in families where members are undergoing testing for genetic conditions because the information received from such testing is crucial {{not just to the}} individual concerned but also to other members of the biological family. This topic has received little research attention, {{in part because of the}} complexities of methodology required. In this paper we present the development of a method specifically designed for the examination of the content and process of communication of genetic information in families. The method aims to maximize ecological validity as far as is possible. We describe how participants and other family members are recruited and how data were collected. We outline three main data <b>analytic</b> strategies: a <b>graphic</b> to show how genetic information changes as it flows from clinic and through the family, an intensive qualitative analysis of the meaning and impact of the genetic information to different family members, and an informative genogram which plots key family dynamics.

40|$|Join {{optimization}} {{has been}} dominated by Selinger-style, pairwise optimizers for decades. But, Selinger-style algorithms are asymptotically suboptimal for applications in <b>graphic</b> <b>analytics.</b> This suboptimality {{is one of the reasons}} that many have advocated supplementing relational engines with specialized graph processing engines. Recently, new join algorithms have been discovered that achieve optimal worst-case run times for any join or even so-called beyond worst-case (or instance optimal) run time guarantees for specialized classes of joins. These new algorithms match or improve on those used in specialized graph-processing systems. This paper asks can these new join algorithms allow relational engines to close the performance gap with graph engines? We examine this question for graph-pattern queries or join queries. We find that classical relational databases like Postgres and MonetDB or newer graph databases/stores like Virtuoso and Neo 4 j may be orders of magnitude slower than these new approaches compared to a fully featured RDBMS, LogicBlox, using these new ideas. Our results demonstrate that an RDBMS with such new algorithms can perform as well as specialized engines like GraphLab [...] while retaining a high-level interface. We hope this adds to the ongoing debate of the role of graph accelerators, new graph systems, and relational systems in modern workloads...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOur {{society has}} entered a {{data-driven}} era, {{one in which}} not only are enormous amounts of data being generated daily {{but there are also}} growing expectations placed on the analysis of this data. Some data have become simply too large to be displayed and some have too short a lifespan to be handled properly with classical visualization or analysis methods. In order to address these issues, this book explores the potential solutions where we not only visualize data, but also allow users to be able to interact with it. Therefore, this book will focus on two main topics: large dataset visualization and interaction. Graphic cards and their image processing power can leverage large data visualization but they can also be of great interest to support interaction. Therefore, this book will show how to take advantage of graphic card computation power with techniques called GPGPUs (general-purpose computing on graphics processing units). As specific examples, this book details GPGPU usages to produce fast enough visualization to be interactive with improved brushing techniques, fast animations between different data representations, and view simplifications (i. e. static and dynamic bundling techniques). Since data storage and memory limitation is less and less of an issue, we will also present techniques to reduce computation time by using memory as a new tool to solve computationally challenging problems. We will investigate innovative data processing techniques: while classical algorithms are expressed in data space (e. g. computation on geographic locations), we will express them in graphic space (e. g., raster map like a screen composed of pixels). This consists of two steps: (1) a data representation is built using straightforward visualization techniques; and (2) the resulting image undergoes purely graphical transformations using image processing techniques. This type of technique is called image-based visualization. The goal of this book is to explore new computing techniques using image-based techniques to provide efficient visualizations and user interfaces for the exploration of large datasets. This book concentrates on the areas of information visualization, visual <b>analytics,</b> computer <b>graphics,</b> and human-computer interaction. This book opens up a whole field of study, including the scientific validation of these techniques, their limitations, and their generalizations to different types of dataset...|$|R
