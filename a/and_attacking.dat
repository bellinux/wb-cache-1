40|$|DOI: [URL]   The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze the {{association}} between variables of the game on the offensive structure from the zone in which attack is performed in high-level Men’s volleyball. The sample was composed by 12 teams, with the analysis of 142 games, which totalized 19, 545 reception, set <b>and</b> <b>attack</b> actions. Data analyses were run with descriptive statistic and the qui-quadratic test for searching association between the variables. The results showed association between tempo of <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>attack</b> effect, type of <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>attack</b> zone <b>and</b> <b>attack</b> zone <b>and</b> tempo of <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>attack</b> effect. It was concluded that Brazilian teams underuse backcourt <b>attacks,</b> <b>and</b> the offensive structure accomplished through the faster game, which is mainly important on attacks carried out in positions 2, 3 and 4. Furthermore, the reception quality proved to be the precursor factor in the construction of attack. It was also observed that there was no 1 st tempo of attacks from the backcourt, indicating that it is necessary to change the type of game, specifically with the increment of the speed of sets conducted by the backcourt...|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{interface}} of the 3DS, {{as well as to}} take advantage of the touch screen, 3D has vastly unique controls when compared to other games in the Metal Gear series. While the game has been heavily criticized for these control changes, use of the Circle Pad Pro peripheral has been cited to alleviate much of the control issues of the 3DS. This is done by restoring camera movement to the second analog stick, adding ZL and ZR buttons for aiming <b>and</b> <b>attacking,</b> and allowing the face buttons to be used in a manner more in line with all other releases in the Metal Gear series.|$|E
