5|$|Critics who <b>admire</b> <b>his</b> middle work might {{characterize}} it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system {{he began to}} work out for himself {{under the influence of}} spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of The Wanderings of Oisin, is reproduced in A Dialogue Between Self and Soul.|$|E

His father disagrees and then dies, leaving Krusty upset that his father did not <b>admire</b> <b>his</b> work. After an alcohol-induced coma, Krusty vows to do good in the world, and eventually {{with the help of}} Bart discovers that his father did enjoy his work. Meanwhile, due to the death of Krusty's father, Lisa obsesses over {{the health and safety of}} her father Homer.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus' {{last years}} were troubled by illness. He had {{suffered}} from a disease called the Uppsala fever in 1764, but survived thanks {{to the care of}} Rosén. He developed sciatica in 1773, and the next year, he had a stroke which partially paralysed him. He suffered a second stroke in 1776, losing the use of his right side and leaving him bereft of his memory; while still able to <b>admire</b> <b>his</b> own writings, he could not recognise himself as their author.|$|E

5|$|In short, had Mr. Boulton {{done nothing}} {{more in the}} world than he has {{accomplished}} in improving the coinage, his name would deserve to be immortalised; and if it be considered that this was done in the midst of various other important avocations, and at enormous expense,— for which, at the time, he could have had no certainty of an adequate return,—we shall be at a loss whether most to <b>admire</b> <b>his</b> ingenuity, his perseverance, or his munificence. He has conducted the whole more like a sovereign than a private manufacturer; and the love of fame has always been to him a greater stimulus than the love of gain. Yet it is to be hoped that, even in the latter point of view, the enterprise answered its purpose.|$|E
25|$|Zeng's {{legacy in}} history is twofold. On one hand he is criticised as a staunchly {{conservative}} traitor, but on another he {{is seen as}} a hero in preserving order and stability. Many in China and abroad <b>admire</b> <b>his</b> ability to successfully survive in the ruthless bureaucracy of the late Qing dynasty. Many have blamed Zeng for all the civilian losses and damages done during the Taiping Rebellion, while others criticise him for being too friendly with certain foreign ideas.|$|E
25|$|While {{out for a}} walk, Marianne {{gets caught}} {{in the rain and}} slips and sprains her ankle. The dashing John Willoughby sees the {{accident}} and assists her. Marianne quickly comes to <b>admire</b> <b>his</b> good looks and outspoken views on poetry, music, art, and love. His attentions lead Elinor and Mrs Dashwood to suspect that the couple have become secretly engaged. Elinor cautions Marianne against her unguarded conduct, but Marianne refuses to check her emotions. Abruptly, Mr Willoughby informs the Dashwoods that his aunt, upon whom he is financially dependent, is sending him to London on business, indefinitely. Marianne is distraught and abandons herself to her sorrow.|$|E

25|$|Mr. Randolph {{goes to the}} House booted and spurred, {{with his}} whip in hand, in imitation, it is said, {{of members of the}} British Parliament. He is a very slight man but of the common stature. At a little distance, he does not appear older than you are; but, upon a nearer approach, you {{perceive}} his wrinkles and grey hairs. He is, I believe, about thirty. He is a descendant in the right line from the celebrated Indian Princess, Pochahontas. The Federalists ridicule and affect to despise him; but a despised foe often proves a dangerous enemy. His talents are certainly far above mediocrity. As a popular speaker, he is not inferior to any man in the House. I <b>admire</b> <b>his</b> ingenuity and address; but I dislike his politics.|$|E
500|$|The critic John Ruskin {{compared}} {{the subtlety of}} his drawing to that of Holbein, J. M. W. Turner, and Paolo Veronese writing that the way Bewick had engraved the feathers of his birds was [...] "the most masterly thing ever done in woodcutting". His fame faded as illustration became more widespread and more mechanical, but twentieth-century artists such as Gwen Raverat (née Darwin) continued to <b>admire</b> <b>his</b> skill, and work by artists such as Paul Nash and Eric Ravilious {{has been described as}} reminiscent of Bewick.|$|E
500|$|Critics have {{observed}} that Hornung's stories and novels are well-structured. George Orwell wrote that Hornung was [...] "a very conscientious and on his level a very able writer. Anyone who cares for sheer efficiency must <b>admire</b> <b>his</b> work". Watson states that Hornung's [...] "writing has pace. The stories, however ridiculous, carry the readers along briskly". According to Cox, [...] "Hornung's work showed steady maturation" [...] during his career, a point that Doyle also agreed with, although Edwards disagrees, and thinks The Crime Doctor {{to be one of}} Hornung's weaker books.|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from writing}} and {{publishing}} cartoons, Lat has {{ventured into the}} fields of animation, merchandising, and theme parks with his creations. [...] His name and works are recognised internationally; foreign cartoonists, such as Matt Groening and Sergio Aragonés, <b>admire</b> <b>his</b> art, and foreign governments invite Lat to tour their countries, hoping to gain greater exposure for their countries through Lat's cartoons of his experiences in them. [...] After 27years of {{living and working in}} Kuala Lumpur, Lat moved back to Ipoh for a more sedate lifestyle in semi-retirement.|$|E
500|$|Ben {{goes to the}} Varner plantation. Will is away, but {{his only}} son, Jody, agrees to let Ben become a {{sharecropper}} on a vacant farm. When Will returns from a stay in the hospital, he is furious at Jody for hiring a notorious [...] "barn burner," [...] but soon begins to see in Ben a younger version of himself and comes to <b>admire</b> <b>his</b> ruthlessness and ambition, qualities that Jody lacks. Will is also disappointed with the man that his 23-year-old daughter, Clara, has been seeing {{for five or six}} years: Alan Stewart (Richard Anderson), a genteel Southern [...] "blue blood" [...] and a mama's boy.|$|E
500|$|Despite much prepublicity, Harlow {{received}} a lukewarm response from critics: Variety referred to Baker's portrayal of Harlow as [...] "a fairly reasonable facsimile, although she lacks the electric fire of the original." [...] Relations between Baker and Levine soured; in a 1965 interview, Baker sardonically commented: [...] "I'll {{say this about}} Joe Levine: I <b>admire</b> <b>his</b> taste in leading ladies," [...] which led the press to suspect a rift between the actress and producer. Baker sued Levine over her contract with Paramount Pictures in 1966, and was ultimately fired by Paramount and had her paychecks from Harlow frozen amid the contentious legal dispute; this left Baker {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars in debt (however, she was eventually awarded $1 million in compensation).|$|E

500|$|Kurosawa quickly {{moved on}} to his next project, Red Beard. Based on a short story {{collection}} by Shūgorō Yamamoto and incorporating elements from Dostoyevsky's novel The Insulted and Injured, it is a period film, set in a mid-nineteenth century clinic for the poor, in which Kurosawa's humanist themes receive perhaps their fullest statement. A conceited and materialistic, foreign-trained young doctor, Yasumoto, is forced to become an intern at the clinic under the stern tutelage of Doctor Niide, known as [...] "Akahige" [...] ("Red Beard"), played by Mifune. Although he resists Red Beard initially, Yasumoto comes to <b>admire</b> <b>his</b> wisdom and courage, and to perceive the patients at the clinic, whom he at first despised, as worthy of compassion and dignity.|$|E
500|$|Some {{contemporary}} scholars call Pericles a populist, a demagogue and a hawk, {{while other}} scholars <b>admire</b> <b>his</b> charismatic leadership. According to Plutarch, after assuming {{the leadership of}} Athens, [...] "he {{was no longer the}} same man as before, nor alike submissive to the people and ready to yield and give in to the desires of the multitude as a steersman to the breezes". It is told that when his political opponent, Thucydides, was asked by Sparta's king, Archidamus, whether he or Pericles was the better fighter, Thucydides answered without any hesitation that Pericles was better, because even when he was defeated, he managed to convince the audience that he had won. In matters of character, Pericles was above reproach {{in the eyes of the}} ancient historians, since [...] "he kept himself untainted by corruption, although he was not altogether indifferent to money-making".|$|E
500|$|Among {{fans and}} critics, Santa's Little Helper has been mostly well received. He ranked seventh in a 2008 poll by Dog Whisperers Cesar Millan that {{determined}} the [...] "best-loved television dog of all time." [...] Lassie ranked {{first in the}} poll. In addition, he was voted the tenth favorite Simpsons character by readers of Simpsons Comics in the United Kingdom in 2010. In a list of their top twelve favorite dogs from cartoons, comics, and animation, writers for The Tampa Tribune listed Santa's Little Helper at number six, writing: [...] "We <b>admire</b> <b>his</b> upbeat nature even after having his legs broken by Mr. Burns and being abandoned by Bart for another dog, Laddie." [...] He also ranked 75th on Retrocrush author Robert Berry's list of [...] "The 100 Greatest Dogs of Pop Culture History" [...] in 2006. The character has attracted some criticism too, though. While reviewing the episode [...] "Bart's Dog Gets an F" [...] in 2010, Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club wrote: ...|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Scott {{was asked}} [...] "Who's the biggest {{pain in the}} arse you've ever worked with?", he replied: [...] "It's got to be Harrison... he'll forgive me because now I get on with him. Now he's become charming. But he knows a lot, that's the problem. When we worked {{together}} {{it was my first}} film up and I was the new kid on the block. But we made a good movie." [...] Ford said of Scott in 2000: [...] "I <b>admire</b> <b>his</b> work. We had a bad patch there, and I'm over it." [...] In 2006 Ford reflected on the production of the film saying: [...] "What I remember more than anything else when I see Blade Runner is not the 50 nights of shooting in the rain, but the voiceover... I was still obliged to work for these clowns that came in writing one bad voiceover after another." [...] Ridley Scott confirmed in the summer 2007 issue of Total Film that Harrison Ford contributed to the Blade Runner Special Edition DVD, and had already recorded his interviews. [...] "Harrison's fully on board", said Scott.|$|E
500|$|Since the mid–1970s, {{references}} to Four Years Among the Cannibals {{have continued to}} appear in studies on New Guinea. In the 1990s, Detzner's work received some rehabilitation from ethnographer Terence Hays, who placed Detzner's work in its contemporary context: [...] Four Years Among the Cannibals, he wrote, [...] "paved the way for me [...] by creating romanticized images {{that served as a}} backdrop for more serious readings". [...] Since then, geographer Robert Linke has raised some important questions: [...] "Why did Detzner resort to lies to embellish his wonderful story? The unadorned truth would have been enough to establish him {{as one of the great}} figures in New Guinea history." [...] Detzner had remained at large for four years, as a fugitive in enemy-held territory: surely, Linke concluded, this was an exceptional feat. No doubt the Australians could have made a more broadly organized attempt to capture him, and probably would have succeeded, but they did not make the effort; they preferred instead the more convenient [...] "shoot-at-sight" [...] method. [...] "It is impossible", Linke wrote, [...] "not to <b>admire</b> <b>his</b> [...] sheer elan, his courage and tenacity." [...] In 2008, Detzner's book was retranslated, reprinted, and marketed as a modern translation of a rare and valuable book about the exploration of the New Guinean interior during World War I.|$|E
