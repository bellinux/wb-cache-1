30|$|In {{a similar}} way, Adam and Galinsky (2012) {{determined}} that when clothing has symbolic meaning for the wearer, it also affects the wearer’s behavior. The {{researchers found that}} a white lab coat was associated with traits related to attentiveness. Then they conducted an experiment in which one group wore a white lab coat described as a painter’s coat and another group wore the same lab coat which was described as <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> <b>doctor’s</b> lab coat. <b>A</b> third group saw, but did not wear, a lab coat described as <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> <b>doctor’s</b> lab coat. Participants then performed an experimental task that required selective attention. The group that wore the coat described as <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> <b>doctor’s</b> lab coat outperformed both {{of the other two}} groups.|$|R

5|$|Because {{his brother}} Orlando had become <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> <b>doctor,</b> Hugo decided {{at first to}} follow in his footsteps. At age seventeen, he left school and {{enrolled}} at Birmingham Medical School. However, it was Orlando who suggested that Hugo should enroll at the University of Alabama School of Law. After graduating in June 1906, he moved back to Ashland and established a legal practice. His practice was not successful there, so Black moved to Birmingham in 1907 where he specialized in labor law and personal injury cases.|$|E

The French Legion of Honor (Légion d'honneur) is the premier order of France, and its award is one of great distinction.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} there was a growing {{movement}} to attract native intelligentsia, educated at schools run by the Dutch colonial government, and convince them to view domestic films, which were generally considered to be of much lower quality than imported Hollywood productions. This was blamed, in part, on the dominance of theatrically trained actors and crew. As such, Ariffien invited Gani, at the time <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> <b>doctor</b> and a prominent member of the nationalist movement, to join the cast. Although some nationalists considered Gani's involvement in Asmara Moerni as besmirching the independence movement, Gani considered it necessary: he believed audiences needed to have higher opinions of domestic film productions.|$|E
