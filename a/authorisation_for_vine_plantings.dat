25|$|St. Georgener-Rebe {{was once}} known under the synonym Grün Muskatellar but {{appears to have}} no direct {{relationship}} to the Muscat family of grapes. In February 2011, the single surviving vine of St. Georgener-Rebe, thought to be over 500 years old, was vandalized and severely cut in several places by an unknown assailant. The vine survived with the Austrian government designating the vine as a protected natural monument. Ampelographers are currently propagating cuttings of the <b>vine</b> <b>for</b> vineyard <b>plantings</b> and commercial cultivation.|$|R
50|$|Outside of New York {{there were}} 15 acres (6 acres) of Ives noir in {{production}} in Arkansas, including some old <b>vine</b> <b>plantings</b> that were over 50 years old, {{as well as}} smaller plantings in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.|$|R
50|$|Rovello bianco {{is found}} almost {{exclusively}} {{in the province of}} Avellino in Campania. In the communes of Taurasi, Bonito and Mirabella Eclano centenarian old <b>vine</b> <b>plantings</b> of the variety still exist and are used in commercial wine production.|$|R
2500|$|In Australia, {{the variety}} (known there as Mataro) {{has had a}} long history in the country with plantings dating back to the mid-19th century. In the 1980s, many of these old <b>vine</b> <b>plantings</b> were uprooted in a {{government}} sponsored vine pulling scheme but some still survive and are producing today. While historically the variety was used mainly as an anonymous blending grape in fortified wines, the variety saw a rise in interest in the 1990s as producers started receiving acclaim for GSM (Grenache, Syrah, and Mourvèdre) [...] blends (many from the surviving, low yield old <b>vine</b> <b>plantings).</b> With a slight increase in planting there were more than 1000 ha of Mataro in Australia by the mid-2000s.|$|R
50|$|The name Calistoga {{dates back}} to 1857, with the first <b>vine</b> <b>plantings</b> in 1862. Viticultural and winery census data from 1880 list Calistoga as a {{distinct}} region separate from Napa. The appellation was proposed in 2003 by Bo Barrett petitioning for separate AVA status, with final approval coming through in 2009, effective 2010.|$|R
5000|$|Marechal Foch (Kuhlmann 188-2), De Chaunac (Seibel 9549), Baco noir, and Leon Millot {{are some}} of the {{successful}} hybrids introduced by de Chaunac. While vitis vinifera varieties have ultimately supplanted the majority of French hybrid plantings in eastern North America, hundreds of hectares remain in production, some even used to produce [...] "cult wines" [...] from old <b>vine</b> <b>plantings.</b>|$|R
50|$|While once widely planted {{throughout}} the South Tyrol region, Versoaln {{was on the}} verge of extinction until viticulturists with the Laimburg Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry and Free University of Bozen-Bolzano started propagating cuttings from the single, 350+ year old Versoaln vine planted at Castle Katzenzungen. As of 2012, there were approximately 100 new <b>vine</b> <b>plantings</b> of Versoaln in cultivation.|$|R
50|$|Château Guiraud is a sweet {{white wine}} ranked as Premier Cru Classé (French, “First Growth”) in the {{original}} Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855. Belonging to the Sauternes appellation in Gironde, {{in the region of}} Graves, the winery is located in the commune of Sauternes. The estate <b>vine</b> <b>plantings</b> consist of 65% Semillon and 35% Sauvignon Blanc. The vines are on average 35-40 years old.|$|R
50|$|Schiller Vineyards {{have over}} 160 acre under vine, when {{harvested}} {{majority of the}} grapes are sold to premium Barossa wine producers {{for the production of}} quality table wines. The vineyard plantings consist of a number of varieties, and varying ages of <b>vines.</b> <b>Plantings</b> include Shiraz, Grenache, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Mourvèdre, Chardonnay, Riesling, and Semillon. Majority of the harvest are sold to large local Barossa wineries.|$|R
50|$|While the Villard grapes {{were once}} widely planted {{throughout}} southern France, {{particularly in the}} wine regions of the southwest, and {{could be found in}} Bordeaux as well the vineyards of the northern Rhône Valley, today it is virtually eradicated from France. The few exceptions are isolated old <b>vine</b> <b>plantings</b> in the departments of Ardèche and Tarn which survived the vine-pulling period of the late 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Ampelographers {{believe that}} Termarina rossa {{is native to}} the Emilia-Romagna region and today this is {{where most of the}} <b>vine's</b> <b>plantings</b> can be found, {{particularly}} in the provinces of Parma and Reggio Emilia. Though the grape has a history in the region dating back to the 1840s, it was historically used mostly for jam and syrup production and so wasn't officially added to official register of Italian wine grape varieties until 2007.|$|R
5000|$|Grape {{cultivation}} {{began in}} the Cucamonga Valley in 1838 by Tiburcio Tapia on the Rancho Cucamonga, a Mexican land grant in Alta California. In 1859 rancher John Rains began large <b>vine</b> <b>plantings</b> in Cucamonga, introducing agriculture {{on a large scale}} to replace traditional cattle and sheep raising in the region. By 1917 the Cucamonga-Guasti vineyards spanned over 20,000 acres, and Secondo Guasti was advertising his vineyard as [...] "The Largest in the World." ...|$|R
25|$|The Loire Valley has a {{high density}} of <b>vine</b> <b>plantings</b> {{with an average of}} 1,600-2,000 vines per acre (4,000-5,000 per hectare). Some Sancerre {{vineyards}} have as many as 10,000 plants per hectare. With more <b>vines</b> competing <b>for</b> the same limited resources in the soil, the density is designed to compensate for the excessive yields that some of the grape varieties, like Chenin blanc, are prone to have. In recent times, pruning and canopy management have started to limit yields more effectively.|$|R
25|$|In the 1990s, {{the use of}} {{irrigation}} became more popular after droughts in 1994 and 1995 severely reduced the harvest in those years. In 1996, the practice of using irrigation in all Spanish wine regions was legalized with many regions quickly adopting the practice. In the province of Toledo, Australian flying winemakers helped to popularize the use of underground drip irrigation to minimize the effects of evaporation. The widespread use {{of irrigation}} has encouraged higher density of <b>vine</b> <b>plantings</b> and has contributed to higher yields {{in some parts of}} Spain.|$|R
25|$|Mourvèdre {{arrived in}} California in the 1860s {{as part of}} the Pellier collection. The variety, known as Mataro, was used {{primarily}} for bulk produced jug wines. In the late 20th century, interest in Mourvèdre as a premium grape variety picked up as the Rhone Rangers began seeking out old <b>vine</b> <b>plantings</b> of the variety in Contra Costa County vineyards. In the 1990s, critically acclaimed bottlings from Bonny Doon Vineyard and Cline Cellars Winery promoted demand in the variety and by the mid-2000s, plantings of Mourvèdre in California had risen to 260 ha (650 acres).|$|R
