5|$|The {{four types}} of flower parts, namely carpels, stamens, petals, and sepals, are {{homologous}} with and derived from leaves, as Goethe correctly noted in 1790. The development of these parts through a pattern of gene expression in the growing zones (meristems) is described by the <b>ABC</b> <b>model</b> of flower development. Each of the {{four types of}} flower parts is serially repeated in concentric whorls, controlled by {{a small number of}} genes acting in various combinations. Thus, A genes working alone result in sepal formation; A and B together produce petals; B and C together create stamens; C alone produces carpels. When none of the genes are active, leaves are formed. Two more groups of genes, D to form ovules and E for the floral whorls, complete the model. The genes are evidently ancient, as old as the flowering plants themselves.|$|E
25|$|<b>ABC</b> <b>model</b> {{of flower}} {{development}} is a scientific model of {{the process by which}} flowering plants produce a pattern of gene expression in meristems that leads to the appearance of an organ oriented towards sexual reproduction, a flower. There are three physiological developments that must occur in order for this to take place: firstly, the plant must pass from sexual immaturity into a sexually mature state (i.e. a transition towards flowering); secondly, the transformation of the apical meristem’s function from a vegetative meristem into a floral meristem or inflorescence; and finally the growth of the flower’s individual organs. The latter phase has been modelled using the <b>ABC</b> <b>model,</b> which aims to describe the biological basis of the process from the perspective of molecular and developmental genetics.|$|E
25|$|Cloning {{studies have}} been carried out on DNA in the genes {{associated}} with the affected homeotic functions in the mutants discussed above.

40|$|Discrete event {{simulation}} (DES) provides engineers with {{a flexible}} modeling capability for extensive {{analysis of a}} production flow and its dynamic behavior. Activity based costing (<b>ABC)</b> <b>modeling</b> can provide additional knowledge about the monetary costs related to the manufacturing processes in DES. In addition, <b>ABC</b> <b>modeling</b> has been proposed {{as a tool for}} environmental impact analysis. Thus, previous studies have separately brought ABC into DES and ABC into environmental impact analysis. Bringing all three areas together, an ABC environmental simulation could provide deeper understanding about environmental impacts in the manufacturing processes than a regular Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) analysis. This paper proposes to use <b>ABC</b> <b>modeling</b> in conjunction with DES to perform a more detailed economic and environmental impact cost analysis. It is emphasized that the time to perform both analysis in one simulation is shorter or equal to perform them separately. Moreover, the approach can resolve some LCA problems. ...|$|R

25|$|As {{discussed}} above, {{the floral}} organs of eudicotyledonous angiosperms {{are arranged in}} 4 different verticils, containing the sepals, petals, stamen and carpels. The <b>ABC</b> <b>model</b> states that the identity of these organs {{is determined by the}} homeotic genes A, A+B, B+C and C, respectively. In contrast with the sepal and petal verticils of the eudicots, the perigone of many plants of the Liliaceae family have two nearly identical external petaloid verticils (the tepals). In order to explain the floral morphology of the Liliaceae, van Tunen et al. proposed a modified <b>ABC</b> <b>model</b> in 1993. This model suggests that class B genes are not only expressed in verticils 2 and 3, but also in 1. It therefore follows that the organs of verticils 1 and 2 express class A and B genes and this is how they have a petaloid structure. This theoretical model has been experimentally proven through the cloning and characterization of homologs of the Antirrhinum genes GLOBOSA and DEFICIENS in a Liliaceae, the tulip Tulipa gesneriana. These genes are expressed in verticils 1,2 and 3.|$|E
25|$|Observations of {{homeotic}} mutations led to {{the formulation}} of the <b>ABC</b> <b>model</b> of flower development by E. Coen and E. Meyerowitz. According to this model, floral organ identity genes are divided into three classes: class A genes (which affect sepals and petals), class B genes (which affect petals and stamens), and class C genes (which affect stamens and carpels). These genes code for transcription factors that combine to cause tissue specification in their respective regions during development. Although developed through study of A. thaliana flowers, this model is generally applicable to other flowering plants.|$|E
25|$|The {{members of}} the MADS-box family of {{transcription}} factors play a very important and evolutionarily conserved role in flower development. According to the <b>ABC</b> <b>model</b> of flower development, three zones - A,B and C - are generated within the developing flower primordium, {{by the action of}} some transcription factors, that are {{members of the}} MADS-box family. Among these, the functions of the B and C domain genes have been evolutionarily more conserved than the A domain gene. Many of these genes have arisen through gene duplications of ancestral members of this family. Quite a few of them show redundant functions.|$|E

25|$|Mutations {{affecting}} flower morphology in Arabidopsis can {{be described}} by the <b>ABC</b> <b>model</b> of flower development. In this model, genes involved in flower formation belong {{to one of three}} classes of genes: A class genes which affect sepal and petal formation, B class genes which affect petal and stamen formation, and C class genes which affect stamen and carpel formation. These genes are expressed in certain regions of the developing flower and are responsible for development of organs in those regions. Agamous is a C class gene, a transcription factor responsible for activating genes involved in stamen and carpel development.|$|E
25|$|The homologs GLOBOSA and DEFICIENS {{have also}} been {{isolated}} and characterized in Agapanthus praecox ssp. orientalis (Agapanthaceae), which is phylogenetically distant from the model organisms. In this study the genes were called ApGLO and ApDEF, respectively. Both contain open reading frames that code for proteins with 210 to 214 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences indicated that they belong to B gene family of the monocotyledons. In situ hybridization studies revealed that both sequences are expressed in verticil 1 {{as well as in}} 2 and 3. When taken together, these observations show that the floral development mechanism of Agapanthus also follows the modified <b>ABC</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{identity}} of the organs present in the four floral verticils {{is a consequence of}} the interaction of at least three types of gene products, each with distinct functions. According to the <b>ABC</b> <b>model,</b> functions A and C are required {{in order to determine the}} {{identity of}} the verticils of the perianth and the reproductive verticils, respectively. These functions are exclusive and the absence of one of them means that the other will determine the identity of all the floral verticils. The B function allows the differentiation of petals from sepals in the secondary verticil, as well as the differentiation of the stamen from the carpel on the tertiary verticil.|$|E

25|$|Some {{of these}} changes also cause changes in {{expression}} patterns of the developmental genes, resulting in different phenotypes. The Floral Genome Project looked at the EST data from various tissues of many flowering plants. The researchers confirmed that the <b>ABC</b> <b>Model</b> of flower development is not conserved across all angiosperms. Sometimes expression domains change, {{as in the case}} of many monocots, and also in some basal angiosperms like Amborella. Different models of flower development like the fading boundaries model, or the overlapping-boundaries model which propose non-rigid domains of expression, may explain these architectures. There is a possibility that from the basal to the modern angiosperms, the domains of floral architecture have gotten more and more fixed through evolution.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ABC</b> <b>model</b> {{of flower}} {{development}} was first formulated by George Haughn and Chris Somerville in 1988.

Both species have four verticils (sepals, petals, stamens and carpels), which are defined by the differential expression {{of a number of}} homeotic genes present in each verticil. This means that the sepals are solely characterized by the expression of A genes, while the petals are characterized by the co-expression of A and B genes. The B and C genes establish the identity of the stamens and the carpels only require C genes to be active. It should be noted that type A and C genes are reciprocally antagonistic.|$|E
