5|$|After {{the cavalry}} {{breakthrough}} on the coast, the XXI Corps would advance {{to capture the}} headquarters of the Ottoman Eighth Army at Tulkarm <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> railway lines. Sections of the lateral rail line in the Judean Hills between Tulkarm and Nablus and a branch of the Jezreel Valley railway, were to be denied to the Seventh and Eighth Ottoman Armies. These lines, including the important railway junction at Messudieh, transported their supplies into the Judean Hills. The British infantry divisions were to continue their attack by swinging north–east, pivoting on their right to push the defenders back out of their trenches away from the coast and back into the Judean Hills towards Messudieh.|$|E
5|$|Alabama {{opened the}} second half with their second {{touchdown}} of the game. William Walker scored on a six-yard touchdown run <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> Tigers' lead to 18–10.

After a David Grayson touchdown for Alabama, Auburn responded with their final points of the game on a one-yard Dorsey run that made the final score 40–16. Governor of Alabama Thomas G. Jones presented a trophy to Auburn's captain Rufus Dorsey for their victory.|$|E

5|$|Difficult {{economic}} times marked Brown's term in office. During his tenure, the state's unemployment rate climbed from 5.6 percent to 11.7 percent. Brown {{stuck to his}} campaign promise not to raise taxes. When state income fell short of expectations, he reduced the state budget by 22 percent <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> number of state employees from 37,241 to 30,783, mostly through transfer and attrition. At the same time, his merit pay policies increased salaries for the remaining employees {{by an average of}} 34 percent. He cut the executive office staff from ninety-seven to thirty, and sold seven of the state's eight government airplanes.|$|E
5|$|In Bobby Petrino's {{first visit}} to Tuscaloosa as a head coach, Alabama opened conference play by {{defeating}} the Arkansas Razorbacks 35–7. After a scoreless first quarter, two big touchdown plays, a 52-yard run by Trent Richardson and a 50-yard pass from Greg McElroy to Julio Jones, had the Tide up 14–0 at the half. Arkansas responded early {{in the third quarter}} <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> lead to 14–7 after Ryan Mallett hit Greg Childs for an 18-yard touchdown reception; the Hogs would not reach the end zone again as the Tide responded with three unanswered touchdowns. Bama scored first on an 80-yard touchdown pass from McElroy to Marquis Maze followed with two touchdowns by Mark Ingram, one on a 14-yard pass from McElroy and one on a 2-yard run, bringing the final score to 35–7.|$|E
5|$|In December 1447, {{after leaving}} a {{protective}} force {{of three to}} four thousand men under Vrana Konti to guard the frontier {{in the event of}} an Ottoman incursion, Skanderbeg turned towards Dagnum with a force of 14,000 men. Initially offering the garrison at Dagnum the opportunity to surrender, he promptly besieged the fortress upon rejection. In order to pressure the Venetians, Skanderbeg also turned towards Durazzo, then another possession of Venetian Albania, <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> city off from their local resources and trade. This move forced Venice to redirect to Durazzo two galleys, which initially were bound for Crete, in order to watch over the events there.|$|E

Texas A opened {{the game with a}} pair of touchdowns on their first two offensive possessions and took a 14–0 lead. After they received the opening kickoff, the Aggies scored on their first possession when Johnny Manziel threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Cameron Clear and on their second possession on a one-yard Ben Malena touchdown run. Alabama responded with their first of five consecutive touchdowns on their next possession <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> A lead to 14–7 when AJ McCarron threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Norwood.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the {{divisions}} in the state party proved ruinous for Randall's chances at the Speaker's chair. Instead, the Democrats decided on Michael C. Kerr of Indiana, who was elected. Randall was instead named chairman of the Appropriations Committee. In that post, he focused on reducing the government's spending, <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> budget by $30,000,000, despite opposition from the Republican Senate. Kerr's health was fragile, and he was often absent from sessions, but Randall refused {{to take his place}} as speaker on a temporary basis, preferring to concentrate on his appropriations work. Kerr and Randall began to work more closely together through 1876, but Kerr died in August of that year, leaving the Speakership vacant once again.|$|E
5|$|In the third, Aubrey Miller {{recovered}} a Toledo fumble in the endzone {{for a touchdown}} <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> Rockets lead to 24–21.

In the fourth, Toledo scored 12 unanswered points for the win. Damon Nelson scored on a four-yard touchdown run and Hanna connected on field goals of 33 and 41 yards in the 43–28 win. The nine wins were the most won by a Toledo squad since the 1983 season.|$|E

5|$|In {{what became}} the first major battle of the campaign, the two sides fought a heavy {{engagement}} around Isurava in late August, as four Australian infantry battalions attempted to fend off attacks by a similarly sized Japanese force. On {{the other side of}} Eora Creek, clashes were fought around Abuari, as a Japanese battalion attempted to outflank the Australians at Isurava from the west, <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> track around Alola, while another Japanese battalion attempted to flank Isurava to the west. Subjected to a heavy Japanese artillery bombardment, and lacking their own with which to counter this indirect fire, the Australians defended for four days, before conducting a withdrawal in contact, falling back towards Templeton's Crossing, which was the scene of further fighting in early September 1942.|$|E

5|$|On {{the kickoff}} {{following}} the field goal, Georgia head coach Mark Richt ordered an unorthodox onside kick. Surprised by the unexpected play, the Virginia Tech coverage team {{was unable to}} recover the ball, which was leapt upon by the kicker, Brian Mimbs. With a new chance at offense {{and a sense of}} optimism triggered by the successful onside kick, Georgia drove down the field. Aided by 20yards in penalties against Virginia Tech, the drive resulted in a six-yard touchdown pass to Martrez Milner. The touchdown and extra point boosted Georgia's morale <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> score to 21–13, Virginia Tech leading by eight.|$|E

5|$|Some {{years after}} the events in Tarifa, a quarrel erupted between the Marinids and the Nasrids, in 1306. The Nasrids {{promptly}} sponsored the rebellion of Uthman ibn Idris, a pretender to the Marinid throne in Morocco. Uthman was landed by a Nasrid force in Ceuta, and quickly carved out an enclave. The rebels continued to receive support across the strait from the Nasrid garrisons. It is believed that the Marinid sultan Abu al-Rabi Sulayman, unable to dislodge the rebel from Ceuta, intrigued with the Castilians, whose truce with Granada was about to expire, encouraging them to take Algeciras and Gibraltar <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> rebel off. The first siege of Gibraltar was a side-operation of the main Castilian siege of Algeciras in 1309–10.|$|E
5|$|The 5th Light Horse Brigade {{commanded}} by Brigadier General Macarthur Onslow with the 2nd New Zealand Machine Gun Squadron attached, had been instructed by {{the commander of}} the 60th Division to bypass Tulkarm if it was strongly defended, <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> main road to Nablus from Tulkarm.

5|$|Venice {{could not}} {{directly}} confront the large Ottoman expeditionary force on Crete, {{but it did}} possess a fine navy, that could intervene <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman supply routes. In 1645, the Venetians and their allies possessed a fleet of 60–70 galleys, 4 galleasses and about 36 galleons. The Venetians were also superior {{in their use of}} a mixed fleet of both galleys and sailing ships, while initially, the Ottoman navy relied almost exclusively on galleys. In order to bolster their forces, both opponents hired armed merchantmen from the Netherlands, and later from England (especially the Ottomans), to augment their forces.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the morning}} of 1 September had passed, reports coming into US 2nd Division {{headquarters}} {{made it clear that}} North Koreans had penetrated to the north–south Changnyong-Yongsan road <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> division in two; the 38th and 23d Infantry Regiments with the bulk of the division artillery in the north were separated from the division headquarters and the 9th Infantry Regiment in the south. Division commander Major General Laurence B. Keiser decided that this situation made it advisable to control and direct the divided division as two special forces. Accordingly, he placed the division artillery commander, Brigadier General Loyal M. Haynes, in command of the northern group. Southward, in the Yongsan area, Keiser placed Brigadier General Joseph S. Bradley, Assistant Division Commander, in charge of the 9th Infantry Regiment, the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, most of the 72nd Tank Battalion, and other miscellaneous units of the division. This southern grouping was known as Task Force Bradley.|$|E
