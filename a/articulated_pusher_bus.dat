The next day in class she publicly asks Emily if she caused the accident. Emily says nothing, and runs from the room.|$|R
50|$|On 25 August 1947, she {{proceeded}} to Orange, Tex., {{where she was}} decommissioned the same day and assigned to the Texas Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet. The tug was named Undaunted on 16 July 1948 and transferred to {{the custody of the}} Maritime Administration—although still owned by the Navy—in September 1961. By January 1963, her name was struck from the Navy list. She was later transferred to the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries. She was then loaned as a training vessel to the US Merchant Marine academy at Kings Point, NY and renamed the T/V Kings Pointer. In 1993 the Kings Pointer was sold to basic Towing of Escanaba, MI and was renamed the Krystal K. In 1998 the vessel was sold again to Pere Marquette Shipping of Ludington, MI for use as a push tug for their 400 bulk barge Pere Marquette 41. The Krystal K was rebuilt as an <b>articulated</b> <b>pusher</b> tug and received a Hydraconn connection system and an elevated pilot house. Upon completion the tug was given her original name of Undaunted. The M/T Undaunted is still in service to this day on the Great Lakes.|$|R
50|$|Modern low-floor <b>pusher</b> <b>articulated</b> buses {{also tend}} to suffer from {{suspension}} problems because their wheels lack the ampleness of travel that {{would enable them to}} absorb surface unevennesses. This also leads to passenger discomfort and relatively rapid disintegration of the vehicle's superstructure.|$|R

25|$|On June 23, 2008, a bus loading {{passengers}} {{was struck}} by an out-of-control dump truck {{at the corner of}} Bowery and Canal Street in New York’s Chinatown. The force of the impact <b>pushed</b> the <b>bus</b> onto the sidewalk and into a bank. As the result of the accident, a sign attached to a light pole fell, injuring a 57-year-old woman; the woman later died {{as the result of a}} heart attack. Several people, including two police officers, were treated for minor injuries. State Department of Transportation inspectors found that the dump truck, owned by CPQ Freight Systems, had eight mechanical issues including faulty brakes which led to the accident.|$|R
5|$|Mara {{replaced}} Gibson as the team's president {{before the}} 1927 season. He told March to spend whatever he felt necessary {{to build a}} championship caliber team. March overhauled the roster and the team finished 11–1–1, while winning its first NFL championship. They barely broke even financially however, and the team was still giving away as many as 4,000 tickets a game. Mara decided to reduce costs the following season, and instead of traveling first class, the Giants drove to games in a used bus, and stayed at local YMCAs instead of hotels. The team had to <b>push</b> the <b>bus</b> once for several miles when it broke down, and players had trouble sleeping at the Y. They won only four games, and Mara lost $40,000.|$|R

50|$|Sea urchins {{use their}} tube feet {{to move around}} {{in a similar way}} to starfish. Some also use their <b>articulated</b> spines to <b>push</b> or lever {{themselves}} along or lift their oral surfaces off the substrate. If a sea urchin is overturned, it can extend its tube feet in one ambulacral area far enough to bring them within reach of the substrate and then successively attach feet from the adjoining area until it is righted. Some species bore into rock and they usually do this by grinding away at the surface with their mouthparts.|$|R
50|$|The caliper tool {{measures}} {{the variation in}} borehole diameter as it is withdrawn {{from the bottom of}} the hole, using two or more <b>articulated</b> arms that <b>push</b> against the borehole wall. Each arm is typically connected to a potentiometer which causes the resistance to change as the diameter of the borehole changes, creating a varying electrical signal that represents the changing shape of the borehole. This variation in output is translated into changes of diameter after a simple calibration and the caliper log is printed as a continuous series of values of hole diameter with depth.|$|R
50|$|Locomotive {{propelled}} Jordan Ditcher/Spreaders {{are still}} sometimes used to plow especially deep {{snow in the}} US on the former Wisconsin Central railroad. These machines carry large main plows and hydraulic or air powered <b>articulating</b> wings to <b>push</b> snow {{far away from the}} tracks, sometimes past the next adjacent track to facilitate clearing snow from yards and sidings. These machines can also used to create ditches and plow the tracks clear of loose material during maintenance operations. Russell Plows are still in service at some locations, with large front wedge plows and shorter hinged air powered wings only suitable for plowing snow.|$|R
25|$|On {{the basis}} of outputs, {{comparators}} can also be classified as open drain or push–pull. Comparators with an open-drain output stage use an external pull up resistor to a positive supply that defines the logic high level. Open drain comparators {{are more suitable for}} mixed-voltage system design. Since the output is high impedance for logic level high, open drain comparators {{can also be used to}} connect multiple comparators on to a single <b>bus.</b> <b>Push</b> pull output does not need a pull up resistor and can also source current unlike an open drain output.|$|R

40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} one of the leading causes of death, by cancer. The usual {{treatment}} is surgical resection of tumours. However, patients who are weak or have poor pulmonary function are deemed unfit for surgery. For these patients, a minimally-invasive approach is desired. A major problem associated with minimally-invasive approaches is tumour localization in real time and accurate measurement of tool [...] tissue forces. This thesis describes the design, analysis, manufacturing and validation of a minimally-invasive instrument for tumour localization, named Palpatron. The instrument has an end effector that is able to support two previously designed jaws, one containing an ultrasound sensor and the other a tactile sensor. The jaws can move with two degrees of freedom to palpate tissue and rotate about the central axis of the instrument. The Palpatron has uncoupled jaw motion that allows for optimal alignment of sensors to improve data acquisition. The instrument can be easily assembled and disassembled allowing it to be cleaned and sterilized. The mechanism is <b>articulated</b> using <b>push</b> rods, each actuated by a motor. A semi-automatic control system was created for palpation. It is composed of a microcontroller that controls four motors via serial communication. In addition, the Palpatron has the ability to prevent tissue damage by measuring tool [...] tissue forces. Finite element analysis was used to guide material selection for designed components. Grade 5 titanium was selected for end effector links to provide a factor of safety of 1. 2 against yielding under a 10 N point load at the tip of a jaw. The design was fabricated and validated by conducting experiments to test articulation and load carrying capacity. An 8 -N force was applied to the instrument, which was successfully supported. The semi-automatic control system was used to perform basic maneuvering tasks to verify jaw motion capabilities. With positive testing results, the Palpatron forms the next step towards a comprehensive robotic-assisted palpation technology...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{knowledge}} is increasingly {{being seen as}} a potential source of economic value in the Pacific Islands region. As a result of this, and a belief that traditional {{knowledge is}} currently at risk {{in a number of}} respects, a move to protect it has developed over the past decade. This move has largely focused on the creation, through legislation, of a sui generis inalienable and perpetual property right in traditional knowledge, vested in its “owners” or “holders. ” However, to date, very little {{attention has been paid to}} the issue of determining who these owners or holders should be. The first part of this article seeks to fill this gap by highlighting the institutional and normative issues implicated in any legislation that envisages group ownership over traditional knowledge. The second part proposes an alternative approach to the regulation of traditional knowledge, one that is not based on the creation of new proprietary rights. It argues that this alternative “regulatory toolbox” approach can achieve the same objectives for the protection of traditional knowledge that have been <b>articulated</b> in the <b>push</b> for the development of sui generis legislation, while avoiding many of the potential sites of conflict inherent in such an approach...|$|R
5000|$|The second {{target of}} Mossad was Mahmoud Hamshari, the PLO {{representative}} in France. Israel {{believed that he}} was the leader of Black September in France. Using an agent posing as an Italian journalist, Mossad lured him from his apartment in Paris to allow a demolition team to enter and install a bomb underneath a desk telephone. On December 8, 1972, the agent posing as a journalist phoned Hamshari's apartment and asked if he was speaking to Hamshari. After Hamshari identified himself, the agent signalled to other colleagues, who then sent a detonation signal down the telephone line, causing the bomb to explode. Hamshari was mortally wounded in the explosion, but managed to remain conscious long enough to tell Parisian detectives what had happened. Hamshari died in a hospital several weeks later. He had given an interview a day after the hostage crisis, saying he was not worried for his life, but did not want to [...] "taunt the devil." [...] Mossad did not comment on the fact that Hamsari was connected to the attack of Munich. This assassination was {{the first in a series}} of Mossad assassinations that took place in France. [...] Another assassination took place in London, where a Palestinian activist was <b>pushed</b> under a <b>bus</b> during rush hour.|$|R
