40|$|ABSTRACT) This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of an Airspace Sector Occupancy Model (ASOM). The model determines the occupancy of Air Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) sectors for a given geometry of sectors and flight schedules, and can be used to study the impact of <b>alternative</b> <b>flight</b> schedules on the workload imposed on the sectors. Along with complimentary airspace analysis models, this can serve as an advisory tool to approve flight plans in the Free Flight Scenario, or to reschedule flights around a Special Use Airspace (SUA). ASOM is developed using Matlab 5. 2, and can be run on an IBM compatible PC, Macintosh, or Unix Workstation. The computerized model incorporates the powerful features of graphics and hierarchical modeling inherent in Matlab, to design an effectiv...|$|E

40|$|The {{relocation}} of flight altitudes is a straightforward example how {{the impact of}} aviation on climate may be reduced by operational means. However, due to possible tradeoffs between the individual climate impact components, dedicated tools have to be developed to enable a swift quantitative assessment of the option of <b>alternative</b> <b>flight</b> routing. We report on current activities to develop such a tool. A comprehensive 3 -dimensional (3 d) climate model serves to calculate key numbers describing the impact of individual impact components for selected scenarios, while a linear global response model is used to convert these numbers into an overall impact metric for a given flight routing alternative. The approach builds on well-established models, which nevertheless have to be revised, extended, and then optimally combined to address the problem...|$|E

40|$|The climate {{impact of}} {{aviation}} may be minimized by selecting routes with minimum warming from contrail cirrus and CO 2. Such an approach requires sufficient scientific understanding.

40|$|The Collaborative Trajectory Options Program (CTOP) is a Traffic Management Initiative (TMI) {{intended}} {{to control the}} air traffic flow rates at multiple specified Flow Constrained Areas (FCAs), where demand exceeds capacity. CTOP allows flight operators to submit the desired Trajectory Options Set (TOS) for each affected flight with associated Relative Trajectory Cost (RTC) for each option. CTOP then creates a feasible schedule that complies with capacity constraints by assigning affected flights with routes and departure delays {{in such a way}} as to minimize the total cost while maintaining equity across flight operators. The current version of CTOP implements a Ration-by-Schedule (RBS) scheme, which assigns the best available options to flights based on a First-Scheduled-First-Served heuristic.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of a long}} range hypersonic transportation system is {{to take advantage of}} high altitude and high velocity to perform intercontinental flight in the order on one hour. The SpaceLiner concept has been proposed by the Space Launcher Systems Analysis group (SART) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR).

This paper presents the results of the Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) analyses for the SpaceLiner concept. The flight mechanics of the Spaceliner concept is analysed to provide requirements in terms of Flying Qualities, layout (centre of gravity location), angle of attack corridor and entry corridor during the flight.
