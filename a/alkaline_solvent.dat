Transparent conducting oxide (TCOs) thin films, including non-stoichiometric tin doped indium oxide (ITO) and aluminium doped zinc oxide (AZO), have found considerable applications in various displays, solar cells, and electrochromic devices, due to their unique combination of high electrical conductivity and optical transparency. TCO thin films are normally fabricated by sputtering, thermal vapour deposition and sol-gel method. Among them, sol-gel processing, which was employed in this project, is no doubt the simplest and cheapest processing method, The main objectives of this project were to produce indium tin oxides (ITO) and zinc aluminium oxides (AZO) nanoparticles with controlled particle size and morphology and to fabricate TCO thin films with high optical transmittance and electrical conductivity. In this research, hydrothermal method was used to synthesise ITO and AZO nanoparticles. Tin oxides, zinc oxides, ITO and AZO particles with the particle size ranging from 10 nm to several micrometers and different morphologies were synthesised through controlling the starting salts, <b>alkaline</b> <b>solvents</b> and hydrothermal treatment conditions. ITO and AZO thin films were fabricated via sol-gel technique through dip coating method.

40|$|Monoethanolamine (MEA) is the {{benchmark}} solvent for {{the capture of}} carbon dioxide from both natural gas and flue gas streams. Despite its effectiveness in absorbing CO 2, this solvent can react with impurities in the gas stream to form heat stable salts and other degradation products.

Thus, a number of approaches have been considered to mitigate the occurrence of these problems. In this paper, the use of electrodialysis as an online MEA reclamation process in a postcombustion CO 2 capture facility is investigated.

40|$|To enhance {{extraction}} of strongly bound metals from oxide minerals and organic matter, {{this study examined}} the sequential use of reductants, oxidants, <b>alkaline</b> <b>solvents</b> and organic acids followed by a biodegradable chelating agent (EDDS, [S,S]-ethylene-diamine-disuccinic-acid) in a two-stage soil washing. The soil was contaminated by Cu, Zn, and Pb at an e-waste recycling site in Qingyuan city, China. In addition to extraction efficiency, this study also examined the fate of residual metals (e. g., leachability, bioaccessibility, and distribution) and the soil quality parameters (i. e., cytotoxicity, enzyme activities, and available nutrients). The reductants (dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate and hydroxylamine 'hydrochloride) effectively extracted metals by mineral dissolution, but elevated the leachability and bioaccessibility of metals due to the transformation from Fe/Mn oxides to labile fractions. Subsequent EDDS washing was found necessary to mitigate the residual risks. In comparison, prior washing by oxidants (persulphate, hypochlorite, and hydrogen peroxide) was marginally useful because of limited amount of soil organic matter. Prior washing by <b>alkaline</b> <b>solvents</b> (sodium hydroxide and sodium bicarbonate) was also ineffective due to metal precipitation. In contrast, prior washing by low-molecular weight organic acids (citrate and oxalate) improved the extraction efficiency. Compared to hydroxyl amine hydrochloride, citrate and oxalate induced lower cytotoxicity (Microtox) and allowed higher enzyme activities (dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase, and urease) and soil nutrients (available nitrogen and phosphorus), which would facilitate reuse of the treated soil. Therefore, while sequential washing proved to enhance extraction efficacy, the selection of chemical agents besides EDDS should also include the consideration of effects on metal leachability/bioaccessibility and soil quality.

Natural and man-made fibres are usually plagued with problems (e. g. economic and environmental) and are unsuitable in meeting growing demands. The focus of this thesis was therefore to investigate the dissolution of cellulose derived from various pulps in novel aqueous solvent systems.             It was shown that cellulose could be dissolved in a NaOH/H 2 O solvent at low temperatures (< 0 °C) and that such an <b>alkaline</b> <b>solvent</b> can be improved regarding the solubility, stability and rheological properties of the cellulose dopes formed if different additives (salts or amphiphilic molecules) are used.

These pretreatments affected, as expected, some characteristic properties of the pulps mainly by reducing the DP but also, for example, changing the composition of the carbohydrates. Not only did the pretreatment affect the solubility it also increased the stability of the cellulose dopes, resembling the effect of chemical additives to the NaOH system. According to multivariate data analysis it was established that, of the pulp properties analyzed, only the composition of carbohydrates and the DP had a significant influence on the solubility of the pulps used in this study.

One target for green engineering is in reaction and separation design. This is typically done in a wasteful and often toxic manner with organic solvents and lack of recycle. The following thesis discusses alternatives to these costly separations by means of ionic liquids, benign extraction, separation with carbon dioxide, and near critical water. Ionic liquids are combined with carbon dioxide to induce melting point depressions of up to 124 degrees Celsius. Using this system as a reaction medium will offer control over the reaction phases while utilizing green solvents. Benign extractions are performed on both ferulic acid and on proteins from biomass by replacing <b>alkaline</b> <b>solvents</b> and costly protein separation techniques with simple liquid-liquid extraction. This means simpler systems and less waste than from previous methods. This thesis also discusses an opportunity for more efficient separation and recycle of a pharmaceutical catalyst, Mn-Salen. Using carbon dioxide with the organic aqueous tunable solvent system, the reaction can be run homogeneously and the product and catalyst separated heterogeneously, thus creating an extremely efficient process. Lastly, near critical water is used as an extraction and reaction medium by extracting ferulic acid from Brewers Spent Grain and then catalyzing its transformation to 4 -vinylguaiacol. In this manner a simple, benign process is used to turn waste into valuable chemicals. Although somewhat different, each of the studied processes strives to eliminate waste and toxicity of many commonly used reaction and separation techniques, thus creating safe and sustainable processes.

Firstly, the methodology needed to develop the analysis is explained, basically, an exergy study is done in order to know where the exergy destruction is more considerable and the final value achieves in the biogas upgrading process. After that, the exergo-economic analysis computes the unitary cost of the different streams and the cost of the components from the plant in order to characterize the cost-rate of the different streams of the process. Finally, an optimization methodology is explained and apply into the process in order to know in which components the optimization is more necessary and also, to understand the nature of the optimization itself that is to say if the optimization is need to be done regarding the efficiency or the cost of the component. Furthermore, the biogas upgrading plant is study in order to calculate the efficiency of the whole process taking into account the energy generated and the energy consumption. The energy consumption is obtained and compared with the bibliography values collected in order to verify the value. However, the thermodynamic part is not only studied, also an economic study is carried out to the biogas upgrading plant. The economic study is done in order to guarantee that the biogas upgrading plant is a feasible project. Because of that, the Net Present Value (NPV), the Benefic-cost ratio (BCR), the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and the Payback Time (PBT) have been calculated. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis has been done varying different parameters of the plant. It is important to comment that the monetary benefits are given due to the sale of the biomethane. Because of that, the incentives given by the government are a significant parameter that needs to be defined. Not only a base case has been studied, different cases have been also defined in order to understand in a more complete way the biogas upgrading process through a chemical absorption. These cases are: the variation of the final purity of the biomethane, the variation of the capacity of the plant varying the volume flow of biogas and the variation of the operational parameters of the absorber. After the final discussion of the obtained results, the future lines of research have been defined at the end of the project in order to identify the following steps that can be done to continue the development of the biogas upgrading process...|$|E

In fact, a boost in food demand is mainly required in developing countries, where the farmlands are limited and/or they are of poor quality. Rather than improving crop-production yield, developing biorefinery technology with unused biomass, such as leaves, in developing countries {{may be the key}} to fulfil the food demand. Four major components, protein, pectin, lignin, and (hemi-) cellulose, account for more than 70 % of the materials in leaves in almost all species. Among these components, protein and pectin can be used in food and animal feed, and they are key components for supplementing food production. However, the production and application of leaf products is limited for four reasons: unstable raw materials, complex components, rigid plant cell walls, and underdeveloped leaf logistics and economics. The limitations cause low pectin and protein yields, and low cost-efficiency in current extraction technologies, including mechanical milling, chemical extraction (acid and <b>alkaline),</b> <b>solvent</b> extraction, and ammonia protein extraction. Development of an integrated process for multiple products might be a good option for leaf biorefinery, but the compatibilities of these processes were unknown. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop new processes and applications that optimally utilize all components, particularly protein, of leafy biomass in the feed and/or food industry using green tea residues as a starting material. The method should also be applicable to other leafy biomass. The research started from the development of alkaline protein extraction technology as presented in Chapter 2. We found that in alkaline protein extraction, temperature, NaOH amount, and extraction time are the parameters determining protein yield, while pH and volume of extraction liquid are critical parameters for production cost. After optimization, more than 90 % of leaf protein could be extracted at a cost of 102 €/ton protein by single step alkaline extraction. The extracted protein nutritional value was comparable to soybean meal and this technique can be adapted to various leafy biomass. Main drawback of this technique is the overuse of alkali, generation of salts, and the destruction of key amino acids, such as lysine, during the extraction. We tried to overcome its drawbacks by developing integrated process with a recycle for chemicals. Chapter 3, 4, 5, and 6 refer to the integrated biorefinery. For a better design, we investigated how the alkali aided protein extraction (Chapter 3), and proved that alkaline protein extraction was not facilitated by increased solubility or hydrolysis of protein, but positively correlated to leaf tissue disruption. HG pectin, RGII pectin, polyphenols, and organic acids can be extracted before protein. Protein extraction can then be followed by the extraction of cellulose and hemi-cellulose. RGI pectin and lignin yield were both linearly correlated to protein yield, which indicated that they are likely to be the key limitation to leaf protein extraction. Based on the above findings, an integrated biorefinery that combined protein extraction with a pre-treatment was proposed. In Chapter 4, ethanol, viscozyme, and H 2 O 2 were selected for pre-treatments targeting on the removal of polyphenols and pigments, carbohydrates, and lignin accordingly. Ethanol and viscozyme could extract their targeting components efficiently while H 2 O 2 could bleach GTR with no lignin extracted. The best pre-treatment was the combination of viscozyme and 50 % ethanol extraction, which not only reduced the use of alkali by 50 %, but also improved protein content and its nutritional value. As pectin can be applied for food or chemicals, enzyme and PBS buffer were investigated for pectin extraction (Chapter 5). Both enzyme and PBS buffer extraction could not only extract high yield HG pectin (predominated by galacturonic acid) with no protein extraction, but also reduced alkali usage in subsequent protein extraction. Pectin obtained using PBS buffer could be present in its native form, which can be precipitated by 40 % ethanol. Buffer is suggested to extract pectins when pectins are to be used in food. Otherwise, hydrolyzed pectin that mainly contains galacturonic acid, can be converted to other useful chemicals. For this the enzymatic methods, such as using Viscozyme® L, are recommended. Alkali usage was further optimized. It was found that by using potassium hydroxide, the protein extraction efficiency was similar to that using sodium hydroxide. The waste water, mainly containing potassium salts, can then be used as fertilizer. This technique is highly depending on the location of factories, which should be built close to the field. Alternatively, calcium hydroxide can be used. As calcium salts can be precipitated by CO 2 and calcium hydroxide can be regenerated through burning of the precipitate, this scheme is sustainable and adaptable to most situations. However, as calcium also precipitated pectin, ployphenols, and even proteins, the protein yield is relatively low. Although a pre-treatment can improve extraction efficiency of calcium hydroxide, economic results suggested that a pre-treatment is not necessary unless the products obtained by pre-treatment have an attractive market value. In Chapter 7, we extend our knowledge on leaf biorefinery with some additional experiments and literature. Simplified models of leaf tissues and cell walls were proposed and used to explain the mechanism of alkaline protein extraction. The models were also used to explain other mechanisms for protein extraction; mechanical milling, steam explosion, acid, and enzyme aided extraction. The possible improvements of leaf biorefinery economics were illustrated either by reducing production cost, by e. g. using counter current extraction or ultrafiltration, or by upgrading product value by applying protein and pectin in food. The processes recommended in this thesis show an excellent prospective, in which they are applicable to other leaf biomass and suitable for small-scale production.  ...|$|E

For all compositions high molecular weight copolymers were prepared with excellent film-forming properties. Tercopolymers of l-leucine, β-benzyl-l-aspartate and β-methyl-l-aspartate [Leu/Asp(OBz) /Asp(OMe) ] were obtained after an ester interchange reaction (conversion 85 – 95 %) with the original copolymer systems. These tercopolymers were characterized by elemental analysis and i. r. spectroscopy. Films of the tercopolymers, cast from organic solvents, could be converted into hydrophilic films by saponification of the methyl ester groups using <b>alkaline</b> water/organic <b>solvent</b> media.

The main aim was to study the compositional alterations undergone by the fig tissues in a particular archaeological environment: the fig was in a vessel and covered by a layer of a mixture of orpiment and gypsum. A comparison between the GC/MS results from modern and archaeological figs revealed that degradative reactions took place, leading to the disappearance/depletion of reactive (unsaturated fatty acids) and sensitive compounds (phytosterols and triterpenes). Py-silylation-GC/MS data provided evidence of a significant degradation of the saccharide and lipid components of the fig tissue, which left a residue enriched in polyphenols and polyesters...|$|R
