40|$|Abstract Background Whether {{the primary}} care physician's <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> patient <b>compliance</b> is a {{valuable}} prognostic marker to identify patients who {{are at increased risk}} of death, or merely reflects measurement of various treatment parameters such as HbA 1 C or other laboratory markers is unclear. The objective of this prospective cohort study was to investigate the prognostic value <b>of</b> the physicians' <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> patient <b>compliance</b> and other factors with respect to all-cause mortality during a one year follow-up period. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted among 1014 patients with type 2 diabetes aged 40 and over (mean age 69 years, SD 10. 4, 45 % male) who were under medical treatment in 11 participating practices of family physicians and internists working in primary care in a defined region in South Germany between April and June 2000. Baseline data were gathered from patients and physicians by standardized questionnaire. The physician's <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> patient <b>compliance</b> was assessed by means of a 4 -point Likert scale (very good, rather good, rather bad, very bad). In addition, we carried out a survey among physicians by means of a questionnaire to find out which aspects for the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> patient <b>compliance</b> were <b>of</b> importance to make this <b>assessment.</b> Active follow-up <b>of</b> patients was conducted after one year to determine mortality. Results During the one year follow-up 48 (4. 7 %) of the 1014 patients died. Among other factors such as patient type (patients presenting at office, nursing home or visited patients), gender, age and a history of macrovascular disease, the physician's <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> patient <b>compliance</b> was an important predictor of all-cause mortality. Patients whose compliance was assessed by the physician as "very bad" (6 %) {{were significantly more likely to}} die during follow-up (OR = 2. 67, 95 % CI 1. 02 – 6. 97) after multivariable adjustment compared to patients whose compliance was assessed as "rather good" (45 %) or "very good" (18 %). The HbA 1 C -value and the cholesterol level at baseline showed no statistically significant association with all-cause mortality. According to our survey for most of the physicians self-acceptance of disease, treatment adherence, patient's interest in physician's explanations, attendance at appointments, a good self-management, and a good physician-patient relationship were key elements in the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> patient <b>compliance.</b> Conclusion The primary care physician's <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> patient <b>compliance</b> is a valuable prognostic marker for mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes. Identification of patients in need <b>of</b> improved <b>compliance</b> may help to target preventive measures. </p...|$|R

50|$|To enhance deposit {{insurance}} effectiveness and meet its Members’ needs, IADI undertakes research and issues core principles and supporting guidance. The Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems (Core Principles) were first issued by IADI and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in June 2009, and updated by IADI in October 2014. IADI’s Core Principles promote best international standards in {{deposit insurance}} {{and support the}} stability and soundness of financial systems. IADI, {{in collaboration with the}} BCBS, IMF, the World Bank, European Forum of Deposit Insurers (EFDI) and European Commission developed a Methodology for the <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Compliance</b> with the Core Principles. Such assessments include self-assessments and Financial Sector Assessment Programs (FSAPs) reviews conducted by IMF and the World Bank, as well as country and peer review programs conducted by the FSB. Being a part of the FSB Compendium of Key Standards for Sound Financial Systems, the IADI Core Principles are used by international community in assessing the condition of financial systems. A comprehensive, credible and action-oriented assessment of a deposit insurer against the Core Principles identifies strengths and weaknesses in an existing system and forms a basis for improvement measures by policymakers. Proper application of the IADI Core Principles gives significant advantage in the pursuit of financial stability, pairing the right protection for retail depositors with more multifaceted aspects of crisis management. The details about the Core Principles can be found on IADI website with the underscore link.|$|E
50|$|Proponents {{of welfare}} reform argued that {{encouraging}} maternal employment will enhance children’s cognitive and emotional development. A working mother, proponents assert, provides a positive role model for her children. Opponents, on the other hand, argued that requiring women to work at low pay puts additional stress on mothers, reduces the quality time spent with children, and diverts income to work-related expenses such as transportation and childcare. Evidence is mixed {{on the impact of}} TANF on child welfare. Duncan & Chase-Lansdale (2001) found that the impact {{of welfare reform}} varied by age of the children, with generally positive effects on school achievement among elementary-school age children and negative effects on adolescents, especially with regards to risky or problematic behaviors. Another study found large and significant effects of welfare reform on educational achievement and aspirations, and on social behavior (i.e. teacher <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> and self-control, competence and sensitivity). The positive effects were largely due to the quality of childcare arrangement and afterschool programs that accompanied the move from welfare to work for these recipients. Yet another study found that substitution from maternal care to other informal care had caused a significant drop in performance of young children. In a program with less generous benefits, Kalili et al. (2002) found that maternal work (measured in months and hours per week) had little overall effect on children’s antisocial behavior, anxious/depressed behavior or positive behavior. They find no evidence that children were harmed by such transitions; if anything, their mothers report that their children are better behaved and have better mental health.|$|E

40|$|Venous {{compliance}} {{reflects the}} mechanical {{properties of the}} vein wall. Clinical methods of measurement have not been validated by comparison with the accepted in vitro measurement. Despite this, clinical <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> vein <b>compliance</b> may {{have a series of}} useful applications: (1) to assess the progression of chronic venous insufficiency and the related hemodynamic forces acting on the saphenous vein wall; (2) to determine the suitability of the saphenous vein for replacement of an arterial conduit by testing its mechanical properties; and (3) to select the saphenous vein with preferable mechanical performance for coronary artery bypass. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the relationship between in vitro and two in vivo methods <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> measurement. <b>Compliance</b> <b>of</b> the saphenous vein was determined in 20 patients, using both an invasive and a noninvasive (A and B, respectively) method. Duplex scanning was used for diameter measurement. Venous pressure was derived either intravenously with a needle transducer, or noninvasively with limb length measurement. Patients underwent saphenous excision with further in vitro <b>compliance</b> measurement <b>of</b> the same vein segment (method C).

Design/methodology/approach – The survey is carried out through a structured questionnaire, arranged into several sections: general information on the definition and framework <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> risk, organizational structure, reporting, culture, purpose and tasks <b>of</b> the <b>compliance</b> staff, <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>compliance</b> staff performance and of the risk. The survey is mainly developed on two issues: organizational and risk assessment implications. Findings – It is found that many survey participants are responding positively to regulation developments, since there is a widespread recognition <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> as a key element for creating value and improving reputation.
