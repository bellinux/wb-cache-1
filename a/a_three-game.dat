5|$|On January 30, 2015, Frazier {{recorded}} his second triple-double {{of the season}} with 13 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists as he helped the Red Claws snap <b>a</b> <b>three-game</b> losing streak with a 104-92 win over the Canton Charge.

5|$|The {{regular season}} has been changed in almost every season that Asia League has been in operation. The first full season mirrors the two most recent seasons in which all teams play all other teams six times. With the number of teams {{changing}} from season to season {{in the first few}} years the league adjusted the schedule each year which often included an unbalanced schedule. Under the current schedule all teams make an away visit to each other team's home rink for <b>a</b> <b>three-game</b> series and also play <b>a</b> <b>three-game</b> series against that team at their own home rink. In order to minimize travel, teams traveling to other countries will stay there for two weeks and play two teams, except in the case of China who only has one team. Teams going to Japan will play against the Cranes and Eagles on the same trip as they are geographically close together, then in another trip play against the Free Blades and Ice Bucks.|$|E
5|$|The {{two teams}} played <b>a</b> <b>three-game</b> interleague series at Yankee Stadium in May 2009, with the Phillies winning {{two of the}} three games.

5|$|Carl Jaenisch {{had arrived}} {{too late for}} the tournament; Staunton convincingly won a match with him soon after (seven wins, one draw, and two losses). Later in 1851 Staunton played a match against Elijah Williams, who had won their {{play-off}} for third place in the London International tournament. Staunton won more games (six wins, three draws, and four losses) but lost the match because he had given Williams <b>a</b> <b>three-game</b> start.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, the Pirates {{became the}} first team to come back from <b>a</b> <b>three-game</b> to one deficit to defeat the Washington Senators and win the World Series. Pittsburgh's third and final World Series {{championship}} while they played at Forbes Field came in 1960. Bill Mazeroski hit the first home run to end a World Series and as of 2017, the only walk-off home run in World Series Game 7 history.|$|E
5|$|Journey was {{the last}} game made under <b>a</b> <b>three-game</b> {{contract}} between Thatgamecompany and Sony, the first two being Flow and Flower. Development of the game began in 2009, {{after the release of}} Thatgamecompany's previous title Flower. The 18-person development team for Journey was composed mainly of creators of the company's previous games; co-founder Jenova Chen was the creative director and Nick Clark returned as lead designer. Kellee Santiago, producer of Flow and Flower, did not reprise her duties, concentrating instead on her role as the company's president, and was replaced by Robin Hunicke.|$|E
50|$|The victory {{served as}} a sort of going-away party for the Giants, who now faced <b>a</b> rare <b>three-game</b> roadtrip {{for the first time since}} 1994.|$|R

5|$|Luongo {{kept pace}} {{statistically}} in 2007–08 with his previous season's work {{and continued to}} set significant marks, including <b>a</b> <b>three-game</b> shutout streak spanning 210:34 in late-November (breaking the Canucks' previous franchise record of 184:20 set by Ken Lockett in 1975). He was voted in as the 2008 NHL All-Star Game's Western Conference starting goalie {{for the second consecutive}} season, although he did not attend in order to be with his pregnant wife in Florida.|$|E
5|$|McLeod {{played in}} goal for <b>a</b> <b>three-game</b> series against Mexico from June 25 – July 6, 2002 {{following}} an under-19 training camp.

5000|$|May 29: Justin Verlander blanked the Boston Red Sox over 7.2 innings, as the Tigers ended <b>a</b> modest <b>three-game</b> {{losing streak}} with a 3-0 {{win in the}} second game of a doubleheader.|$|R
2500|$|Clemens {{greatest}} postseason failure came in {{the second}} inning of the final game of the 1990 ALCS against the Oakland Athletics, when he was ejected for arguing balls and strikes with umpire Terry Cooney, accentuating the <b>A's</b> <b>three-game</b> sweep of the Red Sox. He was suspended for the first five games of the [...] season and fined $10,000. Clemens had two other playoff no-decisions, in 1988 and 1995, both occurring while Boston was being swept. Clemens' overall postseason record with Boston was 1–2 with a 3.88 ERA, and 45 strikeouts and 19 walks in 56 innings.|$|R

She {{was selected}} {{to participate in a}} national team training camp in 2010, and captained the team at the Osaka Cup and the World Championships that year. In July, she played in <b>a</b> <b>three-game</b> test series against Germany.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{also worked}} {{occasionally}} as an umpire in significant games. One notable example {{was the final}} contest of <b>a</b> <b>three-game</b> series between all-star teams from Brooklyn and New York City, held on September 10, 1858, in Long Island. During the game, which the New York City all-stars won 29–18, Adams became the first umpire to use a new rule allowing for a strike to be called against a batter who did not swing at a pitch in the strike zone. Previously, strikes were only called when a batter swung at a pitch and missed. Three batters were ruled out on strikes called by Adams in the game. Otherwise, the called strike rule was not applied often in its {{first few years of}} existence.|$|E
5|$|Before {{his first}} {{practice}} with Al-Nasr, Owumi became nauseated from food poisoning and was hospitalized. He {{moved into a}} luxurious apartment {{in the center of}} Benghazi owned by Mutassim Gaddafi. Initially unaware, he later saw pictures of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and his family across the building and learned that Al-Nasr was owned by the Gaddafi family. Owumi began playing with Al-Nasr during <b>a</b> <b>three-game</b> losing streak, and his Libyan teammates had bruises and scratches, as they were beaten by security during such slumps. The team received millions of dollars in funding from the Gaddafi family and its home arena had been the site of Gaddafi's first public execution.|$|E
50|$|Hewett had <b>a</b> brief <b>three-game</b> spell {{with the}} Welsh {{regional}} team the Llanelli Scarlets during the 2004-05 Celtic League season {{then went on}} playing the same tournament for Edinburgh Rugby until 2007, his last year as professional.|$|R
50|$|In July 1991, O'Shaughnessy joined Exeter City for £10,000. After <b>a</b> disappointing <b>three-game</b> spell at St James Park under 1966 FIFA World Cup winner Alan Ball, {{which saw}} him sent off at Huddersfield Town, O'Shaughnessy joined Darlington in January 1992.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, Wong Choong Hann {{reached the}} World Championships finals. In <b>a</b> thrilling <b>three-game</b> match between the {{veterans}} (both {{he and his}} opponent were above 24 years old then), he eventually lost out to the champion from China, Xia Xuanze.|$|R
5|$|Chen is from Shanghai, {{where he}} earned a bachelor's degree in {{computer}} science with a minor in digital art and design. He then moved to the United States, where {{he earned a}} master's degree from the University of Southern California's Interactive Media Division. While there he created Cloud and Flow, and met fellow student Kellee Santiago. After a brief period at Maxis working on Spore, he founded Thatgamecompany with Santiago and became the company's creative director. The company signed <b>a</b> <b>three-game</b> deal with Sony Computer Entertainment, and has sold Flow, Flower, and Journey through the PlayStation Network.|$|E
5|$|During the 1998–99 season, All-Star guard Eddie Jones {{and center}} Elden Campbell were {{traded to the}} Charlotte Hornets. The team also {{acquired}} J. R. Reid, B. J. Armstrong, and Glen Rice. Head coach Del Harris was fired in February after <b>a</b> <b>three-game</b> losing streak and replaced on an interim basis by former Laker Kurt Rambis. The team finished 31–19 in the strike-shortened season, which was fourth in the Western Conference. The Lakers defeated Houston {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, but were swept by San Antonio in the next round. Game four of the series would be the last game ever played at the Great Western Forum.|$|E
5|$|Expectations for Schenn {{were high}} {{heading into the}} 2009–10 season. During {{training}} camp, Toronto Head Coach Ron Wilson named {{him as one of}} the team's top four defencemen. As the season progressed, however, Schenn's play was disappointing, and Wilson kept him out of the line-up for a game in October and again for <b>a</b> <b>three-game</b> stretch in December. Towards the end of the season, Schenn and some of his younger teammates improved their play. In a game against the Ottawa Senators, Schenn posted his first career two-goal game, helping him finish the season with new career-highs in goals (5) and points (17) in 79 games played.|$|E
50|$|In April 2005, Bowyer was in {{the media}} {{spotlight}} again after an on-pitch brawl with teammate Kieron Dyer in Newcastle United's Premiership match with Aston Villa. This resulted in a red card, plus <b>an</b> automatic <b>three-game</b> ban, for each player. The Football Association fined Bowyer £30,000 and imposed <b>an</b> additional <b>three-game</b> ban, and the club fined him six weeks' wages; Dyer was not fined as Bowyer was perceived to have thrown the first punch. In addition, Bowyer was charged by Northumbria Police {{in connection with the}} brawl with offences under section four of the Public Order Act. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of using threatening behaviour and was fined £600 and ordered to pay £1000 costs.|$|R

50|$|During {{his brief}} late-season trial with Kansas City, Schypinski had <b>a</b> stellar <b>three-game</b> {{series against the}} Chicago White Sox September 16-18, 1955, with six hits in 15 at bats and three runs scored; he also was errorless in the field as the A's {{starting}} shortstop.|$|R
5|$|On November 23, 1996, Jovanovski {{received}} <b>a</b> <b>three-game</b> suspension {{from the}} NHL without pay. In {{a game against}} the Dallas Stars the previous night, he illegally left the penalty box ready to fight any opposing players during a break in play. Later in the season, he suffered a knee injury during {{a game against the}} Edmonton Oilers in January 1997, sidelining him for several weeks. The following month, he was involved in an on-ice altercation with San Jose Sharks forward Bernie Nicholls, resulting in a two-game suspension and the maximum $1,000 fine for Nicholls for intent to injure. The accumulated injuries and suspensions caused Jovanovski to miss 21 games in his second NHL season. He scored seven goals and 23 points over 61 contests.|$|E
5|$|Rome {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free {{agent in the}} subsequent off-season and was signed by the Vancouver Canucks on July 1, 2009, to a one-way, one-year contract worth $550,000. He played {{the majority of the}} season with the Canucks, notching 4 assists in 49 games, while also appearing in 7 games with Vancouver's affiliate, the Manitoba Moose; he scored 6 goals and 7 points in the AHL. During <b>a</b> <b>three-game</b> stint with the Canucks that season, he played forward {{for the first time in}} his career.

5|$|The 1962 National League tie-breaker {{series was}} <b>a</b> <b>three-game</b> playoff series at the {{conclusion}} of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1962 regular season to determine the winner of the National League (NL) pennant. The games were played from October 1 to 3, 1962, between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants. The Giants won the series, two games to one. The first game took place at Candlestick Park and the second and third were played at Dodger Stadium. The playoff series was necessary after both teams finished the season with identical win–loss records of 101–61. The Dodgers won a coin flip late in the season, which gave them home field advantage for the series.|$|E
50|$|The men's tournament was {{introduced}} in 2001 with <b>a</b> six-team, <b>three-game</b> format. In 2006, the tournament was expanded to eight teams playing in a predetermined bracket.

40|$|This paper uses <b>a</b> <b>three-games</b> (or triadic) {{design to}} {{identify}} trusting and reciprocating behavior. A large literature on single-game trust and reciprocity experiments {{is based on}} the implicit assumption that subjects do not have altruistic or inequality-averse other-regarding preferences. Such experimental designs test compound hypotheses that include the hypothesis that other-regarding preferences do not affect behavior. In contrast, experiments with the triadic design do discriminate between transfers resulting from trust or reciprocity and transfers resulting from other-regarding preferences that are not conditional on the behavior of others. Decomposing trust from altruism and reciprocity from altruism or inequality aversion is critical to obtaining empirical information that can guide the process of constructing models that can increase the empirical validity of game theory...|$|R
