2500|$|According to his {{statements}} to police, Goetz checked {{the first two}} men {{to make sure that}} they had been [...] "taken care of," [...] then, seeing that the fourth man was now sitting down and seemed unhurt, said, [...] "You seem to be all right, here's another," [...] and fired <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> [...] That the fourth man, Cabey, was shot only once was a fact not made known to Goetz or his attorneys until shortly before the trial. One bullet missed, fragmenting on the steel cab wall behind Cabey. (The missed shot would also be the basis of a charge of reckless endangerment of other passengers.) ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the third}} day of the chase, Ahab sights Moby Dick at noon, and sharks appear, as well. Ahab lowers his boat for a final time, leaving Starbuck again on board. Moby Dick {{breaches}} and destroys two boats. Fedallah's corpse, still entangled in the fouled lines, is lashed to the whale's back, so Moby Dick {{turns out to be the}} hearse Fedallah prophesied. [...] "Possessed by all the fallen angels", Ahab plants his harpoon in the whale's flank. Moby Dick smites the whaleboat, tossing its men into the sea. Only Ishmael is unable to return to the boat. He is left behind in the sea, and so is the only crewman of the Pequod to survive the final encounter. The whale now fatally attacks the Pequod. Ahab then realizes that the destroyed ship is the hearse made of American wood in Fedallah's prophesy. The whale returns to Ahab, who stabs <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> The line loops around Ahab's neck, and as the stricken whale swims away, the captain is drawn with him out of sight. Queequeg's coffin comes to the surface, the only thing to escape the vortex when Pequod sank. For an entire day, Ishmael floats on it, and then the Rachel, still looking for its lost seamen, rescues him.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} {{conflicting}} reports about {{what may have}} led to the shootings. According to subsequent oral statements by Vang, one of the local hunters, Terry Willers, took the first shot at him from about 100 feet (30 m) away, and therefore the shootings were in self-defense. No shell casing was ever recovered from Willers' gun even though during the trial Hesebeck admitted to firing a single shot later during the incident when Vang, noticing that Hesebeck was still alive, fired <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> Hesebeck testified no shot was fired before Vang started shooting. Additional forensic analysis of Willers' gun was not performed by the local law enforcement. The statements of both Vang and Hesebeck state that Vang removed the scope from his rifle before firing his first shot. [...] Vang stated that race was a factor, alleging that during the verbal dispute, some of the local hunters yelled out racial slurs at him such as [...] "chink" [...] and [...] "gook". On the stand, Hesebeck admitted that Robert Crotteau had called Vang a [...] "Hmong a--hole". Hesebeck also admitted that he told law enforcement that Robert Crotteau had problems with trespassers in the past, specifically citing Hmong hunters, who often travel to Wisconsin from Minnesota to hunt. The term [...] "Mud Duck" [...] is often used in Western Wisconsin to refer to Minnesota residents, similar to [...] "Cheesehead" [...] being used to describe Wisconsin residents. Willers used this term to describe Chai Vang when he radioed back to the cabin. Though the term does not necessarily have a racial connotation, the defense argued that it did, {{due to the fact that}} Willers and the others did not know at the time that Vang was from Minnesota.|$|E
60|$|The {{expression}} {{upon his}} face, {{combined with the}} relief I felt <b>at</b> seeing <b>him</b> <b>again</b> safe and sound, {{was too much for}} my overwrought nerves.|$|R
60|$|Her {{surprise}} <b>at</b> meeting <b>him</b> <b>again</b> is {{a little}} unreasonable. She seems {{to be under the}} impression that because she has forgotten him, he is for all practical purposes dead.|$|R
60|$|Pendennyss, who {{had never}} {{forgotten}} the good will manifested to him by Mr. Benfield, met him {{with a look of}} pleasure, as he expressed his happiness <b>at</b> seeing <b>him</b> <b>again</b> in London.|$|R
60|$|Anthea looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>again,</b> with a spot {{of color}} in her cheek.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>again,</b> {{and now she}} {{was smiling}} wistfully through her tears.|$|E
60|$|I looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> Good is so overpoweringly frivolous. 'What is it?' I said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, you mean, it's {{just what}} they're {{supposed}} to do?" [...] She looked <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> flushed <b>again</b> now; with which, after another hesitation, [...] "Do young men tell?" [...] she asked.|$|R
60|$|She {{was looking}} pale and tired, but the colour {{came back to}} her cheeks as she held out her hand. There was no trace of embarrassment in her manner; only a frank {{pleasure}} <b>at</b> seeing <b>him</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>Again</b> Martin looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> angrily; and <b>again</b> {{his anger}} melted away {{in spite of}} himself.|$|R
60|$|She smiled <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>again,</b> almost pitying, {{then put}} her mouth lovingly on the burn.|$|E
60|$|I {{dropped my}} glance, browbeaten for an instant. Then I looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>again,</b> and smiled.|$|E
60|$|Castell looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>again,</b> {{and this}} time there were respect and affection in his glance.|$|E
60|$|So all {{the little}} demons came {{dragging}} so much silver and gold {{that it was something}} awful. Hans filled his bundle with gold and silver coins, put it on his neck, and tramped back to his master, who was scared beyond all measure <b>at</b> seeing <b>him</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|Instantly {{she began}} to speak. How glad she {{was that she had}} {{prepared}} herself to speak as she would have spoken to any other good friend! So she expressed her joy <b>at</b> seeing <b>him</b> <b>again,</b> well and successful after all these months of peril, toil, and anxiety, and they sat down near each other.|$|R
60|$|She glanced <b>at</b> <b>him</b> keenly <b>again.</b> I saw she had {{expected}} him to fake up some lame excuse for not joining us; and I fancied she was annoyed at his prompt acquiescence, which had done {{her out of the}} chance for a family disagreement. 'Oh, you'll come then?' she said, grudgingly.|$|R
60|$|His {{unravelling}} went on, but it nevertheless seemed {{coming to}} no end. She looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|She hid {{her face}} against his breast for an instant, and then looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>again,</b> gladly radiant.|$|E
60|$|Something {{compelling}} in his voice, {{the easy}} assurance {{with which he}} spoke, drew her to stare <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|That {{was about}} all the {{explanation}} Leland ever got, but in another moment or two the trooper, {{who seemed to be}} looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> curiously, spoke <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Bessie Alden looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{a moment}} <b>again.</b> [...] "You {{certainly}} speak {{very well to}} young ladies. But why don't you address the House?--isn't that what they call it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Raut glanced <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{and away}} <b>again.</b> [...] "At present your {{moonlight}} effect is hardly ripe," [...] he continued, looking upward. [...] "The moon is still smothered by {{the vestiges of}} daylight." ...|$|R
60|$|Something in {{his voice}} {{suggested}} that he was of the same mind still, but Laura glanced <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|She paused, {{appearing}} to seek for something. Failing {{to find it}} she looked up <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>again,</b> between scorn and intercession.|$|E
60|$|Austin {{struggled}} {{into his}} duck trousers, and Jefferson, whose face {{was also a}} little more pallid than usual, glanced <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes,” said Maccario, {{who stood}} up, “when it pleases him, and I {{think it is}} {{scarcely}} likely we shall sit <b>at</b> meat with <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> You will pledge a faithful comrade and a valiant soldier, without whom we might never have been the masters of Santa Marta.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr Richards coughed at this point, and {{appeared}} to be engaged in a severe conflict with an untractable crust, which caused Maryann to stop suddenly and look <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> But Larry <b>again</b> came to the rescue by saying-- ...|$|R
60|$|The shark {{caught sight}} of his opponent, and {{instantly}} rushed <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Ned <b>again</b> dived, just before the creature reached him; and, rising under him, inflicted some more stabs with the pike; then he again swam off, for {{he was in no}} slight fear that he might be struck by his friends on board ship, of whose missiles, indeed, he was more in dread than of the shark himself.|$|R
60|$|She merely glanced <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>again,</b> {{and again}} averted her eyes; but {{she might have}} spoken for an hour, and {{expressed}} less.|$|E
60|$|Dawes glanced <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>again,</b> {{with dark}} eyes that agreed with {{everything}} {{the other would}} say, perhaps a trifle dominated by him.|$|E
60|$|Zo, staring hard at him, got off his knee; {{retired to}} a little {{distance}} to think; and stood staring <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
50|$|Arriving {{at police}} headquarters, Valérian notices Croupachof's {{surprise}} <b>at</b> seeing <b>him</b> <b>again</b> and realises {{that it was}} he who warned Na'Zultra. Meeting with T'loc, Valérian asks why he has been sent on a useless mission since T'loc not only already knows that the aristopatrons have succumbed to the Scunindar virus but that he also has an antidote. Valérian points to the machine and asks to use it - he will protect himself from the virus by using T'loc's antidote.|$|R
50|$|Four years on, and Startsev {{is now a}} {{respected}} medical man, who owns a troika. Ekaterina returns to the town. She looks better than ever, and her groundless musical ambitions are left behind. Still, the naivety and freshness are gone. As the two meet, she eagerly tries to re-awaken his interest in her, but Startsev remains unresponsive. Now everything about the family irritates him and he is very glad he'd not married. Ignoring her insistent attempts <b>at</b> making <b>him</b> <b>again</b> regular visitor, he never sets foot in the Turkin's house again.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is an {{inference}} that I expected," [...] said Victoria. Then {{she lifted}} her head and looked <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>again</b> he could not read her expression, for a light burned in her eyes that made them impenetrable to him,--a light that seemed pitilessly to search out and reveal the dark places and the weak places within him which he himself had not known were there. Could there be another standard by which men and women were measured and judged? ...|$|R
