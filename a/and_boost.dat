40|$|Abstract. To improve weak {{classifiers}} bagging <b>and</b> <b>boosting</b> {{could be}} used. These techniques {{are based on}} combining classifiers. Usually, a simple majority vote or a weighted majority vote are used as combining rules in bagging <b>and</b> <b>boosting.</b> However, other combining rules such as mean, product and average are possible. In this paper, we study bagging <b>and</b> <b>boosting</b> in Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) {{and the role of}} combining rules in bagging <b>and</b> <b>boosting.</b> Simulation studies, carried out for two artificial data sets and one real data set, show that bagging <b>and</b> <b>boosting</b> might be useful in LDA: bagging for critical training sample sizes <b>and</b> <b>boosting</b> for large training sample sizes. In contrast to a common opinion, we demonstrate that the usefulness of boosting does not directly depend on the instability of a classifier. It is also shown that the choice of the combining rule may affect the performance of bagging <b>and</b> <b>boosting.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present an {{improvement}} of the precision of classification algorithm results. Two various approaches are known: bagging <b>and</b> <b>boosting.</b> This paper describes a set of experiments with bagging <b>and</b> <b>boosting</b> methods. Our use of these methods aims at classification algorithms generating decision trees. Results of performance tests focused {{on the use of}} the bagging <b>and</b> <b>boosting</b> methods in connection with binary decision trees are presented. The minimum number of decision trees, which enables an {{improvement of the}} classification performed by the bagging <b>and</b> <b>boosting</b> methods, was found. The tests were carried out using the Reuter’s 21578 collection of documents as well as documents from an Internet portal of TV broadcasting company Markíza. The comparison of our results on testing the bagging <b>and</b> <b>boosting</b> algorithms is presented. 1...|$|R

5|$|In 2006, in {{response}} to disastrously low agricultural harvests, Malawi began a programme of fertiliser subsidies, the Fertiliser Input Subsidy Program (FISP) that were designed to re-energise the land <b>and</b> <b>boost</b> crop production.

The FISP fertiliser subsidy programs ended with President Bingu wa Mutharika's death; the country quickly faced food shortages again, and farmers developed reluctance to purchase fertilisers and other agricultural inputs on the open markets that remained.|$|E
5|$|Battles are {{triggered}} {{when the}} player encounters an enemy in the overworld. Battles {{take place in}} a themed arena, using a version of the Active Time Battle system: each side is given a turn in which to perform an action such as attacking. Each side can also interrupt an opponent's action, prolonging their waiting time. At the end of battle, players are granted experience points, which raise their experience level <b>and</b> <b>boost</b> their maximum health and statistics, in addition to in-game currency. Players can form a three-strong party to fight monsters, explore and battle alone, or loan non-active player characters of a similar or lower experience level for a fee, which are then controlled in battle by the game's artificial intelligence. Any character can be loaned to three different people, and the loaned character keeps the experience points and gold that they have earned.|$|E

Different criteria are appropriate in different settings, and it is not always clear which criteria to use. A further complication is that learning methods that perform well on one criterion may not perform well on other criteria. For example, SVMs <b>and</b> <b>boosting</b> are designed to optimize accuracy, whereas neural nets typically optimize squared error or cross entropy.

5|$|Other factors {{thought to}} affect this species include {{predation}} by introduced mammals, such as cats and foxes, changes to water quality at breeding sites, herbicide use, {{and loss of}} habitat through the destruction of wetlands. The amphibian chytrid fungus appears to have led to {{at least some of}} the decline in numbers, but the relative importance of the various factors is unclear. The frogs may have become more susceptible to chytrid rather than the fungus being more common. The genetic pool of the frogs has been found to be relatively small, attributed to habitat destruction, which has confined the smaller groups of frogs to isolated pockets and increased the incidence of inbreeding. This has led to proposals for frog populations to be mixed by human intervention in an attempt to reduce negative genetic effects <b>and</b> <b>boost</b> survival rates.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{newly elected}} {{government}} in Greece revealed the falsification of its national budget data, {{and that its}} fiscal deficit for the year was 12.7% of GDP {{as opposed to the}} 3.7% espoused by the previous administration. This news alerted markets to the fact that Greece's deficit exceeded the eurozone's maximum of 3% outlined in the Economic and Monetary Union's Stability and Growth Pact. Investors concerned about a possible sovereign default rapidly sold Greek bonds. Given Greece's prior decision to embrace the euro as its currency, it no longer held monetary policy autonomy and could not intervene to depreciate a national currency to absorb the shock <b>and</b> <b>boost</b> competitiveness, as was the traditional solution to sudden capital flight. The crisis proved contagious when it spread to Portugal, Italy, and Spain (together with Greece these are collectively referred to as the PIGS). Ratings agencies downgraded these countries' debt instruments in 2010 which further increased the costliness of refinancing or repaying their national debts. The crisis continued to spread and soon grew into a European sovereign debt crisis which threatened economic recovery {{in the wake of the}} Great Recession. In tandem with the IMF, the European Union members assembled a €750 billion bailout for Greece and other afflicted nations. Additionally, the ECB pledged to purchase bonds from troubled eurozone nations in an effort to mitigate the risk of a banking system panic. The crisis is recognized by economists as highlighting the depth of financial integration in Europe, contrasted with the lack of fiscal integration and political unification necessary to prevent or decisively respond to crises. During the initial waves of the crisis, the public speculated that the turmoil could result in a disintegration of the eurozone and an abandonment of the euro. German Federal Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble called for the expulsion of offending countries from the eurozone. Now commonly referred to as the Eurozone crisis, it has been ongoing since 2009 and most recently began encompassing the 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Bayesian model {{averaging}} {{also known}} as the Bayes optimal classifier (BOC) is an ensemble technique used extensively in the statistics literature. However, compared to other ensemble techniques such as bagging <b>and</b> <b>boosting,</b> BOC is less known and rarely used in data mining. This is partly due to model averaging being perceived as being inefficient and because bagging <b>and</b> <b>boosting</b> consistently outperforms a single model, which raises the question: “Do we even need BOC in datamining?”. We show that {{the answer to this question}} is “yes ” by illustrating that several recent efficient model averaging approaches can significantly outperform bagging <b>and</b> <b>boosting</b> in realistic difficult situations such as extensive class label noise, sample selection bias and many-class problems. To our knowledge the insights that model averaging can outperform bagging <b>and</b> <b>boosting</b> in these situations has not been published in the machine learning, mining or statistical communities. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Bagging <b>and</b> <b>boosting</b> {{are among}} the most popular {{resampling}} ensemble methods that generate and combine a diversity of classifiers using the same learning algorithm for the base-classifiers. Boosting algorithms are considered stronger than bagging on noisefree data. However, there are strong empirical indications that bagging is much more robust than boosting in noisy settings. For this reason, in this work we built an ensemble using a voting methodology of bagging <b>and</b> <b>boosting</b> ensembles with 10 subclassifiers in each one. We performed a comparison with simple bagging <b>and</b> <b>boosting</b> ensembles with 25 sub-classifiers, as well as other well known combining methods, on standard benchmark datasets and the proposed technique was the most accurate...|$|R
