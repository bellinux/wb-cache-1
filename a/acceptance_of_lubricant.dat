40|$|Problem statement: In general, {{engine oil}} is usually changed {{as defined by}} car or {{lubricant}} manufacturers, which is according to mileage. However, it was found from past researches that, at the predefined mileage or timeframe, most lubricant is still acceptably usable and efficient. Approach: This research aimed to calculate useful life <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> {{in order to reach}} its maximum usefulness. The method of study began by collecting data that indicates deterioration <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> by increasing mileage which includes total base number, viscosity, iron and flash point. Then the data was analyzed by means of Analysis Hierarchy Process (AHP). These variables were used to construct a model for calculating appropriate useful life <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> by using vector projection approach. It was found from this study that the defined mileage for changing lubricant, which is generally at 5, 000 km, is not appropriate. Results: Results of the study suggest that the most appropriate mileage for change <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> is at 12, 000 km.

40|$|This {{preliminary}} {{study on the}} maintenance <b>of</b> industrial <b>lubricants</b> for chemical plant investigated appropriate maintenance through condition monitoring <b>of</b> the <b>lubricants,</b> in particular autoxidation of base oil as the major degradation process. Changes in chemical and physical properties caused by the autoxidation of hydrocarbons were considered in terms of reaction sequence. The roles of antioxidants for maintaining the quality <b>of</b> <b>lubricants</b> were also considered. The reaction mechanism suggested the importance <b>of</b> antioxidants in <b>lubricants</b> during service. Therefore, a new method to diagnose consumption of antioxidant was required. Organic peroxides are reactive species generated during the autoxidation of hydrocarbons at the initial stage and can be quantitatively analyzed by iodometric titration. The peroxide value (POV) is proposed as a new parameter to monitor conditions <b>of</b> <b>lubricants.</b> The POV trace was examined by a model oxidation test <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> in the laboratory. Subdivided addition <b>of</b> antioxidants to <b>lubricant</b> before an increase in POV was found to prolong the lifetime <b>of</b> the <b>lubricants.</b> POV in lubricants for compressors in chemical plant was monitored during the regular maintenance process for two years. Increased POV was observed during machine operation. Oil refill reduced the POV <b>of</b> the <b>lubricant</b> to some extent. Changes in total acid number (TAN) <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> were closely related to change in POV, whereas other parameters such as viscosity, insoluble contaminants and water contaminants seemed independent {{of the changes in}} POV.
