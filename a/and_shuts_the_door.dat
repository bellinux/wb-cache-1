2500|$|Andrew first {{appears in}} the [...] "Pilot" [...] of season one. His first {{speaking}} role is arguing with his mother, Bree, over her desire for perfection. He is attached to his father, Rex, and is upset when Bree tries to cover up their impending divorce. When he confronts her about her lies after she discovers he lied to her, she says, [...] "Just because I chose not to share my marital problems with you does not give {{you the right to}} be rude!": and Andrew replies, [...] "How about driving my father away? Do I get to be rude then?", <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in her face. Andrew repeatedly breaks the rules during Season 1, infuriating Bree, who eventually humiliates him by turning up at the strip club he is visiting with his friends while grounded. Bree does later apologize to Andrew (who also admits how much he misses his father) for lying to him, but removes the door to his room in punishment for him smoking marijuana.|$|E

60|$|With these words, {{spoken in}} {{an unusually high}} tone for him, the lawyer goes into his rooms <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with a thundering noise.|$|E
6000|$|... "What was {{the name}} of the ship?" [...] he asked, in despair. [...] "Kan--Kon--Conger-eel," [...] replies the girl in triumph, <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in his face.|$|E
60|$|He {{said good}} night <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> In {{a moment he}} reappeared.|$|R

60|$|The clerk came in, <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> after him, {{with great}} mystery.|$|R
60|$|The lady comes in. Emmy {{goes out}} <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Ridgeon, who {{has put on}} an impenetrable and rather distant {{professional}} manner, turns to the lady, and invites her, by a gesture, to {{sit down on the}} couch.|$|E
60|$|MACAIRE. Mark well. (The MARQUIS {{opens the}} door of Number Thirteen, and the rest, {{clustering}} round, bid him good-night. As they begin to disperse along the gallery he enters <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.)</b> Out, out, brief candle! That man is doomed.|$|E
60|$|Everybody urges {{him not to}} be reckless, but he {{persists}} in his foolhardiness, and goes up to the Yellow Chamber (or whatever colour the haunted room may be) with a light heart and a candle, and wishes them all good-night, <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|Anne {{looked at}} Marilla, who {{followed}} her into <b>the</b> pantry <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> cautiously.|$|R
60|$|I {{turned to}} go up to my sitting-room. Harold came after me <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{went into}} her own room <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> without a word or a look.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{one night}} {{they decided to}} run her away. A crowd {{of men and women}} drove her out of her house, and chased her with sticks and stones.

6000|$|After a moment's {{hesitation}} TWISDEN nods, and GRAVITER goes out. [...] The three wait {{in silence}} {{with their eyes}} fixed on the door, the [...] GENERAL sitting at the table, TWISDEN by his chair, DANCY between [...] him and the door Right.

6000|$|... "He {{comes in}} <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Down {{he sits in}} that chair. 'I come to torment you!' he says, 'you Old Sumpthing!' and begins at me.... No human being could ever have been called such things before. It made me cry out. 'And now,' he says, 'just to show I ain't afraid of 'urting you,' he says, and ups and twists my wrist." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{then took}} Gerda's {{hand and led}} her into <b>the</b> little house <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R

6000|$|LIEUTENANT. That {{accounts}} for it. (He kisses her hand.) A thousand pardons.

(Taking his cap, gloves, and whip {{from the table and}} going.) You'll excuse my leaving you, General, I hope. Very sorry, I'm sure. (He talks himself out of the room.

60|$|There is much shaking of hands, {{and much}} bowing, {{and a great}} desire {{on the part of}} each young gentleman to take Toots down in Miss Dombey's good graces; and then, Mr Toots having {{bestowed}} a chuckle on his old desk, Florence and he withdraw with Mrs Blimber and Cornelia; and Doctor Blimber is heard to observe behind them as he comes out last, <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> 'Gentlemen, we will now resume our studies,' For that and little else is what the Doctor hears the sea say, or has heard it saying all his life.|$|E
6000|$|... (She {{goes out}} <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to the porch. Eileen gives a [...] frightened gasp and struggles {{up in bed}} {{as if she wanted}} to call [...] the nurse to return. Then she lies back in a state of great [...] nervous excitement, {{twisting}} her head with eager, fearful glances [...] towards the door, listening, clasping and unclasping her thin [...] fingers on the white spread. As Miss Howard walks across the [...] room to the hall door, it is opened and Stephen Murray enters. [...] A great change is visible in his face. It is much thinner and the [...] former healthy tan has faded to a sallow pallor. Puffy shadows of [...] sleeplessness and dissipation are marked under his heavy-lidded [...] eyes. He is dressed in a well-fitting, expensive dark suit, a [...] white shirt with a soft collar and bright-coloured tie.) ...|$|E

6000|$|CHRIS--[Despondently.] All right, Ay tal him. [ANNA {{goes out}} the doorway on rear. CHRIS follows {{her out and}} stands on the deck outside for a moment looking after her. Then he comes back inside <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> He stands looking out of the window--mutters--"Dirty die davil, you." [...] Then {{he goes to the}} table, sets the cloth {{straight}} mechanically, picks up the newspaper ANNA has let fall to the floor and sits down in the rocking-chair. He stares at the paper for a while, then puts it on table, holds {{his head in his hands}} and sighs drearily. The noise of a man's heavy footsteps comes from the deck outside and there is a loud knock on the door. CHRIS starts, makes a move as if to get up and go to the door, then thinks better of it and sits still. The knock is repeated--then as no answer comes, the door is flung open and MAT BURKE appears. CHRIS scowls at the intruder and his hand instinctively goes back to the sheath knife on his hip. BURKE is dressed up--wears a cheap blue suit, a striped cotton shirt with a black tie, and black shoes newly shined. His face is beaming with good humor.] ...|$|E
6000|$|So fared it with Chevalier de Court, {{early in}} the day; not without noise; not without commentaries. And now this {{continually}} increasing multitude at nightfall? Have they daggers too? Alas, with them too, after angry parleyings, there has begun a groping and a rummaging; all men in black, spite of their Tickets of Entry, are clutched by the collar, and groped. Scandalous to think of; for always, as the dirk, sword-cane, pistol, or were it but tailor's bodkin, is found on him, and with loud scorn drawn forth from him, he, the hapless man in black, is flung all too rapidly down stairs. Flung; and ignominiously descends, head foremost; accelerated by ignominious shovings from sentry after sentry; nay, as is written, by smitings, twitchings,--spurnings, a posteriori, not to be named. In this accelerated way, emerges, uncertain which end uppermost, man after man in black, through all issues, into the Tuileries Garden. Emerges, alas, {{into the arms of}} an indignant multitude, now gathered and gathering there, in the hour of dusk, to see what is toward, and whether the Hereditary Representative is carried off or not. Hapless men in black; at last convicted of poniards made to order; convicted 'Chevaliers of the Poniard!' Within is as the burning ship; without is as the deep sea. Within is no help; his Majesty, looking forth, one moment, from his interior sanctuaries, coldly bids all visitors 'give up their weapons;' <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> again. The weapons given up form a heap: the convicted Chevaliers of the poniard keep descending pellmell, with impetuous velocity; and at the bottom of all staircases, the mixed multitude receives them, hustles, buffets, chases and disperses them. (Hist. Parl. ix. 139-48.) ...|$|E
60|$|The {{theatrical}} young gentleman {{is a great}} {{advocate for}} violence of emotion and redundancy of action. If a father has to curse a child upon the stage, he likes to see it done in the thorough-going style, with no mistake about it: to which end {{it is essential that}} the child should follow the father on her knees, and be knocked violently over on her face by the old gentleman as he goes into a small cottage, <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind him. He likes to see a blessing invoked upon the young lady, when the old gentleman repents, with equal earnestness, and accompanied by the usual conventional forms, which consist of the old gentleman looking anxiously up into the clouds, as if to see whether it rains, and then spreading an imaginary tablecloth in the air over the young lady's head-soft music playing all the while. Upon these, and other points of a similar kind, the theatrical young gentleman is a great critic indeed. He is likewise very acute in judging of natural expressions of the passions, and knows precisely the frown, wink, nod, or leer, which stands for any one of them, or the means by which it may be converted into any other: as jealousy, with a good stamp of the right foot, becomes anger; or wildness, with the hands clasped before the throat, instead of tearing the wig, is passionate love. If you venture to express a doubt of the accuracy of any of these portraitures, the theatrical young gentleman assures you, with a haughty smile, that it always has been done in that way, and he supposes {{they are not going to}} change it at this time of day to please you; to which, of course, you meekly reply that you suppose not.|$|E
60|$|Kathleen, {{seeing this}} blood-stained giant in such violent action, {{naturally}} fled to her cabin <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{went out}} <b>and</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind me, <b>and</b> stood and thanked God {{from the bottom}} of my heart.|$|R
