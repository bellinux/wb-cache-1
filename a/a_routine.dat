The depth of <b>a</b> <b>routine's</b> lexical nesting is a known constant, so the size of <b>a</b> <b>routine's</b> display is fixed. Also, the number of containing scopes to traverse is known, the index into the display is also fixed. Usually <b>a</b> <b>routine's</b> display is located in its own stack frame, but the Burroughs B6500 implemented such a display in hardware which supported up to 32 levels of static nesting.|$|R

40|$|The Diploma thesis, titled The Role of Women Educators in the Social Development of Children in <b>a</b> Daily <b>Routine,</b> {{emphasizes}} {{and describes}} {{the role of}} women educators in managing of <b>a</b> daily <b>routine.</b> It also mentions the influence of women educators on the social development of children through <b>a</b> daily <b>routine.</b> The research was conducted in kindergartens in Ljubljana and in the Styrian region. The objective of the research was to compare {{the role of women}} educators in <b>a</b> daily <b>routine</b> and the influence of the factors of <b>a</b> daily <b>routine</b> on the social development of children in the urban and rural environments. The methodology is based on the descriptive research and causal-non-experimental methods. The questionnaire consists of questions of closed and open type. The study shows that women educators from the rural and urban environment are united in the opinion that they {{have a major impact on}} the social development of children in <b>a</b> daily <b>routine.</b> To encourage children's social development in <b>a</b> daily <b>routine,</b> the women educators from the urban environment most often use play, while the ones in the rural environment mostly use the conversation. As the most common way to encourage children to participate in <b>a</b> daily <b>routine</b> the women educators in the urban as well as the ones in the rural environment alleged verbal encouragement and providing a good example. They also agree that in carrying out their daily routines the transition from one activity to another represents the biggest issue. ...|$|R

5|$|After initial cutting, {{the diamond}} is shaped in {{numerous}} stages of polishing. Unlike cutting, {{which is a}} responsible but quick operation, polishing removes material by gradual erosion and is extremely time consuming. The associated technique is well developed; it is considered as <b>a</b> <b>routine</b> and can be performed by technicians. After polishing, the diamond is reexamined for possible flaws, either remaining or induced by the process. Those flaws are concealed through various diamond enhancement techniques, such as repolishing, crack filling, or clever arrangement of the stone in the jewelry. Remaining non-diamond inclusions are removed through laser drilling and filling of the voids produced.|$|E
