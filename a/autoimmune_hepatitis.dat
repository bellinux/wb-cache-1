5|$|In {{clinical}} immunology, {{levels of}} individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by nephelometry (or turbidimetry) {{to characterize the}} antibody profile of patient. Elevations in different classes of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of liver damage in patients for whom the diagnosis is unclear. For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic cirrhosis, elevated IgM indicates viral hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, while IgG is elevated in viral hepatitis, <b>autoimmune</b> <b>hepatitis</b> and cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{stages of the}} disease, the biopsy {{typically}} shows steatosis (deposition of fatty material), increased glycogen in the nucleus, and areas of necrosis (cell death). In more advanced disease, the changes observed are quite similar to those seen in <b>autoimmune</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> such as infiltration by inflammatory cells, piecemeal necrosis and fibrosis (scar tissue). In advanced disease, finally, cirrhosis is the main finding. In acute liver failure, degeneration of the liver cells and collapse of the liver tissue architecture is seen, typically on a background of cirrhotic changes. Histochemical methods for detecting copper are inconsistent and unreliable, and taken alone are regarded as insufficient to establish a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Serum copper is low, {{which may}} seem {{paradoxical}} given that Wilson's {{disease is a}} disease of copper excess. However, 95% of plasma copper is carried by ceruloplasmin which is often low in Wilson's disease. Urine copper is elevated in Wilson's disease and is collected for 24 hours in a bottle with a copper-free liner. Levels above 100 μg/24h (1.6 μmol/24h) confirm Wilson's disease, and levels above 40 μg/24h (0.6 μmol/24h) are strongly indicative. High urine copper levels are not unique to Wilson's disease; they are sometimes observed in <b>autoimmune</b> <b>hepatitis</b> and in cholestasis (any disease obstructing the flow of bile from the liver to the small bowel).|$|E
40|$|Antinuclear {{antibodies}} {{with the}} homogeneous pattern (ANA-H) and {{smooth muscle antibodies}} with antiactin specificity (SMA-AA) are regarded as the serum markers of type- 1 <b>autoimmune</b> chronic <b>hepatitis.</b> Their diagnostic relevance, however, has been questioned recently after the detection of signs of hepatitis C virus infection in <b>autoimmune</b> chronic <b>hepatitis</b> patients. To further evaluate this point, antihepatitis C virus antibodies were sought by two second generation assays (ELISA 2 and RIBA 2) in 100 Italian patients with chronic liver disease of unknown aetiology, including 46 with (<b>autoimmune</b> chronic <b>hepatitis)</b> and 54 without the above antibodies (cryptogenic). By ELISA 2, antihepatitis C virus, although significantly prevalent in cryptogenic (83 %), were found also in a substantial proportion of <b>autoimmune</b> chronic <b>hepatitis</b> patients (46 %) (p < 0. 0001), their occurrence was confirmed by RIBA 2 in almost all cases (96 % and 86 %, respectively). Autoimmune patients with either ANA-H or SMA-AA exhibited similar antihepatitis C virus prevalences (59 % and 52 %, respectively); by contrast, the eight cases positive for both the autoantibodies were consistently antihepatitis C virus negative. These findings confirm that in countries with high hepatitis C virus circulation (like Italy) an overlap between <b>autoimmune</b> chronic <b>hepatitis</b> and hepatitis C virus infection, reflected by 'true' antihepatitis C virus antibodies, does occur. The detection of ANA-H or SMA-AA, in fact, identifies chronic liver disease patients with a relatively low prevalence of antihepatitis C virus, but does not exclude hepatitis C virus infection. Positive findings for both ANA-H and SMA-AA, however, is an appropriate marker for hepatitis C virus free 'primary' <b>autoimmune</b> chronic <b>hepatitis...</b>|$|R
50|$|Primary {{polydipsia}} describes excessive thirst {{and water}} intake caused {{in the absence}} of physiological stimuli to drink. This includes both psychogenic primary polydipsia and non-psychogenic primary polydipsia, such as in patients with <b>autoimmune</b> chronic <b>hepatitis</b> with severely elevated globulin levels.|$|R
40|$|A {{positive}} {{family history}} of autoimmune disease is common among patients with <b>autoimmune</b> chronic active <b>hepatitis,</b> but usually autoimmunity is directed at organs other than the liver. We document {{for the first time}} the multiple occurrence of <b>autoimmune</b> chronic active <b>hepatitis</b> in a family. Out of a sibship of seven, three sisters developed this, one sister developed coeliac and autoimmune thyroid disease, one sister showed serological signs of autoimmunity, while the two brothers were well with no signs of autoimmunity. HLA typing showed that in association with the female sex DR 3 seems to be more important than B 8 in conferring susceptibility to <b>autoimmune</b> chronic active <b>hepatitis,</b> at least in this family...|$|R
25|$|Many {{people with}} <b>{{autoimmune}}</b> <b>hepatitis</b> have other autoimmune diseases. <b>Autoimmune</b> <b>hepatitis</b> {{is distinct from}} the other autoimmune diseases of the liver: primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. However, all of these diseases can lead to scarring, fibrosis, and cirrhosis of the liver.|$|E
25|$|<b>Autoimmune</b> <b>hepatitis</b> is {{a chronic}} disease {{caused by an}} {{abnormal}} immune response against liver cells. The disease {{is thought to have}} a genetic predisposition as it is associated with certain human leukocyte antigens involved in the immune response. As in other autoimmune diseases, circulating auto-antibodies may be present and are helpful in diagnosis. Auto-antibodies found in patients with <b>autoimmune</b> <b>hepatitis</b> include the sensitive but less specific anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibody (SMA), and atypical perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA). Other autoantibodies that are less common but more specific to <b>autoimmune</b> <b>hepatitis</b> are the antibodies against liver kidney microsome 1 (LKM1) and soluble liver antigen (SLA). <b>Autoimmune</b> <b>hepatitis</b> can also be triggered by drugs (such as nitrofurantoin, hydralazine, and methyldopa), after liver transplant, or by viruses (such as hepatitis A, Epstein-Barr virus, or measles).|$|E
25|$|<b>Autoimmune</b> <b>hepatitis</b> {{can present}} {{anywhere}} within the spectrum from asymptomatic to acute or chronic hepatitis to fulminant liver failure. Patients are asymptomatic 25–34% of the time, and {{the diagnosis is}} suspected {{on the basis of}} abnormal liver function tests. Up to 40% of cases present with signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis. As with other autoimmune diseases, <b>autoimmune</b> <b>hepatitis</b> usually affects young women (though it can affect patients of either sex of any age), and patients can exhibit classic signs and symptoms of autoimmunity such as fatigue, anemia, anorexia, amenorrhea, acne, arthritis, pleurisy, thyroiditis, ulcerative colitis, nephritis, and maculopapular rash. <b>Autoimmune</b> <b>hepatitis</b> increases the risk for cirrhosis, and the risk for liver cancer is increased by about 1% for each year of the disease.|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{has been}} shown to induce anti-liver-kidney microsomal- 1 (LKM 1) {{antibody}} positive chronic active hepatitis, simulating type 2 <b>autoimmune</b> chronic active <b>hepatitis.</b> The cases of five patients presenting with features of type 1 (antinuclear antibody positive) <b>autoimmune</b> chronic active <b>hepatitis</b> and extrahepatic <b>autoimmune</b> manifestations, in whom immunosuppressive treatment had no effect on liver disease are presented. In these patients, HCV infection could be shown by the presence in serum of anti-HCV antibodies and HCV-RNA detected by polymerase chain reaction. These cases suggest the following: (a) chronic HCV infection can mimic type 1, as well as type 2, autoimmune chronic active hepatitis; (b) HCV infection might be systematically sought in patients presenting with features of type 1 <b>autoimmune</b> chronic active <b>hepatitis,</b> with special care in patients who are unresponsive to immunosuppressive treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} from a characteristic picture of <b>autoimmune</b> chronic <b>hepatitis</b> type I to primary biliary cirrhosis is {{reported in a}} middle-aged woman. The initial diagnosis of autoimmune chronic liver disease was based on clinical, bio-serological and histological grounds. It was further confirmed by complete remission following immunosuppressive treatment and prompt relapses {{at the time of}} therapy withdrawal. After 7 years, the characteristics of liver disease were altered with increased biochemical cholestasis and serum IgM concentrations, positivation of previously negative anti-M 2 antimitochondrial antibodies and the appearance of a typical histological picture of stage I primary biliary cirrhosis. We believe {{that this is the first}} reported case in which <b>autoimmune</b> chronic <b>hepatitis</b> highly responsive to immunosuppressive therapy has been followed by the development of a characteristic picture of primary biliary cirrhosis...|$|R
40|$|In 18 {{cases of}} chronic liver disease due to non-A, non-B {{hepatitis}} virus(es) {{in which the}} diagnosis was established by transmission, including chimpanzee inoculation in nine, sera were tested for the autoantibodies characteristically associated with <b>autoimmune</b> chronic active <b>hepatitis.</b> The frequency of autoantibodies to nuclear, smooth muscle, cytofilament, mitochondrial and liver membrane antigens was low, being not greater than that recorded for a normal population, and the few positive reactions obtained were at very low titre. These findings suggest that among cases of 'HBsAg negative' chronic hepatitis, those due to NANB infection are distinguishable from those due to <b>autoimmune</b> chronic <b>hepatitis</b> by negative serological tests for autoantibodies...|$|R

40|$|Children with {{uncontrolled}} <b>autoimmune</b> chronic active <b>hepatitis</b> {{have increased}} numbers of activated T lymphocytes expressing interleukin 2 receptors (IL 2 R). A soluble form of IL 2 R {{has recently been}} described whose proposed role is to downregulate T cell activation by competing for interleukin 2. We investigated whether a deficiency of soluble IL 2 R {{could account for the}} high concentrations of IL 2 R positive T lymphocytes in <b>autoimmune</b> chronic active <b>hepatitis.</b> Soluble IL 2 R was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the serum of 16 children with <b>autoimmune</b> chronic active <b>hepatitis,</b> eight with chronic liver disease due to hepatitis B virus infection, seven with Wilson's disease, nine with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, and 15 healthy age matched controls. Soluble IL 2 R concentration was significantly higher in patients with <b>autoimmune</b> chronic active <b>hepatitis</b> than in healthy controls (mean (SEM) 475 (75) U/ml, 145 (8) U/ml respectively, p less than 0. 01). Eleven patients who had active disease had significantly higher soluble IL 2 R concentrations (590 (89) U/ml) than the five cases with inactive disease (220 (36) U/ml, p less than 0. 01). No difference was found between the controls and the patients with chronic liver disease due to hepatitis B infection, Wilson's disease, and alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency. Percentages and absolute numbers of surface IL 2 R positive T cells as detected by immunofluorescence were significantly higher in the patients with <b>autoimmune</b> chronic active <b>hepatitis</b> (11. 8 % (1); 274 /microliters (31)) than in controls (0. 2 % (0. 1); 5 /microliters (2), p less than 0. 001), the highest values being found in those with uncontrolled disease. A significantly positive correlation was observed between concentrations of soluble IL 2 R and the percentage of T cells expressing IL 2 receptors (r= 0. 67, p< 0. 001). These results indicate that the high levels of IL 2 R positive T lymphocytes characteristic of <b>autoimmune</b> chronic active <b>hepatitis</b> are not due to a deficiency of soluble IL 2 receptors...|$|R
40|$|Autoimmunity and viral {{infections are}} closely {{associated}} fields, and viruses {{have been proposed}} as a likely aetiological, contributory or triggering factors of systemic <b>autoimmune</b> diseases. <b>Hepatitis</b> C virus {{seems to be the}} virus usually associated with the appearance of autoimmune diseases, and the relationship between chronic hepatitis C virus infection and some autoimmune disease has been studied. For some of these disorders their association with hepatitis C virus infection is well recognized while for others it remains probable or weak. Examples of autoimmune phenomena observed in chronic hepatitis C virus infection include rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease, cryoglobulinaemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, systemic lupus erythematosus and sjogren syndrome.

40|$|The portal tract {{mononuclear}} cell infiltrate has been characterised in 28 liver biopsy samples showing features of chronic aggressive hepatitis from 12 patients with <b>autoimmune</b> chronic active <b>hepatitis,</b> 12 with primary sclerosing cholangitis, and four with other chronic liver diseases (two with alpha 1 -antitrypsin deficiency, one with Wilson's disease, {{and one with}} chronic hepatitis B infection). In all patients liver disease had started in childhood. The {{mononuclear cell}} infiltrate was investigated by a two step immunoperoxidase technique using monoclonal antibodies to: total, alpha/beta T cell receptor positive, helper/inducer, suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocytes; B lymphocytes; killer/natural killer cells; monocyte/macrophages; and to the activation markers HLA-DR antigens, interleukin 2 receptor (IL- 2 R), transferrin receptor, and 4 F 2 Ag. In all samples the infiltrate consisted of mainly alpha/beta T cell receptor T lymphocytes. Although T helper/inducer cells predominated in patients with <b>autoimmune</b> chronic active <b>hepatitis,</b> T suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocytes were preponderant in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and the other chronic liver diseases. Killer/natural killer cells accounted for up to 25 % of the mononuclear cell infiltrate in patients with <b>autoimmune</b> chronic active <b>hepatitis,</b> being rare or absent in the other diseases. Monocytes/macrophages were always found, but they were more numerous in primary sclerosing cholangitis than in the other chronic liver diseases. B lymphocytes were rare or absent in all subjects. Activated mononuclear cells were present in all subjects, but although in patients with <b>autoimmune</b> chronic active <b>hepatitis</b> and primary sclerosing cholangitis most cells of the infiltrate expressed HLA-DR antigens and up to 75 % IL- 2 R, in other forms of chronic liver diseases HLA-DR positive cells were less common and IL- 2 R positive cells ere rare or absent.
