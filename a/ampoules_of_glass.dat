40|$|Glass {{ampoules}} {{have been}} widely used in packaging injection drugs. Glass has important characteristics that allow it to be widely used in fabrication of recipients for drugs and other sterile substances. However, contamination <b>of</b> solutions with <b>glass</b> microparti-cles on breaking open <b>glass</b> <b>ampoules,</b> the presence <b>of</b> metals, percutaneous injury, and biological contamination justify the need of educational materials to orient the manipulation <b>of</b> <b>ampoules.</b> Contents: <b>Glass</b> microparticles generated in the snap-opening <b>of</b> <b>ampoules,</b> as well as metals that contaminate their contents can be aspirated and injected through several routes.

40|$|The {{effect of}} thermal {{convection}} on {{the shape of}} solid-liquid interface was investigated in experiments conducted in a transparent Bridgman-type directional solidification furnace. The relationship was numerically modeled using a standard 2 D finite-difference approach, with the solid-liquid deformable interface approximated by a blocking-off technique. The directional solidification furnace was used with pure succinonitrile (which is also transparent) contained in a long square <b>ampoule</b> made <b>of</b> borosilicate <b>glass.</b> With the furnace in the vertical configuration, a flat interface was observed, {{in agreement with the}} model. On the other hand, a highly distorted interface was obtained in the horizontal configuration; the numerical results showed a strong recirculating cell in front of the interface due to natural thermal convection. The results indicate that thermal convection is responsible for the interface distortion...|$|R

40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of thermal}} inactivation as affected by combined temperature and liquid pH for three vegetative bacteria— Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Listeria monocytogenes (SLCC 5764) and Pseudomonas fluorescens (172) — {{have been studied}} using published bench-scale data and additional experimentally determined data from the heating <b>of</b> samples in <b>ampoules</b> <b>of</b> thin-walled <b>glass.</b> These bacteria represent common micro-organisms known to grow in solid and liquid foods. Up to six levels of temperature (52, 54, 56, 58, 60 and 62 ° C) in combination with up to eight levels of pH (4. 0, 4. 5, 5. 0, 5. 5, 6. 0, 6. 5, 7. 0 and 7. 5) with exposure times ranging from 10 seconds to five minutes, were used in experimental designs to cover the wide biokinetic range of interest. The carrier liquid, a 2 kg m− 3 mucilage of Carbopol® 934 was selected because of the stability of its viscosity over the range of temperature and pH values, and its resistance to bacterial growth. The viscosity of this mucilage closely simulates that {{of a range of}} liquid foods. The effect of pH on the rate of thermal inactivation was significant for all three bacteria, especially at the lower exposure temperatures. However, because survivor data showed tailing with longer exposure times, the widely held assumption of first-order kinetics for thermal inactivation of vegetative bacteria is not supported. Concave-up tails appear in the data for P. fluorescens and E. coli and both concave-up and concave-down tails appear in the data for L. monocytogenes. Taken together, data for all three bacteria support the necessity for a model formulation for non-linear survivor kinetics as influenced by combined exposure temperature and liquid pH. J. Chiruta, K.

40|$|Eighty-seven {{patients}} undergoing {{in vitro}} fertilization were studied to evaluate the prognostic value of different tests in predicting ovarian stimulation response. We studied basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) value on cycle day 3, the clomiphene citrate (CC) challenge test and serum estradiol levels on cycle day 3. Patients with elevated basal FSH levels needed more <b>ampoules</b> <b>of</b> gonadotropins for stimulation and had a higher cancellation rate because of poor response. Patients with abnormal CC challenge test results also needed more <b>ampoules</b> <b>of</b> gonadotropins, but the higher cancellation rate in this group did not reach statistical significance. The basal estradiol level did not contribute to further discrimination between groups. We conclude that basal FSH level on cycle day 3 is a useful prognosticator of ovarian stimulation response.

40|$|The bioindustrial {{production}} strongly {{depends on}} the reliable microbial preservation in microBiological Resource Centres. The implementation of consistent microbial preservation techniques and appropriate quality assurance are key issues for an effective and efficient preservation and consequently industrial production. Though, the cost and convenience of each method are important aspects {{to be taken into}} consideration such as the knowledge of all parameters capable of affecting the procedures [1]. Preservation methods currently used are highly empirical and in many instances do not provide reliable genetic and phenotypic stability. There is an increasing in the adaptation of the existent methodologies to the specific strain to preserve. But there is also the need to understand the alterations after preservation. Freeze-drying is commonly used to preserve biological materials for long-term storage at room temperature and protectants are generally added to these materials to reduce damage during the freezing and drying processes. Therefore, the main goal of the present experimental study is to evaluate the freeze-drying preservation method for the effective long-term preservation of strains belonging to Aspergillus section Nigri. To perform this, twenty one strains representative of Aspergillus section Nigri were selected and preserved by freeze-drying. The strains were subjected to accelerated storage, equivalent to ageing, with two different time points (2 and 4 weeks of maintenance of the freeze-dried strains, in <b>ampoules</b> <b>of</b> borosilicate <b>glass,</b> at 37 ºC). These samples were morphological and physiological analysed. In addition, the genetic stability is under study applying molecular biology techniques. For all the methodologies used to evaluate freeze-drying of fungi along time the major conclusions so far are: 1) Minor differences were found but there were no significant changes observed in the macroscopic and microscopic analysis; 2) In the screening for aflatoxins, all strains maintained their pattern before and after ageing; 3) In the detection of ochratoxin-A (OTA), most of the OTA producing strains did not present significant changes after preservation and ageing; 4) In the fumonisins detection, it was possible to observe that some strains changed their profile along the procedures, but for most samples no production was detected after ageing. In conclusion, and so far, freeze-drying can be considered a technique of excellence to be used on the maintenance of biodiversity within the filamentous fungi, and more accurately for Aspergillus section Nigri.
