5|$|Ged is {{depicted}} as proud and yet unsure of himself in multiple situations: early in his apprenticeship he believes Ogion to be mocking him, and later, at Roke, feels put upon by Jasper. In both cases, he believes that others do not appreciate his greatness, and Le Guin's sympathetic narration does not immediately contradict this belief. Cadden writes that Le Guin allows young readers to sympathize with Ged, and only gradually {{realize that there is}} <b>a</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> be paid for his actions, as he learns to discipline his magical powers. Similarly, as Ged begins his apprenticeship with Ogion, he imagines that he will be taught mysterious aspects of wizardry, and has visions of transforming himself into other creatures, but gradually comes to see that Ogion's important lessons are those about his own self.|$|E

From this he becomes the new master of the shop and takes up Yūko's job of granting wishes to the shop's customers during the last volume from xxxHolic subtitled xxxHolic Rō. His personality changes as he adopts some of Yūko's quirks and habits. He works with help from Domeki who brings him materials from outside. Over the following years, Watanuki's powers become stronger since he retains his ability to see spirits. His lifespan also increases, though he has the appearance of a teenager. More than a hundred years after taking over the shop, Watanuki's powers grow strong enough to allow him to leave the shop, but he decides to remain there and continue to fulfill the promise he made to Yūko.|$|E

He stressed the relationship between the people and the land and saw a need for planning control to manage human ingress into areas that remained mostly untouched. [...] In 1934 he supported the Nature Lovers Association in their appeal to make the mountainous Snowdonia region, near the coast of North Wales, such an entity.

The video of [...] "Voyage" [...] depicts Hamasaki as {{a woman in a}} mental hospital whose previous incarnation was a woman in feudal Japan who was sacrificed to the moon; the video of [...] "Endless Sorrow" [...] features a young boy living in a society where speaking is forbidden by law. In the video for [...] "Free & Easy", Hamasaki portrayed a [...] "twenty-first-century Joan of Arc" [...] to convey her message [...] "freedom cannot be easily obtained; there is <b>a</b> <b>price</b> <b>to</b> pay for it" [...] and to express her opposition to her marrying at the time; the video for [...] "Ourselves" [...] featured masked people destroying [...] "effigies of [...] past" [...] such as photographs and album covers to symbolize destruction and rebirth.
