40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{reconstruct}} economic reasoning on entrepreneurship from the perspective of its institutional content, thus underlining the aspects of power relations and leadership, which are related with the organisational and technological dimensions of innovation and coordination as entrepreneurial functions. Design/methodology/approach – In reconstructing the theory of entrepreneurship in a range from classical political economy to current efforts in economic sociology, the paper focuses on an appreciation of Schumpeterian entrepreneurship as a concept that is influenced both by Austrian marginalism and the German historical school. Findings – The paper finds that the research perspective of economic sociology as a means for exploring the institutional foundations of entrepreneurship is of utmost relevance for further efforts in theorising the role of entrepreneurship in economic development. Practical implications – The paper promotes policy implications, which underline that policies for the support of entrepreneurship need to account for the differentiation of entrepreneurial functions and their <b>actual</b> <b>carriers,</b> reconsidering the economic manifestations of their institutional embeddedness. Originality/value – The paper establishes innovation and coordination as ideal types of entrepreneurial functions, perceiving them as fundamental concepts in economic reasoning on entrepreneurship in the process of economic development.

50|$|The two {{stations}} are synchronized as a single-frequency network, {{the same way}} a booster station would be. This means that the stations transmit the same audio at exactly the same time, intended to make for a nearly seamless transition for listeners. The main indication is static, most often occurring around southeastern Cobb county, near the Chattahoochee River and the northwestern part of the Perimeter (I-285 around Atlanta). This is due to the two stations being around the same signal strength in this area, and the numerous hills, which causes the relative levels of the two to rapidly oscillate back and forth (picket-fencing) when travelling at freeway speeds. Slower speeds or stationary listening may actually be more difficult, as the listener is stuck in small pockets of poor reception for longer periods. The zone of RF interference moves hourly and daily based on weather and overnight temperature inversions, which affect radio propagation, especially over the longer distance from the main station. The two stations may also have their <b>actual</b> <b>carrier</b> waves synchronized via GPS for further stability, and to avoid phase cancellation, but as a matter of physics it is impossible to avoid the switching caused by FM's capture effect.|$|E

Culex is not only abundant in Karachi but also widespread {{in other parts of}} Pakistan, causing such diseases as filariasis, and. Tahir et al.

40|$|AbstractThe light-biased dynamic {{analysis}} of excess carrier decay {{has been known}} to yield differential rather than actual recombination properties since 1995. This finding implies a mismatch between actual lifetime and the measured differential lifetime in the case of injection-dependent carrier lifetime. Therefore, a time-consuming integration of differential recombination properties over the entire injection range was deemed inevitable in order to obtain actual recombination properties from differential measurements. We recently observed a striking analogy to the above finding: Time-modulated luminescence measurements – notably without any additional constant bias light – feature a systematic mismatch between actual lifetime and apparent lifetime determined from the phase shift of carrier density with respect to carrier generation if lifetime is injection-dependent. This gave rise to rearrange previous findings in a quantitative theory of light-biased carrier decay, which also comprises time-modulated lifetime techniques without constant bias light. This theory directly relates measurable differential lifetime to <b>actual</b> <b>carrier</b> lifetime. It is applied in a new differential-to-actual (d 2 a) lifetime analysis, which allows the determination of <b>actual</b> <b>carrier</b> lifetime from differential measurements without integration over the entire injection range. In terms of practical relevance, the d 2 a approach brings about a drastic experimental simplification. Combined with the general advantages of dynamic lifetime techniques, it could upgrade differential carrier decay techniques and time-modulated lock-in techniques intopowerful quantitative characterization options in silicon photovoltaics. This paper provides an experimental proof ofconcept of the d 2 a technique based on harmonically time-modulated photoluminescence...|$|E
