500|$|The {{film was}} {{conceived}} {{as a result of}} the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which delayed the seventh season for an entire year; the producers were exploring ways to get back on the air earlier. Ideas included airing webisodes or mobisodes. According to the President of Entertainment at Fox, [...] "We were going to be off the air for a while and how do you bridge that gap. We thought <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> online and after talking with [...] Howard Gordon we decided to do it on air." [...] The working title for the film was 24: Exile, until the change to 24: Redemption.|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, Irwin {{described}} {{a late night}} conversation at a Waffle House that he had with Cyndi Craven (a friend, musician and Irwin's website designer):... and I was talking about what I have to tell myself {{all the time when}} I'm afraid <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> that hasn't been done before because it really is frightening to step out and do something different. So I will tell myself, [...] "Don’t be afraid to be amazing". Cyndi said, [...] "Where did you get that?" [...] I said, [...] "I made it up".

2500|$|The plan did {{not work}} because the four policemen did not come out of Sherritt's house until the morning. This meant that {{the news of the}} murder did not reach Melbourne as quickly as the Kelly Gang had hoped. The people held {{prisoner}} in the hotel became restless. Ned organised music and Dan joined in dancing to keep the people in the hotel entertained. Dan also organised some sporting games including long jump and hop, step and jump. Dan wanted to leave Glenrowan when they knew the plan was not going to work because the train was late. Ned Kelly let Thomas Curnow, the school master, go home to his wife. Dan told his brother not to [...] Curnow, and to keep him at the hotel. Curnow did go home, where he discussed with his wife <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something,</b> but after hearing the train approaching, he ran to the railway line with a lantern and his wife's red silk scarf and at about 3.00am he was able to stop the train before it reached the broken rails. The police quickly left the train and placed themselves around the hotel so that the Kelly Gang was trapped inside.|$|E

50|$|The Cyclops and Silenus drink together, with Silenus {{attempting}} to hog the wineskin for himself. When the Cyclops is drunk, {{he says he}} is seeing gods and begins to call Silenus Ganymede (the beautiful prince Zeus made his immortal cup bearer). The Cyclops then steals Silenus away into his cave, with the implication that he is <b>about</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> sexual to him. Odysseus decides to execute the next phase of his plan. The Satyrs initially offer to help, but later become afraid and offer a variety of absurd excuses when the time for action actually comes. The annoyed Odysseus gets his crew to help instead, and they burn out the Cyclops' eye.|$|R

60|$|My twenty-third {{year was}} to me an {{important}} era. Partly through whim, and partly that I wished to set <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> in life, I joined a flax-dresser in a neighbouring town (Irvine), to learn his trade. This was an unlucky affair. My partner was a scoundrel of the first water; and to finish the whole, as we were giving a welcome carousal to the New Year, the shop took fire and burnt to ashes, and I was left, like a true poet, not worth a sixpence.|$|E

"Why, you know, the Union Chapel, {{over in the}} village, is in a languishing condition, and {{the ladies}} have been talking all summer <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> for it, getting up something--a concert or theatricals or a dance or something--and {{applying}} the proceeds to repainting and papering the visible church; it needs it dreadfully.

6000|$|How miserable I was, when I lay down! How I {{thought and}} thought about my being poor, in Mr. Spenlow's eyes; about my not being what I thought I was, when I {{proposed}} to Dora; about the chivalrous necessity of telling Dora what my worldly condition was, and releasing her from her engagement if she thought fit; about how I should contrive to live, during the long term of my articles, when I was earning nothing; <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> to assist my aunt, and seeing no way of doing anything; about coming down to have no money in my pocket, and to wear a shabby coat, {{and to be able}} to carry Dora no little presents, and to ride no gallant greys, and to show myself in no agreeable light! Sordid and selfish as I knew it was, and as I tortured myself by knowing that it was, to let my mind run on my own distress so much, I was so devoted to Dora that I could not help it. I knew that it was base in me not to think more of my aunt, and less of myself; but, so far, selfishness was inseparable from Dora, and I could not put Dora on one side for any mortal creature. How exceedingly miserable I was, that night! ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{pushed my}} canoe through {{the fringe of}} water-grass on the point nearest the loons, they were {{scattered}} in a long line, twelve or fifteen of them, extending {{from the head of}} the bay to a point nearly opposite me. At {{the other end of the}} line two loons were swimming <b>about,</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> which I could not make out. Suddenly the loon talk ceased. There may have been a signal given, which I did not hear. Anyway, the two loons faced about at the same moment and came tearing down the line, using wings and feet to help in the race. The upper loons swung in behind them as they passed, so as to watch the finish better; but not a sound was heard till they passed my end of the line in a close, hard race, one scarcely a yard ahead of the other, when such a yelling began as I never heard before. All the loons gathered about the two swimmers; there was much cackling and crying, which grew gradually quieter; then they began to string out in another long line, and two more racers took their places at one end of it. By that time it was almost dark, and I broke up the race trying to get nearer in my canoe so as to watch things better. Twice since then I have heard from summer campers of their having seen loons racing across a lake. I have no doubt it is a frequent pastime with the birds when the summer cares for the young are ended, and autumn days are mellow, and fish are plenty, and there are long hours just for fun together, before Hukweem moves southward for the hard solitary winter life on the seacoast.|$|E
6000|$|March 10.--I had a {{world of}} trumpery to do this morning: cards to write, and {{business}} to transact, visits to make, etc. Received letters from the youth who is to conduct The Keepsake, with blarney on a £200 Bank note. No blarney in that. I must set <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> for these worthies. I was obliged to go alone to dine at Mr. Scott Gala's. Met the Sinclair family. Lady Sinclair told me a singular story of a decrepit man keeping a lonely toll {{at a place called}} the Rowan-tree, on the frontiers, as I understood, between Ayrshire and Dumfriesshire [Wigtownshire?]. It was a wild, lonely spot, and was formerly inhabited by robbers and assassins, who murdered passengers. They were discovered by a boy whom they had taken into the cottage as a menial. He had seen things which aroused his attention, and was finally enlightened as to the trade of his masters by hearing one of them, as he killed a goat, remark that the cries of the creature resembled those of the last man they had dealt with. The boy fled from the house, lodged an information, and the whole household was seized and executed. The present inhabitants Lady Sinclair described as interesting. The man's feet and legs had been frost-bitten while herding the cattle, and never recovered the strength of natural limbs. Yet he had acquired some education, and was a country schoolmaster for some time, till the distance and loneliness of the spot prevented pupils from attending. His daughter was a reader, and begged for some old magazines, newspapers, or any printed book, that she might enjoy reading. They might have been better had they been allowed to keep a cow. But if they had been in comfortable circumstances, they would have had visitors and lodgers, who might have carried guns to destroy the gentleman's creation, i.e. game; and for this risk the wretches were kept in absolute and abject poverty. I would rather be--himself than this brutal Earl. The daughter showed Lady Sinclair a well {{in the midst of a}} small bog, of great depth, into which, like Thurtell and Probert, they used to thrust the bodies of their victims till they had an opportunity of burying them. Lady Sinclair stooped to taste the water, but the young woman said, with a strong expression of horror, [...] "You would not drink it?" [...] Such an impression had the tale, probably two centuries old, made upon the present inhabitants of this melancholy spot. The whole legend is curious; I will try to get hold of it.[149] ...|$|E
