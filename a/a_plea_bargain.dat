In January 2011, he signed <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargain,</b> confessing to money {{laundering}} and receiving a 57-month jail sentence, which he had already served, and was ordered to serve three years under supervised release.

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining,</b> {{also called}} <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> {{agreement}} or negotiated <b>plea,</b> is <b>an</b> alternative and consensual way of criminal case settlement. <b>A</b> <b>plea</b> agreement means settlement of case without main hearing when the defendant agrees {{to plead guilty}} {{in exchange for a}} lesser charge or for a more lenient sentence and/or for dismissal of certain related charges. (Article 209 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Georgia) ...|$|R
25|$|In 1987, federal {{prosecutors}} obtained an indictment against Ford from {{a grand jury}} in eastern Tennessee. The indictment was based on testimony from two bankers convicted of bank fraud who had agreed in <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargains</b> to testify against Ford {{in return for a}} reduction in their sentences. The bankers had been convicted of bank fraud after their chain of banks collapsed in 1983.|$|R
5|$|Before {{the trial}} began, public defender Blane Williams had urged Bell to accept <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargain.</b> At trial he rested the defense case without calling any {{witnesses}} or offering any evidence. The {{six members of}} Bell's jury were all white. The 150-person jury pool included black citizens, who make up 10percent of the parish's population, {{but none of the}} 50potential jurors who showed up was black. Williams did not challenge the composition of the jury pool.|$|E
5|$|Cox faced 42 {{counts of}} fraud, in {{addition}} to felony charges for fleeing while on probation from a previous conviction. Facing potential prison sentences of over 400 years, he negotiated <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargain</b> agreement that gave him a maximum of 54 years, and a $2 million fine. On November 17, 2007, federal judge Timothy C. Batten, Sr. sentenced Cox to 26 years in prison. He also ordered Cox to pay $5.97 million in restitution. He will not be eligible for release until 2029.|$|E
5|$|Bissell {{was arrested}} in 1981 in Bloomington, Indiana, and charged with public intoxication, disorderly conduct and pushing a policeman. He was given a 30-day jail sentence, however <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargain</b> was made whereby the judge ordered him to arrange to give a {{performance}} at Indiana University with the proceeds {{to be given to}} charity. Bissell was also given a $100 fine. After being fired by the ABT (along with Gelsey Kirkland), they were re-hired and celebrated by doing a stash of cocaine they had smuggled in the lining of a ballet slipper.|$|E
25|$|On July 14, State's Attorney William Tuohy {{met in a}} closed-door {{meeting with}} Heirens's lawyers, the {{brothers}} Malachy and John Coghlan, to discuss <b>a</b> possible <b>plea</b> <b>bargain.</b>|$|R
50|$|Barry's {{reputation}} {{on the bench}} {{was that of a}} tough judge with strong command of her courtroom. In 1989, while a district court judge in Essex County, New Jersey, she disapproved <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> deal that would have freed two county detectives accused of protecting a drug dealer, and forced the case to trial. The detectives were convicted and received jail terms. She also presided over the conviction of Louis Manna, the Genovese crime family boss accused of plotting to assassinate rival John Gotti.|$|R
50|$|The {{verdict on}} the twelve officers, along with 17 others, will be {{released}} on the next scheduled hearing. The court will likely impose the penalty of “dishonorable discharge” on the junior officers. Five other junior officers, including former Lt/SG Grade Antonio Trillanes IV, who won {{a seat in the}} Senate in the 2007 Philippine mid-term elections, have not indicated any intention to enter into <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> agreement with the court. Trillanes, Gambala and Maestrecampo are members of the Philippine Military Academy Class of 1995.|$|R
5|$|Fastow and his wife, Lea, both {{pleaded guilty}} to charges against them. Fastow was {{initially}} charged with 98 counts of fraud, money laundering, insider trading, and conspiracy, among other crimes. Fastow {{pleaded guilty to}} two charges of conspiracy {{and was sentenced to}} ten years with no parole in <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargain</b> to testify against Lay, Skilling, and Causey. Lea was indicted on six felony counts, but prosecutors later dismissed them in favor of a single misdemeanor tax charge. Lea was sentenced to one year for helping her husband hide income from the government.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Gabi Ben Harosh, {{partner of}} the Abergil brothers, was arrested in Los Angeles. After two years of house arrest, he signed <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargain</b> for minor offenses, {{connected}} to bringing in foreign currency without a permit, {{and was sentenced to}} community service and judicial supervision for three years. In view of the Abergil brothers extradition to the US, {{he and his wife were}} arrested for violating immigration laws. It is believed that American authorities tried to apply pressure to Ben Harosh to incriminate the Abergil brothers but failed.|$|E
5|$|Prosecutors {{believed}} Nicole Bostic, 26 at the time, aided Lee Woods {{in hiding}} the guns {{found in the}} BMW that Timoshenko and Yan pulled over, dumping them in a nearby garage before police retrieved them; N. Bostic, however, only admitted to giving Woods a ride. She pled guilty to helping the three men escape, and originally faced seven {{years in prison for}} her role. She later accepted <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargain,</b> pleading guilty to a misdemeanor count of hindering the prosecution in exchange for three years probation, thereby avoiding jail.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} the author explores {{what it means}} for a {{prosecutor}} to “do justice” in <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> context. Although the vast majority of criminal cases in the United States are resolved by guilty plea rather than by trial, ABA Model Rule 3. 8, the special disciplinary rule applicable to prosecutors, has very little to say about <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining.</b> Scrutinizing the multiplicity of interests at stake in <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining,</b> the author suggests that a prosecutor’s primary objectives during negotiations should be efficiency, equality, autonomy, and transparency. After defining each of these terms, the author identifies several troublesome and recurring practices employed by prosecutors in the <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> context that in his view violate a prosecutor’s duty to “do justice,” but yet presently are entirely unregulated. He then demonstrates how a focus on efficiency, equality, autonomy and transparency might help prosecutors avoid these ethical minefields...|$|R

50|$|Brought {{to trial}} in 1992 at the Federal District Court in Brooklyn over various charges of fraud, McNamara faced a maximum {{sentence}} of $800M in fines and 20 years in jail. However, <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> deal with state and federal prosecutors reduced this considerably, {{on the condition that}} he provide evidence against the officials he had bribed with regards to his property development projects. In concluding the case, the judge agreed that McNamara's sentence could be reviewed further, should the value of his evidence prove great and should McNamara choose to enter the Federal Witness Protection Program.|$|R
5|$|Rajneesh left Oregon {{by plane}} on October 27, 1985, and was arrested when he landed in Charlotte, North Carolina, {{and charged with}} 35 counts of {{deliberate}} violations of immigration laws. As part of <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargain</b> arrangement, {{he pleaded guilty to}} two counts of making false statements to immigration officials. He received a ten-year suspended sentence and a fine of US$400,000, and was deported and barred from reentering the United States for a period of five years. He was never prosecuted for crimes related to the Salmonella attack.|$|E
5|$|Davis is acquitted, but Freamon {{uses the}} threat of federal {{prosecution}} to blackmail him for information. Davis reveals Maurice Levy has a mole in the courthouse from whom he illegally purchases copies of sealed indictments. Herc tells Levy that the Stanfield case was probably based on an illegal wiretap, something which would jeopardize the entire case. After Levy reveals this to Pearlman, she uses Levy's espionage to blackmail him into agreeing to <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargain</b> for his defendants. Levy ensures Stanfield's release {{on the condition that}} he permanently retires, while his subordinates will have to accept long sentences. Stanfield sells the connection to The Greeks back to the Co-Op and plans to become a businessman, although he appears unable or unwilling to stay off the corner.|$|E
5|$|Suter {{reached the}} 70 point {{mark in the}} next two seasons, {{finishing}} with 76 in 1989–90 and 70 in 1990–91. His latter campaign earned him his fourth All-Star Game appearance. Suter also played much of the season while awaiting trial after he was arrested following a June 1990 scuffle with police as they tried to arrest fellow NHL player Chris Chelios. The issue was resolved in February 1991 when he agreed to <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargain</b> on reduced charges and paid an $8,250 fine. A knee injury caused Suter to miss ten games in 1991–92, but he reached two milestones during the season. He scored his 100th career goal on February 25, 1992, against the Buffalo Sabres, and played in his 500th game on March 12 against the Philadelphia Flyers.|$|E
50|$|Handley {{was convicted}} in May 2009 {{as the result of}} {{entering}} <b>a</b> guilty <b>plea</b> <b>bargain</b> at the recommendation of Chase, under the belief that the jury chosen to judge him would not acquit him of the obscenity charges if they were shown the images of question.|$|R
50|$|His accomplishments as DA {{included}} <b>a</b> no <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> {{policy on}} the most violent crimes, his joint effort with other law enforcement {{to crack down on}} possession of guns by convicted felons, and his creation of special prosecution units to focus on gang violence, drug trafficking, domestic violence and child abuse.|$|R
25|$|In 1977, Polanski {{was arrested}} and charged with drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl. He {{subsequently}} pled guilty to the charge of statutory rape. He was released from prison after serving 42 days, and as part of <b>an</b> apparent <b>plea</b> <b>bargain,</b> was to be put on probation. When he learned that the judge had changed his mind and planned to reject the <b>plea</b> <b>bargain,</b> he fled to Paris before sentencing.|$|R
5|$|After {{a four-month}} investigation, the {{criminal}} justice branch of the Attorney General of British Columbia announced formal charges of assault causing bodily harm against Bertuzzi on June 24, 2004. With the charge, Bertuzzi faced up to one-and-a-half years in prison. Bertuzzi pleaded guilty to the assault charge on December 22 after arranging <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargain</b> with prosecutors. He was given a conditional discharge requiring 80 {{hours of community service}} and one year's probation that additionally prohibited him from playing in any hockey game Moore was competing in. Under Canadian law, Bertuzzi's successful completion of his probationary period precluded him from a criminal record. Moore expressed disappointment regarding Bertuzzi's discharge and was upset that he was unable to attend the court date, having to issue a written victim statement instead. Moore's lawyer, Tim Danson, was given one day's notice of the court date following Bertuzzi's plea bargain, which he said was insufficient time for Moore to travel to Vancouver.|$|E
5|$|On December 12, 2001, Ryder {{was arrested}} on {{shoplifting}} charges in Beverly Hills, California. She was accused of stealing $5,500 worth of designer clothes and accessories at a Saks Fifth Avenue department store. In the security offices of the store, before Ryder was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department, she signed two civil demands that bound her {{to pay for the}} stolen and surrendered merchandise, as permitted under California's Statute for Civil Recovery for Shoplifting. Los Angeles District Attorney Stephen Cooley produced a team of eight prosecutors, and filed four felony charges against her. Ryder hired noted celebrity defense attorney Mark Geragos. Negotiations for <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargain</b> failed at the end of summer 2002. As noted by Joel Mowbray from National Review, the prosecution was not ready to offer the actress an open door to a no-contest plea on misdemeanor charges.|$|E
5|$|The {{so-called}} NatWest Three — Giles Darby, David Bermingham and Gary Mulgrew — were extradited to the United States in 2006 {{on charges}} relating to a transaction with Enron Corporation in 2000 {{while they were}} working for Greenwich NatWest. It {{has been argued that}} the alleged crime was committed by British citizens living in the UK against a British company based in London and therefore, any resulting criminal case falls {{under the jurisdiction of the}} English courts. However, the Serious Fraud Office decided not to prosecute due to lack of evidence. There has been criticism that the Americans do not have to produce a prima facie case, or even a reasonable one, to extradite British citizens, whereas no such facility exists to extradite US citizens to the UK. On 28 November 2007 the three admitted one charge of wire fraud after <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargain.</b> On 22 February 2008 they were each sentenced to 37 months in prison.|$|E
40|$|The present Article {{demonstrates}} {{the error of}} this universalist theory of <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> by showing how and why one major legal system, the West German, has so successfully avoided any form or analogue of <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> in its procedures for cases of serious crime. The German criminal justice system functions without <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> not by good fortune, {{but as a result}} of deliberate policies and careful institutional design whose essential elements are outlined in Part I. Part II addresses the American claims that <b>a</b> clandestine <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> system lurks behind veils of German pretense...|$|R
50|$|In 1977, Polanski {{was arrested}} and charged with the rape of a 13-year-old girl named Samantha Geimer. He {{subsequently}} pled guilty to the charge of statutory rape.

50|$|Schettino's {{trial was}} {{separated}} from a trial against five Costa employees, namely Roberto Ferrarini (the company's crisis director, who {{was found guilty of}} minimizing the extent of the disaster and delaying an adequate response), cabin service director Manrico Giampedroni, first officer Ciro Ambrosio, helmsman Jacob Rusli Bin, and third officer Silvia Coronica. All pled guilty in <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> scheme and received jail sentences ranging from 18 months to two years and 10 months. Reuters cited judicial sources as saying none of these individuals were likely to go to jail as sentences less than two years for non-violent offences are routinely suspended in Italy, and longer sentences may be appealed or replaced by community service.|$|R
5|$|Giles Darby, David Bermingham, and Gary Mulgrew {{worked for}} Greenwich NatWest. The three British men {{had worked with}} Fastow on a special purpose entity he had started called Swap Sub. When Fastow was being {{investigated}} by the SEC, the three men met with the British Financial Services Authority (FSA) in November 2001 to discuss their interactions with Fastow. In June 2002, the U.S. issued warrants for their arrest on seven counts of wire fraud, and they were then extradited. On July 12, a potential Enron witness scheduled to be extradited to the U.S., Neil Coulbeck, {{was found dead in}} a park in north-east London. Coulbeck's death was eventually ruled to have been a suicide. The U.S. case alleged that Coulbeck and others conspired with Fastow. In <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargain</b> in November 2007, the trio plead guilty to one count of wire fraud while the other six counts were dismissed. Darby, Bermingham, and Mulgrew were each sentenced to 37 months in prison. In August 2010, Bermingham and Mulgrew retracted their confessions.|$|E
5|$|However, Nosanchuk {{was still}} not certain that he would attempt to defend Lamb on mental grounds. In Ontario at that time, a {{defendant}} found not guilty under these terms remained imprisoned indefinitely unless an order for his release came from the province's Executive Council, acting {{on the advice of}} a Review Board including a Supreme Court Judge. Yaworsky warned Nosanchuk that even if he used an insanity defence and won, Lamb would probably be committed to an institution for the criminally insane for life. It was still possible for the lawyer to approach the prosecution and propose <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargain,</b> offering to plead guilty to non-capital murder, which would result in life imprisonment for Lamb but allow a parole hearing after 10 years. In any case, Nosanchuk could not use the case he had prepared unless he first received unequivocal written instruction from his client to plead insanity. Having been given a week by his counsel to consider the matter, Lamb wrote to Nosanchuk that he wished to attempt a mental disorder defence. The boy made clear his understanding that if he were found not guilty under these terms, the state still had the right to detain him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Under {{increasingly}} immense {{pressure to}} resign, Agnew took {{the position that}} a sitting vice president could not be indicted and met with Speaker of the House Carl Albert on September 25, asking for an investigation. He cited as precedent an 1826 House investigation of Vice President John C. Calhoun, who was alleged to have taken improper payments while a cabinet member. Albert, second in line to the presidency under Agnew, responded {{that it would be}} improper for the House to act in a matter before the courts. Agnew also filed a motion to block any indictment on the grounds that he had been prejudiced by improper leaks from the Justice Department, and tried to rally public opinion, giving a speech before a friendly audience in Los Angeles asserting his innocence and attacking the prosecution. Nevertheless, Agnew entered into negotiations for <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargain,</b> and wrote in his memoirs that he did so because he was worn out from the extended crisis, to protect his family, and because he feared he could not get a fair trial. He made his decision on October 5, and plea negotiations took place over the following days. On October 9, Agnew visited Nixon at the White House and informed the President of his impending resignation.|$|E

When the Mexican government {{became aware of}} the activities, a mass grave containing at least twelve bodies was found in a house on 3633 Calle Parsioneros, Ciudad Juárez, which came to be dubbed the [...] "House of Death." [...] Santillán was convicted of trafficking by Johnny Sutton, but in <b>a</b> <b>plea</b> <b>bargaining</b> agreement, he was not accused of murder, and [...] "Lalo", the former informant for the US government, now sits in a high-security prison awaiting extradition to Mexico, which will be according to him tantamount to a death sentence.
