40|$|We report {{results from}} ab initio cluster-model {{calculations}} on the O(1 s) binding energy (BE) in the <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>oxides,</b> MgO, CaO, SrO, and BaO; all these oxides have a cubic lattice structure. We have obtained values {{for both the}} initial- and final-state BE's. A simple point-charge model, where an O 2 -anion is surrounded by point charges, accounts for the observed shift in the O(1 s) BE by about 2. 5 eV to lower energy going from MgO (largest BE) to BaO (smallest BE). This point-charge model only describes {{the effect of the}} Madelung potential at the 1 s ionized O 2 - anion; it does not allow any covalent bonding between the metal (M) cations and the oxygen anions. Once the effect of the O 2 [...] > M 2 + covalent bonding is included explicitly by using O(m) M(n) cluster models of the MO crystal, the trend in the O(1 s) BE to smaller values for heavier metals does not change significantly. This shows that the main contribution to the shift is not the different amount of covalent mixing in the <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>oxides</b> but rather the change in the Madelung potential along the group...|$|E

We investigate the trend of increasing Z ∗ values through the series, using band–by–band decompositions and computational experiments performed on fake materials with artificially–modified covalence. The deviations of Z ∗ from the nominal value 2 are due to the increasing interaction between O 2 p orbitals and unoccupied cation d states.

Two cancelling initial states mechanisms in the oxides are responsible for the trend. One is the increase of the BEs for the dication over the neutral atom. The second is the decrease of the free dication BEs due to the Madelung potential of the ionic oxides. The trend given by the sum of these two contributions to the chemical shifts is in full agreement with experiment.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>oxide</b> {{additions}} on aqueous rechargeable battery is investigated using microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. The <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>oxide</b> additions such as magnesium oxide (MgO) and barium oxide (BaO) were physically mixed to the manganese dioxide (MnO 2) cathode {{of a cell}} comprising zinc as an anode and aqueous lithium hydroxide as the electrolyte. The results showed that such additions greatly improved the discharge capacity of the battery (from 145 to 195 for MgO and 265 mAh/g for BaO). Capacity fade with subsequent cycling is reduced only for MgO but not for BaO. With an aim to understand the role of these additives and its improvement in cell performance, we have used microscopy, spectroscopy, ion beam analysis and diffraction based techniques to study the process. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis (EDS) results showed evidence of crystalline MnO 2 particles for MgO as additive, whereas, MnO 2 particles with diffused structure leading to mixture of phases is observed for BaO additives which is in agreement with X-ray diffraction (XRD) data.

40|$|Infrared {{spectra of}} acetone adsorbed at beam {{temperature}} on α-Fe 2 O 3 show that acetone can chemisorb on Lewis-acid sites and gives, at least partially, enolate anions; these, by aldolic condensation with {{molecules from the}} gas phase, produce a chemisorbed form of mesityl oxide. At 523 K acetate ions are formed. Two different forms of trichloroacetate ions are formed on the surface at beam temperature by the adsorption of hexachloroacetone and trichloroacetic acid. This behaviour indicates the presence of pairs of acid-base sites {{on the surface of}} haematite, and also shows that its surface hydroxy groups have a lower degree of nucleophilic character with respect to those of other oxides such as aluminas, SnO 2 and <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>oxides...</b>|$|E

The gap is calculated in several ways: as a difference between one-electron energy eigenvalues and as a difference between the total energies of appropriate electronic states of the crystal, both at the HF level and with inclusion of Coulomb correlation effects. The results compare well with experimental band gap energies and with other theoretical calculations, suggesting that the picture of bonding and excitation given by the model can be useful in ionic materials.

40|$|The {{heterogeneous}} {{reduction of}} NO by H- 2 and CO over different CaO materials is investigated. The {{dependence of the}} specific NO reduction rate on the impurity content is demonstrated for both reducing species.

The apparent activation energies for the NO + CO and NO + Hz reactions are determined for three different calcium oxides. Values between 26 and 28 kcal/mol are obtained. The influence of impurity content is found in the preexponential factor of the Arrhenius equation. A reaction mechanism based on a rate-determining surface-oxygen-abstraction step is suggested.

40|$|The optical {{absorption}} of V [...] type centers (F+ antimorphs and related defects) in the <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>oxides</b> is explained as a light induced transfer of holes between equivalent O 2 - sites next to cation vacancy type defects, the excitation acting against the self-induced trapping potentials. The interplay between symmetry-breaking hole-phonon- and symmetry-restoring resonance-interaction is formulated as a Pseudo-Jahn-Teller effect.

Four kinds of alkaline-earth metal (Mg, Ca, Sr, or Ba) oxides of 3. 0 % by weight were loaded between the Ni 6 Zr 4 O 14 main catalytic species and the microporous Zeolite Y support. The characterizations of these catalysts were examined by XRD, TEM, H 2 -TPR, NH 3 -TPD, and XPS. Catalytic performances during ESR were found to depend on the basicity of the added <b>alkaline-earth</b> metal <b>oxides</b> and H 2 production and ethanol conversion were maximized to 82 % and 98 % respectively in 27 (Ni 6 Zr 4 O 14) 3 MgO/ 70 Zeolite Y catalyst at 600 oC.

The model used to represent the local environment of a metal cation in the bulk oxide is an MO 6 cluster which also includes the effect of the lattice Madelung potential. The analysis of the wave functions for these clusters leads to the conclusion that all the <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>oxides</b> must be regarded as highly ionic oxides; however, the ionic character of the oxides decreases as one goes from MgO, almost perfectly ionic, to BaO. In Al 2 O 3 the ionic character is further reduced; however, even in this case, the departure from the ideal, fully ionic, model of Al 3 + is not exceptionally large. These conclusions are based on three measures, a decomposition of the M(q+) - O(q-) interaction energy, the number of electrons associated to the oxygen ions as obtained from a projection operator technique, and the analysis of the cation core-level binding energies.

The accuracy of commonly used exchange-correlation density functionals (LDA, PBE, RPBE, PBEsol, BEEF-vdW and hybrid HSE) and random-phase approximation (RPA) is evaluated and compared to existing experimental values. Calculated surface energies of the four most stable surface facets under vacuum conditions: the (100) surface, the metal and oxygen terminated octopolar (111), and the (110) surfaces exhibit a monotonic increase in stability from MgO to BaO. On the MgO(100) surface, adsorption of CO, NO, CH 4 is characterized by physisorption while H 2 O chemisorbs, which is in agreement with experimental findings. We further use the on-top metal adsorption of CO and NO molecules to map out the surface energetics of each <b>alkaline-earth</b> metal <b>oxide</b> surface. The considered functionals all qualitatively predict similar adsorption energy trends. The ordering between the adsorption energies on different surface facets {{can be attributed to}} differences in the local geometrical surface structure and the electronic structure of the metal constituent of the <b>alkaline-earth</b> metal <b>oxide.</b> The striking observation that CO adsorption strength is weaker than NO adsorption on the (100) terraces as the period of the alkaline-earth metal in the oxide increases, is analyzed in detail in terms of charge redistribution within the σ and π channels of adsorbates.

The spectroscopic results further confirm the formation of dissimilar pairs atomistically, where it increases with increasing <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>oxide</b> content These results, are the manifestation of local structural changes in the silicate network with composition which give rise to different environments into which the alkali ions hop. The Na+ ion mobility varies inversely with dissimilar pair formation, i. e. it decreases with increase of non-random formation of dissimilar pairs. Remarkably, we found that increased degree of non-randomness leads to temperature dependent variation in number density of sodium ions. Furthermore, the present study provides the strong link between the dynamics of the alkali ions and different sites associated with it in soda-lime silicate glasses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

Kaolinite/halloysite play an opposite role versus smectite/interstratified I/S in slip casting and tile pressing: the former allow faster casting rates, while the latter improve powder flowability and mechanical strength.

The influence of these additives on the electrochemical {{behavior of the}} MnO 2 cathode in a Zn-MnO 2 battery using lithium hydroxide (LiOH) as an electrolyte is investigated.

With the aim of obtaining information about the intrinsic {{reactivity of}} these elements, samples have been prepared in which the active elements have been directly deposited on the soot (‘‘full contact’’ conditions). In this way the reactivity of the catalytic elements is not controlled {{by the type of}} contact with the soot. It is found that the combustion of soot is greatly enhanced by the presence of either alkaline or <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>oxides,</b> with Cs and Mg exhibiting the highest and the lowest activity, respectively. Notably, the reactivity in the soot combustion is found to nicely correlate with the electropositivity of the investigated metal ions, in line with literature indications pointing out the relevance of the electron-donor characteristics of the active elements. The correlation between electropositivity and activity in the soot combustion is not apparent {{in the absence of a}} close contact, i. e. under loose contact conditions. Under these conditions it is suggested that the catalytic activity is governed by the mobility of the surface species, which favors the soot–catalyst contact.

Nevertheless, the structures of the doubly charged clusters are rather similar for the two materials.

40|$|Complex oxide systems {{containing}} silica and alumina (so-called slag) {{are important}} in many fields of science and industry. One of the main problems in coal combustion processes is the alkali release. This alkali release leads to an alkali concentration in the flue gas {{significantly higher than the}} specifications of the gas turbine manufacture`s. Molten coal ash slag containing high concentration of SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3 and alkali and other <b>alkaline-earth</b> <b>oxides</b> has a high potential for alkali retention depending on the alkali oxide activity in the slag. Compared to experimental methods thermodynamic equilibrium modelling is able to generate results within less time at lower costs. In order to perform calculations concerning systems which have a complicated structure and strong interactions between the constituents an adequate thermodynamic model and assessed thermodynamic data are needed. The accuracy of the calculation depends on the reliability of the database and adaptability of the model. The goal of the present work is {{the development of a new}} database optimised for the basic quaternary oxide system containing the main slag components SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 and the alkali oxides Na 2 O and K 2 O. This system can be considered as a basis for the future addition of further slag-relevant oxides such as Fe 2 O 3 and the alkaline earth oxides CaO and MgO. This complex oxide system was investigated with respect to the thermodynamic description of the liquid solution (slag). The available thermodynamic data were collected, analysed and modified for the purpose of improving the solution database. The associate solution model was adapted to the accepted database FACT. The associate species approach was applied to represent the phase relations in the binary systems Me 2 O-SiO 2, Me 2 O-Al 2 O 3 (Me = Na, K) and SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 and in the ternary systems K 2 O Na 2 O-SiO 2 and Na 2 O-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2. The phase equilibria calculated using the associate model with the new optimised slag solution data show good agreement with the experimental points. In the literature, the binary systems Me 2 O-SiO 2 and Me 2 O-Al 2 O 3 (Me = Na, K) were not investigated regarding their phase diagrams in the composition range near the pure alkali oxide. In contrast to the old database, the new dataset allows the description of the whole composition range of the binary systems. The investigations performed show that the associate species approach cannot only be used for the representation of liquid solutions but also for the representation of solid solutions (nepheline and carnegieite) without taking into account the structure of the solid solution. The comparison of measured partial pressures of potassium over the liquid phase and of potassium oxide activities in the quaternary Na 2 O-K 2 O-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 melt with calculated values show relatively good agreement although these data have not yet been taken into account for the optimisation. The associate species model can therefore be applied to describe and predict the thermodynamic properties of the considered system (phase diagram and activity data) and extended to multicomponent systems taking into account “multicomponent” interactions as well...|$|E

40|$|Catalytic {{reforming}} {{of methane}} with carbon dioxide was studied in a fixed-bed reactor using unpromoted and promoted Ni/-Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The effects of promoters, such as alkali metal oxide (Na 2 O), <b>alkaline-earth</b> metal <b>oxides</b> (MgO, CaO) and rare-earth metal oxides (La 2 O 3, CeO 2), on the catalytic activity {{and stability in}} terms of coking resistance and coke reactivity were systematically examined. CaO-, La 2 O 3 - and CeO 2 -promoted Ni/-Al 2 O 3 catalysts exhibited higher stability whereas MgO- and Na 2 O-promoted catalysts demonstrated lower activity and significant deactivation. Metal-oxide promoters (Na 2 O, MgO, La 2 O 3, and CeO 2) suppressed the carbon deposition, primarily due to the enhanced basicities of the supports and highly reactive carbon species formed during the reaction. In contrast, CaO increased the carbon deposition; however, it promoted the carbon reactivity...|$|R
40|$|We {{formulate}} a spin-polarized van Leeuwen and Baerends (vLB) correction {{to the local}} density approximation (LDA) exchange potential [Phys. Rev. A 49, 2421 (1994) ] that enforces the ionization potential (IP) theorem following Stein et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 266802 (2010) ]. For electronic-structure problems, the vLB-correction replicates the behavior of exact-exchange potentials, with improved scaling and well-behaved asymptotics, but with the computational cost of semi-local functionals. The vLB+IP corrections produces large improvement in the eigenvalues over that from LDA due to correct asympotic behavior and atomic shell structures, as shown on rare-gas, <b>alkaline-earth,</b> zinc-based <b>oxides,</b> alkali-halides, sulphides, and nitrides. In half-Heusler alloys, this asymptotically-corrected LDA reproduces the spin-polarized properties correctly, including magnetism and half-metallicity. We also considered finite-sized systems [e. g., ringed boron-nitirde (B$_{ 12 }$N$_{ 12 }$) and graphene (C$_{ 24 }$) ] to emphasize the wide applicability of the method.

40|$|Oxides {{with good}} p-type {{conductivity}} have been long sought after to achieve high performance all-oxide optoelectronic devices. Divalent Sn(II) based oxides are promising candidates {{because of their}} rather dispersive upper valence bands caused by the Sn- 5 s/O- 2 p anti-bonding hybridization. There are so far few known Sn(II) oxides being p-type conductive suitable for device applications. Here, we present via first-principles global optimization structure searches a material design study for a hitherto unexplored Sn(II) -based system, ternary <b>alkaline-earth</b> metal Sn(II) <b>oxides</b> in the stoichiometry of MSn 2 O 3 (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba). We identify two stable compounds of SrSn 2 O 3 and BaSn 2 O 3, which can be stabilized by Sn-rich conditions in phase stability diagrams. Their structures follow the Zintl behaviour and consist of basic structural motifs of SnO 3 tetrahedra. Unexpectedly they show distinct electronic properties with band gaps ranging from 1. 90 (BaSn 2 O 3) to 3. 15 (SrSn 2 O 3) eV, and hole effective masses ranging from 0. 87 (BaSn 2 O 3) to above 6. 0 (SrSn 2 O 3) m 0. Further exploration of metastable phases indicates a wide tunability of electronic properties controlled by {{the details of the}} bonding between the basic structural motifs. This suggests further exploration of <b>alkaline-earth</b> metal Sn(II) <b>oxides</b> for potential applications requiring good p-type conductivity such as transparent conductors and photovoltaic absorbers.

40|$|<b>Alkaline-earth</b> metal <b>oxide</b> aerogels {{prepared}} by sol–gel method followed by autoclave drying are nanocrystalline mesoporous materials with high reactivity. Bulk solid-state reaction of MgO aerogels with CF 2 Cl 2 takes place {{after a long}} induction period, during which the active sites are accumulated {{on the surface of}} the nanoparticles. It was found that vanadium addition has a promoting effect on this reaction accelerating the process of the active sites formation. A method for characterization of electron-acceptor sites by electron spin resonance spectroscopy using perylene as the spin probe was developed. A good correlation was observed between the rate of the CF 2 Cl 2 destructive sorption and the concentration of weak electron-acceptor sites. Simplified models of such sites were suggested. The acid sites on the modified MgO surface were supposed to be originated from separation of the charged fragments resulting in the surface polarization. Uncompensated oxygen substitution for chlorine and/or fluorine ions leads to appearance of Lewis acid sites while HCl/HF chemisorption results in Bronsted acid sites formation...|$|R
