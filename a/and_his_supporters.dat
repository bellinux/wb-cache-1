5|$|As {{the first}} groups of his partisans fleeing the capital arrived at Demotika, Kantakouzenos, {{by his own}} account, tried to {{negotiate}} with the new regency, but his approach was rebuffed. Finally forced to take decisive action, on 26 October 1341, the army (2,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry, according to Gregoras) <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>supporters,</b> largely drawn from the land-holding aristocracy, proclaimed Kantakouzenos Emperor. Although he still presented himself officially as a junior colleague to John V, and claimed to be only acting in the boy's name, having staked his claim on the throne, he had effectively started a civil war. Kantakouzenos still hoped that negotiation might resolve the situation, but all his envoys were imprisoned and he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>supporters</b> excommunicated by Patriarch John XIV. On 19 November 1341, the regency responded to Kantakouzenos' proclamation as Emperor with the formal coronation of John V.|$|E
5|$|His exile over, in 1900 {{he moved}} to Western Europe, where he joined the {{editorial}} board of Iskra, the publication of the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). Iskras base was moved from Munich to London and then to Geneva, each time accompanied by Lenin. At the party's second congress, held in London in 1902, a major schism erupted between Lenin <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>supporters</b> (the Bolsheviks) and Julius Martov <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>supporters</b> (the Mensheviks); Lenin emphasised a strongly centralised party controlled largely by the leadership, whereas Martov accepted a wider party with more independence of thought. Lenin returned to Russia briefly during the Revolution of 1905, but fled again when the Tsarist authorities defeated the revolutionary forces and cracked down on dissent.|$|E

5|$|The LaRouche {{criminal}} {{trials in}} the mid-1980s stemmed from federal and state investigations into the activities of American political activist Lyndon LaRouche and members of his movement. They were charged with conspiring to commit fraud and soliciting loans they {{had no intention of}} repaying. LaRouche <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>supporters</b> disputed the charges, claiming the trials were politically motivated.|$|E
5|$|Al-Mukhtar <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>supporters</b> viewed Ubayd Allah's {{death as}} justice {{for his role}} in the killing of Husayn at Karbala in 680. As a result of the battle, al-Mukhtar gained control over Mosul and the {{surrounding}} region, and he appointed Ibn al-Ashtar governor of Mosul.

5|$|Apart {{from around}} 50 songs, Meyerbeer wrote little {{except for the}} stage. The {{critical}} assaults of Wagner <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>supporters,</b> especially after his death, led {{to a decline in}} the popularity of his works; his operas were suppressed by the Nazi regime in Germany, and were neglected by opera houses through most of the twentieth century. In the 21st century, however, the composer's major French grand operas have begun to reappear in the repertory of numerous European opera houses.|$|E
5|$|Burton was {{the first}} {{defendant}} convicted under § 1782 of the Revised Statutes, 40 years after its 1864 enactment. Burton <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>supporters</b> argued that he was selectively prosecuted, on the orders of President Theodore Roosevelt, for political reasons. Burton also became {{the first member of}} the United States Senate to be convicted of public corruption, in fact the first member of the Senate to be convicted of any crime. The next year, Senator John H. Mitchell (R-OR) was convicted under the same statute {{for his role in the}} Oregon land fraud scandal.|$|E
5|$|By March 1808, Jennings {{believed}} that his {{future in the}} Harrison-dominated {{western part of the}} territory was bleak. By November he had left Vincennes and moved to Jeffersonville, in Clark County, Indiana Territory, before settling in nearby Charlestown. Jennings may have believed his political future would have more success {{in the eastern part of}} the territory. Settlements in the southeast and eastern portion of the territory opposed slavery and Harrison's aristocratic manner, which were similar to Jennings's beliefs, while the western portion of the territory and Vincennes area remained proslavery. Although petitions to allow slavery were received before the formation of the Indiana Territory, the issue attracted widespread attention in 1807 when Harrison <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>supporters</b> in the territorial legislature revived efforts to allow slavery in the territory. Jennings <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>supporters</b> who opposed slavery wrote writing articles appearing in the Vincennes Western Sun newspaper attacking Harrison's administration, its pro-slavery sentiments, and aristocratic policies.|$|E

5|$|Géza died in 1077, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>supporters</b> made Ladislaus king. Solomon {{resisted}} Ladislaus {{with the}} assistance of King Henry IV of Germany.

In 1081, Solomon abdicated and acknowledged Ladislaus's reign, but he conspired to regain the royal crown and Ladislaus imprisoned him. Ladislaus canonized the first Hungarian saints (including his distant relatives, King Stephen I and Duke Emeric) in 1085. He set Solomon free during the canonization ceremony.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Trotsky <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>supporters</b> {{believed}} that Stalin's {{influence over the}} Third International could still be fought from within and slowly rolled back. They organised themselves into the International Left Opposition in 1930, which {{was intended to be}} a group of anti-Stalinist dissenters within the Third International. Stalin's supporters, who dominated the International, would no longer tolerate dissent. All Trotskyists, and those suspected of being influenced by Trotskyism, were expelled.|$|E

5|$|Kogălniceanu {{also signed}} {{his name to}} the {{proclamation}} Alegătorul Liber ("The Enfranchised Voter"), which stated the main National Liberal goals.

In an 1876 speech in front of Parliament, Kogălniceanu attacked Ionescu <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>supporters</b> for their political and academic positions, approval from the conservative literary society Junimea and its anti-liberal gazette Timpul.|$|E
5|$|Ladislaus {{contracted}} {{an unidentified}} serious illness, but recovered from it. He attributed this recovery to a miracle by his deceased saintly aunt, Margaret, {{and approached the}} Holy See to promote her canonization in 1275. In the same year, a new civil war broke out between Joachim Gutkeled and Peter Csák. Ladislaus took part in Csák's military expedition against the Kőszegis, who were Gutkeled's supporters. However, Gutkeled <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>supporters</b> removed their opponents from power at an assembly of the barons and noblemen at Buda around 21 June 1276.|$|E
5|$|Lê Duẩn's {{report to}} the 5th National Congress was a biting self-criticism of his {{leadership}} and the party's management. He criticised political and economic corruption and the gerontocracy itself. The 5th Central Committee contained only one member under 60. During this period the Central Committee was disrupted by factional infighting between pragmatists and conservatives. This struggle would lead to economic reform. Lê Duẩn <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>supporters</b> began the effort to open the economy.|$|E

5|$|The cost of {{clamping}} down on {{the protests}} was a loss of legitimacy, {{and the emergence of}} Amin al-Hafiz as the first Ba'athist military strongman. The traditional elite, consisting of the upper classes, who had been overthrown from political power by the Ba'athists, felt threatened by the Ba'ath Party's socialist policies. The Muslim Brotherhood in Syria was a historical rival of the Syrian Regional Branch, and it felt threatened by the party's secular nature. Akram al-Hawrani <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>supporters</b> and the Syrian Communist Party opposed the one-party system which the Ba'ath Party was establishing.|$|E
