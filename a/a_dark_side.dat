5|$|Unlike Love's Last Shift, {{which never}} again {{performed}} after the 1690s, The Relapse has retained its audience appeal. In the 18th century, however, its tolerant attitude towards actual and attempted adultery gradually became unacceptable to public opinion, {{and the original}} play was for a century replaced on the stage by Sheridan's moralised version A Trip to Scarborough (1777). On the modern stage, The Relapse has been established {{as one of the}} most popular Restoration comedies, valued for Vanbrugh's light, throwaway wit and the consummate acting part of Lord Foppington, a burlesque character with <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E

500|$|When {{creating}} Naruto for {{the initial}} part of the series, Kishimoto kept the character [...] "simple and stupid", while giving him many attributes of an ideal hero. Kishimoto gave Naruto <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> by adding tragedy to the character's past. He has revised Naruto's image many times, providing the character with different clothes intended to appeal to Western audiences and to make him easier to illustrate. Kishimoto changed his design for Part II of the storyline, which starts two-and-a-half years after Part I. Naruto is voiced by Junko Takeuchi in the original animated series and Maile Flanagan in the English adaptations.|$|E
500|$|On 15 July 2009, the series's sixth instalment, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was released.

Also, Half-Blood Prince {{remains one of the}} most positively reviewed entries within the series among film critics, who praised the film's [...] "emotionally satisfying" [...] story, direction, cinematography, visuals and music. Grint observed a change in Ron in this entry, pointing out that his once insecure, often overshadowed character started to become more secure and even began to show <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> of himself. The actor found it fun to personify a more emotional Ron. Between 2009 and 2010, his work received three nominations, including one win an Otto Award from the German magazine Bravo.|$|E

500|$|It was at Arrowhead that Melville {{finished}} his novel Moby-Dick; though {{the work was}} not recognized during the author's lifetime, it has since become {{known as one of}} the greatest American literary masterpieces. Hawthorne's influence on Melville while writing the book is significant. Melville wrote a review of Mosses from an Old Manse, published by Duyckinck, and in it he believed that these stories revealed <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> to Hawthorne, [...] "shrouded in blackness, ten times black". Moby-Dick was dedicated to Hawthorne: [...] "In token of my admiration for his genius, this book is inscribed to Nathaniel Hawthorne." [...] Hawthorne, in turn, referenced Melville in his book A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys: [...] "On the higher side of Pittsfield, sits Herman Melville, shaping out the gigantic conception of his 'White Wale' while the gigantic shape of Graylock looms upon him from his study-window." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 90s, new manga author Masashi Kishimoto {{sought to}} write a {{one-shot}} chapter that would feature Naruto as a chef, but this version {{never made it to}} print. Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of Naruto for the summer 1997 issue of Akamaru Jump magazine based on the idea. For the serialized version, Kishimoto incorporated traits he felt made an ideal hero in the creation of Naruto: a straightforward way of thinking, a mischievous side, and attributes possessed by Goku from the Dragon Ball franchise. Aiming to keep Naruto [...] "simple and stupid", Kishimoto avoided modeling him after anyone in particular, instead conceiving of him as naïve with <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> resulting from his harsh past. Despite this, he is always optimistic, a trait Kishimoto said makes this character unique. By and large, Naruto's personality is childish; the creator tried to convey this trait in his illustrations. Kishimoto notes as an example of this the cover of volume 10, where Kishimoto depicts Naruto mimicking a turtle as a child might do. Naruto was Kishimoto's first published manga, and he focused on making Naruto's facial expressions consistent in difficult situations. He commented: [...] "It's rather awkward to talk about what makes Naruto appealing to audiences, but I think his being a knucklehead gives him an appeal." [...] He believed it was Naruto's losses that made readers identify with him, although he wanted Naruto not to feel defeat again, which was his primary aim when writing the series. Kishimoto has said that Naruto's burning desire to be a ninja was based on his own ambition to succeed as a manga artist.|$|E
500|$|Producers of Mad Men {{approached}} January Jones {{to portray}} Betty Draper, Don's {{wife and the}} mother of their two children. Jones avouched that portraying the character would give the audience an opportunity to see <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> of her nature. She initially auditioned for the role of Peggy Olson, which was later given to fellow cast member Elisabeth Moss. [...] "It got down between Elisabeth Moss and myself, and it was obviously more suited to her, but Matthew had said, you know, there’s this other role, of the wife." [...] Jones signed a seven-year contract with the show, although her character originally had two lines in [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes." [...] Weiner eventually edited the script to accommodate her desires. [...] "It’s such a testament to his ability," [...] Jones stated. [...] "He just took something out of thin air, which makes me think now that he had to have had an idea that the wife was {{going to be part of}} the show, because I kind of took the job with the promise that Betty would be a part of the show. When you sign a seven-year contract, you want to make sure you’re in the show." [...] Christina Hendricks was brought in to play Joan Holloway, the office manager and head of Sterling Cooper's secretarial pool. While Hendricks had previously made recurring appearances on ER before being on Mad Men, her acting career had been largely inactive, and Hendricks' agent urged her not to participate in the project. [...] "They said to me, 'AMC [...] doesn't have any other big shows—why would you do this instead of taking something that's a better bet?' I said, 'Look, I've gone with the one that's the better bet in the past—let's go with the really good script this time.'" ...|$|E

500|$|According to the Hindustan Times, Kaminey [...] "is {{the first}} attempt to deal with reality in a mature, matter of fact manner." [...] Unlike other Hindi films, in which the female lead is Sita, the protagonist is Rama and the {{antagonist}} is Ravana, the characters in Kaminey are nuanced humans in [...] "layered and complex" [...] situations. Namrata Joshi from Outlook wrote that Kaminey reflects Bhardwaj's [...] "enduring fascination for underdogs, characters {{on the margins of}} society and the morally compromised". Bhardwaj told Rediff.com that the film deals with [...] "themes that affect our lives directly", and [...] "is a reminder that we all have <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side,</b> and often we are not fully aware of that side". Rakesh Bedi from The Economic Times wrote, [...] "Bhardwaj presents the two warring brothers with speech defects. In today's world of logorrhea, communication is fraught with many dangers: misunderstandings, paranoias, recriminations, conflicts. Everyone speaks but no one understands. Bhardwaj gave the twins verbal impediments to show that the world has now been so hardwired to convoluted and calamitous communication that it needs silence or a speech defect to hash things out." [...] He continued, [...] "ith some glitches, Bhardwaj has almost re-birthed the Hindi film". The film also explores sex and sexuality, which according to Bedi were explored in a [...] "radically different and refreshing" [...] way, and the director [...] "daringly takes it a step further". When Sweety becomes pregnant, the couple [...] "decide to carry the pregnancy to term after a bit of hesitation. So she literally pushes her man into marriage. (Had Bhardwaj abjured marriage, {{it would have been a}} complete break but the nuptials were essential to the drama of the film.)" [...] The Daily Beast said that [...] "for aficionados of the Hindi-language genre, Kaminey is a revolutionary manifesto. It takes classic Bollywood tropes—estranged brothers, a case of mistaken identity, high drama approaching slapstick comedy—and presents them with Hollywood-style realism instead of Bollywood's wink-nudge mix of melodrama and posturing.|$|E
500|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the first three}} episodes, The New York Times saw in [...] "prim, righteous Brother Justin [...] more of a caricature, but Clancy Brown finds ways to bring some subtle glints of personality to the role." [...] Time commented, [...] "Brother Justin {{comes across as a}} typical whited sepulcher [...] if there's one thing more trite than a dwarf in a surreal drama, it's a preacher with <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> [...] and Brown's campy performance largely involves shouting 'Enough!' and 'No-o-o-o!' with horror-flick pathos." [...] Entertainment Weekly considered Brown's Brother Justin [...] "delightfully unsettling as the creepy evangelist taking his orders from the wrong superpower", and Variety thought Brown was doing [...] "a superb job straddling the line between stoic and menacing, and there are hints about his weaknesses, conveyed quickly with subtlety." [...] A season 1 DVD review by DVD Talk saw Clancy Brown's performance as [...] "nothing short of brilliant. [...] Brown also has a difficult task capturing the duality of Brother Justin, a man who presents a physically intimidating presence but who wants little more than to be a subdued and loyal servant of his Lord, and he succeeds on every level." [...] DVDverdict stated in a season 2 review that [...] "Brown's presence and charisma is dazzling; he is both likable and frightening. He is an actor {{with a great deal of}} range, and he uses all of it in this series." [...] Referring to Brown's portrayal as [...] "a man of God in Carnivale", the Los Angeles Times saw Brown's [...] "eyes always betray him as someone who, all things considered, would probably be happier caving in your skull and smoking a cigarette afterward than talking to you for another minute." [...] Time Magazine's James Poniewozik depicted the Boardwalk Empire character Nelson Van Alden (played by Michael Shannon) as [...] "such a histrionic, guilt-wracked, damnation-obsessed monster that he reminds me of Brother Justin".|$|E

2500|$|Maynard's complex {{views on}} slavery {{reflected}} shifting sentiments that were common among East Tennessee Unionists. [...] During the 1830s, Maynard, {{the son of}} an abolitionist, found slavery contemptible, calling it [...] "a curse to the country." [...] By 1850, however, Maynard was defending the practice of slavery in letters to his father, arguing there was a [...] "bright as well as <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> to slavery." [...] In 1860, Maynard owned four slaves, and while he opposed secession as a congressman, he nevertheless defended slavery. [...] Toward the end of the Civil War, Maynard again adopted an abolitionist viewpoint, and supported Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.|$|E

As a child, though, he interpreted Obi-Wan Kenobi's explanation of the Force in Star Wars to mean that any character could use its power, and that the Force was more grounded in spirituality than science.
