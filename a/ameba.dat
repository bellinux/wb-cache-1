To identify a competent human effector cell, we studied the in vitro interactions of normal human polymorphonuclear neutrophils, {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC), monocytes (MC), and MC-derived macrophages with virulent axenic <b>amebae</b> (strain HMI-IMSS). <b>Amebae</b> killed neutrophils, PBMC, MC, and MC-derived macrophages (P less than 0. 001), without loss of parasite viability. The addition of heat-inactivated immune serum did not enable leukocytes to kill <b>amebae,</b> nor did it protect these host cells from <b>amebae.</b> MC-derived macrophages, activated with lymphokine elicited by the mitogens conconavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, or an amebic soluble protein preparation (strain HK 9), killed 55 % of <b>amebae</b> by 3 h in a trypan blue exclusion assay (P less than 0. 001); during this time, 40 % of the activated macrophages died. Lysis of <b>amebae</b> was confirmed using 111 Indium oxine radiolabeled parasites and was antibody independent. Macrophage death appeared to be due to the deleterious effect of lysed <b>amebae</b> rather than the contact-dependent effector mechanisms of E. histolytica. Adherence between activated macrophages and <b>amebae</b> was greater than that between other leukocytes and <b>amebae</b> (P less than 0. 001). Microscopic observations, kinetic analysis of the killing of <b>amebae</b> by activated macrophages, and suspension of <b>amebae</b> with adherent activated macrophages in a 10 % dextran solution indicated that contact by activated macrophages was necessary to initiate the killing of <b>amebae.</b> Catalase but not superoxide dismutase inhibited the amebicidal capacity of activated macrophages (P less than 0. 001). However, activated macrophages from an individual with chronic granulomatous disease were able to kill <b>amebae,</b> but not as effectively as normal cells (P less than 0. 01).

Studies were performed with fixed or unfixed rat colonic mucosa, unfixed rat mucosa exposed to trypsin, unfixed rat submucosa, and fixed human colonic mucosa. Twenty {{percent of the}} <b>amebae</b> adhered to fixed rat colonic mucosa; adherence was specifically inhibited by N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc), galactose, and asialofetuin. The adherence of <b>amebae</b> to fixed human colonic mucosa was also GalNAc inhibitable. Greater adherence was found with unfixed rat colonic mucosa (40. 9 %) and was not GalNAc inhibitable unless the tissue was first exposed to trypsin. However, GalNAc did inhibit the adherence of <b>amebae</b> to unfixed rat submucosa. Glutaraldehyde fixation of <b>amebae</b> inactivates known amebic adhesion proteins; there was a markedly decreased adherence of fixed <b>amebae</b> to trypsin-exposed mucosa or fixed rat colonic mucosa.

We have analyzed the early morphological and electrophysiological changes occurring during the in vitro interaction of cultured <b>amebae</b> with intact or physically damaged corneas obtained from hamsters. Both species of Acanthamoeba produced similar cytopathic changes, {{as seen by}} light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. After adhesion to the epithelial surface, trophozoites formed clumps and migrated toward the cell borders, causing the separation of adjacent cells at 1 h of coculture. At later stages (2 to 4 h), some <b>amebae</b> were found under desquamating epithelial cells whereas others were seen associated with damaged cells or forming amebostome-like structures to ingest detached epithelial cells. Control corneas incubated in culture medium conditioned with <b>amebae</b> showed a cytoplasmic vacuolization and blurring of the epithelial-stromal junction. The early stages of corneal epithelial damage caused by <b>amebae</b> were also analyzed by measuring the transepithelial resistance changes in corneas mounted in Ussing chambers. Both species of Acanthamoeba caused a rapid decrease in electrical resistance.

At room temperature, none of the Legionella strains tested grew intracellularly, while an avirulent L. pneumophila strain was unable to replicate in this assay at either temperature. The effect of nutrient limitation on A. castellanii during the assay prevented multiplication of the <b>amebae</b> and increased the level of infection by Legionella spp. The level of infection of the <b>amebae</b> was directly proportional to the multiplicity of infection with bacteria; at an inoculum of 1. 03 x 10 (7) bacteria added to wells containing 1. 10 x 10 (5) <b>amebae</b> (multiplicity of infection of 100), approximately 4. 4 % of A. castellanii cells became infected.
