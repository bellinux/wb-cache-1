5|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, the economy went into decline and the population quickly started to decrease. Between 1989 and 2002, Murmansk Oblast lost almost <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> population; and almost 100,000 more between 2002 and 2010. Nevertheless, the economy rebounded somewhat {{in the first decade of}} the 2000s and the peninsula remains the most industrially developed and urbanized region in northern Russia.|$|E

England responded to their exit from the tournament by replacing a number of veterans with younger players for the 2009 Four Nations. Tomkins, who was then playing at stand-off for Wigan, was included in a new-look squad which featured <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> players aged 21 or below.|$|E

5|$|The {{infusions of}} {{tropical}} moisture from Arizona-bound tropical cyclones {{can be a}} significant portion of the rainfall in the region. In years when hurricanes approach Arizona, eastern and northern portions of the state receive on average 6–8% of the monsoon-season precipitation from tropical systems and their remnants.

5|$|Between 1912 and 1918, Bulgaria became {{involved}} in three consecutive conflicts—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side {{as a result of}} its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories, at Doiran and Dobrich, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses, and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929 due to the effects of these wars, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.|$|E
5|$|Germany lost <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> pre-war (1937) territory. Among {{the eastern}} territories, Silesia, Neumark {{and most of}} Pomerania were taken over by Poland, East Prussia was divided between Poland and the USSR, {{followed}} by the expulsion of the 9 million Germans from these provinces, {{as well as the}} expulsion of 3 million Germans from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia to Germany. By the 1950s, every fifth West German was a refugee from the east. The Soviet Union also took over the Polish provinces east of the Curzon line, from which 2 million Poles were expelled; north-east Romania, parts of eastern Finland, and the three Baltic states were also incorporated into the USSR.|$|E

The production of linoleum continues, though on a greatly reduced scale, under Swiss ownership (Forbo Holding AG). Kirkcaldy Harbour, which closed in 1992, re-opened in October 2011 to cargo ships. A project between Carr's Flour Mills, the parent of Hutchison's, Forth Ports (owners of the harbour) and Transport Scotland, will allow Carr's to bring in wheat via the harbour and remove <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> lorries from the roads every year.|$|E
5|$|One major {{distinguishing}} feature between all loris species is locomotion: the Sunda slow loris moves slowly through trees {{on all four}} limbs, typically with three limbs attached to a support at a time. Its movement {{has been described as}} unique; similar to crawling, or as if it was climbing in every direction, the Sunda slow loris changes direction or moves between branches with little noise or change in speed. In captivity, about <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> time is spent moving quadrupedally, a quarter suspended or hanging, a quarter climbing, and a quarter clasping multiple branches (bridging). It may hang below a branch by one or both feet for long periods of time.|$|E

Zehbe's Dornier alone was claimed nine times. Among the German {{casualties}} {{that day was}} Rolf Heitsch and his flame throwing Dornier; the device had not been tested at high altitude and when used, squirted black oil over Holmes' windshield and {{attracted the attention of}} British fighters. Park would not have been pleased that despite being stripped of protection the small force of bombers lost only <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> strength while surrounded by 100 fighters. Still, the operation had been a victory. Fighter Command lost 13 fighters, eight were claimed by JG 52.|$|E

5|$|His father {{emigrated to}} New York in 1905. The {{rest of the}} family {{followed}} in 1912, except for 17-year old Lazarus who remained in London. From then on, he lived with the family of Joseph Posener at 292 Commercial Road in the East End of London. At the time, the area was a hub of the Jewish diaspora and {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> population were Jews from Central and Eastern Europe. Growing up in the East End, Aaronson was part of a group of friends who are today referred to as the Whitechapel Boys, all of whom were children of Jewish immigrants and shared literary and artistic ambitions. Others in the group who, like Aaronson, later achieved distinction included John Rodker, Isaac Rosenberg, Joseph Leftwich, Samuel Winsten, Clara Birnberg, David Bomberg, and the brothers Abraham and Joseph Fineberg. Aaronson was also involved in the Young Socialist League, where he and other Whitechapel Boys helped organise educational meetings on modern art and radical politics. Aaronson remained a committed socialist throughout adulthood.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is {{primarily}} composed of hydrogen with <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> mass being helium, though helium comprises {{only about a}} tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{civilian}} {{populations in}} the occupied areas were severely persecuted and endured the treacherous conditions of the Eastern Front, which spawned atrocities such as the siege of Leningrad (when more than 1.2 million civilians died). Thousands of peasant villages across Russia, Belarus and Ukraine were annihilated by German troops. During the occupation the Leningrad, Pskov and Novgorod region lost about <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> population. An estimated one-quarter of Soviet civilian deaths {{at the hands of}} the Nazis and their allies (five million Russians, three million Ukrainians and 1.5 million Belarusians) were racially motivated. In 1995 the Russian Academy of Sciences reported that civilian deaths in the occupied USSR, including Jews, {{at the hands of the}} Germans totaled 13.7 million dead (20 percent of the population of 68 million). The figure includes 7.4 million victims of Nazi genocide and reprisals; 2.2 million deaths of persons deported to Germany as forced labour, and 4.1 million famine and disease deaths. An estimated three million people also died of starvation in unoccupied territory. The losses occurred within the 1946–1991 borders of the USSR, and include territories annexed in 1939–40. The deaths of 8.2 million Soviet civilians, including Jews, were documented by the Soviet Extraordinary State Commission.|$|E

50|$|Normal {{space travel}} is realistic, meaning travel between planets {{is a matter}} of months or even years, not hours. FTL is only {{possible}} from a single point in any given star system (within <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> AU <b>of</b> <b>its</b> sun), making it as much a destination to be reached as it is a means of reaching a destination. Different sets of routes each require a specific variation of the device, limiting the effective range of any given interstellar craft. Each use of the device must be planned well in advance of a pre-decided time, meaning one cannot use it to quickly escape from combat. All these factors combine to completely eliminate its effect on gameplay, making it similar to the Alderson Drive of Jerry Pournelle's CoDominium Universe.|$|R
40|$|The {{strategic}} {{significance of}} the Dariali Gorge, the main pass across the central Caucasus, has long been recognised. It forms a border today as it has done {{for much of the}} past 2000 years. But how was an effective military force sustained in an isolated Alpine environment? Excavations, osteoarchaeology and landscape survey have revealed that the Early Middle Ages saw as much investment in controlling this key route as there was in Antiquity. Guarded by the same Muslim-led garrison for at least <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> millennium, <b>its</b> survival in a harsh environment was made possible through military effort and long-distance food supplies...|$|R

40|$|Ankylosing {{spondylitis}} (AS) is {{a socially}} significant rheumatic disease that generally starts in young adults and, if untreated, {{often leads to}} temporary incapacitation, and by 40 years, and to disability. Despite the relatively young age of patients, the course of AS {{is accompanied by a}} number of comorbidities that most commonly include hypertension, dyslipidemia, and involvement of the gastrointestinal tract and kidney. The main group of drugs recommended for the treatment of the disease is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that, when used long, exert analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and even disease-modifying effects {{on the one hand and}} can cause adverse reactions on the other. When choosing NSAIDs, one should consider not only the activity of the pathological process, but also the presence of comorbidities in the patient.
