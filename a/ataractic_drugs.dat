30|$|Conclusions Both NRS and NSCR are {{reliable}} {{indicators of}} pain, and the correspondence between NSCR and actual pain stimulation moreover validates {{the use of}} NSCR {{as a measure of}} pain in patients. However, NRS is also sensitive to the contextual setting and anxiety, which NSCR is not. A discussion, whether to administer analgesic or <b>ataractic</b> <b>drugs</b> during the perioperative stage when NRS is moderate or higher, is warranted.|$|E
40|$|Physicians should {{understand}} the psychic {{as well as}} the chemical effects of <b>ataractic</b> <b>drugs,</b> especially since they are prescribed chiefly for illnesses of emotional origin. The patient may feel that he is “being put off with a pill;” on the other hand, both patient and physician may be encouraged (and thus able to work better together) because the prescription of a drug represents “doing something” about the disorder...|$|E
40|$|The {{psychological}} {{effects of}} abrupt withdrawal of <b>ataractic</b> <b>drugs</b> {{have been studied}} by others. Physical symptoms also occur under such circumstances and include abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Forty patients were divided into four groups of 10, each group receiving {{one of the following}} drugs: chlorpromazine, thioridazine, perphenazine or chlorprothixene. This medication was then suddenly withdrawn. In each of the chlorpromazine and thioridazine groups, three patients had gastrointestinal symptoms within 48 hours, lasting one to eight days. One patient on chlorprothixene, 450 mg. daily, experienced symptoms for six days. Perphenazine withdrawal produced no such symptoms. Thioridazine has little antiemetic action but perphenazine is prescribed for vomiting; hence it seems unlikely that the reported symptoms are due to a rebound action on the vomiting centre...|$|E
40|$|PSYCHOTIC {{patients}} {{have been shown}} to have an excessive incidence of rheumatoid factor and lupus factor in their sera. 1 ' 2 This paper reports the electrophoretic serum protein patterns of chronically psychotic patients who had positive serologic tests for rheumatoid factor and the patterns of certain control groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS A. Patient Material: The following sera of chronically psychotic patients were examined: (1) eighty-four sera known to contain rheumatoid factor (FH-positive group); (2) forty-six sera known not to contain rheumatoid factor or lupus factor (Fll-negative group); (3) twenty-six sera, none of them containing the rheumatoid factor, obtained from a group of schizo-phrenic patients who had had the disease for from two to five years and who had definitely not received <b>ataractic</b> <b>drugs</b> {{during the past two years}} ("no drugs " group); (4) ten sera from male chronic schizophrenics who had had catatonic withdrawal to the point of mutism for from three months to two years in duration ("catatonic " group). The psychiatric diagnoses and medical status (where relevant) of the patients in the Fll-positive and Fll-negative groups have already been published. x B. Controls: An attempt was made to rule out long institutionalization as a factor by using as controls the sera from 50 long-term prisoners in Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. None of these sera was found to contain rheumatoid factor or lupus factor...|$|E
