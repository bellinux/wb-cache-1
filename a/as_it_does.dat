5|$|According to 20th-century folklore, {{the laws}} of {{aerodynamics}} prove the bumblebee should be incapable of flight, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not have the capacity (in terms of wing size or beats per second) to achieve flight with the degree of wing loading necessary.|$|E
5|$|Earth overtakes Jupiter every 398.9 days as it orbits the Sun, a {{duration}} {{called the}} synodic period. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> so, Jupiter appears to undergo retrograde motion {{with respect to}} the background stars.

5|$|Highway3 {{originally}} {{ended at}} the Honeymoon Bridge in Niagara Falls; it continued east of Chambers Corners along Forks Road (Regional Road23) rather than south through Wainfleet <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> today. It then travelled north through Welland and east along Lundys Lane. Highway58 and Highway20 would later follow portions of this route.|$|E

5|$|After {{experiencing}} {{fluctuations in}} the decades immediately after the independence of India, the economies of South Indian states have registered growth {{higher than the national}} average over the past three decades. While South Indian states have improved in some of the socio-economic metrics, poverty continues to affect the region <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> the rest of the country, although it has considerably decreased over the years. Basis the 2011 census, HDI in the southern states is high and the economy has grown at a faster rate than most northern states.|$|E
5|$|Along with Riesling, Sauvignon blanc {{was one of}} {{the first}} fine wines to be bottled with a screwcap in {{commercial}} quantities, especially by New Zealand producers. The wine is usually consumed young, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not particularly benefit from aging, as varietal Sauvignon blancs tend to develop vegetal aromas reminiscent of peas and asparagus with extended aging. Dry and sweet white Bordeaux, including oak-aged examples from Pessac-Léognan and Graves, as well as some Loire wines from Pouilly-Fumé and Sancerre are some of the few examples of Sauvignon blancs with aging potential.|$|E

5|$|Education in Malaysia {{falls under}} the remit of two federal ministries; the Malaysian Ministry of Education is {{responsible}} for primary and secondary education, while the Ministry of Higher Education has oversight over public universities, polytechnic and community colleges.

5|$|In December 2008, Paul Krugman {{released}} his book The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008, arguing that economic {{conditions similar to}} what existed during the earlier part of the 20th century had returned, making Keynesian policy prescriptions more relevant than ever. In February 2009 Robert J. Shiller and George Akerlof published , a book where they argue the current US stimulus package is too small <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> {{not take into account}} Keynes's insight on the importance of confidence and expectations in determining the future behaviour of businesspeople and other economic agents.|$|E
5|$|King {{vultures}}, which {{lack the}} ability to smell carrion, follow the greater yellow-headed vultures to carcasses, where the king vulture tears open {{the skin of the}} dead animal. This allows the smaller greater yellow-headed vulture access to food, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not have a bill strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals. This is an example of mutual dependence between species. It is generally displaced from carcasses by both turkey vultures and king vultures, due to their larger size.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia {{rejected}} Singapore's {{argument that}} the traditional Malay concept of sovereignty was based mainly on control over people and not over territory. It stated that authority in states throughout the world {{is based on a}} combination of control over people and territory, and that this applies to the Malay States <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> to any other state. Since the Johor Sultanate was established in the 16th century, it always had rulers who were recognised as such and who thus commanded people's allegiance and therefore controlled the territory where those people lived.|$|E

5|$|Scientists have debated {{as to how}} sauropods {{were able}} to breathe with their large body sizes and long necks, which would have {{increased}} the amount of dead space.
