40|$|Various {{surgical}} {{techniques have}} been sug-gested for {{the closure of}} oral defects such as pri-mary closure, buccal mucosal graft, split thickness skin graft, <b>allogenic</b> <b>graft,</b> regional rotational flap, and distant flap. The type {{and size of the}} defect de-termine the technique to be used. The use of the buccal fat pad (BFP) as a grafting source in the clo-sure of intra-oral defects has gained popularity {{in the last quarter of}} this century. Because of the ease of access and rich blood supply, its use in oral de-fects is an attractive concept. Its use as a pedicle graft for oral reconstruction was first reported by Egyedi in 1977 [1]. He also recommended cover-age of the exposed BFP with a skin graft. In 1983, Neder [2] reported the use of the BFP as a fre...|$|E
30|$|In {{the recent}} years, several {{alternatives}} {{have been investigated}} to supply the reported disadvantages of autologous bone. Allogenic grafts have been extensively used obtained from individuals from the same species but with different genetic load [23]. An <b>allogenic</b> <b>graft</b> {{is considered to be}} biocompatible with great applicability, exhibits good postoperative response without donor site morbidity, and is available in unlimited quantities [24, 25]. Furthermore, the anorganic bovine bone has received attention in the literature, since it yielded a long-term success in ridge augmentation technique. It is widely used for vertical and horizontal augmentation, sinus lift procedures, and socket treatment after tooth extraction [26]. While for sinus lift procedures bone substitutes have proven to achieve reliable results, we still lack clinical evidence that bone substitutes are equally reliable for horizontal and vertical augmentation of the dentoalveolar process.|$|E

30|$|Several {{approaches}} for alveolar bone regeneration have been studied, including autogenous graft, <b>allogenic</b> <b>graft,</b> xenogenic graft, use of alloplastic materials, and distraction osteogenesis [1 – 3]. Guided bone regeneration (GBR) {{was introduced in}} the context of orthopedic research as early as 1959 [4]. The basic principles of GBR as a surgical procedure were developed by Melcher in 1976 and involve suppressing the growth of unwanted cellular tissues to create space for the growth of the desired tissue [5]. Features of an ideal membrane include easy handling, bio-absorbability, and biofunctionality [6, 7]. Membranes could additionally prevent epithelial cell movement to the bone defect site while permitting osteoblast migration to allow osteoblasts to carry out the regenerative process [8, 9]. Therefore, ideal membranes used in bone tissue regeneration should prevent local tissue cells of the sintered body and other epithelial cells from accessing the bone defect area [10, 11]. However, currently developed resorbable membranes are unable to achieve complete bone regeneration because of an induced inflammatory response caused by inadequate micro-environmental separation [12, 13]. Therefore, the development of a biocompatible membrane that resolves these current limitations is important and necessary.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an {{acquired}} autoimmune disease, with typical histology and immune pathological findings, {{which might be}} associated with drug therapy. The list of responsible drugs increases every year, but a current literature revision {{do not include the}} mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. By converse, bullous pemghigoid cases have been described in renal transplant recipients and associated with the <b>allogenic</b> <b>graft</b> itself, causing a cross reaction against the skin, or unbalancing the immune response, through a chronic cell-mediated suppression, non-specifically favouring the autoantibody production. OBJECT AND RESULTS: Two cases of BP occurred, respectively, 10 days to 2 months after the addition to their current regimen of everolimus in a 35 -year-old woman and sirolimus in a 65 -year-old man. The graft functionality was within normal range. General corticosteroids therapy resistance, immediate improvement after drug discontinuation (dechallenge) and relapse after re-exposure (rechallenge) were striking criteria supporting a causative role of the drugs, grouped in the mTOR inhibitors class. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of drug-induced events is crucial for early management, and particularly bullous eruptions affect patients' health and quality of life. Additional research is necessary to confirm the m-TOR inhibitors association, which exploit the possible mechanisms and eventually point out preventive measures...|$|E
40|$|The present {{work has}} been carried out {{as a result of the}} {{increasing}} use of <b>allogenic,</b> free tendon <b>grafts</b> for primary as well as revision anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery, without sufficient understanding of the biomechanical properties of the grafts. This study investigated the biomechanical properties of autogenous and allogenic, free, fresh-frozen tendon grafts with non-anatomical anchoring (femoral: Endobutton, tibial: cortical bridge) in sheep. 54 mature female merino sheep aged between 2 - 3 years were implanted with free long flexor tendon, replacing their anterior cruciate ligament. After 6, 12 and 52 weeks two loading conditions were simulated: an anterior–posterior (AP) drawer test and a load-to-failure test. The autografts demonstrated less anterior translation during anterior–posterior (AP) drawer test than the allografts at all testing points. At 52 weeks, AP laxity of the allografts was significantly larger than in the knee joint with autologous ACL reconstruction. Likewise, the autografts showed superior results in load-to-failure testing. The one-year autograft group recorded nearly twice as much failure load compared to the one-year allograft group. The contrast was statistically significant. A significant increase was observed in the stiffness of failure load and stress between 12 and 52 weeks in autografts. In comparison, the allograft group showed a reduction in stiffness between 12 and 52 weeks. : Although animal research cannot be directly applied to humans, the results should be taken into consideration. The use of <b>allogenic</b> <b>grafts</b> in primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery, particularly in young, active patients, should be viewed critically.

40|$|OBJECTIVES The aim was {{to compile}} the current {{knowledge}} about the efficacy of different soft tissue correction methods around osseointegrated, already uncovered and/or loaded (OU/L) implants with insufficient soft tissue conditions. Procedures to increase peri-implant keratinized mucosa (KM) width and/or soft tissue volume were considered. MATERIALS AND METHODS Screening of two databases: MEDLINE (PubMed) and EMBASE (OVID), and manual search of articles were performed. Human studies reporting on soft tissue augmentation/correction methods around OU/L implants up to June 30, 2016, were considered. Quality assessment of selected full-text articles to weight risk of bias was performed using the Cochrane collaboration's tool. RESULTS Overall, four randomized controlled trials (risk of bias = high/low) and five prospective studies (risk of bias = high) were included. Depending on the surgical techniques and graft materials, the enlargement of keratinized tissue (KT) ranged between 1. 15  ±  0. 81 and 2. 57  ±  0. 50  mm. The apically positioned partial thickness flap (APPTF), in combination with a free gingival graft (FGG), a subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG), or a xenogeneic graft material (XCM) were most effective. A coronally advanced flap (CAF) combined with SCTG in three, combined with <b>allogenic</b> <b>graft</b> materials (AMDA) in one, and a split thickness flap (STF) combined with SCTG in another study showed mean soft tissue recession coverage rates from 28 to 96. 3...|$|E
40|$|Study design:Cell {{transplantation}} {{strategies are}} gaining increasing interest for {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI) {{with the objective of}} promoting spinal cord repair. To avoid <b>allogenic</b> <b>graft</b> rejection, an adequate immune suppression is required, {{and one of the most}} potent and commonly used immunosuppressives is cyclosporin A (CsA). In SCI, permanent sensory motor loss is combined with modifications of drug absorption, distribution and elimination. Objectives:The objectives of this study were to thoroughly explore histological and functional outcomes of CsA treatment in a rat model of spinal cord compression. Setting: Experiments were carried out at the Institute for Neurosciences of Montpellier (France), the Integrative Biology of Neurodegeneration Laboratory (Spain) and in the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (Switzerland) for CsA blood concentration determination. Methods:We first evaluated histological outcomes of CsA treatment on kidneys and spinal cord after SCI. We then investigated whether SCI modified CsA blood concentration. Finally, using behavioral analysis, we assessed the potential CsA impact on functional recovery. Results:When spinal-cord-injured rats were treated with a CsA dose of 10 mg kg - 1 per day, we observed deleterious effects on kidneys, associated with modifications of CsA blood concentration. Adding an antibiotic treatment reduced kidney alteration without modifying CsA blood concentration. Finally, we showed that CsA treatment per se modified neither functional recovery nor lesion extension. Conclusion:This study pinpoints the absolute requirement of careful CsA monitoring in the clinical setting for patients with SCI to minimize potential unexpected effects and avoid therapeutic failure.

40|$|For the {{clinical}} practice there is uncertainty {{as to what}} degree the therapeutic immunomodulation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) {{is associated with a}} weakening of protective tumor immunity. Neoplasms of the skin in particular are known to exhibit increased incidence rates in association with therapeutic immunosuppression in transplantation medicine; however, the immunosuppression required for the prevention of <b>allogenic</b> <b>graft</b> rejection is much more intensive and thus not directly transferable to the potential risks for an onset or relapse of melanoma or non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), e. g. spinocellular and basal cell carcinomas in association with the antirheumatic treatment of RA. This review covers the association of RA and its pharmacotherapy with conventional synthetic (cs) and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) {{on the basis of a}} systematic literature search. The incidence rates of NMSC are twice as high in biologicnaive RA patients compared to the general population, whereas the respective incidence rates for melanoma do not differ. A biologic treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers compared with administration of csDMARD only has a minor, if any effect on the increase of NMSC risk but is associated with a trend towards an elevated incidence rate of new onset melanoma although significance level was not reached in all of the reviewed studies. The data on non-TNF blocking biologics is sparse. Accordingly, it is inappropriate to draw any strong conclusions on potentially associated skin cancer risks from the present lack of safety signals.

30|$|Mean {{operation}} time in Yildirim’s study was significantly shorter than {{in our study}} (ø 45  min) (Yildirim et al. 2011). No information on intraoperative local adjuvant therapy (e.g. 95  % ethanol) was found in his work. The {{operation time}} in our patients diminished significantly {{over the course of}} time with more experience in the ossoscopic procedure and after the introduction of the speculum. We experienced that meticulous ossoscopic curettage of IOL with resection of dystrophic calcifications was more time-consuming than in UBC. Operation time of our procedure might be additionally cut down by the use of injectable bone substitute but, in our experience, osteointegration is inferior to allogenic bone, adverse effects have been reported (Lee et al. 2002) and, last but not least, cost-effectiveness is mostly disadvantageous (Kurien et al. 2013). Compared to autologous bone or bone substitute, allogenic bone is easily available, affordable and can offer good osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties (Oryan et al. 2014). The major advantage is to avoid sacrificing host tissue and the challenges of donor site morbidity (Greenwald et al. 2001). Disadvantages of <b>allogenic</b> bone <b>grafting</b> include that harvesting and conservation of <b>allogenic</b> <b>grafts</b> might be a limiting factor in some countries (Nandi et al. 2010; Pruss 2007).

40|$|To {{overcome}} {{shortcomings of}} current small-diameter vascular prostheses, {{we developed a}} novel allogenic vascular graft from a decellularized scaffold modified through heparin immobilization and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) coating. The VEGF coating and release profiles were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the biological activity of modified surface was validated by human umbilical vein endothelial cells seeding and proliferation for 10 days in vitro. In vivo, we implanted either a modified or a nonmodified scaffold as bilateral carotid <b>allogenic</b> <b>graft</b> in canines (n [*]=[*] 15). The morphological examination of decellularized scaffolds showed complete removal of cellular components while the extracellular matrix structure remained intact. After modification, the scaffolds possessed local sustained release of VEGF up to 20 days, on which the cells cultured showed significantly higher proliferation rate throughout the time after incubation compared with the cells cultured on nonmodified scaffolds (P [*]<[*] 0. 0001). After 6 months of implantation, the luminal surfaces of modified scaffolds exhibited complete endothelium regeneration, however, only a few disorderly cells and thrombosis overlay the luminal surfaces of nonmodified scaffolds. Specifically, the modified scaffolds exhibited significantly smaller hyperplastic neointima area compared with the nonmodified, not only at midportion (0. 56 [*]±[*] 0. 07 vs. 2. 04 [*]±[*] 0. 12 [*]mm 2, P [*]<[*] 0. 0001), but also at anastomotic sites (1. 76 [*]±[*] 0. 12 vs. 3. 67 [*]±[*] 0. 20 [*]mm 2, P [*]<[*] 0. 0001).

40|$|Introduction: Hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplant}} (HSCT) is frequently complicated by endocrine abnormalities {{and loss of}} bone mass. This prospective {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the bone loss post-HSCT. Materials and Methods: A total of 50 patients was evaluated pretransplantation, and 25 had HSCT (17 males, 8 females; 19 allogenic, 6 autologous). Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone markers were measured at baseline, 3 - 6 months and 12 months. Results: The mean age and body mass index were 25. 1 ± 16. 3 years and 19. 4 ± 4. 5 kg/m 2, respectively. There were 15 adults (60 %), and 10 adolescents (40 %). There was a significant decline in BMD from the baseline at total femur (− 8. 7 %; P < 0. 0001), femoral neck (− 5. 0 %; P = 0. 003), femoral trochanter (− 6. 0 %; P = 0. 001), and Ward′s triangle (− 9. 9 %; P < 0. 0001) at 6 months posttransplantation. From the 6 months to 12 months, there was a significant improvement in BMD at above sites except at Ward′s triangle. The decline in BMD was nonsignificant at the whole body (− 0. 3 %, P = 0. 748) and the lumbar spine (− 2. 7 %, P = 0. 130) at 6 months posttransplant. Younger patients with <b>allogenic</b> <b>graft</b> and steroid use {{are more likely to have}} significant loss of BMD at hip posttransplant. Serum osteocalcin decreased, and N-telopeptide increased at 3 - 6 months, which return to baseline at 1 -year posttransplant. Conclusions: A significant bone loss is observed at 6 months in patients with post-HSCT. The bone loss occurs predominantly at cortical bone. There is recovery of bone mass at 12 months posttransplant except at Ward′s triangle. Bone loss after HSCT is multifactorial...|$|E
40|$|AIM: The aim of {{the present}} review was to {{systematically}} assess the dental literature in terms of soft tissue grafting techniques. The focused question was: is one method superior over others for augmentation and stability of the augmented soft tissue in terms of increasing the width of keratinized tissue (part 1) and gain in soft tissue volume (part 2). METHODS: A Medline search was performed for human studies focusing on augmentation of keratinized tissue and/or soft tissue volume, and complemented by additional hand searching. Relevant studies were identified and statistical results were reported for meta-analyses including the test minus control weighted mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals, the I-squared statistic for tests of heterogeneity, {{and the number of}} significant studies. RESULTS: Twenty-five (part 1) and three (part 2) studies met the inclusion criteria; 14 studies (part 1) were eligible for comparison using meta-analyses. An apically positioned flap/vestibuloplasty (APF/V) procedure resulted in a statistically significantly greater gain in keratinized tissue than untreated controls. APF/V plus autogenous tissue revealed statistically significantly more attached gingiva compared with untreated controls and a borderline statistical significance compared with APF/V plus allogenic tissue. Statistically significantly more shrinkage was observed for the APF/V plus <b>allogenic</b> <b>graft</b> compared with the APF/V plus autogenous tissue. Patient-centered outcomes did not reveal any of the treatment methods to be superior regarding postoperative complications. The three studies reporting on soft tissue volume augmentation could not be compared due to lack of homogeneity. The use of subepithelial connective tissue grafts (SCTGs) resulted in statistically significantly more soft tissue volume gain compared with free gingival grafts (FGGs). CONCLUSIONS: APF/V is a successful treatment concept to increase the width of keratinized tissue or attached gingiva around teeth. The addition of autogenous tissue statistically significantly increases the width of attached gingiva. For soft tissue volume augmentation, only limited data are available favoring SCTGs over FGG...|$|E

We {{set out to}} determine {{the nature of these}} particles, as there are few studies which identify virus in tendons per se, and their presence could have implications for tissue-engineering using <b>allogenic</b> <b>grafts.</b> Methods: Virus particles were identified in electron microscopy of TETCs. Virion morphology was used to initially hypothesise the virus identity.   Next generation sequencing was implemented to identify the virus. A pan herpesvirus PCR was used to validate the RNASeq findings using an independent platform. Histological analysis and biochemical analysis was undertaken on the TETCs. Results: Morphological features suggested the virus to be either a retrovirus or herpesvirus. Subsequent next generation sequencing mapped reads to Equid herpesvirus 2 (EHV 2). Histological examination and biochemical testing for collagen content revealed no significant differences between virally affected TETCs and non-affected TETCs. An independent set of equine superficial digital flexor tendon tissue (n= 10) examined using designed primers for specific EHV 2 contigs identified at sequencing were negative. These data suggest that EHV is resident in some equine tendon. Conclusions: EHV 2 was demonstrated in equine tenocytes for the first time; likely from in vivo infection.

Past studies have mainly been based on histological or molecular biological methods. Imaging techniques to monitor allograft pathology have rarely been used. Here we investigated mice after isogenic and allogenic ktx over time with functional MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and mapping of T 2 -relaxation time (T 2 -mapping) to assess graft inflammation and edema formation. To characterize graft pathology, we used PAS-staining, counted CD 3 -positive T-lymphocytes, analyzed leukocytes by means flow cytometry. DWI revealed progressive restriction of diffusion of water molecules in <b>allogenic</b> kidney <b>grafts.</b> This was paralleled by enhanced infiltration of the kidney by inflammatory cells. Changes in tissue diffusion were not seen following isogenic ktx.

Objective: Anatomical, functional and esthetic rehabilitation of patients after mandibular resection Method: Revascularization of free fibula graft by microvascular anastomosis of paroneal artery with facial artery at the segmental defect site of mandible. Result: Remarkable contour, cosmesis and early functional rehabilatation of the patient. Conclusion: Microvascular reconstruction with fibula is the better option for defect correction and early rehabilitation in patients with mandibular continuity defect.

40|$|The use of {{autograft}} for posterolateral spinal fusion, continue {{being considered}} {{the gold standard}} for the treatment of spine pathologies. However, due to complications such as donor site morbidity, increased operating time, and limited supply, the use of allograft has become an acceptable practice especially in multisegment arthrodesis or in patients with previous graft harvests. Since their use involves the risk of immune response or disease transmission and fusion rates are not as good as with autogenous bone, a variety of bone graft substitutes are being studied to obtain a better alternative. Osteoinductive growth factors, which initiate the molecular cascade of bone formation and {{play a key role in}} the development and regeneration of the skeletal system, have been shown to be effective in numerous animal studies. These molecules must be used in combination with a biomaterial to avoid their dispersion from the application site. On the other hand, it is well known that cultured bone marrow cells, harvested from adult bone marrow, may contribute to the regeneration of bone. Thus, hybrid constructs can be used as alternatives to autologous and <b>allogenic</b> <b>grafts.</b> In this study, we have evaluated different combination of cultured bone marrow cells with recombinant human osteoinductive growth factors, all of them in combination with a natural polimeric carrier, for the promotion of posterolateral spinal fusion in rats.

40|$|Decalcified <b>Allogenic</b> Bone <b>grafts</b> were {{implanted}} {{in and around}} eighteen root apices after apicoectomy. The procedure was carried out on eighteen rabbits, dividing them into three groups of six rabbits each. The animals were sacrificed after 48 - 72 hours, 8 - 10 days & 8 - 10 weeks period of interval. Result of the present investigation reveal that DABM grafts stimulate osteogenesis and cementogenesis after the initial phase of inflammation. Tissues simulating bone and cementum appear at the apical end, speculating that the grafts would certainly result in physiological sealing of root apices. The possibility of saving the life of non vital teeth with or without wide apical foramen will enhance in future...|$|R
30|$|Limitations of {{this study}} include the small sample number, the short {{follow-up}} (ø 19.8  m) and the retrospective study design without control cases. A randomized controlled study with a larger sample number will be necessary for the future comparing injectable bone substitute and <b>allogenic</b> cancellous bone <b>grafting</b> for ossoscopic treatment of calcaneal UBC and IOL. The nature of calcaneal UBC and IOL, often unsymptomatic and rare, will hinder this project, though.|$|R
40|$|Various methods, such as vascularized bone transfers, Illizarov bone transport, <b>allogenic</b> bone <b>grafts,</b> {{bone graft}} substitutes, are {{available}} in treating traumatic bone loss. Free non-vascularised fibular graft is an autografting method that only requires minimal facilities or expertise. However, this method is not popularized due to its avascular property {{and there is not}} many reports regarding its use in treating a large traumatic bone loss. We reported a case in our center to demonstrate its possibility of successfully treating the traumatic radial bone loss in pediatric patient. Patient had good recovery with the regain of good range of movement of forearm and there is no harvest site morbidity after two years of follow up.
