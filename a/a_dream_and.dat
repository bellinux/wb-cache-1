5|$|Scholars {{have found}} it {{extremely}} difficult to assign one specific, overarching theme to the play. Proposals for a main theme include a discovery by the characters {{that human beings are}} neither wholly good nor wholly evil, but instead are more or less alike, awaking out of <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> <b>and</b> into reality, the danger of hasty action, or the power of tragic fate. None of these have widespread support. However, even if an overall theme cannot be found {{it is clear that the}} play is full of several small, thematic elements that intertwine in complex ways. Several of those most often debated by scholars are discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Some pundits {{have argued}} that the top was not in fact Cobb's totem, {{rendering}} the discussion irrelevant. They say that the top was Mal's totem; Cobb's was his wedding ring, as he can be seen wearing it whenever he is in <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> <b>and</b> without it whenever he isn't. As he hands his passport to the immigration officer, his hand is shown with no ring; thus he was conclusively in reality when seeing his children. Furthermore, the children were portrayed by different actors, indicating they had aged.|$|E
5|$|Stories also link Bahuchara {{to gender}} {{variance}} after she becomes divine. One myth concerns a king who prayed to Bahuchara for a son. Bahuchara complied, but the prince {{grew up to}} be impotent. One night Bahuchara appeared to the prince in <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> <b>and</b> ordered him to cut off his genitals, wear women's clothes and become her servant. Bahuchara is believed to continue to identify impotent men and command them to do the same. If they refuse, she punishes them: for their next seven incarnations they will be impotent. This myth is the origin of the cult of Bahuchara Mata, whose devotees are required to self-castrate and remain celibate.|$|E

5|$|The Fountain also stars Ellen Burstyn as Dr. Lillian Guzetti, Tom's superior, and Mark Margolis as Father Avila, who accompanies Tomás the conquistador. Burstyn and Margolis {{appeared}} in Aronofsky's Requiem for <b>a</b> <b>Dream,</b> <b>and</b> the director wrote into the script roles {{for both of}} them. Sean Patrick Thomas, Donna Murphy, and Ethan Suplee were cast as assistants to Tom's lab work. Cliff Curtis was cast as Captain Ariel, a fellow conquistador, and Stephen McHattie was cast as Grand Inquisitor Silecio, a religious fanatic who threatens the Spanish queen. Seventy extras were cast as Maya warriors, including twenty who had actual Guatemala Mayan backgrounds. One of the twenty, a real-life spiritual leader, was cast as the Maya spiritual leader in the film.|$|E
5|$|Two {{stories from}} the 19th century {{continue}} this theme: In the Sōzan Chomon Kishū, a boy is carried off by a tengu and spends three years with the creature. He comes home with a magic gun that never misses a shot. A story from Inaba Province, related by Inoue Enryō, tells of a girl with poor manual dexterity who is suddenly possessed by a tengu. The spirit wishes to rekindle the declining art of swordsmanship in the world. Soon a young samurai appears to whom the tengu has appeared in <b>a</b> <b>dream,</b> <b>and</b> the possessed girl instructs him as an expert swordsman. Some rumors surrounding the ninja indicate that they were also instructed by the tengu.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, in 832 A.D. Óengus II led {{an army of}} Picts and Scots {{into battle}} against the Angles, led by Æthelstan, near modern-day Athelstaneford, East Lothian. The legend states that whilst engaged in prayer {{on the eve of}} battle, Óengus vowed that if granted victory he would appoint Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland; Andrew then {{appeared}} to Óengus that night in <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> <b>and</b> assured him of victory. On the morning of battle white clouds forming the shape of an X were said to have appeared in the sky. Óengus and his combined force, emboldened by this apparent divine intervention, took to the field and despite being inferior in terms of numbers were victorious. Having interpreted the cloud phenomenon as representing the crux decussata upon which Saint Andrew was crucified, Óengus honoured his pre-battle pledge and duly appointed Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland. The white saltire set against a celestial blue background {{is said to have been}} adopted as the design of the flag of Scotland on the basis of this legend.|$|E

5|$|As per Tulsidas, Rama is the {{efficient}} and material cause (Nimitta and Upadana) of the world, which is real since Rama is real. In several verses of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas {{says that the}} animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors interpret these verses to mean {{that the world is}} real according to Tulsidas, in keeping with the Vishishtadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja. However, at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali, Tulsidas compares the world to a night or <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> <b>and</b> says it is Mithya (false or unreal). Some commentators interpret these verses to mean that in Tulsidas' opinion the world is unreal as per the Vivartavada doctrine of Adi Shankara, while some others interpret them to mean that the world is transient yet real as per the Satkhyativada doctrine of Ramananda. Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas' view, the world is essentially the form of Rama and appears to be different from Rama due to Maya. Its visible form is transient, which is what Tulsidas means by Mithya.|$|E
5|$|Between 2008 and 2010, Evancho entered talent competitions, {{sang the}} U.S. {{national}} anthem at a Pittsburgh Pirates baseball game, gave concerts with Tim Janis and David Foster, issued her first album, Prelude to <b>a</b> <b>Dream,</b> <b>and</b> attracted interest on YouTube. In 2010, {{at the age}} of ten, she gained wide notice with her 2nd-place finish in the fifth season of America's Got Talent. With the 2010 holiday release of her O Holy Night EP, Evancho became the best-selling debut artist of 2010, the youngest top-10 debut artist in U.S. history and the youngest solo artist ever to go platinum in the U.S. She performed at the 2010 National Christmas Tree lighting in Washington, D.C. In 2011, her first full-length album, Dream With Me, produced by Foster, debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart, and she became the youngest top-5 debut artist in UK history. Billboard ranked Evancho the top Classical Albums Artist for 2011. Later that year, Evancho released a full-length holiday album, Heavenly Christmas, and became the youngest person ever to give a solo concert at Lincoln Center in New York City as part of her Dream With Me Tour.|$|E
5|$|Parsifal {{wonders if}} the Garden is <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> <b>and</b> asks {{how it is that}} Kundry knows his name. Kundry tells him she learned it from his mother (""), who had loved him and tried to shield him from his father's fate, the mother he had {{abandoned}} and who had finally died of grief. She reveals many parts of Parsifal's history to him and he is stricken with remorse, blaming himself for his mother's death. He thinks himself very stupid to have forgotten her. Kundry says this realization is a first sign of understanding and that, with a kiss, she can help him understand his mother's love. As they kiss Parsifal suddenly recoils in pain and cries out Amfortas' name: he feels the wounded king's pain burning in his own side and now understands Amfortas' passion during the Grail Ceremony (""). Filled with this compassion, Parsifal rejects Kundry's advances.|$|E

5|$|The growing {{popularity}} of worship of a more benign form of Kaali, as Daksinakali, is often attributed to Krishnananda Agamavagisha. He was a noted Bengali leader of the 17th century, author of a Tantra encyclopedia called Tantrasara. According to hearsay - Kaali appeared to him in <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> <b>and</b> told him to popularize her in a particular form that would appear to him the following day. The next morning he observed a young woman making cow dung patties. While placing a patty on a wall, {{she stood in the}} alidha pose, with her right foot forward. When she saw Krishnananda watching her, she was embarrassed and put her tongue between her teeth. Krishnananada took his previous worship of Kali out of the cremation grounds and into a more domestic setting. Krishnananda Vagamavagisha was also the guru of the Kaali devotee and poet Ramprasad Sen.|$|E
5|$|Mother {{begins with}} the story of a young, married, American couple who mysteriously vanish from their small, rural town. Two years later, the husband, George, {{returned}} as mysteriously as he vanished, and began a strange study in complete seclusion. His wife, Maria, was never heard from again. Years later, in the late 1980s (dated specifically as 1988 in the Famicom version, but kept ambiguous in later releases), a young American boy named Ninten is attacked at home in a paranormal event. His father explains that Ninten's great-grandfather studied psychic powers, and asks Ninten to investigate a crisis occurring across the world, later revealed to be the work of an invading alien race. After finishing a few tasks, Ninten is warped to the world of Magicant, where the land's ruler, Queen Mary, asks Ninten to find her song, the Eight Melodies, and play them for her. Ninten returns to Earth and befriends a young boy, Lloyd, who is being teased at an elementary school. The two travel to the town of Snowman to deliver a lost hat to Ana, a young girl with psychic powers. Ana tells Ninten she saw him in <b>a</b> <b>dream,</b> <b>and</b> joins the party in hopes of finding her missing mother.|$|E
