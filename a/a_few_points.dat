The dual-screen mode was highly regarded, the mission design was praised, and the emotional presence of the story was also recognized. However, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>points</b> were docked due to the general lack of diverse unit types, and the game's system requirements.

25|$|Sabatini had {{a strong}} start to 1991, winning five tournaments {{in the first half}} of the year. She reached her third grand slam singles final at Wimbledon and yet again faced Graf who prevailed in three sets, despite the fact that Sabatini served for the match twice. Sabatini came close to {{attaining}} the World No. 1 ranking in 1991, but was narrowly denied by Graf and then Monica Seles.

Before the advent of electronic calculators and computers, these provided a useful way to extract {{much of the information}} from a sample with minimal labour. These remained in practical use through the early and mid 20th century, when automated sorting of punch card data was possible, but computation remained difficult, and is still of use today, for estimates given a list of numerical values in non-machine-readable form, where data input is more costly than manual sorting. They also allow rapid estimation.|$|E

Ray's consistent optimism, sexual bravado, unwavering confidence, privileged upbringing, simple attitudes, and good luck makes him seem on the surface a complete antithesis of character to Roast Beef. Regardless, the two have been close friends since childhood, and it may be observed that as the strip progresses, each occasionally adopts the attitudes and perspectives of the other. The two do, of course, have <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>points</b> of dissent: Roast Beef is somewhat more sympathetic to Little Nephew than his Uncle Ray, and has taken issue with Ray's alcoholism.|$|E

With Republicans {{taking control of the}} U.S. Senate, Packwood was in line to become chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.

Pe'er looked on-form for victory when she went up 6–5 in the final set, and just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>points</b> from her first major semi-final, but it was Williams who then showed her fighting spirit by winning the next three games to wrap up the 3–6, 6–2, 8–6 victory and {{become one of the}} ten lowest-ranked women in the Open Era to compete in a Grand Slam semi-final.|$|E
