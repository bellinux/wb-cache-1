25|$|While the American {{working class}} has {{lost much of}} its {{political}} strength with the decline of labor unions, it remains a stronghold of the Democratic Party and continues as {{an essential part of the}} Democratic base. Today, roughly a third of the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> estimated to be working class with around 52% being either members of the working or lower classes. Yet, as those with lower socioeconomic status are less likely to vote, the working and lower classes are underrepresented in the electorate. The working class is largely distinguished by highly routinized and closely supervised work. It consists mainly of clerical and blue-collar workers. Even though most in the working class are able to afford an adequate standard of living, high economic insecurity and possible personal benefit from an extended social safety net, make the majority of working class person left-of-center on economic issues. Most working class Democrats differ from most liberals, however, in their more socially conservative views. Working class Democrats tend to be more religious and likely to belong to an ethnic minority. Socially conservative and disadvantaged Democrats are among the least educated and lowest earning ideological demographics. In 2005, only 15% had a college degree, compared to 27% at the national average and 49% of liberals, respectively. Together socially conservative and the financially disadvantaged comprised roughly 54% of the Democratic base. The continued importance of the working class votes manifests itself in recent CNN exit polls, which shows that the majority of those with low incomes and little education vote for the Democratic Party.|$|E

Biden stated earlier in his campaign that [...] " [...] truly believe the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> waiting for leaders to come along who have the experience to say what they will do to restore America's leadership in the world." [...] At times during his campaign he believed his experience would help him win the Democratic nomination, but when Barack Obama's campaign began to surge with the candidate's emphasis on change, Biden shifted his focus from his experience in politics to his ability for action. He stated during a November 2007 debate, [...] "This [...] is not about experience. It's not about change. It's about action.

Prior to 1920, home runs were unusual, and managers tried to win games {{by getting a}} runner on base and bringing him around to score through such means as the stolen base, the bunt, and the hit and run. Advocates of what was dubbed [...] "inside baseball", such as Giants manager McGraw, disliked the home run, considering it a blot on {{the purity of the}} game. According to sportswriter W. A. Phelon, after the 1920 season, Ruth's breakout performance that season and the response in excitement and attendance, [...] "settled, for all time to come, that the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> nuttier over the Home Run than the Clever Fielding or the Hitless Pitching. Viva el Home Run and two times viva Babe Ruth, exponent of the home run, and overshadowing star." [...] Bill James noted, [...] "When the owners discovered that the fans liked to see home runs, and when the foundations of the games were simultaneously imperiled by disgrace , then there was no turning back." [...] While a few, such as McGraw and Cobb, decried the passing of the old-style play, teams quickly began to seek and develop sluggers.|$|E

2500|$|February 9 - Enrique Dupuy de Lôme, the Spanish {{ambassador}} to the United States, is forced to resign after the De Lôme Letter is published in the New York Journal. This document, a private letter written to friend in Cuba, characterizes U.S. President McKinley as [...] "weak" [...] and a [...] "would-be politician" [...] who catered to the most jingoistic elements of the Republican Party and public. The <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> outraged at the depiction of the United States as immature, militarily weak, and lacking in diplomatic skill.

[...] The result was the Gate of Horn {{in the basement of the}} Rice Hotel, where Jim (later Roger) McGuinn began his career as a 12-string guitarist. Grossman moved into managing some of the acts who appeared at his club and in 1959 — including an eighteen-year-old Joan Baez, who got her first major break with him —, he joined forces with George Wein, who had founded the Newport Jazz Festival, to start up the Newport Folk Festival. At the first Newport Folk Festival, Grossman told New York Times critic Robert Shelton: [...] "The <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> like Sleeping Beauty, waiting to be kissed awake by the prince of folk music." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{there are}} other things besides the {{parallel}} of Prussia or the problem of Ireland. The American press is much freer than our own; the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> much more familiar with the discussion of corruption than our own; and it is much more conscious of the corruption of our politics than we are. Almost any man in America may speak of the Marconi Case; many a man in England does not even know what it means. Many imagine that {{it had something to do}} with the propriety of politicians speculating on the Stock Exchange. So that it means a great deal to Americans to say that one figure in that drama is ruling India and another is ruling Palestine. And this brings me to another problem, which is also dealt with much more openly in America than in England. I mention it here only because it is a perfect model of the misunderstandings in the modern world. If any one asks for an example of exactly how the important part of every story is left out, and even the part that is reported is not understood, he could hardly have a stronger case than the story of Henry Ford of Detroit.|$|E
