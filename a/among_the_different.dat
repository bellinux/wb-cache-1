During her interview, Durran opined that all the women wear white at the Netherfield Ball due to its contemporary popularity, an idea that Wright credits as his reason for hiring her. All of the costumes were handmade, as clothing was at the time. However, costumes and hairstyles were adjusted to appeal to contemporary audiences, sacrificing historical accuracy.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bird species}} migrate to take {{advantage}} of global differences of seasonal temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat. These migrations vary <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> groups. Many landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs.|$|E

5|$|Various {{forms of}} Chinese {{architecture}} exist throughout Indonesia with marked differences between {{urban and rural}} areas and <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> islands. Architectural developments by the Chinese in Southeast Asia differ from those in mainland China. By blending local and European (Dutch) design patterns, numerous variations of fusion styles emerged. Chinese architecture in Indonesia has manifested in three forms: religious temples, study halls, and houses. Cities during the colonial period were divided into three racial districts: European, oriental (Arabs, Chinese, and other Asians), and indigenous. There usually were no physical boundaries among the zones, except for rivers, walls, or roads in some cases. Such legal boundaries promoted high growths in urban density within each zone, especially in the Chinese quarters, often leading to poor environmental conditions.|$|E

These already wide divides were a fertile breeding ground to inculcate pride in one's identity based on 'race'. This served the British in two ways. On the one hand it made sure that there was no repetition of the Indian rebellion of 1857 by ensuring there was no unity <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> subjects of the Raj.
