5|$|After a brief {{stay with}} the Danish consul, the family were shipped to a refugee camp {{on the island of}} Büyükada in the Dardanelles Strait near Istanbul, Turkey, where the Kulikovsky family shared three rooms with eleven other adults. After two weeks, they were {{evacuated}} to Belgrade in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Regent Alexander Karageorgevich, later to become King Alexander I, offered them a permanent home there, but Dowager Empress Marie summoned her daughter to Denmark. The Grand Duchess complied, and the family arrived in Copenhagen on Good Friday 1920. They lived with Kulikovsky's mother-in-law, Dowager Empress Marie, at first at the Amalienborg Palace <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> royal estate of Hvidøre. Kulikovsky and Marie did not get along; he was resentful of his wife acting as Marie's secretary and companion, and Marie was distant toward him.|$|E

5|$|Educated at Eton College <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Browning was {{commissioned}} {{as a second}} lieutenant into the Grenadier Guards in 1915. During the First World War, he fought on the Western Front, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for conspicuous gallantry during the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917. In September 1918, he became aide de camp to General Sir Henry Rawlinson. After the war, he competed in the bobsleigh at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland, in which his team finished tenth. He married Daphne du Maurier in July 1932.|$|E
5|$|Farrell {{graduated}} from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute {{with a degree}} in civil engineering in 1912. During World War I, he served with the 1st Engineers on the Western Front, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the French Croix de guerre. After the war, he was an instructor at the Engineer School, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> United States Military Academy at West Point. He resigned from the Regular Army in 1926 to become Commissioner of Canals and Waterway for the State of New York from 1926 to 1930, and head of construction and engineering of the New York State Department of Public Works from 1930 until 1941.|$|E

5|$|Greenglass married Ruth Printz in 1942, {{when she}} was 18 years old. The two joined the Young Communist League shortly before Greenglass entered the U.S. Army in April 1943. They had {{a son and a}} daughter. He worked as a {{machinist}} at Fort Ord, California, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi Ordnance Plant in Jackson, Mississippi. In July 1944, Greenglass was assigned to the secret Manhattan Project, the wartime project to develop the first atomic weapons. He was first stationed at the Clinton Engineer Works uranium enrichment facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, but was there for less than two weeks. In August 1944 he was sent to the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. In order to pass his security clearance, he disguised or omitted details of his communist associations, and had friends write glowing references.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 and 1918, Sybil Thorndike {{played the}} role at Old Vic <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Prince's Theatre in 1926.

In 1955, Vivien Leigh played Lady Macbeth opposite Laurence Olivier at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. In 1977 at The Other Place in Stratford, Judi Dench and Ian McKellen played the infamous husband and wife in Trevor Nunn's production. Other notable Lady Macbeths in the late 20th century included Judith Anderson, Pamela Brown, Diana Wynyard, Simone Signoret, Vivien Merchant, Jane Lapotaire, Helen Mirren and Janet Suzman.|$|E
5|$|Sayers {{was educated}} at home <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Oxford. This was {{unusual for a}} woman at the time, as they were not {{admitted}} as full members of the university until 1920 – five years after Sayers had completed her first class degree in medieval French. In 1916, a year after her graduation, Sayer published her first book, a collection of poems entitled Op. I, which she followed two years later with a second, a slim volume titled Catholic Tales and Christian Songs. The same year she was invited to edit and contribute to the annual editions of Oxford Poetry, which she did for the next three years. In 1923 she published Whose Body?, a murder mystery novel featuring the fictional Lord Peter Wimsey, and went on to write eleven novels and five collections of short stories about the character. The Wimsey stories were popular, and successful enough for Sayers to leave the advertising agency where she was working.|$|E

5|$|Wheeler {{earned his}} {{doctorate}} at Johns Hopkins University {{under the supervision}} of Karl Herzfeld, and studied under Breit and Bohr on a National Research Council fellowship. In 1939 he teamed up with Bohr to write a series of papers using the liquid drop model to explain the mechanism of fission. During World War II, he worked with the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, where he helped design nuclear reactors, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Hanford Site in Richland, Washington, where he helped DuPont build them. He returned to Princeton after the war ended, but returned to government service to help design and build the hydrogen bomb in the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Adamant was {{commissioned}} in November 1779 {{under the command}} of Captain Gideon Johnstone, and sailed for North America on 13 August 1780. She was with Vice-Admiral Mariot Arbuthnot's squadron at the Battle of Cape Henry on 16 March 1781, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of the Chesapeake on 5 September 1781. Johnstone was succeeded by Captain David Graves in February 1782, while Adamant was still in North America, after which she returned to Britain as a convoy escort in December 1782. The ship was then paid off in April 1783 and refitted for foreign service between May and September that year. Adamant recommissioned in June 1783 under Captain William Kelly, and on the completion of her refit, sailed to the Leeward Islands in November, where she spent the next three years as the flagship of Admiral Sir Richard Hughes. She was paid off again in September 1786 and underwent a great repair, followed by being fitted out as the flagship at Sheerness from August 1787 to May 1789. Adamant was recommissioned in February 1789 by Captain David Knox, after which Admiral Hughes again hoisted his flag in her and sailed her to Nova Scotia in June. From January 1792 the ship was under Captain Charles Hope, until returning to Britain in June that year and being paid off.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Gilbert {{travelled}} to Italy in 1838 {{and then}} France {{for two years}} with his parents, who finally returned to settle in London in 1847. He was educated at Boulogne, France, {{from the age of}} seven (he later kept his diary in French so that the servants could not read it), then at Western Grammar School, Brompton, London, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Great Ealing School, where he became head boy and wrote plays for school performances and painted scenery. He then attended King's College London, graduating in 1856. He intended to take the examinations for a commission in the Royal Artillery, but {{with the end of the}} Crimean War, fewer recruits were needed, and the only commission available to Gilbert would have been in a line regiment. Instead he joined the Civil Service: he was an assistant clerk in the Privy Council Office for four years and hated it. In 1859 he joined the Militia, a part-time volunteer force formed for the defence of Britain, with which he served until 1878 (in between writing and other work), reaching the rank of Captain. In 1863 he received a bequest of £300 that he used to leave the civil service and take up a brief career as a barrister (he had already entered the Inner Temple as a student), but his legal practice was not successful, averaging just five clients a year.|$|E

First, we assume that <b>the</b> MP starts <b>at</b> <b>the</b> NCP state, it may stay <b>at</b> <b>the</b> NCP state by action A; it may go to the pre-ECPS state by action B <b>and</b> <b>then</b> arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ECPS state by action C; or it may go to the pre-DP state by action D <b>and</b> <b>then</b> arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> DP state by action E.

5|$|By August 9, the {{production}} {{was already a}} full day behind schedule. Despite the delays, Wise refused to shoot more than twelve hours on set, feeling he lost his edge afterwards. The director was patient on set; bets were placed on when he would finally lose his temper, but pool organizers returned the money when Wise never lost his cool. Given his unfamiliarity with the source material Wise relied on the actors, especially Shatner, to help ensure that dialog and characterizations {{were consistent with the}} show. While the bridge scenes were shot early, trouble with filming the transporter room scene delayed further work. Crew working on the transporter platform found their footwear melting on the lighted grid while shooting tests. Issues with the wormhole sequences caused further delays. The footage for the scene was filmed two ways; first, at the standard 24frames per second, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> faster 48frames; the normal footage was a back-up if the slow-motion effect produced by the faster frame speed did not turned out as planned. The shoot dragged on so long that it became a running joke for cast members to try and top each other with wormhole-related puns. The scene was finally completed on August 24, while the transporter scenes were being filmed at the same time on the same soundstage.|$|E
5|$|Olga and {{her husband}} refused to leave Russia, and {{decided to move to}} the Caucasus, which the White Army had cleared of revolutionary Bolsheviks. An {{imperial}} bodyguard, Timofei Yatchik, guided them to his hometown, the large Cossack village of Novominskaya. In a rented five-room farmhouse there, Olga gave birth to her second son, Guri Nikolaevich, on 23 April 1919. He was named after a friend of hers, Guri Panayev, who was killed while serving in the Akhtyrsky Regiment during World War I. In November 1919, the family set out on what would be their last journey through Russia. Just ahead of revolutionary troops, they escaped to Novorossiysk, and took refuge in the residence of the Danish consul, Thomas Schytte, who informed them of the Dowager Empress's safe arrival in Denmark. After a brief stay with the consul, the family were shipped to a refugee camp on the island of Büyükada in the Dardanelles Strait near Istanbul, Turkey, where Olga, her husband and children shared three rooms with eleven other adults. After two weeks, they were evacuated to Belgrade in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes where she was visited by Regent Alexander Karadjordjevich, later King Alexander I of Yugoslavia. Alexander offered the Grand Duchess and her family a permanent home, but Olga was summoned to Denmark by her mother. On Good Friday 1920, Olga and her family arrived in Copenhagen. They lived with the Dowager Empress, at first at the Amalienborg Palace <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> royal estate of Hvidøre, where Olga acted as her mother's secretary and companion. It was a difficult arrangement at times. The Dowager Empress insisted on having Olga at her beck and call and found Olga's young sons too boisterous. Having never reconciled with the idea of her daughter's marriage to a commoner, she was cold towards Kulikovsky, rarely allowing him in her presence. At formal functions, Olga was expected to accompany her mother alone.|$|E
