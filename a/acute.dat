5|$|<b>Acute</b> leukemias of {{ambiguous}} lineage (also {{known as}} mixed phenotype or biphenotypic <b>acute</b> leukemia) {{occur when the}} leukemic cells can not be classified as either myeloid or lymphoid cells, or where both types of cells are present.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin {{overdose}} can be <b>acute</b> or chronic. In <b>acute</b> poisoning, {{a single}} large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, {{higher than normal}} doses are taken {{over a period of}} time. <b>Acute</b> overdose has a mortality rate of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children. Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including activated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis. The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30–100mg/l after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300mg/l in people taking high doses and 700–1400mg/l following <b>acute</b> overdose. Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate, methyl salicylate, and sodium salicylate.|$|E
5000|$|In Lithuanian, {{the initial}} accent was {{preserved}} {{in all cases}} that the ending did not contain an <b>acuted</b> syllable. In the forms that had an <b>acuted</b> ending (nominative, vocative and instrumental singular, accusative plural), the accent shifted onto the ending, {{in accordance with the}} rule discovered by de Saussure. Later, that <b>acuted</b> syllable was shortened by Leskiens law.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the root}} was not <b>acuted,</b> by the {{operation}} of de Saussure's law, the accent shifted onto all the <b>acuted</b> endings in the paradigm, so these nouns belong to the fourth accent paradigm.|$|R

5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are also}} used to treat the <b>acute</b> panic caused by {{hallucinogen}} intoxication. Benzodiazepines {{are also used}} to calm the acutely agitated individual and can, if required, be given via an intramuscular injection. They can sometimes be effective in the short-term treatment of psychiatric emergencies such as <b>acute</b> psychosis as in schizophrenia or mania, bringing about rapid tranquillization and sedation until the effects of lithium or neuroleptics (antipsychotics) take effect. Lorazepam is most commonly used but clonazepam is sometimes prescribed for <b>acute</b> psychosis or mania; their long-term use is not recommended due to risks of dependence. Further research investigating the use of benzodiazepines alone and in combination with antipsychotic medications for treating <b>acute</b> psychosis is warranted.|$|E

5|$|Emergency {{medical care}} applies to other <b>acute</b> health {{problems}} as well. Many illnesses with time-sensitive elements {{are common in}} developing countries, including severe infections, hypoxia caused by respiratory infections, dehydration caused by diarrhoea, intentional and unintentional injuries, postpartum bleeding, and <b>acute</b> myocardial infarction. These are potentially life-threatening conditions, yet effective treatment is often unavailable {{for much of the}} world's population.|$|E

5|$|Gout may be {{diagnosed}} and treated without further investigations in someone with hyperuricemia and the classic <b>acute</b> arthritis {{of the base}} of the great toe (known as podagra). Synovial fluid analysis should be done, however, if the diagnosis is in doubt. X-rays, while useful for identifying chronic gout, have little utility in <b>acute</b> attacks.|$|E

5|$|In <b>acute</b> poisoning, typical {{neurological}} {{signs are}} pain, muscle weakness, numbness and tingling, and, rarely, symptoms associated with {{inflammation of the}} brain. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are other <b>acute</b> symptoms. Lead's effects on the mouth include astringency and a metallic taste. Gastrointestinal problems, such as constipation, diarrhea, poor appetite, or weight loss, are common in <b>acute</b> poisoning. Absorption of large amounts of lead over a short time can cause shock (insufficient fluid in the circulatory system) due to loss {{of water from the}} gastrointestinal tract. Hemolysis (the rupture of red blood cells) due to <b>acute</b> poisoning can cause anemia and hemoglobin in the urine. Damage to kidneys can cause changes in urination such as decreased urine output. People who survive <b>acute</b> poisoning often go on to display symptoms of chronic poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Increasing general {{physical}} activity has been recommended, but no clear relationship to pain or disability {{has been found}} when used {{for the treatment of}} an <b>acute</b> episode of pain. For <b>acute</b> pain, low- to moderate-quality evidence supports walking. Treatment according to McKenzie method is somewhat effective for recurrent <b>acute</b> low back pain, but its benefit in the short term does not appear significant. There is tentative evidence to support the use of heat therapy for <b>acute</b> and sub-chronic low back pain but little evidence for the use of either heat or cold therapy in chronic pain. Weak evidence suggests that back belts might decrease the number of missed workdays, but there is nothing to suggest that they will help with the pain. Ultrasound and shock wave therapies do not appear effective and therefore are not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Most of the <b>acute</b> {{side effects}} {{associated}} with brachytherapy {{can be treated}} with medication or through dietary changes, and usually disappear over time (typically a matter of weeks), once the treatment is completed.

5|$|Neutrophils {{also play}} a key role in the {{development}} of most forms of <b>acute</b> lung injury. Here, activated neutrophils release the contents of their toxic granules into the lung environment. Experiments have shown that a reduction in the number of neutrophils lessens the effects of <b>acute</b> lung injury, but treatment by inhibiting neutrophils is not clinically realistic, as it would leave the host vulnerable to infection. In the liver, damage by neutrophils can contribute to dysfunction and injury in response to the release of endotoxins produced by bacteria, sepsis, trauma, alcoholic hepatitis, ischemia, and hypovolemic shock resulting from <b>acute</b> hemorrhage.|$|E

5|$|The main {{manifestations of}} carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning develop in the organ systems most dependent on oxygen use, {{the central nervous system}} and the heart. The initial symptoms of <b>acute</b> carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, nausea, malaise, and fatigue. These symptoms are often mistaken for a virus such as influenza or other illnesses such as food poisoning or gastroenteritis. Headache is the most common symptom of <b>acute</b> carbon monoxide poisoning; it is often described as dull, frontal, and continuous. Increasing exposure produces cardiac abnormalities including fast heart rate, low blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmia; central nervous system symptoms include delirium, hallucinations, dizziness, unsteady gait, confusion, seizures, central nervous system depression, unconsciousness, respiratory arrest, and death. Less common symptoms of <b>acute</b> carbon monoxide poisoning include myocardial ischemia, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, high blood sugar, lactic acidosis, muscle necrosis, <b>acute</b> kidney failure, skin lesions, and visual and auditory problems.|$|E
5|$|The most {{recognized}} {{marker of}} <b>acute</b> Chagas disease is called Romaña's sign, which includes {{swelling of the}} eyelids {{on the side of}} the face near the bite wound or where the bug feces were deposited or accidentally rubbed into the eye. Rarely, young children, or adults may die from the <b>acute</b> disease due to severe inflammation/infection of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or brain (meningoencephalitis).
