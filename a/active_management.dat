In 1999, Rod East of the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group estimated the springbok population in South Africa at more than 670,000, noting that it might be an underestimate. However, estimates for Namibia, Angola, Botswana, Transvaal, Karoo, and the Free State (which gave a total population estimate of nearly 2,000,000 – 2,500,000 animals in southern Africa), were in complete disagreement with East's estimate. Springbok are under <b>active</b> <b>management</b> in several private lands. Small populations have been introduced into private lands and provincial areas of KwaZulu-Natal.|$|E

Some aspects of <b>active</b> portfolio <b>management</b> We propose a framework for considering <b>active</b> portfolio <b>management,</b> consistent with existing literature in the single period environment, but extended to the multi-period environment that most practicing active managers operate in. We derive several <b>active</b> portfolio <b>management</b> results including the Generalised Law of <b>Active</b> Portfolio <b>Management</b> (a generalisation that accounts for correlations and varying information coefficients and volatilities), and the Theory of <b>Active</b> Portfolio <b>Management</b> that suggests that mean/second-moment optimisation is the best <b>active</b> portfolio <b>management</b> approach in a multi-period setting, not mean/variance. In developing these results we uncover some inappropriate practices, and several simplistic practices that are theoretically supported by our framework. 1 Some aspects of <b>active</b> portfolio <b>management</b> 1...|$|R

5|$|Weaver and {{his wife}} moved their {{household}} in 1890 from Bloomfield to Colfax, near Des Moines, as the former Congressman took up more <b>active</b> <b>management</b> of the Iowa Tribune. The Greenback and Union Labor parties were defunct, but he still proselytized for their ideals. In August 1890, Weaver addressed a convention in Des Moines where former Greenbackers and Laborites gathered, although he declined their nomination for Congress. The economic conditions that had created the Greenback party had not gone away; many farmers and laborers believed their situation had gotten worse since the Long Depression began in 1873. Many farmers had joined the Farmers' Alliance, which sought to promote soft-money ideas on a non-partisan basis; rather than create a third party, they endorsed major party candidates who supported their ideas and hired speakers to educate the public. Alliance-backed candidates did well in the 1890 elections, especially in the South, where Democrats endorsed by the Alliance won 44 seats.|$|E
5|$|With {{a series}} of {{farewell}} performances, Garrick left the stage in 1776 and sold his shares in the theatre to the Irish playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Sheridan and his partners, Thomas Linley the elder and Doctor James Ford (court physician to King George III), completed their purchase of Drury Lane two years later, and Sheridan owned it until 1809. Sheridan premiered his own comedy of manners The School for Scandal in 1777. <b>Active</b> <b>management</b> of the theatre {{was carried out by}} a number of parties during Sheridan's ownership, including himself, his father Thomas, and, from 1788 to 1796 and 1800 to 1802, the popular actor John Philip Kemble.

25|$|<b>Active</b> <b>management</b> of {{the third}} stage is a method of {{shortening}} the stage between when the baby is born and when the placenta is delivered.

Objectives of this work are to characterize and analyze <b>Active</b> System <b>Management</b> architecture and types of rules, used in the workload management of Teradata data warehouses. These objectives have been achieved by a search of available resources and their subsequent analysis. Informations obtained from the analysis were empirically verified on a particular instance of a data warehouse and their synthesis is presented in this work The contributions of this work are in the documentation of technology that is currently not well known and widespread in the Czech Republic.

The repeatable implementation procedure based on induction has been proposed in the work. Maturity of the architecture for a production environment is evaluated.

25|$|Placental {{expulsion}} can {{be managed}} actively or it {{can be managed}} expectantly, allowing the placenta to be expelled without medical assistance. <b>Active</b> <b>management</b> is described as the administration of a uterotonic drug within one minute of fetal delivery, controlled traction of the umbilical cord and fundal massage after delivery of the placenta, followed by performance of uterine massage every 15 minutes for two hours. In a joint statement, World Health Organization, the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics and the International Confederation of Midwives recommend <b>active</b> <b>management</b> of the third stage of labour in all vaginal deliveries to help to prevent postpartum hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|A Cochrane review {{suggests}} that <b>active</b> <b>management</b> (use of uterotonic drugs, cord clamping and controlled cord traction) {{during the third}} stage of labour reduces severe bleeding and anemia. However, the review also found that <b>active</b> <b>management</b> increased the mother's blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, and pain. In the <b>active</b> <b>management</b> group more women returned to hospital with bleeding after discharge, {{and there was also}} a reduction in birthweight due to infants having a lower blood volume. The effects on the baby of early cord clamping was discussed in another review which found that delayed cord clamping improved iron stores longer term in the infants. Although {{they were more likely to}} need phototherapy (light therapy) to treat jaundice, the improved iron stores are expected to be worth increasing the practice of delayed cord clamping in healthy term babies. For preterm babies (babies born before 37 weeks) a review of the research found that delaying cord clamping by 30–45 seconds increased the amount of blood flow to the baby. This is important as increased blood volume in the baby made them less likely to develop some serious complications. Much of the research around this subject is poor quality so further, larger research projects are likely to produce more reliable results.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Recent work on {{congestion}} control in TCP/IP networks combines improved end-user transmission mechanisms with <b>active</b> queue <b>management</b> schemes. In this {{paper we propose}} MARS, an adaptive early packet marking <b>active</b> queue <b>management</b> mechanism. Unlike previous proposals, MARS adapts the marking probability to drive the average queue length towards a target size. By doing so, MARS implicitly reacts {{to changes in the}} network dynamics without requiring per-flow state or estimates thereof. Our simulations confirm MARS’s flexibility and effectiveness in reducing packet loss, controlling queuing delay, and improving utilization and flow goodput.
