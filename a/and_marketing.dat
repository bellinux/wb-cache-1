40|$|Abstract Background The {{rapid growth}} of mobile phones in Ghana has opened up the {{possibility}} of delivering timely and useful weather <b>and</b> <b>market</b> information to farmers at costs lower than traditional agricultural extension services. In this paper, we assess the usefulness, constraints, and factors likely to influence farmers’ decisions to patronize mobile phone-based weather <b>and</b> <b>market</b> information. Methods We rely on primary data from 310 farmers in the Upper West Region, an understudied part of Ghana. We subject the data to three types of analysis. First, we model farmers’ decision to patronize mobile phone-based weather <b>and</b> <b>market</b> information by estimating a binary logit model. Second, we use descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing to analyse the level of usefulness of mobile phone-based weather <b>and</b> <b>market</b> information. We disaggregate the analysis by sex, income status, and age group. Finally, we use qualitative analysis to summarize the constraints associated with the utilization of mobile phone-based weather <b>and</b> <b>market</b> information. Results We find that contact with agricultural extension agents and farmer-to-farmer extension services significantly influences farmers’ decision to patronize mobile phone-based weather <b>and</b> <b>market</b> information. Regardless of sex, income status, and age group, farmers generally rate mobile phone-based weather <b>and</b> <b>market</b> information as very useful. We identify inexact information, complex text messages, information that are too costly to implement, and poor infrastructure as the constraints to the utilization of mobile phone-based weather <b>and</b> <b>market</b> information. Conclusion In order to improve the utilization of mobile phone-based weather <b>and</b> <b>market</b> information, disseminators of mobile phone-based information such as Esoko should constantly update and provide client-specific information. Improvements in mobile phone networks and related services will enhance the utilization of mobile phone-based weather <b>and</b> <b>market</b> information...|$|R
