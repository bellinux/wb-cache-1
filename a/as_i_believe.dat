25|$|Foch {{was pleased}} at Wilson’s appointment, {{although}} Haig {{noted in his}} diary (25 February) that Wilson was no longer so keen on a strong staff under Rawlinson, his successor at Versailles. Rawlinson for his part supported Haig’s unwillingness to release any divisions to the General Reserve. Petain only agreed to release 8 French divisions and made a bilateral agreement with Haig to assist one another. Wilson protested to Lloyd George, who commented that Haig’s attitude was “very stupid & short sighted but agreed we could not force Haig at this moment“. Wilson defended Haig’s position to the War Cabinet (6 March) and blamed Clemenceau and Petain (both of whom disliked Foch) and wrote in his diary that the British government {{had little choice but}} to back Haig “wrong <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> him to be”. At a SWC Meeting in London (14–15 March) Foch agreed under protest to shelve the Allied Reserve.|$|E

500|$|Up to this time, receptions of Mahler's new symphonies had {{usually been}} disappointing. However, the Munich {{premiere of the}} Eighth Symphony was an {{unqualified}} triumph; as the final chords died away {{there was a short}} pause before a huge outbreak of applause which lasted for twenty minutes. Back at his hotel Mahler received a letter from Thomas Mann, which referred to the composer as [...] "the man who, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> expresses the art of our time in its profoundest and most sacred form".|$|E
500|$|A little {{matter that}} seems to have been {{overlooked}} by all of you is the opportunity to beautify the design of the nickel or five cent piece during your administration, {{and it seems to me}} that it would be a permanent souvenir of a most attractive sort. [...] As possibly you are aware, it is the only coin the design of which you can change during your administration, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> there is a law to the effect that the designs must not be changed oftener than every twenty-five years.

500|$|The siege {{settled down}} into a routine of {{bombardment}} and counter-bombardment. This proved increasingly trying for the defenders, who were running short of manpower, ammunition and supplies. Captain Joseph Bennett, an engineer whom Leake had brought with him, helped to bolster the fortifications but earned the wrath of some in the garrison, who felt that Gibraltar should be abandoned. He wrote to a friend on 6 December {{to tell him that}} [...] "many officers had a design to quit the place and blow up the works but I always opposed them, and mentioned the garrison could be kept with the number of 900 men we had, and no more, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> you will have an [...] of.

500|$|In 1857, Marley {{published}} {{a paper in}} the Transactions of the Institution of Mining Engineers on the Cleveland Ironstone, which begins: [...] "To {{the members of this}} Institute, this ironstone cannot but be an interesting subject, whether they be mining engineers, coal owners, iron masters, or simply a part of the public personally disinterested, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that nothing has been discovered, within the last twenty years, having so direct an influence on the landed, railway, and mineral wealth, in the North of England, on the South Durham coal field, and on the iron trade generally, as the discovery and application of this large ironstone district." [...] Marley continued: [...] "I suppose it may now be taken as an admitted fact, that the prosperity or depression of the iron and coal trades regulates, in a very material degree, the prosperity or depression of nearly all other commercial pursuits in the same locality." ...|$|E
500|$|The reader's {{experience}} of Lucy is {{filtered through the}} narrator's perception. Her death suggests that nature can bring pain to all, even to those who loved her. According to the British classical and literary scholar H. W. Garrod (1878–1960), [...] "The truth is, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> that between Lucy's perfection in Nature and her death there is, for Wordsworth, really no tragic antithesis at all." [...] Hartman expands on this view to extend the view of death and nature to art in general: [...] "Lucy, living, is clearly a guardian spirit, not of one place but of all English places... while Lucy, dead, has all nature for her monument. The series is a deeply humanized version {{of the death of}} Pan, a lament on the decay of English natural feeling. Wordsworth fears that the very spirit presiding over his poetry is ephemeral, and I think he refuses to distinguish between its death in him and its historical decline." ...|$|E
500|$|Additionally, past macroevolution can be {{inferred}} from historical traces. Transitional fossils, for example, provide plausible links between several different groups of organisms, such as Archaeopteryx linking birds and dinosaurs, or the Tiktaalik linking fish and limbed amphibians. Creationists dispute such examples, from asserting that such fossils are hoaxes or that they belong exclusively to one group or the other, to asserting {{that there should be}} far more evidence of obvious transitional species. Darwin himself found the paucity of transitional species {{to be one of the}} greatest weaknesses of his theory: Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory. The explanation lies, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> in the extreme imperfection of the geological record. Darwin appealed to the limited collections then available, the extreme lengths of time involved, and different rates of change with some living species differing very little from fossils of the Silurian period. In later editions he added [...] "that the periods during which species have been undergoing modification, though very long as measured by years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which these same species remained without undergoing any change." [...] The number of clear transitional fossils has increased enormously since Darwin's day, and this problem has been largely resolved with the advent of the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which predicts a primarily stable fossil record broken up by occasional major speciations.|$|E

60|$|If {{these ideas}} be destined, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> they are, {{to be more}} and more firmly {{established}} as the world grows older; if that spirit be fated, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> it is, to extend itself into all departments of human thought, and to become co-extensive with the range of knowledge; if, as our race approaches its maturity, it discovers, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> it will, that there is but one kind of knowledge and but one method of acquiring it; then we, who are still children, may justly feel it our highest duty to recognise the advisableness of improving natural knowledge, and so to aid ourselves and our successors in our course towards the noble goal which lies before mankind.|$|E
