Methods: The stress-preventing effects of four <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents</b> (2 -phenoxyethanol, 600 mg/L; metomidate, 5 mg/L; clove oil, 30 mg/L and MS- 222, 75 mg/L) were evaluated in juvenile specimens of Senegalase sole (Solea senegalensis) subjected to two different types of acute (handling-related) stress: air exposure and net handling (chasing). To assess the stress-preventing effects of the four <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents,</b> diverse blood and plasma parameters (haematocrit, haemoglobin, glucose, lactate and cortisol levels) were determined as stress indicators. Fish were treated with the <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents</b> before being subjected to the different types of acute stress, and they were sacrificed 30 min, 2 and 24 h later. Control fish were processed in the same way without pretreatment with the <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents.</b> Results: The net handling stress was of sufficient intensity to cause {{a significant increase in the}} levels of most of the stress indicators considered. By contrast, air exposure stress only induced significant increases in cortisol and haemoglobin levels. Conclusions: The stress-preventing effects of the <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents</b> tested were ranked on the basis of their capacity to prevent increases in the haematocrit, haemoglobin, glucose, lactate and cortisol levels, as follows: metomidate (5 mg/L) > clove oil (30 mg/L) > MS- 222 (75 mg/L) > 2 -phenoxyethanol (600 mg/L) ...|$|R
40|$|The glutamate-NO-cyclic GMP pathway has {{previously}} {{been identified as a}} potential major target for general <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents.</b> An animal model of type I NOS gene disrupted mice was employed to investigate in vivo effects of the general <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents</b> isoflurane, ketamine, pentobarbital, and propofol on cyclic GMP in {{the presence or absence of}} the isoform specific NOS inhibitor, 7 -nitroindazole. G protein function was studied ex vivo in whole brains. Primary neuronal cell cultures were employed to investigate the effects of <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents</b> on glutamate stimulated cyclic GMP production. The influence of <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents</b> on the metabolism of cyclic GMP via phosphodiesterases was studied in vitro. The effects of <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents</b> on the regulation of cyclic GMP in humans are unknown. Cyclic GMP was measured in human oral mucosal transudate in volunteers and patients undergoing short general anaesthesia. A prospective double-blind placebo controlled crossover trial was conducted assessing the effects of selective PDE 5 inhibition on propofol sedation requirements in healthy volunteers. Both studies indicate a potential role of cyclic GMP mediating consciousness in humans. The work presented in this thesis indicates substantial effects of <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents</b> on the regulation of cyclic GMP in in vivo, ex vivo, in vitro and human studies and provides new insights into the mechanisms involved in modulating general anaesthesia. However, a great deal of further work remains before the complex processes underlying general anaesthesia are fully elucidated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Volatile <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents</b> {{are known}} to {{influence}} neutrophil function. The aim {{was to determine the}} effect of chronic occupational exposure to volatile <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents</b> on the rate of neutrophil apoptosis among anaesthetists. To test this hypothesis, we compared the rate of neutrophil apoptosis in anaesthetists who had been chronically exposed to volatile <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents</b> with that in unexposed volunteers. METHODS: Venous blood (20 mL) was withdrawn from 24 ASA I-II volunteers, from which neutrophils were isolated, and maintained in culture. At 1, 12 and 24 h in culture, the percentage of neutrophil apoptosis was assessed by dual staining with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide. RESULTS: At 1 h (but not at 12 and 24 h) in culture, the rate of neutrophil apoptosis was significantly less in the anaesthetists [...] 13. 8 (12. 9 %) versus 34. 4 (12. 1 %) (P = 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic occupational exposure to volatile <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents</b> may inhibit neutrophil apoptosis.

50|$|No <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agent</b> {{currently}} in use meets all these requirements, nor can any <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agent</b> be considered safe. There are inherent risks and drug interactions that {{are specific to}} each and every patient. The agents in widespread current use are isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, and nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is a common adjuvant gas, {{making it one of the}} most long-lived drugs still in current use. Because of its low potency, it cannot produce anesthesia on its own but is frequently combined with other agents. Halothane, an agent introduced in the 1950s, has been almost completely replaced in modern anesthesia practice by newer agents because of its shortcomings. Partly because of its side effects, enflurane never gained widespread popularity.|$|E

40|$|The {{activity}} of 8 -aminolaevulinic acid synthase (E. C. 2, 3. 1. 37) (the rate-limiting enzyme for haem and porphynn biosynthesis) has been {{measured in the}} rat liver after the repeated administration of <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents</b> in vivo. The {{activity of}} the enzyme was increased by Althesin, chlordiazepoxide, enfiuranej etomidate, lignocaine, methohexitone, methoxyflurane, pentazocine and thiopentone and decreased by procaine. No significant changes in activity occurred after the administration of amethocaine, atropine, bupivacaine, diazepam, droperidol, halothane, ketamine, morphine, nitrous oxide, pethidine, phenoperidine, prilocaine and propanidid. It is suggested that those <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents</b> which induced activity of the enzyme should not be administered to patients with an acute porphyria.

40|$|While history records many {{instances}} in which various substances such as wine, hemp and opium were used to deaden sensibility to the pain of surgery, {{it was not until}} William Morton's public demonstration of the painless extraction of a tooth in 1846 using ether that the modern era of anaesthesia can be said to have begun. Within a few years of this demonstration chloroform, diethyl ether and nitrous oxide had all attained a widespread, and ardent, clinical following. While these initial agents were variously highly toxic (chloroform), combustible (diethyl ether, chloroform) or of insufficient potency (nitrous oxide), {{by the end of the}} 20 th century a range of intravenous and volatile general <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents</b> (GAs) had been developed that had overcome all of these limitations. Anaesthesia is now among the safest of all routine clinical procedures, with the mortality attributable to anaes-thesia having fallen from 1 per 10, 000 healthy patients in 1950 (when mortality rates began to be systematically assayed) to less than 1 per 250, 000 (Kohn et al, 2000). However, the dramatic advances in the clinical certitude and confidence with which <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents</b> are administered have not been parallelled by a similar increase in our knowledge of the neural mechanisms responsible for their ability to remove consciousness.

50|$|For example, the GABAA {{receptor}} has two active {{sites that}} the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binds, {{but also has}} benzodiazepine and general <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agent</b> regulatory binding sites.

Diazepam is an agonist at the benzodiazepine regulatory site, and its antidote flumazenil is an antagonist.|$|E
40|$|The {{intensive}} care unit (ICU) environment is often perceived to be hostile and frightening by patients due to unfamiliar surroundings coupled with presence of numerous personnel, monitors and other equipments {{as well as a}} loss of perception of time. Mechanical ventilation and multiple painful procedures that often need to be carried out in these critically ill patients add to their overall anxiety. Sedation is therefore required not only to allay the stress and anxiety, but also to allow for mechanical ventilation and other invasive therapeutic and diagnostic procedures to be performed. The conventional intravenous sedative agents used in ICUs suffer from problems of over sedation, tachyphylaxis, drug accumulation, organ specific elimination and often lead to patient agitation on withdrawal. All this tend to prolong the ventilatory as well as ICU and hospital discharge time, which increase the risk for infection and add to the overall increase in morbidity, mortality and hospital costs. In 2005, the anaesthetic conserving device (AnaConDa®) was marketed for ICU sedation with volatile <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents.</b> A number of trials have shown the effectiveness of using volatile <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents</b> for ICU sedation with the AnaConDa device.

40|$|Most {{studies on}} the {{psychological}} effects of exposure to <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>agents</b> have been con-ducted in the laboratory with student volunteers and, in {{a comprehensive review of}} that work, Smith and Shirley [1] concluded that the evidence for impairment was not convincing at the levels of pollution normally encountered in operating theat-res.
