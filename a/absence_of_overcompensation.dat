The final version is available from Elsevier via [URL] computer simulations {{are an important part}} of the theoretical biologist's toolkit (Peck, 2004; DeAngelis & Mooij, 2005; Kokko, 2007), offering insights into a range of fundamental evolutionary processes, not least sexual selection (e. g. van Doorn & Weissing 2004, 2006; Fawcett et al., 2007, 2011; van Doorn et al., 2009; reviewed in Kuijper et al., 2012). Like all theoretical tools, they must be used with care (Hamblin, 2012). Smaldino & Newson (2013, henceforth S&N) have challenged our recent work on parent–offspring conflict over mate choice (Van den Berg et al., 2013), arguing that our simulations rely on unrealistic assumptions and that our conclusions are not supported. But all four points of criticism they present are misguided. (1) The accusation that the handicap principle cannot work in our model is wrong; Fig. 1 a in Van den Berg et al. (2013) clearly demonstrates that a costly preference for a signal of male quality does evolve. (2) The assertion that mutation bias drove male quality close to zero in our model is wrong; in fact, male quality reached very high, stable levels in our simulations. (3) The assertion that overcompensation was responsible for our results is wrong; parent and offspring preferences also diverge in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation.</b> (4) The alternative explanation offered for our results is wrong, because it predicts the opposite pattern to that we actually observed in our simulations. Below we address each of these misunderstandings and consider two alternative hypotheses suggested by S&...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the incremental effect <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> {{as compared to}} simple compensation on post-complaint satisfaction. In overcompensation, consumers {{are entitled to a}} refund that is more than the purchase price, whereas in simple compensation, the refund given is equivalent to if not less than the purchase price. A meta-analysis of 17 experimental studies shows that overcompensation has a substantially lower incremental effect on post-complaint satisfaction than simple compensation. However, when distinguishing between transaction-specific satisfaction and cumulative satisfaction, the smaller effect size <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> mainly holds true for transaction-specific satisfaction. For cumulative satisfaction, the effect size <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> is only marginally smaller. While counter-intuitive, these results appear to have a basis in three established theoretical frameworks, namely the Weber-Fechner law, prospect theory, and the different phenomenologies of the two satisfaction constructs. Implications are discussed for marketing research as well as for complaint management. Areas for future research are also explored...|$|R

40|$|Some {{efforts to}} reduce {{invasive}} populations have paradoxically led to population increases. This phenomenon, referred to as overcompensation, occurs when reduced intraspecific pressures increase juvenile survival or maturation rates, leading to increased population size. Overcompensation in response to eradication efforts could derail management efforts, {{so it would be}} beneficial to evaluate the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> prior to removal. We conducted a series of experiments to examine the potential for <b>overcompensation</b> <b>of</b> a non-native population of the European green crab, Carcinus maenas, which was being removed in Bodega Harbor, California. First, we examined the impact of adults on juvenile survival by measuring adult cannibalism on juveniles in the presence and <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> alternative prey, and the survival of tethered juveniles at varying adult densities. Second, we examined how adult presence affected juvenile short-term foraging and growth rates. Although adult presence reduced juvenile short-term foraging, we detected only minimal cannibalism and found no evidence that adults greatly reduce juvenile growth or survivorship. These results suggest that overcompensation is not likely to occur in this population in response to removal. We assessed this prediction using pre- and post-removal surveys of juvenile recruitment in Bodega Harbor compared to nearby populations, testing for evidence <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation.</b> Relative juvenile abundance did not statistically increase in removal compared to reference populations, consistent with our conclusion from the experiments. This experimental approach which focuses on an organism’s population biology provides a tool to assess capacity for assessing the capacity for overcompensation in management strategies for invasive species...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{examines}} the effectiveness <b>of</b> financial <b>overcompensation</b> {{as a means}} to enhance customer loyalty after a product failure. Overcompensation implies that customers are entitled to a refund that is larger than the purchase price. It is, however, still unclear whether large overcompensations entail saturation effects, or alternatively, result in an actual drop in customer loyalty. We predicted that the overcompensation-loyalty relationship is generally characterized by an inverted U-shaped function. In line with this prediction, the results of four studies showed that mild overcompensations had, on average, a positive effect on customer loyalty beyond equal compensation, but only up to compensation levels of approximately 150 % of the purchase price of faulty products. Beyond this level, the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> diminished, eventually leading to a general drop in customer loyalty. Despite this overall pattern, two studies revealed robust individual differences in how customers react to increasing <b>overcompensation.</b> A majority <b>of</b> customers increased their loyalty when the overcompensation enlarged, but the curve flattened out in the high range. However, there was also a smaller portion of customers who reacted negatively to every form <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation.</b> A practical implication of these findings, therefore, is that companies should not offer compensations that are greater than 150 % of the initial price, as these do not contribute to greater loyalty in any category of customers...|$|R

However, it may well be the case that a considerable fraction of employees is actually better off, if they are re-employed shortly after their dismissal. This is the first attempt to estimate the relevance <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> by severance payments. It is found that about 7 % of dismissed employees or about one quarter of those with severance payments are overcompensated in Germany. In particular, employees with many years of tenure have chances to receive severance payments as well as wage increases in their new jobs subsequent to dismissal. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} area of business ethics {{research focuses on}} how otherwise normal and law-abiding individuals can engage in acts of corruption. Key in this literature {{is the concept of}} rationalization. This is where individuals attempt to justify past and future corrupt deeds to themselves and others. In this article, we argue that rationalization often entails a process <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> whereby the justification forwarded is excessive in relation to the actual act. Such over-rationalization provides an impetus for further and more serious acts of illegality. Using a number of high profile cases, it is argued that this dynamic gap between the act and excessive rationalization can explain why corruption often escalates in severity and scope in the organization...|$|R

40|$|Overdominance {{is often}} invoked {{to account for}} the {{extensive}} polymorphisms found in natural populations <b>of</b> organisms; <b>overcompensation,</b> however, may be equally or more important. Overcompensation occurs when limiting resources are better exploited by a genetically mixed than by a uniform population, and is often causally related to frequency-dependent selection. We have designed experiments to test whether overcompensation occurs in Drosophila melanogaster, using the Sod locus as a marker. Tests are made at each of two densities and two temperatures for cultures with desired genetic compositions. Both temperature and density have statistically significant effects on the per-female productivity of the cultures. More important, there are strong effects due to overcompensation. Cultures that are more polymorphic are also more productive than less polymorphic ones even when the level of individual heterozygosity is the same in all. There is also overdominance for the Sod locus: the heterozygotes are more productive than either homozygote at every temperature and density, and the differences are statistically significant in several cases. These results corroborate previous studies showing that overdominance may contribute to the maintenance of the Sod polymorphisms. Moreover, our results indicate that the significnace <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> as a mechanism to account for polymorphism in natural populations deserves further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{homeostasis}} theory (RHT) {{suggests that}} changes {{made to the}} intrinsic risk of environments are negated {{in one of three}} ways: behavioural adjustments within the environment, mode migration, and avoidance of the physical risk. To date, this three-way model of RHT has little empirical support, whilst research findings on RHT have at times been diametrically opposed. A reconciliation of apparently opposing findings might be possible by suggesting that extrinsic compensation fails to restore previously existing levels of actual risk in cases where behavioural adjustments within the environment are incapable of negating intrinsic risk changes. This paper reports a study in which behavioural adjustments within the physical risk-taking environment are capable of reconciling target with actual risk. The results provide positive support for RHT in the form <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> for the intrinsic risk change on specific driver behaviours. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Mean-field {{theory is}} used to model {{polyelectrolyte}} adsorption and the possibility <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> <b>of</b> charged surfaces. For charged surfaces that are also chemically attractive, the overcharging is large in high salt conditions, amounting to 20 - 40 % of the bare surface charge. However, full charge inversion is not obtained in thermodynamical equilibrium for physical values of the parameters. The overcharging increases with addition of salt, but {{does not have a}} simple scaling form with the bare surface charge. Our results indicate that more evolved explanation is needed in order to understand polyelectrolyte multilayer built-up. For strong polymer-repulsive surfaces, we derive simple scaling laws for the polyelectrolyte adsorption and overcharging. We show that the overcharging scales linearly with the bare surface charge, but its magnitude is very small in comparison to the surface charge. In contrast with the attractive surface, here the overcharging is found to decrease substantially with addition of salt. In the intermediate range of weak repulsive surfaces, the behavior with addition of salt crosses over from increasing overcharging (at low ionic strength) to decreasing one (at high ionic strength). Our results for all types of surfaces are supported by full numerical solutions of the mean-field equations. Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures, final version. to be published in PR...|$|R

40|$|The Cueva del Azufre in Tabasco, Mexico, is a nutrient-rich {{cave and}} its {{inhabitants}} need to cope {{with high levels of}} dissolved hydrogen sulfide and extreme hypoxia. One of the successful colonizers of this cave is the poeciliid fish Poecilia mexicana, which has received considerable attention as a model organism to examine evolutionary adaptations to extreme environmental conditions. Nonetheless, basic ecological data on the endemic cave molly population are still missing; here we aim to provide data on population densities, size class compositions and use of different microhabitats. We found high overall densities in the cave and highest densities at the middle part of the cave with more than 200 individuals per square meter. These sites have lower H 2 S concentrations compared to the inner parts where most large sulfide sources are located, but they are annually exposed to a religious harvesting ceremony of local Zoque people called La Pesca. We found a marked shift in size/age compositions towards an overabundance of smaller, juvenile fish at those sites. We discuss these findings in relation to several environmental gradients within the cave (i. e., differences in toxicity and lighting conditions), but we also tentatively argue that the annual fish harvest during a religious ceremony (La Pesca) locally diminishes competition (and possibly, cannibalism by large adults), which is followed by a phase <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> <b>of</b> fish densities...|$|R

50|$|Alterations in {{resource}} allocation due to herbivory is studied heavily in agricultural systems (Trumble et al. 1993). Domestication of plants by selecting for higher yield have undoubtedly also caused changes in various plant growth traits, such as decreased {{resource allocation}} to non-yield tissues (Welter and Steggall 1993). Alterations in growth traits {{is likely to}} effect plant tolerance since the mechanisms overlap. That domesticated tomato plants have lower tolerance to folivory than their wild progenitors suggests this as well (Welter and Steggall 1993). Most agricultural studies however, are more focused on comparing tolerance between damaged and undamaged crops, not between crops and their wild counterparts. Many have found crops, such as cucumbers, cabbages and cauliflowers, can fully compensate and overcompensate for the damaged received (Trumble et al. 1993). A recent study by Poveda et al. (2010) also found evidence <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> in potato plants in response to tuber damage by the potato tuber moth, Phthorimaea operculella. Unlike previous examples, the potato plant does not reallocate resources, but actually increases overall productivity to increase mass of tubers and aboveground tissues (Poveda et al. 2010).|$|R
