5|$|Food {{production}} at Gedi likely involved a mixed economy based on livestock, {{as well as}} agricultural and horticultural production. Some foods were introduced through trade. Available crops included millet, <b>African</b> <b>rice,</b> cocoyam, coconuts, bananas, citrus fruits, pomegranates, figs, sugar cane, cotton, and various vegetables, while the principal livestock was likely cattle.

The Jola, who constitute 80 to 90% of the population of Basse Casamance, practice a unique form of rice cultivation. Descriptions of the techniques used in the late 15th century, recorded by the first Portuguese explorers, show them to be similar to those still in use, particularly with respect to flooding and transplanting. Only the varieties of rice have changed, from <b>African</b> <b>rice</b> to Asian rice, a separate species.|$|E

25|$|In the steppes and savannahs of the Sahara and Sahel in Northern West Africa, the Nilo-Saharan {{speakers}} and Mandé peoples started {{to collect and}} domesticate wild millet, <b>African</b> <b>rice</b> and sorghum between 8000 and 6000 BC. Later, gourds, watermelons, castor beans, and cotton were also collected and domesticated. The people started capturing wild cattle and holding them in circular thorn hedges, resulting in domestication. They also started making pottery and built stone settlements (see Tichitt and Oualata). Fishing, using bone-tipped harpoons, became a major activity in the numerous streams and lakes formed from the increased rains.|$|E
25|$|Spanish colonizers {{introduced}} Asian rice to Mexico in the 1520s at Veracruz; and the Portuguese {{and their}} African slaves introduced it {{at about the}} same time to colonial Brazil.

Planters used slave labor to support cultivation and processing of rice and indigo as commodity crops.

50|$|Oryza barthii, {{also called}} Barth's rice, wild <b>rice,</b> or <b>African</b> wild <b>rice,</b> is a {{grass in the}} rice genus Oryza. It is an annual, erect to semierect grass.

40|$|Here {{we present}} the genomic {{sequence}} of the <b>African</b> cultivated <b>rice,</b> Oryza glaberrima, and compare these data with the genome sequence of Asian cultivated rice, Oryza sativa. We obtained gene-enriched sequences of O. glaberrima that correspond to about 25 % of the gene regions of the O. sativa (japonica) genome by methylation filtration and subtractive hybridization of repetitive sequences. While patterns of amino acid changes did not differ between the two species {{in terms of the}} biochemical properties, genes of O. glaberrima generally showed a larger synonymous–nonsynonymous substitution ratio, suggesting thatO. glaberrima has undergone a genome-wide relaxation of purifying selection. We further investigated nucleotide substitutions around splice sites and found that eight genes of O. sativa experienced changes at splice sites after the divergence from O. glaberrima. These changes produced novel introns that partially truncated functional domains, suggesting that these newly emerged introns affect gene function. We also identified 2451 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) from the genomes of O. glaberrima and O. sativa. Although tri-nucleotide repeats were most common among the SSRs and were overrepresented in the protein-coding sequences, we found that selection against indels of tri-nucleotide repeats was relatively weak in both <b>African</b> and Asian <b>rice.</b> Our genome-wide sequencing ofO. glaberrima and in-depth analyses provide rice researchers not only with usefu...|$|R
