25|$|Laplace in 1816 was {{the first}} {{to point out that the}} speed of sound in air depends on the heat {{capacity}} ratio. Newton's original theory gave too low a value, because it does not take account of the <b>adiabatic</b> <b>compression</b> of the air which results in a local rise in temperature and pressure. Laplace's investigations in practical physics were confined to those carried on by him jointly with Lavoisier in the years 1782 to 1784 on the specific heat of various bodies.|$|E
25|$|This {{gives the}} 9% difference, {{and would be}} a typical ratio for speeds of sound at room {{temperature}} in helium vs. deuterium, each with a molecular weight of 4. Sound travels faster in helium than deuterium because <b>adiabatic</b> <b>compression</b> heats helium more, since the helium molecules can store heat energy from compression only in translation, but not rotation. Thus helium molecules (monatomic molecules) travel faster in a sound wave and transmit sound faster. (Sound travels at about 70% of the mean molecular speed in gases; the figure is 75% in monatomic gases and 68% in diatomic gases).|$|E
25|$|It {{is framed}} {{in terms of}} an {{idealized}} device called a Carnot engine, imagined to define a continuous cycle of states of its working body. The cycle is imagined to run so slowly that at each point of the cycle the working body {{is in a state of}} thermodynamic equilibrium. There are four limbs in such a Carnot cycle. The engine consists of four bodies. The main one is called the working body. Two of them are called heat reservoirs, so large that their respective non-deformation variables are not changed by transfer of energy as heat through a wall permeable only to heat to the working body. The fourth body is able to exchange energy with the working body only through adiabatic work; it may be called the work reservoir. The substances and states of the two heat reservoirs should be chosen so that they are not in thermal equilibrium with one another. This means that they must be at different fixed temperatures, one, labeled here with the number 1, hotter than the other, labeled here with the number 2. This can be tested by connecting the heat reservoirs successively to an auxiliary empirical thermometric body that starts each time at a convenient fixed intermediate temperature. The thermometric body should be composed of a material that has a strictly monotonic relation between its chosen empirical thermometric variable and the amount of adiabatic isochoric work done on it. In order to settle the structure and sense of operation of the Carnot cycle, it is convenient to use such a material also for the working body; because most materials are of this kind, this is hardly a restriction of the generality of this definition. The Carnot cycle is considered to start from an initial condition of the working body that was reached by the completion of a reversible <b>adiabatic</b> <b>compression.</b> From there, the working body is initially connected by a wall permeable only to heat to the heat reservoir number 1, so that during the first limb of the cycle it expands and does work on the work reservoir. The second limb of the cycle sees the working body expand adiabatically and reversibly, with no energy exchanged as heat, but more energy being transferred as work to the work reservoir. The third limb of the cycle sees the working body connected, through a wall permeable only to heat, to the heat reservoir 2, contracting and accepting energy as work from the work reservoir. The cycle is closed by reversible <b>adiabatic</b> <b>compression</b> of the working body, with no energy transferred as heat, but energy being transferred to it as work from the work reservoir.|$|E

2500|$|Similar {{phenomena}} affect strong {{sound waves}} in gas or plasma, {{due to the}} dependence of the sound speed on temperature and pressure. Strong waves heat the medium near each pressure front, due to <b>adiabatic</b> <b>compression</b> of the air itself, so that high pressure fronts outrun the corresponding pressure troughs. [...] There is a theory that the sound pressure levels in brass instruments such as the trombone become high enough for steepening to occur, forming {{an essential part of}} the bright timbre of the instruments.

2500|$|This {{secondary}} {{assembly device}} contained the lithium deuteride fusion fuel in a stainless-steel canister. Running {{down to the}} center of the secondary was a ~1.3cm thick hollow cylindrical rod of plutonium, nested in the steel canister. This was the sparkplug, a tritium-boosted fission device, which had an aperture of about 0.5cm at its center. The sparkplug was charged with about 4 grams of tritium and, imploding together with the secondary's compression, was timed to detonate by the first generations of neutrons that arrived from the primary. Timing was defined by the geometric characteristics of the sparkplug (its uncompressed annular radius), which detonated when its criticality, or k, transcended 1. Its purpose was to compress the fusion material around it from its inside, equally applying pressure with the tamper. The compression factor of the fusion fuel and its <b>adiabatic</b> <b>compression</b> energy determined the minimal energy required for the sparkplug to counteract the compression of the fusion fuel and the tamper's momentum. The sparkplug weighed about 18kg, and its initial firing yielded [...] Then it would be completely fissioned by the fusion neutrons, contributing about [...] to the total yield. The energy required by the sparkplug to counteract the compression of the fusion fuel was lower than the primary's yield because coupling of the primary’s energy in the hohlraum is accompanied by losses due to the difference between the X-ray fireball and the hohlraum temperatures. The neutrons entered the assembly by a small hole through the ~28cm thick U blast-heat shield. It was positioned in front of the secondary assembly facing the primary. Similar to the tamper-fusion capsule assembly, the shield was shaped as a circular frustum, with its small diameter facing the primary's side, and with its large diameter locked by a type of mortise and tenon joint to the rest of the secondary assembly. The shield-tamper ensemble can be visualized as a circular bifrustum. All parts of the tamper were similarly locked together to provide structural support and rigidity to the secondary assembly. Surrounding the fusion-fuel–spark-plug assembly was the uranium tamper with a standoff air-gap about 0.9cm wide that was to increase the tamper's momentum, a levitation technique used as early as Operation Sandstone and famously quoted by Ted Taylor as hammer-on-the-nail-impact. Since there were also technical concerns that high-Z tamper material would mix rapidly with the relatively low-density fusion fuel, leading to unacceptably large radiation losses the stand-off gap also acted as a buffer to hinder to some extent the unavoidable and undesirable Taylor mixing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract.
