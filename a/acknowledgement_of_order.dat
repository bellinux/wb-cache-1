5000|$|The gallery {{had gone}} {{bankrupt}} by mid 1961; to avoid his creditors, Maciunas {{took a job}} working for the US Army as a freelance designer in Wiesbaden, West Germany. He took many of the scores collected by La Monte Young for AN ANTHOLOGY, and whilst working on the design and printing for that, also began work on his own anthology Fluxus 1. Modelled in many ways on An Anthology, both works would prove difficult to publish. AN ANTHOLOGY appeared in Spring 1963; Most of Fluxus 1 was printed by the same German printers contemporaneously, but Maciunas doesn't seem to have put any copies together until sometime in early 1964, by which time he'd left his job in Germany due to bad health and had returned to New York. His letters leave a paper trail of torturous dealings with German printers;"Fluxus 1 deadline is now closed, (all works are at the printer who is scratching {{his head to the}} bone.) It should be out in Jan...." [...] George Maciunas, Dec 2 1962 [...] "Fluxus 1 $2000 (now 400 pages thick) is 80% completed - very slow printer! but I think I will have them ready end of March..."
