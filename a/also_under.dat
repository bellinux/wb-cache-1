Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone.|$|E
5|$|Although not a {{commercial}} success, it included several short stories by authors such as Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury and Philip K. Dick. The publication {{has been described}} by critics as a successor to the tradition of Unknown, a fantasy magazine that ceased publication in 1943. It was noted for printing fantasy with a rational basis such as werewolf stories that included scientific explanations. A selection of stories from Beyond was published in paperback form in 1963, <b>also</b> <b>under</b> the title Beyond.|$|E

5|$|By 2007, the {{ketogenic}} diet {{was available}} from around 75 centres in 45 countries, and less restrictive variants, {{such as the}} modified Atkins diet, were in use, particularly among older children and adults.

5|$|By {{detecting}} {{and tracking}} visual landmarks, {{in addition to}} estimating its position relative to the aircraft, the robot can perform a visual servoing. Research in vision is also conducted on simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). A merger of information between the two methods of acquisition and laser vision is being considered. Artificial intelligence arbitrating various locations is <b>also</b> <b>under</b> consideration.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} that the {{original}} proposals were being studied, advances in supersonic flight were proceeding rapidly. The narrow delta was establishing itself as a preferred planform for supersonic flight, replacing earlier designs like the swept-wing and trapezoidal layouts seen on designs like the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and the earlier WS-110 concepts. Engines {{able to cope with}} higher temperatures and widely varying intake ramp air speeds were <b>also</b> <b>under</b> design, allowing for sustained supersonic speeds.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{experimental}} therapies for endometrial cancer under research, including immunologic, hormonal, and chemotherapeutic treatments. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), an antibody against the Her2 protein, {{has been used}} in cancers known to be positive for the Her2/neu oncogene, but research is still underway. Immunologic therapies are <b>also</b> <b>under</b> investigation, particularly in uterine papillary serous carcinoma.|$|E

5|$|With {{forest fires}} {{continuing}} to burn in neighboring Indonesia, heavy smog {{was a concern}} for the event. Unhealthy levels forced the cancellation of other events in Singapore in the week leading up to the Grand Prix. Race organisers, however, did not speculate whether the Grand Prix was <b>also</b> <b>under</b> threat of cancellation. It was later reported that the smog had lifted and that the race could go ahead without any restrictions.|$|E
5|$|According to the city's police department, {{there were}} six murders, 125 robberies, 22 rapes, and 237 assaults in 2014 (an {{increase}} from the previous year, representing a violent-crime rate of 0.6percent). There were 432 burglaries, 1,845 larcenies and 107 motor-vehicle thefts (a decrease from 2013, representing a property-crime rate of 3.8percent). Compared to other cities in New York, Utica's crime rate is generally low. The Utica Police Department patrols the city, and law enforcement is <b>also</b> <b>under</b> {{the jurisdiction of the}} Oneida County Sheriff's Office and the New York State Police. The Utica Fire Department coordinates four engines, two truck companies, and rescue, HAZMAT and medical operations with a 123-person crew.|$|E
5|$|Aoki {{ultimately}} produced Chrono Trigger, while director credits were {{attributed to}} Akihiko Matsui, Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita. Toriyama designed the game's aesthetic, including characters, monsters, vehicles, and the look of each era. Masato Kato also contributed character ideas and designs. Kato planned to feature Gaspar as a playable character and Toriyama sketched him, but he was cut early in development. The development staff studied the drawings of Toriyama to approximate his style. Sakaguchi and Horii supervised; Sakaguchi {{was responsible for the}} game's overall system and contributed several monster ideas. Other notable designers include Tetsuya Takahashi, the graphic director, and Yasuyuki Honne, Tetsuya Nomura, and Yusuke Naora, who worked as field graphic artists. Yasuhika Kamata programmed graphics, and cited Ridley Scott's visual work in the film Alien as an inspiration for the game's lighting. Kamata made the game's luminosity and color choice lay between that of Secret of Mana and the Final Fantasy series. Features originally intended to be used in Secret of Mana or Final Fantasy IV, <b>also</b> <b>under</b> development at the same time, were appropriated by the Chrono Trigger team.|$|E

5|$|Architecture, {{sculpture}} and painting developed <b>also</b> <b>under</b> Italian influence {{from the beginning}} of the 16th century. A number of professionals from Tuscany arrived and worked as royal artists in Kraków. Francesco Fiorentino worked on the tomb of Jan Olbracht already from 1502, and then together with Bartolommeo Berrecci and Benedykt from Sandomierz rebuilt the royal castle, which was accomplished between 1507 and 1536. Berrecci also built Sigismund's Chapel at Wawel Cathedral. Polish magnates, Silesian Piast princes in Brzeg, and even Kraków merchants (by the mid 16th century their class economically gained strength nationwide) built or rebuilt their residencies to make them resemble the Wawel Castle. Kraków's Sukiennice and Poznań City Hall are among numerous buildings rebuilt in the Renaissance manner, but Gothic construction continued alongside for a number of decades.|$|E
5|$|Around 1760, Jones hired Samuel Dew of Richmond County {{to serve}} as his deputy clerk. Dew apprenticed under Jones for 21 years, {{occasionally}} performing duties as acting clerk. Due to his close relationship with Lord Fairfax, {{it is likely that}} Jones was Clerk of Court of neighboring counties <b>also</b> <b>under</b> the ownership of Lord Fairfax's Northern Neck Proprietary. According to Maxwell and Swisher, Jones relied upon his deputy clerks, such as Dew, to transcribe and document court proceedings, which Jones traveled among the various counties to sign.|$|E
5|$|By 1938, with Amazings {{circulation}} down to only 15,000, Teck Publications {{was having}} financial problems. In January 1938 Ziff-Davis {{took over the}} magazine and shortly thereafter moved production to Chicago; the April issue was assembled by Sloane but published by Ziff-Davis. Bernard Davis, who ran Ziff-Davis's editorial department, attempted to hire Roger Sherman Hoar as editor; Hoar turned down the job but suggested Raymond A. Palmer, an active local science fiction fan. Palmer was hired that February, taking over editorial duties with the June 1938 issue. Ziff-Davis launched Fantastic Adventures, a fantasy companion to Amazing, in May 1939, <b>also</b> <b>under</b> Palmer's editorship. Palmer quickly managed to improve Amazing's circulation, and in November 1938, the magazine went monthly again, though this did not last throughout Palmer's tenure: between 1944 and 1946 the magazine was bimonthly and then quarterly {{for a while before}} returning to a longer-lasting monthly schedule.|$|E
