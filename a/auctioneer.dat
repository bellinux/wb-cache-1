5|$|During the 19th century, Bond Street {{became less}} {{known for its}} social {{atmosphere}} but increased its reputation as a street for luxury shopping. The <b>auctioneer</b> Phillips was established in 1796 at No.101 Bond Street, specialising in stringed instruments and sheet music. The jewellers Asprey originally opened in 1830 at Nos.165–169 New Bond Street. The Jewish practice of Kabbalah {{has been associated with}} the street after former East End trader Sarah Levenson opened a shop on No.50 New Bond Street in 1856 which immediately became profitable, albeit through exaggerated and questionable product claims. Levenson was twice taken to court and prosecuted for fraud; each prosecution resulted in a five-year prison sentence. She died midway through the second. Nevertheless, the practice regained popularity and a Kabbalah Centre remains on the street.|$|E

40|$|The sale {{of unique}} art objects at auction has changed {{dramatically}} over the past thirty years. Auction houses have grown from wholesale suppliers for art dealers to huge, multinational concerns that market art directly to the public. As the character of auction houses has changed, the traditional agency and sales rules governing auctions have become increasingly inadequate. In this article, I address the societal assumptions underlying the rules that govern <b>auctioneers,</b> then describe the current legal duties of <b>auctioneers</b> as agents and sellers in the marketplace. Based on criticisms of the current rules governing <b>auctioneers,</b> I propose a model code of conduct for <b>auctioneers</b> based on underlying assumptions {{about the role of}} <b>auctioneers</b> in the market for art...|$|R
5|$|Henri-Georges Clouzot {{was born}} in Niort, France, to mother Suzanne Clouzot and father Georges Clouzout, a book store owner. He {{was the first of}} three {{children}} in a middle-class family. Clouzot showed talent by writing plays and playing piano recitals. In 1922, Clouzot's father's bookstore went bankrupt and his family moved to Brest, France, where his father became an <b>auctioneer.</b> In Brest, Henri-Georges Clouzot went to Naval School, but was unable to become a Naval Cadet due to his myopia. At the age of 18, Clouzot left for Paris to study political science. While living in Paris, he became friends with several magazine editors. His writing talents led him to theater and cinema as a playwright, lyricist and adaptor-screenwriter. The quality of his work led producer Adolphe Osso to hire him and send him to Germany to work in Studio Babelsberg in Berlin, translating scripts for foreign language films shot there.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} episode, an amnesic Kay {{is accused of}} murdering defense {{attorney}} Tsubasa Kagome. Edgeworth is brought up before the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee, which threatens to take his badge if he becomes involved with Kay's case; Edgeworth voluntarily gives up his badge and continues to investigate with help from prosecutor Franziska von Karma. He discovers that someone has been auctioning off evidence from legal cases, and finds a recording indicating that Kagome's murderer had a burn mark on their chin. When Edgeworth is called to defend himself against the committee, Mikagami reveals Bansai Ichiyanagi, {{the head of the}} investigation committee and Yumihiko's father, as the <b>auctioneer</b> and the one responsible for legal corruption in his former position as chief prosecutor. Edgeworth tricks him into revealing his burn mark, identifying him as Kagome's murderer. Kay then remembers being attacked by someone and Shelly de Killer reveals the concept of the mastermind to Edgeworth and Kay.|$|E

25|$|Another {{approach}} to choosing an SOB: The <b>auctioneer</b> may achieve good success {{by asking the}} expected final sales price for the item, as this method suggests to the potential buyers the item's particular value. For instance, say an <b>auctioneer</b> is about to sell a $1,000 car at a sale. Instead of asking $100, hoping to entice wide interest (for who wouldn't want a $1,000 car for $100?), the <b>auctioneer</b> may suggest an opening bid of $1,000; although the first bidder may begin bidding at a mere $100, the final bid may more likely approach $1,000.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we analyse a {{multistage}} game {{of competition}} among <b>auctioneers.</b> In a first stage, <b>auctioneers</b> commit to some publicly announced reserve prices, {{and in a}} second stage, bidders choose to participate {{in one of the}} auctions. We prove existence of Nash equilibria in mixed strategies for the whole game. We also show that one property of the equilibrium set is that when the numbers of <b>auctioneers</b> and bidders tend to infinity, almost all <b>auctioneers</b> with production cost low enough to trade announce a reserve price equal to their production costs. Our paper confirms previous results for some "limit" versions of the model by McAfee [9], Peters [13], and Peters and Severinov [18]. Auctions; Perfect Competition; Large Markets. ...|$|R

25|$|Walrasi{{an auction}} or Walrasian tâtonnement is an auction {{in which the}} <b>auctioneer</b> takes bids from both buyers and sellers in a market of {{multiple}} goods. The <b>auctioneer</b> progressively either raises or drops the current proposed price depending on the bids of both buyers and sellers, the auction concluding when supply and demand exactly balance. As a high price tends to dampen demand while a low price tends to increase demand, in theory there is a particular price {{somewhere in the middle}} where supply and demand will match.|$|E
25|$|The minimum bid {{differs from}} a reserve price (see definition), {{in that the}} <b>auctioneer</b> sets the minimum bid, while the seller sets the reserve price (if desired).|$|E

25|$|English auction, {{also known}} as an open {{ascending}} price auction. This type of auction {{is arguably the most}} common form of auction in use today. Participants bid openly against one another, with each subsequent bid required to be higher than the previous bid. An <b>auctioneer</b> may announce prices, bidders may call out their bids themselves (or have a proxy call out a bid on their behalf), or bids may be submitted electronically with the highest current bid publicly displayed. In some cases a maximum bid might be left with the <b>auctioneer,</b> who may bid on behalf of the bidder according to the bidder's instructions. The auction ends when no participant is willing to bid further, at which point the highest bidder pays their bid. Alternatively, if the seller has set a minimum sale price in advance (the 'reserve' price) and the final bid does not reach that price the item remains unsold. Sometimes the <b>auctioneer</b> sets a minimum amount by which the next bid must exceed the current highest bid. The most significant distinguishing factor of this auction type is that the current highest bid is always available to potential bidders. The English auction is commonly used for selling goods, most prominently antiques and artwork, but also secondhand goods and real estate.|$|E
25|$|Auctioneers {{may or may}} not (depending on {{the laws}} of the {{jurisdiction}} and/or the policies of the auction house) bid for their own account, or if they do must disclose this to bidders at the auction; similar rules may apply for employees of the <b>auctioneer</b> or the auction house.|$|E
