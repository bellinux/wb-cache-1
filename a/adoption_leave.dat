However, unlike paid holidays or breaks that are available for [...] "workers", child care rights are restricted to [...] "employees". They are also less favourable for male parents, which affects gender equality. Going beyond the minimum in the Pregnant Workers Directive, the ERA 1996 section 71 to 73 and the Maternity and Parental Leave, etc Regulations 1999 guarantee maternity leave for 52 weeks in total, but in four steps, paid and unpaid. First, women must take two weeks compulsory leave {{at the time of}} child birth. Second, and covering the compulsory leave, there is a right to 6 weeks' leave paid at 90 per cent of ordinary earnings. Third, there is a right to 33 weeks leave at the statutory rate, or 90 per cent of ordinary earnings if this is lower, which was £138.18 per week in 2014. The government reimburses employers for the costs according to the employer's size and national insurance contributions. Fourth, the mother may take additional, but unpaid maternity leave for another 13 weeks. A contract of employment can always be, and if collectively bargained usually is, more generous. There is no qualifying period for the right to unpaid leave, but the mother must have worked for 26 weeks for the right to paid leave. The mother must also tell the employer 15 weeks before the date of the expected birth, in writing if the employer requests it. Employees may not suffer any professional detriment or dismissal while they are absent, and should be able to return to the same job after 26 weeks, or another suitable job after 52 weeks. If parents adopt, then the rights to leave follow maternity rules for one primary carer. However, for fathers ordinarily, the position is less generous. The Paternity and <b>Adoption</b> <b>Leave</b> Regulations 2002 entitle a father to 2 weeks leave, at the statutory rate of pay. Both parents may also take [...] "parental leave". This means that, until a child turns 5, or a disabled child turns 18, parents can take up to 13 weeks unpaid leave. Unless there is another collective agreement in place, employees should give 21 days' notice, no more than 4 weeks in a year, at least 1 week at a time, and the employer can postpone the leave for 6 months if business would be unduly disrupted. Otherwise, employees have a right to suffer no detriment, nor be dismissed, and have the right to their previous jobs back. To redress the imbalance between women and men bearing children, the Additional Paternity Leave Regulations 2010 made it possible for the woman to transfer up to 26 weeks of her maternity leave entitlements to her partner. However, it remains the case that women care for children more than men, which operates as a comparative obstacle to career advancement, and perpetuates the gender pay gap.|$|E

The results of this first stage show how different IM regulations are important determinants of these three macroeconomic variables that we consider afterwards having an impact on innovation adoption. Hence, in the second stage we address whether innovation adoption rates significantly depend on the degree of cooperation, trade and competition as well as some control variables such as national legal structures and IPR regulations. Estimations have been computed using an econometric model whose dependent variable is total innovation adoption as well as its possible disaggregation into sub-categories.

40|$|Canada and the United States, while {{similar in}} many ways, diverge {{substantially}} {{when it comes}} to family law. Canada’s marriage and divorce law is national, while the U. S. family law is largely governed by state law. This makes rules in the United States heterogeneous compared to those in Canada, and thus easier to tailor to the preferences of people living in the various states. A more important difference between the two treatments is that Canada supports a diversity of relationships positively (through providing for financial assistance and legal recognition) and through its public policy. The United States, while tolerating most family forms, formally recognizes only marriage and <b>adoption,</b> <b>leaving</b> adults in heterodox relationships to private support or contract. In both these North American jurisdictions, people live in a variety of family forms. While most heterosexual couples marry, some do not. This paper considers the effects of the differing policies on young people in two minority groups, the Québécois in Canada and African Americans in the United States, both of which groups de facto eschew formal marriage. Both are relatively impoverished groups, and both historically have suffered discrimination and been underrepresented among the national power elites. Yet despite these surface differences, the two groups diverge in terms of the mental health of their youth, and quite notably in terms of the rate at which they commit suicide.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 Individuals {{suffering}} from neuromuscular traumas, such as stroke and spinal cord injury, face limited options in regaining motor function after injury. Emerging methods in brain-machine interfaces aim to assist individuals by directly connecting brain signals with assistive technologies. Human BMI studies are limited, leaving {{most studies to}} rely on models. Monkey studies are typically conducted in constrained booths under controlled conditions using brain areas that modulate with motor behavior. These approaches present challenges in translating to human populations with varying motor mappings, residual movement abilities, and cortical damage. These methods require years of work before seeing widespread <b>adoption,</b> <b>leaving</b> traditional methods as the leading treatment for most patients. Here, we present four novel approaches to these problems. First, we present a rewarding brain-stimulation paradigm in unconstrained primates. To reward increases in cell activity, we sought sites in nucleus accumbens (NAc) whose stimulation reinforced operant responding. Spikes occurring above baseline rates triggered electrical pulses to the reinforcement site. In-booth conditioning produced increases in neuron firing in 48 of 58 cells. In-cage conditioning produced significant increases in 21 of 33 sessions. Second we developed a feeder and behavior monitoring system specifically designed for BMI applications. This system interfaces existing untethered recording equipment with a hub that controls a cage-mounted feeder. The behavior monitoring system uses a depth camera to provide real-time, easy to analyze, gross movement data streams. In a proof-of-concept experiment we demonstrated robust control and learning of the system over 14 sessions. Next we describe {{the development of a}} gamified therapy system, vHAB, designed to enhance traditional recovery methods. vHAB consists of engaging games based on therapy tasks, automated analytics that describe patient progress, and carefully selected commodity hardware. Developing versions of the vHAB system were used at multiple pilot sites and two studies. Finally, we relate initial promising results of the use of the prefrontal cortex as a non-motor area for BMI applications. Single neurons and local field potentials of the prefrontal cortex were conditioned in a constrained environment with three monkeys. Initial results were limited due to hardware complications, but monkeys showed signs of learning the task...|$|R

5000|$|Parental leave is an {{employee}} benefit that provides paid or unpaid time off work {{to care for}} a child. [...] This includes maternity, paternity, and <b>adoption</b> <b>leave.</b> Extending the leave for fathers as well as mothers helps close the motherhood penalty because it helps to reduce the responsibility of care work on mothers. According to Motherhood Manifesto, family leave will also help out the company by saving money on training and recruitment because this leads to higher job satisfaction and in return will lead to better work productivity. A criticism of paternal leave is that even with the options available more mothers take the leave than fathers due to social norms and economic reasoning. Men are typically paid more than women, so if the leave is unpaid then it makes economical sense to have the woman take the leave. Therefore, primary responsibility of care work still typically falls on the woman. One potential solution to this problem is to cover a greater proportion of earnings during paternity leave. Men appear to be more responsive than women to the coverage of earnings during leave and so paying them more during their leave is one way to encourage fathers to actually take advantage of paternity leave. Giving men incentives to take on more care duties at home attempts to change the norms around care work.|$|E
