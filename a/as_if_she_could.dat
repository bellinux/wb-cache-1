2500|$|During her Janet World Tour, Jackson {{experienced}} an emotional breakdown, stemming from self-hatred, childhood humiliation, self-harm, and distorted body image. She stated, [...] "I was very, very sad. Very down. I couldn't get up sometimes. There {{were times when}} I felt very hopeless and helpless, and I felt like walls were kind of closing in on me...like you can't escape". She questioned her career path, feeling pressured by {{the demands of the}} entertainment industry, saying, [...] "People look at you differently, as if you're not human." [...] Abbie Kearse of MTV responded, [...] "You're creating a person who might not really be you, but you've created this fantasy woman, so when it's time to get back to business, it's like 'I've {{got to go back to}} that world'". Jackson expressed concern for how she could portray an object of fantasy, feeling <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> no longer fulfill her own desires.|$|E
60|$|Isabel {{glanced at}} them, and glanced away, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{not bear to}} see them.|$|E
60|$|Marian looked down, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{not bear}} to meet his countenance, and faltered as she {{repeated}} them.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} me for a moment with an air of perplexity, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> really <b>could</b> not {{remember}} whom I was.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the far end}} of the Row {{she cried}} out: [...] "Let's go on to Richmond now," [...] and trotted off into the road, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> knew <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do with him what she wished. And, {{following}} meekly, he asked himself: Why? What was there in her to make up to him for all that he was losing--his power of work, his dignity, his self-respect? What was there? Just those eyes, and lips, and hair? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, be quiet, father. You're wound up, by {{the sound}} of you,' she said to him, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> crossly. But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never be cross with him.|$|R
60|$|Lucetta {{covered her}} eyes with her right hand, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> plead no more, holding out her left to Elizabeth-Jane.|$|E
60|$|Eustacia made no reply, but {{she looked}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> say as much upon that subject as he if she chose.|$|E
60|$|Kate only {{answered}} with a long breath; not feeling <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> understand such comfort, but with a resolve to try.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Cuthcott made a queer, deep little noise; {{it was not}} a laugh, however, and {{it seemed}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he knew <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not bear him to look at her just then.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no capital myself, but {{my mother}} has a little {{property}} which {{takes the form of}} an annuity"--here Mr. Guppy's mother rolled her head <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> never <b>could</b> sufficiently enjoy the observation, and put her handkerchief to her mouth, and again winked at me--"and a few pounds for expenses out of pocket in conducting business will never be wanting, free of interest, which is an advantage, you know," [...] said Mr. Guppy feelingly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh I've {{known them}} at places--at Cannes, at Pau, at Shanghai--do it sooner still. I always {{know when they}} will. You CAN'T make out they don't love me!" [...] He spoke almost plaintively, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he wished <b>she</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R
60|$|HYPATIA. [suddenly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> bear {{no more of}} it] Bentley: do go {{and play}} tennis with Johnny. You must take exercise.|$|E
60|$|She {{could say}} nothing save a hoarse 'Where?' as with both arms she pressed him <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{never let him}} go again.|$|E
6000|$|She affixed the stamps in a flash. [...] "She'll {{catch the}} train!" [...] she then {{declared}} to him breathlessly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> absolutely guarantee it.|$|E
60|$|She {{went back}} to her cabin, after a while, and she {{continued}} to have her three meals a day all the same <b>as</b> usual; but <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have seen, <b>as</b> Kate saw, how steadily the little fund for her support was diminishing day by day, she would have had some reason for her apprehensions.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish that}} were the worst of it;" [...] and as she spoke she raised her eyes toward me, and the least {{little bit of a}} smile came upon her lips, <b>as</b> <b>if,</b> though troubled, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not help feeling the comical absurdity of the situation.|$|R
60|$|When she was gone, however, he {{returned}} to the weather for conversation; but when Statira said it was lucky for her that the winter held off so, he made out to inquire about her sickness, and she told him that she had caught a heavy cold; at first it seemed just to be a head-cold, but afterwards it seemed to settle on the lungs, and it seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> never <b>could</b> throw it off; they had had the doctor twice; but now she was better, and the cough was nearly all gone.|$|R
60|$|The {{plaintiff}} {{looked a}} little perplexed, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not understand {{how it could be}} otherwise than wrong, for a girl to usurp her seat.|$|E
6000|$|She looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{hardly believe}} me. [...] "Surely {{you must have}} heard the name," [...] she said, [...] "when I told you about poor Euneece?" ...|$|E
60|$|Ethel {{could bear}} it no longer. <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> escape, she fled upstairs into her room, and, falling on her knees, hid her face on her bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Kiss her first. Me last. Just once. Now, go! I won't be weak {{with you}} like David is. And don't you be afraid for me. I can get along. I'm not a man!" [...] She {{went into the}} cabin, with her baby over her shoulder; but {{in a little while}} she came back without it, and stared after the figure of Laban losing itself in the night. Then {{she sat down on the}} {{doorstep}} and cried; it seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> never <b>could</b> stop; but the tears helped her.|$|R
60|$|She was {{altogether}} much shaken, {{she dreamed}} strange dreams by night, {{was capable of}} little by day, was declared by the children to be cross, and was much inclined to plead indisposition {{as an excuse for}} not visiting that alarming room in the evening. Indeed for the greater part of the day <b>she</b> felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> must avail herself of the pretext, and <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> neither <b>could</b> nor would encounter that strange double creature in the dark; but somehow she had been as much fascinated as terrified, and, in spite of her resolve, she found herself mechanically following Jumbo, shuddering all over and as cold as ice.|$|R
5000|$|Real name in {{the story}} is unknown, only known as {{according}} to her title as Kita no Kata. She is the step-mother of Lady Ochikubo and wife of the Chūnagon. She plays as the cruel step-mother who continuously gives trouble and humiliation to her step-daughter. She dislikes Lady Ochikubo and takes all the happiness and luxurious things away from her. Kita no Kata would not address her step-daughter as “princess” or “Lady”, and would rather address her <b>as</b> servant <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> But due to her concern that the Lord may dislike her upon for calling Lady Ochikubo as servant, she tells everyone in the mansion to title the Lady as “Ochikubo no Kimi” ...|$|R
60|$|Marguerite felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{almost hear}} them talking {{it over and}} vowing that she should not escape, and that the Scarlet Pimpernel should soon be captured.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Never mind, Charlie is not.' She sprung out, {{holding his}} hand, and felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{never forget that}} moment when her new brother first kissed her brow.|$|E
6000|$|RAINA (coming {{a little}} towards him, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not believe her senses). Do you mean {{what you said}} just now? Do {{you know what you}} said just now? ...|$|E
5000|$|At a guest {{lecture at}} Stanford University, Trask {{said that she}} embraced the label 'racist', saying [...] "In Hawaii, I am {{probably}} the most famous racist." [...] She added that she believed it impossible for a Native Hawaiian to not be considered racist in Hawaiʻi unless [...] "you dance in a hotel" [...] as well <b>as</b> saying that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have her way non-Hawaiians would have no property rights in a sovereign Hawaiʻi.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! don't {{you see the}} tone, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{were not}} fully satisfied, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> only <b>could</b> not see surface faults in me," [...] said Flora; [...] "and how she said she dreaded my love of praise, and of being liked. I wonder how {{it would have been}} <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had lived. I have looked back so often in the past year, and I think the {{hollowness}} began from that time. It might have been there before, but I am not so sure. You see, at that dreadful time, after the accident, I was the eldest who was able to be efficient, and much more useful than poor Ethel. I think the credit I gained made me think myself perfection, and I never did anything afterwards but seek my own honour." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{there was}} a lapse into depths out of which it seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> never <b>could</b> rise again; then a lift into clouds far above all grief, black clouds, that blotted out the sun, but where she soared with him, with George--George! She had the fever that she {{expected}} of herself, {{but she did not}} die in it; she was not even delirious, and it did not last long. When she was well enough to leave her bed, her one thought was of George's mother, of his strangely worded wish that she should go to her and see what <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do for her. In the exaltation of the duty laid upon her--it buoyed her up instead of burdening her--she rapidly recovered.|$|R
6000|$|A motion, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{not bear}} this, made Violet fear she must desist, and {{she paused for}} a short interval, then said, 'SHE was very fond of Theodora.' ...|$|E
60|$|Her head {{moved quickly}} {{several times in}} tiny affirmative nods, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not trust herself to speak, or even to look at him. She was biting her lower lip.|$|E
6000|$|... "What shall I do [...] . {{what shall}} I do!" [...] she exclaimed, faintly, looking around {{on every side}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not make up her mind which way to rush off.|$|E
60|$|Her eyes--with dilated pupils {{and pale}} opaque rims--had {{the look of}} the seer in them now; she gazed {{straight}} out before her into the rain-laden air, and it seemed almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> in it <b>she</b> <b>could</b> perceive visions of avenging swords, of defending angels and accusing ghouls, that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> hear whisperings of muffled voices and feel beckoning hands guiding her to a world peopled by specters and evil beings that prey upon the dead.|$|R
6000|$|She {{herself on}} these {{occasions}} of exaltation {{would be far}} too deeply moved to sing. She was inundated by a swimming sense of boundaries nearly transcended, {{as though she was}} upon the threshold of a different life altogether, the real enduring life, and <b>as</b> though <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only maintain herself long enough in this shimmering exaltation she would get right over; things would happen, things that would draw her into that music and magic and prevent her ever returning to everyday life again. There one would walk through music between great candles under eternal stars, hand-in-hand with a tall white figure. But nothing ever did happen to make her cross that boundary; the hymn ceased, the [...] "Amen" [...] died away, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a curtain fell. The congregation subsided. Reluctantly she would sink back into her seat....|$|R
60|$|Hermione {{looked at}} him along her narrow, pallid cheeks. Her eyes were strange and drugged, heavy under their heavy, {{drooping}} lids. Her thin bosom shrugged convulsively. He stared back at her, devilish and unchanging. With another strange, sick convulsion, <b>she</b> turned away, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were sick, <b>could</b> feel dissolution setting-in in her body. For with her mind {{she was unable to}} attend to his words, he caught her, as it were, beneath all her defences, and destroyed her with some insidious occult potency.|$|R
