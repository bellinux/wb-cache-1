5|$|Mars's average {{distance}} from the Sun is roughly , and its orbital period is 687 (Earth) days. The solar day (or sol) on Mars is only slightly longer than an Earth day: 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds. <b>A</b> <b>Martian</b> year is equal to 1.8809 Earth years, or 1 year, 320 days, and 18.2 hours.|$|E

5|$|Disaster {{strikes at}} the press event. The craft {{apparently}} draws power from the broadcasting equipment, and its influence is magnified. The streets of London erupt into violence as those affected go on a rampage. Breen becomes drawn towards the craft and is killed. Quatermass falls under the alien control as well, but is snapped out of it by Roney, who is unaffected. The two men realise that {{a small portion of}} the population are immune. The psychic energy becomes stronger, ripping up streets and buildings, and the spectral image of <b>a</b> <b>Martian</b> towers above the city, centred on Hobbs End. Recalling stories about how the Devil could be defeated with iron and water, Roney theorises the Martian energy could be discharged into the earth. Roney climbs to the top of a building crane and swings it into the spectre. The crane bursts into flames as it discharges the energy, killing Roney, but the image disappears.|$|E
5|$|Grappling {{with family}} challenges, Vonnegut {{continued}} to write, publishing novels vastly dissimilar {{in terms of}} plot. The Sirens of Titan (1959) features <b>a</b> <b>Martian</b> invasion of Earth, as experienced by a bored billionaire, Malachi Constant. He meets Winston Rumfoord, an aristocratic space traveler, who is virtually omniscient but stuck in a time warp {{that allows him to}} appear on Earth every 59 days. The billionaire learns that his actions and the events of all of history are determined by a race of robotic aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, who need a replacement part that can only be produced by an advanced civilization in order to repair their spaceship and return homeâ€”human history has been manipulated to produce it. Some human structures, such as the Kremlin, are coded signals from the aliens to their ship as to how long it may expect to wait for the repair to take place. Reviewers were uncertain what to think of the book, with one comparing it to Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} Peggy's {{day and a}} heated {{argument}} with her boyfriend Abe, over her preoccupation with work and the effect this has on their sex life. The argument ends with Abe's leaving in a huff. After Don pulls Megan away for an impromptu trip to a Howard Johnson's hotel in upstate New York, Peggy has to pitch to the Heinz executives without them and unsuccessfully tries to sell the Heinz executives on her concept. Frustrated, she leaves work, {{has a couple of}} drinks, and goes to see the film Born Free (1966). She sees a young man smoking marijuana behind her, partakes herself, and eventually gives him a hand job. She returns to her office to see Ginsberg arguing with his father. After being told off by Ginsberg for eavesdropping, she falls asleep in Don's office. She awakens to a call from Don, who seems alarmed for incomprehensible reasons. Don hangs up on her, and Peggy returns to her office. When Peggy asks about Ginsberg's life, Ginsberg initially claims to be <b>a</b> <b>Martian,</b> stating that Morris Ginsberg is not his father. Michael was born in a Nazi concentration camp and, after its liberation, Morris claimed him from a Swedish orphanage when Michael was 5 years old. Peggy returns home, affected by this story, and calls Abe. She tells him about Ginsberg and asks him to come over to be with her.|$|E

25|$|In March 2004 it was {{suggested}} that the unique Kaidun meteorite, which landed in Yemen on March 12, 1980, may have originated on the Martian moon of Phobos. Because Phobos has similarities to C-type asteroids and because the Kaidun meteorite is a carbonaceous chondrite, Kaidun is not <b>a</b> <b>Martian</b> meteorite in the strict sense. However, it may contain small fragments of material from the Martian surface.|$|E
25|$|A team of Russian and American {{scientists}} {{proposed that}} the radioresistance of D. radiodurans had <b>a</b> <b>Martian</b> origin. Evolution of the microorganism could have taken place on the Martian surface until it was delivered to Earth on a meteorite. However, apart from its resistance to radiation, Deinococcus is genetically and biochemically very similar to other terrestrial life forms, arguing against an extraterrestrial origin not common to them.|$|E
25|$|The minimum-energy launch {{windows for}} <b>a</b> <b>Martian</b> {{expedition}} occur at intervals of approximately {{two years and}} two months (specifically 780 days, the planet's synodic period with respect to Earth). In addition, the lowest available transfer energy varies on a roughly 16-year cycle. For example, a minimum occurred in the 1969 and 1971 launch windows, rising to a peak in the late 1970s, and hitting another low in 1986 and 1988.|$|E

Like the animals upon which the warriors were mounted, the heavier draft animals wore neither bit nor bridle, but were guided entirely by telepathic means.|$|R
25|$|In fiction, the Shepperton to Weybridge Ferry is {{the scene}} of the first {{confrontation}} between the British military, six twelve-pound artillery pieces, and the Martians, five fighting-machines, that the protagonist witnesses in H. G. Wells' famous science fiction novel The War of the Worlds. <b>A</b> <b>Martian</b> is destroyed by a direct hit from an artillery shell, and its comrades use their heat rays to wreak vengeance on the fleeing crowds waiting to cross the ferry.|$|E
25|$|Siegel has {{cited the}} John Carter of Mars stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs as an {{influence}} on the source of Superman's strength and leaping ability being the lesser gravity of a smaller planet. Jack Williamson once remarked that Superman's origin had strong similarities to a story he had written and published early in his career, where <b>a</b> <b>Martian</b> scientist sent his infant daughter into space to save her from their planet's destruction.|$|E
25|$|While the Apollo {{missions}} gathered 380 {{kilograms of}} Moon rocks, the Soviet Luna 16, Luna 20 and Luna 24 robots gathered only 326grams combined (that is, less than one-thousandth as much). Indeed, current plans for <b>a</b> <b>Martian</b> sample return would only gather about 500grams of soil, and a recently proposed South Pole-Aitken basin robot mission would only gather about 1 kilogram of Moon rock. If NASA had used similar robot technology, then between 300 and 2000 robot missions {{would have been}} needed to collect the current amount of Moon rocks that is held by NASA.|$|E
