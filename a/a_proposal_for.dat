5|$|A {{constitutional}} {{convention was}} convened in Salt Lake City on March 8, 1849, {{to work on}} <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> federal {{recognition of a state}} or territory. The convention resulted in the provisional State of Deseret. Deseret claimed most of present-day Utah, Nevada and Arizona, with parts of California, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming. Brigham Young was elected governor on March 12, 1849, and the legislature first met on July 2, 1849. The state, having never been recognized by the federal government, was formally dissolved on April 5, 1851, several months after word of the creation of Utah Territory reached Salt Lake City.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> a new {{underground}} railway {{running from}} Victoria to Walthamstow was first proposed by a Working Party {{set up by}} the British Transport Commission in 1948, though that largely followed a 1946 plan for an East Croydon to Finsbury Park line. A route was approved in 1955 with future extensions to be decided later, though funding for the construction was not approved by the government until 1962. Construction began in 1962 on the initial Walthamstow to Victoria section. The Victoria line platforms opened on 7 March 1969. The station opened as part of a second extension from Warren Street to Victoria. Cross-platform interchange between the Bakerloo and Victoria lines was provided by constructing the Victoria line platforms parallel to the Bakerloo ones.|$|E
5|$|After Adolf Hitler came {{to power}} in January 1933, Piłsudski is rumored to have {{proposed}} to France a preventive war against Germany. It has been argued that Piłsudski may have been sounding out France regarding possible joint military action against Germany. Lack of French interest may have been a reason why Poland signed the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 1934. Little evidence has, however, been found in French or Polish diplomatic archives that such <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> preventive war was ever actually advanced.|$|E
5|$|By September 1943, Neddermeyer's {{team had}} grown from five people to fifty. That month, John von Neumann came to Los Alamos at Oppenheimer's request. Von Neumann was {{impressed}} by the implosion concept and, working with Edward Teller, an old friend, made a series of suggestions. Von Neumann was able to create a sound mathematical model of implosion, enabling Neddermeyer to present <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> a greatly expanded research program. Edwin McMillan and Isidor Isaac Rabi recommended that George Kistiakowsky, who had a specialized knowledge in the precision use of explosives, be brought in to help the program. In February 1944, Kistiakowsky became Parsons' deputy for implosion.|$|E

5|$|Features at {{the park}} include a fountain, artworks, a cafe, and a {{distinctive}} glass canopy. Director Park was designed by Laurie Olin of the design firm OLIN, and the Portland-based architectural firm ZGF Architects. The park {{is part of what}} had originally been planned as a corridor of consecutive public parks stretching across downtown Portland. This plan included what are today the South Park Blocks and the North Park Blocks. Proposals to connect the two sets of park blocks arose in the 1970s, and in 1998 businessman Tom Moyer made <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> what became Director Park. Planning began in the mid-2000s, and construction began in 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 1785, <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> the {{creation}} of a General Assembly went before the Synod, yet the convening of one was delayed due to the necessity of having to write a constitution, a constitution which officers could not initially agree upon. In 1788, the Synod adopted a constitution modeled on the Church of Scotland in which power was centralized in the General Assembly. The constitution also included provisions of the Church of Scotland's Barrier Act of 1697, which required the General Assembly to receive the approval of a majority of presbyteries before making major changes to the church's constitution and doctrine.|$|E

5|$|Initially, some of {{the coal}} carried on the canal had been transported in boats owned by the canal company, but they had given up this {{practice}} in 1812. They resumed carrying coal in 1827, because they felt that coal stocks at Grantham were not adequate, but were accused of price-fixing. Although the penalty imposed by Lincoln Assizes was small, they ceased this trade, and the coal merchants agreed to maintain stocks of 2,660 tons at Grantham. In 1833, J. Rofe and his son made <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> a canal to connect Grantham and Sleaford, {{but this was not}} pursued.|$|E
5|$|It {{was again}} {{proposed}} {{as part of}} the New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics.

However, due to shortfalls in the MTA's Capital Program, as well as preexisting funding for the Second Avenue Subway and East Side Access, the MTA could not pay to fund the extension. After <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>for</b> the West Side Stadium, an Olympic stadium to be located above the nearby West Side Yard, was rejected in 2005, New York City quickly lost their Olympic bid.|$|E
