5|$|In Japan, {{health care}} is {{provided}} by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>health</b> insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance. Patients are free to select the physicians or facilities of their choice.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 1993, Clinton {{made a major}} {{speech to}} Congress {{regarding}} a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>health</b> care plan. This {{was one of the}} most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris stated that the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House. Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>health</b> care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, after {{retiring}} from her NUGMW post, Bondfield founded the Women's Group on Public Welfare. She studied labour {{conditions in the}} United States and Mexico during 1938, and toured the US and Canada after the outbreak of war in 1939, as a lecturer for the British Information Services. Her attitude towards the war was different from her semi-pacifist stance of 1914; she actively supported the government and, in 1941, published a booklet, Why Labour Fights. Her main wartime activity was leading {{an investigation by the}} Hygiene Committee of the Women's Group on Public Welfare, into the problems that arose from the large-scale evacuation into the countryside of city children. The group's findings were published in 1943, as Our Towns: a Close-up; the report gave many people their first understanding of the extent of inner-city poverty. Suggested solutions included nursery education, a minimum wage, child allowances and <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>health</b> service. The report was reprinted several times, and was instrumental in developing support for the social reforms introduced by the Labour government that took office in 1945. Among Bondfield's other wartime activities, in 1944 she helped to launch a national drive for the appointment of more women police officers.|$|E

40|$|Background: The Saudi Healthcare System is universal, financed {{entirely from}} {{government}} revenue principally derived from oil, and is â€˜free {{at the point}} of deliveryâ€™ (non-contributory). However, this system is unlikely to be sustainable in the medium to long term. This study investigates the feasibility and acceptability of healthcare financing reform by examining householdsâ€™ willingness to pay (WTP) for <b>a</b> contributory <b>national</b> <b>health</b> insurance scheme. Methods: Using the contingent valuation method, a pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 1187 heads of household in Jeddah province over a 5 -month period. Multi-stage sampling was employed to select the study sample. Using a double-bounded dichotomous choice with the follow-up elicitation method, respondents were asked to state their WTP for <b>a</b> hypothetical contributory <b>national</b> <b>health</b> insurance scheme. Tobit regression analysis was used to examine the factors associated with WTP and assess the construct validity of elicited WTP. Results: Over two-thirds (69. 6 %) indicated that they were willing to participate in and pay for <b>a</b> contributory <b>national</b> <b>health</b> insurance scheme. The mean WTP was 50 Saudi Riyal (US$ 13. 33) per household member per month. Tobit regression analysis showed that household size, satisfaction with the quality of public healthcare services, perceptions about financing healthcare, education and income were the main determinants of WTP. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a theoretically valid WTP for <b>a</b> contributory <b>national</b> <b>health</b> insurance scheme by Saudi people. The research shows that willingness to participate in and pay for <b>a</b> contributory <b>national</b> <b>health</b> insurance scheme depends on participant characteristics. Identifying and understanding the main influencing factors associated with WTP are important to help facilitate establishing and implementing the <b>national</b> <b>health</b> insurance scheme. The results could assist policy-makers to develop and set insurance premiums, thus providing an additional source of healthcare financing...|$|R
