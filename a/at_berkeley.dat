5|$|Further {{experiments}} in 1969 at Dubna and in 1970 <b>at</b> <b>Berkeley</b> demonstrated an actinide chemistry {{for the new}} element, so that by 1970 it was known that element 103 is the last actinide. In 1970, the Dubna group reported the synthesis of 255103 with half-life 20s and alpha decay energy 8.38MeV. However, {{it was not until}} 1971, when the nuclear physics team at the University of California <b>at</b> <b>Berkeley</b> successfully performed a whole series of experiments aimed at measuring the nuclear decay properties of the lawrencium isotopes with mass numbers from 255 through 260, that all previous results from Berkeley and Dubna were confirmed, apart from the Berkeley's group initial erroneous assignment of their first produced isotope to 257103 instead of the probably correct 258103. All final doubts were finally dispelled in 1976 and 1977 when the energies of X-rays emitted from 258103 were measured.|$|E
