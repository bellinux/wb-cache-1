5000|$|The next {{generation}} of watchmaking focuses on <b>anti-magnetic</b> movements. According to studies by the COSC, the majority of watches in for service from 4+ years are primarily suffering accuracy issues due to magnetized movements. Many Swiss watch institutions have made additional efforts to alleviate the problem of magnetization. Some of the technology and practices include iron cages around the movement, silicon hairspring (Omega) (spring in the balance wheel of the escapement), Parachrom hairspring (Rolex), induction of plastic parts, and using non-magnetic metals. Only until recently has any watch maker made a fully <b>anti-magnetic</b> movement. The first watch with over 15,000 Gauss was the Omega Aqua Terra Gauss. The first full <b>anti-magnetic</b> movement and Master Chronometer certified by the COSC is the Omega Constellation [...] "Pie-Pan" [...] Globemaster. This movement is capable of having a see-through case-back (the cal. 8400 in the new SM300) characterized by a movement with fully <b>anti-magnetic</b> parts.

50|$|The Omega <b>Anti-Magnetic</b> Seamasterwas {{announced}} 17 January 2013. According to {{the press}} release, the OMEGA movement does not rely on a protective container inside the watchcase but {{on the use of}} selected non-ferrous materials in the movement itself. The OMEGA prototype was subjected to 1.5 Tesla (15,000 gauss) and continued to perform. Testing showed that the watch was as accurate after its magnetic exposure as it had been before. A live demonstration was then made that offered compelling and conclusive evidence that OMEGA’s new >15,000 gauss movement is a landmark development in watchmaking. OMEGA expects to present the technology at the Baselworld trade fair in April. The new movement, the OMEGA Co-Axial calibre 8508, should be introduced to the market in 2013.|$|E
50|$|On January 17, 2013 Omega {{announced}} {{the creation of}} the world's first movement that is resistant to magnetic fields greater than 1.5 tesla (15,000 gauss), far exceeding the levels of magnetic resistance achieved by any previous movement - a similar movement was used by Daniel Craig as James Bond, though the official collectors watch was labelled as resistant to 15,007 gauss in honor of the fictional secret agent's codename. Most <b>anti-magnetic</b> watches utilize a soft iron - Faraday cage which distributes electromagnetism {{in such a way that}} it cancels the effect on the movement contained within. Omega has instead built a movement of non-ferrous materials eliminating the need for such a cage and providing a far greater resistance to magnetic fields.|$|E

50|$|To {{effectively}} {{protect the}} tank and its crew, tank armour must counter {{a wide variety of}} antitank threats. Protection against kinetic energy penetrators and high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) shells fired by other tanks is of primary importance, but tank armour also aims to protect against infantry Mortars, Grenades, rocket-propelled grenades, anti-tank guided missiles, anti-tank mines, anti-tank rifles, bombs, direct artillery hits, and (less often) nuclear, biological and chemical threats, any of which could disable or destroy a tank or its crew.Steel armour plate was the earliest type of armour. The Germans pioneered the use of face hardened steel during World War II and the Soviets also achieved improved protection with sloped armour technology. World War II developments led to the obsolescence of homogeneous steel armour with the development of shaped-charge warheads, exemplified by the Panzerfaust and bazooka infantry weapons which were effective, despite some early success with spaced armour. Magnetic mines {{led to the development of}} <b>anti-magnetic</b> paste and paint.|$|E
5000|$|Wing Commander Humphrey de Verd Leigh, an RAF {{personnel}} officer, came up {{with his}} own solution after chatting with returning air crew. This was to mount a searchlight under the aircraft, pointed forward and allowing the submarine to be spotted {{as soon as the}} light was turned on. He then developed the Leigh Light entirely on his own, in secret and without official sanction—even the Air Ministry were unaware of its development until shown the completed prototype. At first it was difficult to fit on aircraft due to its size. Leigh persisted in his efforts to test the idea, and garnered the support of the Commander-in-Chief of Coastal Command, Sir Frederick Bowhill. In March 1941 a Vickers Wellington DWI that conveniently already had the necessary generator on board, (it had been used for <b>anti-magnetic</b> mining operations using a large electromagnet) was modified with a retractable [...] "dustbin" [...] holding the lamp, and proved the concept sound.|$|E
50|$|Also in 1968, Omega transitioned {{the caliber}} 321 {{movement}} to the new caliber 861, also designed by Albert Piguet, {{with the introduction of}} the reference 145.022 Speedmaster. The 861 was very similar to the 321, but replaced its column wheel switching mechanism with a cam and increased the beat rate from 18,000 to 21,600 vibrations per hour. Most Speedmaster Professional watches from 1968 to the present have used variants of this movement, including the modern rhodium-plated caliber 1861 and decorated exhibition calibers 863 and 1863. A standard Speedmaster Professional model with Plexiglas crystal, solid caseback with anti-vibration and <b>anti-magnetic</b> dust cover, tachymeter scale, without date or day complications, and powered by a caliber 861-based movement has been continuously produced since. The tritium-powered phosphorescent lume on the hands and index markers of the original watches were replaced {{at the end of the}} 1990s with non-radioactive pigments, but the fundamental design, dimensions, and mechanism of these watches have remained unchanged. In this form, the basic Speedmaster line has remained flight-qualified for NASA space missions and EVAs, after re-evaluation by NASA in 1972 and for use in the Space Shuttle program in 1978. The current such model is reference 311.30.42.30.01.005 (since 2014).|$|E
