40|$|Generalizing the L-Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (L-KS) kernel {{from our}} earlier work, we give a novel explicit-kernel {{formulation}} useful {{for a large}} class of fourth order deterministic, stochastic, linear, and nonlinear PDEs in multispatial dimensions. These include pattern formation equations like the Swift-Hohenberg and many other prominent and new PDEs. We first establish existence, uniqueness, and sharp dimension-dependent spatio-temporal Hölder regularity for the canonical (zero drift) L-KS SPDE, driven by white noise on {×}_d= 1 ^ 3. The spatio-temporal Hölder exponents {{are exactly the same}} as the striking ones we proved for our recently introduced Brownian-time Brownian motion (BTBM) stochastic integral equation, associated with time-fractional PDEs. The challenge here is that, unlike the positive BTBM density, the L-KS kernel is the Gaussian average of a modified, highly oscillatory, and complex Schrödinger propagator. We use a combination of harmonic and delicate analysis to get the necessary estimates. Second, <b>attaching</b> <b>order</b> parameters to the L-KS spatial operator and to the noise term, we show that the dimension-dependent critical ratio /^d/ 8 controls the limiting behavior of the L-KS SPDE, as, 0; and we compare this behavior to that of the less regular second order heat SPDEs. Finally, we give a change-of-measure equivalence between the canonical L-KS SPDE and nonlinear L-KS SPDEs. In particular, we prove uniqueness in law for the Swift-Hohenberg and the law equivalence [...] -and hence the same Hölder regularity [...] -of the Swift-Hohenberg SPDE and the canonical L-KS SPDE on compacts in one-to-three dimensions. Comment: 31 page, 2 Appendices. v 6 identical to v 5 (only fixed title appearance (no)). v 5 is the final version incorporating referee's suggestions: cosmetic changes in title & abstract, expanded discussion of second result (Theorem 1. 2 Sec 1. 4. 2) & included a comparison to the heat SPDE, the Swift-Hohenberg result is now separate (Corollary 1. 1), & other minor enhancements & typos correction...|$|E

2500|$|In August 1941, the 707th Infantry Division was {{deployed}} to the Eastern Front to undertake security duties {{in the occupied}} regions of the Soviet Union behind Army Group Centre's front lines. In October 1941, personnel of the division conducted public hangings of resistance members in Minsk, including that of 17 year old Masha Bruskina. The 707th Infantry Division and <b>attached</b> <b>Order</b> Police units murdered over 10,000 individuals, {{most of whom were}} Jews, in Belorussia between October and November 1941. Almost all of the division's officers and enlisted personnel willingly took part in these killings; the small number who refused were only lightly punished. This operation was initiated by von Bechtolsheim, who issued orders explicitly calling for the [...] "annihilation" [...] and [...] "extermination" [...] of Jews.

In addition to Event V valve configurations, we are continuing our efforts to review other configurations located at high pressure/low pressure system boundaries for their potential risk contribution to an intersystem LOCA.

50|$|Around 10:30 a.m. General Erich Marcks, {{commander}} of the German LXXXIV Corps to which 21st Panzer Division was <b>attached,</b> <b>ordered</b> the entire 21st to leave a single company from the division's 22nd Panzer Regiment {{to deal with the}} paratroopers and move the rest of the division to attack the British forces advancing from the beachhead toward Caen. Feuchtinger finally ordered his division forward, but leaving a company of panzers as ordered, but also leaving Luck's 125 Panzergrenadier Regiment. This order was later countermanded, this time from 7th Army, and only Luck's detachment was left to attack the paratroopers east of Orne. The confusion and inflexibility of the German command situation markedly delayed the German response. Nevertheless, at 1700 p.m. Luck attempted to break through to the Orne river bridges at Bénouville with his armoured personnel carriers, but heavy fire from the warships supporting the British paratroopers, under Major John Howard, holding the bridges drove his forces back. Added to this, more British paratroopers landed in the rear area of the regiment, causing some of Luck's forces to fall back.|$|R
