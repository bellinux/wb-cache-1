5000|$|So {{it is an}} {{isomorphism}} if {{and only}} if , which is the case if [...] is a regular ring. So in this case one can really use the family of finite subgroups.

One has to extend the conjecture to <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>family</b> of subgroups which contains all the counterexamples. Currently no counterexamples for the Farrell-Jones conjecture are known.

30|$|Family size {{measured}} in terms of adult equivalent is an indicator of labor availability, and it has a positive influence to participate in off-farm activities. This is consistent with the results by Tassew et al. (2000) in such <b>a</b> way that <b>large</b> <b>family</b> size increases the households’ participation in off-farm works since <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>family</b> size requires relatively higher marginal income. This means that participation in off-farm activities can maintain the burden of <b>large</b> <b>family</b> size. Thus, households with <b>large</b> <b>family</b> size would have abundant labor and send some of the family members to off-farm activities.|$|R
