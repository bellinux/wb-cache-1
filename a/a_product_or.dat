5|$|The new {{block grant}} program {{differed}} {{significantly from the}} former Food Stamp program in three major ways. First, the new NAP program was designed to distribute the benefits through physical cheques, ensuring that the benefit would be payable only to the beneficiary {{while at the same}} time reducing administrative costs, since the former physical vouchers (cupones in Spanish) were subject to storage and accountability problems, theft, counterfeiting and even trafficking. Second, the benefits were no longer restricted to vouchers redeemable only for food, but were provided in cash. The beneficiary could then elect to purchase <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>or</b> select services other than food. Third, the overall assistance provided to Puerto Rico was limited to an annual block appropriation, requiring the Puerto Rican government to adjust its program management to allocate the funds. Between 1982 and 1986, the U.S. Congress awarded $825 million annually in block grants for NAP program, and since then the appropriations have steadily increased by an estimated 3% to 4% to compensate for inflation. It has surpassed $1 billion annually since the early 1990s, and increased 30% from 1993 to 2002. Since fiscal year 2006, the appropriation has reached over $1.5 billion annually.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{driver of}} direct human {{impacts on the}} environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption {{of goods and services}} can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service), resource intensity, and resource productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are food, energy, materials and water.|$|E

50|$|Disconfirmation {{of beliefs}} {{refers to the}} {{judgments}} or evaluations that a person makes with respect to <b>a</b> <b>product,</b> service, <b>or</b> technology artifact. These evaluations or judgments are made {{in comparison to the}} person’s original expectations. When <b>a</b> <b>product,</b> service, <b>or</b> technology artifact outperforms the person’s original expectations, the disconfirmation is positive, which is posited to increase post-purchase or post-adoption satisfaction. When <b>a</b> <b>product,</b> service, <b>or</b> technology artifact underperforms the person’s original expectations, the disconfirmation is negative, which is posited to decrease post-purchase or post-adoption satisfaction (i.e., to increase dissatisfaction).|$|R
25|$|Arbitration {{agreements}} are sometimes contained in ancillary agreements, {{or in small}} print in other agreements, and consumers and employees often do not know in advance that they have agreed to mandatory binding pre-dispute arbitration by purchasing <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>or</b> taking a job.|$|E
25|$|Trademark law is {{designed}} to fulfill the public policy objective of consumer protection, by preventing the public from being misled as to the origin or quality of <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service. By identifying the commercial source of products and services, trademarks facilitate identification of products and services which meet the expectations of consumers as to quality and other characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Motivated {{purposes}} of art refer to intentional, conscious {{actions on the}} part of the artists or creator.

50|$|Validation is {{intended}} to ensure <b>a</b> <b>product,</b> service, <b>or</b> system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) results in <b>a</b> <b>product,</b> service, <b>or</b> system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) that meets the operational needs of the user. For a new development flow or verification flow, validation procedures may involve modeling either flow and using simulations to predict faults or gaps {{that might lead to}} invalid or incomplete verification <b>or</b> development of <b>a</b> <b>product,</b> service, <b>or</b> system (or portion thereof, or set thereof). A set of validation requirements (as defined by the user), specifications, and regulations may then be used as a basis for qualifying a development flow or verification flow for <b>a</b> <b>product,</b> service, <b>or</b> system (or portion thereof, or set thereof). Additional validation procedures also include those that are designed specifically to ensure that modifications made to an existing qualified development flow or verification flow will have the effect of producing <b>a</b> <b>product,</b> service, <b>or</b> system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) that meets the initial design requirements, specifications, and regulations; these validations help to keep the flow qualified. It is a process of establishing evidence that provides a high degree of assurance that <b>a</b> <b>product,</b> service, <b>or</b> system accomplishes its intended requirements. This often involves acceptance of fitness for purpose with end users and other product stakeholders. This is often an external process.|$|R

25|$|Distribution (or place) {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{elements}} of the marketing mix. Distribution is the process of making <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service available for the consumer or business user that needs it. This can be done directly by the producer or service provider, or using indirect channels with distributors or intermediaries. The other three elements of the marketing mix are product, pricing, and promotion.|$|E
25|$|Specialized {{types of}} {{trademark}} include certification marks, collective trademarks and defensive trademarks. A trademark which is popularly {{used to describe}} <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service (rather than to distinguish the product or services from those of third parties) is sometimes known as a genericized trademark. If such a mark becomes synonymous with that product or service {{to the extent that}} the trademark owner can no longer enforce its proprietary rights, the mark becomes generic.|$|E
25|$|Elicitation {{of point}} {{estimates}} – Here, {{we try to}} get an estimate (in a single value) of something. For example, estimating the weight of an object, or the release date of <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>or</b> probability of success of a project etc. as are seen in prediction markets like Intrade, HSX or InklingMarkets and also in several implementations of crowdsourced estimation of a numeric outcome.

25|$|By storing {{all this}} {{information}} the vendor can determine the customer needs very precisely whenever a customer requests <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>or</b> an update. As already stated the vendor can also easily inform the customer about some adaptations the customer needs to make to its configuration in order to let the product function properly. Another advantage of storing this information in a system {{is that it will}} ease the process of online delivery. The checking of the configuration needs and constraints can all be done automatically when a customer does a request.|$|E
25|$|Ecological {{economics}} now {{seeks to}} bridge the gap between ecology and traditional neoclassical economics: it provides an inclusive and ethical economic model for society. A plethora of new concepts to help implement and measure sustainability are becoming more widely accepted including the car-free movement, smart growth (more sustainable urban environments), life cycle assessment (the cradle to cradle analysis of resource use and environmental impact over the life cycle of <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>or</b> process), ecological footprint analysis, green building, dematerialization (increased recycling of materials), decarbonisation (removing dependence on fossil fuels) and much more.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} few seasons, the {{contestant}} would first meet the panel up close, for a casual inspection, and the panel was allowed one initial guess. Beginning in 1955 Daly simply greeted and seated the contestant, who then met the panel {{at the end of}} the game. Additionally, starting April 17, 1955, the panel stopped taking initial guesses. The contestant's line was then revealed to the studio and home audiences, and Daly would tell the panel whether the contestant was salaried or self-employed, and from 1960 on, dealt in <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>or</b> a service.|$|E
25|$|Consumer {{behaviour}} is {{the study}} of the motivations surrounding a purchase of <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service. It has been linked to the field of psychology, sociology and economics in attempts to analyse when, why, where and how people purchase {{in the way that they}} do. However, little literature has considered the link between our consumption behaviour and the basics of our being, our biology. Segmentation by biological driven demographics such as sex and age are already popular and pervasive in marketing. As more knowledge and research is known, targeting based on a consumers biology is of growing interest and use to marketers.|$|E
25|$|Corporations {{manage their}} supply chain to take {{advantage}} of cheaper costs of production. A supply chain is a system of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in moving <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service from supplier to customer. Supply chain activities involve the transformation of natural resources, raw materials, and components into a finished product that is delivered to the end customer. In sophisticated supply chain systems, used products may re-enter the supply chain at any point where residual value is recyclable. Supply chains link value chains. Supply and demand can be very fickle, depending on factors such as the weather, consumer demand, and large orders placed by multinational corporations.|$|E
