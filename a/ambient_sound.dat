The player can load a SoundFont and use it for <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> effects. Customised SoundFonts can be created to personalise the dungeon. The game features three SoundFonts, {{one of which is}} loaded at game startup, and Creative offered sample Dungeon Keeper SoundFonts for download.|$|E
5|$|Black Cherry is {{the second}} studio album by English {{electronic}} music duo Goldfrapp, released on 23 April 2003 by Mute Records. It marked {{a departure from the}} <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> of their debut album, Felt Mountain (2000), incorporating glam rock and synthpop music; inspirations were Spanish disco group Baccara and Swedish techno artist Håkan Lidbo. The album was met with positive reviews, with many critics complimenting its blend of retro and modern electropop music.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{development}} was made more simple {{by the use}} of the same game engine to that of its predecessor, though extra dialogue was involved due to the presence of four factions rather than the three in Geneforge. Video game journalists awarded both positive and average review scores, they were impressed by Geneforge 2s plot and replayability but criticized the game's graphics and <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> effects.|$|E

5|$|Frequent radio {{transmissions}} through the player's communications device also {{add to the}} atmosphere, by broadcasting certain sounds and messages from non-player characters meant to unsettle the player. Early in the game, during and directly after the event that plunges the base into chaos, the player often hears the sounds of fighting, screaming and dying through their radio transmitter. The <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> is extended to the base itself through such things as hissing pipes, footsteps, and occasional jarringly loud noises from machinery or other sources. Often ambient sounds can be heard that resemble deep breathing, unexplained voices and demonic taunting from the game's antagonists.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} titles on the Xbox 360, Halo 3 fully {{supports}} 5.1 surround sound audio. In the game, {{there are over}} 50,000 pieces of audio, with nearly 40,000 of those being NPC dialogue. This {{is far more than}} in either of the preceding Halo titles; Halo 2 had over 15,000 pieces of dialogue. The AI controlling this dialogue is designed to ensure the exchanges flow naturally and convincingly. Separate recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to make for a more believable sound experience in the public beta, and the finished game uses Waves Audio plugins to modify dialog and other audio in-game depending on conditions. Distant gunfire sounds, which may first seem like prerecorded <b>ambient</b> <b>sound,</b> may often be the result of an actual firefight happening elsewhere in the game.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack for {{the game}} is an {{original}} score composed by Alex Guilbert. The theme for Saw, a series of plunking piano keys joined by a bass drum and violins, can be heard during the menu screen and the end credits. At some points during the game, a quick tempo score similar to the opening piano track is used to increase suspense during trap and puzzle sequences. A high-pitched tune can be heard during slower parts of the game, which was used to make these parts more ominous. Variations or mixes of these tracks occur throughout the game. The game utilizes a minimalist approach to music, {{with most of the}} <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> being provided by other victims, screaming or taunting protagonist David Tapp. Because the tracks were meant for a video game, there are no vocals; the tracks are much shorter than typical songs and are more abundant.|$|E

5|$|The sound {{equipment}} {{was provided by}} Showco who used the PRISM system, which adapted the show for each venue according to its height, width and the coverage required. The sound was mixed by Front of house engineer Monty Lee Wilkes {{on a combination of}} Yamaha PM4000 and PM3000 consoles, an unusual choice for Spears's shows. He used dbx 903 compressors for kick and snare drums. The compressors were also used on Spears's microphones, a Shure Beta 58A handheld and a Crown CM-311AE headset-mounted capsule. Spears's vocals were mostly live—pre-recorded vocals ran in parallel on an ADAT machine during the shows, and were used to replace her live microphone when the dance routines became too energetic for good voice control. Spears's band, backline technicians and monitor engineer Raza Sufi were all fitted with in-ear monitors and headset mics, enabling rapid and clear communications around the stage area. Spears did not use them, preferring the <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> of a battery of eight Showco SRM wedges spread across the downstage area. These were augmented by Showco SS full-range sidefills and a pair of one-by-18-inch subs {{on each side of the}} stage. Sufi also used a dbx 160A to limit Spears's louder moments, while backing vocalists were controlled by a duo of BSS DPR901 dynamic equalizers. Effects were limited to vocal and drum reverbs. Amplification for the wedges and the FOH system were all Crown-based, with a pair of drum stool shakers completing the line-up. All the cables used during the tour were brought from the US, even in Europe, something unusual in audio production.|$|E

25|$|In July 1993, Sylvian and Fripp {{released}} the collaborative effort The First Day. Other contributors were soon-to-be King Crimson member Trey Gunn on Chapman Stick and Jerry Marotta (who, like Sylvian, almost {{became a member}} of King Crimson) on drums. When the group toured to promote the CD, future King Crimson member Pat Mastelotto took over the drumming spot. The live document Damage was released in 1994, as was the joint venture, Redemption – Approaching Silence, which featured Sylvian's <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> sculptures (Approaching Silence) accompanying Fripp reading his own text (Redemption).|$|E
40|$|The {{expansion}} of {{wind energy production}} creates an increase in wind turbine (WT) noise. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine if a possible reduction of WT noise might be achieved by adding natural <b>ambient</b> <b>sounds,</b> so called auditory masking. A loudness experiment was conducted to explore this possibility, using four <b>ambient</b> <b>sounds</b> of trees, birds and water as maskers. Sixteen listeners assessed the loudness of WT noise heard alone or in the presence of 40 dB masking sounds, using the method of magnitude estimation. Partial masking of WT noise was found in the presence of all <b>ambient</b> <b>sounds.</b> The masking effect corresponded to a dB-reduction of the WT noise from a few dB for signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) close to 0 dB up to around 10 dB at - 15 dB S/N. These results indicate that addition of <b>ambient</b> <b>sounds</b> may be a useful method for masking unwanted noise from wind turbines...|$|R

25|$|Fugazi {{began writing}} the {{material}} for Red Medicine in late 1994, after touring {{in support of}} In on the Kill Taker. The band worked with engineer Don Zientara, but did not choose to work with producer Ted Niceley again. Fugazi opted to retreat from the in-your-face production values of In on the Kill Taker and instead worked to create an <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> which would display greater range and depth. To achieve this, the band handled production duties themselves, and in doing so, became more confident with in-studio experimentation. Red Medicine would take Fugazi a step further toward art rock. The band began an extensive worldwide tour {{in support of the}} album, playing a total of 172 shows between March 1995 and November 1996.|$|E
500|$|Ocean of Sound is a 1996 {{compilation}} album compiled {{and produced}} by English musician and author David Toop. The two-disc, cross-licensed [...] "various artists" [...] compilation contains 32 tracks culled {{from a variety}} of musical sources, including dub, exotica, free jazz, and field recordings. Toop compiled the recordings to serve as both a historical survey of ambient music and an aural companion to his 1995 book Ocean of Sound: Aether Talk, <b>Ambient</b> <b>Sound</b> and Imaginary Worlds.|$|E

Without a tool that communicates <b>ambient</b> <b>sounds</b> in a nonauditory manner, maintaining this awareness is difficult {{for people who are}} deaf. We present an iterative investigation of peripheral, visual displays of <b>ambient</b> <b>sounds.</b> Our major contributions are: (1) a rich understanding of what <b>ambient</b> <b>sounds</b> are useful to people who are deaf, (2) a set of visual and functional requirements for a peripheral sound display, based on feedback from people who are deaf, (3) lab-based evaluations investigating the characteristics of four prototypes, and (4) a set of design guidelines for successful ambient audio displays, based on a comparison of four implemented prototypes and user feedback. Our work provides valuable information about the sound awareness needs of the deaf and can help to inform further design of such applications...|$|R
500|$|Fellini scholar Thomas Van Order {{has pointed}} out that Fellini is equally free in the {{treatment}} of <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> in his films, preferring to cultivate what Chion has called, [...] "a subjective sense of point of audition", in which what is heard on screen mirrors a particular character's perceptions, as opposed to the visible reality of the scene. [...] As an example, ducks and chickens appear on the screen throughout Gelsomina's conversation with the nun, but, reflecting the girl's growing sense of enlightenment concerning her place in the world, the quacking and clucking of barnyard fowl dissolves into the chirping of songbirds.|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{the sound}} of Frozen, {{director}} Jennifer Lee stated that sound played a huge part in making the film [...] "visceral" [...] and [...] "transported"; she explained, [...] "n letting it tell the story emotionally, {{the sound of}} the ice when it's at its most dangerous just makes you shudder." [...] The complete silence at the climax of the film right after Anna freezes was Lasseter's idea, one he [...] "really wanted". In that scene, even the <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> that would normally be there was taken out {{in order to make it}} feel unusual. Lee explained [...] "that was a moment where we wanted everything to feel suspended." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, David Toop {{published}} his second book, Ocean of Sound: Aether Talk, <b>Ambient</b> <b>Sound</b> and Imaginary Worlds, which examined {{music as a}} medium for deep mental involvement. In the book, Toop said that ambient music {{can be defined as}} music listened for relaxation or music that [...] "taps into the disturbing, chaotic undertow of the environment". As an aural companion to the book, Toop curated the compilation album Ocean of Sound, which would also serve as a historical survey of ambient music. The album was released in January 1996 by Virgin Records. It later went out of print, which music journalist Michaelangelos Matos said was because such cross-licensed compilation albums [...] "seldom stay available for very long".|$|E

500|$|In September 1948, Besman {{arranged}} recording {{sessions for}} Hooker at United Sound studios in Detroit. [...] Several songs were recorded with Hooker's vocals and amplified guitar. [...] To make the sound fuller, a microphone {{was set up}} in a pallet that was placed under Hooker's foot. [...] According to Besman's account, a primitive echo-chamber effect was created by feeding Hooker's foot-stomp rhythm into a speaker in a toilet bowl, which in turn was miked and returned to a speaker in the studio in front of Hooker's guitar, thus giving it a [...] "big" [...] or more <b>ambient</b> <b>sound.</b> Three takes of Hooker's performance were recorded, the last providing the master for [...] "Boogie Chillen'".|$|E
500|$|The {{final game}} shipped {{with very little}} music, instead relying on the ambient sounds of the {{environment}} which was developed by Wabi Sabi Sound. Blow felt that the addition of music was a [...] "layer of stuff that works against the game". The <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> effects were made more difficult to include as the island the game takes place on lacks any other animal-based lifeform, making the player aware how alone they are while on the island. Most of the ambient sounds were recorded by Andrew Lackey of Wabi Sabi Sound, capturing them while walking around Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay. Lackey layered the various sound effects as to enable many different variations depending on the player's location on the island while also providing seamless transition from one environment to the next.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{were more}} {{critical}} concerning the game's sound. Although {{the quality of}} the musical compositions was praised, both RPGFan and RPGamer found that there were too few adequately long tracks, with mediocre <b>ambient</b> <b>sound</b> effects to fill the dead time, and Scary Larry complained of the player character's dog [...] "constantly" [...] barking. Super Play and GamePro both found that the game was not up to the standards held by other Square games. Others argued that Secret of Evermore was a decent first attempt by the American team. Game Players anticipated another game from the same development team, and a critic for Next Generation said that while the game suffered from a number of amateur mistakes, [...] "as a debut title for a new team of designers, it points to a rosy future".|$|E
