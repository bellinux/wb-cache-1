A digital telephone system was introduced in 1983 and mobile phones came in 1992. Before 1980, most of the domestic appliances and equipments were imported, except the one-band radio, but after 1980 many <b>assembly</b> <b>plants</b> for radio, television, audio and video cassette recorders and players were established.|$|R

5|$|After {{descending}} into Burlington, the QEW crosses former Highway2 {{before it}} encounters the Freeman Interchange, opened in 1958 to allow construction of Highway403 and expanded in 1999 to accommodate Highway407. The freeway curves to the east, becoming concurrent with Highway403 through Burlington and Oakville within Halton Region. The two routes travel east straight though a commercial office area. Service roads reappear through this stretch to serve businesses fronting the highway. The segment includes high-occupancy vehicle lanes, opened in 2011, which required {{the construction of}} a second structure over Sixteen Mile Creek. In the eastern end of Oakville, the route curves northeast, passing the Ford Motor <b>Assembly</b> <b>Plant.</b> Highway403 diverges and travels north as the QEW curves back to the east and enters Mississauga and Peel Region.|$|E
5|$|Continuing eastward, I-496 passes {{north of}} the <b>assembly</b> <b>plant</b> complex {{and south of the}} central {{business}} district. East of a partial interchange with Walnut Street, the freeway passes the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame, which is located on I-496's southern service drive. The south side of the freeway is adjacent to Cooley Gardens near the confluence of the Grand and Red Cedar rivers. I-496 crosses the Grand River downstream from the confluence and meets the eastern terminus of the Capitol Loop. This interchange with Cedar and Larch streets is also a connection to Business Loop I-96 (BL I-96) and Pennsylvania Avenue. St. Joseph Street ends after the connection to Pennsylvania Avenue. The main freeway crosses a rail line owned by CSX Transportation. I-496 runs parallel to {{the north side of the}} rail line while Malcolm X Street follows to the south as far as the Clemens Avenue overpass.

He invested an additional $50 million to refurbish outlets and $20 {{million on a}} new computer system to link outlet cash registers to the kitchen, drive-through window, manager's office and company headquarters. Cranor also expanded the chain into non-traditional locations, beginning with a 150 sq ft limited menu kiosk at a General Motors <b>assembly</b> <b>plant</b> in Dayton, Ohio. Between 1986 and 1991, the chain built a further 2,000 outlets to bring its total number to 8,500, and sales grew from $3.5 to $6.2 billion. The chain {{had to contend with}} the rise of grilled chicken as Americans became increasingly health conscious. KFC found itself competing against the growing El Pollo Loco restaurant chain, as well as with Burger King, which had just introduced the BK Broiler, a grilled chicken burger. Delays in product development, cramped kitchens and the ongoing franchisee contract dispute prevented the chain from rolling out a grilled product of its own.|$|E
5|$|I-496 {{starts at}} an {{interchange}} with I-96/I-69 at that freeway's exit95 in Delta Township in Eaton County. The freeway runs eastward through suburban {{areas of the}} township adjacent to some residential subdivisions. Continuing eastward, there is an interchange for Creyts Road before I-496 angles to the northeast. At the interchange with Waverly Road, I-496 crosses into Ingham County. The freeway then runs parallel to the Grand River. Near a partial interchange with Lansing Road (old US27), the freeway gains a pair of service drives: St. Joseph Street runs one-way westbound on the north side, and Malcolm X Street runs eastbound to the south. The next interchange is for the connection to the Capitol Loop and M-99, both of which run along Martin Luther King Boulevard. The Capitol Loop, also internally numbered Connector 496, is a signed connector that provides access to various state government buildings like the Michigan State Capitol. South of this interchange, M-99 connects to the Lansing Car <b>Assembly</b> <b>plant,</b> a former facility for Oldsmobile.|$|E

There are three main urban markets in Enugu: Ogbete Market, Awkunanaw Market and New Market. New Market is a major market for the sale of garri. Ogbete market is patronised by merchants from all over the surrounding area, including merchants from cities like Onitsha, Aguleri, Abakaliki and Aba. In Ogebete market non-food goods are also sold. Brewing and soft-drink bottling are among other industries in the city; there is also a Mercedes <b>assembly</b> <b>plant</b> as well as the production and manufacturing of machinery, pottery, tiles, steel, cement, asbestos, petroleum, and pharmaceuticals.

40|$|The {{motor vehicle}} {{industry}} in the U. S. spends about $ 3. 6 billion on energy annually. In this report, we focus on auto <b>assembly</b> <b>plants.</b> In the U. S., over 70 <b>assembly</b> <b>plants</b> currently produce 13 million cars and trucks each year. In <b>assembly</b> <b>plants,</b> energy expenditures is a relatively small cost factor in the total production process. Still, as manufacturers face an increasingly competitive environment, energy efficiency improvements can provide a means to reduce costs without negatively affecting the yield or {{the quality of the}} product. In addition, reducing energy costs reduces the unpredictability associated with variable energy prices in today?s marketplace, which could negatively affect predictable earnings, an important element for publicly-traded companies such as those in the motor vehicle industry. In this report, we first present a summary of the motor vehicle assembly process and energy use. This is followed by a discussion of energy efficiency opportunities available for <b>assembly</b> <b>plants.</b> Where available, we provide specific primary energy savings for each energy efficiency measure based on case studies, as well as references to technical literature. If available, we have listed costs and typical payback periods. We include experiences of <b>assembly</b> <b>plants</b> worldwide with energy efficiency measures reviewed in the report. Our findings suggest that although most motor vehicle companies in the U. S. have energy management teams or programs, there are still opportunities available at individual plants to reduce energy consumption cost effectively. Further research on the economics of the measures for individual <b>assembly</b> <b>plants,</b> as part of an energy management program, is needed to assess the potential impact of selected technologies at these plants...|$|R

Following the departure of Major General Thomas Farrell, Nichols became Groves' deputy, although he also continued as district engineer. Asked {{to spend more time}} on weapons production and storage, Nichols established a new underground <b>assembly</b> <b>plant</b> at the Mound Laboratories in Miamisburg, Ohio, and recommended that Sandia Base be transferred from the United States Army Air Corps to the Manhattan District. In December, Nichols recommended the closing down of the alpha tracks of the Y-12 plant, thereby cutting the payroll from 8,600 to 1,500 and saving $2 million a month. Henceforth, uranium enrichment would be performed by the gaseous diffusion plants, the wartime K-25 and the new K-27, which had commenced operation in January 1946.|$|E

During the 1990s, Holden, other Australian automakers and trade unions pressured the Australian Government to halt the lowering of car import tariffs. By 1997, {{the federal government had}} already cut tariffs to 22.5percent, from 57.5percent ten years earlier; by 2000, a plan was formulated to reduce the tariffs to 15percent. Holden was critical, saying that Australia's population was not large enough, and that the changes could tarnish the local industry.|$|E
5|$|Paris's {{manufacturing}} {{is mostly}} focused in its suburbs, {{and the city}} itself has only around 75,000 manufacturing workers, {{most of which are}} in the textile, clothing, leather goods, and shoe trades. Paris region manufacturing specialises in transportation, mainly automobiles, aircraft and trains, but this is in a sharp decline: Paris proper manufacturing jobs dropped by 64 percent between 1990 and 2010, and the Paris region lost 48 percent during the same period. Most of this is due to companies relocating outside the Paris region. The Paris region's 800 aerospace companies employed 100,000. Four hundred automobile industry companies employ another 100,000 workers: many of these are centred in the Yvelines department around the Renault and PSA-Citroen plants (this department alone employs 33,000), but the industry as a whole suffered a major loss with the 2014 closing of a major Aulnay-sous-Bois Citroen <b>assembly</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E
