25|$|A rash of unexplained miscarriages in Sheffield, England were {{attributed}} to lead poisoning caused by the metal pipes which fed the city's water supply. Soon, women began using diachylon, a substance with {{a high concentration of}} lead, as an <b>abortifacient.</b> In 1898, a woman confessed to having used diachylon to induce a miscarriage. The use of diachylon became prevalent in the English Midlands up until World War I. Criminal investigation of an abortionist in Calgary, Alberta in 1894 revealed through chemical analysis that the concoction he had supplied to a man seeking an <b>abortifacient</b> contained Spanish fly.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{explored}} {{reproductive health}} care in rural Washington State, reasons given by providers for not offering abortions, and providers' willingness to use medical <b>abortifacients.</b> METHODS: Physicians, midwives, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants in rural Washington completed an inventory of reproductive health services that they provide, whether and why they do not perform abortions, and whether they would use medical <b>abortifacients.</b> RESULTS: Of the respondents, 89. 2 % reported providing {{reproductive health care}}. Only 1. 2 % reported performing surgical abortions, and 26. 1 % {{indicated that they would}} probably prescribe medical <b>abortifacients.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Few providers offer surgical abortions in rural Washington.

25|$|Botanical {{preparations}} {{reputed to}} be <b>abortifacient</b> were common in classical literature and folk medicine.

25|$|The ancient Greeks {{relied upon}} the herb silphium as an <b>abortifacient</b> and contraceptive. The plant, {{as the chief}} export of Cyrene, was driven to extinction, but it is {{suggested}} that it might have possessed the same abortive properties as some of its closest extant relatives in the Apiaceae family. Silphium was so central to the Cyrenian economy that most of its coins were embossed with an image of the plant.|$|E

40|$|Most naturalists and {{physicians}} {{were part of}} these imperial enterprises to encourage popu-lation growth. Even when European natural-ists {{and physicians}} in the West Indies did learn about new <b>abortifacients,</b> they chose not to disseminate their knowledge. Their counter-parts in Europe, similarly, had little incentive to promote the use of <b>abortifacients,</b> or even to study them. Limiting population was sim-ply anathema to the prevailing goals of late 18 th-century science and government. The book does leave some questions unanswered. Religious groups {{play a central role}} in contemporary debates over contra-ception and abortion, so their absence from Schiebinger’s account is striking. Some ex-planation of organized religion’s involve-ment (or non-involvement) in the 18 th-century debates would have been helpful. This reservation aside, Plants and Empire presents a subtle and compelling explana-tion for why knowledge of West Indian <b>abortifacients</b> was not taken up by scientists in Europe. More broadly, Schiebinger illus-trates the explanatory power of agnotology. Her study of scientific ignorance demon-strates that understanding what scientists do not know is just as important as understand-ing what they do know...|$|R

25|$|Early-term {{surgical}} abortions {{are generally}} available around Australia for {{those women who}} seek them. The procedure is partially funded under Medicare, the government-funded public health scheme, or by private healthcare insurers. Prosecutions against medical practitioners for performing abortions have not occurred for decades, with one exception – a prosecution in 1998 in Western Australia that soon after led to the explicit legalisation of on-request abortions under certain circumstances in that state. RU-486, an <b>abortifacient</b> widely used overseas, has been available in Australia only since February 2006.|$|E

None of these uses has been scientifically verified as effective. In the West Indies, a few drops of the latex is added to milk and used as an emetic.|$|E
25|$|In {{countries}} where the dominant religion is Catholicism, abortions are higher per capita than the worldwide average, says the Alan Guttmacher Institute. The estimated number of abortions per year in Brazil is roughly 1million to 2million. Peru, another Catholic country, each year sees abortions initiated by 5% of women in their childbearing years, whereas 3% of such women have abortions in the U.S. Catholics for Choice reports that Italy—97% Catholic—is 74% in favor of using Mifepristone, an <b>abortifacient.</b> A majority of Catholics in Bolivia, Colombia and Mexico say that abortion should be allowed {{in at least some}} circumstances.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} juniper, known as savin, was {{mentioned}} frequently in European writings. In one case in England, a rector from Essex {{was said to}} have procured it for a woman he had impregnated in 1574; in another, a man wishing to remove his girlfriend of like condition recommended to her that black hellebore and savin be boiled together and drunk in milk, or else that chopped madder be boiled in beer. Other substances reputed to have been used by the English include Spanish fly, opium, watercress seed, iron sulphate, and iron chloride. Another mixture, not <b>abortifacient,</b> but rather intended to relieve missed abortion, contained dittany, hyssop, and hot water.|$|E
25|$|In those {{patients}} not suited for {{or unwilling to}} undergo surgery, several drugs {{have been found to}} inhibit cortisol synthesis (e.g. ketoconazole, metyrapone) but they are of limited efficacy. Mifepristone is a powerful glucocorticoid type II receptor antagonist and, since it does not interfere with normal cortisol homeostatis type I receptor transmission, may be especially useful for treating the cognitive effects of Cushing's syndrome. However, the medication faces considerable controversy due to its use as an <b>abortifacient.</b> In February 2012, the FDA approved mifepristone to control high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) in adult patients who are not candidates for surgery, or who did not respond to prior surgery, with the warning that mifepristone should never be used by pregnant women.|$|E
25|$|<b>Abortifacient</b> {{advertising}} {{was highly}} {{effective in the}} United States, though apparently less so across the Atlantic. Contemporary estimates of mid-19th century abortion rates in the United States suggest between 20% - 25% of all pregnancies in the United States during that era ended in abortion. This era also saw a marked shift in those who were obtaining abortions. Before {{the start of the}} 19th century, most abortions were sought by unmarried women who had become pregnant out of wedlock. But, out of 54 abortion cases published in American medical journals between 1839 and 1880, over half were sought by married women, and of the married women well over 60 percent already had at least one child. In the post-Civil War era, much of the blame was placed on the burgeoning women's rights movement.|$|E
