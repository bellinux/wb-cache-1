Since 2000 the National Evangelical Christian Fellowship, with 2,800 member churches, has organised these fasts and they are ongoing event as of 2010. All previous fasts have ended on Independence Day but the 2010 fast is followed by Malaysia Day and thus {{for the first time}} coincided with Ramadan.|$|E

25|$|The {{specific}} rituals {{engaged in}} by the king are only rudimentarily known. The Post-Classic Kʻicheʻ king together with his dignitaries regularly visited the temples to burn offerings <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> the prosperity of his people, while fasting and guarding sexual abstinence. As to the Classic Period king, he appears at times (often period-ending dates) to be scattering blood, incense or, perhaps, maize. At other times, the king, represented by the hero Hunahpu, is sacrificing his own blood in front of directional trees (murals of San Bartolo), or he is officiating in front of such a tree (temple sanctuaries of Palenque).|$|E
25|$|Jews {{observe a}} Day of Atonement Yom Kippur {{on the day}} before God makes {{decisions}} regarding what will happen during the coming year. Just prior to Yom Kippur, Jews will ask forgiveness of those they have wronged during the prior year (if they have not already done so). During Yom Kippur itself, Jews fast <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> God's forgiveness for the transgressions they have made against God in the prior year. Sincere repentance is required, and once again, God can only forgive one for the sins one has committed against God; this is why it is necessary for Jews also to seek the forgiveness of those people who they have wronged.|$|E
25|$|Catholic social {{teaching}} {{is based on}} the teaching of Jesus and commits Catholics to the welfare of others. Although the Catholic Church operates numerous social ministries throughout the world, individual Catholics are also required to practice spiritual and corporal works of mercy. Corporal works of mercy include feeding the hungry, welcoming strangers, immigrants or refugees, clothing the naked, taking care of the sick and visiting those in prison. Spiritual works require the Catholic to share their knowledge with others, to give advice to those who need it, comfort those who suffer, have patience, forgive those who hurt them, give correction to those who need it, <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> the living and the dead. The sacrament of Anointing of the Sick, however, is performed by a priest, who will anoint with oil the head and hands of the ill person and pray a special prayer for them while laying on hands.|$|E

25|$|Being a hub of {{waterway}} transport, Tuen Mun attracted fishermen {{communities in}} the ancient times. The fishermen wished to enjoy the protection and blessings of the heavenly goddess Tin Hau and built a temple at Hau Kok in Kau Hui to worship her <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> safety. During the Ming Dynasty, the To clansmen, who were engaged in the salt business, migrated to Tuen Mun. They developed close ties with local fishermen and worked together {{for the expansion of}} the Temple. People living in the walled villages also helped in financing its renovation on a number of occasions. The Temple has always been well patronised by worshippers. During the Tin Hau Festival (i.e. the 23rd day of the third month in the Chinese calendar) every year, villagers and fishermen hold a series of celebrations in the open space in front of the temple. They pray for prosperity and peace by staging thanksgiving opera performances as well as dragon and lion dances. Every year, Lunar New Year fair will be organised in the square in front of Tin Hau Temple. Besides, it is also a place for earthen pot gathering.|$|E

Mezireh, as a community, was alive and well. Harput (Kharpert), on the other hand was dead, a bleak landscape of debris where once proudly stood a college, schools, churches, shops and homes.

Due to the volatile state of the world and out of sensitivity and respect to the armed forces, who I support <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for,</b> I do not want to risk offending anyone who might misinterpret the meaning of this video." [...] After pulling the original video, it was then released an edited version that premiered on April 16, 2003 on VH1, immediately after a special program called Madonna Speaks. This version features Madonna singing in front of a backdrop of ever-changing flags of different countries.|$|E

500|$|Away {{from his}} expeditions, Shackleton's life was {{generally}} restless and unfulfilled. In {{his search for}} rapid pathways to wealth and security, he launched business ventures which failed to prosper, and he died heavily in debt. Upon his death, he was lauded in the press, but was thereafter largely forgotten, while the heroic reputation of his rival Scott was sustained for many decades. Later in the 20th century, Shackleton was [...] "rediscovered", and rapidly became {{a role model for}} leadership as one who, in extreme circumstances, kept his team together in a survival story described by cultural historian Stephanie Barczewski as [...] "incredible". In his 1956 address to the British [...] Association, Sir Raymond Priestley, one of his contemporaries, said [...] "Scott for scientific method, Amundsen for speed and efficiency but when disaster strikes and all hope is gone, get down on your knees <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> Shackleton", paraphrasing what Apsley Cherry-Garrard had written in a preface to The Worst Journey in the World.|$|E
500|$|... "The General Operation" [...] ("L'Opération Générale") : Established by Antoine in 1910, {{it begins}} and ends with three strokes of bell. It is briefly {{announced}} by a dressed member. After meditating in a room {{on the back of}} the temple, a desservant climb to the highest platform, and the dressed follower goes to the other platform. Both are standing <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> a few minutes to transmit the fluid to the churchgoers. Then, if the reading of the sacred texts is scheduled just after, as it is the case in France, the desservant whispers to the dressed follower to perform the reading. Originally Antoine practiced this form of worship only on holidays (except Sundays) and on the 1st and 15th days of each month, before extending it to the first four days of the week. It was in 1932 that the General Operation was performed in all Antoinist temples, and no longer only in the one of Jemeppe; furthermore, on 3 December 1933, Catherine decided that the ritual would be also perform every Sunday.|$|E
500|$|In 1009 Wulfstan {{wrote the}} edict that Æthelred II issued {{calling for the}} whole nation to fast <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> three days during Thorkell's raids on England, in a {{national}} act of penance. Only water and bread were to be eaten, people should walk to church barefoot, a payment of one penny from each hide of land was to be made, and everyone should attend Mass {{every day of the}} three days. Anyone not participating would be fined or flogged. After Cnut conquered England, Wulfstan quickly became an advisor to the new king, as evidenced by Wulfstan's influence on the law code issued by Cnut. After the death of Lyfing, Archbishop of Canterbury in 1020, Wulfstan consecrated his successor Æthelnoth in 1020, and wrote to Cnut asking the king to grant the same rights and dignities for the new archbishop that previous archbishops had held. Wulfstan also wrote the laws that were issued by Cnut at Winchester in 1021 or 1022. These laws continued in force throughout the 11th century, as they were the laws referred to in Domesday Book as [...] "the law of King Edward".|$|E

500|$|In {{the face}} of the devastation of {{smallpox}}, various smallpox gods and goddesses have been worshipped throughout parts of the Old World, for example in China and in India. In China, the smallpox goddess was referred to as T’ou-Shen Niang-Niang. Chinese believers actively worked to appease the goddess <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>for</b> her mercy, by such measures as referring to smallpox pustules as [...] "beautiful flowers" [...] as a euphemism intended to avert offending the goddess, for example (the Chinese word for smallpox is 天花, literally [...] "heaven flower"). In a related New Year's Eve custom it was prescribed that the children of the house wear ugly masks while sleeping, so as to conceal any beauty and thereby avoid attracting the goddess, who would be passing through sometime that night. If a case of smallpox did occur, shrines would be set up in the homes of the victims, to be worshipped and offered to as the disease ran its course. If the victim recovered, the shrines were removed and carried away in a special paper chair or boat for burning. If the patient did not recover, the shrine was destroyed and cursed, so as to expel the goddess from the house.|$|E
