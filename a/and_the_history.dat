5|$|Around 1917 at Mrs. Dow's School, an art {{assistant}} taught {{classes in}} drawing, painting, and modeling. In {{addition to their}} daily tasks, the students prepared monthly compositions which would be critiqued by the school's art director Frank DuMond through a lecture. Art history classes included that of Italian Renaissance painting and sculpture, Western European painting, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of Greek sculpture, architecture, and interior decoration.|$|E

5|$|The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>History</b> of Christian Science was {{published}} in November 1909 in New York by Doubleday, Page & Company.

5|$|When Sherwood's {{father died}} in 1795, her family retired from its active social life, since her mother {{preferred}} seclusion, and moved to Bridgnorth, Shropshire. At Bridgnorth Sherwood began writing sentimental novels; in 1802 she sold Margarita for £40 to Mr. Hazard of Bath, <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>History</b> of Susan Grey, a Pamela-like novel, for £10. During this time she also taught at a local Sunday school.|$|E
5|$|A major {{corrective}} opportunity {{this year}} involved the rerelease {{of one of}} the earliest malicious biographies of Mrs. Eddy, The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>History</b> of Christian Science by Georgine Milmine. Dating from the yellow journalism period, this book was published in an attempt to discredit her. The current publisher, after much correspondence with our office, instead issued a statement accurately characterizing its bias. The book has received almost no attention in the public, proving if Truth isn't spoken, nothing is said.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the {{military}} service of Hawaiians, including James Wood Bush and many others, was largely forgotten, disappearing from the collective {{memories of the}} American Civil War <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of Hawaii. However, in recent years, Hawaiian residents, historians, and descendants of Hawaiian combatants in the conflict have insisted {{on the need to}} remember the legacy of the Hawaiians who fought. Renewed interest in the stories of these individuals and this particular period of Hawaiian-American history have inspired efforts to preserve the memories of the Hawaiians who served in the war.|$|E
5|$|American football's parent {{sport of}} rugby {{continued}} to evolve. Today, two distinct codes known as rugby union and rugby league are played throughout the world. Since the two codes split following a schism {{on how the}} sport should be managed in 1895, the history of rugby league <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of rugby union have evolved separately. Both codes have adopted innovations parallel to the American game; the rugby union scoring system is almost identical to the American game, while rugby league uses a gridiron-style field and a six-tackle rule similar to the system of downs in American Football.|$|E

She also becomes a love interest for Muthu. Andrea Jeremiah, like Karthi, appears in her second major role for the film, also singing parts of two songs which appear in the soundtrack.

5|$|Djajakusuma often {{included}} traditional arts in his films, {{and two of}} them (Lahirnja Gatotkatja and Bimo Kroda) {{were based}} on traditional wayang stories and used wayang-inspired costumes and tempos. This focus on aspects of traditional culture fell out of the mainstream after 1965, having been replaced by films about city life. Djajakusuma's theatrical productions experimented with new storytelling techniques, adapting the traditional styles for the modern world. As a lecturer teaching screenwriting <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of theatre, Djajakusuma focused on Indonesian arts. He argued that Indonesians should rely on local culture, not continuously look towards the West. In other areas he was mostly apolitical.|$|E

5|$|Following {{repeated}} heavy bombing by Allied forces during Operation Crossbow, the Germans {{were unable}} to complete the construction works and the complex never entered service. It was captured by the Allies in September 1944, partially demolished on the orders of Winston Churchill to prevent its reuse as a military base, and then abandoned. It remained derelict until the mid-1990s. In 1997 it {{opened to the public}} for the first time, as a museum. Exhibits in the tunnels and under the dome {{tell the story of the}} German occupation of France during World War II, the V-weapons <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of space exploration.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Enlightenment histories, {{which have been}} seen as attempting to draw general lessons about humanity from history, the German philosopher Johann Gottfried von Herder in his Ideas upon Philosophy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>History</b> of Mankind (1784), set out the concept of Volksgeist, a unique national spirit that drove historical change. As a result, a key element in the influence of Romanticism on intellectual life was the production of national histories. The nature and existence of a national Scottish historiography has been debated among historians. Those authors who consider that such a national history did exist in this period indicate that it can be found outside of the production of major historical narratives, in works of antiquarianism and fiction.|$|E
