5|$|Maximum spacing estimators {{are also}} at least as <b>asymptotically</b> {{efficient}} as maximum likelihood estimators, where the latter exist. However, MSEs may exist in cases where MLEs do not.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the laminar {{boundary}} layer equations, the presence of two regimes governed by different sets of flow scales (i.e. {{the inner and outer}} scaling) has made finding a universal similarity solution for the turbulent {{boundary layer}} difficult and controversial. To find a similarity solution that spans both regions of the flow, it is necessary to <b>asymptotically</b> match the solutions from both regions of the flow. Such analysis will yield either the so-called log-law or power-law.|$|E
25|$|T(n) grows <b>asymptotically</b> {{as fast as}} n3.|$|E
25|$|In particular, both estimators are <b>asymptotically</b> {{efficient}} for σ2.|$|E
25|$|In reality, {{an object}} {{approaches}} its terminal velocity <b>asymptotically.</b>|$|E
25|$|An <b>asymptotically</b> {{tight bound}} in the {{analysis}} of algorithms (big O notation).|$|E
25|$|Beyond {{asymptotic}} {{order of}} growth, the constant factors matter: an <b>asymptotically</b> slower algorithm may be faster or smaller (because simpler) than an <b>asymptotically</b> faster algorithm {{when they are}} both faced with small input, {{which may be the}} case that occurs in reality. Often a hybrid algorithm will provide the best performance, due to this tradeoff changing with size.|$|E
25|$|Thus for SU(3), {{the color}} charge gauge group of QCD, {{the theory is}} <b>asymptotically</b> free if there are 16 or fewer flavors of quarks.|$|E
25|$|Although both {{mappings}} are <b>asymptotically</b> identical {{at higher}} quality values, they differ at lower quality levels (i.e., approximately p > 0.05, or equivalently, Q < 13).|$|E
25|$|Finally, one {{can find}} {{theories}} that are <b>asymptotically</b> free and reduce to the full Standard Model of electromagnetic, weak and strong forces at low enough energies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Asymptotically</b> free {{theories}} become weak at short distances, {{there is}} no Landau pole, and these quantum field theories {{are believed to be}} completely consistent down to any length scale.|$|E
25|$|Fibonacci (1170–1250) {{mentioned}} the numerical series now {{named after him}} in his Liber Abaci; the ratio of sequential elements of the Fibonacci sequence approaches the golden ratio <b>asymptotically.</b>|$|E
25|$|Consequently, the TMRCA {{estimated}} from {{a relatively}} small sample of viral genetic sequences is an <b>asymptotically</b> unbiased estimate for {{the time that the}} viral population was founded in the host population.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} spacetime {{represented}} by the above metric is <b>asymptotically</b> flat, i.e. as , the metric approaches that of the Minkowski metric and the spacetime manifold resembles that of Minkowski space.|$|E
25|$|An <b>asymptotically</b> flat spacetime is a Lorentzian {{manifold}} in which, roughly speaking, {{the curvature}} vanishes at large distances from some region, {{so that at}} large distances, the geometry becomes indistinguishable from that of Minkowski spacetime.|$|E
25|$|The {{recurrence}} is stable, {{meaning that}} the iterates converge <b>asymptotically</b> to a fixed value, {{if and only if}} the eigenvalues (i.e., the roots of the characteristic equation), whether real or complex, are all less than unity in absolute value.|$|E
25|$|When plotted on linear axes, the {{distribution}} assumes the familiar J-shaped curve which approaches {{each of the}} orthogonal axes <b>asymptotically.</b> All segments of the curve are self-similar (subject to appropriate scaling factors). When plotted in a log-log plot, {{the distribution}} is represented by a straight line.|$|E
25|$|In metric {{theories}} of gravitation such as general relativity, {{it is usually}} not possible to give general definitions of important physical concepts such as mass and angular momentum; however, assuming asympotical flatness allows one to employ convenient definitions which do make sense for <b>asymptotically</b> flat solutions.|$|E
25|$|When the {{appropriate}} conditions above are satisfied {{a system is}} said to be <b>asymptotically</b> stable; the variables of an <b>asymptotically</b> stable control system always decrease from their initial value and do not show permanent oscillations. Permanent oscillations occur when a pole has a real part exactly equal to zero (in the continuous time case) or a modulus equal to one (in the discrete time case). If a simply stable system response neither decays nor grows over time, and has no oscillations, it is marginally stable; in this case the system transfer function has non-repeated poles at the complex plane origin (i.e. their real and complex component is zero in the continuous time case). Oscillations are present when poles with real part equal to zero have an imaginary part not equal to zero.|$|E
25|$|Multigrid has the {{advantage}} of <b>asymptotically</b> optimal performance on many problems. Traditional solvers and preconditioners are effective at reducing high-frequency components of the residual, but low-frequency components typically require many iterations to reduce. By operating on multiple scales, multigrid reduces all components of the residual by similar factors, leading to a mesh-independent number of iterations.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of {{convergence in distribution}} may be extended from random vectors to more general random elements in arbitrary metric spaces, and even to the “random variables” which are not measurable — a situation which occurs for example {{in the study of}} empirical processes. This is the “weak convergence of laws without laws being defined” — except <b>asymptotically.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bubble sort also interacts poorly {{with modern}} CPU hardware. It {{produces}} {{at least twice}} as many writes as insertion sort, twice as many cache misses, and <b>asymptotically</b> more branch mispredictions. Experiments by Astrachan sorting strings in Java show bubble sort to be roughly one-fifth as fast as an insertion sort and 70% as fast as a selection sort.|$|E
25|$|The {{roots of}} this {{polynomial}} (the eigenvalues) are the system transfer function's poles (i.e., the singularities where the transfer function's magnitude is unbounded). These poles {{can be used}} to analyze whether the system is <b>asymptotically</b> stable or marginally stable. An alternative approach to determining stability, which does not involve calculating eigenvalues, is to analyze the system's Lyapunov stability.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} the fixed point, UV-attractive {{directions}} are called relevant, UV-repulsive ones irrelevant, since the corresponding scaling fields increase and decrease, respectively, when the scale is lowered. Therefore, the dimensionality of the UV critical surface equals the number of relevant couplings. An <b>asymptotically</b> safe theory is thus the more predictive the smaller is the dimensionality of the corresponding UV critical surface.|$|E
25|$|The <b>asymptotically</b> best {{efficiency}} is obtained by computing n! from its prime factorization. As documented by Peter Borwein, prime factorization allows n! to be computed in time O(n(lognbsp&nnbsp&lognbsp&lognbsp&n)2), provided that a fast multiplication algorithm is used (for example, the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm). Peter Luschny presents source code and benchmarks for several efficient factorial algorithms, {{with or without}} the use of a prime sieve.|$|E
25|$|In modern (20th century) {{theoretical}} physics, {{angular momentum}} (not including any intrinsic angular momentum – see below) is described {{using a different}} formalism, instead of a classical pseudovector. In this formalism, angular momentum is the 2-form Noether charge associated with rotational invariance. As a result, angular momentum is not conserved for general curved spacetimes, unless {{it happens to be}} <b>asymptotically</b> rotationally invariant.|$|E
25|$|Between two {{estimator}}s {{of a given}} parameter, the {{one with}} lower mean squared error {{is said to be}} more efficient. Furthermore, an estimator is said to be unbiased if its expected value is equal to the true value of the unknown parameter being estimated, and <b>asymptotically</b> unbiased if its expected value converges at the limit to the true value of such parameter.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, some {{continuous}} processes satisfy Benford's Law exactly (in the asymptotic limit as {{the process}} continues through time). One is an exponential growth or decay process: If a quantity is exponentially increasing or decreasing in time, then the percentage of time that it has each first digit satisfies Benford's Law <b>asymptotically</b> (i.e. increasing accuracy {{as the process}} continues through time).|$|E
25|$|Until the {{discovery}} of the number field sieve (NFS), QS was the <b>asymptotically</b> fastest known general-purpose factoring algorithm. Now, Lenstra elliptic curve factorization has the same asymptotic running time as QS (in the case where n has exactly two prime factors of equal size), but in practice, QS is faster since it uses single-precision operations instead of the multi-precision operations used by the elliptic curve method.|$|E
25|$|Bubble sort is <b>asymptotically</b> {{equivalent}} in running time to insertion sort {{in the worst}} case, but the two algorithms differ greatly {{in the number of}} swaps necessary. Experimental results such as those of Astrachan have also shown that insertion sort performs considerably better even on random lists. For these reasons many modern algorithm textbooks avoid using the bubble sort algorithm in favor of insertion sort.|$|E
25|$|In {{principle}} {{confidence intervals}} can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. An interval can be asymmetrical because it works as lower or upper bound for a parameter (left-sided interval or right sided interval), {{but it can}} also be asymmetrical because the two sided interval is built violating symmetry around the estimate. Sometimes the bounds for a confidence interval are reached <b>asymptotically</b> and these are used to approximate the true bounds.|$|E
25|$|The OLS {{estimator}} {{is identical}} to the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) under the normality assumption for the error terms. This normality assumption has historical importance, as it provided the basis for the early work in linear regression analysis by Yule and Pearson. From the properties of MLE, we can infer that the OLS estimator is <b>asymptotically</b> efficient (in the sense of attaining the Cramér–Rao bound for variance) if the normality assumption is satisfied.|$|E
500|$|... is <b>asymptotically</b> normal, {{and that}} a chi-squared {{approximation}} exists for small samples. In the case where we know the true parameter , [...] show that the statistic [...] has a normal distribution with ...|$|E
500|$|... for a {{lossless}} line; {{the expression}} {{for the current}} standing wave ratio (ISWR) is identical in this case. For a lossy line the expression is only valid adjacent to the termination; VSWR <b>asymptotically</b> approaches unity with distance from the termination or discontinuity.|$|E
500|$|When {{a locally}} convex self-crossing curve {{approaches}} a singularity {{as one of}} its loops shrinks, it either shrinks in a self-similar way or <b>asymptotically</b> approaches the grim reaper curve (described below) as it shrinks. When a loop collapses to a singularity, the amount of total absolute curvature that is lost is either at least 2 or exactly [...]|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} history of relativity, the {{expressions}} [...] and [...] were called longitudinal and transverse mass. Relativistic force does not produce a constant acceleration, but an ever-decreasing acceleration as the object approaches the speed of light. Note that [...] approaches <b>asymptotically</b> an infinite value and is undefined for an object with a non-zero rest mass as it approaches the speed of light, and the theory yields no prediction at that speed.|$|E
