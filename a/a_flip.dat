5|$|Bickford {{was born}} in Kentucky but raised in West Virginia. He began his {{professional}} career in 1939 and, after serving in World War II, made the majors in 1949. Acquired by the Braves organization due to <b>a</b> <b>flip</b> of a coin, Bickford {{became one of the}} most promising National League pitchers during his playing career, earning All-Star honors in 1949 and leading the National League in complete games in 1950. However his career was soon shorted by multiple arm injuries, and he was out of baseball by 1955. After working an assortment of jobs, he was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 1960 and died after a three-month illness.|$|E
5|$|The Ising {{model is}} used to model the {{behavior}} of magnetic systems. It consists of an array of cells, the state of each of which represents a spin, either up or down. The energy {{of the system is}} measured by a function that depends on the number of neighboring pairs of cells that have the same spin as each other. Therefore, if a cell has equal numbers of neighbors in the two states, it may flip its own state without changing the total energy. However, such <b>a</b> <b>flip</b> is energy-conserving only if no two adjacent cells flip at the same time.|$|E
50|$|Events are collectively {{exhaustive}} if all {{the possibilities}} for outcomes are exhausted by those possible events, so {{at least one of}} those outcomes must occur. The probability {{that at least one of}} the events will occur is equal to one. For example, there are theoretically only two possibilities for <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> coin. <b>Flipping</b> <b>a</b> head and <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> tail are collectively exhaustive events, and there is a probability of one of <b>flipping</b> either <b>a</b> head or a tail. Events can be both mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. In the case of <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> coin, <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> head and <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> tail are also mutually exclusive events. Both outcomes cannot occur for a single trial (i.e., when <b>a</b> coin is <b>flipped</b> only once). The probability of <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> head and the probability of <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> tail can be added to yield a probability of 1: 1/2 + 1/2 =1.|$|R

5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} in the Tony Hawk's series, Underground {{is centered on}} skateboarding {{in a series of}} levels. The player performs tricks via combinations of analog stick and button inputs. For example, the player initiates an ollie (a jump trick) by holding and releasing the jump button. During an ollie, the player may change the position of the analog stick and press one of two buttons to perform either <b>a</b> <b>flip</b> trick (such as an impossible or kickflip) or a grab trick (such as a benihana or nosegrab). The player can grind on certain edges and rails; different tricks may be performed during a grind based on the position of the analog stick. On quarter pipes, the player may execute lip tricks. While skating on flat surfaces, the player may manual in multiple ways via button combinations. Miscellaneous tricks include acid drops and wall-rides.|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} of singing carols in pubs around Christmas is still kept {{alive in the}} city. The Sheffield Carols, as they are known locally, predate modern carols by over a century and are sung with alternative words and verses. Although there is a core of carols that are sung at most venues, each particular place has its own mini-tradition. The repertoire at two nearby places can vary widely, and woe betide those who try to strike up a ‘foreign’ carol. Some are unaccompanied, some have a piano or organ, there is <b>a</b> <b>flip</b> chart with the words on in one place, a string quartet (quintet, sextet, septet) accompanies the singing at another, some encourage soloists, others stick to audience participation, a brass band plays at certain events, the choir takes the lead at another.

40|$|To {{meet the}} needs of the 21 st century student, college {{instructors}} have been challenged to transform their classrooms from passive to active, “minds-on ” learning environments. This qualitative study examined an active learning approach known as <b>a</b> <b>flipped</b> classroom and sought to explore student perceptions of <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> teaching methods course required in an agricultural teacher education program. Students offered mixed perceptions about this flipped class. The emergent themes included: (a) positive aspects of online lecture, (b) technological issues, (c) positive aspects of classroom learning activities, (d) negative aspects of classroom learning activities, and (e) student beliefs regarding the flipped classroom approach. Based on the findings from this study, <b>a</b> <b>flipped</b> classroom approach seems to have promise as a model for delivering a teaching methods class. As a result, we suggest other instructors of similar courses attempt <b>a</b> <b>flipped</b> classroom approach to test the model in other contexts...|$|R

25|$|From the {{description}} {{in terms of}} independent tosses, the statistics of the model for long lines can be understood. The line splits into domains. Each domain is of average length exp(2β). The length of a domain is distributed exponentially, since {{there is a constant}} probability at any step of encountering <b>a</b> <b>flip.</b> The domains never become infinite, so a long system is never magnetized. Each step reduces the correlation between a spin and its neighbor by an amount proportional to p, so the correlations fall off exponentially.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 Crick {{addressed}} {{the origin of}} protein synthesis in a paper with Sydney Brenner, Aaron Klug, and George Pieczenik. In this paper, they speculate that code constraints on nucleotide sequences allow protein synthesis {{without the need for}} a ribosome. It, however, requires a five base binding between the mRNA and tRNA with <b>a</b> <b>flip</b> of the anti-codon creating a triplet coding, even though it is a five-base physical interaction. Thomas H. Jukes pointed out that the code constraints on the mRNA sequence required for this translation mechanism is still preserved.|$|E
40|$|Purpose This study explores how {{to design}} <b>a</b> <b>flipped</b> {{classroom}} for <b>a</b> predental science course and evaluate its course through student self-assessment {{in order to}} provide practical implications for <b>flipped</b> learning in <b>an</b> undergraduate level. Methods Second- and third-year predental students in the Seoul National University School of Dentistry enrolled in Biodiversity and Global Environment, a 15 -week, three-credit course based on <b>a</b> <b>flipped</b> learning model. At the end of the course, the students were asked to rate their self-directed learning, attitude toward social media, discussion skills, learning readiness, and class satisfaction. Out of the 82 predental students, 61 (74. 3 %) answered the survey. Pearson correlation and multivariate regression analyses were employed {{to examine the relationship between}} the self-rated measurements and the performance scores. Results The majority of the students felt somewhat more prepared than the medium level before the class (mean score of 3. 17 out of 5. 00), whereas they expressed relatively low preference concerning social media use and attitude (mean score of 2. 49). Thus, it was found that learning readiness was significantly associated with both discussion skills and class satisfaction. In particular, multivariate regression analysis confirmed that learning readiness had a significant influence on learning outcomes. Conclusion This study offered insights into how to design <b>a</b> <b>flipped</b> learning course in terms of predental students’ preference and their learning readiness. Although learning success in <b>a</b> <b>flipped</b> classroom depends on the students’ self-perceived level of preparedness, much still remains to be achieved in order to apply social media benefits in <b>a</b> <b>flipped</b> learning context...|$|R

The growing trend of {{technology}} {{integration in the}} classroom and the emphasis on individualized learning are brought together in this paper on the effects of <b>a</b> <b>flipped</b> classroom on student learning and attitudes in social studies. Little research has been done to explore the potential academic benefits and attitude improvements when implementing <b>a</b> <b>flipped</b> classroom in <b>a</b> middle school setting. Through an action research project conducted in a seventh grade social studies classroom, this study looks at the differences between <b>a</b> <b>flipped</b> classroom and <b>a</b> traditional classroom structure over the course of two units. Ninety-nine students were involved in this study with two sections of students taught utilizing traditional methods while their counterparts learned in <b>a</b> <b>flipped</b> setting. The groups were then switched for the second unit of this study so all students were exposed to both the traditional and the flipped design. Pre- and post-unit tests and surveys were used to determine differences between the instructional experiences in regards to both learning and attitudes. The concluding data from this action research project did not show major differences between the flipped and traditional sections in either student learning or attitudes...|$|R
25|$|In {{studying}} coin flipping, {{to observe}} the rotation speed of coin flips, Diaconis first used a strobe light and a coin with one side painted black, the other white, {{so that when the}} speed of the strobe flash equaled the rotation rate of the coin, it would appear to always show the same side. This proved difficult to use, and rotation rate was more accurately computed by attaching floss to a coin, such that it would wind around the coin – after <b>a</b> <b>flip,</b> one could count rotations by unwinding the floss, and then compute rotation rate as flips over air time.|$|E
