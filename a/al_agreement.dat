40|$|The {{emissivity}} for the neutrino pair {{synchrotron radiation}} in strong magnetic fields has been calculated both analytically and numerically for high densities and moderate temperatures, {{as can be}} found in neutron stars. Under these conditions, the electrons are relativistic and degenerate. We give here our results in terms of a universal function of a single variable. For two different regimes of the electron gas we present a simplified calculation and compare our results to those of Kaminker et <b>al.</b> <b>Agreement</b> is found for the classical region, where many Landau levels contribute to the emissivity, but some differences arise in the quantum regime. One finds that the emissivity for neutrino pair synchrotron radiation is competitive with and can dominate, other neutrino processes for magnetic fields of the order B similar to 10 (14) - 10 (15) G.

40|$|Stein's {{model for}} a neuron {{receiving}} randomly arriving post-synaptic potentials is studied from an analytic viewpoint, using some recent results {{in the theory of}} first passage times for temporally homogeneous Markov processes. The case when the only input is excitatory can be treated exactly. It is shown that the moments of the firing time are guaranteed tobe finite so that the differential-difference equation for the expectation (and higher moments) of the time for the membrane potential to first reach threshold from resting level can be written down. Analytic solutions are obtained in a number of cases with main emphasis on the case when the threshold is twice the epsp magnitude. An invariance principle is formulated wherein at a given mean input frequency and for a given decay parameter, the distribution of firing times depends only on the ratio of threshold to epsp magnitude. For the case where this ratio is two, the variation in the mean discharge rate is obtained as a function of mean input frequency. The results are compared with the experimental data for the Poisson mono-synaptic excitation of cat motoneurons by Redman et <b>al.</b> <b>Agreement</b> between theoretical nd experimental values is excellent at input frequencies near 102 sec-~, and theory underestimates he firing rate below that input frequency. Reasons for the discrepancy are discussed at length including the uncertainties in the neuronal parameters and the dependence of epsp magnitude on mean input frequency. The problem of including an inhibitory input process together with excitation is treated by an approximation procedure when the inhibition is considerably weaker than the excitation. At the input frequency investigated it is shown that when inhibition "half as weak " as the excitation occurs, the mean discharge frequency isapproximately halved. In the final section amethod of estimating neuronal parameters from the moments of the experi-mental inter-spike time distribution isoutlined. 1...|$|E

40|$|TO THE EDITOR: We {{are writing}} {{with regard to}} the study by Chacko et al. (3). Although we commend Dr. Haymond’s team for {{addressing}} a difficult and important problem, the concept of using an “average ” label incorporation requires additional consideration. We are concerned about whether the hydrogen/ deuterium bound to carbon 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of glucose exchange equally during gluconeogenesis, as required for the validity of this method (3), especially since nongluconeogenic exchange reactions and/or kinetic isotope effects influence these sites differently (4, 9 – 11). Although Chacko et <b>al.</b> found <b>agreement</b> between the hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) method and their “average method ” (implying equal exchange in the various positions), the limited range of physiological condi-tions is understated (3).
