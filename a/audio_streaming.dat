5|$|The {{definition}} of a million-selling single, as regarded by the Official Charts Company (OCC), has changed in line with new technology for music consumption. Originally only physical record sales were counted {{since the start of}} the UK Singles Chart in November 1952. Digital downloads of a track were included from 2004 onwards and from 2014 onwards BPI-certified awards (Silver, Gold and Platinum) and the weekly charts include <b>audio</b> <b>streaming.</b> In 2017, the OCC included streaming in their {{definition of}} a million-seller and published a full list of the 311 songs which had achieved this. Certified awards can also include shipments (sales to trade). The OCC and Music Week regularly announce when a record becomes a million seller.|$|E

The identification is robust to signal delays of up to several seconds {{as well as to}} signal distortions due to lossy coding, a noisy environment, or analog transmission. An area of application is the query-bymobile -phone scenario where a user transmits an <b>audio</b> <b>stream</b> recorded from the radio using his mobile phone as a recording device. The transmitted <b>audio</b> <b>stream</b> may be identified using the proposed system. For this, the system matches a compressed version of the stream to compressed versions all possible radio programmes in real-time...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{provided}} for forming cross-fades between audio files, which includes providing {{a plurality of}} audio files, each audio file comprising a plurality of respective <b>audio</b> <b>streams</b> pertaining to a single song, and providing a library of different fades, wherein each fade defines a respective characteristic shape of change in playback level over time to fade-in or fade-out an <b>audio</b> <b>stream.</b> The method further includes associating a respective fade, selected from the library of fades, with each <b>audio</b> <b>stream,</b> such that a cross-fade from a first one of the audio files to a second one of the audio files can be formed by applying the respective fades of the <b>audio</b> <b>streams</b> of the first audio file to fade-out the first audio file, and simultaneously applying the respective fades of the <b>audio</b> <b>streams</b> of the second audio file to fade-in the second audio file. These fades might be placed intelligently through real-time analysis of the plurality of <b>audio</b> <b>streams</b> and matching of musical features such as harmony.
