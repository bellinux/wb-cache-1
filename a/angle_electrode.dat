40|$|Dielectric barrier {{discharge}} (DBD) plasma actuators induce an ionic {{wind that}} imparts momentum {{to the surrounding}} air, resulting in a net response force being produced. The upstream ionic wind is drawn inwards from above the actuator before being directed downstream parallel to the dielectric plate. Varying the <b>angle</b> between the <b>electrodes</b> in a DBD plasma actuator changes the magnitude {{and direction of the}} resultant response force. Increasing the angle results in a higher achieved response force. It is hypothesised that changing the <b>angle</b> between the <b>electrodes</b> alters the direction of the upstream and downstream components of the ionic wind. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) has been used to determine the flow directions of the ionic wind for various <b>electrode</b> <b>angles</b> in a DBD actuator.

40|$|Several {{experiments}} {{concerning the}} maximum arc length {{were carried out}} as the basic research for {{the stability of the}} electric arc in welding. In this paper we describe an experimental study of the variation of the maximum arc length under windy conditions. A summary of the results is shown below. (1) Under the windless conditions the maximum arc length, while the <b>angle</b> of <b>electrode</b> is not changed, increases nearly in proportion to the electric current. As the wind velocity increases the maximum arc length decreases as a whole and the whole value evidently tends to be constant independently of the current. (2) When the <b>angle</b> of <b>electrode</b> is changed under the windless condition the maximum arc length comes to be the largest at 90 °angle of electrode, but in the wind velocity of 4 m/sec or 9 m/sec it comes to be the largest at about 45 °angle There is not very great change in the value of L_(θ) /L_(π/ 2), where L_(θ) means the maximun arc length at θ°and L_(π/ 2) means the maximum arc length at 90 °angle of electrode, independently of the current and the angle is only relevant to the value under both of the previous atmospheric conditions. (4) In the constant current the arc angle is dependent on the <b>angle</b> of <b>electrode</b> and as the wind velocity increases it is not affected very much at 45 °angle of electrode, but beyond 45 °angle the tendency is recognizably clear that the arc angle increases in addition to the wind velocity...|$|R
25|$|Undercutting is {{when the}} weld reduces the {{cross-sectional}} thickness of the base metal. This type of defect reduces {{the strength of the}} weld and workpieces. One reason for this defect is excessive current, causing the edges of the joint to melt and drain into the weld; this leaves a drain-like impression {{along the length of the}} weld. Another reason is if a poor technique is used that does not deposit enough filler metal along the edges of the weld. A third reason is using an incorrect filler metal, because it will create greater temperature gradients between the center of the weld and the edges. Other causes include too small of an <b>electrode</b> <b>angle,</b> a dampened <b>electrode,</b> excessive arc length, and slow speed.|$|R
50|$|Lack of fusion is {{the poor}} {{adhesion}} of the weld bead {{to the base}} metal; incomplete penetration is a weld bead that does not start {{at the root of}} the weld groove. Incomplete penetration forms channels and crevices in the root of the weld which can cause serious issues in pipes because corrosive substances can settle in these areas. These types of defects occur when the welding procedures are not adhered to; possible causes include the current setting, arc length, <b>electrode</b> <b>angle,</b> and <b>electrode</b> manipulation. Defects can be varied and classified as critical or non critical. Porosity (bubbles) in the weld are usually acceptable to a certain degree. Slag inclusions, undercut, and cracks are usually unacceptable. Some porosity, cracks, and slag inclusions are visible and may not need further inspection to require their removal. Small defects such as these can be verified by Liquid Penetrant Testing (Dye check). Slag inclusions and cracks just below the surface can be discovered by Magnetic Particle Inspection. Deeper defects can be detected using the Radiographic (X-rays) and/or Ultrasound (sound waves) testing techniques.|$|R

Layer 4 B, which does not receive a direct thalamic input, contains orientationally selective cells, {{and many of these}} are also direction selective.

With regard to the precision of retinotopic mapping that is seen in lamina 4 C, it is noteworthy that there is substantial overlap among the minimum response fields of neighboring neurons.

40|$|Liquid rocket engines {{extensively}} use spark-initiated torch igniters for ignition. As {{the focus}} shifts to longer missions that require multiple starts {{of the main}} engines, there exists a need to solve the significant problems associated with using spark-initiated devices. Improving the fundamental understanding of predicting the required breakdown voltage in rocket environments along with reducing electrical noise is necessary to ensure that missions can be completed successfully. To better understand spark ignition systems {{and add to the}} fundamental research on spark development in rocket applications, several parameter categories of interest were hypothesized to affect breakdown voltage: (i) fluid, (ii) electrode, and (iii) electrical. The fluid properties varied were pressure, temperature, density and mass flow rate. Electrode materials, insert <b>electrode</b> <b>angle</b> and spark gap distance were the electrode properties varied. Polarity was the electrical property investigated. Testing how breakdown voltage is affected by each parameter was conducted using three different isolated insert electrodes fabricated from copper and nickel. A spark plug commonly used in torch igniters was the other electrode. A continuous output power source connected to a large impedance source and capacitance provided the pulsing potential. Temperature, pressure and high voltage measurements were recorded for the 418 tests that were successfully completed. Nitrogen, being inert and similar to oxygen, a propellant widely used in torch igniters, was used as the fluid for the majority of testing. There were 68 tests completed with oxygen and 45 with helium. A regression of the nitrogen data produced a correction coefficient to Paschen’s Law that predicts the breakdown voltage to within 3000 volts, better than 20 %, compared to an over prediction on the order of 100, 000 volts using Paschen’s Law. The correction coefficient is based on the parameters most influencing breakdown voltage: fluid density, spark gap distance, <b>electrode</b> <b>angles,</b> <b>electrode</b> materials and polarity. The research added to the fundamental knowledge of spark development in rocket ignition applications by determining the parameters that most influence breakdown voltage. Some improvements to the research should include better temperature measurements near the spark gap, additional testing with oxygen and testing with fuels of interest such as hydrogen and methane. ...|$|R

These peaks are {{traced back to}} a buildup of a magnetic moment on the impurity due to the electrodes spin polarization. For a large mutual <b>angle</b> of the <b>electrodes</b> magnetization directions, the two resonant peaks approach each others and merge into a single peak for antiparallel orientation of the electrodes magnetizations. We {{point out that the}} tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) may change sign for relatively small changes in the values of the polarization parameters. Furthermore, we inspect the behaviour of the differential conductance and TMR upon varying the temperature. Comment: 8 pages, 7 figures, accepted by Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} of curved hole {{processing}} for cooling jackets of metal molds is proposed. This machining technique {{is characterized by}} a self-processing electrode capable of following the shape of the curved hole to be machined. This paper describes a design optimization of tool structure in the electrochemical curved holes machining method and the result of machining experiments. The curvature of the hole can be determined by the tilt <b>angle</b> of the <b>electrode</b> tip attached {{to the end of the}} tool. The tool design was optimized by a numerical analysis of the electrostatic field in the working gap to simplify the tool structure and to obtain a machining stability. The tool for small hole newly developed has a simple structure composed of a flexible tube and cylindrical electrode tip. Machining tests showed that short circuiting can be avoided and that the calculated removal volume distribution agreed with the form of holes obtained from the experiment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} general {{applicable}} algorithm for the optimization {{of the current}} density distribution in the electrochemical cells using the insulating shields during the electroplating process. The innovative aspect is that {{the position of the}} insulating shield is displaced over a number of predefined time steps convecting its surface proportional with and {{in the direction of a}} well chosen rate provided by a genetic algorithm. The aim of this method is to develop a systematic modification of the insulating shield position in order to get a more uniform distribution of the current density, hence a more uniform deposited layer at the cathode. As the displacement of the insulating shield is performed with the Level Set Method, the re-meshing of the computational domain with finite elements is not required anymore. Finally an example related to the optimization of the current density distribution in the vicinity of a singularity (incident <b>angle</b> between the <b>electrode</b> and insulator = 180 °), using an insulating shield, will be presented...|$|R
