5|$|In the Sandleford warren, Fiver, a young runt rabbit {{who is a}} seer, {{receives}} <b>a</b> <b>frightening</b> {{vision of}} his warren's imminent destruction. When {{he and his brother}} Hazel fail to convince their chief rabbit of the need to evacuate, they set out on their own, accompanied by nine other rabbits who choose to go with them. The first challenge in the small band's search for a new home comes immediately, as they are forced to elude the Owsla, the warren's military caste.|$|E
5|$|Scholar M. Daphne Kutzer {{points out}} that Mr. McGregor's role is larger in The Flopsy Bunnies than in the two {{previous}} rabbit books, but he inspires less fear in The Flopsy Bunnies than in Peter Rabbit because his role as fearsome antagonist is diminished when he becomes a comic foil in the book's final scenes. Nonetheless, for young readers, he is still <b>a</b> <b>frightening</b> figure because he has captured not only vulnerable sleeping bunnies but bunnies whose parents have failed to adequately protect them.|$|E

5|$|The Hickmans {{began work}} on Ravenloft in the late 1970s, intent on {{creating}} <b>a</b> <b>frightening</b> portrait of a vampire in a setting that combined Gothic horror with the D game system. They play-tested the adventure {{with a group of}} players each Halloween for five years before it was published. Strahd has since appeared in a number of D accessories and novels. The module has inspired numerous revisions and adaptations, including a campaign setting of the same name and a sequel. In 1999, on the 25th anniversary of Dungeons & Dragons, two commemorative versions of Ravenloft were released.|$|E
5|$|Tracy Hickman and Laura Curtis {{married in}} 1977. Soon after, {{while living in}} Provo, Utah, they wrote the adventures Pharaoh and Ravenloft. When they began work on Ravenloft, they felt the vampire {{archetype}} had become overused, trite, and mundane, and decided to create <b>a</b> <b>frightening</b> version of the creature for the module. They play-tested it {{with a group of}} players every Halloween for five years before it was published in 1983 by TSR. The plot combined elements of the horror genre with Dungeons & Dragons conventions for the first time. At the time of Ravenlofts release, each Dungeons & Dragons module was marked with an alphanumeric code indicating the series to which it belonged. Ravenloft was labeled I6: the sixth in a series of intermediate-level modules for the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD). It consisted of a 32-page book, with separate maps that detailed locations in the adventure scenario.|$|E

25|$|Lou was <b>a</b> <b>frightening</b> matriarch who domineered {{over both}} the Beale and Fowler {{families}} {{and most of}} her neighbours in Walford as well. The character did have a softer side, most often seen when interacting with her grandchildren. She was depicted as the linchpin of the Walford community and was often first to rally around her neighbours in times of trouble, or instruct various members of her clan {{to do so in}} her stead.|$|E
25|$|La Grande Illusion, a 1937 film by Jean Renoir, {{depicts the}} story of two French {{officers}} of the First World War sent to a prisoners’ camp in Germany. They decide to escape by digging a tunnel in perilous conditions. After several aborted escape attempts and repeated transfers, they are placed in a mountain fortress. The story does not portray negative characters: soldiers or guards, the Germans are good guys, while the Allied prisoners perform their duties conscientiously but without excessive heroism. As shown, the prisoners’ camps of 1914-18 do not give the impression of <b>a</b> <b>frightening</b> inferno (at least the officers’ camps).|$|E

25|$|On February 16, 1970, Frazier faced WBA Champion Jimmy Ellis at Madison Square Garden. Ellis had outpointed Jerry Quarry in {{the final}} bout of the WBA {{elimination}} tournament for Ali's vacated belt. Frazier had himself declined {{to participate in the}} WBA tournament to protest their decision to strip Ali. Ellis held an impressive win over Oscar Bonavena among others. Beforehand, Ali had announced his retirement and relinquished the Heavyweight title, allowing Ellis and Frazier to fight for the undisputed title. Frazier won by a TKO when Ellis's trainer Angelo Dundee would not let him come out for the 5th round following two 4th round knockdowns (the first knockdowns of Ellis's career). Frazier's decisive win over Ellis was <b>a</b> <b>frightening</b> display of power and tenacity.|$|E
25|$|On {{the surface}} of the west face of the {{pedestal}} and from left to right we first see the devil himself, <b>a</b> <b>frightening</b> figure. He is trying to tempt Jesus who is appearing before Pontius Pilate. Next, we are shown the resurrected Christ who has emerged from the tomb. Here the date 1604 is inscribed. Next, we see the young Jesus engaged in discussions with the two lawyers. Then Jesus is shown holding the hands of two lost souls who he has rescued from the open mouth of hell ("Abandon all hope ye who enter here") from which flames emerge and other lost souls writhe in agony, including the legendary Kattell Gollet. A demon sits above the mouth orchestrating proceedings and another with horns is with the others in the mouth itself.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} Jacksons' disappearance, a local couple {{came forward to}} report that they had had <b>a</b> <b>frightening</b> {{experience}} with a tall, darked-haired man that same afternoon. The man had driven behind and around them in a blue, older-model Chevrolet, flashing his headlights and forcing them off the road. The man later {{got out of his}} car and menacingly approached the couple; sensing danger, they reversed and managed to flee the scene. After Mildred and Susan Jackson's bodies were found, detectives discovered an abandoned building near their dump site—reportedly the same cinderblock structure that had been searched after Margaret Harold's killing. Inside, they found a red button missing from Mildred's dress, indicating that she had been taken there after being kidnapped. Near the building were fresh tire marks. After finding points of comparison between the Harold and Jackson cases—mainly the general area of the murders and the sadistic nature of the crimes—investigators determined that both homicides were committed by the same culprit.|$|E

25|$|His work pleased {{the board}} and they {{assigned}} him to paint frescoes in the large lunettes of {{the walls of the}} chapel. Work began in 1500 and was completed in 1503. (There was a break in 1502 because funds were lacking.) These frescoes in the chapel are considered the most complex and impressive work by Signorelli. He and his school spent two years creating a series of frescoes concerning the Apocalypse and the Last Judgment, starting with the Preaching of the Antichrist, continuing with tumultuous episodes of the End of the World, finding a counterpart in the Resurrection of the Flesh. The fourth scene is <b>a</b> <b>frightening</b> depiction of the Damned taken to Hell and received by Demons. On the wall behind the altar, Signorelli depicts on the left side the Elect being led to Paradise and on the right side the Reprobates driven to Hell. He added to these expressive scenes some striking details.|$|E
25|$|Fear can {{be learned}} by {{experiencing}} or watching <b>a</b> <b>frightening</b> traumatic accident. For example, if a child falls into a well and struggles to get out, {{he or she may}} develop a fear of wells, heights (acrophobia), enclosed spaces (claustrophobia), or water (aquaphobia). There are studies looking at areas of the brain that are affected in relation to fear. When looking at these areas (such as the amygdala), it was proposed that a person learns to fear regardless of whether they themselves have experienced trauma, or if they have observed the fear in others. In a study completed by Andreas Olsson, Katherine I. Nearing and Elizabeth A. Phelps the amygdala were affected both when subjects observed someone else being submitted to an aversive event, knowing that the same treatment awaited themselves, and when subjects were subsequently placed in a fear-provoking situation. This suggests that fear can develop in both conditions, not just simply from personal history.|$|E
25|$|The {{group of}} gorillas {{is led by}} one or more adult males. In cases where there are more than one silverback males in a group, they are most likely father and son. Groups {{containing}} only one male are believed to be the basic unit of the social group, gradually growing in size due to reproduction and new members migrating in. In the study done at Lope, gorillas harvest most of their food arboreally, but less than half of their night nests are built in trees. They are often found on the ground and are made up of up to 30 gorillas. Western lowland gorillas live in the smallest family groups of all gorillas, with an average of 4 to 8 members in each. The leader (the silverback) organizes group activities, like eating, nesting and travelling in their home range. Those who challenge this alpha male are apt to be cowed by impressive shows of physical power. He may stand upright, throw things, make aggressive charges, and pound his huge chest while barking out powerful hoots or unleashing <b>a</b> <b>frightening</b> roar. Despite these displays and the animals' obvious physical power, gorillas are generally calm and nonaggressive unless they are disturbed. Young gorillas, from three to six years old, remind human observers of children. Much of their day is spent in play, climbing trees, chasing one another and swinging from branches.|$|E
