5|$|Like {{most members}} of Congress during the Era of Good Feelings, Senator Edwards sat {{as a member of}} the Democratic-Republican Party. As his second term drew on, he joined the Adams-Clay faction that would develop into the National Republicans after Edwards left office. Edwards voted for the Missouri Compromise in 1820, a bill that Thomas sponsored. He voted against a law {{reducing}} prices for federal land, which made both Edwards and Representative Daniel Pope Cook targets of criticism <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> <b>On</b> May 6, 1821, Cook married Edwards' daughter Julia.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Sheffield United's {{third round}} match at Burnley {{ended in a}} 0–0 draw, before winning 2–1 in the replay <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>on</b> a snow-covered pitch {{in a game that}} was marred by heavy fog at the start. Harold Barton scored for United, before Ted Hancock {{equalized}} for Burnley. Bobby Barclay scored United's second goal before the break. An additional goal by Jock Dodds for United was disallowed in the second half due to the player being ruled offside.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt by the}} defence to {{question}} the court's jurisdiction, several witnesses were questioned {{over a period of}} several weeks, including Udin's neighbours and wife, as well as Sudarmo's nephew. The hearings, which were held on Mondays and Thursdays, were filled with spectators. At the trial, the defence suggested that a government conspiracy may have been responsible, but were told by the tribunal to focus on the case at hand. Further witnesses, including a key witness for the prosecution, came across as unconvincing; they also changed their stories, reneging statements which they had made before the trial. Other witnesses for the prosecution, including several of Sumaji's neighbours, testified that the driver could not have committed the murder because he was <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>on</b> the night of 13 August. Another said that the steel pipe said to be the murder weapon in court was different from that found with Udin's blood on it.|$|E

5|$|After his accident, Kurosawa's health {{began to}} deteriorate. While his mind {{remained}} sharp and lively, {{his body was}} giving up, {{and for the last}} half-year of his life, the director was largely confined to bed, listening to music and watching television <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> <b>On</b> September 6, 1998, Kurosawa died of a stroke in Setagaya, Tokyo, at the age of 88. At the time of his death, Kurosawa had two children, his son Hisao Kurosawa who married Hiroko Hayashi and his daughter Kazuko Kurosawa who married Harayuki Kato, along with several grandchildren. One of his grandchildren, the actor Takayuki Kato and , became a supporting actor in two films posthumously developed from screenplays written by Kurosawa which remained unproduced during his own lifetime, Takashi Koizumi's After the Rain (1999) and Kei Kumai's The Sea is Watching (2002).|$|E
5|$|Duquesne enjoyed {{another game}} <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>on</b> February 14 against the La Salle Explorers. Ron Everhart sought a new {{strategy}} for his team, which was struggling in conference play. In this game, La Salle was missing three players, leaving them with an active roster of only eight players. Duquesne ran a 10–40 pattern, in which two squads of five players execute short, intense bursts before being switched out for the other squad. At first, Duquesne fell behind by 14points, but the strategy paid off as La Salle's players tired. With La Salle fatigued, Duquesne switched back to a normal rotation {{and went on to}} win 103–82. Bill Clark scored a career high 34points, and also surpassed the 1,000point mark.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{resignation}} in 1926 to allow Margaret Bondfield {{to take a}} seat in Parliament, Hastings returned to {{his work as a}} barrister, and was even more successful than before his entry into the House of Commons. His cases included the Savidge Inquiry and the Royal Mail Case, and before his full retirement in 1948 {{he was one of the}} highest paid barristers at the English Bar. As well as his legal work, Hastings also tried his hand at writing plays. Although these had a mixed reception, The River was made into a silent film in 1927 named The Notorious Lady. Following strokes in 1948 and 1949, his activities became heavily restricted, and he died <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>on</b> 26 February 1952.|$|E

5|$|Having been {{disappointed}} by the new contract offered to him by Tamworth, Smith agreed on 25 May 2010 to join fellow Conference Premier team Mansfield Town on a one-year contract. He made his debut in a 3–1 home victory over Forest Green on 14 August 2010, {{the opening day of}} 2010–11, and his first goal came from a close range header as Mansfield beat Eastbourne Borough 4–0 <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>on</b> 25 September.

5|$|John Stainer was {{the eighth}} of nine {{children}} born to William Stainer and his wife Ann (née Collier) on 6 June 1840. At least three of the children died in infancy, and John was much younger than his brother, William, and his three sisters, Ann, Sarah and Mary. The family lived in Southwark, London, where {{his father was a}} cabinet maker and later a vestry clerk and registrar of births. He was also an untaught musician and player of the piano, violin and flute. He built a small chamber organ <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>on</b> which the precocious John used to accompany him when he played hymn tunes on the violin. His sister Ann also used it – she was the regular organist at Magdalen Hospital, Streatham. It was a happy family, and young John seems to have been spoiled by his elders. He was precocious and could play Bach's Fugue in E major at the age of seven.|$|E
5|$|Keene died <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>on</b> January 13, 2009, aged 85, from a {{respiratory}} condition. After her death, the Homer {{city council}} passed a new resolution banning the feeding of eagles, crows, ravens and other predatory and scavenger birds by any person, effective March 19, 2009. The resolution's effective date was delayed until spring {{out of concern}} that the birds would either die of starvation or become highly aggressive if the feeding ended {{in the middle of}} winter. A memorial to Keene is planned at a nearby hotel that was a favorite dining spot of Keene's and supplied much of her fish.|$|E
