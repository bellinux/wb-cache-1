25|$|One ambitious noble named Paul, {{who thought}} it would be <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> take the throne from an old man who had shown so plainly {{that he did not want}} it, rose in rebellion. He soon learned his mistake. Wamba met him in battle, routed his army, and took him prisoner. Paul {{expected}} nothing less than to have his head stricken off, but Wamba simply ordered that it should be shaved.|$|E
25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E
500|$|Neither United nor Arsenal made {{noticeable}} {{changes to}} their squad, but Ferguson believed both teams would remain {{the ones to}} beat in the Premier League: [...] "There's only really ourselves and Arsenal who {{know what it takes}} to win the Premiership. It's not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> achieve. You need experience." ...|$|E
5000|$|Molly Ringwald - {{the theme}} song for The Secret Life of the American Teenager from 2008-2012, in which Ringwald also stars as Anne Juergens. Ringwald's {{rendition}} is upbeat containing such lines as [...] "Falling in love is such <b>a</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do. Birds can do it, we can do it. Let's stop talking, let's get to it. Let's fall in love." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It aint <b>a</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{say what}} they ought to do, much less what they will do; it aint a good outlook anyway, and I don't know what I should do myself. The whole of the woods {{on this side of the}} lake are full of the darned red critters. There's a hundred eyes on that canoe now, and, go where they will, they'll be watched." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you won't join that symposium?" [...] said B-----. [...] "It {{would be}} <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> enough <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> knock off--'Why Christmas should be abolished.'" ...|$|R
500|$|A {{possible}} {{venue for}} re-release {{of the games}} would be computer game sale and distribution service GOG.com. In an interview with GOG.com's Trevor Longino, he said that [...] "NOLF is a really great title, and it's {{one of the ones}} where the rights are a bear to get sorted. Just like pretty much any other classic IP you're ever thought of, we’ve looked into it, but it’s not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{receiving}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} the critics, the country-rock style of Sweetheart of the Rodeo {{was such a}} radical departure from the band's previous sound that large sections of the group's counterculture following were alienated by its contents, resulting in the lowest sales of any Byrds album up to that point. Barry Gifford, in the August 1968 edition of Rolling Stone magazine, said of the album: [...] "The new Byrds do not sound like Buck Owens & his Buckaroos. They aren't that good. The material they've chosen to record, or rather, the way they perform the material, is simple, relaxed and folky. It's not pretentious, it's pretty. The musician-ship is excellent." [...] Gifford added that [...] "The Byrds have made an interesting album. It's really very uninvolved and not a difficult record to listen to. It ought to make the 'Easy-Listening' charts. 'Bringing it all back home' has never been <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Rolling Stone praised the album in its September 1968 issue, with Jon Landau writing: [...] "The Byrds, in doing country as country, show just how powerful and relevant unadorned country music is to the music of today." [...] Landau added that [...] "they leave just enough rock in the drums {{to let you know that}} they can still play rock & roll." [...] In a 1969 article for The New York Times, Robert Christgau described Sweetheart of the Rodeo as [...] "a bittersweet tribute to country music".|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{felt that}} Budig brought a special mix of qualities to the table, {{detailing}} that [...] "she has this unique way {{of playing the}} bad girl, if you will, but making her very likable". Wilson elaborated on Budig's way of showing vulnerability: [...] "You love to watch this bad girl, and that's not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> make people do. As a person, Rebecca has this wonderful kind of spunky, upbeat quality that is endearing. I've always liked this girl, and enjoyed spending time with her. She's {{just a lot of}} fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not as yet. Her Majesty {{has seen}} both Mr. Gresham and Mr. Daubeny {{as well as}} myself. It does not seem <b>a</b> very <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> make <b>a</b> Ministry just at present." ...|$|R
2500|$|Daly {{was raised}} in a deeply {{religious}} family in the farming communities of Wellington, Ohio and Oberlin, Ohio. He has been quoted as saying that his artistic personality made him a misfit. [...] "I want something that I believe in and I almost want to be frightened by what I'm doing. If I'm not frightened, I don't know if it's even good enough or worth it. I could go back and work at the gas station or farm in Ohio. That would be <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] said I, [...] "it's {{not exactly}} private, but it's not <b>a</b> very <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> put {{straight}} before anybody, {{and if it}} don't make any difference, we'd rather not have to tell it twice." ...|$|R
2500|$|Newsted {{has stated}} {{that he has never}} regretted leaving the band. In a 2009 interview, he said [...] "I tell you very honestly, one billion percent, I have never regretted leaving Metallica. It was the right thing for everyone. It {{was the right thing to}} do for the camp. That's it. I've never told anyone that I wanted to go back or {{anything}} like that—not once. I made up my mind. It was not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do, but it was something I had to do. I thought about it very much before I pulled the trigger and because of that, I have never looked back. The past is where it's supposed to be." [...] It was mentioned in the film Some Kind of Monster that there was a rumor that Newsted would possibly rejoin the band, but it was proven false.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pish!" [...] snapped Marius, too {{angered by}} the {{reflection}} cast upon his address, to be flattered by their praises of his beauty. [...] "It is <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> talk; <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> set up arguments when we consider but the half of a question. You forget, madame, that Valerie is betrothed to Florimond and that she clings faithfully to her betrothal." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{it was not}} <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> find a canal-boat. There {{were none}} advertised for rent--at least, not for {{housekeeping}} purposes.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, Saari {{provided}} {{further insight}} into {{his decision to}} leave Flip, citing the death of former teammate Shane Cross as a significant underpinning factor: [...] "It wasn't, like, <b>a</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do, but, at the time, I knew I {{had to do it}} ... for the reasons that happened, you know? And that's why I decided that it's better off for me to leave Flip than, just, go my own way and, just, do that." [...] Professional skateboarder Ed Templeton stated in a 2012 interview: [...] "I mean I was completely shocked when he left Flip ... it didn't make sense." ...|$|R
60|$|Gilbert did {{not find}} it <b>a</b> very <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> bring Una back to consciousness. He worked over {{her for a long}} time before her eyes opened. Then he carried her over to the manse, {{followed}} by Faith, sobbing hysterically in her relief.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, I {{have heard}} that they are {{stronger}} than ordinary; and so they need be, seeing {{that you have a}} blood feud with the Bairds. Well, they are not like to have much time to waste over it, for our sheriff has already sent word here, as to the places where we are to gather when the beacon fires are lighted; and you may be sure that the Percys will lose no time in marching against them, with all their array; and the Scots are like to find, as they have found before, that it is <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> cross the border than it is to get back." ...|$|R
60|$|With an army {{at their}} call, it were <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> take a lone man, {{even though that}} man were the Devil of Torn.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] was the reply, [...] "each of us rules himself, or {{at least}} tries to do so. It is not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do, as you {{probably}} know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll find it <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> carry," [...] {{said his}} uncle. [...] "Try it," [...] and Randy did so, and was {{astonished}} to learn how much the head-strap improved the carrying powers.|$|E
60|$|Valentine {{hesitated a}} little. The breeze was {{moderately}} fresh and the Sorata traveling fast enough, {{while it is}} not <b>a</b> very <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> steer <b>a</b> craft running under the great three-cornered sail, which is apt to swing over in case of a blunder at the tiller.|$|R
60|$|For {{the rest}} of that evening I was more lively than is my wont, for it was <b>a</b> very <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be lively in that family. I do not think I gave any one reason to suppose that I was a man whose {{attention}} had been called to a notice not to trespass.|$|R
6000|$|... "Delicious corners {{are very}} well, {{and so is}} the ancient world," [...] said Mr. Rawson; [...] "but one may sit here hungry and shabby, so long as one isn't too shabby, as well as elsewhere. You'll not persuade me that it's not <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> keep afloat yonder than here. I wish I were in Yankeeland, that's all!" [...] he added with feeble force. Then {{brooding}} for a moment on his wrongs: [...] "Have you a bloated brother? or you, sir? It matters little to you. But it has mattered to me with a vengeance! Shabby as I sit here I can boast that advantage--as he his five thousand a year. Being but a twelvemonth my elder he swaggers while I go thus. There's old England for you! A very pretty place for HIM!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> tell a daughter, {{but it must}} be told. It {{is thought}} by some, then, that your father helps to their death a few of those that he finds dead.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You little rogue, so you {{see through}} me!" [...] Surely it was <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> say; {{but what he did}} say was [...] "Thank you." [...] Then to himself he said, [...] "Ass, ass, ass!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In the West we don't {{pretend to}} go out in such a storm," [...] remarked Cora Dartmore. [...] "But, of course, our {{distances}} are greater, and we have so few landmarks that it is <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> get lost." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here we are safe," [...] Jean said, as they alighted {{from the}} carriage. [...] "It would take {{nothing short of}} an army to fight its way through these woods and lanes and, if the Assembly try to {{interfere}} with us, they will find it <b>a</b> much <b>easier</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> pull down the throne of France, than to subdue La Vendee." ...|$|R
5000|$|DNA Distribution was {{acquired}} by Burton Snowboards on February 5, 2008 and several months later, on May 2, 2008, the Flip Skateboards company announced that its long-term team member Arto Saari had relocated to Alien Workshop—the announcement {{was a shock to}} members of the skateboarding media. In 2012, Saari provided further insight into his decision to leave Flip, citing the death of former teammate Shane Cross as an underpinning factor: [...] "It wasn't, like, <b>a</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do, but, at the time, I knew I had to do it ... for the reasons that happened, you know?

6000|$|... "None. But {{neither has}} any {{acknowledged}} it. When you lay wounded below {{it had been}} <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> for me <b>to</b> ha' played the traitor. I might ha' sailed these ships {{into the mouth of}} Tagus. I might so by God!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{used to have}} {{hunting down}} in Cornwall, and thought we did it pretty well. And I have ridden in South Wales, which I can assure you isn't <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do. But you mustn't expect much from me." ...|$|E
60|$|Once on {{the wreck}} it was <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> obtain {{the dishes and}} the knives, forks and spoons, and also some other things they thought they might require. They also brought away another gun, loading it up before leaving the ship.|$|E
60|$|A rocket {{may seem}} to be <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> see but, in a large fleet, the stern-most smacks may be three or four miles away from the leaders and, in a dark, thick night, it is {{exceedingly}} difficult to make out even a rocket, at that distance.|$|E
60|$|And when we return, {{proud and}} {{satisfied}} with our endeavors, we {{will prove to}} the poor fellows who were obliged {{to stay at home}} and shoot tit-birds and rabbits, with real guns, what <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> it is <b>to</b> hunt the biggest kind of game--in a book.|$|R
5000|$|... "I started Earth Shaker about 4 {{years before}} it {{appeared}} in Your Sinclair. A Boulder Dash clone seemed like <b>a</b> reasonably <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> program. I thought Boulder Dash was great and played it for ages. I'm still fascinated by the way you can get such complicated behaviour and realistic avalanches by using a few simple rules. Earth Shaker just grew - I kept leaving it {{and going back to}} it. But it was the first machine code game I managed to actually finish." ...|$|R
