5|$|Having {{resolved}} {{to explore the}} island of Rasay, which could be done only on foot, I last night obtained my fellow-traveller’s permission to leave him for a day, he being unable to take so hardy a walk. Old Mr Malcolm M’Cleod, who had obligingly promised to <b>accompany</b> <b>me,</b> was at my bedside between five and six. I sprang up immediately, and he and I, attended by two other gentlemen, traversed the country during the whole of this day. Though we had passed over not less than four-and-twenty miles of very rugged ground, and had a Highland dance {{on the top of}} Dùn Can, the highest mountain in the island, we returned in the evening not at all fatigued, and piqued ourselves at not being outdone at the nightly ball by our less active friends, who had remained at home.|$|E
25|$|When General Bell first {{sent me to}} Victor I {{offered him}} certain {{evidence}} {{in regard to the}} perpetrators of the Vindicator explosion, which he has failed to follow up, but which would have led to the arrest and conviction of the men who are responsible for the placing of that infernal machine. At about the 20th of January, 1904, by order of the adjutant of Teller County military district, and under special direction of Major T. E. McClelland and General F. M. Reardon, who was the Governor's confidential adviser regarding the conditions in that district, a series of street fights were commenced between men of Victor and soldiers of the National Guard on duty there. Each fight was planned by General Reardon or Major McClelland and carried out under their actual direction. Major McClelland's instructions were literally to knock them down, knock their teeth down their throats, bend in their faces, kick in their ribs and do everything except kill them. These fights continued more or less frequently up to the 22d of March. About the middle of February General Reardon called me into Major McClelland's office and asked me if I had a man in whom I could place absolute confidence. I called in Sergeant J. A. Chase, Troop C, First Cavalry, N. G. C., and, in the presence of Sergeant Chase, he stated to me that, owing to the refusal of the Mine Owners' Association to furnish the necessary money to meet the payroll of the troops, it had become necessary to take some steps to force them to put up the cash, and he desired me to take Sergeant Chase and hold up or shoot the men coming off shift at the Vindicator mine at 2 o'clock in the morning. I told General Reardon that I {{was under the impression that}} most of these men caught the electric car that stopped at the shaft house so that such a plan would be impracticable. He then said to me that the same end could be reached if I would take the sergeant and fire fifty or sixty shots into the Vindicator shaft house at some time during the night. Owing to circumstances making it impossible for Sergeant Chase to <b>accompany</b> <b>me,</b> I took Sergeant Gordon Walter of the same troop and organization, and that same night did at about 12:30 o'clock fire repeatedly into the Vindicator and Lillie shaft house. Something like sixty shots were fired from our revolvers at this time. Afterwards we mounted our horses and rode into Victor and into the Military Club, reporting in person to General Reardon and Major McClelland. The next day General Reardon directed me to take Sergeant Walter and look over the ground in the rear of the Findlay mine with a view of repeating the performance there, but before the plan could be carried out General Reardon countermanded the order, stating his reason to be that the mine owners had promised to put up the necessary money the next day, which, as a matter of fact, they did. General Reardon, in giving me directions regarding the shooting up of the Vindicator shaft house, stated that Governor Peabody, General Bell, he himself, and I were the only ones who knew anything about the plan.|$|E

2500|$|In his remarks, he {{also said}} [...] "I intend to seek further {{information}} on matters {{as reported by the}} Reader's Digest author—and I would hope that a fair minded person like Congressman Abercrombie would <b>accompany</b> <b>me</b> early next year if, and when, we can both work a visit into our schedule—a visit that would not involve the expenditure of any American tax dollars.|$|E
2500|$|When Yuan Shu {{heard of}} Lu Su's fame, {{he wanted to}} recruit him {{to serve as the}} Chief of Dongcheng County (東城縣) under him. However, Lu Su saw that Yuan Shu's {{administration}} was ill-disciplined and believed that Yuan would not be successful. He told his followers, [...] "The central government has failed. Robbers and bandits are rampant. The areas around the Huai and Si rivers are no longer safe. I heard the lands in Jiangdong are fertile, its population is prosperous, and its army is powerful. We can take shelter there. Are you willing to <b>accompany</b> <b>me</b> to that paradise and wait until the situation here stabilises?" [...] They unanimously agreed to follow him.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was walking}} {{about in a}} town which I did not know. [...] I saw streets and squares which were strange to me. [...] Then I came into a house where I lived, went to my room, and found a letter from Mother lying there. [...] She wrote saying that as I had left home without my parents' {{knowledge}} she had not wished to write to me to say Father was ill. [...] "Now he is dead, and if you like you can come." [...] I {{then went to the}} station and asked about a hundred times: [...] "Where is the station?" [...] I always got the answer: [...] "Five minutes." [...] I then saw a thick wood before me which I went into, and there I asked a man whom I met. [...] He said to me: [...] "Two and a half hours more." [...] He offered to <b>accompany</b> <b>me.</b> [...] But I refused and went alone. I saw the station {{in front of me and}} could not reach it. [...] At the same time, I had the unusual feeling of anxiety that one has in dreams when one cannot move forward. Then I was at home. I must have been travelling in the meantime, but I knew nothing about that. I walked into the porter's lodge, and enquired for our flat. The maidservant opened the door to me and replied that Mother and the others were already at the cemetery.|$|E

2500|$|Sun Ce told Taishi Ci, [...] "In the past, when Liu Yao criticised me {{for helping}} Yuan Shu conquer Lujiang, he didn't have good {{intentions}} and his reasons were not convincing. Why? Yuan Shu had {{control over the}} thousands of troops {{which used to be}} under my father's command. I wanted to make great achievements, so I {{had no choice but to}} submit to Yuan Shu and ask him to give me control of my father's troops. Even then, he only gave me back about 1,000 men. When he ordered me to attack Lujiang, the circumstances I was in were so desperate that I had no choice but to obey him. Later on, he turned evil and wanted to commit treacherous acts. I tried to dissuade him but he wouldn't listen. That was when I decided to sever ties with him. My relationship with Yuan Shu is only up to this extent. Now that Liu Yao is dead, there is no chance for me to explain to him anymore. However, his son still lives in Yuzhang. I don't know how Hua Ziyu treats him, and whether Liu Yao's former followers have decided to serve Hua Ziyu. You are from the same commandery as Liu Yao, and you served under him before. I hope you can visit his son and convey my wishes to his followers. If they wish to join me, I will welcome them; if they don't, do treat them kindly. At the same time, you can assess how strong Hua Ziyu's defences are, and see if the peoples of Luling and Poyang are willing to join me. You can bring along as many men as you wish." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I have committed unpardonable acts. Yet, you treat me as generously as how Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin treated former enemies who surrendered to them. The ancients lived by a code of loyalty until death. I don't need too many men to <b>accompany</b> <b>me.</b> Just a dozen or so will be sufficient." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, for us, Sir Andrew," [...] she replied, whilst {{the ghost}} of a smile flitted across her drawn face; [...] "you had thought of <b>accompanying</b> <b>me</b> to Paris, had you not?" ...|$|R
