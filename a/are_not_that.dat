25|$|In folklore, when {{a custom}} {{is too old}} for its origins to be remembered, a story is often devised to rationalise what would {{otherwise}} be baffling. However the ‘official’ story of the Hood's origins <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> unlikely. There are parallels between the Hood and bog burials in Europe. The game takes place {{on the border of}} bogs where naturally-preserved mummies of prehistoric sacrifices have been found.|$|E
25|$|Between {{two phases}} in {{equilibrium}} {{there is a}} narrow region where the properties <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> of either phase. Although this region may be very thin, it can have significant and easily observable effects, such as causing a liquid to exhibit surface tension. In mixtures, some components may preferentially move toward the interface. In terms of modeling, describing, or understanding {{the behavior of a}} particular system, it may be efficacious to treat the interfacial region as a separate phase.|$|E

25|$|The UAE {{features}} spin-friendly pitches. New ball {{helps the}} bowlers and bowlers eye reverse swing and spin {{with the older}} ball. UAE conditions differ significantly from those of Pakistan due to the Gulf's sandy soils. Bowlers with a straight arm action like Johan Botha tend to reap wickets at these pitches. Grounds <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> hard. Dubai Cricket Stadium offers some grass and bounce though dry conditions tend to result in {{the fourth and fifth}} days of a test match being spin friendly. Sheikh Zayed Stadium is batting-friendly, and the cracks come very late into play.|$|E
25|$|The current Moore Park site {{hosts the}} Great Hall, other school {{buildings}}, tennis courts, a gymnasium, the Junior Quadrangle, and the Flat, a common low-lying area of land between Sydney Boys and Sydney Girls High Schools. The school buildings include approximately 60 classrooms, two change rooms, the Junior Library (for Years 7–9), and the Senior Library (for Years 10–12). Most disciplines are individual departments {{and have their}} own common rooms; however, others <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> clearly divided or some teachers take classes {{in more than one}} discipline. For example, some English teachers in the English department also teach Drama; some History teachers in the History department also teach Studies of Religion.|$|E
25|$|The Jain {{religion}} {{places a}} great deal of emphasis on purity of conduct and the ability of the soul to attain liberation through the highest level of meditation. However, there <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> many books on meditation written by the Jains. This automatically places this text in an exclusive category, along with Jinabhadra Gani's Dhyanashataka, Pujyapada's Samadhitantra, Haribhadra's Yogabindu and Yogadrshtisamuccaya, Jinasena's Adipurana, Amitagati's Yogasara Prabhrta and Shravakacara, Gunabhadra's Atmanushasana and Hemacandra's Yogashastra. There is an uncanny resemblance between this text and Hemacandra's ‘Yogashastra’. Clearly, one has influenced the other. Since Shubhacandra precedes Hemacandra, it is likely that Hemacandra is influenced by Shubhacandra.|$|E

25|$|Wine expert Tom Stevenson {{describes}} the classic profile of Sancerre blanc as bone dry, highly aromatic with intense flavors of peaches and gooseberries. He describes Sancerre rouge as being light to medium bodied with floral aromas and delicate flavors. The Pinot noir based rosés {{are described as}} dry and light bodied with raspberry and strawberry notes. Other wine experts such as Jancis Robinson and Hugh Johnson note {{that in recent years}} overproduction has introduced a lot of variable quality with some Sancerre blancs producing flavor profiles that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> much different from generic Sauvignon de Touraine from the Middle Loire, though this varies depending on the producer and overall quality of the vintage.|$|E
25|$|These flows usually begin {{when the}} pore {{pressures}} in a fine-grained mass increase until {{enough of the}} weight of the material is supported by pore water to significantly decrease the internal shearing strength of the material. This thereby creates a bulging lobe which advances with a slow, rolling motion. As these lobes spread out, drainage of the mass increases and the margins dry out, thereby lowering the overall velocity of the flow. This process causes the flow to thicken. The bulbous variety of earthflows <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> spectacular, but they are much more common than their rapid counterparts. They develop a sag at their heads and are usually derived from the slumping at the source.|$|E
25|$|An unusual species, Turritopsis dohrnii, {{formerly}} {{classified as}} T. nutricula, might be effectively immortal {{because of its}} ability under certain circumstances to transform from medusa back to the polyp stage, thereby escaping the death that typically awaits medusae post-reproduction if they have not otherwise been eaten by some other ocean organism. So far this reversal has been observed only in the laboratory. At least one professor at the Seto Marine Biological Laboratory at Kyoto University in Japan has concluded {{that there are three}} species of jellyfish that are immortal, and says their immortality may hold the key to immortality for human beings, as he says that genetically they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> much different from humans.|$|E

25|$|Likewise, some entirely Old English names {{explicitly}} {{point to}} Roman structures, usually using Latin loan-words, {{or to the}} presence of Brittonic-speakers. Names like Wickham clearly denoted the kind of Roman settlement known in Latin as a vicus, and others end in elements denoting Roman features, such as -caster, denoting castra ('forts'). There is a substantial body of names along the lines of Walton/Walcot/Walsall, many of which must include the Old English word wealh in the sense 'Celtic-speaker',, Esne, Þræl]' (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, University of Leeds, 2014), esp. p. 90. and Comberton, many of which must include Old English Cumbre 'Britons'. These are likely to have been names for enclaves of Brittonic-speakers─but again <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> numerous.|$|E
25|$|More recently, it {{has become}} clear that the Anseriformes (waterfowl) and the Galliformes are the most ancient groups of modern birds. It is possible, though not at all well-supported, that these were {{distinct}} {{by the end of the}} Albian 100 million years ago (Ma). Loons belong to a more modern radiation. They were once believed to be related to grebes, which are also foot-propelled diving birds, and both species were once classified together under the order Colymbiformes. However, as recently as the 1930s, it was determined that the two groups <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> closely related at all and are merely the product of convergent evolution and adapted in a similar way to a similar ecological niche. The similarity is so strong that even the most modern cladistic analyses of general anatomical features are easily misled into grouping loons and grebes.|$|E
500|$|Considerable {{anatomic}} variation exists, {{in terms}} of length and point of attachment. Despite the classical description, the muscle only solely attaches to the duodenojejunal flexure in about 8% of people; {{it is far more}} common, 40 to 60% of the time to attach additionally to the third and fourth parts of the duodenum; and 20 to 30% [...] of the time it only attaches to the third and fourth parts. Moreover, separate multiple attachments <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> uncommon.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu {{said that the}} film works as it melds an interesting screen line with racy action.

She then declared, [...] " [...] some of the best camera shots, stunts and locations on a mind-boggling scale have been showcased. If you enjoy magnificence in cinema you will like this Anniyan." [...] Krishnakumar wrote for Rediff.com that learning from the debacle of Boys, the director went back to his strength by taking a social theme, spicing it up and serving the perfect commercial fare.

Labelling the film as a [...] "must see", a reviewer at Sify acclaimed that the film holds the viewers riveted with its racy narration, a relevant message backed with technical wizardry, never-seen before colourful song picturisation and particularly the performance of Vikram. Yet, the reviewer criticised that the film was too lengthy and the story too thin on logic.|$|E
