5|$|Unlike the laminar {{boundary}} layer equations, the presence of two regimes governed by different sets of flow scales (i.e. {{the inner and outer}} scaling) has made finding a universal similarity solution for the turbulent {{boundary layer}} difficult and controversial. To find a similarity solution that spans both regions of the flow, it is necessary to asymptotically match the solutions from both regions of the flow.

Students in the D.Min. concentration in Pastoral Care & Counseling / Pastoral Theology will benefit from advanced theological study and professional work specifically designed for those who desire to serve as chaplains, pastoral care specialists, pastoral counselors or congregational pastors. The program emphasizes the helping relationship, theological understandings of pastoral care, the multicultural contexts of pastoral care, psychotherapeutic theories and strategies for change, and various forms of pastoral care and counseling. A race, class, and gender <b>analysis</b> <b>will</b> be appropriated {{to the practice of}} care and counseling. Questions regarding the program may be directed to Danielle Hunter, Director, D. Min.

If conversion is incomplete, the subsequent <b>analysis</b> <b>will</b> incorrectly interpret the unconverted unmethylated cytosines as methylated cytosines, resulting in false positive results for methylation. Only cytosines in single-stranded DNA are susceptible to attack by bisulfite, therefore denaturation of the DNA undergoing analysis is critical. It is important to ensure that reaction parameters such as temperature and salt concentration are suitable to maintain the DNA in a single-stranded conformation and allow for complete conversion. Embedding the DNA in agarose gel {{has been reported to}} improve the rate of conversion by keeping strands of DNA physically separate.|$|E
25|$|VNAs {{designed}} for the simultaneous measurement of the S-parameters of networks with more than two ports are feasible but quickly become prohibitively complex and expensive. Usually their purchase is not justified since the required measurements can be obtained using a standard 2-port calibrated VNA with extra measurements followed by the correct interpretation of the results obtained. The required S-parameter matrix can be assembled from successive two port measurements in stages, two ports at a time, on each occasion with the unused ports being terminated in high quality loads equal to the system impedance. One risk {{of this approach is}} that the return loss or VSWR of the loads themselves must be suitably specified to be {{as close as possible to}} a perfect 50 Ohms, or whatever the nominal system impedance is. For a network with many ports there may be a temptation, on grounds of cost, to inadequately specify the VSWRs of the loads. Some <b>analysis</b> <b>will</b> be necessary to determine what the worst acceptable VSWR of the loads will be.|$|E

25|$|One popular {{configuration}} for {{the mixing}} tube {{is a large}} bore tube {{with a series of}} internal baffles which create turbulence in the mixture after the injection point, which causes fairly rapid mixing to a homogenous mixture, which may then be continuously analysed by a monitoring instrument before further processing, or may be directly processed and analysed later from the storage cylinder. Continuous analysis allows adjustment of flow rate of the added gases to correct the mixture if it deviates from the specification. Post-analysis makes correction more difficult. Addition of components may be done in sequence or together. Adding them together means that mixing is done once, and this reduces the pressure loss in the intake system. It is important that the gases are thoroughly mixed before analysis as the <b>analysis</b> <b>will</b> then be more reliable. It is also highly desirable to ensure that the intake gases do not vary significantly in oxygen content over time for safety reasons, as the compressor will probably only be safe for a limited oxygen fraction.|$|E

2500|$|Although serial {{correlation}} {{does not affect}} the consistency of [...] the estimated regression coefficients, it does affect our ability to conduct valid statistical tests. First, the F-statistic to test for overall significance of the regression may be inflated under positive {{serial correlation}} because the mean squared error (MSE) will tend to underestimate the population error variance. Second, positive serial correlation typically causes the ordinary least squares (OLS) standard errors for the regression coefficients to underestimate the true standard errors. As a consequence, if positive serial correlation is present in the regression, standard linear regression <b>analysis</b> <b>will</b> typically lead us to compute artificially small standard errors for the regression coefficient. These small standard errors will cause the estimated t-statistic to be inflated, suggesting significance where perhaps there is none. The inflated t-statistic, may in turn, lead us to incorrectly reject null hypotheses, about population values of the parameters of the regression model more often than we would if the standard errors were correctly estimated.|$|E

2500|$|Pure {{ethylene}} glycol has a {{specific heat capacity}} about one half that of water. [...] So, while providing freeze protection and an increased boiling point, {{ethylene glycol}} lowers the specific heat capacity of water mixtures relative to pure water. [...] A 1:1 mix by mass has a specific heat capacity of about 3140 J/(kg·°C) (0.75 BTU/(lb·°F)), three quarters that of pure water, thus requiring increased flow rates in same system comparisons with water. The formation of large bubbles in cooling passages of internal combustion engines will seriously inhibit heat flow (flux) from that area, thus allowing nucleation (tiny bubbles) heat transfer to occur is not advisable. Large bubbles in cooling passages will be self-sustaining or grow larger, with virtually {{the complete loss of}} cooling in that spot. With pure MEG that hot spot has to get to 200 °C. Cooling due to other effects such as air draft from fan etc. (not considered in pure nucleation <b>analysis)</b> <b>will</b> assist in preventing large-bubble formation.|$|E
