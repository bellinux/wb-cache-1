40|$|Chapter 1 {{presents}} a general introduction to NuRD. The NuRD complex {{is a widely}} conserved transcriptional coregulator that harbours both nucleosome remodelling and histone deacetylase activities. Abnormalities {{in a number of}} its constituent proteins are associated with both cancer and ageing. Although we have a fairly complete ‘parts list’ for NuRD, our understanding of what the parts <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>and,</b> in particular, how they fit together lags a long way behind. In mammals, the NuRD complex consists of approximately 10 proteins that are consistently observed in purifications of the complex. These components are CHD 3 / 4, HDAC 1 / 2, p 66 α/p 66 β, MBD 2 / 3, RbAp 46 / 48 and MTA 1 - 3. MTA 1 is now considered {{to be one of the}} most up-regulated proteins in human cancers. However, essentially nothing is known at the molecular level about how MTA 1 either mediates its normal functions or acts in cancer. Chapter 2 presents efforts to obtain structural information on the N-terminal domains of MTA 1 using bacterial and insect cell expression approaches. In order to begin to understand the makeup of the NuRD complex, we focused on inter-subunit interactions. RbAp 48 and MTA 1 are key components of the NuRD complex, and previous studies have reported that MTA 1 interacts with the core complex RbAp 46 / 48 and HDAC 1 / 2. However, the molecular basis for this interaction is not known. Chapter 3 describes work carried out using pulldown assays to probe the interaction between the subunits RbAp 46 / 48 and MTA 1 / 2. Both MTA 1 and MTA 2 were found to bind to RbAp 46 / 48 using the C-terminal end. Chapters 4 and 5 describe a more detailed analysis of this interaction. The interaction was confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and the structure of MTA 1 -RbAp 48 complex was determined using X-ray crystallography. The interaction is mediated by the C-terminal motif (KRAARR) of MTA 1. It seems that the MTA 1 -RbAp 48 interaction is conserved across species containing a NuRD-like complex. The structure reveals that RbAp 48, which is a WD 40 protein, interacts with MTA 1 specifically via the histone H 4 binding site, which is located to the side groove on RbAp 48. These data provide a starting point for understanding both the assembly of the NuRD complex and its biochemical mechanism of action. Chapter 6 re{{presents a}} final discussion that puts our results into context...|$|E

40|$|Academic {{libraries}} will be circulating print {{books for}} a long time to come. But circulation stats continue to fall in tandem with budget allocations for print resources, and students and faculty increasingly demand access to books online. So what would happen if we stopped buying print books altogether? Could a small to medium-sized academic library adequately support existing student and faculty research with an entirely electronic book collection? In an attempt to answer these questions, circulation statistics for print books will be examined in relation to market availability of equivalent ebook titles. The presentation will focus on the availability in electronic format of a sample of print titles circulated in the past year at Royal Roads University Library, what that electronic access <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like,</b> <b>and</b> what it would all cost compared to purchasing and maintaining the equivalent in print.

40|$|We live in {{a global}} village where {{electronic}} communication has eliminated the geographical barriers of information exchange. The road is now open to worldwide convergence of information interests, shared values and understanding. Nevertheless, interests still vary between countries around the world. This raises important questions about what today’s world map of information interests <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>and</b> what factors cause the barriers of information exchange between countries. To quantitatively construct a world map of information interests, we devise a scalable statistical model that identifies countries with similar information interests and measures the countries’ bilateral similarities. From the similarities we connect countries in a global network and find that countries can be mapped into 18 clusters with similar information interests. Through regression we find that language and religion best explain {{the strength of the}} bilateral ties and formation of clusters. Our findings provide a quantitative basis for further studies to better understand the complex interplay between shared interests and conflict on a global scale. The methodology can also be extended to track changes over time and capture important trends in global information exchange.

40|$|Sweden is {{generally}} regarded as a country with little corruption, equal rights {{for men and women}} and a strong emphasis on democratic values. Still, the appointment of political representatives to the boards of municipal corporations occurs without consideration of these values. One step towards increasing our knowledge about the governance of municipal corporations in Sweden is to look at how current governance processes affect accountability in relation to municipal corporations. Therefore, and with the discussion above as a backdrop, this chapter will be dedicated to opening up the ‘black box’ of the party organizations and shedding light on what the process of appointing board members <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>and</b> how this process influences transparency and the ability to secure accountability in relation to the political corporate governance of Swedish municipal corporations. This is {{in spite of the fact}} that issues concerning lack of transparency and corruption in municipal corporations have been raised over the last couple of years. In this chapter, the process of appointing members to the boards of Swedish municipal corporations is scrutinized, showing a lack of transparency in the nomination process as well as a lack of political responsibility when it comes to the overall composition of the board...|$|R

30|$|Despite {{the pervasiveness}} of (implicit) {{assumptions}} {{about the relationship between}} formal qualifications and skills in research on labor market inequalities, there is very little robust empirical knowledge about what this relationship <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>and</b> whether it differs across countries—partly due to a shortage of data on the skills of adults. Many cross-national studies of labor market inequalities by educational attainment refer to signaling explanations (e.g., Andersen and Van de Werfhorst 2010; Bol and Van de Werfhorst 2011), but they do not include direct measures of skill transparency based on empirical information about skill distributions. Abrassart (2013) uses data on 14 countries from the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) and finds that the labor market disadvantage of less-educated relative to intermediate-educated adults (measured as the adjusted difference in employment rates) is related to the skills gap at the country level. He also speculates that this relationship might be attributable to the signaling mechanism (i.e., statistical discrimination related to formal qualifications) being stronger in countries with a larger skills gap. However, his analysis does not control for skills at the individual level, so it is unclear to what extent the aggregate-level association picks up the direct, individual-level effects of skills (as emphasized by the human capital approach). Moreover, Abrassart (2013) does not consider the internal homogeneity of the different educational groups.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a two part work, that deals mostly with the visual aspect of urban design, done {{partly as a}} {{cooperation}} between a landscape architect and a housing architect. While rooted in established conventions for structuring a city, it is focused more on what ”city” <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like,</b> <b>and</b> why that is. It {{should be noted that}} while parts of the work are developed with nordic conditions in mind, most of it should be applicable to other climate zones as well. One part is a collection of tools and observations for urban design, both being used as guidelines during the design work for the proposal and {{to be used as a}} reference in the future, when working with other projects. The observations are certain issues that I feel I should be aware of when designing, and the tools are more directly usable when designing, as a base to be adapted to specific conditions. Each tool and observation can be used by their own, but typically one would use several of them together, when working on a project. The other part is a proposal for redesigning the Båstad city centre, implemented both on a a structural, overall scale and on a more detailed level, down to individual courtyards. Some of the tools were used, and adapted to specific conditions, when designing the proposal and some of the tools are derived from the work with the proposal. The purpose of these two parts goes beyond that of this master’s thesis, and are intended to be usable by themselves, outside of the academic world...|$|R

The main aim of {{this study}} was to explore how early years {{professionals}} define 'what Children's Rights <b>look</b> <b>like</b> within their practice. This research relates to previous work based research undertaken to explore professional early years training opportunities to deliver CPD. The work of Schon (1987) on reflective practice and Archard (2005) on Children’s Rights provides the underpinning theoretical framework. This small scale qualitative research was conducted from an interpretative perspective. Reflective journals and small focus groups were used to explore how early years practitioners identified 'what Children's Rights <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> in practice' <b>and</b> ‘the skills set required to offer child led provision’. All participants were informed of this research and of its purpose. Ethical procedures for ensuring confidentiality have been put in place. Findings suggest that capturing ‘what’ Children’s Rights <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> within practice is challenging to quantify. The majority of practitioners reflected that transforming their knowledge into a definite skill, product or aspect of practice is both complex and challenging to articulate. Therefore, further vocational training to develop a children’s rights based approach is required. The knowledge gained from this research will be used to underpin future research to impact upon professional practitioner training and modify how a year three Children’s Rights module is delivered...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} {{an outline of}} the problem and the {{introduction}} to further research on the process of Latinization of the rites of Polish Armenians. So far researchers have primarily underlined the influence of the Catholic Church on Polonization of Armenians. They indicated that the union between Armenian and Catholic churches accelerated the process of Catholization of Armenian settlers. However questions on what the Catholization process <b>actually</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like,</b> its course, <b>and</b> symptoms have remained mostly unanswered. The way the unification process was accomplished in 1630 by bishop Mikołaj Torosowicz, himself a rather controversial personality, accompanying conflicts and divisions in the initial period contributed to deepening the existing differences. The author is trying to find answers to several important questions, among the others of how the activity of the Papal College in Lvov and the convent of Armenian Benedictine nuns contributed to the rapproachement of both rites. How was Latinization reflected in Armenian rites (new services, prayers, and songs that emerged) ? What were the new places of religious cult taken over or adopted by Armenians from the Roman Catholic Church? What role did the Armenian Synod in Lvov in 1689 play in the history of Armenian Catholic Church? How was the adoption of the church union by Armenians reflected in culture and arts (among the others in music, architecture, painting, miniature, and language) ? Such information will enable to formulate initial conclusions of the influence of the Latin Church on religious and social life of Polish Armenians {{in the course of the}} 17 th and 18 th centuries. They will also allow to answer the question whether the adoption of the church union by Armenians really contributed to their Polonization, as indicated by historiography (particularly the Ukrainian one) or was the process easier due to acculturation which occurred much earlier...|$|R
40|$|Taxation equity may be {{classified}} into horizontal equity, where {{people who are}} in the same economic position should be taxed the same, and vertical equity, where those who differ economically should be treated differently. In the New Zealand income tax, the vertical equity norm has primarily been achieved by progressive tax rates, and by family-friendly adjustments. Given that the income tax intentionally discriminates between taxpayers on the basis of taxpayer-specific characteristics such as income level and domestic situation, the question arises as to how the New Zealand income tax in its successive manifestations has been justified as fair; that is, what vertical equity in the New Zealand income tax <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>and</b> how it was justified. This thesis considers the practice of the New Zealand income tax since its introduction in 1891 until 1984. By illuminating an employee’s lived experience of the income tax, it illustrates what taxation fairness <b>actually</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> in practice, <b>and</b> contrasts this with the rhetoric of those responsible for the tax. It concludes that the reality of external events, rather than the rhetoric of taxation fairness, appears to have been the main driver of taxation practice. By focusing attention on the experience of the taxpayer, rather than merely on aggregated taxation data, legislative provisions or political discussion, the thesis permits the political rhetoric or fairness to be assessed against the fiscal impact on personal taxpayers. The thesis commences by reviewing certain influences on New Zealand income tax thought: from religion, antiquity, and more particularly from certain key British philosophers. It finds that despite their importance, these do not provide a clear direction for taxation policy. The thesis then shifts from philosophical discussions of what constitutes a fair tax to look at what the income tax <b>actually</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> in the case of a wage or salary earner. It adopts an inductive approach by calculating the effect of the income tax legislation on employees at three income levels and in three domestic situations. The resulting nine cases demonstrate how taxpayers were distinguished for the purposes of vertical equity. Returning to the sources, this thesis then reviews contemporary Parliamentary Debates and Reports for evidence of how Parliament justified the practice of vertical equity in the income tax. Despite frequent appeals to fairness or equity, no clear basis was found. Rather, significant changes to the income tax, and thus to the practice of vertical equity, largely reflected pragmatic responses to political or economic events. Yet once such crises had passed, the income tax, and vertical equity in that tax, did not revert to the pre-crisis shape, but rather conformed to a new paradigm...|$|R
40|$|The normal {{clocking}} {{strategies are}} not applicable at very high frequencies due to the signal integrity problems. The speed of any high speed circuit is ultimately determined by the I/O circuits associated with it. This paper describes a comparison between different clocking strategies and gives a range of application of these. &# 13; &# 13; During 1970 - 1990, gates switched so slowly that - digital signals <b>actually</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> ones <b>and</b> zeros. Analog modeling of signal propagation was not necessary. At today’s speeds the simple, passive elements of a system viz, Wires, PC boards traces, Connectors, and Chip Packages - make up {{a significant part of}} the overall signal delay. Further these elements cause glitches, resets, logic errors, and other problems. As the designs are pushed towards higher operating speeds. For high-performance boards, MCMs and systems, interconnect design must be specified and driven from electrical requirements to: (1) Meet setup and hold times & guarantee signal integrity (2) Avoid design / layout / verification iterations (3) Ensure low manufacturing costs and high reliability&# 13; &# 13; The conventional signaling technique, called Common Clock (CC) signaling [support by reference], relies on a single system clock distributed to all bus agents as a common reference. All transactions are performed latch-to-latch using this common clock reference. &# 13; &# 13; Trace propagation delays are governed by trace length. Trace lengths are often governed by the thermal solution. As speeds increase, heat sinks get larger and force components farther away from each other, which limit the speed of a common-clock bus design. &# 13; Source-Synchronous clocking refers to the technique of sourcing a clock along with the data. Specifically, the timing of unidirectional data signals is referenced to a clock (often called the strobe) sourced by the same device that generates those signals, and not to a global clock (i. e. generated by a bus master). A reason that source-synchronous clocking is useful is that it has been observed that all of the circuits within a given semiconductor device experience roughly the same process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variation. This means signal propagation delay experienced by the data through a device tracks the delay experienced by the clock through that same device over PVT&# 13; &# 13; A more radical approach for reducing the clocking overhead is to eliminate the clock entirely. Such designs are called self-timed designs. Self-timed systems provide completion information along with their data values. This completion information controls the sequencing of data through the machine and can be encoded in the data (true self-timing) or can be generated by using delay-matching circuits...|$|R

Using a census of the U.

The citizen-soldier theory contends that failure {{on the part of}} the U.

Much of the existing research on the military applauds its racially progressive policies and the (overall) proportionately representative forces it maintains. However, there is little scrutiny of what those forces <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> broken down by rank. If the military is to maintain a truly representative force of citizen-soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines, then it must be representative among all levels.
