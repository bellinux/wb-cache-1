40|$|In recent work, Stacey Tevlin and Karl Whelan {{argue that}} <b>aggregate</b> <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> fail {{to capture the}} US {{investment}} boom in plant and machinery {{in the second half}} of the 1990 s, whereas a disaggregated approach does much better. In particular, they show that aggregate models do not capture the increase in replacement investment associated with compositional shifts in the capital stock towards high depreciation rate assets, such as computers. And aggregate models invariably find little or no role for the real user cost, so do not pick up the strong effects of relative price declines on investment in computers. In this paper, a data set for the United Kingdom is constructed in order to investigate the ability of different equations to account for the UK boom in plant and machinery investment {{in the second half of}} the 1990 s. The findings are similar to those of Tevlin and Whelan, whose analysis is extended in two main ways. First, the failure of the aggregate equations is explained more formally in terms of misspecification when relative prices are trending downwards. Second, the econometric analysis is conducted in a formal cointegration framework. As in the United States, the paper shows that asset-level equations can explain the investment boom in plant and machinery in the second half of the 1990 s in the United Kingdom, whereas the aggregate equation fails completely. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{belief in}} {{education}} 2 ̆ 7 s vitality {{in the economic}} development of Iran set the present study 2 ̆ 7 s objectives: {{an analysis of the}} role and impact of education on the political-economic development of Iran; the identification of Iran 2 ̆ 7 s educational problems; the measurement of education 2 ̆ 7 s impact on the Iranian economy; and the propositions on policy reforms to facilitate development of the country. ^ An overview of Iran 2 ̆ 7 s economy reveals that sectoral and regional integrations were weak. Iran 2 ̆ 7 s agriculture had been backsliding. The land reform failed due to inappropriate institutions and, thus, agricultural problems were aggravated. The absence of sectoral integration and dependence of industry on the oil sector and imported inputs and technology inhibited sustained economic growth in Iran. ^ Economic development in Iran requires parallel development of physical and human capital. Despite considerable industrialization, Iran lacked a harmonious expansion of educational and other infrastructure facilities. Shortage of high-level manpower created bottlenecks to organic development of the Iranian economy. Shortage of human resources and inadequacy of infrastructure resulted from the educational and institutional problems, which were rooted in inefficient socio-economic organs governing the economy. ^ Education raises economic efficiency by improving the quality of economic agents, transmits socially accepted values, improves and regenerates existing institutions, modifies outdated institutions, and creates new ones to induce economic growth. ^ Education is an agent to increase human satisfactions and critical thinking, and to reduce income inequality. The positive relationship between the rates of return and the levels of education signifies the instrumentality of education in economic and political development of Iran. ^ The dynamic analysis of the inherently stable <b>aggregate</b> <b>econometric</b> <b>model,</b> containing equations for private consumption and government expenditures, investment outlays, imports of goods and services, and income identities, indicated that the impacts of education on the Iranian economy were moderate during the first ten years of the sampling period (1960 - 1977). These impacts became larger during the remaining years due to impressive expansion of educational facilities which were made possible by sharp rise of oil revenues. ...|$|E
40|$|Unprecedented {{movements}} in real exchange rates during the 1980 s led to suspicions of {{instability in the}} exchange rate - trade relationships in the UK and elsewhere. 1 be research in this thesis investigates the sensitivity of UK trade volumes to {{movements in}} the real exchange rate, and considers various interpretations of the alleged parameter instability: econometric misspecification; theoretical inadequacy due {{to the neglect of}} possible hysteresis effects and/or the neglect of supply side factors; and the Lucas critique effects of a changed policy regime on expectations formation. Against the background of UK experience we examine specific questions of theory and evidence within partial equilibrium frameworks. These share a common concern: considering the (macro economically important) case of mean reversion in real exchange rate expectations. Clapters two and three introduce mean reversion into Dixit's (1989 a) theory model of sunk cost hysteresis in trade. This research uses both analytic and numerical methods to characterise solutions with mean reversion in greater detail than elsewhere and uncovers some striking and unexpected results. Most important is the possible reversal of the stochastic and perfect foresight triggers under asymmetric sunk costs which reflects the essential difference between costly reversibility and strict irreversibility in investment Uncertainty does not always delay action, because the possibility of reversal must be allowed for. Chapter four explores the wider significance of the analysis for similar stochastic saddlepoint models such as the analysis of exchange rate target zones. Chapters five and six consider the significance of the short run dynamic specification of quarterly UK manufactured export volumes equations to the reported instability in estimates of the long run competitiveness elasticity in the light of evidence that UK competitiveness measures follow stationary processes within an institutionally identified policy regime. Hausman specification tests, show that the long run competitiveness elasticity is misspecified and underestimated in recent (error correction mechanism) specifications of UK manufactured export volume equations. This inadequacy reflects the omission of long 'smoothing' lags on the competitiveness variable Subsequently, chapter seven considers simulation evidence from the Dixit model as to the potential relevance of such effects to the UK experience under the large shock to competitiveness of 1980 - 1 but emphasises that the aggregate implications are not clear cut chapter eight considers whether the expectational effects of the 1979 Thatcher government's change in policy regime can be separated out from the other influences at work behind reduced form models but finds that the data do not support the particular approach adopted. Concluding. we emphasise that the potential importance and complexity of expectational factors and theory combines with the our empirical findings to suggest that exchange rate uncertainty may be crucial to trade behaviour and that macroeconomic adjustment may be inhibited by excess exchange rate uncertainty. Overall export performance may also reflect supply factors which are not captured in existing models, such as hysteretic exit. or expected cost changes. But we doubt whether future research will achieve a data consistent <b>aggregate</b> <b>econometric</b> <b>model</b> of UK trade which is fully grounded in appropriate optimising economic theory with realistic adjustment costs. We may have to settle for approximations to the data generation process which do not employ recent theoretical insights. In that event. the use of such models in policy design should be circumscribed due to the possibility of Lucas critique effects, hysteresis mechanisms and supply side factors...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an <b>aggregated</b> <b>econometric</b> <b>model</b> {{of the world}} shipping markets. The model distinguishes between dry cargo and tankers and also between the a) freight market, b) second hand market for ships, C) shipbuilding market, d) scrap market. Chapters 1, 2 of the thesis examine the history of shipping in the last 100 years or so, analyse the cyclical behaviour of the industry, and consider past theoretical attempts at modelling the shipping markets. It is argued that the structure of existing models of the shipping industry is theoretically flawed In its treatment of the demand for new and second hand ships {{as well as in}} the treatment of expectations. Chapter 3 presents a 'new' theoretical model of the behaviour of shipping markets that attempts to remedy these defects. Novel features of this theory are the assumption of 'rational expectations' in shipping markets as well as the treatment of new and second-hand ships as assets, the portfolio demand for which varies with the own expected return relative to the return on other assets. Econometric versions of the theoretical model are estimated from post World War II annual data, separately for the dry cargo and tanker sectors In chapters 4, S. The two models are linked In chapter 6 and the models are used In order to simulate the dynamic response of the shipping markets to anticipated and unanticipated external shocks. A crucial role in the adjustment process is played by the forward looking speculative positions of investors in the second hand and newbuilding markets. Chapter 7 tests the assumption of the rational expectations hypothesis in the shipping markets by examining the evidence from the freight futures, time charter and new building markets. The stochastic behaviour of these variables is examined and statistical tests are performed in order to Investigate the extent to which this Is considered to be consistent -with the efficient markets / rational expectations hypothesis. The results are somewhat mixed. Chapter 8 illustrates how the model can be used for real world forecasting purposes and scenario planning...|$|R

40|$|The years 1990 to 1995 saw {{a record}} number of households, around 345, 000, and thus perhaps one million individuals, {{suffering}} mortgage possession, i. e., losing their homes to mortgage lenders. An important question concerns the institutional response to this crisis: was there a shift in policy? This paper argues that there was a temporary softening of policy beginning in 1991 but that policy had returned to normal by 1995. It examines three sources of empirical evidence. First, aggregate UK data show a fall in possessions beginning in 1991 while arrears continued to rise for two more years. Second, regional data from County Courts for England and Wales show a rise in the ratio of suspended court orders beginning in 1991 and suggest a softening of policy. Third, the paper examines the ratio of court orders to court actions and shows that in 1991 - 94 this ratio was smaller than would have been expected given the economic fundamentals. By pooling time series/cross section data across regions, the methodology is to identify a national policy shift in terms of a common time effect across regions, distinguishable from economic fundamentals varying by region and by time. The explanatory power of this time effect is confirmed in <b>aggregate</b> time series <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> for the UK rate of mortgage possession. The paper concludes by considering prospects for the rate of mortgage possession. This research was supported by the Council of Mortgage Lenders and the ESRC under grant R 000 23 4954.

In practice, many retailers produce the forecasts using simple models with subjective adjustment for promotional events. The <b>econometric</b> <b>models,</b> which could be an effective way of incorporating promotional information, are not widely applied. This research examines the performance of the <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> in forecasting the product sales at the UPC level, asking whether this lack of application arises from poor performance compared to simple benchmarks. Standard models assume constant structure which may subsequently expose the models to structural breaks and then forecast failure. To tackle the problem, we modify the <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> with three approaches: impulse saturation, intercept correction and estimation window combining. Categories are considered as a basis for generalising the empirical results. 29 categories were segmented using conceptual mapping technique and experiments were conducted for those which are distinguishable and representative. The results show that the <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> outperform the benchmark (simple) models for most of the categories and their forecasting performance can be further improved by the modification approaches, especially for the non-promoted forecast period. The explanation may lie {{in the fact that the}} <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> take concerns of the competitive promotional information. However, for one distinct category- the “Front-end-candies”, the benchmark models proved superior.
