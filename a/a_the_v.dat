A partial amino-acid residue sequence of acucetin indicates that the protein has a high homology to snake-venom proteins containing both disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains. Acucetin has been crystallized in space group R 32, with hexagonal unit-cell parameters a = b = 155. 98, c = 76. 07 <b>Å.</b> <b>The</b> <b>V</b> M value of about 2. 97 Å 3 Da - 1 suggests the presence of only one molecule in the asymmetric unit. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) {{disease is}} a {{clinically}} and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders affecting both motor and sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system. Mutations in the MFN 2 gene cause an axonal form of CMT, CMT 2 <b>A.</b> <b>The</b> <b>V</b> 705 I variant in MFN 2 has been previously reported as a disease-causing mutation in families with CMT 2. We identified an affected index patient from an Australian multigenerational family with the V 705 I variant. Segregation analysis showed that the V 705 I variant did not segregate with the disease phenotype and was present in control individuals with an allele frequency of 4. 4 %. We, therefore, propose that the V 705 I variant is a polymorphism and not a disease-causing mutation as previously reported. 5 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Three {{different}} dosing modes, {{including one}} single dosing mode and two sequential dosing modes, were applied in high-arsenic contaminated water treatment.

Besides, the main arsenic speciation governing the arsenic-borne coagulates was <b>the</b> <b>As</b> (<b>V)</b> associated with poorly crystalline hydrous oxides of Fe in sequential or single dosing mode. Moreover, the particle size distribution analysis indicated that the sequential dosing mode was more prevalent in neutralizing and adsorbing <b>the</b> <b>As</b> (<b>V)</b> compared with <b>the</b> single dosing mode. In the FT-IR spectra, the presence of arsenic was highlighted by a well resolved band at 825 – 829 cm− 1. The positions of the As–O stretching vibration bands were shifted gradually as the dosing mode changed from the single to the sequential. This result could be related to the distribution of arsenic speciation in different dosing modes...|$|R
