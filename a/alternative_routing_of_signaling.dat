40|$|AbstractThe p 38 MAP kinase is a {{promising}} cancer drug target but its therapeutic effect {{is not fully}} understood. Here we report that the response of colorectal cancer (CRC) to p 38 inhibitors (p 38 i) is highly variable: while p 38 i induces regression of one subgroup of CRCs, it stimulates growth of another subgroup. We further show that PP 2 AC is differentially expressed in the two different CRC subgroups, which determines the programing of p 38 -TSC-mTORC 1 signaling through differential TSC 2 phosphorylation at S 664, 1254 and 1798, and the antitumor activity by p 38 i. Remarkably, modulation of PP 2 AC level is sufficient to reprogram p 38 -to-mTORC 1 signaling and antitumor response. PP 2 AC expression accurately predicts therapeutic response to p 38 i in several CRC models, including a large cohort of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Moreover, we demonstrate that combination of p 38 and mTOR kinase inhibitors effectively overcomes resistance to either inhibitor in single agent therapy. These results demonstrate that <b>alternative</b> <b>routing</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> transduction underlies differential response to p 38 and mTOR targeted therapies. The biomarker-guided therapeutic strategies described herein provide a compelling reason for testing in metastatic CRC patients who suffer very poor prognosis {{due to lack of}} efficacious drug therapies...|$|R

40|$|Background Individuals with a {{unilateral}} severe-to-profound hearing loss, or single-sided deafness, report difficulty with listening in many everyday situations despite {{having access to}} well-preserved acoustic hearing in one ear. The standard of care for single-sided deafness available on the UK National Health Service is a contra-lateral <b>routing</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> hearing aid which transfers sounds from the impaired ear to the non-impaired ear. This hearing aid {{has been found to}} improve speech understanding in noise when the signal-to-noise ratio is more favourable at the impaired ear than the non-impaired ear. However, the indiscriminate <b>routing</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> to a single ear can have detrimental effects when interfering sounds are located {{on the side of the}} impaired ear. Recent published evidence has suggested that cochlear implantation in individuals with a single-sided deafness can restore access to the binaural cues which underpin the ability to localise sounds and segregate speech from other interfering sounds. Methods/Design The current trial was designed to assess the efficacy of cochlear implantation compared to a contra-lateral <b>routing</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> hearing aid in restoring binaural hearing in adults with acquired single-sided deafness. Patients are assessed at baseline and after receiving a contra-lateral <b>routing</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> hearing aid. A cochlear implant is then provided to those patients who do not receive sufficient benefit from the hearing aid. This within-subject longitudinal design reflects the expected care pathway should cochlear implantation be provided for single-sided deafness on the UK National Health Service. The primary endpoints are measures of binaural hearing at baseline, after provision <b>of</b> a contra-lateral <b>routing</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> hearing aid, and after cochlear implantation. Binaural hearing is assessed in terms of the accuracy with which sounds are localised and speech is perceived in background noise. The trial is also designed to measure the impact of the interventions on hearing- and health-related quality of life. Discussion This multi-centre trial was designed to provide evidence for the efficacy of cochlear implantation compared to the contra-lateral <b>routing</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals.</b> A purpose-built sound presentation system and established measurement techniques will provide reliable and precise measures of binaural hearing.
