5|$|The Globular Amphora {{culture was}} the next major Neolithic culture. It {{originated}} in the Polish lowlands {{during the first half}} of 4th millennium BC, lasted to about 2400 BCE in parallel with the Funnelbeaker culture, and is named after the bulging shape of its representative pottery. They specialized in breeding domestic animals and lived in a semi-settled state, seeking optimal pastures and moving as needed. This semi-nomadic lifestyle was probably necessitated by the poor condition of the soils, by that time depleted and rendered infertile because of the preceding centuries of forest burning and extensive exploitation. Globular Amphora were the first culture in Poland known for utilizing the domesticated horse, and swine became important as the source of food. Ritual animal, especially cattle burial sites, often with two or more individuals buried together and supplied with objects <b>as</b> <b>strange</b> <b>as</b> drums have been discovered, but their role is not well understood. Globular Amphora people were involved in the north-south amber trade. Their megalithic burials included ceramics, stone tools and ornamental gifts.|$|E

25|$|By 1994 Grünbaum was {{considering}} polytopes abstractly as combinatorial sets of points or vertices, and was unconcerned whether faces were planar. As {{he and others}} refined these ideas, such sets {{came to be called}} abstract polytopes. An abstract polytope is defined as a partially ordered set (poset), whose elements are the polytope's faces (vertices, edges, faces etc.) ordered by containment. Certain restrictions are imposed on the set that are similar to properties satisfied by the classical regular polytopes (including the Platonic solids). The restrictions, however, are loose enough that regular tessellations, hemicubes, and even objects <b>as</b> <b>strange</b> <b>as</b> the 11-cell or stranger, are all examples of regular polytopes.|$|E

500|$|IGN {{gave the}} episode a [...] "Good" [...] rating of 7.8 out of 10 and {{summarized}} the episode as being [...] "a much more focused story than 'Because You Left' {{but in the}} shadow of the season premiere's revelations and grandeur it is ultimately the weaker of the two. The comedic moments that string together Hurley's journey only go so far and the rest feels a bit too much like filler... If the conclusion of 'The Lie' is any indication though, the outside world may prove to be just <b>as</b> <b>strange</b> <b>as</b> the island." [...] IGN later ranked [...] "The Lie" [...] 84th out of the 115 Lost episodes, writing [...] "this isn't a terrible episode, but it feels like a bit of a stop-gap, in the midst of a very cool run of episodes. On the Island, we do get to see a pretty cool looking Flaming Arrow attack, that kills the uber-annoying Frogurt, but the encounter the group has at the end with some men dressed as soldiers is just set up for the awesome [...] "Jughead." ...|$|E

60|$|There {{were two}} voices, {{and one of}} these, angry and threatening, I {{recognized}} for that of Rinolfo--Messer Giojoso's graceless son; the other, a fresh young feminine voice, was entirely unknown to me; indeed {{it was the first}} girl's voice I could recall having heard in all my eighteen years, and the sound was <b>as</b> pleasantly <b>strange</b> <b>as</b> it was strangely pleasant.|$|R
60|$|But {{though it}} had {{witnessed}} many scenes and sights, and <b>as</b> <b>strange</b> ones <b>as</b> any old walls in this ancient land, it may be doubted whether the keep of Montfort ever looked down on anything more rare than the life that was gathering and disporting itself in its towers and halls, and courts and parks, and forest chase, in the memorable autumn of this year.|$|R

5000|$|The film's {{production}} {{was not nearly}} <b>as</b> chaotic or <b>strange</b> <b>as</b> the original film's production, largely because of Raimi, Tapert and Campbell's additional film making experience.

40|$|We {{employ the}} UrQMD {{transport}} + hydrodynamics hybrid model {{to estimate the}} effects of a separation of the hot equilibrated core and the dilute corona created in high energy heavy ion collisions. It is shown that the fraction of the system which can be regarded as an equilibrated fireball changes over a wide range of energies. This has an impact especially on strange particle abundancies. We show that such a core corona separation allows to improve the description of strange particle ratios and flow as a function of beam energy <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>strange</b> particle yields <b>as</b> a function of centrality.

60|$|And {{what was}} the meaning of it all? you ask. Many a drama which I have come across in my {{wandering}} life, some <b>as</b> <b>strange</b> and <b>as</b> striking as this one, has lacked the ultimate explanation which you demand. Fate is a grand weaver of tales; but she ends them, as a rule, in defiance of all artistic laws, and with an unbecoming want of regard for literary propriety. As it happens, however, I have a letter before me as I write which I may add without comment, and which will clear all that may remain dark.|$|R

40|$|In FEMININE GOSPELS, Duffy {{draws on}} women's {{experience}} - {{both personal and}} historical - in poems which celebrate, elegise and eroticise the female condition.

FEMININE GOSPELS is a brilliant successor to Duffy's best-selling collection THE WORLD'S WIFE. ...|$|R

50|$|Noda was {{initially}} interested in revitalizing Japanese theater and {{to break away}} from the stylised theatre of Noh and Kabuki. His objective was to be <b>as</b> <b>strange</b> and entertaining <b>as</b> possible, touching on modern values, concerns and social issues. This resulted in a unique and highly stylized visual performance of design and movement. He often takes classical Japanese literature and plays and re-vitalizes them in a modern form.|$|R
