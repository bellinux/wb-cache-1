500|$|In March 2000, Van Morrison {{told the}} Irish rock {{magazine}} Hot Press {{about the impact}} that Freewheelin made on him: [...] "I think I heard it in a record shop in Smith Street. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> it was incredible that this guy's not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it. That's what I thought at the time. The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and I thought this kind of opens {{the whole thing up}} ... Dylan put it into the mainstream that this could be done." ...|$|E

The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and I thought this kind of opens the whole thing up." [...] Morrison's record producer at the time, Bert Berns, encouraged him to find models for his songs, so he bought Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home album in March 1965. One of the songs on the album held a unique fascination for Morrison and he soon started performing [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] in small clubs and pubs as a solo artist (without Them).|$|E
500|$|Throughout 2016, PewDiePie's video style change {{became more}} {{apparent}} than the tweaks he implemented in the past (see above for more). As aforementioned, PewDiePie addressed his use of words such as gay as a pejorative, retrospectively expressing, [...] "I still make kinda stupid jokes that I shouldn't make. But I feel like back then I didn't understand. I was so immature <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> things were funny just because they were offensive [...] I'm not proud of it. I'm really not. But I'm also glad that I've grown past it." [...] While continuing to produce fewer Let's Play videos about horror games, his style of humour also changed; PewDiePie commented in a December 2016 video, [...] "I think {{the thing is that}} I have a lot of younger audience , and I think my humour got drier, and they don't get it." ...|$|E

500|$|The Frighteners was {{released}} in the United States in 1,675 theaters, and opened at #5, earning $5,565,495 during its opening weekend, averaging $3,335 per theater. The film eventually grossed a worldwide total of $29,359,216. The Frighteners ended up being a box office disappointment, mostly due to competition from Independence Day; in interviews conducted years after The Frighteners release, Jackson commented he was disappointed by Universal's ubiquitous marketing campaign, including a poster which [...] "didn't tell you anything about the picture", which he believed was the primary reason the film was not a financial success. Additionally, the film opened {{on the same day}} the Atlanta Summer Olympics began; when Jackson realized this and told the studio, they answered [...] "'We don't think so; our research indicates that's not the case...' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> how the hell do they know? There had only ever been three Olympic Games held in the United States in one hundred years!" [...] Jackson acknowledged The Frighteners tone made it hard to pigeon-hole and sell, and his experience on the film made him understand the importance of marketing.|$|E
500|$|Colin Greenwood {{admitted}} that the band, in attempting to make the disparate elements work together, [...] "felt like irresponsible schoolboys who were doing this... naughty thing, 'cause nobody does a six-and-a-half-minute song with all these changes. It's ridiculous". The song was at first intended to be humorous, and took its title from Marvin the Paranoid Android in Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series of books. Yorke said the title [...] "was chosen as a joke. It was like, 'Oh, I'm so depressed.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> that's great. That's how people would like me to be. And {{that was the end}} of writing about anything personal in the song. The rest of the song is not personal at all." [...] In an early interview, Colin Greenwood described it [...] "just a joke, a laugh, getting wasted together over a couple of evenings and putting some different pieces together". The band used Queen's [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] and the work of the Pixies as reference points while writing; yet Ed O'Brien denies they wrote [...] "a 'Bohemian Rhapsody' for the nineties", and Jonny Greenwood considers it too tense and simple to rival Queen's song.|$|E
500|$|The Prince-inspired [...] "Cross Dresser" [...] has a {{new wave}} style and {{whimsical}} lyrics in which the narrator holds on {{to the memory of}} his lost love by wearing her clothes. Hunt said that he did not intend for the song to have a meaning other than the explicit: [...] "I just thought it was funny. It's {{one of those things that}} people talk about, but that's never really happened to me. But I literally wrote it in 20 minutes. It felt good ... It was really quick <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> it was something silly and funny." [...] "It's a Mysterious Hustle" [...] features somber strings, a languid rhythm, an eerie piano vamp, and bitter singing by Hunt. It was recorded solely by Hunt, who played guitar, keyboards, and electronic drums. Its lyrics are about having to [...] "work your way through the crowd" [...] and [...] "overcome the place you come from", and view the world as [...] "no place to raise a child". Its spoken word conclusion preaches, [...] "If you follow the beaten path, it will keep you tied to the past." ...|$|E
5000|$|Faris was {{inspired}} to create the podcast after listening to Serial.

So I started asking around to some friends, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> asked this technical producer guy what equipment I should buy on Amazon. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> started recording my friends when they would come over. And then with my dear friend Sim, we started flushing out the whole thing, which clearly there’s still a lot more flushing out to do. It started out as a dinky hobby. It still is, for sure—we don’t make any money. We would love to at some point, but we want to know a little bit more what we’re doing first.|$|R
5000|$|Rogers {{released}} his first solo album What Rhymes With Cars And Girls in 1999 after his relocation to Melbourne. Rogers later provided a brief background for an album that was recorded over a three-week period on an eight-track digital recorder: [...] "I had some time alone <b>and</b> <b>I</b> found myself writing some songs <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> well {{it looks like}} You Am I's {{not going to be}} recording for a while, while we're waiting for albums to come out overseas, so I wanna make a record…" [...] Recorded at the home studio of Weddings Parties Anything band member Jen Anderson, the album mostly consists of country/folk-style songs, even though Rogers hesitated at the idea of a country sound. Rogers used the name The Twin Set for his backing band, {{as well as for the}} corresponding tour. He later won an ARIA award for Best Male Artist for the album.|$|R
5000|$|... "We'd {{played the}} Airwaves festival, {{and it was}} about four in the morning, and right outside our bedroom window in Reykjavík there were loads of boozy scuffles. A really {{beautiful}} town, peaceful during the day - then it just went mental at night with drunken fights <b>and</b> shouting. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> the contrast was amazing. We carried on writing the lyrics later, using experiences we'd had, wandering around New York City at two in the morning, the worse for wear, and being excited by the dangers, but also being a bit naive. The big line in there is, [...] "I don't believe that man needs God, thank God". Then it goes on: [...] "I can't forget you, you're all I've got my love". It's saying man doesn't need God, he just needs a good woman." [...] This song is featured in Need for Speed: Undercover as one of the tracks used in the series.|$|R
500|$|... "Dirty Picture" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Taio Cruz, {{in collaboration with}} Fraser T Smith. While creating the track Cruz stated that he originally had wanted American singer Lady Gaga to feature on the track alongside himself. Following a meeting with Dr. Luke, Cruz agreed to switch to then upcoming singer Kesha. Luke had been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: [...] "I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, then I went to a meeting with Dr. Luke and {{he was telling me}} about this new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' or anything like that at that point. But I just thought she sounded really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. I like that with artists, that as soon as you hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> she was talented. Her voice was awesome. It had this — I hope she won't mind me saying this, but her voice has this kind of yodely quality to it, the way that she does things and the way that she ends words. I just loved that quality about it." ...|$|E

[...] whole idea of when you lose people that are close to you, it changes your life and changes your perspective. When they came into the studio, I played them the idea for the song and when [...] was finished, they looked at each other, a bit stunned, and told me that Nathan [...] "Nate" [...] Morris had written a song for his road manager who had passed away. It had {{basically}} the same lyrics and fitted over the same chord changes. It was really, really weird, we finished the song right then and there. We were all kinda flipped about it ourselves. Fate {{had a lot to do}} with that. I know some people won't believe it, but we wouldn't make up such a crazy story." ...|$|E
500|$|Disillusioned {{at being}} typecast as the [...] "sarcastic {{interest}} of the guy", Stone co-starred with Viola Davis in Tate Taylor's period drama The Help (2011), a film she found to be challenging. The film is based on Kathryn Stockett's 2009 novel {{of the same name}} and is set in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi. She met with Taylor to express a desire to work in the film. Taylor has said: [...] "Emma was completely awkward and dorky, with her raspy voice, and she sat down and we got a little intoxicated and had a blast, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> 'God! God! This is Skeeter." [...] She was cast as Eugenia [...] "Skeeter" [...] Phelan, an aspiring writer learning about the lives of the African-American maids. In preparation for the part, she trained to speak in a Southern dialect; she also educated herself on the Civil Rights Movement through literature and film. With a worldwide gross of $216 million against a budget of $25 million, The Help became Stone's most commercially successful film to that point. The film, and her performance, received positive reviews from critics. Writing for Empire, Anna Smith thought that Stone was [...] "well-meaning and hugely likable" [...] despite finding flaws in the character. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, and won Best Ensemble Cast from the Women Film Critics Circle and the Broadcast Film Critics Association.|$|E

5000|$|Powers {{claimed that}} [...] "the best moments of this album are those when vintage Blur styles are evoked with new expertise. The {{meandering}} [...] "Good Song" [...] {{is a beautiful}} case in point. Acoustic guitar picking is matched with temperate drums and a sweet, steady bass countermelody. Albarn's singing is mostly in his mid-range, falling out as easily as breath. Signature background vocal harmonies are there to brighten up the track, but their muted nature doesn't descend into campiness. What's also new is the expert use of electronic noises and drumbeats to fatten the sound." [...] Albarn said [...] "well, that was originally called 'De La Soul' on our huge list of songs, half finished ideas. It was called 'De La Soul you know, right until the end. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> always <b>thought</b> {{it was a good}} song and just called it 'Good Song'.

5000|$|Murdoch's {{interest}} in faith has been perceptible in his lyrics over {{the term of}} the band. Belle and Sebastian's first album included lines about [...] "reading the Gospel to yourself," [...] and on the second Murdoch sang of [...] "the pain of being a hopeless unbeliever." [...] Religious references became more confident and direct on later albums, including [...] "If You Find Yourself Caught in Love" [...] (which continues [...] "say a prayer to the man above" [...] - this line becomes a refrain) on the album Dear Catastrophe Waitress; and the two-part [...] "Act of the Apostle" [...] on The Life Pursuit. Regarding [...] "If You Find Yourself Caught in Love," [...] Murdoch told Gross, [...] "At the time I was writing it I thought, well, should I be so overt? Because I've often couched any religious overtones within characters in the past, {{but this is a}} bit more out there. <b>And</b> then <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> come on, you've been doing this for years, why not? Why not just be a bit more straightforward?" ...|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} following the airing of the episode, Podeswa stated about {{the scene in}} which Jon Snow is resurrected; [...] "I think just establishing {{the right amount of}} tension through the scene, so you really didn't know up until the last second which way it was going to go. That was the biggest thing, creating a sense of mystery and magic around the whole thing. We really wanted that scene to be very beautiful, but also fraught with tension. That's the main thing we were looking for." [...] Podeswa also compared how he shot the scene to The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt, continuing, [...] "It had a very rich, textual, moody, atmospheric quality. I think we were all in that space for a long time for this scene — while we were shooting all the scenes involving Jon Snow's body, really, but particularly the one where he's resurrected." [...] In another interview Podeswa described how the resurrection would play out on screen, noting [...] "There was much discussion about what that actually was: There's this sense of rebirth and whether it should be a big moment or a small moment. We tried a lot of different things, but it really felt to me, and I think we all agreed, this first gasp of life, like what a baby has when it's born, is kind of what it needed to be. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> he did that so great." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson co-wrote {{the seventh}} track, [...] "Where Is Your Heart", with DioGuardi and Chantal Kreviazuk. She {{revealed}} {{that it was}} also about her boyfriend, Hodges, whom she described as [...] "wanting to get really into our relationship, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Where are you in our relationship?'" [...] "Walk Away", the eight track, was also written by the three, with additional writing by Raine Maida. Clarkson described it as [...] "one of the brighter songs" [...] on Breakaway, and said that [...] "It's very blunt and to the point. 'I'm done with you, you're upsetting me.'" [...] DioGuardi and Shanks co-wrote the ninth track, [...] "You Found Me". Clarkson revealed, [...] "When I recorded this one, I was actually in a good place with a guy. It was very fitting {{at the time that}} I recorded it." [...] DioGuardi had also co-written the tenth track, [...] "I Hate Myself for Losing You", with Jimmy Harry and Shep Solomon. Clarkson described the song as [...] "depressing", but felt it {{could be used as a}} foreshadowing device. She explained [...] "I read something that Sting said in an interview, he talked about how the great thing about writing is that it is an emotional and therapeutic thing and you can get it out." [...] The eleventh track, [...] "Hear Me", was written by Clarkson, DioGuardi, and Clif Magness. Clarkson explained the song, [...] "It's is almost like a prayer to God. I haven't met the person whom I will spend the rest of my life with, but the song is a prayer to God about that. That's what the song is. 'God, I'm ready for 'the one!'" [...] The twelfth and closing track is a live recording of [...] "Beautiful Disaster", originally from Thankful. Clarkson admitted that she hated Thankfuls version of the song, and thought the production was distracting from the lyrics. So she decided to record a piano ballad version instead.|$|E
5000|$|... "Prayer" [...] was {{inspired}} lyrically by two events. The first event was {{the death of}} vocalist David Draiman's grandfather, the second was the September 11 attacks, chiefly the response the clergy made to the events. Draiman explained, [...] "Instead of consoling their flock, people the clergy like Jerry Falwell and Oral Roberts chastised them and used the situation {{as a means of}} empowerment, saying it was our own fault because we're a decadent <b>and</b> promiscuous people. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> that whole notion is ridiculous." [...] Therefore, [...] "Prayer" [...] is about a conversation between Draiman and God. In the conversation, Draiman is telling God to [...] "bring it on" [...] if he is trying to use pain to elicit a response from Draiman.|$|R
5000|$|The band built {{a varied}} fan base in Melbourne and {{recorded}} a demo tape that sold out of multiple pressings. In 1995 Sony Music's A&R, Chris Dunn, signed {{them to the}} Murmur label, which had picked up teenage rock band Silverchair a year earlier. Dunn said he was impressed by their age, [...] "If they had been a bit older I probably would've not been as interested. But because they were 19, I investigated it more and {{went out and got}} the tape.". He said one song, [...] "Slow", was particularly appealing: [...] "That really triggered the whole thing in me.

It's animal cruelty. A {{lot of it has}} to do with knowing what happens to the animals and it really bothered me and so I will not eat meat." [...] In May 2009, it was announced that Pickler was nominated for, and won, the title of [...] "World's Sexiest Vegetarian" [...] by PETA.|$|E
5000|$|Dee Jay was {{conceived}} for Super Street Fighter II by American designer James Goddard, {{and is one}} of three characters in the series to have been conceived by an American, along with Blade and Captain Sawada. While Super Street Fighter II was going to feature Cammy, T. Hawk, and two brothers who had the same design save for a head swap, Goddard felt that it would be redundant to have another pair of characters with the same fighting style. As a result, Capcom added Dee Jay in place of one of the brothers, while the other evolved into Fei-Long. The Japanese team asked Goddard for any more ideas for Dee Jay, which Goddard replied by suggesting kickboxer Billy Blanks. He commented that [...] "a really kick-ass black character would be awesome, instead of someone who was more negative, which is what you tended to see from the Japanese back in those days." [...] In {{spite of the fact that}} Blanks is a bad guy in the film which he saw him in, The King of the Kickboxers, he states [...] "his build <b>and</b> look, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> that it would make a great character --high-flying, crazy kicks... I mean, you have to remember, this was Billy Blanks pre-'Tae Bo.' He was so bad-ass." [...] He began designing Dee Jay by drawing a sketch of him and sending it to the Japanese team. He sent the film The King of the Kickboxers by copying a VHS tape and sending it through FedEx. He designed him as a [...] "positive, fun character," [...] implementing elements such as him being Jamaican, a [...] "fun-loving guy," [...] and a person who is trying to [...] "jump-start his music career while kicking a lot of ass." [...] While the design on his pants originally said [...] "MANTIS," [...] it was changed to say [...] "MAXIMUM." [...] This was because his sprite facing left was a mirror image of his sprite facing right, and the N and S in [...] "MANTIS" [...] would be reversed on the left sprite. Lettering was previously used in the same way, with kickboxer Kwon, in the unofficial spin-off game Human Killing Machine.|$|R

She {{went on with}} her low-toned eagerness, [...] "I {{want to tell you}} what it was that came over me in that boat. I was full of rage at being obliged to go--full of rage--and I could do nothing but sit there like a galley slave. And then we got away--out of the port--into the deep--and everything was still--and we never looked at each other, only he spoke to order me--and the very light about me seemed to hold me a prisoner and force me to sit as I did. It came over me that when I was a child I used to fancy sailing away into a world where people were not forced to live with any one they did not like--I did not like my father-in-law to come home. <b>And</b> now, <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>just</b> the opposite had come to me. I had stepped into a boat, and my life was a sailing and sailing away--gliding on and no help--always into solitude with him, away from deliverance. <b>And</b> because <b>I</b> felt more helpless than ever, my thoughts went out over worse things--I longed for worse things--I had cruel wishes--I fancied impossible ways of--I did not want to die myself; I was afraid of our being drowned together. If it had been any use I should have prayed--I should have prayed that something might befall him. I should have prayed that he might sink out of my sight and leave me alone. I knew no way of killing him there, but I did, I did kill him in my thoughts." ...|$|R

[...] "When I heard the doctor reading about them bayonetting the babies, Mrs. Dr. dear, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Oh, what if it were our little Jem!' I was {{stirring}} the soup when that thought came to me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> felt that if I could have lifted that saucepan full of that boiling soup and thrown it at the Kaiser I would not have lived in vain." ...|$|R
