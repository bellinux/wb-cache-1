5|$|After Edward Elric recovers {{his arm and}} {{his brother}} Alphonse's body, Edward is dragged from his homeworld through the Gate of Alchemy—the source of alchemical energy—to a {{parallel}} world of Earth in 1923. The world is fundamentally governed {{by the laws of}} modern science instead of alchemy. When Edward arrives there, he discovers that he has been stripped of his alchemical powers and his newly restored <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1820, Isaac Shelby was {{stricken}} with paralysis {{in his right}} <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg.</b> He died of a stroke on July 18, 1826, {{at his home in}} Lincoln County. He was buried on the grounds of his estate, Traveller's Rest. The state erected a monument over his grave in 1827. In 1952 the Shelby family cemetery was given to the state government and became the Isaac Shelby Cemetery State Historic Site.|$|E

5|$|In August 1914, aged 16, {{shortly after}} the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Ponticelli {{was assigned to the}} 4th Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment of the French Foreign Legion. He had lied about his age to enlist. He rediscovered his older brother, Céleste Ponticelli, who had joined the same regiment. According to Ponticelli, France had done much for him, and serving was his way of showing his gratitude. He served at Soissons in Picardy, northeast France, and at Douaumont, near Verdun. Ponticelli worked at digging burial pits and trenches. In keeping a promise to Céleste to always assist others, he rescued a German and a French soldier who were wounded in the <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg,</b> respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1830 the new railway {{opened and}} by the end of the year was {{carrying}} freight. Bradshaw immediately went into competition by lowering the rates of carriage on the canal and by offering improved terms to the private carriers. By so doing he managed to maintain the volume of traffic carried by the canal, both freight and passengers, at a time when the country was suffering a trade depression. However Bradshaw's tactics led to a sharp decline in profits. At the same time costs were rising, partly due to the use of steamboats on the Mersey. Further competition came with the opening of the Macclesfield Canal in 1831 which gave separate access to Manchester from the Midlands. In November 1831 Bradshaw suffered a stroke, as a result of which he lost the use of his left <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg,</b> and there is evidence that it also impaired his judgement.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{attempts}} to change House's drug habits, with little success. After Cuddy makes a bet to prove House's addiction to Vicodin, House concedes to Wilson {{that he has}} an addiction but says that the addiction is not a problem. It is, in fact, Wilson who usually writes House's Vicodin prescriptions (with Cuddy writing a few merely for leverage in her dealings with House). In Season 3, when Detective Michael Tritter (David Morse) threatens to jail House for his Vicodin addiction after finding a huge stash in his apartment, Wilson {{attempts to}} convince House to go to rehab as the situation worsens. After Tritter pressures Wilson to testify several times, Wilson reluctantly agrees, unknown to House. Before this, Wilson watches House punch Dr. Robert Chase, insult Cuddy, and incorrectly diagnose {{a child with a}} condition that would have required the amputation of her left <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|E

5|$|Gaara first {{appears in}} the series when he is sent to Konohagakure, an allied ninja village, {{to take part in}} the Chunin Exams {{alongside}} his older siblings Kankuro and Temari. In truth, he is sent in order to infiltrate Konohagakure in preparation for an invasion by Sunagakure and its ally, Otogakure. There, he and Kankuro and Temari easily pass both the first and second phases. In the third phase, Gaara is set to fight against Rock Lee. Lee is able to pass Gaara's defenses, provoking an enraged Gaara into breaking Lee's <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg,</b> claiming victory. Sasuke Uchiha manages to give Gaara the first injury he has ever received, causing Gaara to suffer a mental breakdown and nearly manifest his Tailed-Beast powers. This begins the invasion, with his older siblings carrying him off as he could not participate in his current state of mind. Both Sasuke and Naruto Uzumaki confront him with the latter defeating him. Later, Sunagakure sends Gaara to help in preventing Sasuke from defecting to Otogakure, which became enemy of Sunagakure once learning that Orochimaru murdered Rasa prior to the attack. While he is able to help Lee fight Orochimaru's servant Kimimaro, Gaara is unable to prevent Sasuke from escaping from Konoha. He makes amends with the many characters he had alienated, apologizing to those he hurt and improving his relationship with his family. At the same time, Gaara's fundamental characteristic becomes the desire to protect as many people as he can, as in doing so he believes, like Naruto, he will be able to find true strength. This culminates in his replacing his father as the Fifth Kazekage during Part II of the series.|$|E

25|$|The {{system is}} said by Rossy {{to be highly}} {{responsive}} and reactive in flight, {{to the point where}} he needs to closely control his head, <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> movements to avoid an uncontrolled spin. The engines on the wing must be aligned precisely during set-up, also to prevent instability. An electronic starter system ensures that all four engines ignite simultaneously. In the event of a spin, the wing unit can be detached from the pilot, and pilot and wing unit descend to Earth separately, each with a parachute.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{fragmented}} and crushed state of most pseudotooth bird remains, {{it is not}} clear whether the roughly one dozen genera that have been named are all valid. Only the beaks are robust and distinctive enough to allow for good taxonomic delimitation, and even these are usually found as broken pieces. For example, Argilliornis and Neptuniavis were recently found to be <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> bones, respectively, of Dasornis, which until then was only known from skull bones. Size is generally regarded as reliable marker for generic diversity, but care just be taken to ascertain whether smallish specimens are not from young birds.|$|E

In late April, Giffords's doctors reported that her physical, cognitive, and language production abilities had improved significantly, placing her in the top 5 percent of patients recovering from similar injuries. She was walking under supervision with perfect control of her left <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg,</b> and able to write with her left hand. She was able to read and understand, and spoke in short phrases. With longer efforts, she was able to produce more complex sentences.|$|E
25|$|American {{designer}} MacDuffy {{constructed the}} first suit to use ball bearings to provide joint movement in 1914; it was tested in New York {{to a depth}} of , but was not very successful. A year later, Harry L. Bowdoin of Bayonne, New Jersey, made an improved ADS with oil-filled rotary joints. The joints use a small duct to the interior of the joint to allow equalization of pressure. The suit was designed to have four joints in each <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg,</b> and one joint in each thumb, for a total of eighteen. Four viewing ports and a chest-mounted lamp were intended to assist underwater vision. Unfortunately {{there is no evidence that}} Bowdoin's suit was ever built, or that it would have worked if it had been.|$|E
25|$|On 28 July Mannock {{reported}} an Albatros D.V and two balloons shot down but these also went uncredited. On that day Mannock engaged a purple Albatross DV and claimed hits on the enemy leader. This {{may well have}} been Jagdstaffel 12 commanding officer Adolf Ritter von Tutschek. Joachim von Bertrab was taken prisoner of war on 12 August when forced down behind British lines for Mannock's 6th victory. Bertrab's fighter caught fire but his close proximity to the ground (1,000ft) enabled him to make a controlled landing and escape the fire with a fractured left arm and wounds to the right <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg.</b> Mannock also made two further uncredited claims in his combat report but they were not even marked as uncredited in official sources. An RFC communique announced he been credited with only one victory this day.|$|E

25|$|For an hour Littlejohn {{tried to}} keep ahead of his pursuers {{in the hope of}} meeting Hotham sailing westwards from Leghorn, as return fire from Berwick caused {{significant}} damage to Alceste; Lejoille was badly wounded in the <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg,</b> and Alceste disabled, the foremast brought down by British shot. Just as the frigate started to fall back however a bar shot from Alceste skimmed Berwicks deck and struck Littlejohn in the head, instantly decapitating him. The surviving officers, seeing their captain fall {{and the rest of the}} French pursuit squadron closing on their crippled ship, held a brief council where the decision was taken to surrender rather than be destroyed. As Vestale arrive and opened fire, Lieutenant Nesbit Palmer, the senior surviving officer, struck the colours. Shortly thereafter, and unaware of the British surrender, Duquesne pulled alongside and opened fire, although without causing serious damage.|$|E
25|$|He {{began his}} 2000 {{season with a}} {{personal}} best run in the half marathon of 1:01:50 hours, with which he won the Kyoto Half Marathon. He came fourth at the 2000 Boston Marathon, recording a time of 2:10:29 hours on the Massachusetts course. He was later chosen for the Kenyan marathon team for the 2000 Sydney Olympics, gaining the chance to represent his country at the Olympic level for the first time. However, while driving his family in Kenya that July, he {{was a victim of}} a violent carjacking. His pregnant wife was pushed from the car, then Osoro was shot by a gunman in the neck and flung from the vehicle. The carjackers later released Osoro's daughter and sister-in-law unharmed and abandoned the car. Osoro was hospitalised for eight weeks and visited neurologists in London – nerve damage had left him temporarily unable to move his <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> {{on the right side of}} his body. He missed his chance at run at the Olympics and was only able to begin running again in April 2001.|$|E
25|$|One of the para-Alpine skiing {{techniques}} used by this class {{is called the}} three track method, and was developed {{as part of the}} American Training System. One of the first skills learned using this technique is how to walk with the ski so the skier can learn how to flex the ankle, knee and hip. This allows the skier to determine their centre of gravity. The skier is then taught how hop turn in order to understand <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>leg</b> coordination while on skis. This technique is only used while stationary and is not a competition skill. The skier next learns how to fall down and get back up again. The next skill learned is climbing gentle terrain, followed by learning to go down a straight run and learning to stop. After this, the skier learns how to get on and off a ski lift. This is followed by learning how to traverse the fall line, which teaches the skier how to maintain the ski edge. Other skills are then taught including the Uphill Christie, beginning turns, parallel turns, short swings and moguls.|$|E
