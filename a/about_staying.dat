In places where this was not to their advantage for one reason or another, the army would resort to forceful expulsion. I was to wittnes some of these tactics in Rameh a month or so later.|$|E

[...] "I knew if I kept pushing it off, I'd never get it done", he said. He completed his final 32 course hours by taking summer classes in 1994 during the NBA off-season. He took correspondence classes and independent study courses during the following season, studying on road trips and mailing in his papers from the nearest post office. In the end, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in radio-television communication (with a minor in business) at Michigan.

[...] Although Howard had spent the prior year playing in the NBA, he returned to campus to partake in graduation ceremonies with his classmates.

In the song, Montana talks about the privileges and advantages that are faced in leading in two lives with references to Orlando Bloom, concerts, friendship and film premieres.

[...] A writer for Beatweek magazine praised Derulo for sampling [...] "Day-O" [...] into the song's chorus, writing that [...] "'Don't Wanna Go Home' is yet the latest evidence that Derulo can create a song in any genre, using any kind of samples, and turn it into a hit." [...] Robbie Daw from Idolator wrote that, [...] "Compared to his last few mediocre offerings, this single actually seems to have some fire" [...] courtesy of the samples in the song. However, Daw concluded by writing that [...] "if Derulo wants to achieve any kind of credibility in the pop world, he'd better establish his own sound fast." [...] Meena Rupani from DesiHits felt that Derulo [...] "should think twice before he takes his lyrics from others."

[...] "I realized very early that I should not marry, but I was going to make the best of a bad thing, and I was going to make it a good thing," [...] she remembered. Having no practical experience in a lesbian relationship while writing Odd Girl Out, she set out to gain what she termed [...] "fieldwork experience" [...] in her trips to Greenwich Village, and was successful enough to introduce those experiences into the next book in the series before relocating once more to Southern California. But she explained her fears <b>about</b> <b>staying</b> in Greenwich Village, saying I would sit there (in a gay bar) in the evenings thinking, 'What if (a police raid) happens tonight and I get hauled off to the slam with all these other women?' I had been extremely low profile, very proper, very Victorian wife. I know that sounds crazy in the 60s, but I was raised by my mother and grandmother, who really came out of that era, and talk about a rigid role-playing crowd! I couldn't imagine living through it. I just couldn't. I thought, 'Well, that would do it. I'd have to go jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.'
