2500|$|The {{portion of}} Beacon Street west of Kenmore Square {{was laid out}} in 1850, {{intersecting}} with Avenue Street (now the Allston portion of Commonwealth Avenue), Mill Dam Road (now Brookline Avenue), and Western Avenue, a road traversing the Back Bay mill dam in approximately the modern location of Beacon Street. [...] The Boston and Worcester Rail Road and the Charles River Branch Railroad combined here to cross the Back Bay on a separate railroad bridge, making <b>a</b> <b>beeline</b> <b>for</b> the Leather District. [...] The railroad lines still exist on more or less their original alignments, with the city developing around them.

2500|$|The 18th {{episode of}} the sixth season of the satirical stop-motion series Robot Chicken, {{released}} February 3, 2013, features a sketch where, after the failure of Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark, a second attempt is made to make a Marvel superhero musical, titled [...] "Avengers: Musictacular Tapstravaganza", featuring musical numbers sung by Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Loki, and Iron Man, a dance number by Captain America, and a large animatronic Hulk. The musical plays out decently at best until the animatronic Hulk begins to spark and malfunction, causing an explosion that decapitates the actor playing Thor, impales the actor playing Iron Man with a pipe, and severely injures {{the rest of the}} cast. Considering the fact that the actors have no insurance, the musical's director and producer light two Molotov cocktails and toss them, burning the theatre as they make <b>a</b> <b>beeline</b> <b>for</b> the exit.|$|E
2500|$|The {{southern}} {{boundary of}} the fell is formed by Raise Gill {{on the western side}} of the ridge and Shoulthwaite Gill in the east. To say that they drain The Peewits — the hideous bog on the ridge to High Tove — would be untrue, but they are fed by it. Shoulthwaite Gill does not head due east for Thirlmere as might be expected, but turns due north to form the eastern boundary. It is cut off from the reservoir by the lower parallel ridge of Raven Crag and High Rigg and instead makes <b>a</b> <b>beeline</b> <b>for</b> the River Greta. Mere Gill, one of its many tributaries forms the north eastern edge of High Seat. This flows from a point on the ridge to Bleaberry Fell which bears the name of Threefooted Brandreth: (a brandreth being the word for a three-legged stand in an oven on which a griddle was placed when cakes etc. were baked.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Nelson, however, {{returns to}} the island with a crew of henchmen and abducts the girls, gunning down several natives who try to save them. While Nelson profits off a [...] "Secret Fairies Show" [...] in Tokyo {{featuring}} the girls singing, both they and the island natives beseech their god Mothra, a giant egg, for help. Fukuda, Hanamura, and Chūjō communicate with the young women via telepathy; they express conviction that Mothra will come to their aid and warn that [...] "good people are sure to be hurt". Meanwhile, Fukuda's newspaper has accused Nelson of holding the girls against their will; Nelson denies the charge and files a libel suit against the paper. Meanwhile, the island egg hatches to reveal a gigantic caterpillar, which begins swimming the Pacific Ocean toward Japan. The caterpillar destroys a cruise ship and survives a napalm attack on <b>a</b> <b>beeline</b> path <b>for</b> Tokyo. The Rolisican Embassy, however, defends Nelson's property rights over the girls, ignoring any connection to the monster.|$|R
5000|$|Leaving the Brighton line, <b>a</b> <b>beeline</b> {{was made}} <b>for</b> Folkestone, plans to serve Maidstone having been abandoned. A branch line {{was to be}} built from Maidstone Road instead. The line was almost direct between the two points, not varying by more than 0.5 mi in either {{direction}} between Redhill and Ashford. The engineer was Sir William Cubitt. To facilitate fast running, , Maidstone Road and Ashford stations were built with through roads. [...] station was to be rebuilt on a similar plan in 1924. Construction began in November 1837 from Reigate Junction eastwards, and in both directions from Tunbridge. The line from London Bridge to Tunbridge opened on 26 May 1842.

2500|$|IGN {{was pleased}} with Age of Mythologys campaign, and not bothered by its length. Instead, they stated that [...] "the {{meaningful}} and engaging single player campaign provides a nearly flawless experience." [...] However, GameSpot was slightly critical of it, claiming that [...] "while some of the campaign missions do feature some unusual circumstances or objectives that change, the game's story isn't incredibly engaging." [...] This was compromised by stating that Age of Empires fans wouldn't expect an amazing campaign; they would [...] "make <b>a</b> <b>beeline</b> <b>for</b> the game's random map mode, anyway." [...] PC Gamer elaborated more on the campaign however, saying: [...] "many of the missions are extremely well-crafted", and that [...] "sprinkled throughout these encounters are moments of genuine comedy — a truly delightful surprise." [...] However, they still found reasons to criticize: [...] "Regrettably, most of AoMs missions suffer from one recurring, frustrating problem: a severe case of 'build base-itis.'" [...] The reviewer elaborated: [...] "I know base-building is inherent to the genre, {{but even the most}} ardent fan will be put off by just how much there is. What's most disappointing is that AoMs setting really lends itself to imaginative mission design — and I don't think the designers took full advantage of the backdrop, which is a shame." ...|$|E

50|$|The tollway {{passes through}} older, {{predominantly}} residential areas {{for the next}} ten miles. Between exits 16 and 17, the Turnpike Extension swells to ten lanes; this section of the tollway also has the highest traffic count at 172,000 vehicles per day (as of 2014). Past exit 17, where SR 874 (Don Shula Expressway) leaves the HEFT to connect to SR 826 (Palmetto Expressway), the tollway drops back to six lanes and soon reaches an interchange with Southwest 120th Street at mile 19. Just north of the Southwest 120th Street exit, still at mile 19, lies the Snapper Creek Service plaza, which is located on the center median with access from both directions and is the only plaza on the extension; unlike the more robust services along the mainline, it only offers a convenience store inside the gas station. The next exit is with SR 94 (Kendall Drive), followed by the Bird Road Toll Gantry at mile 23; from here, the HEFT takes <b>a</b> <b>beeline</b> path north <b>for</b> the next ten miles. The next exit is with SR 976 (Southwest 40th Street), after which the HEFT gains two extra lanes in preparation for the next two exits. After the tollway forms the western end of the Florida International University campus, it meets the Tamiami Trail (US 41) at exit 25, and then SR 836 (Dolphin Expressway) at exit 26 in Fontainebleau, which provides access to Miami International Airport eastbound.|$|R
