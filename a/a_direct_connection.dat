5|$|Major railway routes through Sheffield {{railway station}} include the Midland Main Line, which links {{the city to}} London via the East Midlands, the Cross Country Route which links the East of Scotland and Northeast of England with the West Midlands and the Southwest, and the lines linking Liverpool and Manchester with Hull and East Anglia. With the {{redevelopment}} of London St Pancras station (now St Pancras International) complete, Sheffield has <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> to continental Europe. East Midlands Trains run services to St Pancras International and Eurostar run services from there to France and Belgium. The Master Cutler, a named passenger express train running from Sheffield railway station to London St Pancras, provides <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> to the capital.|$|E
5|$|R.I.P. 35E {{and other}} citizens' groups {{continued}} to oppose <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>connection,</b> {{arguing that it}} would be no different from a typical freeway, since drivers {{would be more likely to}} exceed the speed limit if it was a continuous roadway to I-94. Saint Paul changed its mind again in September 1981, supporting <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>connection,</b> along with Mn/DOT and the Metropolitan Council. A bill passed in March 1982 removed the stipulation that the parkway shall not connect to I-94, and allowed Route390 (I-35E) to use Route382 (the parkway). The final EIS was approved at about that time, and several groups including R.I.P. 35E filed suit in early 1983.|$|E

The Great West Road (A4) runs eastwards into central London via the Hogarth Roundabout where it meets the Great Chertsey Road (A316) which runs south-west, eventually joining the M3 motorway.|$|E
5|$|The Staten Island Railway {{originally}} {{consisted of}} three lines, but of the three, only the north-south Main Line is in passenger service. The terminal station at St. George provides <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> to the Staten Island Ferry. At St. George there are twelve tracks, only ten of which are presently used for service. At Tottenville, there is a three track yard, with two tracks {{on either side of}} a concrete station platform.|$|E
5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> between Tyrol and Milan, the Grisons and in {{particular}} the Val Müstair became strategically important to the Habsburgs. The Umbrail Pass in the Val Müstair connects the Vinschgau valley (Val Venosta) in southern Tyrol with the Valtellina in northern Italy. Furthermore, the Habsburgs and the Bishop of Chur had been quarrelling over the judicial rights over the region for some time. On January 20, 1499, Habsburg troops occupied the valley and plundered the Benedictine Convent of Saint John at Müstair, but were soon driven back by the forces of the Three Leagues, and an armistice was signed already on February 2 in Glurns (Glorenza), a village in the upper Vinschgau.|$|E

Some of the nodes are called labeled nodes, some output nodes, the rest hidden nodes.|$|R
5|$|Christian metal bands {{exist in}} most of the subgenres of heavy metal music, and the only common link among most Christian metal bands are the lyrics. The Christian themes are often melded with the {{subjects}} of the genre the band is rooted in, regularly providing a Christian take on the subject matter. It has been argued that the marginal yet transnational Christian metal subculture provides its core members an alternative religious expression and Christian identity, and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive message through lyrical content. This may not necessarily show <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> or reference to the Christian faith but often it does.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the railway}} was {{estimated}} to cost £1million. Initially, with the Crimean War under way, the Met {{found it hard to}} raise the capital. While it attempted to raise the funds it presented new bills to Parliament seeking an extension of time to carry out the works. In July 1855, an Act to make <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> to the GNR at King's Cross received royal assent. The plan was modified in 1856 by the Metropolitan (Great Northern Branch and Amendment) Act and in 1860 by the Great Northern & Metropolitan Junction Railway Act.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the growth}} of the Internet, the {{characteristics}} of local area networks (LANs)--computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. When they are not connected with the Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.|$|E

5|$|Finally, after brief resistance, Przemysł II {{was forced}} to give the {{strategic}} Lesser Polish land of Wieluń (also known as Ruda) {{in order to obtain}} his release, because Henry IV wanted <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> between Wrocław and Lesser Poland. The imprisonment of Przemysł II did not last too long, because on 3 March he was documented to have been in Poznań. Henry III and Henry V the Fat were both forced to grant much larger territorial concessions. In addition, the three Dukes agreed that upon the request of the Duke of Wrocław they would each give him military aid in the amount of thirty lancers. So this was, in practice, an act of homage.|$|E
5|$|I-95 {{runs from}} north to south through Providence while I-195 connects the city to eastern Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, {{including}} New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Cape Cod. I-295 encircles Providence while RI 146 provides <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> with Worcester, Massachusetts. The city commissioned and began a long-term project, the Iway, to move I-195 in 2007 not only for safety reasons, but also to free up land and to reunify the Jewelry District with Downcity Providence, which had been split from one another by the highway. The project was estimated to cost $610 million.|$|E
5|$|In September 1990, the Morgantown {{interchange}} was {{relocated to}} provide <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> to I-176; the overhead interchange lights {{at the new}} exit were a nuisance to nearby residents. An interchange was also proposed in 1990 with PA 743 between Elizabethtown and Hershey, but a study in 1993 determined {{that it would not}} improve traffic flow on area roads. The turnpike commission celebrated the highway's 50th anniversary in 1990. $300,000 was spent to promote the turnpike through various means including a videotape, souvenirs, and a private party attended by politicians and companies that work with the turnpike.|$|E

With such an extension, there will be <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> between Changi Airport and the city. Its length is still being decided. If feasible, this extension will start operating together {{with the opening of}} the new Terminal 5.|$|E
5|$|The RTA, later renamed to Sound Transit, began {{planning}} the routing {{of the light}} rail line and placement of stations in 1998. Sound Transit and the Port of Seattle requested that the line be routed along International Boulevard to serve the airport's hotel area, while other officials {{from the city of}} SeaTac favored a station inside the current Sea-Tac Airport terminal to the west. Sound Transit selected their preferred route for the light rail line in 1999, choosing to serve the Port of Seattle's planned North End Airport Terminal, a multi-modal facility with <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> to the airport's Satellite Transit System, and a potential station at South 184th Street to serve the city center.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Strand Highway was {{constructed}} {{and open to}} the public by 1924. What would become SR75 was added to the state highway system in 1933, and designated Legislative Route 199 in 1935. SR75 was not officially designated until the 1964 state highway renumbering. The Coronado Bay Bridge opened in 1969, and provided <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> between San Diego and Coronado. Since then, various proposals have taken place to relieve commuter traffic between San Diego and Naval Air Station North Island that traverses the city of Coronado. However, none of these proposals have gained support, including an attempt in 2010.|$|E

5|$|The vocal {{production}} system {{is controlled by}} the cranial nerve nucleus in the brain, and supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal nerve, branches of the vagus nerve. The vocal tract is supplied by the hypoglossal nerve and facial nerves. Electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (PEG) region of the mammalian midbrain elicit vocalizations. The ability to learn new vocalizations is only exemplified in humans, seals, cetaceans, and possibly bats; in humans, this is the result of <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> between the motor cortex, which controls movement, and the motor neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|Before being {{upgraded}} to a freeway between Britannia Boulevard and Siempre Viva Road, SR905 had <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> with SR 125 via two at-grade intersections on Otay Mesa Road. When that {{segment of the}} SR905 freeway was opened in 2010, the interchange with SR125 had initially been omitted, forcing traffic on SR905 and SR125 to exit their respective freeways and use Otay Mesa Road (which continues to parallel SR905) to make the connection. To help fix this problem, ramps from SR905 in both directions and SR11 westbound to SR125 northbound were completed on November 30, 2016, {{at a cost of}} over $21 million. Southbound traffic on SR125 must currently still exit to Otay Mesa Road at that toll road's south end in order to connect to SR905, but the southbound ramps are scheduled to begin construction in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Clifford {{had already}} {{achieved}} {{prominence in the}} north where, as an ally of {{the son of the}} earl of Northumberland, he took part in a feud against the Neville family, the Percy's natural rivals in Yorkshire. This consisted of a series of armed raids, assaults and skirmishes, and included an ambush on one of the younger Nevilles' wedding party in 1453. Historians have seen <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>connection</b> between his involvement in the local feud in the north with the Nevilles, and his involvement in the national struggle against the duke of York, whom the Nevilles were closely allied with in the late 1450s. Although this was supposedly a period of temporary peace between the factions, Clifford and his allies appear to have made numerous attempts to ambush the Neville and Yorkist lords.|$|E
