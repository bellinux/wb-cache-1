The Screaming Trees' debut album, Clairvoyance, came out in 1986. The same year Screaming Trees signed with punk label SST Records and released the second full-length album, Even If <b>and</b> <b>Especially</b> <b>When.</b> The band would later release two more albums under SST Records, then signed with Epic Records in 1990. In 1991, the Screaming Trees released its first album for a major label, Uncle Anesthesia.|$|E

25|$|The DH.4 {{proved a}} huge success and was often {{considered}} the best single-engined bomber of World War I.

The Airco DH.4 was easy to fly, <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> fitted with the Rolls-Royce Eagle engine, its speed and altitude performance gave it {{a good deal of}} invulnerability to German fighter interception, so that the DH.4 often did not require a fighter escort on missions, a concept furthered by de Havilland in the later Mosquito in World War II.|$|E
25|$|When {{the monarchy}} was {{restored}} in 1660, theatres re-opened. Early {{interpretations of the}} play, from the late 17th to early 18th century, typically showed Prince Hamlet as a heroic figure. Critics responded to Hamlet {{in terms of the}} same dichotomy that shaped all responses to Shakespeare during the period. On the one hand, Shakespeare was seen as primitive and untutored, both in comparison to later English dramatists such as Fletcher <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> measured against the neoclassical ideals of art brought back from France with the Restoration. On the other, Shakespeare remained popular not just with mass audiences but even with the very critics made uncomfortable by his ignorance of Aristotle's unities and decorum.|$|E
25|$|For {{almost two}} centuries, from the {{discovery}} of Ceres in 1801 until {{the discovery of}} the first centaur, Chiron, in 1977, all known asteroids spent most of their time at or within the orbit of Jupiter, though a few such as Hidalgo ventured far beyond Jupiter for part of their orbit. When astronomers started finding more small bodies that permanently resided further out than Jupiter, now called centaurs, they numbered them among the traditional asteroids, though there was debate over whether they should be considered asteroids or as a new type of object. Then, when the first trans-Neptunian object (other than Pluto), , was discovered in 1992, <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> large numbers of similar objects started turning up, new terms were invented to sidestep the issue: Kuiper-belt object, trans-Neptunian object, scattered-disc object, and so on. These inhabit the cold outer reaches of the Solar System where ices remain solid and comet-like bodies are not expected to exhibit much cometary activity; if centaurs or trans-Neptunian objects were to venture close to the Sun, their volatile ices would sublimate, and traditional approaches would classify them as comets and not asteroids.|$|E

2500|$|At a minimum, a {{syllable}} must {{consist of}} either a long vowel or a short vowel {{and a long}} consonant. [...] Like many other Germanic languages, Swedish has a tendency for closed syllables with a relatively large number of consonant clusters in initial as well as final position.

2500|$|This {{was as far}} as {{the project}} got, however, thanks to the {{intervention}} of two unrelated events.

2500|$|On November 6, 2008, {{the writers}} {{followed}} through with their {{plan to have}} Todd engage in sex with Marty. As part of their agreement with RAINN, ABC aired a rape-themed PSA after the sex scene. Viewers and critics were outraged by the show's decision to allow the sex scene, and called the scene the [...] "second rape of Marty" [...] and Marty's [...] "re-rape/rapemance". Not long after the scene, Marty discovers Todd as her rapist. Characters within the series, including Marty herself, interchangeably refer to the incident as rape and as [...] "having had sex". Despite Todd and Marty's dark history, fans of the couple emerged; critics cited this as an irresponsible result of the storyline {{and the majority of}} these fans as young teenagers. They called the storyline reprehensible. Ed Martin of The Jack Myers Report said he had to agree with fans complaining about the storyline. [...] "This tale, though well told, has been sickening given the history of these characters," [...] said Martin. [...] "I don’t believe that sex between two adults can be mutually consenting when one of the people involved has no idea what’s really going on, <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> one of the two is a depraved brute who previously attacked the other." [...] He added, [...] "The writers had already established the inner conflict Todd was experiencing in the moments before he had sex with Marty. (He was even having flashbacks to the gang rape)." [...] Martin argued, [...] "Rather than take her to bed, he should have broken down, confessed everything to her and taken her rage. There would have been no question at that time that Todd had indeed changed." ...|$|E
