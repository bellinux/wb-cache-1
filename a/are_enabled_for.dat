The INMEMORY attribute {{can be specified}} on a tablespace, table, (sub)partition, or materialized view.

50|$|HCCA {{support is}} not {{mandatory}} for 802.11e APs. In fact, few (if any) APs currently available <b>are</b> <b>enabled</b> <b>for</b> HCCA. Implementing the HCCA on end stations uses the existing DCF mechanism for channel access (no change to DCF or EDCA operation is needed). Stations {{only need to}} be able to respond to poll messages. On the AP side, a scheduler and queuing mechanism is needed.|$|E

5000|$|The PaX {{implementation}} {{does not}} allow a memory page to have permissions PROT_WRITE and PROT_EXEC both enabled when mprotect (...) restrictions <b>are</b> <b>enabled</b> <b>for</b> the task; any call to mprotect (...) to set both (PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC) {{at the same time}} will fail due to EACCESS (Permission Denied). This guarantees that pages will not become both writable and executable, and thus fertile ground for simple code injection attacks.|$|E

This {{is based on}} the {{assumption}} that malicious websites can use these technologies in harmful ways.

50|$|For {{database}} storage {{the basic}} unit is a tuple. Tuples in tuple sets handle {{the same role}} as rows in tables for relational databases, but tuples have an arbitrary number of fields, and fields do not need names. Every tuple in a database has one (unique not null) primary key and one or more secondary keys, which <b>are</b> <b>enabled</b> <b>for</b> immediate lookup via indexes. Supported index types are binary tree, hash, bitmap, and R-tree (spatial). Fields in a tuple are type-agnostic. Users may insert, update, delete, or select {{if they have been}} granted appropriate privileges.|$|E

This allows files that are frequently modified to be backed up {{in such a way}} as to allow access to previous versions (up to the version limit chosen) from one archive.|$|E
5000|$|The {{differentiation}} between home network and visited network is technically {{given by the}} type of subscriber entry in a specific network. If a subscriber has no entry in the home subscriber register of the network (e.g. home location register (HLR) in GSM networks or local customer database in WLANs), the required subscriber data must first be requested by the visited network e.g. from the subscriber's home network in order that the subscriber can be authenticated and any authorization for using the network services can be checked. The [...] "visiting" [...] subscriber acquires an entry in a user database of the visited network (e.g. visitor location register (VLR)) and the authorized network services <b>are</b> <b>enabled.</b> <b>For</b> the roaming procedure in practice, the possibility of assigning the subscriber data is always indispensable in order that authentication, authorization and billing of the subscriber can be performed in the corresponding network. Thus, the term roaming is not linked to a specific network standard, but rather to the type of subscriber entry in the home subscriber register of the mobile radio network. If a subscriber can use their personal service profile, which they use in the home network, in the visited network as well, this is also referred to as Global Service Roaming Capability.|$|E

Utilizing a smoothed profile for colloid-solvent boundaries, efficient mesoscopic simulations <b>are</b> <b>enabled</b> <b>for</b> modeling dispersions of many colloidal particles exhibiting many-body electrostatic interactions.

40|$|The Tagged Token Dataflow Architecture is {{multiprocessor}} {{based on}} the U. interpreter model of dataflow computation. It captures the essential execution mechanism of the U. interpreter precisely; operations <b>are</b> <b>enabled</b> <b>for</b> execution by the availability of operand data. However, computational resources in the model and the machine are viewed quite differently. This thesis addresses four major resource management issues essential {{to bridge the gap}} between the U-interpreter and the Tagged Token Dataflow Architecture...|$|E
