60|$|On {{the last}} day of February, 1832, the 'Beagle' came to anchor in the harbour of Bahia, and young Darwin caught sight for the first time of the {{mutually}} strangling luxuriance of tropical vegetation. Nowhere on earth are the finest conditions of tropical life more fully realised than in the tangled depths of the great uncleared Brazilian forests, which everywhere gird round like a natural palisade with their impenetrable belt the narrow and laborious clearings of over-mastered man. The rich <b>alluvial</b> <b>silt</b> of mighty river systems, the immemorial manuring of the virgin soil, the fierce energy of an almost equatorial sun, and the universal presence of abundant water, combine to make life in that marvellous region unusually wealthy, varied, and crowded, so that the struggle for existence is there perhaps more directly visible to the seeing eye than in any other known portion of God's universe. 'Delight itself,' says Darwin in his journal, with that naive simplicity which everywhere forms the chief charm of his direct and unaffected literary style--'delight itself is a weak term to express the feelings of a naturalist who for the first time has wandered by himself in a Brazilian forest. The elegance of the grasses, the novelty of the parasitical plants, the beauty of the flowers, the glossy green of the foliage, but above all the general luxuriance of the vegetation, filled me with admiration.' In truth, among those huge buttressed trunks, overhung by the unbroken canopy of foliage on the vast spreading and interlacing branches, festooned with lianas and drooping lichens, or beautified by the pendent alien growth of perfumed orchids, Darwin's mind must indeed have found congenial food for apt reflection, and infinite opportunities for inference and induction. Prom the mere picturesque point of view, indeed, the naturalist enjoys such sights as this a thousand times more truly and profoundly than the mere casual unskilled observer: for it is a shallow, self-flattering mistake of vulgar and narrow minds to suppose that fuller knowledge and clearer insight can destroy or impair the beauty of beautiful objects--as who should imagine that a great painter appreciates the sunset less than a silly boy or a sentimental schoolgirl. As a matter of fact, the naturalist knows and admires a thousand exquisite points of detail in every flower and every insect which only he himself and the true artist can equally delight in. And a keen intellectual and æsthetic joy in the glorious fecundity and loveliness of nature was everywhere present to Darwin's mind. But, beyond and above even that, there was also the architectonic delight of the great organiser {{in the presence of a}} noble organised product: the peculiar pleasure felt only by the man in whose broader soul all minor details fall at once into their proper place, as component elements in one great consistent and harmonious whole--a sympathetic pleasure akin to that with which an architect views the interior of Ely and of Lincoln, or a musician listens to the linked harmonies of the 'Messiah' and the 'Creation.' The scheme of nature was now unfolding itself visibly and clearly before Charles Darwin's very eyes.|$|E

40|$|Based {{on recent}} and {{extensive}} fieldwork with masons in Djenné, this chapter explores the fundamental yet fragile relation between local knowledge and vernacular mud architecture. Through long apprenticeship, masons have historically acquired technical proficiency, {{social skills and}} a cache of trade secrets. Mastery of these various forms of knowledge has enabled masons to competently negotiate the boundaries of ‘tradition’, and to produce a meaningful living environment. Djenné’s masons have dynamically responded to the changing needs, aspirations and lifestyle choices of its inhabitants, while producing buildings rooted in dialogue with history and place. For more than three decades, a combination of drought, emigration and unstable economy have menaced the existence of Djenné’s mud architecture. More recently, a dam project constructed upstream threatens local livelihoods and the annual supply of <b>alluvial</b> <b>silts</b> from which bricks and plasters are made. Since {{the start of the}} new century, modern telecommunications have ‘plugged’ Djenné into a global economy of things and ideas. A rapid influx of new consumer goods, building materials and technologies is making the masons’ negotiation of ‘tradition’ increasingly tenuous. Finally, a growing pervasiveness of classroom-style education poses a threat to trade apprenticeships and thus to the reproduction of masons as a corporate community of trained craftsmen...|$|R

30|$|The summary {{analysis}} of the stratigraphic column {{of the study area}} shows the presence of three aquiferous formations among them the formation of plio-quaternary one. This aquifer of great extension occupies the major part of the tectonic depression, limited at the West and at the East by two great faults of NW–SE orientation. It is consisted very varied deposits such as, <b>alluvial</b> fans, <b>silts,</b> calcareous crust, conglomerates, and gravels.

50|$|In the Middle Ages, the new {{structures}} of the town were gradually built away from the junction adjacent to the rivers to slightly higher ground because of a rising river. <b>Alluvial</b> <b>silt</b> deposited in the beds of the small rivers - a familiar result of deforestation in the rivers' upper watersheds - had raised the beds of the rivers and extended the floodplain.

50|$|The famous {{silting up}} of the harbor for Bruges, which moved port {{commerce}} to Antwerp, also followed a period of increased settlement growth (and apparently of deforestation) in the upper river basins.

40|$|Wilsons Dam is an 18 m high, zoned earthfill water-supply dam, {{constructed}} for the Whangarei District Council {{to supplement the}} Bream Bay supply. The dam {{is located on the}} Waiwarawara Stream close to State Highway One at Ruakaka. The stream catchment area is relatively small (3. 9 km 2) and a viable water supply in the Northland climate required seepage losses to be minimised. The valley floor comprises a 15 m deep sequence of soft <b>alluvial</b> <b>silts</b> and clays interbedded with permeable sand and gravel lenses. The foundation conditions raised a number of issues for the design of the dam, including seepage; construction stability; settlement; seismic stability; and liquefaction. These were addressed by a range of design provisions that included: wick drains, cement-bentonite slurry cut-off wall, wide berms on the upstream and downstream shoulders, highly plastic core, staged construction, and instrumented monitoring of foundation performance. Construction took place between October 2000 and July 2002 and was hampered by continual wet weather throughout 2001. First filling of the reservoir is expected to be complete by October 2003. This paper compares some design expectations with dam performance to date and presents key conclusions that: settlements were predicted adequately by conventional consolidation theory, and; monitoring and review of stability during construction allowed construction to proceed safely whilst maximising reservoir storage volume...|$|R

40|$|Many {{soils and}} sediments in the Pilbara region of {{north-western}} Australia are highly susceptible to erosion. Large quantities of construction materials are required as iron ore mining and the extensive railway lines used to transport ore to port {{continue to be}} developed in the region. Simply avoiding the use of highly erodible materials is often considered to be too high a cost where alternatives are scarce. Constructing embankments to survive the cyclonic wet season from material highly susceptible to erosion, is a major challenge. Highly erodible materials encountered in the Pilbara include some bedrock shales, dispersive <b>alluvial</b> <b>silts</b> and sands and slaking clays and mudstones. Dispersive materials can erode internally by the formation of pipes or tunnels. Piping erosion {{can be difficult to}} detect and can cause severe internal damage to embankments before being detected. Similarly, slaking material can undergo compaction during wetting and drying cycles resulting in unexpectedly large settlements. The effect of erosion, in general, is controlled by appropriate embankment design and construction, in particular compaction standards. Erosion controls include sacrificial batters, surface protection, encapsulation and stabilisation. For many mining projects achieving short-term construction deadlines is a high priority and adding erosion control measures after construction may be preferred. Predicting the time by which erosion control needs to be installed or rehabilitated should {{be a part of the}} embankment design process. Material selection has direct implications for the on-going asset management of embankment structures...|$|R
