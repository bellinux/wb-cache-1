5|$|According to Walter Breen, Snowden {{most likely}} chose the {{combination}} of the Indian Head and the laurel wreath <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> lowest relief of any of the options, and could be expected to strike well. On November 4, 1858, Snowden wrote to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb about the Indian Head design, and two days later wrote to Longacre, informing him that it was approved. Longacre was to prepare the necessary dies for production, which was to begin on January 1, 1859.|$|E

Pinning the man with a sabre, Williams took him into custody. The other suspected mutineers were also captured.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of}} the Chinese New Year, most of the Chinese Volunteers Corps were on leave, leaving Singapore almost defenceless against the mutiny. The British {{government}} was caught unprepared, and other mutineers went on a killing spree at Keppel Harbour and Pasir Panjang, killing 18 European and local civilians. Martial law was imposed and every available man from HMS Cadmus went ashore to join with British, Malay and Chinese Volunteer units and {{the small number of}} British regular troops forming part of the garrison. British Vice-Admiral Sir Martyn Jerram sent a radio message requesting help from any allied warships nearby.|$|E

Among them, three (Miss America, Foreman, and Table Tennis) are QCIF (176 × 144), one (Football) is SIF (352 × 240), two (Paris and Silent) are CIF (352 × 288), and other two (Susie and Popple) are 4 CIF (720 × 576). Full-search ME with 15 as the search range and fractional accuracy has been employed. We have selected a number of existing techniques to compare with the proposed one.
