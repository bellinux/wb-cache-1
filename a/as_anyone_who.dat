5|$|In 1909 Harold Oliver {{moved to}} Lyrup, South Australia {{and started a}} farm growing fruit. During this time, he captained the Lyrup {{football}} team. In 1909, after never previously winning a game, the Lyrup football club won the local riverland league premiership. They subsequently traveled to Mildura where they lost twice to the home team. The Mildura Cultivator praised Oliver's marking and kicking reporting that it was as good <b>as</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> had played at the ground. An umpire at the game from Melbourne told Harold {{that he would be}} welcome in Melbourne to play football if he wanted to. At the end of 1909 Oliver was contemplating moving to Queensland to join his sister in the state but two friends, the Musgrave brothers, who played for West Suburbans in Adelaide suggested he come down and visit.|$|E
5|$|In post-trial analyses, {{blame for}} the outcome varied. Mamie Till Bradley was criticized for not crying enough on the stand. The jury was noted to have been picked almost {{exclusively}} from the hill country section of Tallahatchie County, which, due to its poorer economic make-up, found whites and blacks competing for land and other agrarian opportunities. Unlike the population living closer to the river (and thus closer to Bryant and Milam in Leflore County), who possessed a noblesse oblige toward blacks, according to historian Stephen Whitaker, those {{in the eastern part}} of the county were virulent in their racism. The prosecution was criticized for dismissing any potential juror who knew Milam or Bryant, for the fear that such a juror would vote to acquit. Afterward, Whitaker noted that this was a mistake, <b>as</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> had personally known the defendants usually disliked them. One juror voted twice to convict, but on the third discussion, acquiesced and voted with the rest of the jury to acquit. In later interviews, the jurors acknowledged that they knew Bryant and Milam were guilty, but simply did not believe that life imprisonment or the death penalty were fit punishment for whites who had killed a black man. But two jurors said as late as 2005 that they believed the defense's case. They said that the prosecution had not proved that Till had died, nor that it was his body that was removed from the river.|$|E

25|$|On November 17, 1975, {{the police}} began to set forth action {{in order to}} bring down the {{powerful}} Dubois Brothers; they established police task forces and began pressuring the Brothers. After some time the pressure began to deteriorate the Dubois Brothers organization through undercover operations and some of the organizations most notorious and loyal associates began to slip away, become informants or had met violent deaths. The papers and police began stating that never before has the criminal underworld’s law of silence been broken by so many criminals, especially those who were so loyal to the organizations core. Among these numerous informants was Donald Lavoie {{who was one of the}} Dubois Brothers most trusted hitman whose previous occupation had been to eliminate anyone suspected of snitching as well <b>as</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> they told him to eliminate.

25|$|In {{response}} to the Ottoman raids, the Great Council of Venice appointed Pietro Loredan as captain-general of the Sea and charged him with equipping a fleet of fifteen galleys; five were equipped in Venice, four at Candia, and one each at Negroponte, Napoli di Romania (Nauplia), Andros, and Corfu. Loredan's brother Giorgio, Jacopo Barbarigo, Cristoforo Dandolo, and Pietro Contarini were appointed as galley captains (sopracomiti), while Andrea Foscolo and Delfino Venier were designated as provveditori of the fleet and envoys to the Sultan. Loredan's appointment was remarkable, <b>as</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> had held the position of captain-general was barred from holding the office again for three years. However, the Great Council overrode this rule due to the de facto state of war with the Ottomans. In a further move calculated to bolster Loredan's authority (and his vanity), an old rule was revived whereby only the captain-general {{had the right to}} carry the Banner of Saint Mark on his flagship. In a rare display of determination on behalf of the Venetian government, the Council voted almost unanimously to authorize Loredan to attack if the Ottomans were unwilling to negotiate a cessation of hostilities.|$|E

The second season garnered more favorable feedback, with Virginia Heffnernan of The New York Times opining that Conrad [...] "now registers as charm".

He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just <b>as</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing.

This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the NSDAP began passing laws to marginalize Jews {{and remove}} them from German society. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed on 7 April 1933, forced all non-Aryans {{to retire from}} the legal {{profession}} and civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions {{of their right to}} practise. The first Nazi concentration camps (initially created to house political dissenters) were founded shortly after Hitler seized power. In a process termed Gleichschaltung (co-ordination), the NSDAP proceeded to rapidly bring all aspects of life under control of the party. All civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations, and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members. By June 1933, virtually the only organisations not in the control of the NSDAP were the army and the churches. In a move to manipulate Germany's middle class and shape popular opinion, the regime passed on 4 October 1933 the Schriftleitergesetz (Editor's Law), which became the cornerstone of the Nazi Party's control of the popular press. Modeled to some extent on the system in Benito Mussolini's Italy, the law defined a Schriftleiter <b>as</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> wrote, edited, or selected texts and/or illustrated material for serial publication. Individuals selected for this position were chosen based on experiential, educational, and racial criteria. The law required journalists to [...] "regulate their work in accordance with National Socialism as a philosophy of life and as a conception of government." ...|$|E

2500|$|The nazirite {{is called}} [...] "holy unto the Lord" [...] (Numbers 6:8), {{but at the}} same time must bring a sin-offering (Numbers 6:11) and his sins are {{explicitly}} referred to ("and make atonement for that which he sinned"). This apparent contradiction, pointed out in the Babylonian Talmud, led to two divergent views. Samuel and Rabbi Eliezer Hakappar, focusing on the sin-offering of the nazirite, regarded nazirites, as well <b>as</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> fasted when not obligated to or took any vow whatsoever, as a sinner. A different Rabbi Eliezer argues that the nazirite is indeed holy and the sin referred to in the verse applies only to a nazirite who became ritually defiled.|$|E

2500|$|The word Türk {{was used}} only {{referring}} to Anatolian villagers {{back in the}} 19th century. The Ottoman elite identified themselves as Ottomans, not usually as Turks. In the late 19th century, as European ideas of nationalism were adopted by the Ottoman elite, and as {{it became clear that}} the Turkish-speakers of Anatolia were the most loyal supporters of Ottoman rule, the term Türk took on a much more positive connotation. During Ottoman times, the millet system defined communities on a religious basis, and a residue of this remains in that Turkish villagers will commonly consider as Turks only those who profess the Sunni faith, and will consider Turkish-speaking Jews, Christians, or even Alevis to be non-Turks. On the other hand, Kurdish-speaking or Arabic-speaking Sunnis of eastern Anatolia are sometimes considered to be Turks. The imprecision of the appellation Türk can also be seen with other ethnic names, such as Kürt(Kurd), which is often applied by western Anatolians to anyone east of Adana, even those who speak only Turkish. Thus, the category Türk, like other ethnic categories popularly used in Turkey, does not have a uniform usage. In recent years, centrist Turkish politicians have attempted to redefine this category in a more multi-cultural way, emphasizing that a Türk is anyone who is a citizen of the Republic of Turkey. Currently, article 66 of the Turkish Constitution defines a [...] "Turk" [...] <b>as</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> is [...] "bound to the Turkish state through the bond of citizenship".|$|E
