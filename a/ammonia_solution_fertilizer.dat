40|$|Jet bubble {{column is}} one of the methods that can be applied to reduce levels of <b>ammonia</b> <b>solutions</b> from a <b>fertilizer</b> {{industry}} wastewater. This study intends to evaluate the entrainment of gas volumetric flow rate, mass transfer, and ammonia removal efficiency. Process variables studied include effluent concentration (90 - 300 mg/L), the liquid volumetric flow rate (10 - 50 L/min), and nozzle diameter (8 - 12. 7 mm). It was found that the liquid volumetric flow rate and nozzle diameter affects the volumetric rate of gas entrainment. The volumetric flow rate of gas entrainment can result in a significant effect on ammonia removal, while the ammonia concentration and volumetric flow rate of the liquid did not produce significant effects on ammonia removal. The overall volumetric mass transfer coefficients (KLa) have been calculated from obtained model and it was determined that increasing volumetric flow rate of gas entrainment have a very significant effect on KLa...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. Absorption refrigeration systems, despite having numerous advantages, are generally characterized by low Coefficient of Performance (COP). Absorption enhancement has been considered an effective way of improving the COP of the refrigeration systems, and magnetic enhancement is one of these. The literature is sparse {{on the use of}} magnetic field for the enhancement of absorption refrigeration systems. A numerical model of magnetic field enhancement in ammonia- water absorption systems is presented in this paper. The flow within the film thickness to the absorber wall was considered as two-dimensional steady laminar flow. A finite difference model was developed based on the conservation of mass, momentum, energy equations and mass transport relationship. Macroscopic magnetic field force was introduced in the model equations. The model was validated using data obtained from the literature on <b>ammonia</b> <b>solution.</b> Changes in the physical properties of <b>ammonia</b> <b>solution</b> while absorbing, both in the direction of falling film and across its thickness, were investigated. The distribution of the physical properties of <b>ammonia</b> <b>solution</b> within the film-thickness was not significantly different (p< 0. 05) from results in the literature. The magnetic field was found to have positive effect on the ammonia-water falling film absorption to some degree. When magnetic induction intensity at the solution’s inlet was 1. 4 and 3 Tesla (T), the increments in concentration of <b>ammonia</b> <b>solution</b> at outlet was 0. 004 and 0. 01, respectively. Relative to 0. 0 Tesla, the COP of simple <b>ammonia</b> <b>solution</b> absorption refrigeration system increased by 1. 9 % and 3. 6 % for magnetic induction of 1. 4 and 3. 0 Tesla respectively.
