5|$|As of 2008, {{there has}} been little {{response}} to Pozdniakov's approach. However, Sproat (2007) believes that the results from the frequency distributions <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> more than an effect of Zipf's Law, and furthermore that neither rongorongo nor the old texts were representative of the Rapanui language, so that a comparison between them is unlikely to be enlightening.|$|E
5|$|Men {{are like}} plants: the {{goodness}} and flavour {{of the fruit}} proceeds from the peculiar soil and exposition in which they grow. We <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> but what we derive from the air we breathe, the climate we inhabit, the government we obey, the system of religion we profess, {{and the nature of}} our employment.|$|E
5|$|The {{explanation}} for the green and red colours {{that make up the}} background field arose during the Estado Novo period, the nationalist authoritarian regime that held power from 1933 to 1974. It claims that the green represented the hope of the Portuguese people, while the red represented the blood of those who died serving the nation. Sources believe these noble meanings are far from the truth and <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> more than propaganda, to provide an honourable justification to their choice.|$|E

5000|$|In {{their book}} The Grand Design {{physicists}} Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow {{argue that there}} <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> before the Beginning, and explain it by comparing the Beginning to South Pole. They say: [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> south of the South Pole", and there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> before the Beginning.|$|R

I do not deny her attachment, but I only say it <b>is</b> <b>nothing,</b> it ought to <b>be</b> <b>nothing,</b> it can <b>be</b> <b>nothing,</b> it shall <b>be</b> <b>nothing,</b> {{compared}} to that of the one who first held you in her arms, and who has always held you in her heart. Mamerzelle can sleep such a night as this, which I'm sure she could not do were she as much concerned for you as I am." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{work is a}} {{historical}} novel in form, {{but it is in}} fact based almost mainly on legends which were current amongst the common people for centuries. Indeed some of the events described there <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> more than Qian Cai's own imagination.|$|E
25|$|The minimum typical {{protection}} {{factor of}} the fallout shelters in US cities is 40 or more, {{in many cases}} these shelters <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> more than the interior of pre-existing well-built buildings that have been inspected, and following their protection factors being calculated, re-purposed as fallout shelters.|$|E
25|$|It is the {{distinctive}} feature of human action, that whenever we choose what we do, we imagine an action for ourselves {{as though we}} were inspecting it from the outside. Intentions <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> more than imagined actions, internalizings of the external. All action is therefore imitation of action; it is poetic...|$|E
5000|$|Ibn Qudamah {{seems to}} have been a {{formidable}} opponent of heresy in Islamic practice, as is evidenced by his famous words: [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> outside of Paradise but hell-fire; there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> outside of the truth but error; there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> outside of the Way of the Prophet but heretical innovation." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{seemingly}} rational decisions {{during the}} game are in fact clearly irrational once one realizes that they <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> more than a greedy algorithm, which is of course not guaranteed to give a globally optimal solution. In this case there is actually a globally optimal solution, which is to not play the game at all unless one is certain {{that there are no}} other players.|$|E
25|$|I admire Furtwängler for his {{originality}} and honesty. He liberated {{himself from}} slavery to the score; {{he realized that}} notes printed in the score, <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> but SYMBOLS. The score is neither the essence nor {{the spirit of the}} music. Furtwängler had this very rare and great gift of going beyond the printed score and showing what music really was.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} sixty years, the city's {{development}} was {{directly connected to}} the railway's activities. The town prospered during the rubber boom, but then when low-cost Malaysian rubber made rubber from the Amazon uncompetitive, the region's economy ground to a halt. Cities like Santo Antônio do Madeira, which had a tram line and a weekly newspaper {{by the time of}} Porto Velho's foundation, <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> but ruins nowadays.|$|E

25|$|Porto Velho's {{modern history}} {{begins with the}} {{discovery}} of cassiterite around the city, and of gold on the Madeira River, {{at the end of the}} 1950s. In addition, the government's decision to allow large cattle farms in the territory began a trend of migration into the city. Almost one million people moved to Rondônia, and Porto Velho's population increased to three hundred thousand. This intense migration caused much trouble for the city. Among many other problems, the suburban boroughs, for example, <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> but shanty towns.|$|E
25|$|The Player {{returns to}} the stage. He is angry that the pair had not earlier stayed to watch their play because, without an audience, his Tragedians <b>are</b> <b>nothing.</b> He tells them to stop {{questioning}} their existence because, upon examination, life appears too chaotic to comprehend. The Player, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern lose themselves in yet another illogical conversation that demonstrates the limits of language. The Player leaves in order to prepare for his production of The Murder of Gonzago, set {{to be put on}} in front of Hamlet and the King and Queen.|$|E
25|$|Theravadins {{believe these}} defilements are habits {{born out of}} avijjā (ignorance) that afflict the minds of all unenlightened beings, who cling to them and their {{influence}} in their ignorance of the truth. But in reality, those mental defilements <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> more than taints that have afflicted the mind, creating suffering and stress. Unenlightened beings cling to the body, {{under the assumption that}} it represents a Self, whereas in reality the body is an impermanent phenomenon formed from the mahābhūta. Often characterized by earth, water, fire and air, in the early Buddhist texts these are defined to be abstractions representing the sensorial qualities solidity, fluidity, temperature, and mobility, respectively.|$|E

25|$|Some learned {{men have}} thought they {{discovered}} some vestiges of vampirism in the remotest antiquity; {{but all that}} they say of it does not come near what is related of the vampires. The lamiæ, the strigæ, the sorcerers whom they accused of sucking the blood of living persons, and of thus causing their death, the magicians who were said to cause the death of new-born children by charms and malignant spells, <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> less than what we understand {{by the name of}} vampires; even were it to be owned that these lamiæ and strigæ have really existed, which we do not believe can ever be well proved.|$|E
25|$|The United States Numbered Highways are a {{nationwide}} grid of highways, {{but unlike the}} Interstate Highway System, there is no minimum design standard for these highways. This is clearly evident as some stretches of the U.S. Highways in Texas <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> more than a two-lane rural road, while others are urban freeways. Although the U.S. Highways have been replaced {{for the most part}} by Interstate Highways for through traffic, the U.S. Highways still serve as important regional connectors. Several notable examples of U.S. Highways that are built to freeway standards include US 75 and US 80 in Dallas, US 59 and US 290 in Houston, and US 90 and US 281 in San Antonio.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} in the German daily Die Welt on April 24, 2015, concerning the Fourteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, Burke renewed his criticism on German Cardinal Walter Kasper, whose “merciful” solution for remarried divorcees who wish to receive communion was discussed at the 2014 Extraordinary Synod. “We are bound by the Magisterium. But some Synod Fathers, above all Cardinal Kasper, want to change it. So I had to make myself very clear. Clashes at Synods, incidentally, <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> unusual. Think of the early Councils, the Arian heresy, for instance, when Athanasius even became physically aggressive”, Burke recalled. He also recalled that Pope John Paul II had ruled out women’s ordination “once and for all”.|$|E
