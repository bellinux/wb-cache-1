5|$|There {{appear to}} be no extant records of the {{meetings}} which elected Arsenal to the First Division in 1919, however the book Making the Arsenal proposes <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>reason</b> for their election in that year. The site argues that the match fixing issues of {{the final year of}} football before the war (1914–15) were used by Norris as a weapon in his battle to get Arsenal promoted. He demanded that Liverpool and Manchester United (some of who's players had been found guilty of match fixing) be punished by relegation or expulsion, and threatened to organise a breakaway from the league by Midlands and southern clubs if nothing was done. To placate him the League offered Arsenal a place in the First Division.|$|E

500|$|During cosmic {{nucleogenesis}} of the elements, {{large amounts}} of neon are built up from the alpha-capture fusion process in stars. Although neon is a very common element in the universe and solar system (it is fifth in cosmic abundance after hydrogen, helium, oxygen and carbon), it is very rare on Earth. It composes about 18.2 ppm of air by volume (this {{is about the same}} as the molecular or mole fraction), and a smaller fraction in Earth's crust. The reason for neon's relative scarcity on Earth and the inner (terrestrial) planets is that neon [...] is highly volatile and forms no compounds to fix it to solids. As a result, it escaped from the planetesimals under the warmth of the newly ignited Sun in the early Solar System. Even the outer atmosphere of Jupiter is somewhat depleted of neon, although for <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>reason.</b> It is also lighter than air, causing it to escape even from Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

500|$|The {{division}} between Russian and Western critics remained {{through much of}} the 20th century but for <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>reason.</b> According to Brown and Wiley, the prevailing view of Western critics was that the same qualities in Tchaikovsky's music that appealed to audiences—its strong emotions, directness and eloquence and colorful orchestration—added up to compositional shallowness. The music's use in popular and film music, Brown says, lowered its esteem in their eyes still further. There was also the fact, pointed out earlier, that Tchaikovsky's music demanded active engagement from the listener and, as Botstein phrases it, [...] "spoke to the listener’s imaginative interior life, regardless of nationality." [...] Conservative critics, he adds, may have felt threatened by the [...] "violence and 'hysteria' [...] " [...] they detected and felt such emotive displays [...] "attacked the boundaries of conventional aesthetic appreciation—the cultured reception of art as an act of formalist discernment—and the polite engagement of art as an act of amusement." ...|$|E

It would be nice if the Azeris would understand that reality is reality, agree and say OK, it's yours, and that's that."

500|$|Heywood {{opened his}} defence on 17 September {{with a long}} {{prepared}} statement read {{by one of his}} lawyers. It began with a frank acknowledgement of his predicament: to be even accused of mutiny was to [...] "appear at once the object of unpardonable guilt and exemplary vengeance". His case rested on a series of arguments which, as historian Caroline Alexander points out, are not wholly consistent. First, Heywood pleaded his [...] "extreme youth and inexperience" [...] as the cause of his failure to join Bligh and the loyalists in the open boat, insisting that [...] "...I was influenced in my Conduct by the Example of my Messmates, Mr. Hallet and Mr. Hayward ... the latter, tho' he had been many years at Sea, yet, when Christian ordered him into the Boat he was ... so much overcome by the harsh Command, that he actually shed tears." [...] Heywood then cited <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>reason</b> for staying aboard Bounty: Bligh's launch was overloaded, and its destruction would be assured [...] "by the least addition to their Number". Finally, Heywood maintained he had intended to join Bligh but had been stopped: [...] "...on hearing it suggested that I should be deem'd Guilty if I staid in the Ship, I went down directly, and in passing Mr. Cole told him in a low tone of voice that I would fetch a few necessaries in a Bag and follow him into the Boat, which at that time I meant to do but was afterwards prevented." ...|$|E

We've grown up with these people, this our family, our community. This was really hard for us... It was like the first cracks on the beautiful porcelain jug with those beautiful flowers in it that was our music and our community, starting to go 'crack'." [...] The Edge explained that travelling to Berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage: [...] "I was disappearing into the music for <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>reason.</b> It was a refuge in a way. That approach didn't completely work. You know, I wasn't really... in a good positive headspace. I was running away, I suppose." [...] While recording the guitar solo that concludes the song, the Edge [...] "put everything into it, all the feeling, all the hurt, all the angst, everything went into that solo." [...] Bono said, [...] "his whole life came out of him when he played... when we went for the take, one string broke and he just kept playing harder and harder. Another string broke. And he has such a light touch, ordinarily, he's so gentle. All that left him {{for a kind of}} rage. And yet there's not one bum note in there." [...] Audio engineer Flood said the [...] "bold, unadulterated, naked [...] sound was a combination of the part, the moment, a good guitar, a small amp, a simple mic.

500|$|With a solid base {{to build}} on and a healthy budget, [...] looked {{promising}} for Forti. The team negotiated for {{the most powerful and}} expensive Cosworth V8 engines in late 1995 to replace the outdated and underpowered ED models, and its financial security was demonstrated by rumours during the 1995 season that the more competitive but less well-funded Minardi team was considering a merger with Forti as a means of maintaining its own presence in the sport. However, these aspirations were dealt a devastating blow when Pedro Diniz signed for the more competitive Ligier team, taking Martin Brundle's vacated seat as the latter moved to Jordan. Forti's sponsors brought in by the Diniz family, including Parmalat and Marlboro, all left; the budget was significantly dented. For a time it seemed that the team would not compete in 1996 at all, and its survival was constantly questioned. The new car was delayed, and the team was forced to use the uprated FG01B car {{for the start of the}} season with the only slightly more competitive Ford Zetec-R V8 engine (instead of the [...] "JS" [...] unit it had been negotiating for), and to rely on temporary sponsors. Nevertheless, Forti remained in the sport for the 1996 season. Moreno was not retained; the team signed Minardi and Pacific refugees Luca Badoer and Montermini to take the two empty seats (although Hideki Noda was also considered), both drivers bringing a small amount of personal backing. [...] Frenchman Franck Lagorce was also signed as a test driver. Pacific had folded during the off-season, and it was clear that Forti would be some way behind the rest of the field in the slow FG01B. Badoer and Montermini failed to make the new 107% cut in qualifying for the Australian Grand Prix and thus did not start the race, but both then managed to qualify for the Grands Prix held in Brazil and Argentina, scoring a 10th- and an 11th-place finish between them in the races. Badoer, however, attracted attention in Argentina for <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>reason.</b> As Diniz attempted to lap him, the two collided and Badoer's car flipped over; the Italian escaping injury. Both cars then failed to qualify at the Nürburgring.|$|E

In analyzing hate crime hoaxes, Katheryn Russell-Brown propounds a hypothesis explaining the disparity in how hate crimes against whites are viewed with respect to hate crimes against blacks. [...] She hypothesizes that the prevailing view {{in the minds of}} the public, that hate-crimes-against-blacks hoaxers intend to take advantage of, is that the crime that whites are most likely to commit against blacks is a hate crime, and that it is hard for (in her words) [...] "most of us" [...] to envision a white person committing a crime against a black person for <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>reason.</b> [...] The only white people who commit crimes against black people, goes the public belief, are racially prejudiced white extremists.

2500|$|For {{three-phase}} at utilization voltages a {{four-wire system}} {{is often used}}. When stepping down three-phase, a transformer with a Delta (3-wire) primary and a Star (4-wire, center-earthed) secondary is often used {{so there is no}} need for a neutral on the supply side. For smaller customers (just how small varies by country and age of the installation) only a single phase and neutral, or two phases and neutral, are taken to the property. For larger installations all three phases and neutral are taken to the main distribution panel. From the three-phase main panel, both single and three-phase circuits may lead off. Three-wire single-phase systems, with a single center-tapped transformer giving two live conductors, is a common distribution scheme for residential and small commercial buildings in North America. This arrangement is sometimes incorrectly referred to as [...] "two phase". A similar method is used for <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>reason</b> on construction sites in the UK. Small power tools and lighting are supposed to be supplied by a local center-tapped transformer with a voltage of 55V between each power conductor and earth. This significantly reduces the risk of electric shock in the event that one of the live conductors becomes exposed through an equipment fault whilst still allowing a reasonable voltage of 110V between the two conductors for running the tools.|$|E
